ILLINOIS\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n    No. 10\u20138505. Argued December 6, 2011\u2014Decided June 18, 2012\nAt petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, Sandra Lambatos, a forensic spe-\n  cialist at the Illinois State Police lab, testified that she matched a\n  DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, to a profile\n  the state lab produced using a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood. She testi-\n  fied that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that business\n  records showed that vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L. J., were\n  sent to Cellmark and returned. She offered no other statement for\n  the purpose of identifying the sample used for Cellmark\u2019s profile or\n  establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample. Nor did\n  she vouch for the accuracy of Cellmark\u2019s profile. The defense moved\n  to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, Lambatos\u2019 testimony\n  insofar as it implicated events at Cellmark, but the prosecution said\n  that petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights were satisfied because he had\n  the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified as to\n  the match. The prosecutor argued that Illinois Rule of Evidence 703\n  permitted an expert to disclose facts on which the expert\u2019s opinion is\n  based even if the expert is not competent to testify to those underly-\n  ing facts, and that any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence,\n  not its admissibility. The trial court admitted the evidence and found\n  petitioner guilty. Both the Illinois Court of Appeals and the State\n  Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Lambatos\u2019 testimony did\n  not violate petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights because Cellmark\u2019s report\n  was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n  asserted.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n238 Ill. 2d 125, 939 N. E. 2d 268, affirmed.\n    JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE KENNEDY, and\n  JUSTICE BREYER, concluded that the form of expert testimony given in\n  this case does not violate the Confrontation Clause. Pp. 10\u201333.\n2                         WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Before Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, this Court took\n    the view that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of\n    out-of-court statements that fell within a firmly rooted exception to\n    the hearsay rule. In Crawford, the Court held that such statements\n    could be \u201cadmitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\n    where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d\n    Id., at 59. In both Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305,\n    and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U. S. ___, two of the many cases\n    that have arisen from Crawford, this Court ruled that scientific re-\n    ports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant\n    unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject\n    to confrontation. In each case, the report at issue \u201ccontain[ed] a tes-\n    timonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal\n    trial.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___. Here, in contrast, the question is the\n    constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019\n    testimonial statements if those statements are not themselves admit-\n    ted as evidence. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (b) An expert witness may voice an opinion based on facts concern-\n    ing the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge\n    of those facts. A long tradition in American courts permits an expert\n    to testify in the form of a \u201chypothetical question,\u201d where the expert\n    assumes the truth of factual predicates and then offers testimony\n    based on those assumptions. See Forsyth v. Doolittle, 120 U. S. 73,\n    77. Modern evidence rules dispense with the need for hypothetical\n    questions and permit an expert to base an opinion on facts \u201cmade\n    known to the expert at or before the hearing,\u201d though such reliance\n    does not constitute admissible evidence of the underlying infor-\n    mation. Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703. Both Illinois and\n    Federal Rules bar an expert from disclosing the inadmissible evi-\n    dence in jury trials but not in bench trials. This is important because\n    Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent\n    in other respects, reaffirmed the proposition that the Clause \u201cdoes\n    not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than es-\n    tablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U. S., at 59, n. 9.\n    Pp. 13\u201316.\n       (c) For Confrontation Clause purposes, the references to Cellmark\n    in the trial record either were not hearsay or were not offered for the\n    truth of the matter asserted. Pp. 16\u201327.\n          (1) Petitioner\u2019s confrontation right was not violated when Lam-\n    batos answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question about whether there was a match\n    between the DNA profile \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of\n    [L. J.]\u201d and the one identified as petitioner\u2019s. Under Illinois law, this\n    putatively offending phrase was not admissible for the purpose of\n    proving the truth of the matter asserted\u2014i.e., that the matching\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nDNA profile was \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs.\u201d Rather,\nthat fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor\u2019s question, and Lam-\nbatos simply assumed it to be true in giving her answer. Because\nthis was a bench trial, the Court assumes that the trial judge under-\nstood that the testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted. It is also unlikely that the judge took the testimony\nas providing chain-of-custody evidence. The record does not support\nsuch an understanding; no trial judge is likely to be so confused; and\nthe admissible evidence left little room for argument that Cellmark\u2019s\nsample came from any source but L. J.\u2019s swabs, since the profile\nmatched the very man she identified in a lineup and at trial as her\nattacker. Pp. 16\u201321.\n     (2) Nor did the substance of Cellmark\u2019s report need to be intro-\nduced in order to show that Cellmark\u2019s profile was based on the se-\nmen in L. J.\u2019s swabs or that its procedures were reliable. The issue\nhere is whether petitioner\u2019s confrontation right was violated, not\nwhether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support\nthe admission of Lambatos\u2019 opinion. If there were no proof that\nCellmark\u2019s profile was accurate, Lambatos\u2019 testimony would be irrel-\nevant, but the Confrontation Clause bars not the admission of irrele-\nvant evidence, but the admission of testimonial statements by de-\nclarants who are not subject to cross-examination. Here, the trial\nrecord does not lack admissible evidence with respect to the source of\nthe sample tested by Cellmark or the reliability of its profile. The\nState offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, and the match\nbetween Cellmark\u2019s profile and petitioner\u2019s was telling confirmation\nthat Cellmark\u2019s profile was deduced from the semen on L. J.\u2019s swabs.\nThe match also provided strong circumstantial evidence about the re-\nliability of Cellmark\u2019s work. Pp. 21\u201325.\n     (3) This conclusion is consistent with Bullcoming and Melendez-\nDiaz, where forensic reports were introduced for the purpose of prov-\ning the truth of what they asserted. In contrast, Cellmark\u2019s report\nwas considered for the limited purpose of seeing whether it matched\nsomething else, and the relevance of that match was established by\nindependent circumstantial evidence showing that the report was\nbased on a sample from the crime scene. There are at least four safe-\nguards to prevent abuses in such situations. First, trial courts can\nscreen out experts who would act as conduits for hearsay by strictly\nenforcing the requirement that experts display genuine \u201cscientific,\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d to help the trier of fact un-\nderstand the evidence or determine a fact at issue. Fed. Rule Evid.\n702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing in-\nadmissible evidence to a jury. Third, if such evidence is disclosed, a\ntrial judge may instruct the jury that the statements cannot be ac-\n4                        WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cepted for their truth, and that an expert\u2019s opinion is only as good as\n    the independent evidence establishing its underlying premises.\n    Fourth, if the prosecution cannot muster independent admissible evi-\n    dence to prove foundational facts, the expert\u2019s testimony cannot be\n    given weight by the trier of fact. Pp. 25\u201327.\n         (e) Even if Cellmark\u2019s report had been introduced for its truth,\n    there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation. The\n    Clause refers to testimony by \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused, prohib-\n    iting modern-day practices that are tantamount to the abuses that\n    gave rise to the confrontation right, namely, (a) out-of-court state-\n    ments having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual\n    of engaging in criminal conduct, and (b) formalized statements such\n    as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions. These\n    characteristics were present in every post-Crawford case in which a\n    Confrontation Clause violation has been found, except for Hammon v.\n    Indiana, 547 U. S. 813. But, even in Hammon, the particular state-\n    ment, elicited during police interrogation, had the primary purpose of\n    accusing a targeted individual. A person who makes a statement to\n    resolve an ongoing emergency is not like a trial witness because the\n    declarant\u2019s purpose is to bring an end to an ongoing threat. Michigan\n    v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___. Such a statement\u2019s admissibility \u201cis the\n    concern of . . . rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause. \u201d Id.,\n    ___\u2013___ . The forensic reports in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming ran\n    afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they were the equivalent of\n    affidavits made for the purpose of proving a particular criminal de-\n    fendant\u2019s guilt. But the Cellmark report\u2019s primary purpose was to\n    catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence\n    for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under sus-\n    picion at that time. Nor could anyone at Cellmark possibly know\n    that the profile would inculpate petitioner. There was thus no \u201cpro-\n    spect of fabrication\u201d and no incentive to produce anything other than\n    a scientifically sound and reliable profile. Bryant, supra, at ___, ___.\n    Lab technicians producing a DNA profile generally have no way of\n    knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating, exonerating, or\n    both. And with numerous technicians working on a profile, it is like-\n    ly that each technician\u2019s sole purpose is to perform a task in accord-\n    ance with accepted procedures. The knowledge that defects in a DNA\n    profile may be detected from the profile itself provides a further safe-\n    guard. Pp. 28\u201333.\n       JUSTICE THOMAS concluded that the disclosure of Cellmark\u2019s out-of-\n    court statements through Lambatos\u2019 expert testimony did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause solely because Cellmark\u2019s statements\n    lacked the requisite \u201cformality and solemnity\u201d to be considered \u201c \u2018tes-\n    timonial,\u2019 \u201d see Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (THOMAS, J.,\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nconcurring in judgment). Pp. 1\u201316.\n   (a) There was no plausible reason for the introduction of Cellmark\u2019s\nstatements other than to establish their truth. Pp. 1\u20138.\n     (1) Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base his\nopinion on facts about which he lacks personal knowledge and to dis-\nclose those facts to the trier of fact. Under Illinois law, such facts are\nnot admitted for their truth, but only to explain the basis of the ex-\npert\u2019s opinion. See People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133. But state evi-\ndence rules do not trump a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to con-\nfrontation. This Court ensures that an out-of-court statement was\nintroduced for a \u201clegitimate, nonhearsay purpose\u201d before relying on\nthe not-for-its-truth rationale to dismiss the Confrontation Clause\u2019s\napplication. See Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 417. Statements\nintroduced to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion are not intro-\nduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose because, to use the basis\ntestimony in evaluating the expert\u2019s opinion, the factfinder must con-\nsider the truth of the basis testimony. This commonsense conclusion\nis not undermined by any historical practice exempting expert basis\ntestimony from the rigors of the Confrontation Clause. Before the\nFederal Rules of Evidence were adopted in 1975, an expert could ren-\nder an opinion based only on facts that the expert had personally per-\nceived or learned at trial. In 1975, that universe of facts was ex-\npanded to include facts that the expert learned out of court by means\nother than his own perception. The disclosure of such facts raises\nConfrontation Clause concerns. Pp. 2\u20135.\n     (2) Those concerns are fully applicable here. In concluding that\npetitioner\u2019s DNA profile matched the profile derived from L. J.\u2019s\nswabs, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\u2019s out-of-court statements that\nits profile was in fact derived from those swabs, rather than from\nsome other source. Thus, the validity of Lambatos\u2019 opinion ultimate-\nly turned on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statements. Pp. 5\u20137.\n   (b) These statements, however, were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes\nof the Confrontation Clause, which \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the\naccused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U. S. 36, 51. \u201c \u2018Testimony,\u2019 \u201d in turn, is \u201c \u2018[a] solemn\ndeclaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or\nproving some fact.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. In light of its text, the Confrontation\nClause regulates only the use of statements bearing \u201cindicia of so-\nlemnity.\u201d Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 836\u2013837, 840 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.). This test comports with history because solemnity\nmarked the practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed to\neliminate, namely, the ex parte examination of witnesses under Eng-\nlish bail and committal statutes. See id., at 835. Accordingly, the\nClause reaches \u201cformalized testimonial materials,\u201d such as deposi-\n6                        WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from\n    \u201cformalized dialogue,\u201d such as custodial interrogation. Bryant, supra,\n    at ___. Applying these principles, Cellmark\u2019s report is not a state-\n    ment by a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d under the Confrontation Clause. It lacks the\n    solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is neither a sworn nor a\n    certified declaration of fact. And, although it was produced at the re-\n    quest of law enforcement, it was not the product of formalized dia-\n    logue resembling custodial interrogation. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.

Washing-\nton, 541 U. S. 36, 50 (2004), precludes an expert witness\nfrom testifying in a manner that has long been allowed\nunder the law of evidence. Specifically, does Crawford bar\nan expert from expressing an opinion based on facts about\na case that have been made known to the expert but about\nwhich the expert is not competent to testify? We also\ndecide whether Crawford substantially impedes the ability\nof prosecutors to introduce DNA evidence and thus may\neffectively relegate the prosecution in some cases to reli-\nance on older, less reliable forms of proof.\n   In petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, the prosecution\ncalled an expert who testified that a DNA profile produced\nby an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile\nproduced by the state police lab using a sample of peti-\ntioner\u2019s blood. On direct examination, the expert testified\nthat Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that\nCellmark provided the police with a DNA profile. The\nexpert also explained the notations on documents admit-\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nted as business records, stating that, according to the\nrecords, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to\nand received back from Cellmark. The expert made no\nother statement that was offered for the purpose of identi-\nfying the sample of biological material used in deriving\nthe profile or for the purpose of establishing how Cellmark\nhandled or tested the sample. Nor did the expert vouch\nfor the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark produced.\nNevertheless, petitioner contends that the expert\u2019s testi-\nmony violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in\nCrawford.\n   Petitioner\u2019s main argument is that the expert went\nastray when she referred to the DNA profile provided by\nCellmark as having been produced from semen found on\nthe victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. But both the Illinois Appellate\nCourt and the Illinois Supreme Court found that this\nstatement was not admitted for the truth of the matter\nasserted, and it is settled that the Confrontation Clause\ndoes not bar the admission of such statements. See id., at\n59\u201360, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409\n(1985)). For more than 200 years, the law of evidence has\npermitted the sort of testimony that was given by the ex-\npert in this case. Under settled evidence law, an expert\nmay express an opinion that is based on facts that the\nexpert assumes, but does not know, to be true. It is then\nup to the party who calls the expert to introduce other\nevidence establishing the facts assumed by the expert.\nWhile it was once the practice for an expert who based\nan opinion on assumed facts to testify in the form of an an-\nswer to a hypothetical question, modern practice does not\ndemand this formality and, in appropriate cases, permits\nan expert to explain the facts on which his or her opinion\nis based without testifying to the truth of those facts. See\nFed. Rule Evid. 703. That is precisely what occurred in\nthis case, and we should not lightly \u201cswee[p] away an\naccepted rule governing the admission of scientific evi-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndence.\u201d Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305,\n330 (2009) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   We now conclude that this form of expert testimony does\nnot violate the Confrontation Clause because that provi-\nsion has no application to out-of-court statements that\nare not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\nWhen an expert testifies for the prosecution in a criminal\ncase, the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine\nthe expert about any statements that are offered for their\ntruth. Out-of-court statements that are related by the\nexpert solely for the purpose of explaining the assump-\ntions on which that opinion rests are not offered for their\ntruth and thus fall outside the scope of the Confrontation\nClause. Applying this rule to the present case, we con-\nclude that the expert\u2019s testimony did not violate the Sixth\nAmendment.\n   As a second, independent basis for our decision, we also\nconclude that even if the report produced by Cellmark had\nbeen admitted into evidence, there would have been no\nConfrontation Clause violation. The Cellmark report is\nvery different from the sort of extrajudicial statements,\nsuch as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and con-\nfessions, that the Confrontation Clause was originally\nunderstood to reach. The report was produced before any\nsuspect was identified. The report was sought not for the\npurpose of obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner,\nwho was not even under suspicion at the time, but for\nthe purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose. And\nthe profile that Cellmark provided was not inherently\ninculpatory. On the contrary, a DNA profile is evidence\nthat tends to exculpate all but one of the more than 7\nbillion people in the world today. The use of DNA evi-\ndence to exonerate persons who have been wrongfully\naccused or convicted is well known. If DNA profiles could\nnot be introduced without calling the technicians who\nparticipated in the preparation of the profile, economic\n4                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\npressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA\ntesting and rely instead on older forms of evidence, such\nas eyewitness identification, that are less reliable. See\nPerry v. New Hampshire, 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The Con-\nfrontation Clause does not mandate such an undesirable\ndevelopment. This conclusion will not prejudice any de-\nfendant who really wishes to probe the reliability of the\nDNA testing done in a particular case because those who\nparticipated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by\nthe defense and questioned at trial.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  On February 10, 2000, in Chicago, Illinois, a young\nwoman, L. J., was abducted while she was walking home\nfrom work. The perpetrator forced her into his car and\nraped her, then robbed her of her money and other per-\nsonal items and pushed her out into the street. L. J. ran\nhome and reported the attack to her mother, who called\nthe police. An ambulance took L. J. to the hospital, where\ndoctors treated her wounds and took a blood sample and\nvaginal swabs for a sexual-assault kit. A Chicago Police\ndetective collected the kit, labeled it with an inventory\nnumber, and sent it under seal to the Illinois State Police\n(ISP) lab.\n  At the ISP lab, a forensic scientist received the sealed\nkit. He conducted a chemical test that confirmed the\npresence of semen on the vaginal swabs, and he then\nresealed the kit and placed it in a secure evidence freezer.\n  During the period in question, the ISP lab often sent\nbiological samples to Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory in\nGermantown, Maryland, for DNA testing. There was\nevidence that the ISP lab sent L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs to\nCellmark for testing and that Cellmark sent back a report\ncontaining a male DNA profile produced from semen taken\nfrom those swabs. At this time, petitioner was not under\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nsuspicion for L. J.\u2019s rape.\n   Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the ISP lab,\nconducted a computer search to see if the Cellmark profile\nmatched any of the entries in the state DNA database.\nThe computer showed a match to a profile produced by the\nlab from a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood that had been taken\nafter he was arrested on unrelated charges on August 3,\n2000.\n   On April 17, 2001, the police conducted a lineup at\nwhich L. J. identified petitioner as her assailant. Peti-\ntioner was then indicted for aggravated criminal sexual\nassault, aggravated kidnaping, and aggravated robbery.\nIn lieu of a jury trial, petitioner chose to be tried before a\nstate judge.\n                              B\n   Petitioner\u2019s bench trial began in April 2006. In open\ncourt, L. J. again identified petitioner as her attacker.\nThe State also offered three expert forensic witnesses to\nlink petitioner to the crime through his DNA. First, Brian\nHapack, an ISP forensic scientist, testified that he had\nconfirmed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs\ntaken from L. J. by performing an acid phosphatase test.\nAfter performing this test, he testified, he resealed the\nevidence and left it in a secure freezer at the ISP lab.\n   Second, Karen Abbinanti, a state forensic analyst, testi-\nfied that she had used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nand Short Tandem Repeat (STR) techniques to develop a\nDNA profile from a blood sample that had been drawn\nfrom petitioner after he was arrested in August 2000. She\nalso stated that she had entered petitioner\u2019s DNA profile\ninto the state forensic database.\n   Third, the State offered Sandra Lambatos as an expert\nwitness in forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis. On\ndirect examination, Lambatos testified about the general\nprocess of using the PCR and STR techniques to generate\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nDNA profiles from forensic samples such as blood and\nsemen. She then described how these DNA profiles could\nbe matched to an individual based on the individual\u2019s\nunique genetic code. In making a comparison between two\nDNA profiles, Lambatos stated, it is a \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d\npractice within the scientific community for \u201cone DNA\nexpert to rely on the records of another DNA expert.\u201d App.\n51. Lambatos also testified that Cellmark was an \u201caccred-\nited crime lab\u201d and that, in her experience, the ISP lab\nroutinely sent evidence samples via Federal Express to\nCellmark for DNA testing in order to expedite the testing\nprocess and to \u201creduce [the lab\u2019s] backlog.\u201d Id., at 49\u201350.\nTo keep track of evidence samples and preserve the chain\nof custody, Lambatos stated, she and other analysts relied\non sealed shipping containers and labeled shipping mani-\nfests, and she added that experts in her field regularly\nrelied on such protocols. Id., at 50\u201351.\n   Lambatos was shown shipping manifests that were\nadmitted into evidence as business records, and she ex-\nplained what they indicated, namely, that the ISP lab had\nsent L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs to Cellmark, and that Cellmark\nhad sent them back, along with a deduced male DNA\nprofile. Id., at 52\u201355. The prosecutor asked Lambatos\nwhether there was \u201ca computer match\u201d between \u201cthe male\nDNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of\n[L. J.]\u201d and \u201c[the] male DNA profile that had been identi-\nfied\u201d from petitioner\u2019s blood sample. Id., at 55.\n   The defense attorney objected to this question for \u201clack\nof foundation,\u201d arguing that the prosecution had offered\n\u201cno evidence with regard to any testing that\u2019s been done to\ngenerate a DNA profile by another lab to be testified to by\nthis witness.\u201d Ibid.\n   The prosecutor responded: \u201cI\u2018m not getting at what\nanother lab did.\u201d Id., at 56. Rather, she said, she was\nsimply asking Lambatos about \u201cher own testing based on\n[DNA] information\u201d that she had received from Cellmark.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nIbid. The trial judge agreed, noting, \u201cIf she says she didn\u2019t\ndo her own testing and she relied on a test of another lab\nand she\u2019s testifying to that, we will see what she\u2019s going to\nsay.\u201d Ibid.\n   The prosecutor then proceeded, asking Lambatos, \u201cDid\nyou compare the semen that had been identified by Brian\nHapack from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.] to the male DNA\nprofile that had been identified by Karen [Abbinanti] from\nthe blood of [petitioner]?\u201d Ibid.\n   Lambatos answered \u201cYes.\u201d Ibid. Defense counsel\nlodged an objection \u201cto the form of the question,\u201d but the\ntrial judge overruled it. Ibid. Lambatos then testified\nthat, based on her own comparison of the two DNA pro-\nfiles, she \u201cconcluded that [petitioner] cannot be excluded\nas a possible source of the semen identified in the vaginal\nswabs,\u201d and that the probability of the profile\u2019s appearing\nin the general population was \u201c1 in 8.7 quadrillion black,\n1 in 390 quadrillion white, or 1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic\nunrelated individuals.\u201d Id., at 57. Asked whether she\nwould \u201ccall this a match to [petitioner],\u201d Lambatos an-\nswered yes, again over defense counsel\u2019s objection. Id.,\nat 58.\n   The Cellmark report itself was neither admitted into\nevidence nor shown to the factfinder. Lambatos did not\nquote or read from the report; nor did she identify it as the\nsource of any of the opinions she expressed.\n   On cross-examination, Lambatos confirmed that she did\nnot conduct or observe any of the testing on the vaginal\nswabs, and that her testimony relied on the DNA profile\nproduced by Cellmark. Id., at 59. She stated that she\ntrusted Cellmark to do reliable work because it was an\naccredited lab, but she admitted she had not seen any of\nthe calibrations or work that Cellmark had done in deduc-\ning a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs. Id., at\n59\u201362.\n   Asked whether the DNA sample might have been de-\n8                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                        Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ngraded before Cellmark analyzed it, Lambatos answered\nthat, while degradation was technically possible, she\nstrongly doubted it had occurred in this case. She gave\ntwo reasons. First, the ISP lab likely would have noticed\nthe degradation before sending the evidence off to Cell-\nmark. Second, and more important, Lambatos also noted\nthat the data making up the DNA profile would ex-\nhibit certain telltale signs if it had been deduced from a\ndegraded sample: The visual representation of the DNA\nsequence would exhibit \u201cspecific patterns\u201d of degradation,\nand she \u201cdidn\u2019t see any evidence\u201d of that from looking at\nthe profile that Cellmark produced. Id., at 81\u201382.\n   When Lambatos finished testifying, the defense moved\nto exclude her testimony \u201cwith regards to testing done by\n[Cellmark]\u201d based on the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 90.\nDefense counsel argued that there was \u201cno evidence with\nregards to . . . any work done by [Cellmark] to justify\ntestimony coming into this case with regard to their anal-\nysis.\u201d Ibid. Thus, while defense counsel objected to and\nsought the exclusion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony insofar as it\nimplicated events at the Cellmark lab, defense counsel did\nnot object to or move for the exclusion of any other portion\nof Lambatos\u2019 testimony, including statements regarding\nthe contents of the shipment sent to or received back from\nCellmark. See id., at 55, 56, 90. See also 385 Ill. App. 3d\n359, 367\u2013368, 895 N. E. 2d 961, 968 (2008) (chain-of-\ncustody argument based on shipping manifests waived).\n   The prosecution responded that petitioner\u2019s Confronta-\ntion Clause rights were satisfied because he had the op-\nportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified\nthat there was a match between the DNA profiles pro-\nduced by Cellmark and Abbinanti. App. 91. Invoking\nIllinois Rule of Evidence 703,1 the prosecutor argued that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Consistent with the Federal Rules, Illinois Rule of Evidence 703\n\nprovides as follows:\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

She further ar-\ngued that any deficiency in the foundation for the expert\u2019s\nopinion \u201c[d]oesn\u2019t go to the admissibility of [that] testi-\nmony,\u201d but instead \u201cgoes to the weight of the testimony.\u201d\nApp. 91.\n   The trial judge agreed with the prosecution and stated\nthat \u201cthe issue is . . . what weight do you give the test, not\ndo you exclude it.\u201d Id., at 94. Accordingly, the judge\nstated that he would not exclude Lambatos\u2019 testimony,\nwhich was \u201cbased on her own independent testing of the\ndata received from [Cellmark].\u201d Id., at 94\u201395 (alteration\nin original).\n   The trial court found petitioner guilty of the charges\nagainst him. The state court of appeals affirmed in rele-\nvant part, concluding that Lambatos\u2019 testimony did not\nviolate petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights because the Cell-\nmark report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth\nof the matter it asserted. See 385 Ill. App. 3d, at 369,\n895 N. E. 2d, at 969\u2013970 (\u201cCellmark\u2019s report was not\noffered for the truth of the matter asserted; rather, it was\noffered to provide a basis for Lambatos\u2019 opinion\u201d) The\nSupreme Court of Illinois also affirmed. 238 Ill. 2d 125,\n939 N. E. 2d 268 (2010). Under state law, the court noted,\nthe Cellmark report could not be used as substantive\nevidence. When Lambatos referenced the report during\nher direct examination, she did so \u201cfor the limited purpose\nof explaining the basis for [her expert opinion],\u201d not for the\npurpose of showing \u201cthe truth of the matter asserted\u201d by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases\n an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to\n the expert at or before the hearing.

Roberts,\n448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980), but in Crawford, the Court adopted\na fundamentally new interpretation of the confronta-\ntion right, holding that \u201c[t]estimonial statements of wit-\nnesses absent from trial [can be] admitted only where the\ndeclarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant\nhas had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 59. Crawford has resulted in a steady stream of new\ncases in this Court. See Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011); Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___ (2011);\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S. 305; Giles v. California, 554\nU. S. 353 (2008); Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164\n(2008); Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S. 813 (2006).\n   Two of these decisions involved scientific reports. In\nMelendez-Diaz, the defendant was arrested and charged\nwith distributing and trafficking in cocaine. At trial, the\nprosecution introduced bags of a white powdery substance\nthat had been found in the defendant\u2019s possession. The\ntrial court also admitted into evidence three \u201ccertificates of\nanalysis\u201d from the state forensic laboratory stating that\nthe bags had been \u201cexamined with the following results:\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nThe substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\u201d 557 U. S.,\nat 308 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court held that the admission of these certificates,\nwhich were executed under oath before a notary, violated\nthe Sixth Amendment. They were created for \u201cthe sole\npurpose of providing evidence against a defendant,\u201d id.,\nat 323, and were \u201c \u2018quite plainly affidavits,\u2019 \u201d id., at 330\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). The Court emphasized that the\nintroduction of the report to prove the nature of the sub-\nstance found in the defendant\u2019s possession was tanta-\nmount to \u201clive, in-court testimony\u201d on that critical fact and\nthat the certificates did \u201cprecisely what a witness does on\ndirect examination.\u201d Id., at 311 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). There was no doubt that the certificates were\nused to prove the truth of the matter they asserted. Un-\nder state law, \u201cthe sole purpose of the affidavits was to\nprovide prima facie evidence of the composition, quality,\nand the net weight of the analyzed substance.\u201d Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis deleted).\nOn these facts, the Court said, it was clear that the certif-\nicates were \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d that could not be\nintroduced unless their authors were subjected to the \u201c \u2018cru-\ncible of cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 311, 317 (quoting\nCrawford, supra, at 61).\n   In Bullcoming, we held that another scientific report\ncould not be used as substantive evidence against the de-\nfendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified\nthe report was subject to confrontation. The defendant in\nthat case had been convicted of driving while intoxicated.\nAt trial, the court admitted into evidence a forensic report\ncertifying that a sample of the defendant\u2019s blood had an\nalcohol concentration of 0.21 grams per hundred milli-\nliters, well above the legal limit. Instead of calling the\nanalyst who signed and certified the forensic report, the\nprosecution called another analyst who had not performed\nor observed the actual analysis, but was only familiar with\n12                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe general testing procedures of the laboratory. The\nCourt declined to accept this surrogate testimony, despite\nthe fact that the testifying analyst was a \u201cknowledgeable\nrepresentative of the laboratory\u201d who could \u201cexplain the\nlab\u2019s processes and the details of the report.\u201d 564 U. S., at\n___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). The Court\nstated simply: \u201cThe accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with\nthe analyst who made the certification.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 2).\n   Just as in Melendez-Diaz, the forensic report that was\n\u201cintroduce[d]\u201d in Bullcoming \u201ccontain[ed] a testimonial\ncertification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal\ntrial.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 7\u20138). The report\nwas signed by the nontestifying analyst who had authored\nit, stating, \u201cI certify that I followed the procedures set out\non the reverse of this report, and the statements in this\nblock are correct. The concentration of alcohol in this\nsample is based on the grams of alcohol in one hundred\nmilliliters of blood.\u201d App. in Bullcoming, O. T. 2010,\nNo. 09\u201310876, p. 62. Critically, the report was introduced\nat trial for the substantive purpose of proving the truth\nof the matter asserted by its out-of-court author\u2014namely,\nthat the defendant had a blood-alcohol level of 0.21. This\nwas the central fact in question at the defendant\u2019s trial,\nand it was dispositive of his guilt.\n   In concurrence, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR highlighted the im-\nportance of the fact that the forensic report had been\nadmitted into evidence for the purpose of proving the truth\nof the matter it asserted. She emphasized that \u201cthis [was]\nnot a case in which an expert witness was asked for his\nindependent opinion about underlying testimonial reports\nthat were not themselves admitted into evidence.\u201d 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (opinion concurring in part)\n(citing Fed. Rule Evid. 703). \u201cWe would face a different\nquestion,\u201d she observed, \u201cif asked to determine the consti-\ntutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ntestimonial statements if the testimonial statements were\nnot themselves admitted as evidence.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 6).\n  We now confront that question.\n                              B\n   It has long been accepted that an expert witness may\nvoice an opinion based on facts concerning the events at\nissue in a particular case even if the expert lacks first-\nhand knowledge of those facts.\n   At common law, courts developed two ways to deal with\nthis situation. An expert could rely on facts that had\nalready been established in the record. But because it was\nnot always possible to proceed in this manner, and be-\ncause record evidence was often disputed, courts devel-\noped the alternative practice of allowing an expert to\ntestify in the form of a \u201chypothetical question.\u201d Under this\napproach, the expert would be asked to assume the truth\nof certain factual predicates, and was then asked to offer\nan opinion based on those assumptions. See 1 K. Broun,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a714, p. 87 (6th ed. 2006); 1\nJ. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7677, p. 1084 (2d ed. 1923) (\u201cIf the\nwitness is skilled enough, his opinion may be adequately\nobtained upon hypothetical data alone; and it is immate-\nrial whether he has ever seen the person, place or thing in\nquestion\u201d (citation omitted)). The truth of the premises\ncould then be established through independent evidence,\nand the factfinder would regard the expert\u2019s testimony to\nbe only as credible as the premises on which it was based.\n   An early example of this approach comes from the Eng-\nlish case of Beckwith v. Sydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170\nEng. Rep. 897 (K. B. 1807), where a party sought to prove\nthe seaworthiness of a ship, the Earl of Wycombe, by\ncalling as witnesses \u201cseveral eminent surveyors of ships\nwho had never seen the \u2018Earl of Wycombe.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The\nopposing party objected to the testimony because it relied\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\non facts that were not known to be true, but the judge\ndisagreed. Because the experts were \u201cpeculiarly ac-\nquainted\u201d with \u201ca matter of skill or science,\u201d the judge\nsaid, the \u201cjury might be assisted\u201d by their hypothetical\nopinion based on certain assumed facts. Id., at 117, 170 Eng.\nRep., at 897. The judge acknowledged the danger of the\njury\u2019s being unduly prejudiced by wrongly assuming the\ntruth of the hypothetical facts, but the judge noted that\nthe experts could be asked on cross-examination what\ntheir opinion of the ship\u2019s seaworthiness would be if differ-\nent hypothetical facts were assumed. If the party that had\ncalled the experts could not independently prove the truth\nof the premises they posited, then the experts\u2019 \u201copinion\nmight not go for much; but still it was admissible evi-\ndence.\u201d Ibid.\n   There is a long tradition of the use of hypothetical ques-\ntions in American courts. In 1887, for example, this Court\nindicated its approval of the following jury instruction:\n        \u201cAs to the questions, you must understand that they\n     are not evidence; they are mere statements to these\n     witnesses . . . and, upon the hypothesis or assumption\n     of these questions the witnesses are asked to give\n     their [opinion]. You must readily see that the value of\n     the answers to these questions depends largely, if not\n     wholly, upon the fact whether the statements made in\n     these questions are sustained by the proof. If the\n     statements in these questions are not supported by\n     the proof, then the answers to the questions are enti-\n     tled to no weight, because based upon false assump-\n     tions or statements of facts.\u201d Forsyth v. Doolittle, 120\n     U. S. 73, 77 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Modern rules of evidence continue to permit experts to\nexpress opinions based on facts about which they lack\npersonal knowledge, but these rules dispense with the\nneed for hypothetical questions. Under both the Illinois\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    15\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nand the Federal Rules of Evidence, an expert may base an\nopinion on facts that are \u201cmade known to the expert at or\nbefore the hearing,\u201d but such reliance does not constitute\nadmissible evidence of this underlying information. Ill.\nRule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703. Accordingly, in jury\ntrials, both Illinois and federal law generally bar an expert\nfrom disclosing such inadmissible evidence.2 In bench\ntrials, however, both the Illinois and the Federal Rules\nplace no restriction on the revelation of such information\nto the factfinder. When the judge sits as the trier of fact,\nit is presumed that the judge will understand the limited\nreason for the disclosure of the underlying inadmissible\ninformation and will not rely on that information for any\nimproper purpose. As we have noted, \u201c[i]n bench trials,\njudges routinely hear inadmissible evidence that they are\npresumed to ignore when making decisions.\u201d Harris v.\nRivera, 454 U.

Although the accom-\nplice\u2019s confession was clearly a testimonial statement, the\nCourt held that the jurors could hear it as long as they\nwere instructed to consider that confession not for its\ntruth, but only for the \u201cdistinctive and limited purpose\u201d of\ncomparing it to the defendant\u2019s confession, to see whether\nthe two were identical.

She testified to the\ntruth of the following matters: Cellmark was an accredited\nlab, App. 49; the ISP occasionally sent forensic samples to\nCellmark for DNA testing, ibid.; according to shipping\nmanifests admitted into evidence, the ISP lab sent vaginal\nswabs taken from the victim to Cellmark and later re-\nceived those swabs back from Cellmark, id., at 52\u201355; and,\nfinally, the Cellmark DNA profile matched a profile pro-\nduced by the ISP lab from a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood,\nid., at 55\u201356. Lambatos had personal knowledge of all\nof these matters, and therefore none of this testimony in-\nfringed petitioner\u2019s confrontation right.\n   Lambatos did not testify to the truth of any other matter\nconcerning Cellmark. She made no other reference to the\nCellmark report, which was not admitted into evidence\nand was not seen by the trier of fact. Nor did she testify to\nanything that was done at the Cellmark lab, and she did\nnot vouch for the quality of Cellmark\u2019s work.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n        17\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The principal argument advanced to show a Confronta-\ntion Clause violation concerns the phrase that Lambatos\nused when she referred to the DNA profile that the ISP\nlab received from Cellmark. This argument is developed\nmost fully in the dissenting opinion, and therefore we refer\nto the dissent\u2019s discussion of this issue.\n   In the view of the dissent, the following is the critical\nportion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony, with the particular words\nthat the dissent finds objectionable italicized:\n\n       \u201cQ Was there a computer match generated\n       of the male DNA profile found in semen\n       from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] to a male\n       DNA profile that had been identified as hav-\n       ing originated from Sandy Williams?\n\n       \u201cA Yes, there was.\u201d Post, at 7 (opinion of\n       KAGAN, J.) (quoting App. 56; emphasis\n       added).\n\n  According to the dissent, the italicized phrase violated\npetitioner\u2019s confrontation right because Lambatos lacked\npersonal knowledge that the profile produced by Cellmark\nwas based on the vaginal swabs taken from the victim,\nL. J. As the dissent acknowledges, there would have been\n\u201cnothing wrong with Lambatos\u2019s testifying that two DNA\nprofiles\u2014the one shown in the Cellmark report and the\none derived from Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched each other;\nthat was a straightforward application of Lambatos\u2019s\nexpertise.\u201d Post, at 12. Thus, if Lambatos\u2019 testimony had\nbeen slightly modified as follows, the dissent would see no\nproblem:\n\n       \u201cQ Was there a computer match generated\n       of the male DNA profile produced by\n18                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n          Cellmark found in semen from the vaginal\n          swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that\n          had been identified as having originated\n          from Sandy Williams?\n\n          \u201cA Yes, there was.\u201d3\n\n   The defect in this argument is that under Illinois law\n(like federal law) it is clear that the putatively offending\nphrase in Lambatos\u2019 testimony was not admissible for the\npurpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted\u2014i.e.,\nthat the matching DNA profile was \u201cfound in semen from\nthe vaginal swabs.\u201d Rather, that fact was a mere premise\nof the prosecutor\u2019s question, and Lambatos simply as-\nsumed that premise to be true when she gave her answer\nindicating that there was a match between the two DNA\nprofiles. There is no reason to think that the trier of fact\ntook Lambatos\u2019 answer as substantive evidence to estab-\nlish where the DNA profiles came from.\n   The dissent\u2019s argument would have force if petitioner\nhad elected to have a jury trial. In that event, there would\nhave been a danger of the jury\u2019s taking Lambatos\u2019 testi-\nmony as proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from\nthe sample obtained from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs.\nAbsent an evaluation of the risk of juror confusion and\ncareful jury instructions, the testimony could not have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  small difference between what Lambatos actually said on the\nstand and the slightly revised version that the dissent would find un-\nobjectionable shows that, despite the dissent\u2019s rhetoric, its narrow\nargument would have little practical effect in future cases. Prosecutors\nwould be allowed to do exactly what the prosecution did in this case so\nlong as their testifying experts\u2019 testimony was slightly modified along\nthe lines shown above. Following that course presumably would not\nconstitute a \u201cprosecutorial dodge,\u201d \u201csubterfuge,\u201d \u201cindirection,\u201d the \u201cneat\ntrick\u201d of \u201csneak[ing]\u201d in evidence, or the countenancing of constitutional\nviolations with \u201ca wink and a nod.\u201d See post, at 3, 16, 17, 12 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.).\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Were it not for that wording, the\nargument goes, the judge might have found that the pros-\necution failed to introduce sufficient admissible evidence\nto show that the Cellmark profile was derived from the\nsample taken from the victim, and the judge might have\ndisregarded the DNA evidence. This argument reflects a\nprofound lack of respect for the acumen of the trial judge.5\n   To begin, the dissent\u2019s argument finds no support in the\ntrial record. After defense counsel objected to Lambatos\u2019\ntestimony, the prosecutor made clear that she was asking\nLambatos only about \u201cher own testing based on [DNA]\ninformation\u201d that she had received from Cellmark. App.\n56. Recognizing that Lambatos\u2019 testimony would carry\nweight only if the underlying premises could be estab-\nlished, the judge noted that \u201cthe issue is . . . what weight\ndo you give the test [performed by Lambatos], not do you\nexclude it.\u201d Id., at 94. This echoes the old statement in\nBeckwith that an expert\u2019s opinion based on disputed prem-\nises \u201cmight not go for much; but still it [is] admissible\nevidence.\u201d 1 Camp., at 117, 170 Eng. Rep., at 897. Both\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We do not suggest that the Confrontation Clause applies differently\n\ndepending on the identity of the factfinder. Cf. post, at 14\u201315 (opinion\nof KAGAN, J.). Instead, our point is that the identity of the factfinder\nmakes a big difference in evaluating the likelihood that the factfinder\nmistakenly based its decision on inadmissible evidence.\n  5 See post, at 14 (opinion of KAGAN, J.) (\u201cI do not doubt that a judge\n\ntypically will do better than a jury in excluding such inadmissible\nevidence from his decisionmaking process. Perhaps the judge did so\nhere\u201d (emphasis added)).\n20                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme\nCourt viewed the record in this way, and we see no ground\nfor disagreement.6\n   Second, it is extraordinarily unlikely that any trial\njudge would be confused in the way that the dissent posits.\nThat Lambatos was not competent to testify to the chain\nof custody of the sample taken from the victim was a point\nthat any trial judge or attorney would immediately under-\nstand. Lambatos, after all, had absolutely nothing to do\nwith the collection of the sample from the victim, its sub-\nsequent handling or preservation by the police in Illinois,\nor its shipment to and receipt by Cellmark. No trial judge\nwould take Lambatos\u2019 testimony as furnishing \u201cthe miss-\ning link\u201d in the State\u2019s evidence regarding the identity of\nthe sample that Cellmark tested. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.).\n   Third, the admissible evidence left little room for argu-\nment that the sample tested by Cellmark came from any\nsource other than the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs.7 This is so\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent finds evidence of the trial judge\u2019s confusion in his\n\nstatement that petitioner is \u201c \u2018the guy whose DNA, according to the\nevidence from the experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s\nvagina.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 14 (emphasis added). The dissent interprets the\nphrase \u201caccording to the evidence from the experts\u201d as a reference to\nwhat one expert, Lambatos, said about the origin of the sample that\nCellmark tested. In context, however, the judge\u2019s statement is best\nunderstood as attributing to Lambatos nothing more than the conclu-\nsion that there was a match between the two DNA profiles that were\ncompared. The foundational facts, that one of the profiles came from\nthe defendant and that the other came from \u201c \u2018the semen recovered from\nthe victim\u2019s vagina,\u2019 \u201d were established not by expert testimony but by\nordinary chain-of-custody evidence.\n   7 Our point is not that admissible evidence regarding the identity of\n\nthe sample that Cellmark tested excuses the admission of testimonial\nhearsay on this matter. Compare post, at 5\u20136 (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment), with post, at 14 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Rather, our point\nis that, because there was substantial (albeit circumstantial) evidence\non this matter, there is no reason to infer that the trier of fact must\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

If any other items that\nmight have contained Williams\u2019 DNA had been sent\nto Cellmark or were otherwise in Cellmark\u2019s possession,\nthere would have been a chance of a mix-up or of cross-\ncontamination. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third\nJudicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. 52, 80 (2009) (ALITO,\nJ., concurring). But there is absolutely nothing to suggest\nthat Cellmark had any such items. Thus, the fact that the\nCellmark profile matched Williams\u2014the very man whom\nthe victim identified in a lineup and at trial as her at-\ntacker\u2014was itself striking confirmation that the sample\nthat Cellmark tested was the sample taken from the victim\u2019s\nvaginal swabs. For these reasons, it is fanciful to suggest\nthat the trial judge took Lambatos\u2019 testimony as providing\ncritical chain-of-custody evidence.\n                                  C\n  Other than the phrase that Lambatos used in referring\nto the Cellmark profile, no specific passage in the trial\nrecord has been identified as violating the Confrontation\nClause, but it is nevertheless suggested that the State\nsomehow introduced \u201cthe substance of Cellmark\u2019s report\ninto evidence.\u201d Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). The\nmain impetus for this argument appears to be the (errone-\nous) view that unless the substance of the report was\nsneaked in, there would be insufficient evidence in the\nrecord on two critical points: first, that the Cellmark\nprofile was based on the semen in the victim\u2019s vaginal\nswabs and, second, that Cellmark\u2019s procedures were reli-\nable. This argument is both legally irrelevant for present\npurposes and factually incorrect.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhave taken Lambatos\u2019 statement as providing \u201cthe missing link.\u201d\n\n                                                               \n\n22                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   As to legal relevance, the question before us is whether\npetitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was\nviolated, not whether the State offered sufficient founda-\ntional evidence to support the admission of Lambatos\u2019\nopinion about the DNA match. In order to prove these\nunderlying facts, the prosecution relied on circumstantial\nevidence, and the Illinois courts found that this evidence\nwas sufficient to satisfy state-law requirements regarding\nproof of foundational facts. See 385 Ill. App. 3d, at 366\u2013\n368, 895 N. E. 2d, at 967\u2013968; 238 Ill. 2d, at 138, 939 N. E.\n2d, at 275. We cannot review that interpretation and\napplication of Illinois law. Thus, even if the record did not\ncontain any evidence that could rationally support a find-\ning that Cellmark produced a scientifically reliable DNA\nprofile based on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab, that would not estab-\nlish a Confrontation Clause violation. If there were no\nproof that Cellmark produced an accurate profile based on\nthat sample, Lambatos\u2019 testimony regarding the match\nwould be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause, as\ninterpreted in Crawford, does not bar the admission of\nirrelevant evidence, only testimonial statements by de-\nclarants who are not subject to cross-examination.8\n   It is not correct, however, that the trial record lacks\nadmissible evidence with respect to the source of the sam-\nple that Cellmark tested or the reliability of the Cell-\nmark profile. As to the source of the sample, the State\noffered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, namely,\nthe testimony of the physician who obtained the vaginal\nswabs, the testimony of the police employees who handled\nand kept custody of that evidence until it was sent to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Applying the Due Process Clause, we have held that a federal court\n\nmay determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the\nexistence of all the elements needed for conviction for a state offense.\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 314 (1979), but petitioner has not\nraised a due process claim. And in any event, L. J.\u2019s identification of\npetitioner as her assailant would be sufficient to defeat any such claim.\n                       Cite as: 567 U.

In addition, as already discussed,\nthe match between the Cellmark profile and petitioner\u2019s\nprofile was itself telling confirmation that the Cellmark\nprofile was deduced from the semen on the vaginal swabs.\n   This match also provided strong circumstantial evidence\nregarding the reliability of Cellmark\u2019s work. Assuming (for\nthe reasons discussed above) that the Cellmark profile\nwas based on the semen on the vaginal swabs, how could\nshoddy or dishonest work in the Cellmark lab9 have re-\nsulted in the production of a DNA profile that just so\nhappened to match petitioner\u2019s? If the semen found on the\nvaginal swabs was not petitioner\u2019s and thus had an en-\ntirely different DNA profile, how could sloppy work in the\nCellmark lab have transformed that entirely different\nprofile into one that matched petitioner\u2019s? And without\naccess to any other sample of petitioner\u2019s DNA (and recall\nthat petitioner was not even under suspicion at this time),\nhow could a dishonest lab technician have substituted pe-\ntitioner\u2019s DNA profile? Under the circumstances of this\ncase, it was surely permissible for the trier of fact to infer\nthat the odds of any of this were exceedingly low.\n   This analysis reveals that much of the dissent\u2019s argu-\nment rests on a very clear error. The dissent argues that\nLambatos\u2019 testimony could be \u201ctrue\u201d only if the predicate\nfacts asserted in the Cellmark report were true, and there-\nfore Lambatos\u2019 reference to the report must have been\nused for the purpose of proving the truth of those facts.\nSee post, at 10\u201311. But the truth of Lambatos\u2019 testimony,\nproperly understood, was not dependent on the truth of\nany predicate facts. Lambatos testified that two DNA\nprofiles matched.

Of course, Lamba-\ntos\u2019 opinion would have lacked probative value if the pros-\necution had not introduced other evidence to establish the\nprovenance of the profiles, but that has nothing to do with\nthe truth of her testimony.\n   The dissent is similarly mistaken in its contention that\nthe Cellmark report \u201cwas offered for its truth because that\nis all such \u2018basis evidence\u2019 can be offered for.\u201d Post, at 13;\nsee also post, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\u201c[S]tatements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s\nopinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay\npurpose\u201d).

The dissent concedes\nthat \u201cthe trial judge might have ignored Lambatos\u2019s\nstatement about the Cellmark report,\u201d but nonetheless\nmaintains that \u201cthe admission of that statement violated\nthe Confrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put\nit aside.\u201d Post, at 15, n. 2. But in a bench trial, it is not\nnecessary for the judge to stop and make a formal state-\nment on the record regarding the limited reason for which\nthe testimony is admitted.

Thus, just as in Street, the report was not to\nbe considered for its truth but only for the \u201cdistinctive and\nlimited purpose\u201d of seeing whether it matched something\nelse. 471 U. S., at 417. The relevance of the match was\nthen established by independent circumstantial evidence\nshowing that the Cellmark report was based on a forensic\nsample taken from the scene of the crime.\n   Our conclusion will not open the door for the kind of\nabuses suggested by some of petitioner\u2019s amici and the\ndissent. See post, at 10\u201311; Brief for Richard D. Friedman\nas Amicus Curiae 20\u201321. In the hypothetical situations\nposited, an expert expresses an opinion based on factual\npremises not supported by any admissible evidence, and\nmay also reveal the out-of-court statements on which the\nexpert relied.11 There are at least four safeguards to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Both JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE KAGAN quote statements in D.\n\nKaye, D. Bernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence\n\u00a74.10.1, pp. 196\u2013197 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter New Wigmore), that are\ncritical of the theory that an expert, without violating the Confronta-\ntion Clause, may express an opinion that is based on testimonial\nhearsay and may, in some circumstances, disclose that testimonial\nhearsay to the trier of fact. The principal basis for this criticism seems\nto be the fear that juries, even if given limiting instructions, will view\nthe disclosed hearsay as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted.\nSee id., at 196, n. 36 (referring reader to the more detailed discussion in\nMnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause After Craw-\nford v. Washington, 15 J. L. & Pol\u2019y 791 (2007)); New Wigmore 197,\nand n. 39 (citing jury cases); Mnookin, supra, at 802\u2013804, 811\u2013813.\nThis argument plainly has no application in a case like this one, in\nwhich a judge sits as the trier of fact. In the 2012 Supplement of The\nNew Wigmore, the authors discuss the present case and criticize the\nreasoning of the Illinois courts as follows:\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   27\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nprevent such abuses. First, trial courts can screen out\nexperts who would act as mere conduits for hearsay by\nstrictly enforcing the requirement that experts display\nsome genuine \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized\nknowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed. Rule\nEvid. 702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded\nfrom disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury. See Fed.\nRule Evid. 703; People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\u2013176,\n604 N. E. 2d 294, 310\u2013311 (1992). Third, if such evidence\nis disclosed, the trial judges may and, under most circum-\nstances, must, instruct the jury that out-of-court state-\nments cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an\nexpert\u2019s opinion is only as good as the independent evi-\ndence that establishes its underlying premises. See Fed.\nRules Evid. 105, 703; People v. Scott, 148 Ill. 2d 479, 527\u2013\n528, 594 N. E. 2d 217, 236\u2013237 (1992). And fourth, if the\nprosecution cannot muster any independent admissible\nevidence to prove the foundational facts that are essential\nto the relevance of the expert\u2019s testimony, then the ex-\npert\u2019s testimony cannot be given any weight by the trier of\nfact.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  \u201cThe problem with [the not-for-the-truth-of-the-matter argument\n  accepted by the Illinois courts] is that Lambatos had to rely on the\n  truth of the statements in the Cellmark report to reach her own con-\n  clusion. The claim that evidence that the jury must credit in order to\n  credit the conclusion of the expert is introduced for something other\n  than its truth is sheer fiction.\u201d New Wigmore \u00a74.11.6, at 24 (2012\n  Supp.) (emphasis added).\n  This discussion is flawed. It overlooks the fact that there was no jury\nin this case, and as we have explained, the trier of fact did not have to\nrely on any testimonial hearsay in order to find that Lambatos\u2019 testi-\nmony about the DNA match was supported by adequate foundational\nevidence and was thus probative.\n  12 Our discussion of the first ground for our decision cannot conclude\n\nwithout commenting on the Kocak case, which dramatically appears at\nthe beginning of the dissent. In that case, a Cellmark lab analyst\n28                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Even if the Cellmark report had been introduced for its\ntruth, we would nevertheless conclude that there was no\nConfrontation Clause violation. The Confrontation Clause\nrefers to testimony by \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused.\nBoth the noted evidence scholar James Henry Wigmore\nand Justice Harlan interpreted the Clause in a strictly\nliteral sense as referring solely to persons who testify in\ncourt, but we have not adopted this narrow view. It has\nbeen said that \u201c[t]he difficulty with the Wigmore-Harlan\nview in its purest form is its tension with much of the\napparent history surrounding the evolution of the right of\nconfrontation at common law.\u201d White v. Illinois, 502 U. S.\n346, 360 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring). \u201c[T]he principal\nevil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed,\u201d the\nCourt concluded in Crawford, \u201cwas the civil-law mode of\ncriminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte\nexaminations as evidence against the accused.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 50. \u201c[I]n England, pretrial examinations of suspects\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrealized while testifying at a pretrial hearing that there was an error in\nthe lab\u2019s report and that the DNA profile attributed to the accused was\nactually that of the victim. The lesson of this cautionary tale is nothing\nmore than the truism that it is possible for an apparently incriminating\nDNA profile to be mistakenly attributed to an accused. But requiring\nthat the lab analyst or analysts who produced the DNA profile be called\nas prosecution witnesses is neither sufficient nor necessary to prevent\nsuch errors. Since samples may be mixed up or contaminated at many\npoints along the way from a crime scene to the lab, calling one or more\nlab analysts will not necessarily catch all such mistakes. For example,\na mistake might be made by a clerical employee responsible for receiv-\ning shipments of samples and then providing them to the lab\u2019s techni-\ncians. What is needed is for the trier of fact to make sure that the\nevidence, whether direct or circumstantial, rules out the possibility of\nsuch mistakes at every step along the way. And in the usual course of\nauthentication, defense counsel will have access to sufficient infor-\nmation to inquire into, question, or challenge the procedures used by a\nlaboratory if this seems to be a prudent and productive strategy.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Crawford, supra, at 43). The\nCourt has thus interpreted the Confrontation Clause as\nprohibiting modern-day practices that are tantamount to\nthe abuses that gave rise to the recognition of the confron-\ntation right. But any further expansion would strain the\nconstitutional text.\n   The abuses that the Court has identified as prompting\nthe adoption of the Confrontation Clause shared the fol-\nlowing two characteristics: (a) they involved out-of-court\nstatements having the primary purpose of accusing a\ntargeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct and\n(b) they involved formalized statements such as affidavits,\ndepositions, prior testimony, or confessions. In all but\none of the post-Crawford cases13 in which a Confrontation\nClause violation has been found, both of these characteris-\ntics were present. See Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at 308 (slip\nop., at 3\u20134) (certified lab report having purpose of showing\nthat defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level exceeded legal limit);\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 308 (certified lab report\nhaving purpose of showing that substance connected to\ndefendant contained cocaine); Crawford, supra, at 38\n(custodial statement made after Miranda warnings that\nshifted blame from declarant to accused).14 The one excep-\ntion occurred in Hammon v. Indiana, 547 U. S. 813, 829\u2013\n832 (2006), which was decided together with Davis v.\nWashington, but in Hammon and every other post-\nCrawford case in which the Court has found a violation of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Experience might yet show that the holdings in those cases should\n\nbe reconsidered for the reasons, among others, expressed in the dis-\nsents the decisions produced. Those decisions are not challenged in this\ncase and are to be deemed binding precedents, but they can and should\nbe distinguished on the facts here.\n  14 With respect to Crawford, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 840 (THOMAS, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n30                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe confrontation right, the statement at issue had the\nprimary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\n                               B\n   In Hammon, the one case in which an informal state-\nment was held to violate the Confrontation Clause, we\nconsidered statements elicited in the course of police in-\nterrogation. We held that a statement does not fall\nwithin the ambit of the Clause when it is made \u201cunder\ncircumstances objectively indicating that the primary\npurpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance\nto meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d 547 U. S., at 822. In\nBryant, another police-interrogation case, we explained\nthat a person who makes a statement to resolve an ongo-\ning emergency is not acting like a trial witness because\nthe declarant\u2019s purpose is not to provide a solemn declara-\ntion for use at trial, but to bring an end to an ongoing\nthreat. See 562 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 14). We\nnoted that \u201cthe prospect of fabrication . . . is presumably\nsignificantly diminished\u201d when a statement is made under\nsuch circumstances, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) and that\nreliability is a salient characteristic of a statement that\nfalls outside the reach of the Confrontation Clause, id., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 14\u201315). We emphasized that if a\nstatement is not made for \u201cthe primary purpose of creating\nan out-of-court substitute for trial testimony,\u201d its admissi-\nbility \u201cis the concern of state and federal rules of evidence,\nnot the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n11\u201312).\n   In Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, the Court held that\nthe particular forensic reports at issue qualified as testi-\nmonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all\nforensic reports fall into the same category.

There was nothing resembling\nan ongoing emergency, as the suspects in both cases had\nalready been captured, and the tests in question were\nrelatively simple and can generally be performed by a\nsingle analyst. In addition, the technicians who prepared\nthe reports must have realized that their contents (which\nreported an elevated blood-alcohol level and the presence\nof an illegal drug) would be incriminating.\n                             C\n   The Cellmark report is very different. It plainly was not\nprepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted\nindividual. In identifying the primary purpose of an out-\nof-court statement, we apply an objective test. Bryant, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We look for the primary\npurpose that a reasonable person would have ascribed to\nthe statement, taking into account all of the surrounding\ncircumstances. Ibid.\n   Here, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report,\nviewed objectively, was not to accuse petitioner or to cre-\nate evidence for use at trial. When the ISP lab sent the\nsample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a\ndangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain\nevidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in\ncustody nor under suspicion at that time. Similarly, no\none at Cellmark could have possibly known that the\nprofile that it produced would turn out to inculpate\npetitioner\u2014or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA\nprofile was in a law enforcement database. Under these\ncircumstances, there was no \u201cprospect of fabrication\u201d and\nno incentive to produce anything other than a scientifi-\ncally sound and reliable profile. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   The situation in which the Cellmark technicians found\nthemselves was by no means unique. When lab techni-\ncians are asked to work on the production of a DNA pro-\nfile, they often have no idea what the consequences of\n32                 WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ntheir work will be. In some cases, a DNA profile may\nprovide powerful incriminating evidence against a person\nwho is identified either before or after the profile is com-\npleted. But in others, the primary effect of the profile is\nto exonerate a suspect who has been charged or is under\ninvestigation. The technicians who prepare a DNA profile\ngenerally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out\nto be incriminating or exonerating\u2014or both.\n  It is also significant that in many labs, numerous tech-\nnicians work on each DNA profile. See Brief for New York\nCounty District Attorney\u2019s Office et al. as Amici Curiae 6\n(New York lab uses at least 12 technicians for each case);\nPeople v. Johnson, 389 Ill. App. 3d 618, 627, 906 N. E. 2d\n70, 79 (2009) (\u201c[A]pproximately 10 Cellmark analysts were\ninvolved in the laboratory work in this case\u201d). When the\nwork of a lab is divided up in such a way, it is likely that\nthe sole purpose of each technician is simply to perform\nhis or her task in accordance with accepted procedures.\n  Finally, the knowledge that defects in a DNA profile\nmay often be detected from the profile itself provides a\nfurther safeguard. In this case, for example, Lambatos\ntestified that she would have been able to tell from the\nprofile if the sample used by Cellmark had been degraded\nprior to testing. As noted above, moreover, there is no real\nchance that \u201csample contamination, sample switching,\nmislabeling, [or] fraud\u201d could have led Cellmark to pro-\nduce a DNA profile that falsely matched petitioner. Post,\nat 21 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). At the time of the testing,\npetitioner had not yet been identified as a suspect, and\nthere is no suggestion that anyone at Cellmark had a\nsample of his DNA to swap in by malice or mistake. And\ngiven the complexity of the DNA molecule, it is inconceiv-\nable that shoddy lab work would somehow produce a DNA\nprofile that just so happened to have the precise genetic\nmakeup of petitioner, who just so happened to be picked\nout of a lineup by the victim.

S. 36 (2004)? Because I believe the\nquestion difficult, important, and not squarely addressed\neither today or in our earlier opinions, and because I\nbelieve additional briefing would help us find a proper,\ngenerally applicable answer, I would set this case for\nreargument. In the absence of doing so, I adhere to the\ndissenting views set forth in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu-\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011). I also join the plurality\u2019s opinion.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case is another in our series involving the inter-\nsection of the Confrontation Clause and expert testimony.\nBefore trial, the prosecution\u2019s expert, Sandra Lambatos,\nreceived a copy of a report prepared by Cellmark Diagnos-\ntics Laboratory. That report reflected the fact that\nCellmark technicians had received material from a vaginal\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nswab taken from the crime victim, had identified semen in\nthat material, and had derived a profile of the male DNA\nthat the semen contained. Lambatos then entered that\nprofile into an Illinois State Police Crime Laboratory\ncomputerized database, which contained, among many\nother DNA profiles, a profile derived by the crime labora-\ntory from Williams\u2019 blood (taken at an earlier time). The\ncomputer she was using showed that the two profiles\nmatched. Lambatos then confirmed the match.\n   Later, Lambatos testified at trial, where the prosecutor\nasked her three relevant questions. First, the prosecutor\nasked whether there was \u201ca computer match generated of\nthe male DNA profile [derived by Cellmark] found in [the]\nsemen from the vaginal swabs . . . to [the] male DNA\nprofile [found in the database] that had been identified as\nhaving originated from Sandy Williams\u201d? App. 56. Since\nthe computer had shown such a match, Lambatos an-\nswered affirmatively. Ibid.\n   Second, the prosecutor asked whether Lambatos had in-\ndependently \u201ccompare[d the DNA profile that Cellmark\nhad derived from] the semen that had been identified . . .\nfrom the vaginal swabs of [the victim] to the male DNA\nprofile [found in the database] that had been [derived] . . .\nfrom the blood of Sandy Williams.\u201d Ibid. Lambatos again\nanswered affirmatively. Ibid.\n   Third, the prosecutor asked whether, in Lambatos\u2019 ex-\npert opinion, the DNA profile derived from the semen\nidentified in the vaginal swabs of the victim was \u201ca match\nto Sandy Williams.\u201d Id., at 58. Lambatos again answered\naffirmatively. Ibid.\n   The Confrontation Clause problem lies in the fact that\nLambatos did not have personal knowledge that the male\nDNA profile that Cellmark said was derived from the\ncrime victim\u2019s vaginal swab sample was in fact correctly\nderived from that sample. And no Cellmark expert testi-\nfied that it was true. Rather, she simply relied for her\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\nknowledge of the fact upon Cellmark\u2019s report. And the\ndefendant Williams had no opportunity to cross-examine\nthe individual or individuals who produced that report.\n   In its first conclusion, the plurality explains why it finds\nthat admission of Lambatos\u2019 testimony nonetheless did not\nviolate the Confrontation Clause. That Clause concerns\nout-of-court statements admitted for their truth. Ante,\nat 15\u201316. Lambatos\u2019 testimony did not introduce the\nCellmark report (which other circumstantial evidence\nsupported) for its truth. Ante, at 16\u201321. Rather, Lam-\nbatos used the Cellmark report only to indicate the under-\nlying factual information upon which she based her\nindependent expert opinion. Ibid. Under well-established\nprinciples of evidence, experts may rely on otherwise\ninadmissible out-of-court statements as a basis for forming\nan expert opinion if they are of a kind that experts in the\nfield normally rely upon. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Ill.\nRule Evid. 703. Nor need the prosecution enter those out-\nof-court statements into evidence for their truth. That,\nthe Illinois courts held, is just what took place here. Ante,\nat 9\u201310.\n   The dissent would abandon this well-established rule.\nIt would not permit Lambatos to offer an expert opinion\nin reliance on the Cellmark report unless the prosecution\nalso produces one or more experts who wrote or otherwise\nproduced the report. I am willing to accept the dissent\u2019s\ncharacterization of the present rule as artificial, see post,\nat 15\u201317 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), but I am not certain that\nthe dissent has produced a workable alternative, see\nBullcoming, supra, at ___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 7) (expressing similar view).\n   Once one abandons the traditional rule, there would\nseem often to be no logical stopping place between requir-\ning the prosecution to call as a witness one of the labora-\ntory experts who worked on the matter and requiring the\nprosecution to call all of the laboratory experts who did so.\n4                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nExperts\u2014especially laboratory experts\u2014regularly rely on\nthe technical statements and results of other experts to\nform their own opinions. The reality of the matter is that\nthe introduction of a laboratory report involves layer upon\nlayer of technical statements (express or implied) made by\none expert and relied upon by another. Hence my general\nquestion: How does the Confrontation Clause apply to\ncrime laboratory reports and underlying technical state-\nments made by laboratory technicians?\n                             B\n   The general question is not easy to answer. The Cali-\nfornia case described at the outset of the dissenting opin-\nion helps to illustrate the difficulty. In that example,\nCellmark, the very laboratory involved in this case, tested\na DNA sample taken from the crime scene. A laboratory\nanalyst, relying upon a report the laboratory had prepared,\ninitially stated (at a pretrial hearing about admissibil-\nity) that the laboratory had found that the crime-scene\nDNA sample matched a sample of the defendant\u2019s DNA.\nBut during the hearing and after reviewing the labor-\natory\u2019s notes, the laboratory analyst realized that the\nwritten report was mistaken. In fact, the testing showed\nonly that the crime-scene DNA matched a sample of the\nvictim\u2019s DNA, not the defendant\u2019s DNA. At some point\nduring the writing of the report, someone, perhaps the\ntestifying analyst herself, must have misread the proper\noriginal sample labeling. Upon discovering the error, the\nanalyst corrected her testimony.\n   The example is useful, not simply because as adapted\nit might show the importance of cross-examination (an\nimportance no one doubts), but also because it can reveal\nthe nature of the more general question before us. When\nthe laboratory in the example received the DNA samples,\nit labeled them properly. The laboratory\u2019s final report\nmixed up the labels. Any one of many different techni-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncians could be responsible for an error like that. And the\ntestifying analyst might not have reviewed the underlying\nnotes and caught the error during direct examination (or\nfor that matter, during cross-examination).\n   Adapting the example slightly, assume that the admis-\nsibility of the initial laboratory report into trial had been\ndirectly at issue. Who should the prosecution have had to\ncall to testify? Only the analyst who signed the report\nnoting the match? What if the analyst who made the\nmatch knew nothing about either the laboratory\u2019s underly-\ning procedures or the specific tests run in the particular\ncase? Should the prosecution then have had to call all\npotentially involved laboratory technicians to testify? Six\nto twelve or more technicians could have been involved.\n(See Appendix, infra, which lists typically relevant labora-\ntory procedures.) Some or all of the words spoken or\nwritten by each technician out of court might well have\nconstituted relevant statements offered for their truth and\nreasonably relied on by a supervisor or analyst writing\nthe laboratory report. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s amici argue\nthat the technicians at each stage of the process should\nbe subject to cross-examination. See Brief for Innocence\nNetwork as Amicus Curiae 13\u201323 (hereinafter Innocence\nNetwork Brief).\n   And as is true of many hearsay statements that fall\nwithin any of the 20 or more hearsay exceptions, cross-\nexamination could sometimes significantly help to elicit\nthe truth. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803 (listing 24 hearsay\nexceptions). The Confrontation Clause as interpreted in\nCrawford recognizes, as a limitation upon a pure \u201ctesti-\nmonial statement\u201d requirement, circumstances where the\ndefendant had an adequate \u201cprior opportunity to cross-\nexamine.\u201d 541 U. S., at 59. To what extent might the\n\u201ctestimonial statements\u201d requirement embody one or more\n(or modified versions) of these traditional hearsay excep-\ntions as well?\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\n   Lower courts and treatise writers have recognized the\nproblem. And they have come up with a variety of solu-\ntions. The New Wigmore, for example, lists several non-\nexclusive approaches to when testifying experts may rely\non testing results or reports by nontestifying experts (i.e.,\nDNA technicians or analysts), including: (1) \u201cthe dominant\napproach,\u201d which is simply to determine the need to testify\nby looking \u201cthe quality of the nontestifying expert\u2019s report,\nthe testifying expert\u2019s involvement in the process, and the\nconsequent ability of the testifying expert to use inde-\npendent judgment and interpretive skill\u201d; (2) permitting \u201ca\nsubstitute expert to testify about forensic science results\nonly when the first expert is unavailable\u201d (irrespective of\nthe lack of opportunity to cross-examine the first expert,\ncf. Crawford, supra, at 59); (3) permitting \u201ca substitute\nexpert\u201d to testify if \u201cthe original test was documented in a\nthorough way that permits the substitute expert to evalu-\nate, assess, and interpret it\u201d; (4) permitting a DNA analyst\nto introduce DNA test results at trial without having\n\u201cpersonally perform[ed] every specific aspect of each DNA\ntest in question, provided the analyst was present during\nthe critical stages of the test, is familiar with the process\nand the laboratory protocol involved, reviews the results\nin proximity to the test, and either initials or signs the\nfinal report outlining the results\u201d; (5) permitting the in-\ntroduction of a crime laboratory DNA report without the\ntestimony of a technician where the \u201ctesting in its pre-\nliminary stages\u201d only \u201crequires the technician simply to\nperform largely mechanical or ministerial tasks . . . absent\nsome reason to believe there was error or falsification\u201d;\nand (6) permitting introduction of the report without\nrequiring the technicians to testify where there is a show-\ning of \u201cgenuine unavailability.\u201d See D. Kaye, D. Bern-\nstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence,\n\u00a7\u00a74.10.2, 4.10.3, pp. 202, 204, 206 (2d ed. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks and footnote omitted); id., \u00a74.11.6, at 24\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\n(Supp. 2012).\n   Some of these approaches seem more readily compatible\nwith Crawford than others. Some seem more easily con-\nsidered by a rules committee (or by state courts) than by\nthis Court. Nonetheless, all assume some kind of Craw-\nford boundary\u2014some kind of limitation upon the scope of\nits application\u2014though they reflect different views as to\njust how and when that might be done.\n   Answering the underlying general question just dis-\ncussed, and doing so soon, is important. Trial judges in\nboth federal and state courts apply and interpret hearsay\nrules as part of their daily trial work. The trial of criminal\ncases makes up a large portion of that work. And labora-\ntory reports frequently constitute a portion of the evidence\nin ordinary criminal trials. Obviously, judges, prosecu-\ntors, and defense lawyers have to know, in as definitive a\nform as possible, what the Constitution requires so that\nthey can try their cases accordingly.\n   The several different opinions filed today embody sev-\neral serious, but different, approaches to the difficult gen-\neral question. Yet none fully deals with the underlying\nquestion as to how, after Crawford, Confrontation Clause\n\u201ctestimonial statement\u201d requirements apply to crime lab-\noratory reports. Nor can I find a general answer in\nMelendez-Diaz or Bullcoming. While, as a matter of pure\nlogic, one might use those cases to answer a narrowed\nversion of the question presented here, see post, at 7\u20138\n(KAGAN, J., dissenting), those cases do not fully con-\nsider the broader evidentiary problem presented. I conse-\nquently find the dissent\u2019s response, \u201cBeen there, done\nthat,\u201d unsatisfactory. See post, at 21.\n   Under these circumstances, I would have this case re-\nargued. I would request the parties and amici to focus\nspecifically upon the broader \u201climits\u201d question. And I\nwould permit them to discuss, not only the possible impli-\ncations of our earlier post-Crawford opinions, but also any\n8                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nnecessary modifications of statements made in the opin-\nions of those earlier cases.\n                              II\n   In the absence of reargument, I adhere to the dissenting\nview set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, under\nwhich the Cellmark report would not be considered \u201ctes-\ntimonial\u201d and barred by the Confrontation Clause. See\nalso ante, at 28\u201333 (setting forth similar conclusion). That\nview understands the Confrontation Clause as interpreted\nin Crawford to bar the admission of \u201c[t]estimonial\u201d state-\nments made out of court unless the declarant is unavail-\nable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-\nexamine. 541 U. S., at 59 (emphasis added). It also\nunderstands the word \u201ctestimonial\u201d as having outer limits\nand Crawford as describing a constitutional heartland.\nAnd that view would leave the States with constitutional\nleeway to maintain traditional expert testimony rules as\nwell as hearsay exceptions where there are strong reasons\nfor doing so and Crawford\u2019s basic rationale does not apply.\n   In particular, the States could create an exception that\npresumptively would allow introduction of DNA reports\nfrom accredited crime laboratories. The defendant would\nremain free to call laboratory technicians as witnesses.\nWere there significant reason to question a laboratory\u2019s\ntechnical competence or its neutrality, the presumptive\nexception would disappear, thereby requiring the prosecu-\ntion to produce any relevant technical witnesses. Such\nan exception would lie outside Crawford\u2019s constitutional\nlimits.\n   Consider the report before us. Cellmark\u2019s DNA report\nembodies technical or professional data, observations, and\njudgments; the employees who contributed to the report\u2019s\nfindings were professional analysts working on technical\nmatters at a certified laboratory; and the employees oper-\nated behind a veil of ignorance that likely prevented them\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nfrom knowing the identity of the defendant in this case.\nStatements of this kind fall within a hearsay exception\nthat has constituted an important part of the law of evi-\ndence for decades. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) (\u201cRecords of\nRegularly Conducted Activity\u201d); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence\n\u00a7\u00a71517\u20131533, pp. 1878\u20131899 (1904) (\u201cRegular Entries\u201d).\nAnd for somewhat similar reasons, I believe that such\nstatements also presumptively fall outside the category of\n\u201ctestimonial\u201d statements that the Confrontation Clause\nmakes inadmissible.\n   As the plurality points out, ante, at 28\u201333, the introduc-\ntion of statements of this kind does not risk creating\nthe \u201cprincipal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was\ndirected.\u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 50. That evil consists of\nthe pre-Constitution practice of using \u201cex parte examina-\ntions as evidence against the accused.\u201d Ibid. Sir Walter\nRaleigh\u2019s case illustrates the point. State authorities\nquestioned Lord Cobham, the key witness against Raleigh,\noutside his presence. They then used those testimonial\nstatements in court against Raleigh. And when Raleigh\nasked to face and to challenge his accuser, he was denied\nthat opportunity. See id., at 44.\n   The Confrontation Clause prohibits the use of this kind\nof evidence because allowing it would deprive a defendant\nof the ability to cross-examine the witness. Id., at 61\u201362;\nMattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 242\u2013243 (1895).\nThat deprivation would prevent a defendant from con-\nfronting the witness. And it would thereby prevent a\ndefendant from probing the witness\u2019 perception, memory,\nnarration, and sincerity. See, e.g., 2 K. Broun et al.,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7245, p. 125 (6th ed. 2006);\nE. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof Under the Anglo-\nAmerican System of Litigation 119\u2013127 (1956); 30 C.\nWright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a76324, pp. 44\u201349 (1997); see also M. Hale, History of the\nCommon Law of England 258 (1713) (explaining virtues of\n10                 WILLIAMS v.

But the need for\ncross-examination is considerably diminished when the\nout-of-court statement was made by an accredited labora-\ntory employee operating at a remove from the investiga-\ntion in the ordinary course of professional work.\n   For one thing, as the hearsay exception itself reflects,\nalternative features of such situations help to guarantee\nits accuracy. An accredited laboratory must satisfy well-\nestablished professional guidelines that seek to ensure the\nscientific reliability of the laboratory\u2019s results. App. 59\u2013\n60, 74, 86\u201387; see Brief for National District Attorneys\nAssn. et al. as Amici Curiae 25, n. 5 (hereinafter NDAA\nBrief) (noting that the standards date back 30 years);\nGiannelli, Regulating Crime Laboratories: The Impact of\nDNA Evidence, 15 J. L. & Pol\u2019y 59, 72\u201376 (2007). For\nexample, forensic DNA testing laboratories permitted to\naccess the FBI\u2019s Combined DNA Index System must\nadhere to standards governing, among other things, the\norganization and management of the laboratory; educa-\ntion, training, and experience requirements for laboratory\npersonnel; the laboratory\u2019s physical facilities and security\nmeasures; control of physical evidence; validation of test-\ning methodologies; procedures for analyzing samples,\nincluding the reagents and controls that are used in the\ntesting process; equipment calibration and maintenance;\ndocumentation of the process used to test each sample\nhandled by the laboratory; technical and administrative\nreview of every case file; proficiency testing of laboratory;\npersonnel; corrective action that addresses any discrepan-\ncies in proficiency tests and casework analysis; internal\nand external audits of the laboratory; environmental\nhealth and safety; and outsourcing of testing to vendor\nlaboratories.

It is not difficult to find instances in\nwhich laboratory procedures have been abused. See, e.g.,\nInnocence Network Brief 6\u201311; App. to Brief for Public\nDefender Service for the District of Columbia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 1a\u201312a; cf. Giannelli, The Abuse of Scientific\nEvidence in Criminal Cases: The Need for Independent\nCrime Laboratories, 4 Va. J. Soc. Pol\u2019y & L. 439 (1997).\nMoreover, DNA testing itself has exonerated some defend-\nants who previously had been convicted in part upon the\nbasis of testimony by laboratory experts. See Melendez-\nDiaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S., at 319 (citing Garrett &\nNeufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrong-\nful Convictions, 95 Va. L. Rev. 1 (2009)).\n  But if accreditation did not prevent admission of faulty\nevidence in some of those cases, neither did cross-\nexamination. In the wrongful-conviction cases to which\nthis Court has previously referred, the forensic experts all\ntestified in court and were available for cross-examination.\nSklansky, Hearsay\u2019s Last Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 72\u2013\n73 (cited study \u201cdid not identify any cases in which hear-\nsay from forensic analysts contributed to the conviction of\ninnocent defendants\u201d); see Garrett & Neufeld, supra, at\n10\u201312, 84, 89 (noting that cross-examination was rarely\neffective); see also Murphy, The New Forensics: Criminal\nJustice, False Certainty, and the Second Generation of\nScientific Evidence, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 721, 785\u2013786 (2007)\n(suggesting need for greater reliance upon accreditation\nand oversight of accredited laboratories); Sklansky, supra,\nat 74 (same). Similarly, the role of cross-examination is\nambiguous in the laboratory example that the dissent\ndescribes. See post, at 1\u20132. (Apparently, the report\u2019s error\ncame to light and was corrected after cross-examination\nhad concluded, see Thompson, Taroni, & Aitken, Author\u2019s\nResponse, 49 J. Forensic Sci. 1202 (2003), and in any\n12                 WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nevent all parties had received the correctly labeled under-\nlying laboratory data, see Clarke, Commentary, id., at\n1201).\n   For another thing, the fact that the laboratory testing\ntakes place behind a veil of ignorance makes it unlikely\nthat a particular researcher has a defendant-related mo-\ntive to behave dishonestly, say, to misrepresent a step in\nan analysis or otherwise to misreport testing results. Cf.\nMichigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at\n14) (discussing the \u201cprospect of fabrication\u201d as a factor in\nwhether the Confrontation Clause requires statements\n\u201cto be subject to the crucible of cross-examination\u201d). The\nlaboratory here, for example, did not know whether its\ntest results might help to incriminate a particular defend-\nant. Ante, at 32\u201333; cf. Melendez-Diaz, supra, at 310\u2013311;\nBullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   Further, the statements at issue, like those of many\nlaboratory analysts, do not easily fit within the linguistic\nscope of the term \u201ctestimonial statement\u201d as we have used\nthat term in our earlier cases. As the plurality notes, in\nevery post-Crawford case in which the Court has found a\nConfrontation Clause violation, the statement at issue had\nthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\nAnte, at 29\u201331; see, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 822 (2006) (\u201cprimary purpose . . . is to establish or\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal\nprosecution\u201d); Bryant, supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 11\u201312)\n(\u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute\nfor trial testimony\u201d). The declarant was essentially an\nadverse witness making an accusatory, testimonial state-\nment\u2014implicating the core concerns of the Lord Cobham-\ntype affidavits. But here the DNA report sought, not to\naccuse petitioner, but instead to generate objectively a\nprofile of a then-unknown suspect\u2019s DNA from the semen\nhe left in committing the crime. See ante, at 31\u201333.\n   Finally, to bar admission of the out-of-court records at\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          13\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nissue here could undermine, not fortify, the accuracy of\nfactfinding at a criminal trial. Such a precedent could\nbar the admission of other reliable case-specific technical\ninformation such as, say, autopsy reports. Autopsies, like\nthe DNA report in this case, are often conducted when it is\nnot yet clear whether there is a particular suspect or\nwhether the facts found in the autopsy will ultimately\nprove relevant in a criminal trial. Autopsies are typically\nconducted soon after death. And when, say, a victim\u2019s\nbody has decomposed, repetition of the autopsy may not be\npossible. What is to happen if the medical examiner dies\nbefore trial? E.g., State v. Lackey, 280 Kan. 190, 195\u2013196,\n120 P. 3d 332, 341 (2005); see also People v. Geier, 41 Cal.\n4th 555, 601\u2013602, 161 P. 3d 104, 136\u2013137 (2007). Is the\nConfrontation Clause \u201c \u2018effectively\u2019 \u201d to function \u201c \u2018as a\nstatute of limitations for murder\u2019 \u201d? Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat 335 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting Comment, To-\nward a Definition of \u201cTestimonial\u201d: How Autopsy Reports\nDo Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement,\n96 Cal. L. Rev. 1093, 1115 (2008)).\n  In general, such a holding could also increase the risk of\nconvicting the innocent. The New York County District\nAttorney\u2019s Office and the New York City Office of the\nChief Medical Examiner tell us that the additional cost\nand complexity involved in requiring live testimony from\nperhaps dozens of ordinary laboratory technicians who\nparticipate in the preparation of a DNA profile may well\nforce a laboratory \u201cto reduce the amount of DNA testing it\nconducts, and force prosecutors to forgo forensic DNA\nanalysis in cases where it might be highly probative. In\nthe absence of DNA testing, defendants might well be\nprosecuted solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony, the\nreliability of which is often questioned.\u201d NY County DAO\nBrief 10 (citing United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 229\n(1967)); see also NDAA Brief 26 (such a holding \u201cwill also\nimpact the innocent who may wait to be cleared from\n14                 WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nsuspicion or exonerated from mistaken conviction\u201d). I find\nthis plausible. But cf. Innocence Network Brief 3. An\ninterpretation of the Clause that risks greater prosecution\nreliance upon less reliable evidence cannot be sound. Cf.\nMaryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (\u201cThe central\nconcern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reli-\nability of the evidence against a criminal defendant\u201d).\n   Consequently, I would consider reports such as the DNA\nreport before us presumptively to lie outside the perimeter\nof the Clause as established by the Court\u2019s precedents.\nSuch a holding leaves the defendant free to call the labora-\ntory employee as a witness if the employee is available.\nMoreover, should the defendant provide good reason to\ndoubt the laboratory\u2019s competence or the validity of its\naccreditation, then the alternative safeguard of reliability\nwould no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle\ndefendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Similarly,\nshould the defendant demonstrate the existence of a mo-\ntive to falsify, then the alternative safeguard of honesty\nwould no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle\nthe defendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Cf. 2\nWigmore, Evidence \u00a71527, at 1892 (in respect to the busi-\nness records exception, \u201cthere must have been no motive\nto misrepresent\u201d). Thus, the defendant would remain free\nto show the absence or inadequacy of the alternative\nreliability/honesty safeguards, thereby rebutting the pre-\nsumption and making the Confrontation Clause applicable.\nNo one has suggested any such problem in respect to\nthe Cellmark Report at issue here.\n   Because the plurality\u2019s opinion is basically consistent\nwith the views set forth here, I join that opinion in full.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

I reach this conclusion, however, solely\nbecause Cellmark\u2019s statements lacked the requisite \u201cfor-\nmality and solemnity\u201d to be considered \u201c \u2018testimonial\u2019 \u201d for\npurposes of the Confrontation Clause. See Michigan v.\nBryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 1). As I explain below, I share\nthe dissent\u2019s view of the plurality\u2019s flawed analysis.\n                              I\n   The threshold question in this case is whether Cell-\nmark\u2019s statements were hearsay at all. As the Court\nhas explained, \u201c[t]he [Confrontation] Clause . . . does not\nbar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other\nthan establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d See\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 60, n. 9 (2004)\n(citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 414 (1985)).\nHere, the State of Illinois contends that Cellmark\u2019s state-\nments\u2014that it successfully derived a male DNA profile\nand that the profile came from L. J.\u2019s swabs\u2014were intro-\nduced only to show the basis of Lambatos\u2019 opinion, and not\nfor their truth. In my view, however, there was no plau-\nsible reason for the introduction of Cellmark\u2019s statements\n2                   WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nother than to establish their truth.\n                               A\n   Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 (2011) and its federal\ncounterpart permit an expert to base his opinion on facts\nabout which he lacks personal knowledge and to disclose\nthose facts to the trier of fact. Relying on these Rules, the\nState contends that the facts on which an expert\u2019s opinion\nrelies are not to be considered for their truth, but only to\nexplain the basis of his opinion. See People v. Pasch, 152\nIll. 2d 133, 176, 604 N. E. 2d 294, 311 (1992) (\u201cBy allowing\nan expert to reveal the information for this purpose alone,\nit will undoubtedly aid the jury in assessing the value of\nhis opinion\u201d); see also Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on Fed.\nRule Evid. 703, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 361 (stating that ex-\npert basis testimony is admissible \u201conly for the purpose\nof assisting the jury in evaluating an expert\u2019s opinion\u201d).\nAccordingly, in the State\u2019s view, the disclosure of expert\n\u201cbasis testimony\u201d does not implicate the Confrontation\nClause.\n   I do not think that rules of evidence should so easily\ntrump a defendant\u2019s confrontation right. To be sure, we\nshould not \u201clightly swee[p] away an accepted rule\u201d of\nfederal or state evidence law, ante, at 2 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), when applying the Confrontation Clause.\n\u201cRules of limited admissibility are commonplace in evi-\ndence law.\u201d Mnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confronta-\ntion Clause after Crawford v. Washington, 15 J. L. & Pol\u2019y\n791, 812 (2007). And, we often presume that courts and\njuries follow limiting instructions. See, e.g., Street, supra,\nat 415, n. 6. But we have recognized that concepts central\nto the application of the Confrontation Clause are ulti-\nmately matters of federal constitutional law that are not\ndictated by state or federal evidentiary rules. See Barber\nv. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 724\u2013725 (1968) (defining a consti-\ntutional standard for whether a witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfor purposes of the Confrontation Clause); see also Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56, 76 (1980) (recognizing that Barber\n\u201cexplored the issue of constitutional unavailability\u201d (em-\nphasis added)). Likewise, we have held that limiting in-\nstructions may be insufficient in some circumstances to\nprotect against violations of the Confrontation Clause.\nSee Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968).\n   Of particular importance here, we have made sure that\nan out-of-court statement was introduced for a \u201clegitimate,\nnonhearsay purpose\u201d before relying on the not-for-its-truth\nrationale to dismiss the application of the Confrontation\nClause. See Street, 471 U. S., at 417 (emphasis added). In\nStreet, the defendant testified that he gave a false confes-\nsion because police coerced him into parroting his accom-\nplice\u2019s confession. Id., at 411. On rebuttal, the prosecu-\ntion introduced the accomplice\u2019s confession to demonstrate\nto the jury the ways in which the two confessions differed.\nId., at 411\u2013412. Finding no Confrontation Clause prob-\nlem, this Court held that the accomplice\u2019s out-of-court\nconfession was not introduced for its truth, but only to\nimpeach the defendant\u2019s version of events. Id., at 413\u2013\n414. Although the Court noted that the confession was\nnot hearsay \u201cunder traditional rules of evidence,\u201d id., at\n413, the Court did not accept that nonhearsay label at face\nvalue. Instead, the Court thoroughly examined the use of\nthe out-of-court confession and the efficacy of a limiting\ninstruction before concluding that the Confrontation\nClause was satisfied \u201c[i]n this context.\u201d Id., at 417.\n   Unlike the confession in Street, statements introduced\nto explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion are not intro-\nduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose. There is no\nmeaningful distinction between disclosing an out-of-court\nstatement so that the factfinder may evaluate the expert\u2019s\nopinion and disclosing that statement for its truth. \u201cTo\nuse the inadmissible information in evaluating the ex-\npert\u2019s testimony, the jury must make a preliminary judg-\n4                       WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nment about whether this information is true.\u201d D. Kaye, D.\nBernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: A Treatise\non Evidence: Expert Evidence \u00a74.10.1, p. 196 (2d ed. 2011)\n(hereinafter Kaye). \u201cIf the jury believes that the basis\nevidence is true, it will likely also believe that the expert\u2019s\nreliance is justified; inversely, if the jury doubts the accu-\nracy or validity of the basis evidence, it will be skeptical of\nthe expert\u2019s conclusions.\u201d Ibid.1\n  Contrary to the plurality\u2019s suggestion, this common-\nsense conclusion is not undermined by any longstand-\ning historical practice exempting expert basis testimony\nfrom the rigors of the Confrontation Clause. Prior to the\nadoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975, an\nexpert could render an opinion based only on facts that the\nexpert had personally perceived or facts that the expert\nlearned at trial, either by listening to the testimony of\nother witnesses or through a hypothetical question based\non facts in evidence. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on\nFed. Rule Evid. 703, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 361; 29 C. Wright\n& V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a76271,\npp. 300\u2013301 (1997) (hereinafter Wright); 1 K. Broun et al.,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a714, p. 86 (6th ed. 2006) (herein-\nafter Broun); Kaye \u00a74.6, at 156\u2013157. In those situations,\nthere was little danger that the expert would rely on\ntestimonial hearsay that was not subject to confrontation\nbecause the expert and the witnesses on whom he relied\nwere present at trial. It was not until 1975 that the uni-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The plurality relies heavily on the fact that this case involved a\n\nbench trial, emphasizing that a judge sitting as factfinder is pre-\nsumed\u2014more so than a jury\u2014to \u201cunderstand the limited reason for the\ndisclosure\u201d of basis testimony and to \u201cnot rely on that information for\nany improper purpose.\u201d Ante, at 15. Even accepting that presumption,\nthe point is not that the factfinder is unable to understand the restricted\npurpose for basis testimony. Instead, the point is that the purport-\nedly \u201climited reason\u201d for such testimony\u2014to aid the factfinder in\nevaluating the expert\u2019s opinion\u2014necessarily entails an evaluation of\nwhether the basis testimony is true.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nverse of facts upon which an expert could rely was ex-\npanded to include facts of the case that the expert learned\nout of court by means other than his own perception. 1\nBroun \u00a714, at 87; Kaye \u00a74.6, at 157. It is the expert\u2019s\ndisclosure of those facts that raises Confrontation Clause\nconcerns.2\n                             B\n   Those concerns are fully applicable in this case. Lamba-\ntos opined that petitioner\u2019s DNA profile matched the male\nprofile derived from L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs. In reaching\nthat conclusion, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\u2019s out-of-\ncourt statements that the profile it reported was in fact\nderived from L. J.\u2019s swabs, rather than from some other\nsource. Thus, the validity of Lambatos\u2019 opinion ultimately\nturned on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statements. The plural-\nity\u2019s assertion that Cellmark\u2019s statements were merely\nrelayed to explain \u201cthe assumptions on which [Lambatos\u2019]\nopinion rest[ed],\u201d ante, at 3, overlooks that the value of\nLambatos\u2019 testimony depended on the truth of those very\nassumptions.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In its discussion of history, the plurality relies on Beckwith v.\n\nSydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170 Eng. Rep. 897 (K. B. 1807). In that\ncase, experts were asked to render opinions on a ship\u2019s seaworthiness\nbased on facts read into court from the sworn ex parte deposition of a\nwitness who purported to have seen the ship\u2019s deficiencies. To be sure,\nBeckwith involved expert reliance on testimonial hearsay. But Beck-\nwith was an English case decided after the ratification of the Confron-\ntation Clause, and this form of expert testimony does not appear to\nhave been a common feature of early American evidentiary practice.\nSee 29 Wright \u00a76271, at 300\u2013301; 1 Broun \u00a714, at 86\u201387; Kaye \u00a74.6, at\n156\u2013157.\n   3 Cellmark\u2019s statements were not introduced for the nonhearsay pur-\n\npose of showing their effect on Lambatos\u2014i.e., to explain what prompted\nher to search the DNA database for a match. See, e.g., 30B M. Graham,\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a77034.1, pp. 521\u2013529 (interim ed. 2011)\n(noting that out-of-court statements introduced for their effect on\nlistener do not implicate the Confrontation Clause). The statements\n6                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   It is no answer to say that other nonhearsay evidence\nestablished the basis of the expert\u2019s opinion. Here, Lam-\nbatos disclosed Cellmark\u2019s statements that it generated a\nmale DNA profile from L. J.\u2019s swabs, but other evidence\nshowed that L. J.\u2019s swabs contained semen and that the\nswabs were shipped to and received from Cellmark. Ante,\nat 5\u20136. That evidence did not render Cellmark\u2019s state-\nments superfluous. Of course, evidence that Cellmark\nreceived L. J.\u2019s swabs and later produced a DNA profile is\nsome indication that Cellmark in fact generated the profile\nfrom those swabs, rather than from some other source (or\nfrom no source at all). Cf. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu-\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305, 319 (2009) (citing brief that describes\n\u201ccases of documented \u2018drylabbing\u2019 where forensic analysts\nreport results of tests that were never performed,\u201d includ-\ning DNA tests). But the only direct evidence to that effect\nwas Cellmark\u2019s statement, which Lambatos relayed to the\nfactfinder. In any event, the factfinder\u2019s ability to rely on\nother evidence to evaluate an expert\u2019s opinion does not\nalter the conclusion that basis testimony is admitted for\nits truth. The existence of other evidence corroborating\nthe basis testimony may render any Confrontation Clause\nviolation harmless, but it does not change the purpose of\nsuch testimony and thereby place it outside of the reach of\nthe Confrontation Clause.4 I would thus conclude that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat Lambatos conveyed went well beyond what was necessary to\nexplain why she performed the search. Lambatos did not merely\ndisclose that she received a DNA profile from Cellmark. Rather, she\nfurther disclosed Cellmark\u2019s statements that the profile was \u201cmale\u201d and\nthat it was \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.].\u201d App. 56.\nThose facts had nothing to do with her decision to conduct a search.\nThey were introduced for their truth.\n  4 The plurality concludes that the Confrontation Clause would not\n\nbe implicated here \u201ceven if the record did not contain any [other] evi-\ndence that could rationally support a finding that Cellmark produced a\nscientifically reliable DNA profile based on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab.\u201d Ante,\nat 22. But, far from establishing a \u201clegitimate\u201d nonhearsay purpose for\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCellmark\u2019s statements were introduced for their truth.\n                              C\n   The plurality\u2019s contrary conclusion may seem of little\nconsequence to those who view DNA testing and other\nforms of \u201chard science\u201d as intrinsically reliable. But see\nMelendez-Diaz, supra, at 318 (\u201cForensic evidence is not\nuniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\u201d). Today\u2019s\nholding, however, will reach beyond scientific evidence to\nordinary out-of-court statements. For example, it is not\nuncommon for experts to rely on interviews with third\nparties in forming their opinions. See, e.g., People v. Gold-\nstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119, 123\u2013124, 843 N. E. 2d 727, 729\u2013730\n(2005) (psychiatrist disclosed statements made by the\ndefendant\u2019s acquaintances as part of the basis of her opin-\nion that the defendant was motivated to kill by his feelings\nof sexual frustration).\n   It is no answer to say that \u201csafeguards\u201d in the rules of\nevidence will prevent the abuse of basis testimony. Ante,\nat 26. To begin with, courts may be willing to conclude\nthat an expert is not acting as a \u201cmere condui[t]\u201d for hear-\nsay, ante, at 27, as long as he simply provides some opin-\nion based on that hearsay. See Brief for Respondent 18,\nn. 4 (collecting cases). In addition, the hearsay may be the\nkind of fact on which experts in a field reasonably rely.\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Goldstein, supra, at 125, 843\nN. E. 2d, at 731 (evidence showed that reputable psychia-\ntrists relied upon third-party interviews in forming their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCellmark\u2019s statements, Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 417 (1985), a\ncomplete lack of other evidence tending to prove the facts conveyed by\nCellmark\u2019s statements would completely refute the not-for-its-truth\nrationale. The trial court, in announcing its verdict, expressly concluded\nthat petitioner\u2019s DNA matched the \u201cDNA . . . in the semen recovered\nfrom the victim\u2019s vagina.\u201d 4 R. JJJ151. Absent other evidence, it would\nhave been impossible for the trial court to reach that conclusion with-\nout relying on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statement that its test results\nwere based on the semen from L. J.\u2019s swabs.\n8                   WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nopinions). Of course, some courts may determine that\nhearsay of this sort is not substantially more probative\nthan prejudicial and therefore should not be disclosed un-\nder Rule 703. But that balancing test is no substitute\nfor a constitutional provision that has already struck the\nbalance in favor of the accused. See Crawford, 541 U. S.,\nat 61 (\u201c[The Confrontation Clause] commands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-\nexamination\u201d).\n                                II\n\n                                  \n\n                                A\n\n   Having concluded that the statements at issue here\nwere introduced for their truth, I turn to whether they\nwere \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Confrontation\nClause. In Crawford, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he text\nof the Confrontation Clause . . . applies to \u2018witnesses\u2019\nagainst the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear\ntestimony.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). \u201c \u2018Testi-\nmony,\u2019 \u201d in turn, is \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some\nfact.\u2019 \u201d 541 U. S., at 51. In light of its text, I continue to\nthink that the Confrontation Clause regulates only the use\nof statements bearing \u201cindicia of solemnity.\u201d Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 836\u2013837, 840 (2006) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nThis test comports with history because solemnity marked\nthe practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed\nto eliminate, namely, the ex parte examination of wit-\nnesses under the English bail and committal statutes passed\nduring the reign of Queen Mary. See id., at 835; Bryant,\n562 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1); Crawford, supra, at 43\u201345. Accordingly, I\nhave concluded that the Confrontation Clause reaches\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201c \u2018formalized testimonial materials,\u2019 \u201d such as depositions,\naffidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting\nfrom \u201c \u2018formalized dialogue,\u2019 \u201d such as custodial interroga-\ntion. Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see also Davis,\nsupra, at 836\u2013837.5\n    Applying these principles, I conclude that Cellmark\u2019s\nreport is not a statement by a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d within the mean-\ning of the Confrontation Clause. The Cellmark report\nlacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is\nneither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact. No-\nwhere does the report attest that its statements accurately\nreflect the DNA testing processes used or the results ob-\ntained. See Report of Laboratory Examination, Lodging\nof Petitioner. The report is signed by two \u201creviewers,\u201d but\nthey neither purport to have performed the DNA testing\nnor certify the accuracy of those who did. See ibid. And,\nalthough the report was produced at the request of law\nenforcement, it was not the product of any sort of formal-\nized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.\n    The Cellmark report is distinguishable from the labora-\ntory reports that we determined were testimonial in\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S. 305, and in Bullcoming v. New\nMexico, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). In Melendez-Diaz, the re-\nports in question were \u201csworn to before a notary public\nby [the] analysts\u201d who tested a substance for cocaine. 557\nU. S., at 308. In Bullcoming, the report, though unsworn,\nincluded a \u201cCertificate of Analyst\u201d signed by the forensic\nanalyst who tested the defendant\u2019s blood sample. 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The analyst \u201caffirmed that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In addition, I have stated that, because the Confrontation Clause\n\n\u201csought to regulate prosecutorial abuse occurring through use of\nex parte statements,\u201d it \u201calso reaches the use of technically informal\nstatements when used to evade the formalized process.\u201d Davis, 547\nU. S., at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart). But, in this case, there is no indication that Cellmark\u2019s state-\nments were offered \u201cin order to evade confrontation.\u201d Id., at 840.\n10                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u2018[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken\nin the laboratory,\u2019 that \u2018the statements in [the analyst\u2019s\nblock of the report] are correct,\u2019 and that he had \u2018followed\nthe procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid.\n   The dissent insists that the Bullcoming report and\nCellmark\u2019s report are equally formal, separated only by\nsuch \u201cminutia\u201d as the fact that Cellmark\u2019s report \u201cis not\nlabeled a \u2018certificate.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22\u201323 (opinion of KAGAN,\nJ.). To the contrary, what distinguishes the two is that\nCellmark\u2019s report, in substance, certifies nothing. See su-\npra, at 9. That distinction is constitutionally significant\nbecause the scope of the confrontation right is properly\nlimited to extrajudicial statements similar in solemnity to\nthe Marian examination practices that the Confrontation\nClause was designed to prevent. See Davis, supra, at 835\u2013\n836 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). By certifying the truth of the\nanalyst\u2019s representations, the unsworn Bullcoming report\nbore \u201ca \u2018striking resemblance,\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 837 (quot-\ning Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52), to the Marian practice in\nwhich magistrates examined witnesses, typically on oath,\nand \u201ccertif[ied] the results to the court.\u201d Id., at 44. And,\nin Melendez-Diaz, we observed that \u201c \u2018certificates\u2019 are\nfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing\nprecisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u201d 557\nU. S., at 310\u2013311. Cellmark\u2019s report is marked by no such\nindicia of solemnity.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, acknowledging\nthat the Confrontation Clause is implicated only by for-\nmalized statements that are characterized by solemnity\nwill not result in a prosecutorial conspiracy to elude con-\nfrontation by using only informal extrajudicial statements\nagainst an accused. As I have previously noted, the Con-\nfrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the\nformalized process. See supra, at 9, n. 5 (quoting Davis,\n547 U. S., at 838). Moreover, the prosecution\u2019s use of\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninformal statements comes at a price. As the dissent\nrecognizes, such statements are \u201cless reliable\u201d than for-\nmalized statements, post, at 24, and therefore less persua-\nsive to the factfinder. Cf. post, at 21\u201322, n. 6 (arguing that\nprosecutors are unlikely to \u201cforgo DNA evidence in favor of\nless reliable eyewitness testimony\u201d simply because the\ndefendant is entitled to confront the DNA analyst). But,\neven assuming that the dissent accurately predicts an\nupswing in the use of \u201cless reliable\u201d informal statements,\nthat result does not \u201cturn the Confrontation Clause upside\ndown.\u201d Post, at 24. The Confrontation Clause does not\nrequire that evidence be reliable, Crawford, supra, at 61,\nbut that the reliability of a specific \u201cclass of testimonial\nstatements\u201d\u2014formalized statements bearing indicia of\nsolemnity\u2014be assessed through cross-examination. See\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 309\u2013310.\n                             B\n   Rather than apply the foregoing principles, the plurality\ninvokes its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test. The original formula-\ntion of that test asked whether the primary purpose of an\nextrajudicial statement was \u201cto establish or prove past\nevents potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d\nDavis, supra, at 822. I agree that, for a statement to be\ntestimonial within the meaning of the Confrontation\nClause, the declarant must primarily intend to establish\nsome fact with the understanding that his statement may\nbe used in a criminal prosecution. See Bryant, 562 U. S.,\nat ___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\u20133). But this\nnecessary criterion is not sufficient, for it sweeps into the\nambit of the Confrontation Clause statements that lack\nformality and solemnity and is thus \u201cdisconnected from\nhistory.\u201d Davis, supra, at 838\u2013842 (opinion concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); Bryant, supra, at\n___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). In\naddition, a primary purpose inquiry divorced from solem-\n12                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnity is unworkable in practice. Davis, supra, at 839; Bry-\nant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1). Statements to police are\noften made both to resolve an ongoing emergency and to\nestablish facts about a crime for potential prosecution.\nThe primary purpose test gives courts no principled way to\nassign primacy to one of those purposes. Davis, supra, at\n839. The solemnity requirement is not only true to the\ntext and history of the Confrontation Clause, but goes a\nlong way toward resolving that practical difficulty. If a\nstatement bears the formality and solemnity necessary to\ncome within the scope of the Clause, it is highly unlikely\nthat the statement was primarily made to end an ongoing\nemergency.\n  The shortcomings of the original primary purpose test\npale in comparison, however, to those plaguing the refor-\nmulated version that the plurality suggests today. The\nnew primary purpose test asks whether an out-of-court\nstatement has \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted\nindividual of engaging in criminal conduct.\u201d Ante, at 29.\nThat test lacks any grounding in constitutional text, in\nhistory, or in logic.\n  The new test first requires that an out-of-court state-\nment be made \u201cfor the purpose of proving the guilt of\na particular criminal defendant.\u201d Ante, at 30 (emphasis\nadded). Under this formulation, statements made \u201cbefore\nany suspect was identified\u201d are beyond the scope of the\nConfrontation Clause. See ante, at 3. There is no textual\njustification, however, for limiting the confrontation right\nto statements made after the accused\u2019s identity became\nknown. To be sure, the Sixth Amendment right to con-\nfrontation attaches \u201c[i]n . . . criminal prosecutions,\u201d at\nwhich time the accused has been identified and appre-\nhended. But the text of the Confrontation Clause does not\nconstrain the time at which one becomes a \u201cwitnes[s].\u201d\nIndeed, we have previously held that a declarant may\nbecome a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d before the accused\u2019s prosecution. See\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             13\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCrawford, 541 U. S., at 50\u201351 (rejecting the view that the\nConfrontation Clause applies only to in-court testimony).\n  Historical practice confirms that a declarant could\nbecome a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d before the accused\u2019s identity was\nknown. As previously noted, the confrontation right was\na response to ex parte examinations of witnesses in 16th-\ncentury England. Such examinations often occurred after\nan accused was arrested or bound over for trial, but some\nexaminations occurred while the accused remained \u201cun-\nknown or fugitive.\u201d J. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the\nRenaissance 90 (1974) (describing examples, including the\ndeposition of a victim who was swindled out of 20 shillings\nby a \u201c \u2018cunning man\u2019 \u201d); see also 1 J. Stephen, A History of\nthe Criminal Law of England 217\u2013218 (1883) (describ-\ning the sworn examinations of witnesses by coroners, who\nwere charged with investigating suspicious deaths by\nasking local citizens if they knew \u201cwho [was] culpable\neither of the act or of the force\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  There is also little logical justification for the plurality\u2019s\nrule. The plurality characterizes Cellmark\u2019s report as a\nstatement elicited by police and made by Cellmark not \u201cto\naccuse petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial,\u201d but\nrather to resolve the ongoing emergency posed by \u201ca dan-\ngerous rapist who was still at large.\u201d Ante, at 31. But, as\nI have explained, that distinction is unworkable in light of\nthe mixed purposes that often underlie statements to the\npolice. See supra, at 12. The difficulty is only compound-\ned by the plurality\u2019s attempt to merge the purposes of both\nthe police and the declarant. See ante, at 29; Bryant,\nsupra, at ___\u2013___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 20\u201323).\n  But if one purpose must prevail, here it should surely be\nthe evidentiary one, whether viewed from the perspective\nof the police, Cellmark, or both. The police confirmed the\npresence of semen on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs on February 15,\n2000, placed the swabs in a freezer, and waited until\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNovember 28, 2000, to ship them to Cellmark. App. 30\u2013\n34, 51\u201352. Cellmark, in turn, did not send its report to\nthe police until April 3, 2001, id., at 54, over a year\nafter L. J.\u2019s rape. Given this timeline, it strains credulity\nto assert that the police and Cellmark were primarily\nconcerned with the exigencies of an ongoing emergency,\nrather than with producing evidence in the ordinary course.\n   In addition to requiring that an out-of-court statement\n\u201ctarge[t]\u201d a particular accused, the plurality\u2019s new primary\npurpose test also considers whether the statement is so\n\u201cinherently inculpatory,\u201d ante, at 3, that the declarant\nshould have known that his statement would incriminate\nthe accused. In this case, the plurality asserts that \u201c[t]he\ntechnicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no\nway of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminat-\ning or exonerating\u2014or both,\u201d ante, at 32, and thus \u201cno one\nat Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile\nthat it produced would turn out to inculpate petitioner,\u201d\nante, at 31.\n   Again, there is no textual justification for this limitation\non the scope of the Confrontation Clause. In Melendez-\nDiaz, we held that \u201c[t]he text of the [Sixth] Amendment\ncontemplates two classes of witnesses\u2014those against the\ndefendant and those in his favor.\u201d 557 U. S., at 313\u2013314.\nWe emphasized that \u201cthere is not a third category of wit-\nnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune\nfrom confrontation.\u201d Id., at 314. Thus, the distinction\nbetween those who make \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d state-\nments and those who make other statements that are\nmerely \u201chelpful to the prosecution\u201d has no foundation in\nthe text of the Amendment.\n   It is also contrary to history. The 16th-century Marian\nstatutes instructed magistrates to transcribe any infor-\nmation by witnesses that \u201c \u2018shall be material to prove the\nfelony.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g., 1 Stephen, supra, at 219 (quoting 1 & 2\nPhil. & Mary, ch. 13 (1554)). Magistrates in the 17th and\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  15\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n18th centuries were also advised by practice manuals to\ntake the ex parte examination of a witness even if his evi-\ndence was \u201cweak\u201d or the witness was \u201cunable to inform\nany material thing against\u201d an accused. J. Beattie, Crime\nand the Courts in England: 1660\u20131800, p. 272 (1986)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, neither law nor\npractice limited ex parte examinations to those witnesses\nwho made \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d statements.\n   This requirement also makes little sense. A statement\nthat is not facially inculpatory may turn out to be highly\nprobative of a defendant\u2019s guilt when considered with\nother evidence. Recognizing this point, we previously\nrejected the view that a witness is not subject to confron-\ntation if his testimony is \u201cinculpatory only when taken\ntogether with other evidence.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra, at\n313. I see no justification for reviving that discredited\napproach, and the plurality offers none.6\n                          *      *     *\n   Respondent and its amici have emphasized the econom-\nic and logistical burdens that would be visited upon States\nshould every analyst who reports DNA results be required\nto testify at trial. See, e.g., ante, at 32 (citing brief stating\nthat some crime labs use up to 12 technicians when test-\ning a DNA sample). These burdens are largely the prod-\nuct of a primary purpose test that reaches out-of-court\nstatements well beyond the historical scope of the Con-\nfrontation Clause and thus sweeps in a broad range of\nsources on which modern experts regularly rely. The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The plurality states that its test \u201cwill not prejudice any defendant\n\nwho really wishes to probe the reliability\u201d of out-of-court statements\nintroduced in his case because the person or persons who made the\nstatements \u201cmay always be subpoenaed by the defense and questioned\nat trial.\u201d Ante, at 4. Melendez-Diaz rejected this reasoning as well,\nholding that the defendant\u2019s subpoena power \u201cis no substitute for the\nright of confrontation.\u201d 557 U.

See ante, at 3. Nor is it to\ncreate a new primary purpose test that ensures that DNA\nevidence is treated differently. See ibid. Rather, the\nsolution is to adopt a reading of the Confrontation Clause\nthat respects its historically limited application to a nar-\nrow class of statements bearing indicia of solemnity. In\nforgoing that approach, today\u2019s decision diminishes the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s protection in cases where experts\nconvey the contents of solemn, formalized statements to\nexplain the bases for their opinions. These are the very\ncases in which the accused should \u201cenjoy the right . . . to\nbe confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The analyst had\nextracted DNA from a bloody sweatshirt found at the\ncrime scene and then compared it to two control samples\u2014\none from Kocak and one from the victim. The analyst\u2019s\nreport identified a single match: As she explained on\ndirect examination, the DNA found on the sweatshirt\nbelonged to Kocak.          But after undergoing cross-\nexamination, the analyst realized she had made a mortify-\ning error. She took the stand again, but this time to admit\nthat the report listed the victim\u2019s control sample as coming\nfrom Kocak, and Kocak\u2019s as coming from the victim. So\nthe DNA on the sweatshirt matched not Kocak, but the\nvictim herself. See Tr. in No. SCD110465 (Super. Ct. San\nDiego Cty., Cal., Nov. 17, 1995), pp. 3\u20134 (\u201cI\u2019m a little hys-\nterical right now, but I think . . . the two names should be\nswitched\u201d), online at http: //www.nlada.org/forensics/for_\nlib/Documents/1037341561.0/JohnIvanKocak.pdf (as vis-\nited June 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). In trying Kocak, the State would have to look else-\nwhere for its evidence.\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Our Constitution contains a mechanism for catching\nsuch errors\u2014the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation\nClause. That Clause, and the Court\u2019s recent cases inter-\npreting it, require that testimony against a criminal de-\nfendant be subject to cross-examination. And that com-\nmand applies with full force to forensic evidence of the\nkind involved in both the Kocak case and this one. In two\ndecisions issued in the last three years, this Court held\nthat if a prosecutor wants to introduce the results of fo-\nrensic testing into evidence, he must afford the defendant\nan opportunity to cross-examine an analyst responsible for\nthe test. Forensic evidence is reliable only when properly\nproduced, and the Confrontation Clause prescribes a par-\nticular method for determining whether that has hap-\npened. The Kocak incident illustrates how the Clause is\ndesigned to work: Once confronted, the analyst discovered\nand disclosed the error she had made. That error would\nprobably not have come to light if the prosecutor had\nmerely admitted the report into evidence or asked a third\nparty to present its findings. Hence the genius of an 18th-\ncentury device as applied to 21st-century evidence: Cross-\nexamination of the analyst is especially likely to reveal\nwhether vials have been switched, samples contaminated,\ntests incompetently run, or results inaccurately recorded.\n   Under our Confrontation Clause precedents, this is\nan open-and-shut case. The State of Illinois prosecuted\nSandy Williams for rape based in part on a DNA profile\ncreated in Cellmark\u2019s laboratory. Yet the State did not\ngive Williams a chance to question the analyst who pro-\nduced that evidence. Instead, the prosecution introduced\nthe results of Cellmark\u2019s testing through an expert wit-\nness who had no idea how they were generated. That\napproach\u2014no less (perhaps more) than the confrontation-\nfree methods of presenting forensic evidence we have\nformerly banned\u2014deprived Williams of his Sixth Amend-\nment right to \u201cconfron[t] . . . the witnesses against him.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court today disagrees, though it cannot settle on a\nreason why. JUSTICE ALITO, joined by three other Jus-\ntices, advances two theories\u2014that the expert\u2019s summary of\nthe Cellmark report was not offered for its truth, and\nthat the report is not the kind of statement triggering the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s protection. In the pages that\nfollow, I call JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s opinion \u201cthe plurality,\u201d\nbecause that is the conventional term for it. But in all\nexcept its disposition, his opinion is a dissent: Five Jus-\ntices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning\nand every paragraph of its explication. See ante, at 1\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cI share the dis-\nsent\u2019s view of the plurality\u2019s flawed analysis\u201d). JUSTICE\nTHOMAS, for his part, contends that the Cellmark report\nis nontestimonial on a different rationale. But no other\nJustice joins his opinion or subscribes to the test he offers.\n   That creates five votes to approve the admission of the\nCellmark report, but not a single good explanation. The\nplurality\u2019s first rationale endorses a prosecutorial dodge;\nits second relies on distinguishing indistinguishable foren-\nsic reports. JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s concurrence, though posit-\ning an altogether different approach, suffers in the end\nfrom similar flaws. I would choose another path\u2014to\nadhere to the simple rule established in our decisions, for\nthe good reasons we have previously given. Because de-\nfendants like Williams have a constitutional right to con-\nfront the witnesses against them, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s fractured decision.\n                            I\n  Our modern Confrontation Clause doctrine began with\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004). About a\nquarter century earlier, we had interpreted the Clause to\nallow the admission of any out-of-court statement falling\nwithin a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or carrying\n\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Ohio v.\n4                    WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980). But in Crawford, we\nconcluded that our old approach was misguided. Drawing\non historical research about the Clause\u2019s purposes, we\nheld that the prosecution may not admit \u201ctestimonial\nstatements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial\nunless he [is] unavailable to testify, and the defendant . . .\nhad a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 53\u201354. That holding has two aspects. First, the Con-\nfrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements\nthat are \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Second, where the Clause applies,\nit guarantees to a defendant just what its name sug-\ngests\u2014the opportunity to cross-examine the person who\nmade the statement. See id., at 59.\n    A few years later, we made clear that Crawford\u2019s rule\nreaches forensic reports. In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\u00ad\n\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305 (2009), the Commonwealth introduced\na laboratory\u2019s \u201c \u2018certificates of analysis\u2019 \u201d stating that a sub-\nstance seized from the defendant was cocaine. Id., at\n308. We held that the certificates fell within the Clause\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018core class of testimonial statements\u2019 \u201d because they had\na clear \u201cevidentiary purpose\u201d: They were \u201c \u2018made under\ncircumstances which would lead an objective witness\nreasonably to believe that [they] would be available for use\nat a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 310\u2013311 (quoting Crawford, 541\nU. S., at 51\u201352). Accordingly, we ruled, the defendant had\na right to cross-examine the analysts who had authored\nthem.      In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the\nCommonwealth\u2019s argument that the Confrontation Clause\nshould not apply because the statements resulted from\n\u201c \u2018neutral scientific testing,\u2019 \u201d and so were presumptively\nreliable. 557 U. S., at 318. The Clause, we noted,\ncommands that \u201c \u2018reliability be assessed in a particular\nmanner\u2019 \u201d\u2014through \u201c \u2018testing in the crucible of cross-\nexamination.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 317 (quoting Crawford, 541 U. S., at\n61). Further, we doubted that the testing summarized\nin the certificates was \u201cas neutral or as reliable\u201d as the\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nCommonwealth suggested. Citing chapter and verse from\nvarious studies, we concluded that \u201c[f]orensic evidence is\nnot uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\u201d and\nmistake. 557 U. S., at 318; see id., at 319.\n   And just two years later (and just one year ago), we\nreiterated Melendez-Diaz\u2019s analysis when faced with a\nState\u2019s attempt to evade it. In Bullcoming v. New Mexico,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), a forensic report showed the defend-\nant\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration to exceed the legal limit\nfor drivers. The State tried to introduce that finding\nthrough the testimony of a person who worked at the\nlaboratory but had not performed or observed the blood\ntest or certified its results. We held that Melendez-Diaz\nforeclosed that tactic. The report, we stated, resembled\nthe certificates in Melendez-Diaz in \u201call material respects,\u201d\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15): Both were signed docu-\nments providing the results of forensic testing designed to\n\u201c \u2018prov[e] some fact\u2019 in a criminal proceeding,\u201d id., at ___\n(slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310).\nAnd the State\u2019s resort to a \u201csurrogate\u201d witness, in place\nof the analyst who produced the report, did not satisfy the\nConfrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). Only the presence of \u201cthat particular scientist,\u201d\nwe reasoned, would enable Bullcoming\u2019s counsel to ask\n\u201cquestions designed to reveal whether incompetence . . . or\ndishonesty\u201d had tainted the results. Id., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 2, 12). Repeating the refrain of Melendez-Diaz, we\nheld that \u201c[t]he accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with\u201d\nthe actual analyst, unless he is unavailable and the ac-\ncused \u201chad an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine\u201d\nhim. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\n   This case is of a piece. The report at issue here shows a\nDNA profile produced by an analyst at Cellmark\u2019s labora-\ntory, allegedly from a vaginal swab taken from a young\nwoman, L. J., after she was raped. That report is identical\nto the one in Bullcoming (and Melendez-Diaz) in \u201call mate-\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nrial respects.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Once\nagain, the report was made to establish \u201c \u2018some fact\u2019 in a\ncriminal proceeding\u201d\u2014here, the identity of L. J.\u2019s attacker.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557\nU. S., at 310); see infra, at 20. And once again, it details\nthe results of forensic testing on evidence gathered by the\npolice. Viewed side-by-side with the Bullcoming report,\nthe Cellmark analysis has a comparable title; similarly\ndescribes the relevant samples, test methodology, and\nresults; and likewise includes the signatures of laboratory\nofficials. Compare Cellmark Diagnostics Report of Labor-\natory Examination (Feb. 15, 2001), Lodging of Petitioner\nwith App. in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, O. T. 2010, No.\n09\u201310876, pp. 62\u201365. So under this Court\u2019s prior analysis,\nthe substance of the report could come into evidence only\nif Williams had a chance to cross-examine the responsible\nanalyst.\n   But that is not what happened. Instead, the prosecutor\nused Sandra Lambatos\u2014a state-employed scientist who\nhad not participated in the testing\u2014as the conduit for this\npiece of evidence. Lambatos came to the stand after two\nother state analysts testified about forensic tests they had\nperformed. One recounted how she had developed a DNA\nprofile of Sandy Williams from a blood sample drawn after\nhis arrest. And another told how he had confirmed the\npresence of (unidentified) semen on the vaginal swabs\ntaken from L. J. All this was by the book: Williams had\nan opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses about the\ntests they had run. But of course, the State still needed to\nsupply the missing link\u2014it had to show that DNA found\nin the semen on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs matched Williams\u2019s\nDNA. To fill that gap, the prosecutor could have called the\nanalyst from Cellmark to testify about the DNA profile she\nhad produced from the swabs. But instead, the State\ncalled Lambatos as an expert witness and had her testify\nthat the semen on those swabs contained Sandy Wil-\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)         7\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nliams\u2019s DNA:\n    \u201cQ Was there a computer match generated of the\n    male DNA profile found in semen from the vaginal\n    swabs of [L. J.] to a male DNA profile that had been\n    identified as having originated from Sandy Williams?\n\n    \u201cA Yes, there was.\n\n    \u201cQ Did you compare the semen . . . from the vaginal\n    swabs of [L. J.] to the male DNA profile . . . from the\n    blood of Sandy Williams?\n\n    \u201cA Yes, I did.\n\n    .           .               .               .    .\n\n    \u201cQ [I]s the semen identified in the vaginal swabs of\n    [L. J.] consistent with having originated from Sandy\n    Williams?\n\n    \u201cA Yes.\u201d App. 56\u201357.\nAnd so it was Lambatos, rather than any Cellmark em-\nployee, who informed the trier of fact that the testing of\nL. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs had produced a male DNA profile\nimplicating Williams.\n  Have we not already decided this case? Lambatos\u2019s\ntestimony is functionally identical to the \u201csurrogate testi-\nmony\u201d that New Mexico proffered in Bullcoming, which\ndid nothing to cure the problem identified in Melendez-\nDiaz (which, for its part, straightforwardly applied our\ndecision in Crawford). Like the surrogate witness in\nBullcoming, Lambatos \u201ccould not convey what [the actual\nanalyst] knew or observed about the events . . . , i.e., the\nparticular test and testing process he employed.\u201d Bull\u00ad\ncoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). \u201cNor could such\n8                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nsurrogate testimony expose any lapses or lies\u201d on the\ntesting analyst\u2019s part. Ibid. Like the lawyers in Melendez-\nDiaz and Bullcoming, Williams\u2019s attorney could not ask\nquestions about that analyst\u2019s \u201cproficiency, the care he\ntook in performing his work, and his veracity.\u201d 564 U. S.,\nat ___, n. 7 (slip op., at 12, n. 7). He could not probe\nwhether the analyst had tested the wrong vial, inverted\nthe labels on the samples, committed some more technical\nerror, or simply made up the results. See App. to Brief for\nPublic Defender Service for the District of Columbia et al.\nas Amici Curiae 5a, 11a (describing mistakes and fraud\nat Cellmark\u2019s laboratory). Indeed, Williams\u2019s lawyer was\neven more hamstrung than Bullcoming\u2019s. At least the\nsurrogate witness in Bullcoming worked at the relevant\nlaboratory and was familiar with its procedures. That is\nnot true of Lambatos: She had no knowledge at all of\nCellmark\u2019s operations. Indeed, for all the record discloses,\nshe may never have set foot in Cellmark\u2019s laboratory.\n   Under our case law, that is sufficient to resolve this\ncase. \u201c[W]hen the State elected to introduce\u201d the sub-\nstance of Cellmark\u2019s report into evidence, the analyst who\ngenerated that report \u201cbecame a witness\u201d whom Williams\n\u201chad the right to confront.\u201d Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13). As we stated just last year, \u201cOur prece-\ndent[s] cannot sensibly be read any other way.\u201d Ibid.\n                              II\n  The plurality\u2019s primary argument to the contrary tries\nto exploit a limit to the Confrontation Clause recognized in\nCrawford. \u201cThe Clause,\u201d we cautioned there, \u201cdoes not bar\nthe use of testimonial statements for purposes other than\nestablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 59\u201360, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409,\n414 (1985)). The Illinois Supreme Court relied on that\nstatement in concluding that Lambatos\u2019s testimony was\npermissible. On that court\u2019s view, \u201cLambatos disclosed\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

E.\n2d 268, 282 (2010). The plurality wraps itself in that\nholding, similarly asserting that Lambatos\u2019s recitation of\nCellmark\u2019s findings, when viewed through the prism of\nstate evidence law, was not introduced to establish \u201cthe\ntruth of any . . . matter concerning [the] Cellmark\u201d report.\nAnte, at 16; see ante, at 2, 24\u201325. But five Justices agree,\nin two opinions reciting the same reasons, that this\nargument has no merit: Lambatos\u2019s statements about\nCellmark\u2019s report went to its truth, and the State could\nnot rely on her status as an expert to circumvent the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s requirements. See ante, at 2\u20138\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  To see why, start with the kind of case Crawford had in\nmind. In acknowledging the not-for-the-truth carveout\nfrom the Clause, the Court cited Tennessee v. Street as\nexemplary. See Crawford, 541 U. S., at 59\u201360, n. 9.\nThere, Street claimed that his stationhouse confession of\nmurder was a sham: A police officer, he charged, had read\naloud his alleged accomplice\u2019s confession and forced him to\nrepeat it. To help rebut that defense, the State introduced\nthe other confession into the record, so the jury could see\nhow it differed from Street\u2019s. This Court rejected Street\u2019s\nConfrontation Clause claim because the State had offered\nthe out-of-court statement not to prove \u201cthe truth of\n[the accomplice\u2019s] assertions\u201d about the murder, but only to\ndisprove Street\u2019s claim of how the police elicited his con-\nfession. Street, 471 U. S., at 413. Otherwise said, the\ntruth of the admitted statement was utterly immaterial;\nthe only thing that mattered was that the statement\n(whether true or false) varied from Street\u2019s.\n  The situation could not be more different when a wit-\nness, expert or otherwise, repeats an out-of-court state-\n10                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nment as the basis for a conclusion, because the statement\u2019s\nutility is then dependent on its truth. If the statement is\ntrue, then the conclusion based on it is probably true; if\nnot, not. So to determine the validity of the witness\u2019s\nconclusion, the factfinder must assess the truth of the out-\nof-court statement on which it relies. That is why the\nprincipal modern treatise on evidence variously calls the\nidea that such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d comes in not for its truth,\nbut only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert\u2019s opin-\nion \u201cvery weak,\u201d \u201cfactually implausible,\u201d \u201cnonsense,\u201d and\n\u201csheer fiction.\u201d D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, & J. Mnookin, The\nNew Wigmore: Expert Evidence \u00a74.10.1, pp. 196\u2013197 (2d\ned. 2011); id., \u00a74.11.6, at 24 (Supp. 2012). \u201cOne can sym-\npathize,\u201d notes that treatise, \u201cwith a court\u2019s desire to\npermit the disclosure of basis evidence that is quite prob-\nably reliable, such as a routine analysis of a drug, but to\npretend that it is not being introduced for the truth of its\ncontents strains credibility.\u201d Id., \u00a74.10.1, at 198 (2d ed.\n2011); see also, e.g., People v. Goldstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119,\n128, 843 N. E. 2d 727, 732\u2013733 (2005) (\u201cThe distinction\nbetween a statement offered for its truth and a statement\noffered to shed light on an expert\u2019s opinion is not meaning-\nful\u201d). Unlike in Street, admission of the out-of-court\nstatement in this context has no purpose separate from its\ntruth; the factfinder can do nothing with it except assess\nits truth and so the credibility of the conclusion it serves to\nbuttress.1\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In responding to this reasoning, the plurality confirms it. According\n\nto the plurality, basis evidence supports the \u201ccredibility of the expert\u2019s\nopinion\u201d by showing that he has relied on, and drawn logical inferences\nfrom, sound \u201cfactual premises.\u201d Ante, at 24. Quite right. And that\nprocess involves assessing such premises\u2019 truth: If they are, as the\nplurality puts it, \u201cunsupported by other evidence in the record\u201d or\notherwise baseless, they will not \u201callay [a factfinder\u2019s] fears\u201d about an\n\u201cexpert\u2019s reasoning.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325. I could not have said it any\nbetter.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Consider a prosaic example not involving scientific ex-\nperts. An eyewitness tells a police officer investigating\nan assault that the perpetrator had an unusual, star-\nshaped birthmark over his left eye. The officer arrests a\nperson bearing that birthmark (let\u2019s call him Starr) for\ncommitting the offense. And at trial, the officer takes the\nstand and recounts just what the eyewitness told him.\nPresumably the plurality would agree that such testimony\nviolates the Confrontation Clause unless the eyewitness is\nunavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to\ncross-examine him. Now ask whether anything changes if\nthe officer couches his testimony in the following way: \u201cI\nconcluded that Starr was the assailant because a reliable\neyewitness told me that the assailant had a star-shaped\nbirthmark and, look, Starr has one just like that.\u201d Surely\nthat framing would make no constitutional difference,\neven though the eyewitness\u2019s statement now explains the\nbasis for the officer\u2019s conclusion. It remains the case that\nthe prosecution is attempting to introduce a testimonial\nstatement that has no relevance to the proceedings apart\nfrom its truth\u2014and that the defendant cannot cross-\nexamine the person who made it. Allowing the admission\nof this evidence would end-run the Confrontation Clause,\nand make a parody of its strictures.\n   And that example, when dressed in scientific clothing, is\nno different from this case. The Cellmark report identified\nthe rapist as having a particular DNA profile (think of\nit as the quintessential birthmark). The Confrontation\nClause prevented the State from introducing that report\ninto evidence except by calling to the stand the person who\nprepared it. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310\u2013311;\nBullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). So the State\ntried another route\u2014introducing the substance of the re-\nport as part and parcel of an expert witness\u2019s conclusion.\nIn effect, Lambatos testified (like the police officer above):\n\u201cI concluded that Williams was the rapist because Cell-\n12                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmark, an accredited and trustworthy laboratory, says\nthat the rapist has a particular DNA profile and, look,\nWilliams has an identical one.\u201d And here too, that form\nof testimony should change nothing. The use of the\nCellmark statement remained bound up with its truth,\nand the statement came into evidence without any oppor-\ntunity for Williams to cross-examine the person who made\nit. So if the plurality were right, the State would have a\nready method to bypass the Constitution (as much as in\nmy hypothetical case); a wink and a nod, and the Confron-\ntation Clause would not pose a bar to forensic evidence.\n   The plurality tries to make plausible its not-for-the-\ntruth rationale by rewriting Lambatos\u2019s testimony about\nthe Cellmark report. According to the plurality, Lambatos\nmerely \u201cassumed\u201d that Cellmark\u2019s DNA profile came from\nL. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs, accepting for the sake of argument\nthe prosecutor\u2019s premise. Ante, at 18. But that is incor-\nrect. Nothing in Lambatos\u2019s testimony indicates that she\nwas making an assumption or considering a hypothesis.\nTo the contrary, Lambatos affirmed, without qualification,\nthat the Cellmark report showed a \u201cmale DNA profile\nfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.].\u201d App.\n56. Had she done otherwise, this case would be different.\nThere was nothing wrong with Lambatos\u2019s testifying that\ntwo DNA profiles\u2014the one shown in the Cellmark report\nand the one derived from Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched each\nother; that was a straightforward application of Lamba-\ntos\u2019s expertise. Similarly, Lambatos could have added\nthat if the Cellmark report resulted from scientifically\nsound testing of L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab, then it would link\nWilliams to the assault. What Lambatos could not do was\nwhat she did: indicate that the Cellmark report was pro-\nduced in this way by saying that L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab\ncontained DNA matching Williams\u2019s.2 By testifying in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 The   plurality suggests that Lambatos\u2019s testimony is merely a mod-\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    13\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthat manner, Lambatos became just like the surrogate\nwitness in Bullcoming\u2014a person knowing nothing about\n\u201cthe particular test and testing process,\u201d but vouching for\nthem regardless. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We\nhave held that the Confrontation Clause requires some-\nthing more.\n   The plurality also argues that Lambatos\u2019s characteriza-\ntion of the Cellmark report did not violate the Confronta-\ntion Clause because the case \u201cinvolve[d] a bench trial.\u201d\nAnte, at 19 (emphasis deleted). I welcome the plurality\u2019s\nconcession that the Clause might forbid presenting Lam-\nbatos\u2019s statement to a jury, see ante, at 18\u201319; it indicates\nthat the plurality realizes that her testimony went beyond\nan \u201cassumption.\u201d But the presence of a judge does not\ntransform the constitutional question. In applying the\nConfrontation Clause, we have never before considered\nrelevant the decisionmaker\u2019s identity. See, e.g., Davis v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nern, streamlined way of answering hypothetical questions and therefore\nraises no constitutional issue, see ante, at 2, 13\u201315; similarly, the\nplurality contends that the difference between what Lambatos said and\nwhat I would allow involves only \u201cslightly revis[ing]\u201d her testimony and\nso can be of no consequence, see ante, at 18, n. 3. But the statement \u201cif\nX is true, then Y follows\u201d differs materially\u2014and constitutionally\u2014\nfrom the statement \u201cY is true because X is true (according to Z).\u201d The\nformer statement is merely a logical proposition, whose validity the\ndefendant can contest by questioning the speaker. And then, assum-\ning the prosecutor tries to prove the statement\u2019s premise through some\nother witness, the defendant can rebut that effort through cross-\nexamination. By contrast, the latter statement as well contains a\nfactual allegation (that X is true), which the defendant can only effec-\ntively challenge by confronting the person who made it (Z). That is why\nrecognizing the difference between these two forms of testimony is not\nto insist on an archaism or a formality, but to ensure, in line with the\nConstitution, that defendants have the ability to confront their accus-\ners. And if prosecutors can easily conform their conduct to that consti-\ntutional directive, as the plurality suggests, so much the better: I would\nnot have thought it a ground of complaint that the Confrontation\nClause, properly understood, manages to protect defendants without\noverly burdening the State.\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813 (2006). And this case would\nbe a poor place to begin. Lambatos\u2019s description of the\nCellmark report was offered for its truth because that is\nall such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d can be offered for; as described\nearlier, the only way the factfinder could consider whether\nthat statement supported her opinion (that the DNA on\nL. J.\u2019s swabs came from Williams) was by assessing the\nstatement\u2019s truth. See supra, at 9\u201312. That is so, as a\nsimple matter of logic, whether the factfinder is a judge or\na jury. And thus, in either case, admission of the state-\nment, without the opportunity to cross-examine, violates\nthe Confrontation Clause. See ante, at 3\u20134, n. 1 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.).\n   In saying that much, I do not doubt that a judge typi-\ncally will do better than a jury in excluding such inadmis-\nsible evidence from his decisionmaking process. Perhaps\nthe judge did so here; perhaps, as the plurality thinks, he un-\nderstood that he could not consider Lambatos\u2019s repre-\nsentation about the Cellmark report, and found that other,\n\u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d established \u201cthe source of the\nsample that Cellmark tested\u201d and \u201cthe reliability of the\nCellmark profile.\u201d See ante, at 22\u201323. Some indications\nare to the contrary: In delivering his verdict, the judge\nnever referred to the circumstantial evidence the plurality\nmarshals, but instead focused only on Lambatos\u2019s testi-\nmony. See 4 Record JJJ151 (calling Lambatos \u201cthe best\nDNA witness I have ever heard\u201d and referring to Williams\nas \u201cthe guy whose DNA, according to the evidence from\nthe experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s\nvagina\u201d). But I take the plurality\u2019s point that when read\n\u201c[i]n context\u201d the judge\u2019s statements might be \u201cbest under-\nstood\u201d as meaning something other than what they appear\nto say. See ante, at 20, n. 6. Still, that point suggests only\nthat the admission of Lambatos\u2019s statement was harm-\nless\u2014that the judge managed to put it out of mind. After\nall, whether a factfinder is confused by an error is a sepa-\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     15\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nrate question from whether an error has occurred. So the\nplurality\u2019s argument does not answer the only question\nthis case presents: whether a constitutional violation\nhappened when Lambatos recited the Cellmark report\u2019s\nfindings.3\n   At bottom, the plurality\u2019s not-for-the-truth rationale is a\nsimple abdication to state-law labels. Although the utility\nof the Cellmark statement that Lambatos repeated logi-\ncally depended on its truth, the plurality thinks this case\ndecided by an Illinois rule holding that the facts underly-\ning an expert\u2019s opinion are not admitted for that purpose.\nSee ante, at 14\u201318; People v. Pasch, 152 Ill. 2d 133, 175\u2013\n177, 604 N. E. 2d 294, 311 (1992). But we do not typically\nallow state law to define federal constitutional require-\nments. And needless to say (or perhaps not), the Confron-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The plurality asserts (without citation) that I am \u201creach[ing] the\n\ntruly remarkable conclusion that the wording of Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nconfused the trial judge,\u201d ante, at 19, and then spends three pages\nexplaining why that conclusion is wrong, see ante, at 19\u201321. But the\nplurality is responding to an argument of its own imagining, because I\nreach no such conclusion. As I just stated, the trial judge might well\nhave ignored Lambatos\u2019s statement about the Cellmark report and\nrelied on other evidence to conclude that \u201cthe Cellmark profile was\nderived from the sample taken from the victim,\u201d ante, at 19. All I am\nsaying is that the admission of that statement violated the Confronta-\ntion Clause even if the judge ultimately put it aside, because it came\ninto evidence for nothing other than its truth. See supra, at 9\u201312.\n   Similarly, the plurality claims (still without citation) that I think the\nother evidence about the Cellmark report insufficient, see ante, at 21.\nBut once again, the plurality must be reading someone else\u2019s opinion. I\nexpress no view on sufficiency of the evidence because it is irrelevant to\nthe Confrontation Clause issue we took this case to decide. It is the\nplurality that wrongly links the two, spending another five pages\ntrumpeting the strength of the Cellmark report, see ante, at 22\u201324, 32\u2013\n33. But the plurality cannot properly decide whether a Confrontation\nClause violation occurred at Williams\u2019s trial by determining that\nWilliams was guilty. The American criminal justice system works the\nopposite way: determining guilt by holding trials in accord with consti-\ntutional requirements.\n16                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntation Clause is a constitutional rule like any other. As\nJUSTICE THOMAS observes, even before Crawford, we did\nnot allow the Clause\u2019s scope to be \u201cdictated by state or\nfederal evidentiary rules.\u201d See ante, at 2. Indeed, in\nStreet, we independently reviewed whether an out-of-court\nstatement was introduced for its truth\u2014the very question\nat issue in this case. See 471 U. S., at 413\u2013416. And in\nCrawford, we still more firmly disconnected the Confron-\ntation Clause inquiry from state evidence law, by overrul-\ning an approach that looked in part to whether an out-\nof-court statement fell within a \u201c \u2018firmly rooted hearsay\nexception.\u2019 \u201d 541 U. S., at 60 (quoting Roberts, 448 U. S., at\n66). That decision made clear that the Confrontation\nClause\u2019s protections are not coterminous with rules of\nevidence. So the plurality\u2019s state-law-first approach would\nbe an about-face.\n  Still worse, that approach would allow prosecutors to do\nthrough subterfuge and indirection what we previously\nhave held the Confrontation Clause prohibits. Imagine\nfor a moment a poorly trained, incompetent, or dishonest\nlaboratory analyst. (The analyst in Bullcoming, placed on\nunpaid leave for unknown reasons, might qualify.) Under\nour precedents, the prosecutor cannot avoid exposing that\nanalyst to cross-examination simply by introducing his\nreport. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 311. Nor can the\nprosecutor escape that fate by offering the results through\nthe testimony of another analyst from the laboratory. See\nBullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). But under\nthe plurality\u2019s approach, the prosecutor could choose the\nanalyst-witness of his dreams (as the judge here said, \u201cthe\nbest DNA witness I have ever heard\u201d), offer her as an\nexpert (she knows nothing about the test, but boasts im-\npressive degrees), and have her provide testimony identi-\ncal to the best the actual tester might have given (\u201cthe\nDNA extracted from the vaginal swabs matched Sandy\nWilliams\u2019s\u201d)\u2014all so long as a state evidence rule says that\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nthe purpose of the testimony is to enable the factfinder to\nassess the expert opinion\u2019s basis. (And this tactic would\nnot be confined to cases involving scientific evidence. As\nJUSTICE THOMAS points out, the prosecutor could similarly\nsubstitute experts for all kinds of people making out-of-\ncourt statements. See ante, at 7.) The plurality thus\nwould countenance the Constitution\u2019s circumvention. If\nthe Confrontation Clause prevents the State from getting\nits evidence in through the front door, then the State could\nsneak it in through the back. What a neat trick\u2014but\nreally, what a way to run a criminal justice system. No\nwonder five Justices reject it.\n                              III\n   The plurality also argues, as a \u201csecond, independent\nbasis\u201d for its decision, that the Cellmark report falls out-\nside the Confrontation Clause\u2019s ambit because it is nontes-\ntimonial. Ante, at 3. The plurality tries out a number of\nsupporting theories, but all in vain: Each one either con-\nflicts with this Court\u2019s precedents or misconstrues this\ncase\u2019s facts. JUSTICE THOMAS rejects the plurality\u2019s views\nfor similar reasons as I do, thus bringing to five the num-\nber of Justices who repudiate the plurality\u2019s understand-\ning of what statements count as testimonial. See ante, at\n1, 12\u201315. JUSTICE THOMAS, however, offers a rationale\nof his own for deciding that the Cellmark report is non-\ntestimonial. I think his essay works no better. When\nall is said and done, the Cellmark report is a testimonial\nstatement.\n                               A\n   According to the plurality, we should declare the\nCellmark report nontestimonial because \u201cthe use at trial\nof a DNA report prepared by a modern, accredited labora-\ntory \u2018bears little if any resemblance to the historical prac-\ntices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 33 (quoting Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n18                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n(2011) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at\n2)). But we just last year treated as testimonial a forensic\nreport prepared by a \u201cmodern, accredited laboratory\u201d;\nindeed, we declared that the report at issue \u201cfell within\nthe core class of testimonial statements\u201d implicating the\nConfrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Brief for\nNew Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory\nDivision as Amicus Curiae in Bullcoming, O. T. 2010, No.\n09\u201310786, p. 1 (discussing accreditation). And although\nthe plurality is close, it is not quite ready (or able) to\ndispense with that decision. See ante, at 29, n. 13 (\u201cExpe-\nrience might yet show that the holdings in [Bullcoming\nand other post-Crawford] cases should be reconsidered\u201d).\nSo the plurality must explain: What could support a dis-\ntinction between the laboratory analysis there and the\nDNA test in this case?4\n  As its first stab, the plurality states that the Cellmark\nreport was \u201cnot prepared for the primary purpose of accus-\ning a targeted individual.\u201d Ante, at 31. Where that test\ncomes from is anyone\u2019s guess. JUSTICE THOMAS rightly\nshows that it derives neither from the text nor from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 JUSTICE BREYER does not attempt to distinguish our precedents,\n\nopting simply to adhere to \u201cthe dissenting view set forth in Melendez-\nDiaz and Bullcoming.\u201d See ante, at 8 (concurring opinion). He princi-\npally worries that under those cases, a State will have to call to the\nwitness stand \u201c[s]ix to twelve or more technicians\u201d who have worked on\na report. See ante, at 5; see also ante, at 3, 16\u201318. But none of our\ncases\u2014including this one\u2014has presented the question of how many\nanalysts must testify about a given report. (That may suggest that in\nmost cases a lead analyst is readily identifiable.) The problem in the\ncases\u2014again, including this one\u2014is that no analyst came forward to\ntestify. In the event that some future case presents the multiple-\ntechnician issue, the Court can focus on \u201cthe broader \u2018limits\u2019 question\u201d\nthat troubles JUSTICE BREYER, ante, at 7. But the mere existence of\nthat question is no reason to wrongly decide the case before us\u2014which,\nit bears repeating, involved the testimony of not twelve or six or three\nor one, but zero Cellmark analysts.\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

And it has no basis in\nour precedents. We have previously asked whether a\nstatement was made for the primary purpose of establish-\ning \u201cpast events potentially relevant to later criminal\nprosecution\u201d\u2014in other words, for the purpose of providing\nevidence.

S., at 310\u2013\n311; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 51\u201352. None of our cases has\never suggested that, in addition, the statement must be\nmeant to accuse a previously identified individual; indeed,\nin Melendez-Diaz, we rejected a related argument that\nlaboratory \u201canalysts are not subject to confrontation be-\ncause they are not \u2018accusatory\u2019 witnesses.\u201d 557 U. S., at\n313.\n   Nor does the plurality give any good reason for adopting\nan \u201caccusation\u201d test. The plurality apparently agrees with\nJUSTICE BREYER that prior to a suspect\u2019s identification,\nit will be \u201cunlikely that a particular researcher has a\ndefendant-related motive to behave dishonestly.\u201d Ante, at 12\n(BREYER, J., concurring); see ante, at 31\u201332 (plurality\nopinion). But surely the typical problem with laboratory\nanalyses\u2014and the typical focus of cross-examination\u2014has\nto do with careless or incompetent work, rather than with\npersonal vendettas. And as to that predominant concern,\nit makes not a whit of difference whether, at the time of\nthe laboratory test, the police already have a suspect.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Neither can the plurality gain any purchase from the idea that a\nDNA profile is not \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d because it \u201ctends to excul-\npate all but one of the more than 7 billion people in the world today.\u201d\nAnte, at 3; see ante, at 32. All evidence shares this feature: the more\ninculpatory it is of a single person, the more exculpatory it is of the rest\nof the world. The one is but the flipside of the other. But no one has\never before suggested that this logical corollary provides a reason to\nignore the Constitution\u2019s efforts to ensure the reliability of evidence.\n20                   WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   The plurality next attempts to invoke our precedents\nholding statements nontestimonial when made \u201cto respond\nto an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 \u201d rather than to create evidence\nfor trial, Bryant, 562 U.

But that is to stretch both our \u201congoing emergency\u201d\ntest and the facts of this case beyond all recognition. We\nhave previously invoked that test to allow statements by a\nwoman who was being assaulted and a man who had just\nbeen shot. In doing so, we stressed the \u201cinformal [and]\nharried\u201d nature of the statements, Bryant, 562 U.

On their face,\nthe decisions have nothing to say about laboratory ana-\nlysts conducting routine tests far away from a crime scene.\nAnd this case presents a peculiarly inapt set of facts\nfor extending those precedents. Lambatos testified at trial\nthat \u201call reports in this case were prepared for this crimi-\nnal investigation . . . [a]nd for the purpose of the eventual\nlitigation,\u201d App. 82\u2014in other words, for the purpose of\nproducing evidence, not enabling emergency responders.\nAnd that testimony fits the relevant timeline. The police\ndid not send the swabs to Cellmark until November\n2008\u2014nine months after L. J.\u2019s rape\u2014and did not receive\nthe results for another four months. See id., at 30\u201334, 51\u2013\n52, 54.

Consider what Lambatos told the factfinder here:\nThe DNA in L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs matched Williams\u2019s DNA and would\nmatch only \u201c1 in 8.7 quadrillion black, 1 in 390 quadrillion white, or\n1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic unrelated individuals.\u201d App. 56\u201357. No\neyewitness testimony could replace that evidence. I note as well that\nthe Innocence Network\u2014a group particularly knowledgeable about the\n22                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   And Melendez-Diaz made yet a more fundamental point\nin response to claims of the \u00fcber alles reliability of scien-\ntific evidence: It is not up to us to decide, ex ante, what\nevidence is trustworthy and what is not. See 557 U. S., at\n317\u2013318; see also Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11). That is because the Confrontation Clause prescribes\nits own \u201cprocedure for determining the reliability of testi-\nmony in criminal trials.\u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 67. That\nprocedure is cross-examination. And \u201c[d]ispensing with\n[it] because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dis-\npensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously\nguilty.\u201d Id., at 62.\n   So the plurality\u2019s second basis for denying Williams\u2019s\nright of confrontation also fails. The plurality can find no\nreason consistent with our precedents for treating the\nCellmark report as nontestimonial. That is because the\nreport is, in every conceivable respect, a statement meant\nto serve as evidence in a potential criminal trial. And that\nsimple fact should be sufficient to resolve the question.\n                             B\n   JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s unique method of defining testimo-\nnial statements fares no better. On his view, the Con-\nfrontation Clause \u201cregulates only the use of statements\nbearing \u2018indicia of solemnity.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting Davis,\n547 U. S., at 836\u2013837). And Cellmark\u2019s report, he con-\ncludes, does not qualify because it is \u201cneither a sworn nor a\ncertified declaration of fact.\u201d Ante, at 9. But JUSTICE\nTHOMAS\u2019s approach grants constitutional significance to\nminutia, in a way that can only undermine the Confronta-\ntion Clause\u2019s protections.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nkinds of evidence that produce erroneous convictions\u2014disagrees with\nthe plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s view. It argues here that \u201c[c]on-\nfrontation of the analyst . . . is essential to permit proper adversarial\ntesting\u201d and so to decrease the risk of convicting the innocent.

In Bullcoming, the State asserted that\nthe forensic report at issue was nontestimonial because\u2014\nunlike the report in Melendez-Diaz\u2014it was not sworn\nbefore a notary public. We responded that applying the\nConfrontation Clause only to a sworn forensic report\n\u201cwould make the right to confrontation easily erasable\u201d\u2014\nnext time, the laboratory could file the selfsame report\nwithout the oath. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). We\nthen held, as noted earlier, that \u201c[i]n all material re-\nspects,\u201d the forensic report in Bullcoming matched the one\nin Melendez-Diaz. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15); see\nsupra, at 5. First, a law enforcement officer provided\nevidence to a state laboratory assisting in police investiga-\ntions. See 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Second, the\nanalyst tested the evidence and \u201cprepared a certificate\nconcerning the result[s].\u201d Ibid. Third, the certificate was\n\u201cformalized in a signed document . . . headed a \u2018report.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (some internal quotation marks omitted). That was\nenough.\n   Now compare that checklist of \u201cmaterial\u201d features to the\nreport in this case. The only differences are that Cellmark\nis a private laboratory under contract with the State\n(which no one thinks relevant), and that the report is not\nlabeled a \u201ccertificate.\u201d That amounts to (maybe) a nickel\u2019s\nworth of difference: The similarities in form, function, and\npurpose dwarf the distinctions. See supra, at 5\u20136. Each\nreport is an official and signed record of laboratory test\nresults, meant to establish a certain set of facts in legal\nproceedings. Neither looks any more \u201cformal\u201d than the\nother; neither is any more formal than the other. See ibid.\nThe variances are no more (probably less) than would be\nfound if you compared different law schools\u2019 transcripts\nor different companies\u2019 cash flow statements or different\n24                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nStates\u2019 birth certificates. The difference in labeling\u2014a\n\u201ccertificate\u201d in one case, a \u201creport of laboratory examina-\ntion\u201d in the other\u2014is not of constitutional dimension.\n   Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s approach, if accepted, would\nturn the Confrontation Clause into a constitutional gee-\ngaw\u2014nice for show, but of little value. The prosecution\ncould avoid its demands by using the right kind of forms\nwith the right kind of language. (It would not take long to\ndevise the magic words and rules\u2014principally, never call\nanything a \u201ccertificate.\u201d)7 And still worse: The new con-\nventions, precisely by making out-of-court statements less\n\u201csolem[n],\u201d ante, at 1, would also make them less relia-\nble\u2014and so turn the Confrontation Clause upside down.\nSee Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\u201353, n. 3 (\u201cWe find it im-\nplausible that a provision which concededly condemned\ntrial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn\nex parte affidavit perfectly OK\u201d). It is not surprising that\nno other Member of the Court has adopted this position.\nTo do so, as JUSTICE THOMAS rightly says of the plurality\u2019s\ndecision, would be to \u201cdiminis[h] the Confrontation\nClause\u2019s protection\u201d in \u201cthe very cases in which the ac-\ncused should \u2018enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 16.\n                             IV\n   Before today\u2019s decision, a prosecutor wishing to admit\nthe results of forensic testing had to produce the techni-\ncian responsible for the analysis. That was the result of\nnot one, but two decisions this Court issued in the last\nthree years. But that clear rule is clear no longer. The\nfive Justices who control the outcome of today\u2019s case agree\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE THOMAS asserts there is no need to worry, because \u201cthe\n\nConfrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the formal-\nized process.\u201d Ante, at 10; see ante, at 9, n. 5. I hope he is right. But\nJUSTICE THOMAS provides scant guidance on how to conduct this novel\ninquiry into motive.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          25\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\non very little. Among them, though, they can boast of two\naccomplishments. First, they have approved the introduc-\ntion of testimony at Williams\u2019s trial that the Confrontation\nClause, rightly understood, clearly prohibits. Second, they\nhave left significant confusion in their wake. What\ncomes out of four Justices\u2019 desire to limit Melendez-Diaz\nand Bullcoming in whatever way possible, combined with\none Justice\u2019s one-justice view of those holdings, is\u2014to be\nfrank\u2014who knows what. Those decisions apparently no\nlonger mean all that they say. Yet no one can tell in what\nway or to what extent they are altered because no pro-\nposed limitation commands the support of a majority.\n   The better course in this case would have been simply to\nfollow Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Precedent-based\ndecisionmaking provides guidance to lower court judges\nand predictability to litigating parties. Today\u2019s plurality\nand concurring opinions, and the uncertainty they sow,\nbring into relief that judicial method\u2019s virtues. I would\ndecide this case consistently with, and for the reasons\nstated by, Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. And until a\nmajority of this Court reverses or confines those decisions,\nI would understand them as continuing to govern, in every\nparticular, the admission of forensic evidence.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

ILLINOIS\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS\n\n    No. 10\u20138505. Argued December 6, 2011\u2014Decided June 18, 2012\nAt petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, Sandra Lambatos, a forensic spe-\n  cialist at the Illinois State Police lab, testified that she matched a\n  DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, to a profile\n  the state lab produced using a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood. She testi-\n  fied that Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that business\n  records showed that vaginal swabs taken from the victim, L. J., were\n  sent to Cellmark and returned. She offered no other statement for\n  the purpose of identifying the sample used for Cellmark\u2019s profile or\n  establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample. Nor did\n  she vouch for the accuracy of Cellmark\u2019s profile. The defense moved\n  to exclude, on Confrontation Clause grounds, Lambatos\u2019 testimony\n  insofar as it implicated events at Cellmark, but the prosecution said\n  that petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights were satisfied because he had\n  the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who had testified as to\n  the match. The prosecutor argued that Illinois Rule of Evidence 703\n  permitted an expert to disclose facts on which the expert\u2019s opinion is\n  based even if the expert is not competent to testify to those underly-\n  ing facts, and that any deficiency went to the weight of the evidence,\n  not its admissibility. The trial court admitted the evidence and found\n  petitioner guilty. Both the Illinois Court of Appeals and the State\n  Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Lambatos\u2019 testimony did\n  not violate petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights because Cellmark\u2019s report\n  was not offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter\n  asserted.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ill/dHc9/people-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 939 N.

Pp. 10\u201333.\n2                         WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Before Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, this Court took\n    the view that the Confrontation Clause did not bar the admission of\n    out-of-court statements that fell within a firmly rooted exception to\n    the hearsay rule. In Crawford, the Court held that such statements\n    could be \u201cadmitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only\n    where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d\n    Id., at 59. In both Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305,\n    and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U. S. ___, two of the many cases\n    that have arisen from Crawford, this Court ruled that scientific re-\n    ports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant\n    unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject\n    to confrontation. In each case, the report at issue \u201ccontain[ed] a tes-\n    timonial certification, made in order to prove a fact at a criminal\n    trial.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___. Here, in contrast, the question is the\n    constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss others\u2019\n    testimonial statements if those statements are not themselves admit-\n    ted as evidence. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (b) An expert witness may voice an opinion based on facts concern-\n    ing the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge\n    of those facts. A long tradition in American courts permits an expert\n    to testify in the form of a \u201chypothetical question,\u201d where the expert\n    assumes the truth of factual predicates and then offers testimony\n    based on those assumptions. See Forsyth v. Doolittle, 120 U. S. 73,\n    77. Modern evidence rules dispense with the need for hypothetical\n    questions and permit an expert to base an opinion on facts \u201cmade\n    known to the expert at or before the hearing,\u201d though such reliance\n    does not constitute admissible evidence of the underlying infor-\n    mation. Ill. Rule Evid. 703; Fed. Rule Evid. 703. Both Illinois and\n    Federal Rules bar an expert from disclosing the inadmissible evi-\n    dence in jury trials but not in bench trials. This is important because\n    Crawford, while departing from prior Confrontation Clause precedent\n    in other respects, reaffirmed the proposition that the Clause \u201cdoes\n    not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than es-\n    tablishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d 541 U. S., at 59, n. 9.\n    Pp. 13\u201316.\n       (c) For Confrontation Clause purposes, the references to Cellmark\n    in the trial record either were not hearsay or were not offered for the\n    truth of the matter asserted. Pp. 16\u201327.\n          (1) Petitioner\u2019s confrontation right was not violated when Lam-\n    batos answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question about whether there was a match\n    between the DNA profile \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of\n    [L. J.]\u201d and the one identified as petitioner\u2019s. Under Illinois law, this\n    putatively offending phrase was not admissible for the purpose of\n    proving the truth of the matter asserted\u2014i.e., that the matching\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nDNA profile was \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs.\u201d Rather,\nthat fact was a mere premise of the prosecutor\u2019s question, and Lam-\nbatos simply assumed it to be true in giving her answer. Because\nthis was a bench trial, the Court assumes that the trial judge under-\nstood that the testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted. It is also unlikely that the judge took the testimony\nas providing chain-of-custody evidence. The record does not support\nsuch an understanding; no trial judge is likely to be so confused; and\nthe admissible evidence left little room for argument that Cellmark\u2019s\nsample came from any source but L. J.\u2019s swabs, since the profile\nmatched the very man she identified in a lineup and at trial as her\nattacker. Pp. 16\u201321.\n     (2) Nor did the substance of Cellmark\u2019s report need to be intro-\nduced in order to show that Cellmark\u2019s profile was based on the se-\nmen in L. J.\u2019s swabs or that its procedures were reliable. The issue\nhere is whether petitioner\u2019s confrontation right was violated, not\nwhether the State offered sufficient foundational evidence to support\nthe admission of Lambatos\u2019 opinion. If there were no proof that\nCellmark\u2019s profile was accurate, Lambatos\u2019 testimony would be irrel-\nevant, but the Confrontation Clause bars not the admission of irrele-\nvant evidence, but the admission of testimonial statements by de-\nclarants who are not subject to cross-examination. Here, the trial\nrecord does not lack admissible evidence with respect to the source of\nthe sample tested by Cellmark or the reliability of its profile. The\nState offered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, and the match\nbetween Cellmark\u2019s profile and petitioner\u2019s was telling confirmation\nthat Cellmark\u2019s profile was deduced from the semen on L. J.\u2019s swabs.\nThe match also provided strong circumstantial evidence about the re-\nliability of Cellmark\u2019s work. Pp. 21\u201325.\n     (3) This conclusion is consistent with Bullcoming and Melendez-\nDiaz, where forensic reports were introduced for the purpose of prov-\ning the truth of what they asserted. In contrast, Cellmark\u2019s report\nwas considered for the limited purpose of seeing whether it matched\nsomething else, and the relevance of that match was established by\nindependent circumstantial evidence showing that the report was\nbased on a sample from the crime scene. There are at least four safe-\nguards to prevent abuses in such situations. First, trial courts can\nscreen out experts who would act as conduits for hearsay by strictly\nenforcing the requirement that experts display genuine \u201cscientific,\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d to help the trier of fact un-\nderstand the evidence or determine a fact at issue. Fed. Rule Evid.\n702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded from disclosing in-\nadmissible evidence to a jury. Third, if such evidence is disclosed, a\ntrial judge may instruct the jury that the statements cannot be ac-\n4                        WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cepted for their truth, and that an expert\u2019s opinion is only as good as\n    the independent evidence establishing its underlying premises.\n    Fourth, if the prosecution cannot muster independent admissible evi-\n    dence to prove foundational facts, the expert\u2019s testimony cannot be\n    given weight by the trier of fact. Pp. 25\u201327.\n         (e) Even if Cellmark\u2019s report had been introduced for its truth,\n    there would have been no Confrontation Clause violation. The\n    Clause refers to testimony by \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused, prohib-\n    iting modern-day practices that are tantamount to the abuses that\n    gave rise to the confrontation right, namely, (a) out-of-court state-\n    ments having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual\n    of engaging in criminal conduct, and (b) formalized statements such\n    as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions. These\n    characteristics were present in every post-Crawford case in which a\n    Confrontation Clause violation has been found, except for Hammon v.\n    Indiana, 547 U. S. 813. But, even in Hammon, the particular state-\n    ment, elicited during police interrogation, had the primary purpose of\n    accusing a targeted individual. A person who makes a statement to\n    resolve an ongoing emergency is not like a trial witness because the\n    declarant\u2019s purpose is to bring an end to an ongoing threat. Michigan\n    v. Bryant, 562 U. S. ___, ___. Such a statement\u2019s admissibility \u201cis the\n    concern of . . . rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause. \u201d Id.,\n    ___\u2013___ . The forensic reports in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming ran\n    afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they were the equivalent of\n    affidavits made for the purpose of proving a particular criminal de-\n    fendant\u2019s guilt. But the Cellmark report\u2019s primary purpose was to\n    catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence\n    for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under sus-\n    picion at that time. Nor could anyone at Cellmark possibly know\n    that the profile would inculpate petitioner. There was thus no \u201cpro-\n    spect of fabrication\u201d and no incentive to produce anything other than\n    a scientifically sound and reliable profile. Bryant, supra, at ___, ___.\n    Lab technicians producing a DNA profile generally have no way of\n    knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminating, exonerating, or\n    both. And with numerous technicians working on a profile, it is like-\n    ly that each technician\u2019s sole purpose is to perform a task in accord-\n    ance with accepted procedures. The knowledge that defects in a DNA\n    profile may be detected from the profile itself provides a further safe-\n    guard. Pp. 28\u201333.\n       JUSTICE THOMAS concluded that the disclosure of Cellmark\u2019s out-of-\n    court statements through Lambatos\u2019 expert testimony did not violate\n    the Confrontation Clause solely because Cellmark\u2019s statements\n    lacked the requisite \u201cformality and solemnity\u201d to be considered \u201c \u2018tes-\n    timonial,\u2019 \u201d see Michigan v.

Pp. 1\u201316.\n   (a) There was no plausible reason for the introduction of Cellmark\u2019s\nstatements other than to establish their truth. Pp. 1\u20138.\n     (1) Illinois Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base his\nopinion on facts about which he lacks personal knowledge and to dis-\nclose those facts to the trier of fact. Under Illinois law, such facts are\nnot admitted for their truth, but only to explain the basis of the ex-\npert\u2019s opinion. See People v. Pasch, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ill/brKb/people-v-pasch/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. But state evi-\ndence rules do not trump a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to con-\nfrontation. This Court ensures that an out-of-court statement was\nintroduced for a \u201clegitimate, nonhearsay purpose\u201d before relying on\nthe not-for-its-truth rationale to dismiss the Confrontation Clause\u2019s\napplication. See Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 417. Statements\nintroduced to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion are not intro-\nduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose because, to use the basis\ntestimony in evaluating the expert\u2019s opinion, the factfinder must con-\nsider the truth of the basis testimony. This commonsense conclusion\nis not undermined by any historical practice exempting expert basis\ntestimony from the rigors of the Confrontation Clause. Before the\nFederal Rules of Evidence were adopted in 1975, an expert could ren-\nder an opinion based only on facts that the expert had personally per-\nceived or learned at trial. In 1975, that universe of facts was ex-\npanded to include facts that the expert learned out of court by means\nother than his own perception. The disclosure of such facts raises\nConfrontation Clause concerns. Pp. 2\u20135.\n     (2) Those concerns are fully applicable here. In concluding that\npetitioner\u2019s DNA profile matched the profile derived from L. J.\u2019s\nswabs, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\u2019s out-of-court statements that\nits profile was in fact derived from those swabs, rather than from\nsome other source. Thus, the validity of Lambatos\u2019 opinion ultimate-\nly turned on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statements.

Washing-\nton, 541 U. S. 36, 50 (2004), precludes an expert witness\nfrom testifying in a manner that has long been allowed\nunder the law of evidence. Specifically, does Crawford bar\nan expert from expressing an opinion based on facts about\na case that have been made known to the expert but about\nwhich the expert is not competent to testify? We also\ndecide whether Crawford substantially impedes the ability\nof prosecutors to introduce DNA evidence and thus may\neffectively relegate the prosecution in some cases to reli-\nance on older, less reliable forms of proof.\n   In petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, the prosecution\ncalled an expert who testified that a DNA profile produced\nby an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile\nproduced by the state police lab using a sample of peti-\ntioner\u2019s blood. On direct examination, the expert testified\nthat Cellmark was an accredited laboratory and that\nCellmark provided the police with a DNA profile. The\nexpert also explained the notations on documents admit-\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nted as business records, stating that, according to the\nrecords, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to\nand received back from Cellmark. The expert made no\nother statement that was offered for the purpose of identi-\nfying the sample of biological material used in deriving\nthe profile or for the purpose of establishing how Cellmark\nhandled or tested the sample. Nor did the expert vouch\nfor the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark produced.\nNevertheless, petitioner contends that the expert\u2019s testi-\nmony violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in\nCrawford.\n   Petitioner\u2019s main argument is that the expert went\nastray when she referred to the DNA profile provided by\nCellmark as having been produced from semen found on\nthe victim\u2019s vaginal swabs. But both the Illinois Appellate\nCourt and the Illinois Supreme Court found that this\nstatement was not admitted for the truth of the matter\nasserted, and it is settled that the Confrontation Clause\ndoes not bar the admission of such statements. See id., at\n59\u201360, n. 9 (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409\n(1985)). For more than 200 years, the law of evidence has\npermitted the sort of testimony that was given by the ex-\npert in this case. Under settled evidence law, an expert\nmay express an opinion that is based on facts that the\nexpert assumes, but does not know, to be true. It is then\nup to the party who calls the expert to introduce other\nevidence establishing the facts assumed by the expert.\nWhile it was once the practice for an expert who based\nan opinion on assumed facts to testify in the form of an an-\nswer to a hypothetical question, modern practice does not\ndemand this formality and, in appropriate cases, permits\nan expert to explain the facts on which his or her opinion\nis based without testifying to the truth of those facts. See\nFed. Rule Evid. 703. That is precisely what occurred in\nthis case, and we should not lightly \u201cswee[p] away an\naccepted rule governing the admission of scientific evi-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ndence.\u201d Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305,\n330 (2009) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   We now conclude that this form of expert testimony does\nnot violate the Confrontation Clause because that provi-\nsion has no application to out-of-court statements that\nare not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\nWhen an expert testifies for the prosecution in a criminal\ncase, the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine\nthe expert about any statements that are offered for their\ntruth. Out-of-court statements that are related by the\nexpert solely for the purpose of explaining the assump-\ntions on which that opinion rests are not offered for their\ntruth and thus fall outside the scope of the Confrontation\nClause. Applying this rule to the present case, we con-\nclude that the expert\u2019s testimony did not violate the Sixth\nAmendment.\n   As a second, independent basis for our decision, we also\nconclude that even if the report produced by Cellmark had\nbeen admitted into evidence, there would have been no\nConfrontation Clause violation. The Cellmark report is\nvery different from the sort of extrajudicial statements,\nsuch as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and con-\nfessions, that the Confrontation Clause was originally\nunderstood to reach. The report was produced before any\nsuspect was identified. The report was sought not for the\npurpose of obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner,\nwho was not even under suspicion at the time, but for\nthe purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose. And\nthe profile that Cellmark provided was not inherently\ninculpatory. On the contrary, a DNA profile is evidence\nthat tends to exculpate all but one of the more than 7\nbillion people in the world today. The use of DNA evi-\ndence to exonerate persons who have been wrongfully\naccused or convicted is well known. If DNA profiles could\nnot be introduced without calling the technicians who\nparticipated in the preparation of the profile, economic\n4                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\npressures would encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA\ntesting and rely instead on older forms of evidence, such\nas eyewitness identification, that are less reliable. See\nPerry v. New Hampshire, 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The Con-\nfrontation Clause does not mandate such an undesirable\ndevelopment. This conclusion will not prejudice any de-\nfendant who really wishes to probe the reliability of the\nDNA testing done in a particular case because those who\nparticipated in the testing may always be subpoenaed by\nthe defense and questioned at trial.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  On February 10, 2000, in Chicago, Illinois, a young\nwoman, L. J., was abducted while she was walking home\nfrom work. The perpetrator forced her into his car and\nraped her, then robbed her of her money and other per-\nsonal items and pushed her out into the street. L. J. ran\nhome and reported the attack to her mother, who called\nthe police. An ambulance took L. J. to the hospital, where\ndoctors treated her wounds and took a blood sample and\nvaginal swabs for a sexual-assault kit. A Chicago Police\ndetective collected the kit, labeled it with an inventory\nnumber, and sent it under seal to the Illinois State Police\n(ISP) lab.\n  At the ISP lab, a forensic scientist received the sealed\nkit. He conducted a chemical test that confirmed the\npresence of semen on the vaginal swabs, and he then\nresealed the kit and placed it in a secure evidence freezer.\n  During the period in question, the ISP lab often sent\nbiological samples to Cellmark Diagnostics Laboratory in\nGermantown, Maryland, for DNA testing. There was\nevidence that the ISP lab sent L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs to\nCellmark for testing and that Cellmark sent back a report\ncontaining a male DNA profile produced from semen taken\nfrom those swabs. At this time, petitioner was not under\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nsuspicion for L. J.\u2019s rape.\n   Sandra Lambatos, a forensic specialist at the ISP lab,\nconducted a computer search to see if the Cellmark profile\nmatched any of the entries in the state DNA database.\nThe computer showed a match to a profile produced by the\nlab from a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood that had been taken\nafter he was arrested on unrelated charges on August 3,\n2000.\n   On April 17, 2001, the police conducted a lineup at\nwhich L. J. identified petitioner as her assailant. Peti-\ntioner was then indicted for aggravated criminal sexual\nassault, aggravated kidnaping, and aggravated robbery.\nIn lieu of a jury trial, petitioner chose to be tried before a\nstate judge.\n                              B\n   Petitioner\u2019s bench trial began in April 2006. In open\ncourt, L. J. again identified petitioner as her attacker.\nThe State also offered three expert forensic witnesses to\nlink petitioner to the crime through his DNA. First, Brian\nHapack, an ISP forensic scientist, testified that he had\nconfirmed the presence of semen on the vaginal swabs\ntaken from L. J. by performing an acid phosphatase test.\nAfter performing this test, he testified, he resealed the\nevidence and left it in a secure freezer at the ISP lab.\n   Second, Karen Abbinanti, a state forensic analyst, testi-\nfied that she had used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\nand Short Tandem Repeat (STR) techniques to develop a\nDNA profile from a blood sample that had been drawn\nfrom petitioner after he was arrested in August 2000. She\nalso stated that she had entered petitioner\u2019s DNA profile\ninto the state forensic database.\n   Third, the State offered Sandra Lambatos as an expert\nwitness in forensic biology and forensic DNA analysis. On\ndirect examination, Lambatos testified about the general\nprocess of using the PCR and STR techniques to generate\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nDNA profiles from forensic samples such as blood and\nsemen. She then described how these DNA profiles could\nbe matched to an individual based on the individual\u2019s\nunique genetic code. In making a comparison between two\nDNA profiles, Lambatos stated, it is a \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d\npractice within the scientific community for \u201cone DNA\nexpert to rely on the records of another DNA expert.\u201d App.\n51. Lambatos also testified that Cellmark was an \u201caccred-\nited crime lab\u201d and that, in her experience, the ISP lab\nroutinely sent evidence samples via Federal Express to\nCellmark for DNA testing in order to expedite the testing\nprocess and to \u201creduce [the lab\u2019s] backlog.\u201d Id., at 49\u201350.\nTo keep track of evidence samples and preserve the chain\nof custody, Lambatos stated, she and other analysts relied\non sealed shipping containers and labeled shipping mani-\nfests, and she added that experts in her field regularly\nrelied on such protocols. Id., at 50\u201351.\n   Lambatos was shown shipping manifests that were\nadmitted into evidence as business records, and she ex-\nplained what they indicated, namely, that the ISP lab had\nsent L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs to Cellmark, and that Cellmark\nhad sent them back, along with a deduced male DNA\nprofile. Id., at 52\u201355. The prosecutor asked Lambatos\nwhether there was \u201ca computer match\u201d between \u201cthe male\nDNA profile found in semen from the vaginal swabs of\n[L. J.]\u201d and \u201c[the] male DNA profile that had been identi-\nfied\u201d from petitioner\u2019s blood sample. Id., at 55.\n   The defense attorney objected to this question for \u201clack\nof foundation,\u201d arguing that the prosecution had offered\n\u201cno evidence with regard to any testing that\u2019s been done to\ngenerate a DNA profile by another lab to be testified to by\nthis witness.\u201d Ibid.\n   The prosecutor responded: \u201cI\u2018m not getting at what\nanother lab did.\u201d Id., at 56. Rather, she said, she was\nsimply asking Lambatos about \u201cher own testing based on\n[DNA] information\u201d that she had received from Cellmark.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nIbid. The trial judge agreed, noting, \u201cIf she says she didn\u2019t\ndo her own testing and she relied on a test of another lab\nand she\u2019s testifying to that, we will see what she\u2019s going to\nsay.\u201d Ibid.\n   The prosecutor then proceeded, asking Lambatos, \u201cDid\nyou compare the semen that had been identified by Brian\nHapack from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.] to the male DNA\nprofile that had been identified by Karen [Abbinanti] from\nthe blood of [petitioner]?\u201d Ibid.\n   Lambatos answered \u201cYes.\u201d Ibid. Defense counsel\nlodged an objection \u201cto the form of the question,\u201d but the\ntrial judge overruled it. Ibid. Lambatos then testified\nthat, based on her own comparison of the two DNA pro-\nfiles, she \u201cconcluded that [petitioner] cannot be excluded\nas a possible source of the semen identified in the vaginal\nswabs,\u201d and that the probability of the profile\u2019s appearing\nin the general population was \u201c1 in 8.7 quadrillion black,\n1 in 390 quadrillion white, or 1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic\nunrelated individuals.\u201d Id., at 57. Asked whether she\nwould \u201ccall this a match to [petitioner],\u201d Lambatos an-\nswered yes, again over defense counsel\u2019s objection. Id.,\nat 58.\n   The Cellmark report itself was neither admitted into\nevidence nor shown to the factfinder. Lambatos did not\nquote or read from the report; nor did she identify it as the\nsource of any of the opinions she expressed.\n   On cross-examination, Lambatos confirmed that she did\nnot conduct or observe any of the testing on the vaginal\nswabs, and that her testimony relied on the DNA profile\nproduced by Cellmark. Id., at 59. She stated that she\ntrusted Cellmark to do reliable work because it was an\naccredited lab, but she admitted she had not seen any of\nthe calibrations or work that Cellmark had done in deduc-\ning a male DNA profile from the vaginal swabs. Id., at\n59\u201362.\n   Asked whether the DNA sample might have been de-\n8                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                        Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ngraded before Cellmark analyzed it, Lambatos answered\nthat, while degradation was technically possible, she\nstrongly doubted it had occurred in this case. She gave\ntwo reasons. First, the ISP lab likely would have noticed\nthe degradation before sending the evidence off to Cell-\nmark. Second, and more important, Lambatos also noted\nthat the data making up the DNA profile would ex-\nhibit certain telltale signs if it had been deduced from a\ndegraded sample: The visual representation of the DNA\nsequence would exhibit \u201cspecific patterns\u201d of degradation,\nand she \u201cdidn\u2019t see any evidence\u201d of that from looking at\nthe profile that Cellmark produced. Id., at 81\u201382.\n   When Lambatos finished testifying, the defense moved\nto exclude her testimony \u201cwith regards to testing done by\n[Cellmark]\u201d based on the Confrontation Clause. Id., at 90.\nDefense counsel argued that there was \u201cno evidence with\nregards to . . . any work done by [Cellmark] to justify\ntestimony coming into this case with regard to their anal-\nysis.\u201d Ibid. Thus, while defense counsel objected to and\nsought the exclusion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony insofar as it\nimplicated events at the Cellmark lab, defense counsel did\nnot object to or move for the exclusion of any other portion\nof Lambatos\u2019 testimony, including statements regarding\nthe contents of the shipment sent to or received back from\nCellmark.

The state court of appeals affirmed in rele-\nvant part, concluding that Lambatos\u2019 testimony did not\nviolate petitioner\u2019s confrontation rights because the Cell-\nmark report was not offered into evidence to prove the truth\nof the matter it asserted.

Roberts,\n448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980), but in Crawford, the Court adopted\na fundamentally new interpretation of the confronta-\ntion right, holding that \u201c[t]estimonial statements of wit-\nnesses absent from trial [can be] admitted only where the\ndeclarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant\nhas had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d 541 U.

An expert could rely on facts that had\nalready been established in the record. But because it was\nnot always possible to proceed in this manner, and be-\ncause record evidence was often disputed, courts devel-\noped the alternative practice of allowing an expert to\ntestify in the form of a \u201chypothetical question.\u201d Under this\napproach, the expert would be asked to assume the truth\nof certain factual predicates, and was then asked to offer\nan opinion based on those assumptions. See 1 K. Broun,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a714, p. 87 (6th ed. 2006); 1\nJ. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7677, p. 1084 (2d ed. 1923) (\u201cIf the\nwitness is skilled enough, his opinion may be adequately\nobtained upon hypothetical data alone; and it is immate-\nrial whether he has ever seen the person, place or thing in\nquestion\u201d (citation omitted)). The truth of the premises\ncould then be established through independent evidence,\nand the factfinder would regard the expert\u2019s testimony to\nbe only as credible as the premises on which it was based.\n   An early example of this approach comes from the Eng-\nlish case of Beckwith v. Sydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170\nEng. Rep. 897 (K. B. 1807), where a party sought to prove\nthe seaworthiness of a ship, the Earl of Wycombe, by\ncalling as witnesses \u201cseveral eminent surveyors of ships\nwho had never seen the \u2018Earl of Wycombe.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The\nopposing party objected to the testimony because it relied\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\non facts that were not known to be true, but the judge\ndisagreed. Because the experts were \u201cpeculiarly ac-\nquainted\u201d with \u201ca matter of skill or science,\u201d the judge\nsaid, the \u201cjury might be assisted\u201d by their hypothetical\nopinion based on certain assumed facts. Id., at 117, 170 Eng.\nRep., at 897. The judge acknowledged the danger of the\njury\u2019s being unduly prejudiced by wrongly assuming the\ntruth of the hypothetical facts, but the judge noted that\nthe experts could be asked on cross-examination what\ntheir opinion of the ship\u2019s seaworthiness would be if differ-\nent hypothetical facts were assumed. If the party that had\ncalled the experts could not independently prove the truth\nof the premises they posited, then the experts\u2019 \u201copinion\nmight not go for much; but still it was admissible evi-\ndence.\u201d Ibid.\n   There is a long tradition of the use of hypothetical ques-\ntions in American courts. In 1887, for example, this Court\nindicated its approval of the following jury instruction:\n        \u201cAs to the questions, you must understand that they\n     are not evidence; they are mere statements to these\n     witnesses . . . and, upon the hypothesis or assumption\n     of these questions the witnesses are asked to give\n     their [opinion]. You must readily see that the value of\n     the answers to these questions depends largely, if not\n     wholly, upon the fact whether the statements made in\n     these questions are sustained by the proof. If the\n     statements in these questions are not supported by\n     the proof, then the answers to the questions are enti-\n     tled to no weight, because based upon false assump-\n     tions or statements of facts.\u201d Forsyth v. Doolittle, 120\n     U. S. 73, 77 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Modern rules of evidence continue to permit experts to\nexpress opinions based on facts about which they lack\npersonal knowledge, but these rules dispense with the\nneed for hypothetical questions.

Accordingly, in jury\ntrials, both Illinois and federal law generally bar an expert\nfrom disclosing such inadmissible evidence.2 In bench\ntrials, however, both the Illinois and the Federal Rules\nplace no restriction on the revelation of such information\nto the factfinder.

Although the accom-\nplice\u2019s confession was clearly a testimonial statement, the\nCourt held that the jurors could hear it as long as they\nwere instructed to consider that confession not for its\ntruth, but only for the \u201cdistinctive and limited purpose\u201d of\ncomparing it to the defendant\u2019s confession, to see whether\nthe two were identical.

She testified to the\ntruth of the following matters: Cellmark was an accredited\nlab, App. 49; the ISP occasionally sent forensic samples to\nCellmark for DNA testing, ibid.; according to shipping\nmanifests admitted into evidence, the ISP lab sent vaginal\nswabs taken from the victim to Cellmark and later re-\nceived those swabs back from Cellmark, id., at 52\u201355; and,\nfinally, the Cellmark DNA profile matched a profile pro-\nduced by the ISP lab from a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood,\nid., at 55\u201356. Lambatos had personal knowledge of all\nof these matters, and therefore none of this testimony in-\nfringed petitioner\u2019s confrontation right.\n   Lambatos did not testify to the truth of any other matter\nconcerning Cellmark. She made no other reference to the\nCellmark report, which was not admitted into evidence\nand was not seen by the trier of fact. Nor did she testify to\nanything that was done at the Cellmark lab, and she did\nnot vouch for the quality of Cellmark\u2019s work.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012) \n        17\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J. \n\n\n                               B\n\n   The principal argument advanced to show a Confronta-\ntion Clause violation concerns the phrase that Lambatos\nused when she referred to the DNA profile that the ISP\nlab received from Cellmark. This argument is developed\nmost fully in the dissenting opinion, and therefore we refer\nto the dissent\u2019s discussion of this issue.\n   In the view of the dissent, the following is the critical\nportion of Lambatos\u2019 testimony, with the particular words\nthat the dissent finds objectionable italicized:\n\n       \u201cQ Was there a computer match generated\n       of the male DNA profile found in semen\n       from the vaginal swabs of [L.J.] to a male\n       DNA profile that had been identified as hav-\n       ing originated from Sandy Williams?\n\n       \u201cA Yes, there was.\u201d Post, at 7 (opinion of\n       KAGAN, J.) (quoting App. 56; emphasis\n       added).\n\n  According to the dissent, the italicized phrase violated\npetitioner\u2019s confrontation right because Lambatos lacked\npersonal knowledge that the profile produced by Cellmark\nwas based on the vaginal swabs taken from the victim,\nL. J. As the dissent acknowledges, there would have been\n\u201cnothing wrong with Lambatos\u2019s testifying that two DNA\nprofiles\u2014the one shown in the Cellmark report and the\none derived from Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched each other;\nthat was a straightforward application of Lambatos\u2019s\nexpertise.\u201d Post, at 12. Thus, if Lambatos\u2019 testimony had\nbeen slightly modified as follows, the dissent would see no\nproblem:\n\n       \u201cQ Was there a computer match generated\n       of the male DNA profile produced by\n18                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n          Cellmark found in semen from the vaginal\n          swabs of [L.J.] to a male DNA profile that\n          had been identified as having originated\n          from Sandy Williams?\n\n          \u201cA Yes, there was.\u201d3\n\n   The defect in this argument is that under Illinois law\n(like federal law) it is clear that the putatively offending\nphrase in Lambatos\u2019 testimony was not admissible for the\npurpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted\u2014i.e.,\nthat the matching DNA profile was \u201cfound in semen from\nthe vaginal swabs.\u201d Rather, that fact was a mere premise\nof the prosecutor\u2019s question, and Lambatos simply as-\nsumed that premise to be true when she gave her answer\nindicating that there was a match between the two DNA\nprofiles. There is no reason to think that the trier of fact\ntook Lambatos\u2019 answer as substantive evidence to estab-\nlish where the DNA profiles came from.\n   The dissent\u2019s argument would have force if petitioner\nhad elected to have a jury trial. In that event, there would\nhave been a danger of the jury\u2019s taking Lambatos\u2019 testi-\nmony as proof that the Cellmark profile was derived from\nthe sample obtained from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs.\nAbsent an evaluation of the risk of juror confusion and\ncareful jury instructions, the testimony could not have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The  small difference between what Lambatos actually said on the\nstand and the slightly revised version that the dissent would find un-\nobjectionable shows that, despite the dissent\u2019s rhetoric, its narrow\nargument would have little practical effect in future cases. Prosecutors\nwould be allowed to do exactly what the prosecution did in this case so\nlong as their testifying experts\u2019 testimony was slightly modified along\nthe lines shown above. Following that course presumably would not\nconstitute a \u201cprosecutorial dodge,\u201d \u201csubterfuge,\u201d \u201cindirection,\u201d the \u201cneat\ntrick\u201d of \u201csneak[ing]\u201d in evidence, or the countenancing of constitutional\nviolations with \u201ca wink and a nod.\u201d See post, at 3, 16, 17, 12 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.).\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Were it not for that wording, the\nargument goes, the judge might have found that the pros-\necution failed to introduce sufficient admissible evidence\nto show that the Cellmark profile was derived from the\nsample taken from the victim, and the judge might have\ndisregarded the DNA evidence. This argument reflects a\nprofound lack of respect for the acumen of the trial judge.5\n   To begin, the dissent\u2019s argument finds no support in the\ntrial record. After defense counsel objected to Lambatos\u2019\ntestimony, the prosecutor made clear that she was asking\nLambatos only about \u201cher own testing based on [DNA]\ninformation\u201d that she had received from Cellmark. App.\n56. Recognizing that Lambatos\u2019 testimony would carry\nweight only if the underlying premises could be estab-\nlished, the judge noted that \u201cthe issue is . . . what weight\ndo you give the test [performed by Lambatos], not do you\nexclude it.\u201d Id., at 94. This echoes the old statement in\nBeckwith that an expert\u2019s opinion based on disputed prem-\nises \u201cmight not go for much; but still it [is] admissible\nevidence.\u201d 1 Camp., at 117, 170 Eng.

Cf. post, at 14\u201315 (opinion\nof KAGAN, J.). Instead, our point is that the identity of the factfinder\nmakes a big difference in evaluating the likelihood that the factfinder\nmistakenly based its decision on inadmissible evidence.\n  5 See post, at 14 (opinion of KAGAN, J.) (\u201cI do not doubt that a judge\n\ntypically will do better than a jury in excluding such inadmissible\nevidence from his decisionmaking process. Perhaps the judge did so\nhere\u201d (emphasis added)).\n20                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme\nCourt viewed the record in this way, and we see no ground\nfor disagreement.6\n   Second, it is extraordinarily unlikely that any trial\njudge would be confused in the way that the dissent posits.\nThat Lambatos was not competent to testify to the chain\nof custody of the sample taken from the victim was a point\nthat any trial judge or attorney would immediately under-\nstand. Lambatos, after all, had absolutely nothing to do\nwith the collection of the sample from the victim, its sub-\nsequent handling or preservation by the police in Illinois,\nor its shipment to and receipt by Cellmark. No trial judge\nwould take Lambatos\u2019 testimony as furnishing \u201cthe miss-\ning link\u201d in the State\u2019s evidence regarding the identity of\nthe sample that Cellmark tested. See post, at 6 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.).\n   Third, the admissible evidence left little room for argu-\nment that the sample tested by Cellmark came from any\nsource other than the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs.7 This is so\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The dissent finds evidence of the trial judge\u2019s confusion in his\n\nstatement that petitioner is \u201c \u2018the guy whose DNA, according to the\nevidence from the experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s\nvagina.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 14 (emphasis added). The dissent interprets the\nphrase \u201caccording to the evidence from the experts\u201d as a reference to\nwhat one expert, Lambatos, said about the origin of the sample that\nCellmark tested. In context, however, the judge\u2019s statement is best\nunderstood as attributing to Lambatos nothing more than the conclu-\nsion that there was a match between the two DNA profiles that were\ncompared. The foundational facts, that one of the profiles came from\nthe defendant and that the other came from \u201c \u2018the semen recovered from\nthe victim\u2019s vagina,\u2019 \u201d were established not by expert testimony but by\nordinary chain-of-custody evidence.\n   7 Our point is not that admissible evidence regarding the identity of\n\nthe sample that Cellmark tested excuses the admission of testimonial\nhearsay on this matter. Compare post, at 5\u20136 (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment), with post, at 14 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). Rather, our point\nis that, because there was substantial (albeit circumstantial) evidence\non this matter, there is no reason to infer that the trier of fact must\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

If any other items that\nmight have contained Williams\u2019 DNA had been sent\nto Cellmark or were otherwise in Cellmark\u2019s possession,\nthere would have been a chance of a mix-up or of cross-\ncontamination. See District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third\nJudicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. 52, 80 (2009) (ALITO,\nJ., concurring). But there is absolutely nothing to suggest\nthat Cellmark had any such items. Thus, the fact that the\nCellmark profile matched Williams\u2014the very man whom\nthe victim identified in a lineup and at trial as her at-\ntacker\u2014was itself striking confirmation that the sample\nthat Cellmark tested was the sample taken from the victim\u2019s\nvaginal swabs. For these reasons, it is fanciful to suggest\nthat the trial judge took Lambatos\u2019 testimony as providing\ncritical chain-of-custody evidence.\n                                  C\n  Other than the phrase that Lambatos used in referring\nto the Cellmark profile, no specific passage in the trial\nrecord has been identified as violating the Confrontation\nClause, but it is nevertheless suggested that the State\nsomehow introduced \u201cthe substance of Cellmark\u2019s report\ninto evidence.\u201d Post, at 8 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). The\nmain impetus for this argument appears to be the (errone-\nous) view that unless the substance of the report was\nsneaked in, there would be insufficient evidence in the\nrecord on two critical points: first, that the Cellmark\nprofile was based on the semen in the victim\u2019s vaginal\nswabs and, second, that Cellmark\u2019s procedures were reli-\nable.

ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   As to legal relevance, the question before us is whether\npetitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was\nviolated, not whether the State offered sufficient founda-\ntional evidence to support the admission of Lambatos\u2019\nopinion about the DNA match. In order to prove these\nunderlying facts, the prosecution relied on circumstantial\nevidence, and the Illinois courts found that this evidence\nwas sufficient to satisfy state-law requirements regarding\nproof of foundational facts. See 385 Ill. App. 3d, at 366\u2013\n368, 895 N. E. 2d, at 967\u2013968; 238 Ill. 2d, at 138, 939 N. E.\n2d, at 275. We cannot review that interpretation and\napplication of Illinois law. Thus, even if the record did not\ncontain any evidence that could rationally support a find-\ning that Cellmark produced a scientifically reliable DNA\nprofile based on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab, that would not estab-\nlish a Confrontation Clause violation. If there were no\nproof that Cellmark produced an accurate profile based on\nthat sample, Lambatos\u2019 testimony regarding the match\nwould be irrelevant, but the Confrontation Clause, as\ninterpreted in Crawford, does not bar the admission of\nirrelevant evidence, only testimonial statements by de-\nclarants who are not subject to cross-examination.8\n   It is not correct, however, that the trial record lacks\nadmissible evidence with respect to the source of the sam-\nple that Cellmark tested or the reliability of the Cell-\nmark profile. As to the source of the sample, the State\noffered conventional chain-of-custody evidence, namely,\nthe testimony of the physician who obtained the vaginal\nswabs, the testimony of the police employees who handled\nand kept custody of that evidence until it was sent to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Applying the Due Process Clause, we have held that a federal court\n\nmay determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the\nexistence of all the elements needed for conviction for a state offense.\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 314 (1979), but petitioner has not\nraised a due process claim. And in any event, L. J.\u2019s identification of\npetitioner as her assailant would be sufficient to defeat any such claim.\n                       Cite as: 567 U.

In addition, as already discussed,\nthe match between the Cellmark profile and petitioner\u2019s\nprofile was itself telling confirmation that the Cellmark\nprofile was deduced from the semen on the vaginal swabs.\n   This match also provided strong circumstantial evidence\nregarding the reliability of Cellmark\u2019s work. Assuming (for\nthe reasons discussed above) that the Cellmark profile\nwas based on the semen on the vaginal swabs, how could\nshoddy or dishonest work in the Cellmark lab9 have re-\nsulted in the production of a DNA profile that just so\nhappened to match petitioner\u2019s? If the semen found on the\nvaginal swabs was not petitioner\u2019s and thus had an en-\ntirely different DNA profile, how could sloppy work in the\nCellmark lab have transformed that entirely different\nprofile into one that matched petitioner\u2019s? And without\naccess to any other sample of petitioner\u2019s DNA (and recall\nthat petitioner was not even under suspicion at this time),\nhow could a dishonest lab technician have substituted pe-\ntitioner\u2019s DNA profile? Under the circumstances of this\ncase, it was surely permissible for the trier of fact to infer\nthat the odds of any of this were exceedingly low.\n   This analysis reveals that much of the dissent\u2019s argu-\nment rests on a very clear error. The dissent argues that\nLambatos\u2019 testimony could be \u201ctrue\u201d only if the predicate\nfacts asserted in the Cellmark report were true, and there-\nfore Lambatos\u2019 reference to the report must have been\nused for the purpose of proving the truth of those facts.\nSee post, at 10\u201311. But the truth of Lambatos\u2019 testimony,\nproperly understood, was not dependent on the truth of\nany predicate facts. Lambatos testified that two DNA\nprofiles matched.

Of course, Lamba-\ntos\u2019 opinion would have lacked probative value if the pros-\necution had not introduced other evidence to establish the\nprovenance of the profiles, but that has nothing to do with\nthe truth of her testimony.\n   The dissent is similarly mistaken in its contention that\nthe Cellmark report \u201cwas offered for its truth because that\nis all such \u2018basis evidence\u2019 can be offered for.\u201d Post, at 13;\nsee also post, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(\u201c[S]tatements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s\nopinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay\npurpose\u201d).

The Rule\n703 approach, which was controversial when adopted,10 is\nbased on the idea that the disclosure of basis evidence can\nhelp the factfinder understand the expert\u2019s thought pro-\ncess and determine what weight to give to the expert\u2019s\nopinion. For example, if the factfinder were to suspect\nthat the expert relied on factual premises with no support\nin the record, or that the expert drew an unwarranted\ninference from the premises on which the expert relied,\nthen the probativeness or credibility of the expert\u2019s opin-\nion would be seriously undermined.

The dissent concedes\nthat \u201cthe trial judge might have ignored Lambatos\u2019s\nstatement about the Cellmark report,\u201d but nonetheless\nmaintains that \u201cthe admission of that statement violated\nthe Confrontation Clause even if the judge ultimately put\nit aside.\u201d Post, at 15, n. 2. But in a bench trial, it is not\nnecessary for the judge to stop and make a formal state-\nment on the record regarding the limited reason for which\nthe testimony is admitted. If the judge does not consider\nthe testimony for its truth, the effect is precisely the same.\nThus, if the trial judge in this case did not rely on the\nstatement in question for its truth, there is simply no way\naround the proviso in Crawford that the Confrontation\nClause applies only to out-of-court statements that are\n\u201cuse[d]\u201d to \u201cestablis[h] the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d\n541 U.

In those cases, the forensic reports\nwere introduced into evidence, and there is no question that\nthis was done for the purpose of proving the truth of what\nthey asserted: in Bullcoming that the defendant\u2019s blood\nalcohol level exceeded the legal limit and in Melendez-\nDiaz that the substance in question contained cocaine.\nNothing comparable happened here.

An\nexpert witness referred to the report not to prove the truth\nof the matter asserted in the report, i.e., that the report\ncontained an accurate profile of the perpetrator\u2019s DNA,\nbut only to establish that the report contained a DNA\nprofile that matched the DNA profile deduced from peti-\ntioner\u2019s blood. Thus, just as in Street, the report was not to\nbe considered for its truth but only for the \u201cdistinctive and\nlimited purpose\u201d of seeing whether it matched something\nelse. 471 U. S., at 417. The relevance of the match was\nthen established by independent circumstantial evidence\nshowing that the Cellmark report was based on a forensic\nsample taken from the scene of the crime.\n   Our conclusion will not open the door for the kind of\nabuses suggested by some of petitioner\u2019s amici and the\ndissent. See post, at 10\u201311; Brief for Richard D. Friedman\nas Amicus Curiae 20\u201321. In the hypothetical situations\nposited, an expert expresses an opinion based on factual\npremises not supported by any admissible evidence, and\nmay also reveal the out-of-court statements on which the\nexpert relied.11 There are at least four safeguards to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 Both JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE KAGAN quote statements in D.\n\nKaye, D. Bernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence\n\u00a74.10.1, pp. 196\u2013197 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter New Wigmore), that are\ncritical of the theory that an expert, without violating the Confronta-\ntion Clause, may express an opinion that is based on testimonial\nhearsay and may, in some circumstances, disclose that testimonial\nhearsay to the trier of fact. The principal basis for this criticism seems\nto be the fear that juries, even if given limiting instructions, will view\nthe disclosed hearsay as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted.\nSee id., at 196, n. 36 (referring reader to the more detailed discussion in\nMnookin, Expert Evidence and the Confrontation Clause After Craw-\nford v.

In the 2012 Supplement of The\nNew Wigmore, the authors discuss the present case and criticize the\nreasoning of the Illinois courts as follows:\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

First, trial courts can screen out\nexperts who would act as mere conduits for hearsay by\nstrictly enforcing the requirement that experts display\nsome genuine \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized\nknowledge [that] will help the trier of fact to understand\nthe evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed. Rule\nEvid. 702(a). Second, experts are generally precluded\nfrom disclosing inadmissible evidence to a jury. See Fed.\nRule Evid. 703; People v. Pasch, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ill/brKb/people-v-pasch/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175\u2013176,\n604 N. E. 2d 294, 310\u2013311 (1992). Third, if such evidence\nis disclosed, the trial judges may and, under most circum-\nstances, must, instruct the jury that out-of-court state-\nments cannot be accepted for their truth, and that an\nexpert\u2019s opinion is only as good as the independent evi-\ndence that establishes its underlying premises. See Fed.\nRules Evid. 105, 703; People v.

E. 2d 217, 236\u2013237 (1992). And fourth, if the\nprosecution cannot muster any independent admissible\nevidence to prove the foundational facts that are essential\nto the relevance of the expert\u2019s testimony, then the ex-\npert\u2019s testimony cannot be given any weight by the trier of\nfact.12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  \u201cThe problem with [the not-for-the-truth-of-the-matter argument\n  accepted by the Illinois courts] is that Lambatos had to rely on the\n  truth of the statements in the Cellmark report to reach her own con-\n  clusion. The claim that evidence that the jury must credit in order to\n  credit the conclusion of the expert is introduced for something other\n  than its truth is sheer fiction.\u201d New Wigmore \u00a74.11.6, at 24 (2012\n  Supp.) (emphasis added).\n  This discussion is flawed. It overlooks the fact that there was no jury\nin this case, and as we have explained, the trier of fact did not have to\nrely on any testimonial hearsay in order to find that Lambatos\u2019 testi-\nmony about the DNA match was supported by adequate foundational\nevidence and was thus probative.\n  12 Our discussion of the first ground for our decision cannot conclude\n\nwithout commenting on the Kocak case, which dramatically appears at\nthe beginning of the dissent. In that case, a Cellmark lab analyst\n28                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                             IV \n\n                              A\n\n   Even if the Cellmark report had been introduced for its\ntruth, we would nevertheless conclude that there was no\nConfrontation Clause violation. The Confrontation Clause\nrefers to testimony by \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused.\nBoth the noted evidence scholar James Henry Wigmore\nand Justice Harlan interpreted the Clause in a strictly\nliteral sense as referring solely to persons who testify in\ncourt, but we have not adopted this narrow view. It has\nbeen said that \u201c[t]he difficulty with the Wigmore-Harlan\nview in its purest form is its tension with much of the\napparent history surrounding the evolution of the right of\nconfrontation at common law.\u201d White v. Illinois, 502 U. S.\n346, 360 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring). \u201c[T]he principal\nevil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed,\u201d the\nCourt concluded in Crawford, \u201cwas the civil-law mode of\ncriminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte\nexaminations as evidence against the accused.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 50. \u201c[I]n England, pretrial examinations of suspects\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nrealized while testifying at a pretrial hearing that there was an error in\nthe lab\u2019s report and that the DNA profile attributed to the accused was\nactually that of the victim. The lesson of this cautionary tale is nothing\nmore than the truism that it is possible for an apparently incriminating\nDNA profile to be mistakenly attributed to an accused. But requiring\nthat the lab analyst or analysts who produced the DNA profile be called\nas prosecution witnesses is neither sufficient nor necessary to prevent\nsuch errors. Since samples may be mixed up or contaminated at many\npoints along the way from a crime scene to the lab, calling one or more\nlab analysts will not necessarily catch all such mistakes. For example,\na mistake might be made by a clerical employee responsible for receiv-\ning shipments of samples and then providing them to the lab\u2019s techni-\ncians. What is needed is for the trier of fact to make sure that the\nevidence, whether direct or circumstantial, rules out the possibility of\nsuch mistakes at every step along the way. And in the usual course of\nauthentication, defense counsel will have access to sufficient infor-\nmation to inquire into, question, or challenge the procedures used by a\nlaboratory if this seems to be a prudent and productive strategy.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Crawford, supra, at 43). The\nCourt has thus interpreted the Confrontation Clause as\nprohibiting modern-day practices that are tantamount to\nthe abuses that gave rise to the recognition of the confron-\ntation right. But any further expansion would strain the\nconstitutional text.\n   The abuses that the Court has identified as prompting\nthe adoption of the Confrontation Clause shared the fol-\nlowing two characteristics: (a) they involved out-of-court\nstatements having the primary purpose of accusing a\ntargeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct and\n(b) they involved formalized statements such as affidavits,\ndepositions, prior testimony, or confessions. In all but\none of the post-Crawford cases13 in which a Confrontation\nClause violation has been found, both of these characteris-\ntics were present. See Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at 308 (slip\nop., at 3\u20134) (certified lab report having purpose of showing\nthat defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level exceeded legal limit);\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 308 (certified lab report\nhaving purpose of showing that substance connected to\ndefendant contained cocaine); Crawford, supra, at 38\n(custodial statement made after Miranda warnings that\nshifted blame from declarant to accused).14 The one excep-\ntion occurred in Hammon v. Indiana, 547 U. S. 813, 829\u2013\n832 (2006), which was decided together with Davis v.\nWashington, but in Hammon and every other post-\nCrawford case in which the Court has found a violation of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Experience might yet show that the holdings in those cases should\n\nbe reconsidered for the reasons, among others, expressed in the dis-\nsents the decisions produced. Those decisions are not challenged in this\ncase and are to be deemed binding precedents, but they can and should\nbe distinguished on the facts here.\n  14 With respect to Crawford, see Davis, 547 U. S., at 840 (THOMAS, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n30                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthe confrontation right, the statement at issue had the\nprimary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\n                               B\n   In Hammon, the one case in which an informal state-\nment was held to violate the Confrontation Clause, we\nconsidered statements elicited in the course of police in-\nterrogation. We held that a statement does not fall\nwithin the ambit of the Clause when it is made \u201cunder\ncircumstances objectively indicating that the primary\npurpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance\nto meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d 547 U. S., at 822. In\nBryant, another police-interrogation case, we explained\nthat a person who makes a statement to resolve an ongo-\ning emergency is not acting like a trial witness because\nthe declarant\u2019s purpose is not to provide a solemn declara-\ntion for use at trial, but to bring an end to an ongoing\nthreat. See 562 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 11, 14). We\nnoted that \u201cthe prospect of fabrication . . . is presumably\nsignificantly diminished\u201d when a statement is made under\nsuch circumstances, id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) and that\nreliability is a salient characteristic of a statement that\nfalls outside the reach of the Confrontation Clause, id., at\n___\u2013___ (slip op., at 14\u201315). We emphasized that if a\nstatement is not made for \u201cthe primary purpose of creating\nan out-of-court substitute for trial testimony,\u201d its admissi-\nbility \u201cis the concern of state and federal rules of evidence,\nnot the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n11\u201312).\n   In Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, the Court held that\nthe particular forensic reports at issue qualified as testi-\nmonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all\nforensic reports fall into the same category.

There was nothing resembling\nan ongoing emergency, as the suspects in both cases had\nalready been captured, and the tests in question were\nrelatively simple and can generally be performed by a\nsingle analyst. In addition, the technicians who prepared\nthe reports must have realized that their contents (which\nreported an elevated blood-alcohol level and the presence\nof an illegal drug) would be incriminating.\n                             C\n   The Cellmark report is very different. It plainly was not\nprepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted\nindividual. In identifying the primary purpose of an out-\nof-court statement, we apply an objective test. Bryant, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We look for the primary\npurpose that a reasonable person would have ascribed to\nthe statement, taking into account all of the surrounding\ncircumstances. Ibid.\n   Here, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report,\nviewed objectively, was not to accuse petitioner or to cre-\nate evidence for use at trial. When the ISP lab sent the\nsample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a\ndangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain\nevidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in\ncustody nor under suspicion at that time. Similarly, no\none at Cellmark could have possibly known that the\nprofile that it produced would turn out to inculpate\npetitioner\u2014or for that matter, anyone else whose DNA\nprofile was in a law enforcement database. Under these\ncircumstances, there was no \u201cprospect of fabrication\u201d and\nno incentive to produce anything other than a scientifi-\ncally sound and reliable profile. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n   The situation in which the Cellmark technicians found\nthemselves was by no means unique. When lab techni-\ncians are asked to work on the production of a DNA pro-\nfile, they often have no idea what the consequences of\n32                 WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\ntheir work will be. In some cases, a DNA profile may\nprovide powerful incriminating evidence against a person\nwho is identified either before or after the profile is com-\npleted. But in others, the primary effect of the profile is\nto exonerate a suspect who has been charged or is under\ninvestigation. The technicians who prepare a DNA profile\ngenerally have no way of knowing whether it will turn out\nto be incriminating or exonerating\u2014or both.\n  It is also significant that in many labs, numerous tech-\nnicians work on each DNA profile. See Brief for New York\nCounty District Attorney\u2019s Office et al. as Amici Curiae 6\n(New York lab uses at least 12 technicians for each case);\nPeople v.

When the\nwork of a lab is divided up in such a way, it is likely that\nthe sole purpose of each technician is simply to perform\nhis or her task in accordance with accepted procedures.\n  Finally, the knowledge that defects in a DNA profile\nmay often be detected from the profile itself provides a\nfurther safeguard. In this case, for example, Lambatos\ntestified that she would have been able to tell from the\nprofile if the sample used by Cellmark had been degraded\nprior to testing. As noted above, moreover, there is no real\nchance that \u201csample contamination, sample switching,\nmislabeling, [or] fraud\u201d could have led Cellmark to pro-\nduce a DNA profile that falsely matched petitioner. Post,\nat 21 (KAGAN, J., dissenting). At the time of the testing,\npetitioner had not yet been identified as a suspect, and\nthere is no suggestion that anyone at Cellmark had a\nsample of his DNA to swap in by malice or mistake. And\ngiven the complexity of the DNA molecule, it is inconceiv-\nable that shoddy lab work would somehow produce a DNA\nprofile that just so happened to have the precise genetic\nmakeup of petitioner, who just so happened to be picked\nout of a lineup by the victim.

S. 36 (2004)? Because I believe the\nquestion difficult, important, and not squarely addressed\neither today or in our earlier opinions, and because I\nbelieve additional briefing would help us find a proper,\ngenerally applicable answer, I would set this case for\nreargument. In the absence of doing so, I adhere to the\ndissenting views set forth in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu-\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305 (2009), and Bullcoming v. New Mexico,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011). I also join the plurality\u2019s opinion.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case is another in our series involving the inter-\nsection of the Confrontation Clause and expert testimony.\nBefore trial, the prosecution\u2019s expert, Sandra Lambatos,\nreceived a copy of a report prepared by Cellmark Diagnos-\ntics Laboratory. That report reflected the fact that\nCellmark technicians had received material from a vaginal\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nswab taken from the crime victim, had identified semen in\nthat material, and had derived a profile of the male DNA\nthat the semen contained. Lambatos then entered that\nprofile into an Illinois State Police Crime Laboratory\ncomputerized database, which contained, among many\nother DNA profiles, a profile derived by the crime labora-\ntory from Williams\u2019 blood (taken at an earlier time). The\ncomputer she was using showed that the two profiles\nmatched. Lambatos then confirmed the match.\n   Later, Lambatos testified at trial, where the prosecutor\nasked her three relevant questions. First, the prosecutor\nasked whether there was \u201ca computer match generated of\nthe male DNA profile [derived by Cellmark] found in [the]\nsemen from the vaginal swabs . . . to [the] male DNA\nprofile [found in the database] that had been identified as\nhaving originated from Sandy Williams\u201d? App. 56. Since\nthe computer had shown such a match, Lambatos an-\nswered affirmatively. Ibid.\n   Second, the prosecutor asked whether Lambatos had in-\ndependently \u201ccompare[d the DNA profile that Cellmark\nhad derived from] the semen that had been identified . . .\nfrom the vaginal swabs of [the victim] to the male DNA\nprofile [found in the database] that had been [derived] . . .\nfrom the blood of Sandy Williams.\u201d Ibid. Lambatos again\nanswered affirmatively. Ibid.\n   Third, the prosecutor asked whether, in Lambatos\u2019 ex-\npert opinion, the DNA profile derived from the semen\nidentified in the vaginal swabs of the victim was \u201ca match\nto Sandy Williams.\u201d Id., at 58. Lambatos again answered\naffirmatively. Ibid.\n   The Confrontation Clause problem lies in the fact that\nLambatos did not have personal knowledge that the male\nDNA profile that Cellmark said was derived from the\ncrime victim\u2019s vaginal swab sample was in fact correctly\nderived from that sample. And no Cellmark expert testi-\nfied that it was true. Rather, she simply relied for her\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\nknowledge of the fact upon Cellmark\u2019s report. And the\ndefendant Williams had no opportunity to cross-examine\nthe individual or individuals who produced that report.\n   In its first conclusion, the plurality explains why it finds\nthat admission of Lambatos\u2019 testimony nonetheless did not\nviolate the Confrontation Clause. That Clause concerns\nout-of-court statements admitted for their truth. Ante,\nat 15\u201316. Lambatos\u2019 testimony did not introduce the\nCellmark report (which other circumstantial evidence\nsupported) for its truth. Ante, at 16\u201321. Rather, Lam-\nbatos used the Cellmark report only to indicate the under-\nlying factual information upon which she based her\nindependent expert opinion. Ibid. Under well-established\nprinciples of evidence, experts may rely on otherwise\ninadmissible out-of-court statements as a basis for forming\nan expert opinion if they are of a kind that experts in the\nfield normally rely upon. See Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Ill.\nRule Evid. 703. Nor need the prosecution enter those out-\nof-court statements into evidence for their truth. That,\nthe Illinois courts held, is just what took place here. Ante,\nat 9\u201310.\n   The dissent would abandon this well-established rule.\nIt would not permit Lambatos to offer an expert opinion\nin reliance on the Cellmark report unless the prosecution\nalso produces one or more experts who wrote or otherwise\nproduced the report. I am willing to accept the dissent\u2019s\ncharacterization of the present rule as artificial, see post,\nat 15\u201317 (opinion of KAGAN, J.), but I am not certain that\nthe dissent has produced a workable alternative, see\nBullcoming, supra, at ___ (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 7) (expressing similar view).\n   Once one abandons the traditional rule, there would\nseem often to be no logical stopping place between requir-\ning the prosecution to call as a witness one of the labora-\ntory experts who worked on the matter and requiring the\nprosecution to call all of the laboratory experts who did so.\n4                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nExperts\u2014especially laboratory experts\u2014regularly rely on\nthe technical statements and results of other experts to\nform their own opinions. The reality of the matter is that\nthe introduction of a laboratory report involves layer upon\nlayer of technical statements (express or implied) made by\none expert and relied upon by another. Hence my general\nquestion: How does the Confrontation Clause apply to\ncrime laboratory reports and underlying technical state-\nments made by laboratory technicians?\n                             B\n   The general question is not easy to answer. The Cali-\nfornia case described at the outset of the dissenting opin-\nion helps to illustrate the difficulty. In that example,\nCellmark, the very laboratory involved in this case, tested\na DNA sample taken from the crime scene. A laboratory\nanalyst, relying upon a report the laboratory had prepared,\ninitially stated (at a pretrial hearing about admissibil-\nity) that the laboratory had found that the crime-scene\nDNA sample matched a sample of the defendant\u2019s DNA.\nBut during the hearing and after reviewing the labor-\natory\u2019s notes, the laboratory analyst realized that the\nwritten report was mistaken. In fact, the testing showed\nonly that the crime-scene DNA matched a sample of the\nvictim\u2019s DNA, not the defendant\u2019s DNA. At some point\nduring the writing of the report, someone, perhaps the\ntestifying analyst herself, must have misread the proper\noriginal sample labeling. Upon discovering the error, the\nanalyst corrected her testimony.\n   The example is useful, not simply because as adapted\nit might show the importance of cross-examination (an\nimportance no one doubts), but also because it can reveal\nthe nature of the more general question before us. When\nthe laboratory in the example received the DNA samples,\nit labeled them properly. The laboratory\u2019s final report\nmixed up the labels. Any one of many different techni-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncians could be responsible for an error like that. And the\ntestifying analyst might not have reviewed the underlying\nnotes and caught the error during direct examination (or\nfor that matter, during cross-examination).\n   Adapting the example slightly, assume that the admis-\nsibility of the initial laboratory report into trial had been\ndirectly at issue. Who should the prosecution have had to\ncall to testify? Only the analyst who signed the report\nnoting the match? What if the analyst who made the\nmatch knew nothing about either the laboratory\u2019s underly-\ning procedures or the specific tests run in the particular\ncase? Should the prosecution then have had to call all\npotentially involved laboratory technicians to testify? Six\nto twelve or more technicians could have been involved.\n(See Appendix, infra, which lists typically relevant labora-\ntory procedures.) Some or all of the words spoken or\nwritten by each technician out of court might well have\nconstituted relevant statements offered for their truth and\nreasonably relied on by a supervisor or analyst writing\nthe laboratory report. Indeed, petitioner\u2019s amici argue\nthat the technicians at each stage of the process should\nbe subject to cross-examination. See Brief for Innocence\nNetwork as Amicus Curiae 13\u201323 (hereinafter Innocence\nNetwork Brief).\n   And as is true of many hearsay statements that fall\nwithin any of the 20 or more hearsay exceptions, cross-\nexamination could sometimes significantly help to elicit\nthe truth. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803 (listing 24 hearsay\nexceptions). The Confrontation Clause as interpreted in\nCrawford recognizes, as a limitation upon a pure \u201ctesti-\nmonial statement\u201d requirement, circumstances where the\ndefendant had an adequate \u201cprior opportunity to cross-\nexamine.\u201d 541 U. S., at 59. To what extent might the\n\u201ctestimonial statements\u201d requirement embody one or more\n(or modified versions) of these traditional hearsay excep-\ntions as well?\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\n   Lower courts and treatise writers have recognized the\nproblem. And they have come up with a variety of solu-\ntions. The New Wigmore, for example, lists several non-\nexclusive approaches to when testifying experts may rely\non testing results or reports by nontestifying experts (i.e.,\nDNA technicians or analysts), including: (1) \u201cthe dominant\napproach,\u201d which is simply to determine the need to testify\nby looking \u201cthe quality of the nontestifying expert\u2019s report,\nthe testifying expert\u2019s involvement in the process, and the\nconsequent ability of the testifying expert to use inde-\npendent judgment and interpretive skill\u201d; (2) permitting \u201ca\nsubstitute expert to testify about forensic science results\nonly when the first expert is unavailable\u201d (irrespective of\nthe lack of opportunity to cross-examine the first expert,\ncf. Crawford, supra, at 59); (3) permitting \u201ca substitute\nexpert\u201d to testify if \u201cthe original test was documented in a\nthorough way that permits the substitute expert to evalu-\nate, assess, and interpret it\u201d; (4) permitting a DNA analyst\nto introduce DNA test results at trial without having\n\u201cpersonally perform[ed] every specific aspect of each DNA\ntest in question, provided the analyst was present during\nthe critical stages of the test, is familiar with the process\nand the laboratory protocol involved, reviews the results\nin proximity to the test, and either initials or signs the\nfinal report outlining the results\u201d; (5) permitting the in-\ntroduction of a crime laboratory DNA report without the\ntestimony of a technician where the \u201ctesting in its pre-\nliminary stages\u201d only \u201crequires the technician simply to\nperform largely mechanical or ministerial tasks . . . absent\nsome reason to believe there was error or falsification\u201d;\nand (6) permitting introduction of the report without\nrequiring the technicians to testify where there is a show-\ning of \u201cgenuine unavailability.\u201d See D. Kaye, D. Bern-\nstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence,\n\u00a7\u00a74.10.2, 4.10.3, pp. 202, 204, 206 (2d ed. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks and footnote omitted); id., \u00a74.11.6, at 24\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\n(Supp. 2012).\n   Some of these approaches seem more readily compatible\nwith Crawford than others. Some seem more easily con-\nsidered by a rules committee (or by state courts) than by\nthis Court. Nonetheless, all assume some kind of Craw-\nford boundary\u2014some kind of limitation upon the scope of\nits application\u2014though they reflect different views as to\njust how and when that might be done.\n   Answering the underlying general question just dis-\ncussed, and doing so soon, is important. Trial judges in\nboth federal and state courts apply and interpret hearsay\nrules as part of their daily trial work. The trial of criminal\ncases makes up a large portion of that work. And labora-\ntory reports frequently constitute a portion of the evidence\nin ordinary criminal trials. Obviously, judges, prosecu-\ntors, and defense lawyers have to know, in as definitive a\nform as possible, what the Constitution requires so that\nthey can try their cases accordingly.\n   The several different opinions filed today embody sev-\neral serious, but different, approaches to the difficult gen-\neral question. Yet none fully deals with the underlying\nquestion as to how, after Crawford, Confrontation Clause\n\u201ctestimonial statement\u201d requirements apply to crime lab-\noratory reports. Nor can I find a general answer in\nMelendez-Diaz or Bullcoming. While, as a matter of pure\nlogic, one might use those cases to answer a narrowed\nversion of the question presented here, see post, at 7\u20138\n(KAGAN, J., dissenting), those cases do not fully con-\nsider the broader evidentiary problem presented. I conse-\nquently find the dissent\u2019s response, \u201cBeen there, done\nthat,\u201d unsatisfactory. See post, at 21.\n   Under these circumstances, I would have this case re-\nargued. I would request the parties and amici to focus\nspecifically upon the broader \u201climits\u201d question. And I\nwould permit them to discuss, not only the possible impli-\ncations of our earlier post-Crawford opinions, but also any\n8                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nnecessary modifications of statements made in the opin-\nions of those earlier cases.\n                              II\n   In the absence of reargument, I adhere to the dissenting\nview set forth in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, under\nwhich the Cellmark report would not be considered \u201ctes-\ntimonial\u201d and barred by the Confrontation Clause. See\nalso ante, at 28\u201333 (setting forth similar conclusion). That\nview understands the Confrontation Clause as interpreted\nin Crawford to bar the admission of \u201c[t]estimonial\u201d state-\nments made out of court unless the declarant is unavail-\nable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-\nexamine. 541 U. S., at 59 (emphasis added). It also\nunderstands the word \u201ctestimonial\u201d as having outer limits\nand Crawford as describing a constitutional heartland.\nAnd that view would leave the States with constitutional\nleeway to maintain traditional expert testimony rules as\nwell as hearsay exceptions where there are strong reasons\nfor doing so and Crawford\u2019s basic rationale does not apply.\n   In particular, the States could create an exception that\npresumptively would allow introduction of DNA reports\nfrom accredited crime laboratories. The defendant would\nremain free to call laboratory technicians as witnesses.\nWere there significant reason to question a laboratory\u2019s\ntechnical competence or its neutrality, the presumptive\nexception would disappear, thereby requiring the prosecu-\ntion to produce any relevant technical witnesses. Such\nan exception would lie outside Crawford\u2019s constitutional\nlimits.\n   Consider the report before us. Cellmark\u2019s DNA report\nembodies technical or professional data, observations, and\njudgments; the employees who contributed to the report\u2019s\nfindings were professional analysts working on technical\nmatters at a certified laboratory; and the employees oper-\nated behind a veil of ignorance that likely prevented them\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nfrom knowing the identity of the defendant in this case.\nStatements of this kind fall within a hearsay exception\nthat has constituted an important part of the law of evi-\ndence for decades. See Fed. Rule Evid. 803(6) (\u201cRecords of\nRegularly Conducted Activity\u201d); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence\n\u00a7\u00a71517\u20131533, pp. 1878\u20131899 (1904) (\u201cRegular Entries\u201d).\nAnd for somewhat similar reasons, I believe that such\nstatements also presumptively fall outside the category of\n\u201ctestimonial\u201d statements that the Confrontation Clause\nmakes inadmissible.\n   As the plurality points out, ante, at 28\u201333, the introduc-\ntion of statements of this kind does not risk creating\nthe \u201cprincipal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was\ndirected.\u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 50. That evil consists of\nthe pre-Constitution practice of using \u201cex parte examina-\ntions as evidence against the accused.\u201d Ibid. Sir Walter\nRaleigh\u2019s case illustrates the point. State authorities\nquestioned Lord Cobham, the key witness against Raleigh,\noutside his presence. They then used those testimonial\nstatements in court against Raleigh. And when Raleigh\nasked to face and to challenge his accuser, he was denied\nthat opportunity. See id., at 44.\n   The Confrontation Clause prohibits the use of this kind\nof evidence because allowing it would deprive a defendant\nof the ability to cross-examine the witness. Id., at 61\u201362;\nMattox v. United States, 156 U. S. 237, 242\u2013243 (1895).\nThat deprivation would prevent a defendant from con-\nfronting the witness. And it would thereby prevent a\ndefendant from probing the witness\u2019 perception, memory,\nnarration, and sincerity. See, e.g., 2 K. Broun et al.,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7245, p. 125 (6th ed. 2006);\nE. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof Under the Anglo-\nAmerican System of Litigation 119\u2013127 (1956); 30 C.\nWright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a76324, pp. 44\u201349 (1997); see also M. Hale, History of the\nCommon Law of England 258 (1713) (explaining virtues of\n10                 WILLIAMS v.

But the need for\ncross-examination is considerably diminished when the\nout-of-court statement was made by an accredited labora-\ntory employee operating at a remove from the investiga-\ntion in the ordinary course of professional work.\n   For one thing, as the hearsay exception itself reflects,\nalternative features of such situations help to guarantee\nits accuracy. An accredited laboratory must satisfy well-\nestablished professional guidelines that seek to ensure the\nscientific reliability of the laboratory\u2019s results.

L. & Pol\u2019y 59, 72\u201376 (2007). For\nexample, forensic DNA testing laboratories permitted to\naccess the FBI\u2019s Combined DNA Index System must\nadhere to standards governing, among other things, the\norganization and management of the laboratory; educa-\ntion, training, and experience requirements for laboratory\npersonnel; the laboratory\u2019s physical facilities and security\nmeasures; control of physical evidence; validation of test-\ning methodologies; procedures for analyzing samples,\nincluding the reagents and controls that are used in the\ntesting process; equipment calibration and maintenance;\ndocumentation of the process used to test each sample\nhandled by the laboratory; technical and administrative\nreview of every case file; proficiency testing of laboratory;\npersonnel; corrective action that addresses any discrepan-\ncies in proficiency tests and casework analysis; internal\nand external audits of the laboratory; environmental\nhealth and safety; and outsourcing of testing to vendor\nlaboratories.

It is not difficult to find instances in\nwhich laboratory procedures have been abused. See, e.g.,\nInnocence Network Brief 6\u201311; App. to Brief for Public\nDefender Service for the District of Columbia et al. as\nAmici Curiae 1a\u201312a; cf. Giannelli, The Abuse of Scientific\nEvidence in Criminal Cases: The Need for Independent\nCrime Laboratories, 4 Va. J. Soc. Pol\u2019y & L. 439 (1997).\nMoreover, DNA testing itself has exonerated some defend-\nants who previously had been convicted in part upon the\nbasis of testimony by laboratory experts. See Melendez-\nDiaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U. S., at 319 (citing Garrett &\nNeufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrong-\nful Convictions, 95 Va. L. Rev. 1 (2009)).\n  But if accreditation did not prevent admission of faulty\nevidence in some of those cases, neither did cross-\nexamination. In the wrongful-conviction cases to which\nthis Court has previously referred, the forensic experts all\ntestified in court and were available for cross-examination.\nSklansky, Hearsay\u2019s Last Hurrah, 2009 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 72\u2013\n73 (cited study \u201cdid not identify any cases in which hear-\nsay from forensic analysts contributed to the conviction of\ninnocent defendants\u201d); see Garrett & Neufeld, supra, at\n10\u201312, 84, 89 (noting that cross-examination was rarely\neffective); see also Murphy, The New Forensics: Criminal\nJustice, False Certainty, and the Second Generation of\nScientific Evidence, 95 Cal. L. Rev. 721, 785\u2013786 (2007)\n(suggesting need for greater reliance upon accreditation\nand oversight of accredited laboratories); Sklansky, supra,\nat 74 (same). Similarly, the role of cross-examination is\nambiguous in the laboratory example that the dissent\ndescribes. See post, at 1\u20132. (Apparently, the report\u2019s error\ncame to light and was corrected after cross-examination\nhad concluded, see Thompson, Taroni, & Aitken, Author\u2019s\nResponse, 49 J. Forensic Sci. 1202 (2003), and in any\n12                 WILLIAMS v.

Cf.\nMichigan v. Bryant, 562 U.

As the plurality notes, in\nevery post-Crawford case in which the Court has found a\nConfrontation Clause violation, the statement at issue had\nthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\nAnte, at 29\u201331; see, e.g., Davis v. Washington, 547 U. S.\n813, 822 (2006) (\u201cprimary purpose . . . is to establish or\nprove past events potentially relevant to later criminal\nprosecution\u201d); Bryant, supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 11\u201312)\n(\u201cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute\nfor trial testimony\u201d). The declarant was essentially an\nadverse witness making an accusatory, testimonial state-\nment\u2014implicating the core concerns of the Lord Cobham-\ntype affidavits. But here the DNA report sought, not to\naccuse petitioner, but instead to generate objectively a\nprofile of a then-unknown suspect\u2019s DNA from the semen\nhe left in committing the crime. See ante, at 31\u201333.\n   Finally, to bar admission of the out-of-court records at\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Such a precedent could\nbar the admission of other reliable case-specific technical\ninformation such as, say, autopsy reports. Autopsies, like\nthe DNA report in this case, are often conducted when it is\nnot yet clear whether there is a particular suspect or\nwhether the facts found in the autopsy will ultimately\nprove relevant in a criminal trial. Autopsies are typically\nconducted soon after death. And when, say, a victim\u2019s\nbody has decomposed, repetition of the autopsy may not be\npossible. What is to happen if the medical examiner dies\nbefore trial? E.g., State v. Lackey, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/kan/ewtG/state-v-lackey/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195\u2013196,\n120 P. 3d 332, 341 (2005); see also People v. Geier, 41 Cal.\n4th 555, 601\u2013602, 161 P. 3d 104, 136\u2013137 (2007). Is the\nConfrontation Clause \u201c \u2018effectively\u2019 \u201d to function \u201c \u2018as a\nstatute of limitations for murder\u2019 \u201d? Melendez-Diaz, supra,\nat 335 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (quoting Comment, To-\nward a Definition of \u201cTestimonial\u201d: How Autopsy Reports\nDo Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement,\n96 Cal. L. Rev. 1093, 1115 (2008)).\n  In general, such a holding could also increase the risk of\nconvicting the innocent. The New York County District\nAttorney\u2019s Office and the New York City Office of the\nChief Medical Examiner tell us that the additional cost\nand complexity involved in requiring live testimony from\nperhaps dozens of ordinary laboratory technicians who\nparticipate in the preparation of a DNA profile may well\nforce a laboratory \u201cto reduce the amount of DNA testing it\nconducts, and force prosecutors to forgo forensic DNA\nanalysis in cases where it might be highly probative. In\nthe absence of DNA testing, defendants might well be\nprosecuted solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony, the\nreliability of which is often questioned.\u201d NY County DAO\nBrief 10 (citing United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 229\n(1967)); see also NDAA Brief 26 (such a holding \u201cwill also\nimpact the innocent who may wait to be cleared from\n14                 WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    BREYER, J., concurring\n\nsuspicion or exonerated from mistaken conviction\u201d). I find\nthis plausible. But cf. Innocence Network Brief 3. An\ninterpretation of the Clause that risks greater prosecution\nreliance upon less reliable evidence cannot be sound. Cf.\nMaryland v. Craig, 497 U. S. 836, 845 (1990) (\u201cThe central\nconcern of the Confrontation Clause is to ensure the reli-\nability of the evidence against a criminal defendant\u201d).\n   Consequently, I would consider reports such as the DNA\nreport before us presumptively to lie outside the perimeter\nof the Clause as established by the Court\u2019s precedents.\nSuch a holding leaves the defendant free to call the labora-\ntory employee as a witness if the employee is available.\nMoreover, should the defendant provide good reason to\ndoubt the laboratory\u2019s competence or the validity of its\naccreditation, then the alternative safeguard of reliability\nwould no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle\ndefendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Similarly,\nshould the defendant demonstrate the existence of a mo-\ntive to falsify, then the alternative safeguard of honesty\nwould no longer exist and the Constitution would entitle\nthe defendant to Confrontation Clause protection. Cf. 2\nWigmore, Evidence \u00a71527, at 1892 (in respect to the busi-\nness records exception, \u201cthere must have been no motive\nto misrepresent\u201d). Thus, the defendant would remain free\nto show the absence or inadequacy of the alternative\nreliability/honesty safeguards, thereby rebutting the pre-\nsumption and making the Confrontation Clause applicable.\nNo one has suggested any such problem in respect to\nthe Cellmark Report at issue here.\n   Because the plurality\u2019s opinion is basically consistent\nwith the views set forth here, I join that opinion in full.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Each expert\nmay make technical statements (express or implied) dur-\ning the DNA analysis process that are in turn relied upon\nby other experts. The amici dispute how many of these\nexperts the Confrontation Clause requires to be subject to\ncross-examination.

See Barber\nv. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 724\u2013725 (1968) (defining a consti-\ntutional standard for whether a witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfor purposes of the Confrontation Clause); see also Ohio v.\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56, 76 (1980) (recognizing that Barber\n\u201cexplored the issue of constitutional unavailability\u201d (em-\nphasis added)). Likewise, we have held that limiting in-\nstructions may be insufficient in some circumstances to\nprotect against violations of the Confrontation Clause.\nSee Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968).\n   Of particular importance here, we have made sure that\nan out-of-court statement was introduced for a \u201clegitimate,\nnonhearsay purpose\u201d before relying on the not-for-its-truth\nrationale to dismiss the application of the Confrontation\nClause. See Street, 471 U. S., at 417 (emphasis added). In\nStreet, the defendant testified that he gave a false confes-\nsion because police coerced him into parroting his accom-\nplice\u2019s confession. Id., at 411. On rebuttal, the prosecu-\ntion introduced the accomplice\u2019s confession to demonstrate\nto the jury the ways in which the two confessions differed.\nId., at 411\u2013412. Finding no Confrontation Clause prob-\nlem, this Court held that the accomplice\u2019s out-of-court\nconfession was not introduced for its truth, but only to\nimpeach the defendant\u2019s version of events. Id., at 413\u2013\n414. Although the Court noted that the confession was\nnot hearsay \u201cunder traditional rules of evidence,\u201d id., at\n413, the Court did not accept that nonhearsay label at face\nvalue. Instead, the Court thoroughly examined the use of\nthe out-of-court confession and the efficacy of a limiting\ninstruction before concluding that the Confrontation\nClause was satisfied \u201c[i]n this context.\u201d Id., at 417.\n   Unlike the confession in Street, statements introduced\nto explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion are not intro-\nduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose. There is no\nmeaningful distinction between disclosing an out-of-court\nstatement so that the factfinder may evaluate the expert\u2019s\nopinion and disclosing that statement for its truth. \u201cTo\nuse the inadmissible information in evaluating the ex-\npert\u2019s testimony, the jury must make a preliminary judg-\n4                       WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nment about whether this information is true.\u201d D. Kaye, D.\nBernstein, & J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: A Treatise\non Evidence: Expert Evidence \u00a74.10.1, p. 196 (2d ed. 2011)\n(hereinafter Kaye). \u201cIf the jury believes that the basis\nevidence is true, it will likely also believe that the expert\u2019s\nreliance is justified; inversely, if the jury doubts the accu-\nracy or validity of the basis evidence, it will be skeptical of\nthe expert\u2019s conclusions.\u201d Ibid.1\n  Contrary to the plurality\u2019s suggestion, this common-\nsense conclusion is not undermined by any longstand-\ning historical practice exempting expert basis testimony\nfrom the rigors of the Confrontation Clause. Prior to the\nadoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975, an\nexpert could render an opinion based only on facts that the\nexpert had personally perceived or facts that the expert\nlearned at trial, either by listening to the testimony of\nother witnesses or through a hypothetical question based\non facts in evidence. See Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes on\nFed. Rule Evid. 703, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 361; 29 C. Wright\n& V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a76271,\npp. 300\u2013301 (1997) (hereinafter Wright); 1 K. Broun et al.,\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a714, p. 86 (6th ed. 2006) (herein-\nafter Broun); Kaye \u00a74.6, at 156\u2013157. In those situations,\nthere was little danger that the expert would rely on\ntestimonial hearsay that was not subject to confrontation\nbecause the expert and the witnesses on whom he relied\nwere present at trial. It was not until 1975 that the uni-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The plurality relies heavily on the fact that this case involved a\n\nbench trial, emphasizing that a judge sitting as factfinder is pre-\nsumed\u2014more so than a jury\u2014to \u201cunderstand the limited reason for the\ndisclosure\u201d of basis testimony and to \u201cnot rely on that information for\nany improper purpose.\u201d Ante, at 15. Even accepting that presumption,\nthe point is not that the factfinder is unable to understand the restricted\npurpose for basis testimony. Instead, the point is that the purport-\nedly \u201climited reason\u201d for such testimony\u2014to aid the factfinder in\nevaluating the expert\u2019s opinion\u2014necessarily entails an evaluation of\nwhether the basis testimony is true.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nverse of facts upon which an expert could rely was ex-\npanded to include facts of the case that the expert learned\nout of court by means other than his own perception. 1\nBroun \u00a714, at 87; Kaye \u00a74.6, at 157. It is the expert\u2019s\ndisclosure of those facts that raises Confrontation Clause\nconcerns.2\n                             B\n   Those concerns are fully applicable in this case. Lamba-\ntos opined that petitioner\u2019s DNA profile matched the male\nprofile derived from L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs. In reaching\nthat conclusion, Lambatos relied on Cellmark\u2019s out-of-\ncourt statements that the profile it reported was in fact\nderived from L. J.\u2019s swabs, rather than from some other\nsource. Thus, the validity of Lambatos\u2019 opinion ultimately\nturned on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statements. The plural-\nity\u2019s assertion that Cellmark\u2019s statements were merely\nrelayed to explain \u201cthe assumptions on which [Lambatos\u2019]\nopinion rest[ed],\u201d ante, at 3, overlooks that the value of\nLambatos\u2019 testimony depended on the truth of those very\nassumptions.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In its discussion of history, the plurality relies on Beckwith v.\n\nSydebotham, 1 Camp. 116, 170 Eng. Rep. 897 (K. B. 1807). In that\ncase, experts were asked to render opinions on a ship\u2019s seaworthiness\nbased on facts read into court from the sworn ex parte deposition of a\nwitness who purported to have seen the ship\u2019s deficiencies. To be sure,\nBeckwith involved expert reliance on testimonial hearsay. But Beck-\nwith was an English case decided after the ratification of the Confron-\ntation Clause, and this form of expert testimony does not appear to\nhave been a common feature of early American evidentiary practice.\nSee 29 Wright \u00a76271, at 300\u2013301; 1 Broun \u00a714, at 86\u201387; Kaye \u00a74.6, at\n156\u2013157.\n   3 Cellmark\u2019s statements were not introduced for the nonhearsay pur-\n\npose of showing their effect on Lambatos\u2014i.e., to explain what prompted\nher to search the DNA database for a match. See, e.g., 30B M. Graham,\nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a77034.1, pp. 521\u2013529 (interim ed. 2011)\n(noting that out-of-court statements introduced for their effect on\nlistener do not implicate the Confrontation Clause). The statements\n6                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   It is no answer to say that other nonhearsay evidence\nestablished the basis of the expert\u2019s opinion. Here, Lam-\nbatos disclosed Cellmark\u2019s statements that it generated a\nmale DNA profile from L. J.\u2019s swabs, but other evidence\nshowed that L. J.\u2019s swabs contained semen and that the\nswabs were shipped to and received from Cellmark. Ante,\nat 5\u20136. That evidence did not render Cellmark\u2019s state-\nments superfluous. Of course, evidence that Cellmark\nreceived L. J.\u2019s swabs and later produced a DNA profile is\nsome indication that Cellmark in fact generated the profile\nfrom those swabs, rather than from some other source (or\nfrom no source at all). Cf. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu-\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305, 319 (2009) (citing brief that describes\n\u201ccases of documented \u2018drylabbing\u2019 where forensic analysts\nreport results of tests that were never performed,\u201d includ-\ning DNA tests). But the only direct evidence to that effect\nwas Cellmark\u2019s statement, which Lambatos relayed to the\nfactfinder. In any event, the factfinder\u2019s ability to rely on\nother evidence to evaluate an expert\u2019s opinion does not\nalter the conclusion that basis testimony is admitted for\nits truth. The existence of other evidence corroborating\nthe basis testimony may render any Confrontation Clause\nviolation harmless, but it does not change the purpose of\nsuch testimony and thereby place it outside of the reach of\nthe Confrontation Clause.4 I would thus conclude that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat Lambatos conveyed went well beyond what was necessary to\nexplain why she performed the search. Lambatos did not merely\ndisclose that she received a DNA profile from Cellmark. Rather, she\nfurther disclosed Cellmark\u2019s statements that the profile was \u201cmale\u201d and\nthat it was \u201cfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.].\u201d App. 56.\nThose facts had nothing to do with her decision to conduct a search.\nThey were introduced for their truth.\n  4 The plurality concludes that the Confrontation Clause would not\n\nbe implicated here \u201ceven if the record did not contain any [other] evi-\ndence that could rationally support a finding that Cellmark produced a\nscientifically reliable DNA profile based on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab.\u201d Ante,\nat 22. But, far from establishing a \u201clegitimate\u201d nonhearsay purpose for\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCellmark\u2019s statements were introduced for their truth.\n                              C\n   The plurality\u2019s contrary conclusion may seem of little\nconsequence to those who view DNA testing and other\nforms of \u201chard science\u201d as intrinsically reliable. But see\nMelendez-Diaz, supra, at 318 (\u201cForensic evidence is not\nuniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\u201d). Today\u2019s\nholding, however, will reach beyond scientific evidence to\nordinary out-of-court statements. For example, it is not\nuncommon for experts to rely on interviews with third\nparties in forming their opinions. See, e.g., People v. Gold-\nstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119, 123\u2013124, 843 N. E. 2d 727, 729\u2013730\n(2005) (psychiatrist disclosed statements made by the\ndefendant\u2019s acquaintances as part of the basis of her opin-\nion that the defendant was motivated to kill by his feelings\nof sexual frustration).\n   It is no answer to say that \u201csafeguards\u201d in the rules of\nevidence will prevent the abuse of basis testimony. Ante,\nat 26. To begin with, courts may be willing to conclude\nthat an expert is not acting as a \u201cmere condui[t]\u201d for hear-\nsay, ante, at 27, as long as he simply provides some opin-\nion based on that hearsay. See Brief for Respondent 18,\nn. 4 (collecting cases). In addition, the hearsay may be the\nkind of fact on which experts in a field reasonably rely.\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 703; Goldstein, supra, at 125, 843\nN. E. 2d, at 731 (evidence showed that reputable psychia-\ntrists relied upon third-party interviews in forming their\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCellmark\u2019s statements, Tennessee v. Street, 471 U. S. 409, 417 (1985), a\ncomplete lack of other evidence tending to prove the facts conveyed by\nCellmark\u2019s statements would completely refute the not-for-its-truth\nrationale. The trial court, in announcing its verdict, expressly concluded\nthat petitioner\u2019s DNA matched the \u201cDNA . . . in the semen recovered\nfrom the victim\u2019s vagina.\u201d 4 R. JJJ151. Absent other evidence, it would\nhave been impossible for the trial court to reach that conclusion with-\nout relying on the truth of Cellmark\u2019s statement that its test results\nwere based on the semen from L. J.\u2019s swabs.\n8                   WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nopinions). Of course, some courts may determine that\nhearsay of this sort is not substantially more probative\nthan prejudicial and therefore should not be disclosed un-\nder Rule 703. But that balancing test is no substitute\nfor a constitutional provision that has already struck the\nbalance in favor of the accused. See Crawford, 541 U. S.,\nat 61 (\u201c[The Confrontation Clause] commands, not that\nevidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a\nparticular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-\nexamination\u201d).\n                                II\n\n                                  \n\n                                A\n\n   Having concluded that the statements at issue here\nwere introduced for their truth, I turn to whether they\nwere \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the Confrontation\nClause. In Crawford, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he text\nof the Confrontation Clause . . . applies to \u2018witnesses\u2019\nagainst the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear\ntestimony.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An Ameri-\ncan Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). \u201c \u2018Testi-\nmony,\u2019 \u201d in turn, is \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation\nmade for the purpose of establishing or proving some\nfact.\u2019 \u201d 541 U. S., at 51. In light of its text, I continue to\nthink that the Confrontation Clause regulates only the use\nof statements bearing \u201cindicia of solemnity.\u201d Davis v.\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813, 836\u2013837, 840 (2006) (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nThis test comports with history because solemnity marked\nthe practices that the Confrontation Clause was designed\nto eliminate, namely, the ex parte examination of wit-\nnesses under the English bail and committal statutes passed\nduring the reign of Queen Mary. See id., at 835; Bryant,\n562 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 1); Crawford, supra, at 43\u201345. Accordingly, I\nhave concluded that the Confrontation Clause reaches\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                 THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201c \u2018formalized testimonial materials,\u2019 \u201d such as depositions,\naffidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting\nfrom \u201c \u2018formalized dialogue,\u2019 \u201d such as custodial interroga-\ntion. Bryant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2); see also Davis,\nsupra, at 836\u2013837.5\n    Applying these principles, I conclude that Cellmark\u2019s\nreport is not a statement by a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d within the mean-\ning of the Confrontation Clause. The Cellmark report\nlacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is\nneither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact. No-\nwhere does the report attest that its statements accurately\nreflect the DNA testing processes used or the results ob-\ntained. See Report of Laboratory Examination, Lodging\nof Petitioner. The report is signed by two \u201creviewers,\u201d but\nthey neither purport to have performed the DNA testing\nnor certify the accuracy of those who did. See ibid. And,\nalthough the report was produced at the request of law\nenforcement, it was not the product of any sort of formal-\nized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.\n    The Cellmark report is distinguishable from the labora-\ntory reports that we determined were testimonial in\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S. 305, and in Bullcoming v. New\nMexico, 564 U. S. ___ (2011). In Melendez-Diaz, the re-\nports in question were \u201csworn to before a notary public\nby [the] analysts\u201d who tested a substance for cocaine. 557\nU. S., at 308. In Bullcoming, the report, though unsworn,\nincluded a \u201cCertificate of Analyst\u201d signed by the forensic\nanalyst who tested the defendant\u2019s blood sample. 564\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The analyst \u201caffirmed that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 In addition, I have stated that, because the Confrontation Clause\n\n\u201csought to regulate prosecutorial abuse occurring through use of\nex parte statements,\u201d it \u201calso reaches the use of technically informal\nstatements when used to evade the formalized process.\u201d Davis, 547\nU. S., at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart). But, in this case, there is no indication that Cellmark\u2019s state-\nments were offered \u201cin order to evade confrontation.\u201d Id., at 840.\n10                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u2018[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken\nin the laboratory,\u2019 that \u2018the statements in [the analyst\u2019s\nblock of the report] are correct,\u2019 and that he had \u2018followed\nthe procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid.\n   The dissent insists that the Bullcoming report and\nCellmark\u2019s report are equally formal, separated only by\nsuch \u201cminutia\u201d as the fact that Cellmark\u2019s report \u201cis not\nlabeled a \u2018certificate.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22\u201323 (opinion of KAGAN,\nJ.). To the contrary, what distinguishes the two is that\nCellmark\u2019s report, in substance, certifies nothing. See su-\npra, at 9. That distinction is constitutionally significant\nbecause the scope of the confrontation right is properly\nlimited to extrajudicial statements similar in solemnity to\nthe Marian examination practices that the Confrontation\nClause was designed to prevent. See Davis, supra, at 835\u2013\n836 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). By certifying the truth of the\nanalyst\u2019s representations, the unsworn Bullcoming report\nbore \u201ca \u2018striking resemblance,\u2019 \u201d 547 U. S., at 837 (quot-\ning Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52), to the Marian practice in\nwhich magistrates examined witnesses, typically on oath,\nand \u201ccertif[ied] the results to the court.\u201d Id., at 44. And,\nin Melendez-Diaz, we observed that \u201c \u2018certificates\u2019 are\nfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing\nprecisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u201d 557\nU. S., at 310\u2013311. Cellmark\u2019s report is marked by no such\nindicia of solemnity.\n   Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, acknowledging\nthat the Confrontation Clause is implicated only by for-\nmalized statements that are characterized by solemnity\nwill not result in a prosecutorial conspiracy to elude con-\nfrontation by using only informal extrajudicial statements\nagainst an accused. As I have previously noted, the Con-\nfrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the\nformalized process. See supra, at 9, n. 5 (quoting Davis,\n547 U. S., at 838). Moreover, the prosecution\u2019s use of\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninformal statements comes at a price. As the dissent\nrecognizes, such statements are \u201cless reliable\u201d than for-\nmalized statements, post, at 24, and therefore less persua-\nsive to the factfinder. Cf. post, at 21\u201322, n. 6 (arguing that\nprosecutors are unlikely to \u201cforgo DNA evidence in favor of\nless reliable eyewitness testimony\u201d simply because the\ndefendant is entitled to confront the DNA analyst). But,\neven assuming that the dissent accurately predicts an\nupswing in the use of \u201cless reliable\u201d informal statements,\nthat result does not \u201cturn the Confrontation Clause upside\ndown.\u201d Post, at 24. The Confrontation Clause does not\nrequire that evidence be reliable, Crawford, supra, at 61,\nbut that the reliability of a specific \u201cclass of testimonial\nstatements\u201d\u2014formalized statements bearing indicia of\nsolemnity\u2014be assessed through cross-examination. See\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 309\u2013310.\n                             B\n   Rather than apply the foregoing principles, the plurality\ninvokes its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test. The original formula-\ntion of that test asked whether the primary purpose of an\nextrajudicial statement was \u201cto establish or prove past\nevents potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d\nDavis, supra, at 822. I agree that, for a statement to be\ntestimonial within the meaning of the Confrontation\nClause, the declarant must primarily intend to establish\nsome fact with the understanding that his statement may\nbe used in a criminal prosecution. See Bryant, 562 U. S.,\nat ___ (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2\u20133). But this\nnecessary criterion is not sufficient, for it sweeps into the\nambit of the Confrontation Clause statements that lack\nformality and solemnity and is thus \u201cdisconnected from\nhistory.\u201d Davis, supra, at 838\u2013842 (opinion concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); Bryant, supra, at\n___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1). In\naddition, a primary purpose inquiry divorced from solem-\n12                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnity is unworkable in practice. Davis, supra, at 839; Bry-\nant, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 1). Statements to police are\noften made both to resolve an ongoing emergency and to\nestablish facts about a crime for potential prosecution.\nThe primary purpose test gives courts no principled way to\nassign primacy to one of those purposes. Davis, supra, at\n839. The solemnity requirement is not only true to the\ntext and history of the Confrontation Clause, but goes a\nlong way toward resolving that practical difficulty. If a\nstatement bears the formality and solemnity necessary to\ncome within the scope of the Clause, it is highly unlikely\nthat the statement was primarily made to end an ongoing\nemergency.\n  The shortcomings of the original primary purpose test\npale in comparison, however, to those plaguing the refor-\nmulated version that the plurality suggests today. The\nnew primary purpose test asks whether an out-of-court\nstatement has \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted\nindividual of engaging in criminal conduct.\u201d Ante, at 29.\nThat test lacks any grounding in constitutional text, in\nhistory, or in logic.\n  The new test first requires that an out-of-court state-\nment be made \u201cfor the purpose of proving the guilt of\na particular criminal defendant.\u201d Ante, at 30 (emphasis\nadded). Under this formulation, statements made \u201cbefore\nany suspect was identified\u201d are beyond the scope of the\nConfrontation Clause. See ante, at 3. There is no textual\njustification, however, for limiting the confrontation right\nto statements made after the accused\u2019s identity became\nknown. To be sure, the Sixth Amendment right to con-\nfrontation attaches \u201c[i]n . . . criminal prosecutions,\u201d at\nwhich time the accused has been identified and appre-\nhended. But the text of the Confrontation Clause does not\nconstrain the time at which one becomes a \u201cwitnes[s].\u201d\nIndeed, we have previously held that a declarant may\nbecome a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d before the accused\u2019s prosecution. See\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             13\n\n                THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nCrawford, 541 U. S., at 50\u201351 (rejecting the view that the\nConfrontation Clause applies only to in-court testimony).\n  Historical practice confirms that a declarant could\nbecome a \u201cwitnes[s]\u201d before the accused\u2019s identity was\nknown. As previously noted, the confrontation right was\na response to ex parte examinations of witnesses in 16th-\ncentury England. Such examinations often occurred after\nan accused was arrested or bound over for trial, but some\nexaminations occurred while the accused remained \u201cun-\nknown or fugitive.\u201d J. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the\nRenaissance 90 (1974) (describing examples, including the\ndeposition of a victim who was swindled out of 20 shillings\nby a \u201c \u2018cunning man\u2019 \u201d); see also 1 J. Stephen, A History of\nthe Criminal Law of England 217\u2013218 (1883) (describ-\ning the sworn examinations of witnesses by coroners, who\nwere charged with investigating suspicious deaths by\nasking local citizens if they knew \u201cwho [was] culpable\neither of the act or of the force\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n  There is also little logical justification for the plurality\u2019s\nrule. The plurality characterizes Cellmark\u2019s report as a\nstatement elicited by police and made by Cellmark not \u201cto\naccuse petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial,\u201d but\nrather to resolve the ongoing emergency posed by \u201ca dan-\ngerous rapist who was still at large.\u201d Ante, at 31. But, as\nI have explained, that distinction is unworkable in light of\nthe mixed purposes that often underlie statements to the\npolice. See supra, at 12. The difficulty is only compound-\ned by the plurality\u2019s attempt to merge the purposes of both\nthe police and the declarant. See ante, at 29; Bryant,\nsupra, at ___\u2013___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 20\u201323).\n  But if one purpose must prevail, here it should surely be\nthe evidentiary one, whether viewed from the perspective\nof the police, Cellmark, or both. The police confirmed the\npresence of semen on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs on February 15,\n2000, placed the swabs in a freezer, and waited until\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nNovember 28, 2000, to ship them to Cellmark. App. 30\u2013\n34, 51\u201352. Cellmark, in turn, did not send its report to\nthe police until April 3, 2001, id., at 54, over a year\nafter L. J.\u2019s rape. Given this timeline, it strains credulity\nto assert that the police and Cellmark were primarily\nconcerned with the exigencies of an ongoing emergency,\nrather than with producing evidence in the ordinary course.\n   In addition to requiring that an out-of-court statement\n\u201ctarge[t]\u201d a particular accused, the plurality\u2019s new primary\npurpose test also considers whether the statement is so\n\u201cinherently inculpatory,\u201d ante, at 3, that the declarant\nshould have known that his statement would incriminate\nthe accused. In this case, the plurality asserts that \u201c[t]he\ntechnicians who prepare a DNA profile generally have no\nway of knowing whether it will turn out to be incriminat-\ning or exonerating\u2014or both,\u201d ante, at 32, and thus \u201cno one\nat Cellmark could have possibly known that the profile\nthat it produced would turn out to inculpate petitioner,\u201d\nante, at 31.\n   Again, there is no textual justification for this limitation\non the scope of the Confrontation Clause. In Melendez-\nDiaz, we held that \u201c[t]he text of the [Sixth] Amendment\ncontemplates two classes of witnesses\u2014those against the\ndefendant and those in his favor.\u201d 557 U. S., at 313\u2013314.\nWe emphasized that \u201cthere is not a third category of wit-\nnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune\nfrom confrontation.\u201d Id., at 314. Thus, the distinction\nbetween those who make \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d state-\nments and those who make other statements that are\nmerely \u201chelpful to the prosecution\u201d has no foundation in\nthe text of the Amendment.\n   It is also contrary to history. The 16th-century Marian\nstatutes instructed magistrates to transcribe any infor-\nmation by witnesses that \u201c \u2018shall be material to prove the\nfelony.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g., 1 Stephen, supra, at 219 (quoting 1 & 2\nPhil. & Mary, ch. 13 (1554)). Magistrates in the 17th and\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

J. Beattie, Crime\nand the Courts in England: 1660\u20131800, p. 272 (1986)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, neither law nor\npractice limited ex parte examinations to those witnesses\nwho made \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d statements.\n   This requirement also makes little sense. A statement\nthat is not facially inculpatory may turn out to be highly\nprobative of a defendant\u2019s guilt when considered with\nother evidence. Recognizing this point, we previously\nrejected the view that a witness is not subject to confron-\ntation if his testimony is \u201cinculpatory only when taken\ntogether with other evidence.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, supra, at\n313. I see no justification for reviving that discredited\napproach, and the plurality offers none.6\n                          *      *     *\n   Respondent and its amici have emphasized the econom-\nic and logistical burdens that would be visited upon States\nshould every analyst who reports DNA results be required\nto testify at trial. See, e.g., ante, at 32 (citing brief stating\nthat some crime labs use up to 12 technicians when test-\ning a DNA sample). These burdens are largely the prod-\nuct of a primary purpose test that reaches out-of-court\nstatements well beyond the historical scope of the Con-\nfrontation Clause and thus sweeps in a broad range of\nsources on which modern experts regularly rely.

Melendez-Diaz rejected this reasoning as well,\nholding that the defendant\u2019s subpoena power \u201cis no substitute for the\nright of confrontation.\u201d 557 U.

See ante, at 3. Nor is it to\ncreate a new primary purpose test that ensures that DNA\nevidence is treated differently. See ibid. Rather, the\nsolution is to adopt a reading of the Confrontation Clause\nthat respects its historically limited application to a nar-\nrow class of statements bearing indicia of solemnity. In\nforgoing that approach, today\u2019s decision diminishes the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s protection in cases where experts\nconvey the contents of solemn, formalized statements to\nexplain the bases for their opinions.

At a preliminary hear-\ning, the State presented testimony from an analyst at the\nCellmark Diagnostics Laboratory\u2014the same facility used\nto generate DNA evidence in this case. The analyst had\nextracted DNA from a bloody sweatshirt found at the\ncrime scene and then compared it to two control samples\u2014\none from Kocak and one from the victim. The analyst\u2019s\nreport identified a single match: As she explained on\ndirect examination, the DNA found on the sweatshirt\nbelonged to Kocak.          But after undergoing cross-\nexamination, the analyst realized she had made a mortify-\ning error. She took the stand again, but this time to admit\nthat the report listed the victim\u2019s control sample as coming\nfrom Kocak, and Kocak\u2019s as coming from the victim. So\nthe DNA on the sweatshirt matched not Kocak, but the\nvictim herself. See Tr. in No. SCD110465 (Super. Ct. San\nDiego Cty., Cal., Nov. 17, 1995), pp. 3\u20134 (\u201cI\u2019m a little hys-\nterical right now, but I think . . . the two names should be\nswitched\u201d), online at http: //www.nlada.org/forensics/for_\nlib/Documents/1037341561.0/JohnIvanKocak.pdf (as vis-\nited June 15, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile). In trying Kocak, the State would have to look else-\nwhere for its evidence.\n2                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                    KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Our Constitution contains a mechanism for catching\nsuch errors\u2014the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation\nClause. That Clause, and the Court\u2019s recent cases inter-\npreting it, require that testimony against a criminal de-\nfendant be subject to cross-examination. And that com-\nmand applies with full force to forensic evidence of the\nkind involved in both the Kocak case and this one. In two\ndecisions issued in the last three years, this Court held\nthat if a prosecutor wants to introduce the results of fo-\nrensic testing into evidence, he must afford the defendant\nan opportunity to cross-examine an analyst responsible for\nthe test. Forensic evidence is reliable only when properly\nproduced, and the Confrontation Clause prescribes a par-\nticular method for determining whether that has hap-\npened. The Kocak incident illustrates how the Clause is\ndesigned to work: Once confronted, the analyst discovered\nand disclosed the error she had made. That error would\nprobably not have come to light if the prosecutor had\nmerely admitted the report into evidence or asked a third\nparty to present its findings. Hence the genius of an 18th-\ncentury device as applied to 21st-century evidence: Cross-\nexamination of the analyst is especially likely to reveal\nwhether vials have been switched, samples contaminated,\ntests incompetently run, or results inaccurately recorded.\n   Under our Confrontation Clause precedents, this is\nan open-and-shut case. The State of Illinois prosecuted\nSandy Williams for rape based in part on a DNA profile\ncreated in Cellmark\u2019s laboratory. Yet the State did not\ngive Williams a chance to question the analyst who pro-\nduced that evidence. Instead, the prosecution introduced\nthe results of Cellmark\u2019s testing through an expert wit-\nness who had no idea how they were generated. That\napproach\u2014no less (perhaps more) than the confrontation-\nfree methods of presenting forensic evidence we have\nformerly banned\u2014deprived Williams of his Sixth Amend-\nment right to \u201cconfron[t] . . . the witnesses against him.\u201d\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   The Court today disagrees, though it cannot settle on a\nreason why. JUSTICE ALITO, joined by three other Jus-\ntices, advances two theories\u2014that the expert\u2019s summary of\nthe Cellmark report was not offered for its truth, and\nthat the report is not the kind of statement triggering the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s protection. In the pages that\nfollow, I call JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s opinion \u201cthe plurality,\u201d\nbecause that is the conventional term for it. But in all\nexcept its disposition, his opinion is a dissent: Five Jus-\ntices specifically reject every aspect of its reasoning\nand every paragraph of its explication. See ante, at 1\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cI share the dis-\nsent\u2019s view of the plurality\u2019s flawed analysis\u201d). JUSTICE\nTHOMAS, for his part, contends that the Cellmark report\nis nontestimonial on a different rationale. But no other\nJustice joins his opinion or subscribes to the test he offers.\n   That creates five votes to approve the admission of the\nCellmark report, but not a single good explanation. The\nplurality\u2019s first rationale endorses a prosecutorial dodge;\nits second relies on distinguishing indistinguishable foren-\nsic reports. JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s concurrence, though posit-\ning an altogether different approach, suffers in the end\nfrom similar flaws. I would choose another path\u2014to\nadhere to the simple rule established in our decisions, for\nthe good reasons we have previously given. Because de-\nfendants like Williams have a constitutional right to con-\nfront the witnesses against them, I respectfully dissent\nfrom the Court\u2019s fractured decision.\n                            I\n  Our modern Confrontation Clause doctrine began with\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004). About a\nquarter century earlier, we had interpreted the Clause to\nallow the admission of any out-of-court statement falling\nwithin a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or carrying\n\u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Ohio v.\n4                    WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nRoberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66 (1980). But in Crawford, we\nconcluded that our old approach was misguided. Drawing\non historical research about the Clause\u2019s purposes, we\nheld that the prosecution may not admit \u201ctestimonial\nstatements of a witness who [does] not appear at trial\nunless he [is] unavailable to testify, and the defendant . . .\nhad a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d 541 U. S.,\nat 53\u201354. That holding has two aspects. First, the Con-\nfrontation Clause applies only to out-of-court statements\nthat are \u201ctestimonial.\u201d Second, where the Clause applies,\nit guarantees to a defendant just what its name sug-\ngests\u2014the opportunity to cross-examine the person who\nmade the statement. See id., at 59.\n    A few years later, we made clear that Crawford\u2019s rule\nreaches forensic reports. In Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu\u00ad\n\nsetts, 557 U. S. 305 (2009), the Commonwealth introduced\na laboratory\u2019s \u201c \u2018certificates of analysis\u2019 \u201d stating that a sub-\nstance seized from the defendant was cocaine. Id., at\n308. We held that the certificates fell within the Clause\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018core class of testimonial statements\u2019 \u201d because they had\na clear \u201cevidentiary purpose\u201d: They were \u201c \u2018made under\ncircumstances which would lead an objective witness\nreasonably to believe that [they] would be available for use\nat a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 310\u2013311 (quoting Crawford, 541\nU. S., at 51\u201352). Accordingly, we ruled, the defendant had\na right to cross-examine the analysts who had authored\nthem.      In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the\nCommonwealth\u2019s argument that the Confrontation Clause\nshould not apply because the statements resulted from\n\u201c \u2018neutral scientific testing,\u2019 \u201d and so were presumptively\nreliable. 557 U. S., at 318. The Clause, we noted,\ncommands that \u201c \u2018reliability be assessed in a particular\nmanner\u2019 \u201d\u2014through \u201c \u2018testing in the crucible of cross-\nexamination.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 317 (quoting Crawford, 541 U. S., at\n61). Further, we doubted that the testing summarized\nin the certificates was \u201cas neutral or as reliable\u201d as the\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nCommonwealth suggested. Citing chapter and verse from\nvarious studies, we concluded that \u201c[f]orensic evidence is\nnot uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation\u201d and\nmistake. 557 U. S., at 318; see id., at 319.\n   And just two years later (and just one year ago), we\nreiterated Melendez-Diaz\u2019s analysis when faced with a\nState\u2019s attempt to evade it. In Bullcoming v. New Mexico,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), a forensic report showed the defend-\nant\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration to exceed the legal limit\nfor drivers. The State tried to introduce that finding\nthrough the testimony of a person who worked at the\nlaboratory but had not performed or observed the blood\ntest or certified its results. We held that Melendez-Diaz\nforeclosed that tactic. The report, we stated, resembled\nthe certificates in Melendez-Diaz in \u201call material respects,\u201d\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15): Both were signed docu-\nments providing the results of forensic testing designed to\n\u201c \u2018prov[e] some fact\u2019 in a criminal proceeding,\u201d id., at ___\n(slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310).\nAnd the State\u2019s resort to a \u201csurrogate\u201d witness, in place\nof the analyst who produced the report, did not satisfy the\nConfrontation Clause. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12). Only the presence of \u201cthat particular scientist,\u201d\nwe reasoned, would enable Bullcoming\u2019s counsel to ask\n\u201cquestions designed to reveal whether incompetence . . . or\ndishonesty\u201d had tainted the results. Id., at ___, ___ (slip\nop., at 2, 12). Repeating the refrain of Melendez-Diaz, we\nheld that \u201c[t]he accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with\u201d\nthe actual analyst, unless he is unavailable and the ac-\ncused \u201chad an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine\u201d\nhim. Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).\n   This case is of a piece. The report at issue here shows a\nDNA profile produced by an analyst at Cellmark\u2019s labora-\ntory, allegedly from a vaginal swab taken from a young\nwoman, L. J., after she was raped. That report is identical\nto the one in Bullcoming (and Melendez-Diaz) in \u201call mate-\n6                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nrial respects.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Once\nagain, the report was made to establish \u201c \u2018some fact\u2019 in a\ncriminal proceeding\u201d\u2014here, the identity of L. J.\u2019s attacker.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557\nU. S., at 310); see infra, at 20. And once again, it details\nthe results of forensic testing on evidence gathered by the\npolice. Viewed side-by-side with the Bullcoming report,\nthe Cellmark analysis has a comparable title; similarly\ndescribes the relevant samples, test methodology, and\nresults; and likewise includes the signatures of laboratory\nofficials. Compare Cellmark Diagnostics Report of Labor-\natory Examination (Feb. 15, 2001), Lodging of Petitioner\nwith App. in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, O. T. 2010, No.\n09\u201310876, pp. 62\u201365. So under this Court\u2019s prior analysis,\nthe substance of the report could come into evidence only\nif Williams had a chance to cross-examine the responsible\nanalyst.\n   But that is not what happened. Instead, the prosecutor\nused Sandra Lambatos\u2014a state-employed scientist who\nhad not participated in the testing\u2014as the conduit for this\npiece of evidence. Lambatos came to the stand after two\nother state analysts testified about forensic tests they had\nperformed. One recounted how she had developed a DNA\nprofile of Sandy Williams from a blood sample drawn after\nhis arrest. And another told how he had confirmed the\npresence of (unidentified) semen on the vaginal swabs\ntaken from L. J. All this was by the book: Williams had\nan opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses about the\ntests they had run. But of course, the State still needed to\nsupply the missing link\u2014it had to show that DNA found\nin the semen on L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs matched Williams\u2019s\nDNA. To fill that gap, the prosecutor could have called the\nanalyst from Cellmark to testify about the DNA profile she\nhad produced from the swabs. But instead, the State\ncalled Lambatos as an expert witness and had her testify\nthat the semen on those swabs contained Sandy Wil-\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

Lambatos\u2019s\ntestimony is functionally identical to the \u201csurrogate testi-\nmony\u201d that New Mexico proffered in Bullcoming, which\ndid nothing to cure the problem identified in Melendez-\nDiaz (which, for its part, straightforwardly applied our\ndecision in Crawford).

E.\n2d 268, 282 (2010). The plurality wraps itself in that\nholding, similarly asserting that Lambatos\u2019s recitation of\nCellmark\u2019s findings, when viewed through the prism of\nstate evidence law, was not introduced to establish \u201cthe\ntruth of any . . . matter concerning [the] Cellmark\u201d report.\nAnte, at 16; see ante, at 2, 24\u201325. But five Justices agree,\nin two opinions reciting the same reasons, that this\nargument has no merit: Lambatos\u2019s statements about\nCellmark\u2019s report went to its truth, and the State could\nnot rely on her status as an expert to circumvent the\nConfrontation Clause\u2019s requirements. See ante, at 2\u20138\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n  To see why, start with the kind of case Crawford had in\nmind. In acknowledging the not-for-the-truth carveout\nfrom the Clause, the Court cited Tennessee v. Street as\nexemplary. See Crawford, 541 U. S., at 59\u201360, n. 9.\nThere, Street claimed that his stationhouse confession of\nmurder was a sham: A police officer, he charged, had read\naloud his alleged accomplice\u2019s confession and forced him to\nrepeat it. To help rebut that defense, the State introduced\nthe other confession into the record, so the jury could see\nhow it differed from Street\u2019s. This Court rejected Street\u2019s\nConfrontation Clause claim because the State had offered\nthe out-of-court statement not to prove \u201cthe truth of\n[the accomplice\u2019s] assertions\u201d about the murder, but only to\ndisprove Street\u2019s claim of how the police elicited his con-\nfession. Street, 471 U. S., at 413. Otherwise said, the\ntruth of the admitted statement was utterly immaterial;\nthe only thing that mattered was that the statement\n(whether true or false) varied from Street\u2019s.\n  The situation could not be more different when a wit-\nness, expert or otherwise, repeats an out-of-court state-\n10                      WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nment as the basis for a conclusion, because the statement\u2019s\nutility is then dependent on its truth. If the statement is\ntrue, then the conclusion based on it is probably true; if\nnot, not. So to determine the validity of the witness\u2019s\nconclusion, the factfinder must assess the truth of the out-\nof-court statement on which it relies. That is why the\nprincipal modern treatise on evidence variously calls the\nidea that such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d comes in not for its truth,\nbut only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert\u2019s opin-\nion \u201cvery weak,\u201d \u201cfactually implausible,\u201d \u201cnonsense,\u201d and\n\u201csheer fiction.\u201d D.

Goldstein, 6 N. Y. 3d 119,\n128, 843 N.

Unlike in Street, admission of the out-of-court\nstatement in this context has no purpose separate from its\ntruth; the factfinder can do nothing with it except assess\nits truth and so the credibility of the conclusion it serves to\nbuttress.1\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In responding to this reasoning, the plurality confirms it. According\n\nto the plurality, basis evidence supports the \u201ccredibility of the expert\u2019s\nopinion\u201d by showing that he has relied on, and drawn logical inferences\nfrom, sound \u201cfactual premises.\u201d Ante, at 24. Quite right. And that\nprocess involves assessing such premises\u2019 truth: If they are, as the\nplurality puts it, \u201cunsupported by other evidence in the record\u201d or\notherwise baseless, they will not \u201callay [a factfinder\u2019s] fears\u201d about an\n\u201cexpert\u2019s reasoning.\u201d Ante, at 24\u201325. I could not have said it any\nbetter.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   Consider a prosaic example not involving scientific ex-\nperts. An eyewitness tells a police officer investigating\nan assault that the perpetrator had an unusual, star-\nshaped birthmark over his left eye. The officer arrests a\nperson bearing that birthmark (let\u2019s call him Starr) for\ncommitting the offense. And at trial, the officer takes the\nstand and recounts just what the eyewitness told him.\nPresumably the plurality would agree that such testimony\nviolates the Confrontation Clause unless the eyewitness is\nunavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to\ncross-examine him. Now ask whether anything changes if\nthe officer couches his testimony in the following way: \u201cI\nconcluded that Starr was the assailant because a reliable\neyewitness told me that the assailant had a star-shaped\nbirthmark and, look, Starr has one just like that.\u201d Surely\nthat framing would make no constitutional difference,\neven though the eyewitness\u2019s statement now explains the\nbasis for the officer\u2019s conclusion. It remains the case that\nthe prosecution is attempting to introduce a testimonial\nstatement that has no relevance to the proceedings apart\nfrom its truth\u2014and that the defendant cannot cross-\nexamine the person who made it. Allowing the admission\nof this evidence would end-run the Confrontation Clause,\nand make a parody of its strictures.\n   And that example, when dressed in scientific clothing, is\nno different from this case. The Cellmark report identified\nthe rapist as having a particular DNA profile (think of\nit as the quintessential birthmark). The Confrontation\nClause prevented the State from introducing that report\ninto evidence except by calling to the stand the person who\nprepared it. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310\u2013311;\nBullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). So the State\ntried another route\u2014introducing the substance of the re-\nport as part and parcel of an expert witness\u2019s conclusion.\nIn effect, Lambatos testified (like the police officer above):\n\u201cI concluded that Williams was the rapist because Cell-\n12                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmark, an accredited and trustworthy laboratory, says\nthat the rapist has a particular DNA profile and, look,\nWilliams has an identical one.\u201d And here too, that form\nof testimony should change nothing. The use of the\nCellmark statement remained bound up with its truth,\nand the statement came into evidence without any oppor-\ntunity for Williams to cross-examine the person who made\nit. So if the plurality were right, the State would have a\nready method to bypass the Constitution (as much as in\nmy hypothetical case); a wink and a nod, and the Confron-\ntation Clause would not pose a bar to forensic evidence.\n   The plurality tries to make plausible its not-for-the-\ntruth rationale by rewriting Lambatos\u2019s testimony about\nthe Cellmark report. According to the plurality, Lambatos\nmerely \u201cassumed\u201d that Cellmark\u2019s DNA profile came from\nL. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs, accepting for the sake of argument\nthe prosecutor\u2019s premise. Ante, at 18. But that is incor-\nrect. Nothing in Lambatos\u2019s testimony indicates that she\nwas making an assumption or considering a hypothesis.\nTo the contrary, Lambatos affirmed, without qualification,\nthat the Cellmark report showed a \u201cmale DNA profile\nfound in semen from the vaginal swabs of [L. J.].\u201d App.\n56. Had she done otherwise, this case would be different.\nThere was nothing wrong with Lambatos\u2019s testifying that\ntwo DNA profiles\u2014the one shown in the Cellmark report\nand the one derived from Williams\u2019s blood\u2014matched each\nother; that was a straightforward application of Lamba-\ntos\u2019s expertise. Similarly, Lambatos could have added\nthat if the Cellmark report resulted from scientifically\nsound testing of L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab, then it would link\nWilliams to the assault. What Lambatos could not do was\nwhat she did: indicate that the Cellmark report was pro-\nduced in this way by saying that L. J.\u2019s vaginal swab\ncontained DNA matching Williams\u2019s.2 By testifying in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 The   plurality suggests that Lambatos\u2019s testimony is merely a mod-\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We\nhave held that the Confrontation Clause requires some-\nthing more.\n   The plurality also argues that Lambatos\u2019s characteriza-\ntion of the Cellmark report did not violate the Confronta-\ntion Clause because the case \u201cinvolve[d] a bench trial.\u201d\nAnte, at 19 (emphasis deleted). I welcome the plurality\u2019s\nconcession that the Clause might forbid presenting Lam-\nbatos\u2019s statement to a jury, see ante, at 18\u201319; it indicates\nthat the plurality realizes that her testimony went beyond\nan \u201cassumption.\u201d But the presence of a judge does not\ntransform the constitutional question. In applying the\nConfrontation Clause, we have never before considered\nrelevant the decisionmaker\u2019s identity. See, e.g., Davis v.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nern, streamlined way of answering hypothetical questions and therefore\nraises no constitutional issue, see ante, at 2, 13\u201315; similarly, the\nplurality contends that the difference between what Lambatos said and\nwhat I would allow involves only \u201cslightly revis[ing]\u201d her testimony and\nso can be of no consequence, see ante, at 18, n. 3. But the statement \u201cif\nX is true, then Y follows\u201d differs materially\u2014and constitutionally\u2014\nfrom the statement \u201cY is true because X is true (according to Z).\u201d The\nformer statement is merely a logical proposition, whose validity the\ndefendant can contest by questioning the speaker. And then, assum-\ning the prosecutor tries to prove the statement\u2019s premise through some\nother witness, the defendant can rebut that effort through cross-\nexamination. By contrast, the latter statement as well contains a\nfactual allegation (that X is true), which the defendant can only effec-\ntively challenge by confronting the person who made it (Z). That is why\nrecognizing the difference between these two forms of testimony is not\nto insist on an archaism or a formality, but to ensure, in line with the\nConstitution, that defendants have the ability to confront their accus-\ners. And if prosecutors can easily conform their conduct to that consti-\ntutional directive, as the plurality suggests, so much the better: I would\nnot have thought it a ground of complaint that the Confrontation\nClause, properly understood, manages to protect defendants without\noverly burdening the State.\n14                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nWashington, 547 U. S. 813 (2006). And this case would\nbe a poor place to begin. Lambatos\u2019s description of the\nCellmark report was offered for its truth because that is\nall such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d can be offered for; as described\nearlier, the only way the factfinder could consider whether\nthat statement supported her opinion (that the DNA on\nL. J.\u2019s swabs came from Williams) was by assessing the\nstatement\u2019s truth. See supra, at 9\u201312. That is so, as a\nsimple matter of logic, whether the factfinder is a judge or\na jury. And thus, in either case, admission of the state-\nment, without the opportunity to cross-examine, violates\nthe Confrontation Clause. See ante, at 3\u20134, n. 1 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.).\n   In saying that much, I do not doubt that a judge typi-\ncally will do better than a jury in excluding such inadmis-\nsible evidence from his decisionmaking process. Perhaps\nthe judge did so here; perhaps, as the plurality thinks, he un-\nderstood that he could not consider Lambatos\u2019s repre-\nsentation about the Cellmark report, and found that other,\n\u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d established \u201cthe source of the\nsample that Cellmark tested\u201d and \u201cthe reliability of the\nCellmark profile.\u201d See ante, at 22\u201323. Some indications\nare to the contrary: In delivering his verdict, the judge\nnever referred to the circumstantial evidence the plurality\nmarshals, but instead focused only on Lambatos\u2019s testi-\nmony. See 4 Record JJJ151 (calling Lambatos \u201cthe best\nDNA witness I have ever heard\u201d and referring to Williams\nas \u201cthe guy whose DNA, according to the evidence from\nthe experts, is in the semen recovered from the victim\u2019s\nvagina\u201d). But I take the plurality\u2019s point that when read\n\u201c[i]n context\u201d the judge\u2019s statements might be \u201cbest under-\nstood\u201d as meaning something other than what they appear\nto say. See ante, at 20, n. 6. Still, that point suggests only\nthat the admission of Lambatos\u2019s statement was harm-\nless\u2014that the judge managed to put it out of mind. After\nall, whether a factfinder is confused by an error is a sepa-\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

So the\nplurality\u2019s argument does not answer the only question\nthis case presents: whether a constitutional violation\nhappened when Lambatos recited the Cellmark report\u2019s\nfindings.3\n   At bottom, the plurality\u2019s not-for-the-truth rationale is a\nsimple abdication to state-law labels. Although the utility\nof the Cellmark statement that Lambatos repeated logi-\ncally depended on its truth, the plurality thinks this case\ndecided by an Illinois rule holding that the facts underly-\ning an expert\u2019s opinion are not admitted for that purpose.\nSee ante, at 14\u201318; People v. Pasch, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/ill/brKb/people-v-pasch/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175\u2013\n177, 604 N.

And needless to say (or perhaps not), the Confron-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The plurality asserts (without citation) that I am \u201creach[ing] the\n\ntruly remarkable conclusion that the wording of Lambatos\u2019 testimony\nconfused the trial judge,\u201d ante, at 19, and then spends three pages\nexplaining why that conclusion is wrong, see ante, at 19\u201321. But the\nplurality is responding to an argument of its own imagining, because I\nreach no such conclusion. As I just stated, the trial judge might well\nhave ignored Lambatos\u2019s statement about the Cellmark report and\nrelied on other evidence to conclude that \u201cthe Cellmark profile was\nderived from the sample taken from the victim,\u201d ante, at 19. All I am\nsaying is that the admission of that statement violated the Confronta-\ntion Clause even if the judge ultimately put it aside, because it came\ninto evidence for nothing other than its truth. See supra, at 9\u201312.\n   Similarly, the plurality claims (still without citation) that I think the\nother evidence about the Cellmark report insufficient, see ante, at 21.\nBut once again, the plurality must be reading someone else\u2019s opinion. I\nexpress no view on sufficiency of the evidence because it is irrelevant to\nthe Confrontation Clause issue we took this case to decide. It is the\nplurality that wrongly links the two, spending another five pages\ntrumpeting the strength of the Cellmark report, see ante, at 22\u201324, 32\u2013\n33. But the plurality cannot properly decide whether a Confrontation\nClause violation occurred at Williams\u2019s trial by determining that\nWilliams was guilty. The American criminal justice system works the\nopposite way: determining guilt by holding trials in accord with consti-\ntutional requirements.\n16                  WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ntation Clause is a constitutional rule like any other. As\nJUSTICE THOMAS observes, even before Crawford, we did\nnot allow the Clause\u2019s scope to be \u201cdictated by state or\nfederal evidentiary rules.\u201d See ante, at 2. Indeed, in\nStreet, we independently reviewed whether an out-of-court\nstatement was introduced for its truth\u2014the very question\nat issue in this case. See 471 U. S., at 413\u2013416. And in\nCrawford, we still more firmly disconnected the Confron-\ntation Clause inquiry from state evidence law, by overrul-\ning an approach that looked in part to whether an out-\nof-court statement fell within a \u201c \u2018firmly rooted hearsay\nexception.\u2019 \u201d 541 U. S., at 60 (quoting Roberts, 448 U. S., at\n66). That decision made clear that the Confrontation\nClause\u2019s protections are not coterminous with rules of\nevidence. So the plurality\u2019s state-law-first approach would\nbe an about-face.\n  Still worse, that approach would allow prosecutors to do\nthrough subterfuge and indirection what we previously\nhave held the Confrontation Clause prohibits. Imagine\nfor a moment a poorly trained, incompetent, or dishonest\nlaboratory analyst. (The analyst in Bullcoming, placed on\nunpaid leave for unknown reasons, might qualify.) Under\nour precedents, the prosecutor cannot avoid exposing that\nanalyst to cross-examination simply by introducing his\nreport. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 311. Nor can the\nprosecutor escape that fate by offering the results through\nthe testimony of another analyst from the laboratory. See\nBullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). But under\nthe plurality\u2019s approach, the prosecutor could choose the\nanalyst-witness of his dreams (as the judge here said, \u201cthe\nbest DNA witness I have ever heard\u201d), offer her as an\nexpert (she knows nothing about the test, but boasts im-\npressive degrees), and have her provide testimony identi-\ncal to the best the actual tester might have given (\u201cthe\nDNA extracted from the vaginal swabs matched Sandy\nWilliams\u2019s\u201d)\u2014all so long as a state evidence rule says that\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

(And this tactic would\nnot be confined to cases involving scientific evidence. As\nJUSTICE THOMAS points out, the prosecutor could similarly\nsubstitute experts for all kinds of people making out-of-\ncourt statements. See ante, at 7.) The plurality thus\nwould countenance the Constitution\u2019s circumvention. If\nthe Confrontation Clause prevents the State from getting\nits evidence in through the front door, then the State could\nsneak it in through the back. What a neat trick\u2014but\nreally, what a way to run a criminal justice system. No\nwonder five Justices reject it.\n                              III\n   The plurality also argues, as a \u201csecond, independent\nbasis\u201d for its decision, that the Cellmark report falls out-\nside the Confrontation Clause\u2019s ambit because it is nontes-\ntimonial. Ante, at 3. The plurality tries out a number of\nsupporting theories, but all in vain: Each one either con-\nflicts with this Court\u2019s precedents or misconstrues this\ncase\u2019s facts. JUSTICE THOMAS rejects the plurality\u2019s views\nfor similar reasons as I do, thus bringing to five the num-\nber of Justices who repudiate the plurality\u2019s understand-\ning of what statements count as testimonial. See ante, at\n1, 12\u201315. JUSTICE THOMAS, however, offers a rationale\nof his own for deciding that the Cellmark report is non-\ntestimonial. I think his essay works no better. When\nall is said and done, the Cellmark report is a testimonial\nstatement.\n                               A\n   According to the plurality, we should declare the\nCellmark report nontestimonial because \u201cthe use at trial\nof a DNA report prepared by a modern, accredited labora-\ntory \u2018bears little if any resemblance to the historical prac-\ntices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 33 (quoting Michigan v.

See ante, at 29, n. 13 (\u201cExpe-\nrience might yet show that the holdings in [Bullcoming\nand other post-Crawford] cases should be reconsidered\u201d).\nSo the plurality must explain: What could support a dis-\ntinction between the laboratory analysis there and the\nDNA test in this case?4\n  As its first stab, the plurality states that the Cellmark\nreport was \u201cnot prepared for the primary purpose of accus-\ning a targeted individual.\u201d Ante, at 31. Where that test\ncomes from is anyone\u2019s guess. JUSTICE THOMAS rightly\nshows that it derives neither from the text nor from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 JUSTICE BREYER does not attempt to distinguish our precedents,\n\nopting simply to adhere to \u201cthe dissenting view set forth in Melendez-\nDiaz and Bullcoming.\u201d See ante, at 8 (concurring opinion). He princi-\npally worries that under those cases, a State will have to call to the\nwitness stand \u201c[s]ix to twelve or more technicians\u201d who have worked on\na report. See ante, at 5; see also ante, at 3, 16\u201318. But none of our\ncases\u2014including this one\u2014has presented the question of how many\nanalysts must testify about a given report. (That may suggest that in\nmost cases a lead analyst is readily identifiable.) The problem in the\ncases\u2014again, including this one\u2014is that no analyst came forward to\ntestify. In the event that some future case presents the multiple-\ntechnician issue, the Court can focus on \u201cthe broader \u2018limits\u2019 question\u201d\nthat troubles JUSTICE BREYER, ante, at 7. But the mere existence of\nthat question is no reason to wrongly decide the case before us\u2014which,\nit bears repeating, involved the testimony of not twelve or six or three\nor one, but zero Cellmark analysts.\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     19\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nhistory of the Confrontation Clause. See ante, at 14\u201315\n(opinion concurring in judgment). And it has no basis in\nour precedents. We have previously asked whether a\nstatement was made for the primary purpose of establish-\ning \u201cpast events potentially relevant to later criminal\nprosecution\u201d\u2014in other words, for the purpose of providing\nevidence. Davis, 547 U. S., at 822; see also Bullcoming,\n564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14); Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___,\n___ (slip op., at 14, 29); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U. S., at 310\u2013\n311; Crawford, 541 U. S., at 51\u201352. None of our cases has\never suggested that, in addition, the statement must be\nmeant to accuse a previously identified individual; indeed,\nin Melendez-Diaz, we rejected a related argument that\nlaboratory \u201canalysts are not subject to confrontation be-\ncause they are not \u2018accusatory\u2019 witnesses.\u201d 557 U. S., at\n313.\n   Nor does the plurality give any good reason for adopting\nan \u201caccusation\u201d test. The plurality apparently agrees with\nJUSTICE BREYER that prior to a suspect\u2019s identification,\nit will be \u201cunlikely that a particular researcher has a\ndefendant-related motive to behave dishonestly.\u201d Ante, at 12\n(BREYER, J., concurring); see ante, at 31\u201332 (plurality\nopinion). But surely the typical problem with laboratory\nanalyses\u2014and the typical focus of cross-examination\u2014has\nto do with careless or incompetent work, rather than with\npersonal vendettas. And as to that predominant concern,\nit makes not a whit of difference whether, at the time of\nthe laboratory test, the police already have a suspect.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Neither can the plurality gain any purchase from the idea that a\nDNA profile is not \u201cinherently inculpatory\u201d because it \u201ctends to excul-\npate all but one of the more than 7 billion people in the world today.\u201d\nAnte, at 3; see ante, at 32. All evidence shares this feature: the more\ninculpatory it is of a single person, the more exculpatory it is of the rest\nof the world. The one is but the flipside of the other. But no one has\never before suggested that this logical corollary provides a reason to\nignore the Constitution\u2019s efforts to ensure the reliability of evidence.\n20                   WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   The plurality next attempts to invoke our precedents\nholding statements nontestimonial when made \u201cto respond\nto an \u2018ongoing emergency,\u2019 \u201d rather than to create evidence\nfor trial, Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); here, the\nplurality insists, the Cellmark report\u2019s purpose was \u201cto\ncatch a dangerous rapist who was still at large.\u201d Ante, at\n31. But that is to stretch both our \u201congoing emergency\u201d\ntest and the facts of this case beyond all recognition. We\nhave previously invoked that test to allow statements by a\nwoman who was being assaulted and a man who had just\nbeen shot. In doing so, we stressed the \u201cinformal [and]\nharried\u201d nature of the statements, Bryant, 562 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 31)\u2014that they were made as, or \u201cminutes\u201d\nafter, id., at ___ (slip op., at 28), the events they described\n\u201cactually happen[ed],\u201d Davis, 547 U. S., at 827 (emphasis\ndeleted), by \u201cfrantic\u201d victims of criminal attacks, ibid.,\nto officers trying to figure out \u201cwhat had . . . occurred\u201d and\nwhat threats remained, Bryant, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 30) (internal quotation marks omitted). On their face,\nthe decisions have nothing to say about laboratory ana-\nlysts conducting routine tests far away from a crime scene.\nAnd this case presents a peculiarly inapt set of facts\nfor extending those precedents. Lambatos testified at trial\nthat \u201call reports in this case were prepared for this crimi-\nnal investigation . . . [a]nd for the purpose of the eventual\nlitigation,\u201d App. 82\u2014in other words, for the purpose of\nproducing evidence, not enabling emergency responders.\nAnd that testimony fits the relevant timeline. The police\ndid not send the swabs to Cellmark until November\n2008\u2014nine months after L. J.\u2019s rape\u2014and did not receive\nthe results for another four months. See id., at 30\u201334, 51\u2013\n52, 54. That is hardly the typical emergency response.\n   Finally, the plurality offers a host of reasons for why\nreports like this one are reliable: \u201c[T]here [i]s no prospect\nof fabrication,\u201d ante, at 31 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); multiple technicians may \u201cwork on each DNA\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   21\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nprofile,\u201d ante, at 32; and \u201cdefects in a DNA profile may\noften be detected from the profile itself,\u201d ibid. See also\nante, at 10\u201314 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But once again:\nBeen there, done that. In Melendez-Diaz, this Court re-\njected identical arguments, noting extensive documenta-\ntion of \u201c[s]erious deficiencies . . . in the forensic evidence\nused in criminal trials.\u201d 557 U. S., at 319; see supra, at 4\u2013\n5; see also Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 4,\nn. 1) (citing similar errors in laboratory analysis); Brief for\nPublic Defender Service for the District of Columbia et al.\nas Amici Curiae 13 (discussing \u201c[s]ystemic problems,\u201d such\nas sample contamination, sample switching, mislabeling,\nand fraud, at \u201c \u2018flagship\u2019 DNA labs\u201d). Scientific testing is\n\u201ctechnical,\u201d to be sure, ante, at 1 (opinion of BREYER, J.);\nbut it is only as reliable as the people who perform it.\nThat is why a defendant may wish to ask the analyst a\nvariety of questions: How much experience do you have?\nHave you ever made mistakes in the past? Did you test\nthe right sample? Use the right procedures? Contaminate\nthe sample in any way? Indeed, as scientific evidence\nplays a larger and larger role in criminal prosecutions,\nthose inquiries will often be the most important in the\ncase.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Both  the plurality and JUSTICE BREYER warn that if we require ana-\nlysts to testify, we will encourage prosecutors to forgo DNA evidence in\nfavor of less reliable eyewitness testimony and so \u201cincrease the risk of\nconvicting the innocent.\u201d Ante, at 13 (BREYER, J., concurring); see ante,\nat 3\u20134 (plurality opinion). Neither opinion provides any evidence, even\nby way of anecdote, for that view, and I doubt any exists. DNA evi-\ndence is usually the prosecutor\u2019s most powerful weapon, and a prosecu-\ntor is unlikely to relinquish it just because he must bring the right\nanalyst to the stand. Consider what Lambatos told the factfinder here:\nThe DNA in L. J.\u2019s vaginal swabs matched Williams\u2019s DNA and would\nmatch only \u201c1 in 8.7 quadrillion black, 1 in 390 quadrillion white, or\n1 in 109 quadrillion Hispanic unrelated individuals.\u201d App. 56\u201357. No\neyewitness testimony could replace that evidence. I note as well that\nthe Innocence Network\u2014a group particularly knowledgeable about the\n22                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   And Melendez-Diaz made yet a more fundamental point\nin response to claims of the \u00fcber alles reliability of scien-\ntific evidence: It is not up to us to decide, ex ante, what\nevidence is trustworthy and what is not. See 557 U. S., at\n317\u2013318; see also Bullcoming, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n11). That is because the Confrontation Clause prescribes\nits own \u201cprocedure for determining the reliability of testi-\nmony in criminal trials.\u201d Crawford, 541 U. S., at 67. That\nprocedure is cross-examination. And \u201c[d]ispensing with\n[it] because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dis-\npensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously\nguilty.\u201d Id., at 62.\n   So the plurality\u2019s second basis for denying Williams\u2019s\nright of confrontation also fails. The plurality can find no\nreason consistent with our precedents for treating the\nCellmark report as nontestimonial. That is because the\nreport is, in every conceivable respect, a statement meant\nto serve as evidence in a potential criminal trial. And that\nsimple fact should be sufficient to resolve the question.\n                             B\n   JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s unique method of defining testimo-\nnial statements fares no better. On his view, the Con-\nfrontation Clause \u201cregulates only the use of statements\nbearing \u2018indicia of solemnity.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8 (quoting Davis,\n547 U. S., at 836\u2013837). And Cellmark\u2019s report, he con-\ncludes, does not qualify because it is \u201cneither a sworn nor a\ncertified declaration of fact.\u201d Ante, at 9. But JUSTICE\nTHOMAS\u2019s approach grants constitutional significance to\nminutia, in a way that can only undermine the Confronta-\ntion Clause\u2019s protections.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nkinds of evidence that produce erroneous convictions\u2014disagrees with\nthe plurality\u2019s and JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s view. It argues here that \u201c[c]on-\nfrontation of the analyst . . . is essential to permit proper adversarial\ntesting\u201d and so to decrease the risk of convicting the innocent. Brief\nfor the Innocence Network as Amicus Curiae 3, 7.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           23\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   To see the point, start with precedent, because the\nCourt rejected this same kind of argument, as applied to\nthis same kind of document, at around this same time\njust last year. In Bullcoming, the State asserted that\nthe forensic report at issue was nontestimonial because\u2014\nunlike the report in Melendez-Diaz\u2014it was not sworn\nbefore a notary public. We responded that applying the\nConfrontation Clause only to a sworn forensic report\n\u201cwould make the right to confrontation easily erasable\u201d\u2014\nnext time, the laboratory could file the selfsame report\nwithout the oath. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). We\nthen held, as noted earlier, that \u201c[i]n all material re-\nspects,\u201d the forensic report in Bullcoming matched the one\nin Melendez-Diaz. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15); see\nsupra, at 5. First, a law enforcement officer provided\nevidence to a state laboratory assisting in police investiga-\ntions. See 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Second, the\nanalyst tested the evidence and \u201cprepared a certificate\nconcerning the result[s].\u201d Ibid. Third, the certificate was\n\u201cformalized in a signed document . . . headed a \u2018report.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (some internal quotation marks omitted). That was\nenough.\n   Now compare that checklist of \u201cmaterial\u201d features to the\nreport in this case. The only differences are that Cellmark\nis a private laboratory under contract with the State\n(which no one thinks relevant), and that the report is not\nlabeled a \u201ccertificate.\u201d That amounts to (maybe) a nickel\u2019s\nworth of difference: The similarities in form, function, and\npurpose dwarf the distinctions. See supra, at 5\u20136. Each\nreport is an official and signed record of laboratory test\nresults, meant to establish a certain set of facts in legal\nproceedings. Neither looks any more \u201cformal\u201d than the\nother; neither is any more formal than the other. See ibid.\nThe variances are no more (probably less) than would be\nfound if you compared different law schools\u2019 transcripts\nor different companies\u2019 cash flow statements or different\n24                     WILLIAMS v. ILLINOIS\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nStates\u2019 birth certificates. The difference in labeling\u2014a\n\u201ccertificate\u201d in one case, a \u201creport of laboratory examina-\ntion\u201d in the other\u2014is not of constitutional dimension.\n   Indeed, JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019s approach, if accepted, would\nturn the Confrontation Clause into a constitutional gee-\ngaw\u2014nice for show, but of little value. The prosecution\ncould avoid its demands by using the right kind of forms\nwith the right kind of language. (It would not take long to\ndevise the magic words and rules\u2014principally, never call\nanything a \u201ccertificate.\u201d)7 And still worse: The new con-\nventions, precisely by making out-of-court statements less\n\u201csolem[n],\u201d ante, at 1, would also make them less relia-\nble\u2014and so turn the Confrontation Clause upside down.\nSee Crawford, 541 U. S., at 52\u201353, n. 3 (\u201cWe find it im-\nplausible that a provision which concededly condemned\ntrial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn\nex parte affidavit perfectly OK\u201d). It is not surprising that\nno other Member of the Court has adopted this position.\nTo do so, as JUSTICE THOMAS rightly says of the plurality\u2019s\ndecision, would be to \u201cdiminis[h] the Confrontation\nClause\u2019s protection\u201d in \u201cthe very cases in which the ac-\ncused should \u2018enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 16.\n                             IV\n   Before today\u2019s decision, a prosecutor wishing to admit\nthe results of forensic testing had to produce the techni-\ncian responsible for the analysis. That was the result of\nnot one, but two decisions this Court issued in the last\nthree years. But that clear rule is clear no longer. The\nfive Justices who control the outcome of today\u2019s case agree\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 JUSTICE THOMAS asserts there is no need to worry, because \u201cthe\n\nConfrontation Clause reaches bad-faith attempts to evade the formal-\nized process.\u201d Ante, at 10; see ante, at 9, n. 5. I hope he is right. But\nJUSTICE THOMAS provides scant guidance on how to conduct this novel\ninquiry into motive.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          25\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\non very little. Among them, though, they can boast of two\naccomplishments. First, they have approved the introduc-\ntion of testimony at Williams\u2019s trial that the Confrontation\nClause, rightly understood, clearly prohibits. Second, they\nhave left significant confusion in their wake. What\ncomes out of four Justices\u2019 desire to limit Melendez-Diaz\nand Bullcoming in whatever way possible, combined with\none Justice\u2019s one-justice view of those holdings, is\u2014to be\nfrank\u2014who knows what. Those decisions apparently no\nlonger mean all that they say. Yet no one can tell in what\nway or to what extent they are altered because no pro-\nposed limitation commands the support of a majority.\n   The better course in this case would have been simply to\nfollow Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Precedent-based\ndecisionmaking provides guidance to lower court judges\nand predictability to litigating parties. Today\u2019s plurality\nand concurring opinions, and the uncertainty they sow,\nbring into relief that judicial method\u2019s virtues. I would\ndecide this case consistently with, and for the reasons\nstated by, Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. And until a\nmajority of this Court reverses or confines those decisions,\nI would understand them as continuing to govern, in every\nparticular, the admission of forensic evidence.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
