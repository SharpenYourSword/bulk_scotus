UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11\u20135683. Argued April 17, 2012\u2014Decided June 21, 2012*\nUnder the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug Act), the 5- and 10-year\n mandatory minimum prison terms for federal drug crimes reflected a\n 100-to-1 disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder\n cocaine needed to trigger the minimums. Thus, the 5-year minimum\n was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute\n 5 grams of crack cocaine but 500 grams of powder, and the 10-year\n minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to\n distribute 50 grams of crack but 5,000 grams of powder. The United\n States Sentencing Commission\u2014which is charged under the Sentenc-\n ing Reform Act of 1984 with writing the Federal Sentencing Guide-\n lines\u2014incorporated the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 100-to-1 disparity into the\n Guidelines because it believed that doing so was the best way to keep\n similar drug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying\n the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s basic proportionality objective. The Fair\n Sentencing Act, which took effect on August 3, 2010, reduced the dis-\n parity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to\n many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to\n trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for\n the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the pow-\n der cocaine amounts intact. It also directed the Sentencing Commis-\n sion to make conforming amendments to the Guidelines \u201cas soon as\n practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s\n effective date). The new amendments became effective on November\n 1, 2010.\n    In No. 11\u22125721, petitioner Hill unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u20135721, Hill v. United States, also on certiorari\nto the same court.\n2                     DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    2007, but was not sentenced until December 2010. Sentencing him to\n    the 10-year minimum mandated by the 1986 Drug Act, the District\n    Judge ruled that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s 5-year minimum for sell-\n    ing that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were\n    committed before the Act\u2019s effective date. In No. 11\u22125683, petitioner\n    Dorsey unlawfully sold 5.5 grams of crack in 2008. In September\n    2010, the District Judge sentenced him to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 10-\n    year minimum, finding that it applied because Dorsey had a prior\n    drug conviction and declining to apply the Fair Sentencing Act, under\n    which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount\n    less than 28 grams, because Dorsey\u2019s offense predated that Act\u2019s ef-\n    fective date. The Seventh Circuit affirmed in both cases.\nHeld: The Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new, lower mandatory minimums ap-\n ply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders. Pp. 10\u221220.\n    (a) Language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.\n The general federal saving statute (1871 Act) provides that a new\n criminal statute that \u201crepeal[s]\u201d an older criminal statute shall not\n change the penalties \u201cincurred\u201d under that older statute \u201cunless the\n repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109. The word\n \u201crepeal\u201d applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties\n that the older statute set forth, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653,\n 659\u2212664, and penalties are \u201cincurred\u201d under the older statute when\n an offender becomes subject to them, i.e., commits the underlying\n conduct that makes the offender liable, see United States v.\n Reisinger, 128 U. S. 398, 401. In contrast, the Sentencing Reform Act\n says that, regardless of when the offender\u2019s conduct occurs, the appli-\n cable sentencing guidelines are the ones \u201cin effect on the date the de-\n fendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\n    Six considerations, taken together, show that Congress intended\n the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to apply to offenders\n who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced af-\n ter that date. First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to ap-\n ply a new Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders without\n expressly saying so in the new Act. The 1871 Act creates what is in\n effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute\n \u201ccannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested, ei-\n ther expressly or by necessary implication, in a subsequent enact-\n ment.\u201d Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S. 452, 465.\n Hence, this Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting forth an im-\n portant background principle of interpretation that requires courts,\n before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties\n to a set of pre-Act offenders, to assure themselves by the \u201cplain im-\n port\u201d or \u201cfair implication\u201d of the new statute that ordinary interpre-\n tive considerations point clearly in that direction. Second, the Sen-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntencing Reform Act sets forth a special and different background\nprinciple in \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which applies unless ex post facto con-\ncerns are present. Thus, new, lower Guidelines amendments apply to\noffenders who committed an offense before the adoption of the\namendments but are sentenced thereafter. Third, language in the\nFair Sentencing Act implies that Congress intended to follow the\nSentencing Reform Act\u2019s special background principle here. Section 8\nof the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission to promulgate\nconforming amendments to the Guidelines that \u201cachieve consistency\nwith other guideline provisions and applicable law.\u201d Read most nat-\nurally, \u201capplicable law\u201d refers to the law as changed by the Fair Sen-\ntencing Act, including the provision reducing the crack mandatory\nminimums. And consistency with \u201cother guideline provisions\u201d and\nwith prior Commission practice would require application of the new\nGuidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense be-\nfore the new amendments\u2019 effective date but were sentenced thereaf-\nter. Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old mandatory minimums\nto the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3 offenders would cre-\nate sentencing disparities of a kind that Congress enacted the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent. Fifth,\nnot to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do more than preserve a\ndisproportionate status quo; it would make matters worse by creating\nnew anomalies\u2015new sets of disproportionate sentences\u2015not previous-\nly present. That is because sentencing courts must apply the new\nGuidelines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new mini-\nmums) to pre-Act offenders, and the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old minimums\nwould trump those new Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not\nfor all of them. Application of the 1986 Drug Act minimums to pre-\nAct offenders sentenced after the new Guidelines take effect would\ntherefore produce a set of sentences at odds with Congress\u2019 basic ef-\nforts to create more uniform, more proportionate sentences. Sixth,\nthis Court has found no strong countervailing considerations that\nwould make a critical difference. Pp. 10\u221219.\n   (b) The new Act\u2019s lower minimums also apply to those who commit-\nted an offense prior to August 3 and were sentenced between that\ndate and November 1, 2010, the effective date of the new Guidelines.\nThe Act simply instructs the Commission to promulgate new Guide-\nlines \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the Act\ntook effect), and thus as far as Congress was concerned, the Commis-\nsion might have promulgated those Guidelines to be effective as early\nas August 3. In any event, courts, treating the Guidelines as advi-\nsory, possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new mini-\nmums. Finally, applying the new minimums to all who are sentenced\nafter August 3 makes it possible to foresee a reasonably smooth tran-\n4                    DORSEY v.

Until 2010, the relevant statute imposed upon an\noffender who dealt in powder cocaine the same sentence it\nimposed upon an offender who dealt in one one-hundredth\nthat amount of crack cocaine. It imposed, for example, the\nsame 5-year minimum term upon (1) an offender convicted\nof possessing with intent to distribute 500 grams of pow-\nder cocaine as upon (2) an offender convicted of possessing\nwith intent to distribute 5 grams of crack.\n  In 2010, Congress enacted a new statute reducing the\ncrack-to-powder cocaine disparity from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1.\nFair Sentencing Act, 124 Stat. 2372. The new statute took\n2               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffect on August 3, 2010. The question here is whether\nthe Act\u2019s more lenient penalty provisions apply to offend-\ners who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3,\n2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3. We\nhold that the new, more lenient mandatory minimum\nprovisions do apply to those pre-Act offenders.\n                               I\n   The underlying question before us is one of congres-\nsional intent as revealed in the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s lan-\nguage, structure, and basic objectives. Did Congress\nintend the Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to apply to pre-Act\noffenders sentenced after the Act took effect?\n   We recognize that, because of important background\nprinciples of interpretation, we must assume that Con-\ngress did not intend those penalties to apply unless it\nclearly indicated to the contrary. See infra, at 10\u201313. But\nwe find that clear indication here. We rest our conclu-\nsion primarily upon the fact that a contrary determination\nwould seriously undermine basic Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines objectives such as uniformity and proportional-\nity in sentencing. Indeed, seen from that perspective, a\ncontrary determination would (in respect to relevant\ngroups of drug offenders) produce sentences less uniform\nand more disproportionate than if Congress had not en-\nacted the Fair Sentencing Act at all. See infra, at 14\u201318.\n   Because our conclusion rests upon an analysis of the\nGuidelines-based sentencing system Congress has estab-\nlished, we describe that system at the outset and include\nan explanation of how the Guidelines interact with federal\nstatutes setting forth specific terms of imprisonment.\n                           A\n  The Guidelines originate in the Sentencing Reform Act\nof 1984, 98 Stat. 1987. That statute created a federal\nSentencing Commission instructed to write guidelines that\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudges would use to determine sentences imposed upon\noffenders convicted of committing federal crimes. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991, 994. Congress thereby sought to increase\ntransparency, uniformity, and proportionality in sentenc-\ning. United States Sentencing Commission (USSC or\nCommission), Guidelines Manual \u00a71A1.3, p. 2 (Nov. 2011)\n(USSG); see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991(b)(1), 994(f).\n   The Sentencing Reform Act directed the Commission to\ncreate in the Guidelines categories of offense behavior\n(e.g., \u201c \u2018bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken\u2019 \u201d)\nand offender characteristics (e.g., \u201cone prior conviction\u201d).\nUSSG \u00a71A1.2, at 1; see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7994(a)\u2013(e). A sen-\ntencing judge determines a Guidelines range by (1) finding\nthe applicable offense level and offender category and then\n(2) consulting a table that lists proportionate sentenc-\ning ranges (e.g., 18 to 24 months of imprisonment) at the\nintersections of rows (marking offense levels) and columns\n(marking offender categories). USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sen-\ntencing Table, \u00a7\u00a75E1.2, 7B1.4; see also \u00a71A1.4(h), at 11.\nThe Guidelines, after telling the judge how to determine the\napplicable offense level and offender category, instruct the\njudge to apply the intersection\u2019s range in an ordinary case,\nbut they leave the judge free to depart from that range in\nan unusual case. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b); USSG \u00a7\u00a71A1.2,\nat 1\u20132, 1A1.4(b), at 6\u20137. This Court has held that the\nGuidelines are now advisory. United States v. Booker, 543\nU. S. 220, 245, 264 (2005); see Kimbrough v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 85, 91 (2007).\n   The Guidelines determine most drug-crime offense lev-\nels in a special way. They set forth a Drug Quantity\nTable (or Table) that lists amounts of various drugs and\nassociates different amounts with different \u201cBase Offense\nLevels\u201d (to which a judge may add or subtract levels de-\npending upon the \u201cspecific\u201d characteristics of the offender\u2019s\nbehavior). See USSG \u00a72D1.1. The Table, for example,\nassociates 400 to 499 grams of powder cocaine with a base\n4                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffense level of 24, a level that would mean for a first-time\noffender a prison term of 51 to 63 months. \u00a72D1.1(c).\n   In 1986, Congress enacted a more specific, drug-related\nsentencing statute, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug\nAct), 100 Stat. 3207. That statute sets forth mandatory\nminimum penalties of 5 and 10 years applicable to a drug\noffender depending primarily upon the kind and amount of\ndrugs involved in the offense. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)\n(A)\u2013(C) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). The minimum applicable\nto an offender convicted of possessing with intent to dis-\ntribute 500 grams or more of powder cocaine is 5 years,\nand for 5,000 grams or more of powder the minimum is\n10 years. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B)(ii). The 1986 Drug Act,\nhowever, treated crack cocaine crimes as far more serious.\nIt applied its 5-year minimum to an offender convicted of\npossessing with intent to distribute only 5 grams of crack\n(as compared to 500 grams of powder) and its 10-year\nminimum to one convicted of possessing with intent to\ndistribute only 50 grams of crack (as compared to 5,000\ngrams of powder), thus producing a 100-to-1 crack-to-\npowder ratio. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii) (2006 ed.).\n   The 1986 Drug Act, like other federal sentencing stat-\nutes, interacts with the Guidelines in an important way.\nLike other sentencing statutes, it trumps the Guidelines.\nThus, ordinarily no matter what the Guidelines provide, a\njudge cannot sentence an offender to a sentence beyond\nthe maximum contained in the federal statute setting\nforth the crime of conviction. Similarly, ordinarily no\nmatter what range the Guidelines set forth, a sentencing\njudge must sentence an offender to at least the minimum\nprison term set forth in a statutory mandatory minimum.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7994(a), (b)(1); USSG \u00a75G1.1; Neal v.\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 284, 289\u2013290, 295 (1996).\n   Not surprisingly, the Sentencing Commission incorpo-\nrated the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s mandatory minimums into the\nfirst version of the Guidelines themselves. Kimbrough,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 96\u201397. It did so by setting a base offense level\nfor a first-time drug offender that corresponded to the\nlowest Guidelines range above the applicable mandatory\nminimum. USSC, Report to the Congress: Mandatory\nMinimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice Sys-\ntem 53\u201354 (Oct. 2011) (2011 Report). Thus, the first\nGuidelines Drug Quantity Table associated 500 grams\nof powder cocaine with an offense level of 26, which for a\nfirst-time offender meant a sentencing range of 63 to 78\nmonths (just above the 5-year minimum), and it associated\n5,000 grams of powder cocaine with an offense level of 32,\nwhich for a first-time offender meant a sentencing range\nof 121 to 151 months (just above the 10-year minimum).\nUSSG \u00a72D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Further reflecting the 1986\nDrug Act\u2019s 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table asso-\nciated an offense level of 26 with 5 grams of crack and an\noffense level of 32 with 50 grams of crack. Ibid.\n   In addition, the Drug Quantity Table set offense levels\nfor small drug amounts that did not trigger the 1986 Drug\nAct\u2019s mandatory minimums so that the resulting Guide-\nlines sentences would remain proportionate to the sen-\ntences for amounts that did trigger these minimums. 2011\nReport 54. Thus, the Table associated 400 grams of pow-\nder cocaine (an amount that fell just below the amount\ntriggering the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 5-year minimum) with an\noffense level of 24, which for a first-time offender meant a\nsentencing range of 51 to 63 months (the range just below\nthe 5-year minimum). USSG \u00a72D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Follow-\ning the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table associated\nfour grams of crack (an amount that also fell just below\nthe amount triggering the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 5-year mini-\nmum) with an offense level of 24. Ibid.\n   The Commission did this not because it necessarily\nthought that those levels were most in keeping with past\nsentencing practice or would independently have reflected\na fair set of sentences, but rather because the Commission\n6                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieved that doing so was the best way to keep similar\ndrug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying\nthe Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s basic \u201cproportionality\u201d objec-\ntive. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 97; USSG \u00a71A1.3 (Nov.\n2011); 2011 Report 53\u201354, 349, and n. 845. For this rea-\nson, the Commission derived the Drug Quantity Table\u2019s\nentire set of crack and powder cocaine offense levels by\nusing the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s two (5- and 10-year) minimum\namounts as reference points and then extrapolating from\nthose two amounts upward and downward to set propor-\ntional offense levels for other drug amounts. Ibid.\n                              B\n   During the next two decades, the Commission and\nothers in the law enforcement community strongly criti-\ncized Congress\u2019 decision to set the crack-to-powder manda-\ntory minimum ratio at 100-to-1. The Commission issued\nfour separate reports telling Congress that the ratio was\ntoo high and unjustified because, for example, research\nshowed the relative harm between crack and powder\ncocaine less severe than 100-to-1, because sentences em-\nbodying that ratio could not achieve the Sentencing Re-\nform Act\u2019s \u201cuniformity\u201d goal of treating like offenders\nalike, because they could not achieve the \u201cproportionality\u201d\ngoal of treating different offenders (e.g., major drug traf-\nfickers and low-level dealers) differently, and because the\npublic had come to understand sentences embodying the\n100-to-1 ratio as reflecting unjustified race-based differ-\nences. Kimbrough, supra, at 97\u201398; see, e.g., USSC,\nSpecial Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sen-\ntencing Policy 197\u2013198 (Feb. 1995) (1995 Report); USSC,\nSpecial Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentenc-\ning Policy 8 (Apr. 1997) (1997 Report); USSC, Report to\nCongress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 91, 103\n(May 2002) (2002 Report); USSC, Report to Congress:\nCocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007) (2007\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReport). The Commission also asked Congress for new\nlegislation embodying a lower crack-to-powder ratio. 1995\nReport 198\u2013200; 1997 Report 9\u201310; 2002 Report 103\u2013\n107; 2007 Report 6\u20139. And the Commission recommended\nthat the legislation \u201cinclude\u201d an \u201cemergency amendment\u201d\nallowing \u201cthe Commission to incorporate the statutory\nchanges\u201d in the Guidelines while \u201cminimiz[ing] the lag\nbetween any statutory and guideline modifications for\ncocaine offenders.\u201d Id., at 9.\n   In 2010, Congress accepted the Commission\u2019s recom-\nmendations, see 2002 Report 104; 2007 Report 8\u20139, and\nn. 26, and enacted the Fair Sentencing Act into law. The\nAct increased the drug amounts triggering mandatory\nminimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to\n28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from 50\ngrams to 280 grams in respect to the 10-year minimum\n(while leaving powder at 500 grams and 5,000 grams\nrespectively). \u00a72(a), 124 Stat. 2372. The change had the\neffect of lowering the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18-\nto-1. (The Act also eliminated the 5-year mandatory\nminimum for simple possession of crack. \u00a73, 124 Stat.\n2372.)\n   Further, the Fair Sentencing Act instructed the Com-\nmission to \u201cmake such conforming amendments to the\nFederal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deter-\nmines necessary to achieve consistency with other guide-\nline provisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78(2), id., at 2374.\nAnd it directed the Commission to \u201cpromulgate the guide-\nlines, policy statements, or amendments provided for in\nthis Act as soon as practicable, and in any event not later\nthan 90 days\u201d after the new Act took effect. \u00a78(1), ibid.\n   The Fair Sentencing Act took effect on August 3,\n2010. The Commission promulgated conforming emergency\nGuidelines amendments that became effective on Novem-\nber 1, 2010. 75 Fed. Reg. 66188 (2010). A permanent\nversion of those Guidelines amendments took effect on\n8                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNovember 1, 2011. See 76 id., at 24960 (2011).\n                               C\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the relevant\nfacts of the cases before us. Corey Hill, one of the peti-\ntioners, unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in March 2007,\nbefore the Fair Sentencing Act became law. App. in No.\n11\u20135721, pp. 6, 83 (hereinafter Hill App.). Under the 1986\nDrug Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of crack was\nsubject to a 10-year mandatory minimum. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006 ed.). Hill was not sentenced, how-\never, until December 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act\nbecame law and after the new Guidelines amendments\nhad become effective. Hill App. 83\u201394. Under the Fair\nSentencing Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of\ncrack was subject to a 5-year, not a 10-year, minimum.\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The sentencing\njudge stated that, if he thought that the Fair Sentencing\nAct applied, he would have sentenced Hill to that Act\u2019s 5-\nyear minimum. Id., at 69. But he concluded that the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s lower minimums apply only to those who\ncommitted a drug crime after August 3, 2010\u2014the Act\u2019s\neffective date. Id., at 65, 68. That is to say, he concluded\nthat the new Act\u2019s more lenient sentences did not apply\nto those who committed a crime before August 3, even if\nthey were sentenced after that date. Hence, the judge sen-\ntenced Hill to 10 years of imprisonment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 417\nFed. Appx. 560 (2011).\n   The second petitioner, Edward Dorsey (who had previ-\nously been convicted of a drug felony), unlawfully sold 5.5\ngrams of crack in August 2008, before the Fair Sentencing\nAct took effect. App. in No. 5683, pp. 9, 48\u201349, 57\u201358\n(hereinafter Dorsey App.). Under the 1986 Drug Act, an\noffender such as Dorsey with a prior drug felony who sold\n5.5 grams of crack was subject to a 10-year minimum.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed.). Dorsey was not sentenced,\nhowever, until September 2010, after the new Fair Sen-\ntencing Act took effect. Id., at 84\u201395. Under the Fair\nSentencing Act, such an offender who sold 5.5 grams of\ncrack was not subject to a mandatory minimum at all, for\n5.5 grams is less than the 28 grams that triggers the new\nAct\u2019s mandatory minimum provisions. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Dorsey asked the judge to apply the\nFair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient statutory penalties.\nId., at 54\u201355.\n  Moreover, as of Dorsey\u2019s sentencing in September 2010,\nthe unrevised Guidelines (reflecting the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s\nold minimums) were still in effect. The Commission had\nnot yet finished revising the Guidelines to reflect the\nnew, lower statutory minimums. And the basic sentencing\nstatute, the Sentencing Reform Act, provides that a judge\nshall apply the Guidelines that \u201care in effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\n  The sentencing judge, however, had the legal authority\nnot to apply the Guidelines at all (for they are advisory).\nBut he also knew that he could not ignore a minimum\nsentence contained in the applicable statute. Dorsey App.\n67\u201368. The judge noted that, even though he was sentenc-\ning Dorsey after the effective date of the Fair Sentencing\nAct, Dorsey had committed the underlying crime prior to\nthat date. Id., at 69\u201370. And he concluded that the 1986\nDrug Act\u2019s old minimums, not the new Fair Sentencing\nAct, applied in those circumstances. Ibid. He consequently\nsentenced Dorsey to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 10-year man-\ndatory minimum term. Id., at 80. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit affirmed, United States v. Fisher,\n635 F. 3d 336 (2011), and denied rehearing en banc, 646\nF. 3d 429 (2011) (per curiam); see also United States v.\nHolcomb, 657 F. 3d 445 (CA7 2011).\n  The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu-\nsions as to whether the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient\n10               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmandatory minimums apply to offenders whose unlawful\nconduct took place before, but whose sentencing took place\nafter, the date that Act took effect, namely, August 3,\n2010. Compare United States v. Douglas, 644 F. 3d 39,\n42\u201344 (CA1 2011) (Act applies), and United States v.\nDixon, 648 F. 3d 195, 203 (CA3 2011) (same), with 635\nF. 3d, at 339\u2013340 (Act does not apply), United States v.\nSidney, 648 F. 3d 904, 910 (CA8 2011) (same), and\nUnited States v. Tickles, 661 F. 3d 212, 215 (CA5 2011)\n(per curiam) (same). In light of that disagreement, we\ngranted Hill\u2019s and Dorsey\u2019s petitions for certiorari. Since\npetitioners and the Government both take the position\nthat the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new minimums do apply\nin these circumstances, we appointed as amicus curiae\nMiguel Estrada to argue the contrary position. He has ably\ndischarged his responsibilities.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  The timing issue before us is difficult in part because\nrelevant language in different statutes argues in opposite\ndirections. See Appendix A, infra. On the one hand, a\nfederal saving statute, Act of Feb. 25, 1871 (1871 Act), \u00a74,\n16 Stat. 432, phrased in general terms, provides that a\nnew criminal statute that \u201crepeal[s]\u201d an older criminal\nstatute shall not change the penalties \u201cincurred\u201d under\nthat older statute \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so ex-\npressly provide.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109. Case law makes clear\nthat the word \u201crepeal\u201d applies when a new statute simply\ndiminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth.\nSee Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 659\u2013664 (1974); see\nalso United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 92 (1871). Case\nlaw also makes clear that penalties are \u201cincurred\u201d under\nthe older statute when an offender becomes subject to\nthem, i.e., commits the underlying conduct that makes the\noffender liable. See United States v. Reisinger, 128 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n398, 401 (1888); Great Northern R. Co. v. United States,\n208 U. S. 452, 464\u2013470 (1908).\n   On the other hand, the Sentencing Reform Act says\nthat, regardless of when the offender\u2019s conduct occurs, the\napplicable Guidelines are the ones \u201cin effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\nAnd the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission\nto change the Guidelines in the wake of the Act\u2019s new\nminimums, making them consistent with \u201cother guideline\nprovisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78(2), 124 Stat. 2374.\n   Courts that have held that they must apply the old,\nhigher 1986 Drug Act minimums to all pre-Act offenders,\nincluding those sentenced after the Fair Sentencing Act\ntook effect, have emphasized that the 1871 Act requires\nthat result unless the Fair Sentencing Act either expressly\nsays or at least by fair implication implies the contrary.\nSee 635 F. 3d, at 339\u2013340; Sidney, supra, at 906\u2013908;\nTickles, supra, at 214\u2013215; see also Holcomb, supra, at\n446\u2013448 (opinion of Easterbrook, J.). Courts that have\nconcluded that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient\npenalties apply have found in that Act, together with the\nSentencing Reform Act and other related circumstances,\nindicia of a clear congressional intent to apply the new\nAct\u2019s minimums. See Douglas, supra, at 42\u201344; Dixon,\nsupra, at 199\u2013203; see also Holcomb, 657 F. 3d, at 454\u2013\n457 (Williams, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc); id., at 461\u2013463 (Posner, J., dissenting from denial\nof rehearing en banc). We too take the latter view. Six\nconsiderations, taken together, convince us that Congress\nintended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient penalties\nto apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded August\n3, 2010, but who are sentenced after that date.\n   First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply\na new Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders\nwithout expressly saying so in the new Act. It is true\nthat the 1871 Act uses the words \u201cexpressly provide.\u201d 1\n12               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7109. But the Court has long recognized that this\nsaving statute creates what is in effect a less demanding\ninterpretive requirement. That is because statutes en-\nacted by one Congress cannot bind a later Congress,\nwhich remains free to repeal the earlier statute, to exempt\nthe current statute from the earlier statute, to modify the\nearlier statute, or to apply the earlier statute but as modi-\nfied. See, e.g., Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810);\nReichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U. S. 315, 318 (1932). And\nCongress remains free to express any such intention either\nexpressly or by implication as it chooses.\n   Thus, the Court has said that the 1871 Act \u201ccannot\njustify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested\neither expressly or by necessary implication in a subse-\nquent enactment.\u201d Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465\n(emphasis added). And in a comparable context the Court\nhas emphasized that the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201cexpressly\u201d does not require Congress to\nuse any \u201cmagical passwords\u201d to exempt a later statute\nfrom the provision. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U. S. 302,\n310 (1955). Without requiring an \u201cexpress\u201d statement, the\nCourt has described the necessary indicia of congressional\nintent by the terms \u201cnecessary implication,\u201d \u201cclear impli-\ncation,\u201d and \u201cfair implication,\u201d phrases it has used inter-\nchangeably. Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465, 466;\nHertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 218 (1910); Marrero,\nsupra, at 660, n. 10. One Member of the Court has said\nwe should determine whether \u201cthe plain import of a later\nstatute directly conflicts with an earlier statute,\u201d and, if\nso, \u201cthe later enactment governs, regardless of its compli-\nance with any earlier-enacted requirement of an express\nreference or other \u2018magical password.\u2019 \u201d Lockhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 142, 149 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Hence, the Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting\nforth an important background principle of interpretation.\nThe Court has also assumed Congress is well aware of the\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbackground principle when it enacts new criminal stat-\nutes. E.g., Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465; Hertz,\nsupra, at 217; cf. Marcello, supra, at 310. And the prin-\nciple requires courts, before interpreting a new criminal\nstatute to apply its new penalties to a set of pre-Act of-\nfenders, to assure themselves that ordinary interpretive\nconsiderations point clearly in that direction. Words such\nas \u201cplain import,\u201d \u201cfair implication,\u201d or the like reflect the\nneed for that assurance. And it is that assurance, which\nwe shall assume is conveyed by the phrases \u201cplain import\u201d\nor \u201cfair implication,\u201d that we must look for here.\n   Second, the Sentencing Reform Act sets forth a special\nand different background principle. That statute says that\nwhen \u201cdetermining the particular sentence to be imposed\u201d\nin an initial sentencing, the sentencing court \u201cshall con-\nsider,\u201d among other things, the \u201csentencing range\u201d estab-\nlished by the Guidelines that are \u201cin effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii)\n(emphasis added). Although the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post\nFacto Clause, Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3, prohibits applying a new\nAct\u2019s higher penalties to pre-Act conduct, it does not pro-\nhibit applying lower penalties. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.\n386, 390\u2013391 (1798); Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S.\n37, 41\u201344 (1990). The Sentencing Commission has conse-\nquently instructed sentencing judges to \u201cuse the Guide-\nlines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is\nsentenced,\u201d regardless of when the defendant committed\nthe offense, unless doing so \u201cwould violate the ex post facto\nclause.\u201d USSG \u00a71B1.11. And therefore when the Com-\nmission adopts new, lower Guidelines amendments, those\namendments become effective to offenders who committed\nan offense prior to the adoption of the new amendments\nbut are sentenced thereafter. Just as we assume Congress\nwas aware of the 1871 Act\u2019s background norm, so we\nassume that Congress was aware of this different back-\nground sentencing principle.\n14              DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, language in the Fair Sentencing Act implies\nthat Congress intended to follow the Sentencing Reform Act\nbackground principle here. A section of the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act entitled \u201cEmergency Authority for United States\nSentencing Commission\u201d requires the Commission to prom-\nulgate \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d (and not later than 90\ndays after August 3, 2010) \u201cconforming amendments\u201d to\nthe Guidelines that \u201cachieve consistency with other guide-\nline provisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78, 124 Stat. 2374.\nRead most naturally, \u201capplicable law\u201d refers to the law as\nchanged by the Fair Sentencing Act, including the provi-\nsion reducing the crack mandatory minimums. \u00a72(a),\nid., at 2372. As the Commission understood this provi-\nsion, achieving consistency with \u201cother guideline provi-\nsions\u201d means reducing the base offense levels for all crack\namounts proportionally (using the new 18-to-1 ratio), in-\ncluding the offense levels governing small amounts of\ncrack that did not fall within the scope of the mandatory\nminimum provisions. 75 Fed. Reg. 66191. And consis-\ntency with \u201cother guideline provisions\u201d and with prior Com-\nmission practice would require application of the new\nGuidelines amendments to offenders who committed their\noffense prior to the new amendments\u2019 effective date but\nwere sentenced thereafter. See USSG \u00a71B1.11(a); e.g.,\nUSSG App. C, amdts. 706, 711 (Supp. Nov. 2004\u2013Nov.\n2007); see also Memorandum from G. Schmitt, L. Reed, &\nK. Cohen, USSC, to Chair Hinojosa et al., Subject: Analy-\nsis of the Impact of the Crack Cocaine Amendment if\nMade Retroactive 23 (Oct. 3, 2007). Cf. USSG App. C,\namdt. 571 (amendment increasing restitution, which may\npresent ex post facto and one-book-rule concerns, would\napply only to defendants sentenced for post-amendment\noffenses), discussed post, at 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old mandatory\nminimums to the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3\noffenders would create disparities of a kind that Congress\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act to prevent. Two individuals with the same number\nof prior offenses who each engaged in the same criminal\nconduct involving the same amount of crack and were\nsentenced at the same time would receive radically differ-\nent sentences. For example, a first-time post-Act offender\nwith five grams of crack, subject to a Guidelines range of\n21 to 27 months, could receive two years of imprisonment,\nwhile an otherwise identical pre-Act offender would have\nto receive the 5-year mandatory minimum. Compare\nUSSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)\n(2006 ed.). A first-time post-Act 50-gram offender would\nbe subject to a Guidelines range of less than six years of\nimprisonment, while his otherwise identical pre-Act coun-\nterpart would have to receive the 10-year mandatory\nminimum. Compare USSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) (2006 ed.).\n  Moreover, unlike many prechange/postchange discrep-\nancies, the imposition of these disparate sentences in-\nvolves roughly contemporaneous sentencing, i.e., the same\ntime, the same place, and even the same judge, thereby\nhighlighting a kind of unfairness that modern sentenc-\ning statutes typically seek to combat. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7991(b)(1)(B) (purposes of Guidelines-based sentencing\ninclude \u201cavoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities\namong defendants with similar records who have been\nfound guilty of similar criminal conduct\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98\u2013\n223, p. 74 (1983) (explaining rationale for using same,\ncurrent Guidelines for all roughly contemporaneous sen-\ntencings). Further, it would involve imposing upon the\npre-Act offender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Con-\ngress had specifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act\nthat such a sentence was unfairly long.\n  Finally, one cannot treat such problems as if they were\nminor ones. Given the 5-year statute of limitations for\nfederal drug offenses, the 11-month median time between\n16               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindictment and sentencing for those offenses, and the\napproximately 5,000 federal crack offenders convicted\neach year, many pre-Act offenders were not (and will not\nbe) sentenced until after August 3, 2010, when the new,\nmore lenient mandatory minimums took effect. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73282(a); Administrative Office of United States\nCourts, Judicial Business of the United States Courts,\np. 272 (2010) (Table D\u201310); 2011 Report 191.\n   Fifth, not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do\nmore than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would\nmake matters worse. It would create new anomalies\u2014new\nsets of disproportionate sentences\u2014not previously present.\nThat is because sentencing courts must apply new Guide-\nlines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new min-\nimums) to pre-Act offenders, see supra, at 13\u201314, and the\n1986 Drug Act\u2019s old minimums would trump those new\nGuidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of\nthem\u2014say, pre-Act offenders who possessed crack in small\namounts not directly the subject of mandatory minimums.\n   Consider, for example, a first-time offender convicted of\npossessing with intent to distribute four grams of crack.\nNo mandatory sentence, under the 1986 Drug Act or the\nFair Sentencing Act, applies to an offender possessing so\nsmall an amount. Yet under the old law, the Commission,\ncharged with creating proportionate sentences, had created\na Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months for such an of-\nfender, a sentence proportional to the 60 months that\nthe 1986 Drug Act required for one who trafficked five\ngrams of crack. See supra, at 5\u20136; USSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov.\n2009).\n   The Fair Sentencing Act, however, requires the Com-\nmission to write new Guidelines consistent with the new\nlaw. The Commission therefore wrote new Guidelines that\nprovide a sentencing range of 21 to 27 months\u2014about\ntwo years\u2014for the first-time, 4-gram offender. See USSG\n\u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011). And the Sentencing Reform Act\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires application of those new Guidelines to all of-\nfenders (including pre-Act offenders) who are sentenced\nonce those new Guidelines take effect. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii). Those new Guidelines must take effect\nand apply to a pre-Act 4-gram offender, for such an of-\nfender was never subject to a trumping statutory 1986\nDrug Act mandatory minimum. However, unless the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s new, more lenient mandatory mini-\nmums apply to pre-Act offenders, an otherwise identical of-\nfender who possessed five grams would have to receive a\n5-year sentence. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV).\n  For example, imagine that on July 1, 2010, both Smith\nand Jones commit a crack crime identical but for the fact\nthat Smith possesses with intent to distribute four grams\nof crack and Jones five grams. Both are sentenced on\nDecember 1, 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act and the\nnew Guidelines take effect. Smith\u2019s Guidelines sentence\nwould be two years, but unless the Fair Sentencing Act\napplies, Jones\u2019s sentence would have to be five years. The\ndifference of one gram would make a difference, not of only\none year as it did before enactment of the Fair Sentencing\nAct, but instead of three years. Passage of the new Act,\ndesigned to have brought about fairer sentences, would\nhere have created a new disparate sentencing \u201ccliff.\u201d\n  Nor can one say that the new Act would produce dispro-\nportionalities like this in only a few cases. In fiscal year\n2010, 17.8 percent of all crack offenders were convicted of-\noffenses not subject to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s minimums.\n2011 Report 191. And since those minimums apply only to\nsome drug offenders and they apply in different ways, one\ncan find many similar examples of disproportionalities.\nSee Appendix B, infra. Thus, application of the 1986 Drug\nAct minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after the\nnew Guidelines take effect would produce a crazy quilt of\nsentences, at odds with Congress\u2019 basic efforts to achieve\n18               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore uniform, more proportionate sentences. Congress,\nwhen enacting the Fair Sentencing Act, could not have\nintended any such result.\n   Sixth, we have found no strong countervailing considera-\ntion. Amicus and the dissent argue that one might read\nmuch of the statutory language we have discussed as\nembodying exceptions, permitting the old 1986 Drug Act\nminimums to apply to pre-Act offenders sentenced after\nAugust 3, 2010, when the Fair Sentencing Act took effect.\nThe words \u201capplicable law\u201d in the new Act, for example,\ncould, linguistically speaking, encompass the 1986 Drug\nAct minimums applied to those sentenced after August 3.\nPost, at 4\u20136 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Moreover, Congress\ncould have insisted that the Commission write new Guide-\nlines with special speed to assure itself that new, post-\nAugust 3 offenders\u2014but not old, pre-August 3 offenders\u2014\nwould receive the benefit of the new Act. Post, at 6\u20138.\nFurther, amicus and the dissent note that to apply the\nnew Act\u2019s minimums to the old, pre-August 3 offenders\nwill create a new disparity\u2014one between pre-Act offenders\nsentenced before August 3 and those sentenced after that\ndate. Post, at 9.\n   We do not believe that these arguments make a critical\ndifference. Even if the relevant statutory language can\nbe read as amicus and the dissent suggest and even if\nCongress might have wanted Guidelines written speedily\nsimply in order to apply them quickly to new offenders,\nthere is scant indication that this is what Congress did\nmean by the language in question nor that such was in\nfact Congress\u2019 motivation. The considerations we have set\nforth, supra, at 13\u201317 and this page, strongly suggest the\ncontrary.\n   We also recognize that application of the new minimums\nto pre-Act offenders sentenced after August 3 will create\na new set of disparities. But those disparities, reflecting a\nline-drawing effort, will exist whenever Congress enacts a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnew law changing sentences (unless Congress intends re-\nopening sentencing proceedings concluded prior to a new\nlaw\u2019s effective date). We have explained how in federal\nsentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties\nto defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that\nchange from defendants already sentenced. Supra, at 13;\ncompare 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) with \u00a73582(c). And\nwe have explained how, here, continued application of\nthe old 1986 Drug Act minimums to those pre-Act offend-\ners sentenced after August 3 would make matters worse.\nSupra, at 16\u201318. We consequently conclude that this\nparticular new disparity (between those pre-Act offenders\nalready sentenced and those not yet sentenced as of\nAugust 3) cannot make a critical difference.\n  For these reasons considered as a whole, we conclude\nthat Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new,\nlower mandatory minimums to apply to the post-Act\nsentencing of pre-Act offenders. That is the Act\u2019s \u201cplain\nimport\u201d or \u201cfair implication.\u201d\n                              B\n  We add one final point. Several arguments we have\ndiscussed involve the language of statutes that determine\nhow new Guidelines take effect. Supra, at 13\u201314. What\nabout those who committed an offense prior to August 3\nand were sentenced after August 3 but before November 1,\n2010\u2014a period after the new Act\u2019s effective date but before\nthe new Guidelines first took effect? Do the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act\u2019s new mandatory minimums apply to them?\n  In our view, the new Act\u2019s lower minimums apply to\nthem as well. Our reason is that the statute simply in-\nstructs the Commission to promulgate new Guidelines \u201cas\nsoon as practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the\nAct took effect). \u00a78(1), 124 Stat. 2374. As far as Congress\nwas concerned, the Commission might have (having\nprepared new Guidelines in advance) promulgated those\n20              DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGuidelines within a few days\u2014perhaps on August 3 itself.\nAt the same time, the Commission possesses ample au-\nthority to permit appropriate adjustments to be made in\nthe Guidelines sentences of those sentenced after August 3\nbut prior to the new Guidelines promulgation. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(u) (power to make Guidelines reductions\nretroactive); 76 Fed. Reg. 41333\u201341334 (2011) (amended\n18-to-1 Guidelines made retroactive).       In any event,\ncourts, treating the Guidelines as advisory, possess au-\nthority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.\n  For these reasons, if the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new\nminimums apply to all of those sentenced after August 3,\n2010 (even if the new Guidelines were not yet ready), it is\npossible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition. On the\nother hand, it is difficult to foresee such a transition if\nthe new Act\u2019s application is keyed to a later date, thereby\nleaving the courts unable to take the new Act fully into\naccount, particularly when that circumstance might create\nadditional disparities and uncertainties that courts and\nthe Commission may be helpless to correct. We have no\nreason to believe Congress would have wanted to impose\nan unforeseeable, potentially complex application date.\n                       *    *    *\n  We vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgments and remand\nthese cases for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

For one\nthing, it would create sentencing \u201ccliffs\u201d at the 1986 Act\u2019s\nold triggering amounts of 5 grams and 50 grams (where\nthe old minimums would entirely trump the new Guide-\nlines), resulting in radically different Guidelines sentences\n24                DORSEY v.

For another, because of\nthose \u201ccliffs,\u201d the scheme would create similar Guidelines\nsentences for offenders who dealt in radically different\namounts of crack, e.g., 50 grams versus 500 grams.\n   To be sure, as amicus points out, Congress has provided\ntwo mechanisms through which an offender may escape\nan otherwise applicable mandatory minimum, diminishing\nthis problem for some offenders. First, an offender may\nescape a minimum by providing substantial assistance\nin the investigation or prosecution of another person. 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(e); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b); see also 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(n); USSG \u00a75K1.1. Second, under 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73553(f), drug offenders who have little or no criminal\nhistory and who satisfy other requirements in the provi-\nsion may obtain \u201csafety valve\u201d relief. See also USSG \u00a75C1.2.\nAnd because of these mechanisms a substantial portion\nof first-time offenders are relieved of application of a manda-\ntory minimum. However, offenders with a criminal his-\ntory category of II or higher are ineligible for \u201csafety\nvalve\u201d relief; they escape application of a minimum at a\nmuch lower percentage.

The Act is silent\nas to whether these changes apply to defendants who\ncommitted their offenses before, but whose sentencing\nproceedings occurred after, its August 3, 2010, effective\ndate. In my view, the general saving statute, 1 U. S. C.\n\u00a7109, dictates that the new, more lenient mandatory\nminimum provisions do not apply to such pre-enactment\noffenders.\n                             I\n  The Court starts off on the right foot by acknowledging,\nante, at 10\u201311, that the ameliorative amendments at issue\n2                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhere trigger application of the general saving statute.\nEnacted in 1871 to reverse the common-law rule that the\nrepeal or amendment of a criminal statute would abate all\nnonfinal convictions under the repealed or amended stat-\nute, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 660 (1974), the\nsaving statute provides in relevant part:\n      \u201cThe repeal of any statute shall not have the effect\n    to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or lia-\n    bility incurred under such statute, unless the repeal-\n    ing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute\n    shall be treated as still remaining in force for the pur-\n    pose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for\n    the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liabil-\n    ity.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109.\nBy reducing the statutory penalties for crack cocaine\noffenses, the Fair Sentencing Act \u201crepeal[ed]\u201d the former\npenalties; for defendants who committed their offenses\n(and hence \u201cincurred\u201d the penalties) while the prior law\nwas in force, \u00a7109 directs that the prior law \u201cshall be\ntreated as still remaining in force.\u201d\n   Although \u00a7109 purports to require that subsequent\nlegislation opting out of its default rule must do so \u201cex-\npressly,\u201d the Court correctly observes, ante, at 12, that\nexpress-statement requirements of this sort are ineffec-\ntive. See Lockhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 142, 147\u2013\n150 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring). Because \u201cone legis-\nlature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legisla-\nture,\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810), a statute\nis \u201calterable when the legislature shall please to alter it,\u201d\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Conse-\nquently, the express-statement requirement of \u00a7109 is\nitself subject to repeal on the same terms as any other\nstatute, which is to say that a repeal may be accomplished\nby implication. See, e.g., Marrero, supra, at 659\u2013660,\nn. 10; Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n452, 465 (1908).\n  Understanding the interpretive problem posed by these\ncases as one of implied repeal helps to explain the Court\u2019s\nobservation, ante, at 13, that what is required to override\n\u00a7109\u2019s default rule is a clear demonstration of congres-\nsional intent to do so. Admittedly, our cases have not\nspoken with the utmost clarity on this point. In Marrero,\nfor example, we suggested that a \u201cfair implication\u201d from\na subsequently enacted statute would suffice, 417 U. S.,\nat 660, n. 10, while in Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205\n(1910), we used the phrase \u201cclear implication,\u201d id., at 218\n(emphasis added); see also ibid. (\u201cplain implication\u201d). In\nGreat Northern R. Co., we split the difference, stating at\none point that \u00a7109 controls unless Congress expresses a\ncontrary intention \u201ceither expressly or by necessary impli-\ncation in a subsequent enactment,\u201d 208 U. S., at 465 (em-\nphasis added), but suggesting at another point that a \u201cfair\nimplication,\u201d id., at 466, would do. In my view, the \u201cfair\nimplication\u201d formulation understates the burden properly\nimposed on a defendant who would claim an implicit\nexception from \u00a7109\u2019s terms. Because the effect of such\nan exception is to work a pro tanto repeal of \u00a7109\u2019s appli-\ncation to the defendant\u2019s case, the implication from the\nsubsequently enacted statute must be clear enough to\novercome our strong presumption against implied repeals.\nSee, e.g., Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516\nU. S. 367, 381 (1996); Posadas v. National City Bank, 296\nU. S. 497, 503 (1936). Thus, we should conclude that\nCongress has deviated from \u00a7109 (or any similar statute\nestablishing a background interpretive principle) only\nwhen the \u201cplain import of a later statute directly conflicts\u201d\nwith it. Lockhart, supra, at 149 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(emphasis added).\n4                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  The considerations relied upon by the Court do not come\nclose to satisfying the demanding standard for repeal by\nimplication. As an initial matter, there is no persuasive\nforce whatever to the Court\u2019s observation that continuing\nto apply the prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment\noffenders would \u201cinvolve imposing upon the pre-Act of-\nfender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Congress had\nspecifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act that such a\nsentence was unfairly long.\u201d Ante, at 15. That is true\nwhenever Congress reduces a criminal penalty, and so is a\nconsequence that Congress affirmatively embraced when it\nsaid in \u00a7109 that ameliorative amendments to criminal\nstatutes do not apply to pre-enactment conduct. Nor does\nit matter that Congress has instructed district courts,\nwhen applying the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, to ap-\nply the version in force on the date of sentencing, with\nthe object of reducing disparities in sentences between\nsimilar defendants who are sentenced for the same con-\nduct at the same time. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\nThe presumption against implied repeals requires us to\ngive effect, if possible, to both \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) and \u00a7109.\n\u201cThe courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among\ncongressional enactments, and when two statutes are ca-\npable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent\na clearly expressed congressional intention to the con-\ntrary, to regard each as effective.\u201d Morton v. Mancari, 417\nU. S. 535, 551 (1974). We may readily do so here by hold-\ning that \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) applies to Guidelines amend-\nments, and \u00a7109 to statutory ones.\n  The Court also stresses that the Fair Sentencing Act\ninstructs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate \u201cas\nsoon as practicable\u201d (and not later than 90 days after\nAugust 3, 2010) \u201csuch conforming amendments\u201d to the\nSentencing Guidelines \u201cas the Commission determines\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnecessary to achieve consistency with other guideline\nprovisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78, 124 Stat. 2374. The\nargument goes that, because the Commission implemented\nthis directive by reducing the Guidelines ranges for\ncrack cocaine offenses to track the 18-to-1 crack-to-powder\nratio reflected in the new mandatory minimums, see 75\nFed. Reg. 66191 (2010), and because the general rule is\nthat a sentencing court should apply the version of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, see 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), Congress must have understood\nthat the new mandatory minimums would apply immedi-\nately, since otherwise there would be a mismatch between\nthe statutory penalties and Guidelines ranges.\n   That conclusion simply does not follow. For one thing,\nthe argument begs the very question presented here: What\nis the \u201capplicable law\u201d relevant to pre-enactment offenders\nwho are sentenced after enactment? The Commission\ncould well have answered this question by concluding that,\nin light of \u00a7109, the law applicable to such offenders is\nthe pre-Act mandatory minimums. It might therefore have\nretained, as to those offenders, the existing Guidelines\nranges reflecting a higher crack-to-powder ratio. Although\nrare, it is not unheard of for the Commission to establish\nGuidelines whose application turns on the date of commis-\nsion of the defendant\u2019s offense. See United States Sen-\ntencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a75E1.1(g)(1)\n(Nov. 2011) (governing restitution for offenses committed\non or after November 1, 1997, and providing that the prior\nversion of the Guideline shall govern all other cases); id.,\n\u00a78B1.1(f)(1) (same for restitution obligations of organiza-\ntional defendants). Of course, the Commission did not\ninterpret the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s directive in this man-\nner. But the possibility that it could (not to mention\nthe probability that it should) have done so illustrates the\nfolly of basing inferences about what Congress intended\nwhen it passed the Fair Sentencing Act on decisions the\n6                  DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCommission would not make until several months later.1\n   Moreover, even if one takes it as given that the Com-\nmission\u2019s new crack cocaine Guidelines would apply the\nlower 18-to-1 ratio to all defendants sentenced after the\nnew Guidelines were put in place, it would not follow that\nCongress necessarily expected the new mandatory mini-\nmums to apply to pre-enactment offenders. The directive\nto update the Guidelines on an emergency basis is equally\nconsistent with Congress\u2019s seeking to avoid a mismatch\nbetween the Guidelines and the statutory penalties for\npost-enactment offenders sentenced shortly after the Act\u2019s\neffective date.\n   Petitioners and the Government discount this explana-\ntion, noting that because of the lags associated with in-\nvestigating and prosecuting drug offenses, most of the\ndefendants sentenced on the 91st day after the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s enactment were sure to be pre-Act of-\nfenders. If Congress did not expect the new mandatory\nminimums to apply to such offenders, they say, there\nwould have been no need to ensure that revised Guidelines\nwere in place so quickly. But most is not all, and it would\nhave been entirely sensible for Congress to worry that\nsome post-Act offenders\u2014offenders clearly subject to the\nnew mandatory minimums\u2014would nonetheless be sen-\ntenced under outdated Guidelines if the Guidelines were\nnot revised in short order.\n   The 11-month median time between indictment and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Congressional reliance on future Commission action might be plau-\n\nsible if the Commission had a settled practice of tying reductions in\nstatutory mandatory minimums to immediately applicable reductions\nin Guidelines ranges, without any distinction based on the timing of\nthe defendant\u2019s offense. But the Court does not cite any such settled\npractice, and I am not aware of any. Presumably there has been no\noccasion for a practice to develop either way, since congressional\nlegislation reducing criminal penalties is, in this day and age, very\nrare.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    7\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsentencing for non-marijuana federal drug offenses, see\nAdministrative Office of United States Courts, Judicial\nBusiness of the United States Courts, p. 272 (2010) (Table\nD\u201310), does not establish that prompt issuance of new\nGuidelines for post-Act offenders could not have been a\npressing concern. Because that is a median figure, it shows\nthat half of all drug defendants are sentenced sooner\nthan 11 months after being indicted. And it is only an\naggregate figure. For drug possession offenses\u2014relevant\nhere because the Fair Sentencing Act eliminated the\nmandatory minimum sentence previously applicable to\nsimple possession of crack cocaine, see \u00a73, 124 Stat.\n2372\u2014the equivalent figure was just 5.4 months from\nindictment to sentencing. The pace of criminal cases also\nvaries considerably from district to district. In the East-\nern District of Virginia, for instance, the median time from\nindictment to sentencing for all criminal cases was just 3.6\nmonths. See Judicial Business, supra, at 252 (Table D\u20136).\nWhat is more, without the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s emer-\ngency directive, amendments to the Guidelines to implement\nthe Act likely would not have been put in place until more\nthan a year after its passage.2 In the interim, a great\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In the ordinary course, the Commission may submit proposed\n\nGuidelines amendments to Congress \u201cat or after the beginning of a\nregular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(p).    Unless disapproved by Congress, the proposed\namendments \u201ctake effect on a date specified by the Commission, which\nshall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no\nlater than the first day of November of the calendar year in which\nthe amendment . . . is submitted.\u201d Ibid. As a matter of practice, the\nCommission has adopted November 1 as the default effective date for\nits proposed amendments. See United States Sentencing Commission,\nRules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 4.1 (amended Aug. 2007).\nBecause the Fair Sentencing Act was enacted on August 3, 2010\u2014after\nMay 1\u2014there would have been no opportunity for the Commission to\nsubmit proposed amendments to Congress until January 2011. Given\nthe 180-day waiting period, the amendments could not have gone into\nforce until the very end of June 2011 at the earliest. And in all likeli-\n8                   DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmany post-Act offenders might have been sentenced under\nthe outdated Guidelines, even though they were clearly\nentitled to take advantage of the statutory amendments.\nBecause the emergency authority conferred on the Com-\nmission can reasonably be understood as directed at this\nmismatch problem, it creates no clear implication that\nCongress expected the new statutory penalties to apply to\npre-enactment offenders.\n  The Court\u2019s last argument is that continuing to apply\nthe prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment offend-\ners would lead to anomalous, disproportionate sentencing\nresults. It is true enough, as the Court notes, ante, at 16\u2013\n18, that applying the prior mandatory minimums in tan-\ndem with the new Guidelines provisions\u2014which track the\nnew, more lenient mandatory minimums\u2014leads to a\nseries of \u201ccliffs\u201d at the mandatory minimum thresholds.\nBut this does not establish that Congress clearly meant\nthe new mandatory minimums to apply to pre-enactment\noffenders. As noted above, supra, at 5\u20136, there is no rea-\nson to take the Guidelines amendments ultimately prom-\nulgated by the Commission as a given when evaluating\nwhat Congress would have understood when the Fair\nSentencing Act was enacted. The Commission could have\npromulgated amendments that ameliorated this problem\nby retaining the old Guidelines ranges for pre-enactment\noffenders.\n  Moreover, although the cliffs produced by the mismatch\nbetween Guidelines and statutory penalties are admittedly\ninconsistent with the premise of the Guidelines system\nthat sentences should vary in proportion to the gravity\nof the offense and the culpability of the offender, see 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), the same objection can be\nlodged against any mandatory minimum that trumps an\notherwise applicable Guidelines range. And it is not as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhood, they would not have been effective until November 1, 2011.\n\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthough the results of continuing to apply the pre-Act\nstatutory penalties are so senseless as to establish that\nCongress must not have intended them. Retaining the old\nmandatory minimums ensures at least rough equivalence\nin sentences for defendants who committed their crimes at\nthe same time, but were sentenced at different times\u2014\neven as it leads to disparities for defendants who are sen-\ntenced at the same time, but committed their offenses\nat different times. In light of this plausible basis for con-\ntinuing to apply the prior law to pre-enactment offenders,\nthere is no reason to conclude that Congress necessarily\nexpected the new statutory penalties to apply.\n                             B\n  Petitioners and the Government press a handful of ad-\nditional arguments which require only brief discussion.\nThey first contend that an intention to apply the new\nmandatory minimums to pre-enactment offenders can be\ninferred from \u00a710 of the Fair Sentencing Act, 124 Stat.\n2375, which instructs the Commission to study the effects\nof the new law and make a report to Congress within five\nyears. The suggestion is that, if the statutory penalties do\nnot apply to pre-enactment offenders, then the Act would\nhave no effect on many defendants sentenced during\nthe study period, which would in turn undermine Con-\ngress\u2019s goal of compiling useful data. This is makeweight.\nWhether or not the new mandatory minimums are held\napplicable to pre-enactment offenders, they will be applied\nto many post-enactment offenders during the study period,\nand the Commission will have the opportunity to collect\nuseful data. The study provision simply has nothing to\nsay about the question at issue here.\n  The Government also notes that the Senate bill that\nultimately became the Fair Sentencing Act was based on\nan earlier bill which contained a provision that would\nhave delayed the Act\u2019s effective date until 180 days after\n10               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npassage, and specifically provided that \u201c[t]here shall be no\nretroactive application of any portion of this Act.\u201d H. R.\n265, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a711 (2009). Even if one is\ninclined to base inferences about statutory meaning on\nunenacted versions of the relevant bill, but see Hamdan v.\nRumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 668 (2006) (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning), this argument from drafting history is unpersuasive.\nThat Congress considered and rejected a proposal that\nwould have delayed application of the Act until 180 days\nafter passage says nothing about whether the version\nfinally enacted applies to defendants whose criminal con-\nduct pre-dated the Act. Moreover, the same bill would\nhave provided permissive authority for the Commission to\npromulgate amended Guidelines on an emergency basis,\nsee \u00a78(a), notwithstanding its delayed effective date provi-\nsion. This point undercuts the argument that emergency\namendment authority and immediate application of the\nnew statutory penalties go hand-in-hand.\n   Petitioners finally appeal to the rule of lenity and the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance. But the rule of lenity\nhas no application here, because the background principle\nsupplied by \u00a7109 serves to remove the ambiguity that is a\nnecessary precondition to invocation of the rule. See Deal\nv. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 135 (1993). The canon\nof constitutional avoidance also has no application here.\nAlthough many observers viewed the 100-to-1 crack-to-\npowder ratio under the prior law as having a racially\ndisparate impact, see, e.g., United States Sentencing\nCommission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and\nFederal Sentencing Policy 8 (Apr. 1997), only intentional\ndiscrimination may violate the equal protection component\nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. See Ar\u00ad\nlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development\nCorp., 429 U. S. 252, 264\u2013265 (1977); Adarand Construc\u00ad\ntors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 217 (1995).

Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\n                          *    *     *\n   In the end, the mischief of the Court\u2019s opinion is not the\nresult in this particular case, but rather the unpredictabil-\nity it injects into the law for the future. The Court\u2019s de-\ncision is based on \u201c[s]ix considerations, taken together,\u201d\nante, at 11, and we are not told whether any one of these\nconsiderations might have justified the Court\u2019s result in\nisolation, or even the relative importance of the various\nconsiderations. One of them (the Commission\u2019s emergency\nauthority to issue conforming amendments to the Guide-\nlines) is a particular feature of the statute at issue in these\ncases, but another (the fact that applying the prior statu-\ntory penalties alongside the new Guidelines leads to a\nmismatch) is a general feature of a sentencing scheme\nthat calibrates Guidelines ranges to the statutory manda-\ntory minimums for a given offense. Are we to conclude\nthat, after the Sentencing Reform Act, \u00a7109 has no further\napplication to criminal penalties, at least when statutory\namendments lead to modification of the Guidelines? Por-\ntions of the Court\u2019s opinion could be understood to sug-\ngest that result, but the Court leaves us in suspense.\n   That is most unfortunate, because the whole point of\n\u00a7109, as well as other provisions of the Dictionary Act, see\n1 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71\u20138, and the definitional provisions of the\nfederal criminal law, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75\u201327 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV), is to provide a stable set of background princi-\nples that will promote effective communication between\nCongress and the courts. In this context, stability is en-\nsured by a healthy respect for our presumption against\nimplied repeals, which demands a clear showing before we\nconclude that Congress has deviated from one of these\nbackground interpretive principles.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11\u20135683. Argued April 17, 2012\u2014Decided June 21, 2012*\nUnder the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug Act), the 5- and 10-year\n mandatory minimum prison terms for federal drug crimes reflected a\n 100-to-1 disparity between the amounts of crack cocaine and powder\n cocaine needed to trigger the minimums. Thus, the 5-year minimum\n was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to distribute\n 5 grams of crack cocaine but 500 grams of powder, and the 10-year\n minimum was triggered by a conviction for possessing with intent to\n distribute 50 grams of crack but 5,000 grams of powder. The United\n States Sentencing Commission\u2014which is charged under the Sentenc-\n ing Reform Act of 1984 with writing the Federal Sentencing Guide-\n lines\u2014incorporated the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 100-to-1 disparity into the\n Guidelines because it believed that doing so was the best way to keep\n similar drug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying\n the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s basic proportionality objective. The Fair\n Sentencing Act, which took effect on August 3, 2010, reduced the dis-\n parity to 18-to-1, lowering the mandatory minimums applicable to\n many crack offenders, by increasing the amount of crack needed to\n trigger the 5-year minimum from 5 to 28 grams and the amount for\n the 10-year minimum from 50 to 280 grams, while leaving the pow-\n der cocaine amounts intact. It also directed the Sentencing Commis-\n sion to make conforming amendments to the Guidelines \u201cas soon as\n practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s\n effective date). The new amendments became effective on November\n 1, 2010.\n    In No. 11\u22125721, petitioner Hill unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u20135721, Hill v. United States, also on certiorari\nto the same court.\n2                     DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    2007, but was not sentenced until December 2010. Sentencing him to\n    the 10-year minimum mandated by the 1986 Drug Act, the District\n    Judge ruled that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s 5-year minimum for sell-\n    ing that amount of crack did not apply to those whose offenses were\n    committed before the Act\u2019s effective date. In No. 11\u22125683, petitioner\n    Dorsey unlawfully sold 5.5 grams of crack in 2008. In September\n    2010, the District Judge sentenced him to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 10-\n    year minimum, finding that it applied because Dorsey had a prior\n    drug conviction and declining to apply the Fair Sentencing Act, under\n    which there would be no mandated minimum term for an amount\n    less than 28 grams, because Dorsey\u2019s offense predated that Act\u2019s ef-\n    fective date. The Seventh Circuit affirmed in both cases.\nHeld: The Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new, lower mandatory minimums ap-\n ply to the post-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders. Pp. 10\u221220.\n    (a) Language in different statutes argues in opposite directions.\n The general federal saving statute (1871 Act) provides that a new\n criminal statute that \u201crepeal[s]\u201d an older criminal statute shall not\n change the penalties \u201cincurred\u201d under that older statute \u201cunless the\n repealing Act shall so expressly provide.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109. The word\n \u201crepeal\u201d applies when a new statute simply diminishes the penalties\n that the older statute set forth, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653,\n 659\u2212664, and penalties are \u201cincurred\u201d under the older statute when\n an offender becomes subject to them, i.e., commits the underlying\n conduct that makes the offender liable, see United States v.\n Reisinger, 128 U. S. 398, 401. In contrast, the Sentencing Reform Act\n says that, regardless of when the offender\u2019s conduct occurs, the appli-\n cable sentencing guidelines are the ones \u201cin effect on the date the de-\n fendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\n    Six considerations, taken together, show that Congress intended\n the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to apply to offenders\n who committed crimes before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced af-\n ter that date. First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to ap-\n ply a new Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders without\n expressly saying so in the new Act. The 1871 Act creates what is in\n effect a less demanding interpretive requirement because the statute\n \u201ccannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested, ei-\n ther expressly or by necessary implication, in a subsequent enact-\n ment.\u201d Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S. 452, 465.\n Hence, this Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting forth an im-\n portant background principle of interpretation that requires courts,\n before interpreting a new criminal statute to apply its new penalties\n to a set of pre-Act offenders, to assure themselves by the \u201cplain im-\n port\u201d or \u201cfair implication\u201d of the new statute that ordinary interpre-\n tive considerations point clearly in that direction. Second, the Sen-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ntencing Reform Act sets forth a special and different background\nprinciple in \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which applies unless ex post facto con-\ncerns are present. Thus, new, lower Guidelines amendments apply to\noffenders who committed an offense before the adoption of the\namendments but are sentenced thereafter. Third, language in the\nFair Sentencing Act implies that Congress intended to follow the\nSentencing Reform Act\u2019s special background principle here. Section 8\nof the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission to promulgate\nconforming amendments to the Guidelines that \u201cachieve consistency\nwith other guideline provisions and applicable law.\u201d Read most nat-\nurally, \u201capplicable law\u201d refers to the law as changed by the Fair Sen-\ntencing Act, including the provision reducing the crack mandatory\nminimums. And consistency with \u201cother guideline provisions\u201d and\nwith prior Commission practice would require application of the new\nGuidelines amendments to offenders who committed their offense be-\nfore the new amendments\u2019 effective date but were sentenced thereaf-\nter. Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old mandatory minimums\nto the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3 offenders would cre-\nate sentencing disparities of a kind that Congress enacted the Sen-\ntencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentencing Act to prevent. Fifth,\nnot to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do more than preserve a\ndisproportionate status quo; it would make matters worse by creating\nnew anomalies\u2015new sets of disproportionate sentences\u2015not previous-\nly present. That is because sentencing courts must apply the new\nGuidelines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new mini-\nmums) to pre-Act offenders, and the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old minimums\nwould trump those new Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not\nfor all of them. Application of the 1986 Drug Act minimums to pre-\nAct offenders sentenced after the new Guidelines take effect would\ntherefore produce a set of sentences at odds with Congress\u2019 basic ef-\nforts to create more uniform, more proportionate sentences. Sixth,\nthis Court has found no strong countervailing considerations that\nwould make a critical difference. Pp. 10\u221219.\n   (b) The new Act\u2019s lower minimums also apply to those who commit-\nted an offense prior to August 3 and were sentenced between that\ndate and November 1, 2010, the effective date of the new Guidelines.\nThe Act simply instructs the Commission to promulgate new Guide-\nlines \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the Act\ntook effect), and thus as far as Congress was concerned, the Commis-\nsion might have promulgated those Guidelines to be effective as early\nas August 3. In any event, courts, treating the Guidelines as advi-\nsory, possess authority to sentence in accordance with the new mini-\nmums. Finally, applying the new minimums to all who are sentenced\nafter August 3 makes it possible to foresee a reasonably smooth tran-\n4                    DORSEY v.

Until 2010, the relevant statute imposed upon an\noffender who dealt in powder cocaine the same sentence it\nimposed upon an offender who dealt in one one-hundredth\nthat amount of crack cocaine. It imposed, for example, the\nsame 5-year minimum term upon (1) an offender convicted\nof possessing with intent to distribute 500 grams of pow-\nder cocaine as upon (2) an offender convicted of possessing\nwith intent to distribute 5 grams of crack.\n  In 2010, Congress enacted a new statute reducing the\ncrack-to-powder cocaine disparity from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1.\nFair Sentencing Act, 124 Stat. 2372. The new statute took\n2               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffect on August 3, 2010. The question here is whether\nthe Act\u2019s more lenient penalty provisions apply to offend-\ners who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3,\n2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3. We\nhold that the new, more lenient mandatory minimum\nprovisions do apply to those pre-Act offenders.\n                               I\n   The underlying question before us is one of congres-\nsional intent as revealed in the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s lan-\nguage, structure, and basic objectives. Did Congress\nintend the Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to apply to pre-Act\noffenders sentenced after the Act took effect?\n   We recognize that, because of important background\nprinciples of interpretation, we must assume that Con-\ngress did not intend those penalties to apply unless it\nclearly indicated to the contrary. See infra, at 10\u201313. But\nwe find that clear indication here. We rest our conclu-\nsion primarily upon the fact that a contrary determination\nwould seriously undermine basic Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines objectives such as uniformity and proportional-\nity in sentencing. Indeed, seen from that perspective, a\ncontrary determination would (in respect to relevant\ngroups of drug offenders) produce sentences less uniform\nand more disproportionate than if Congress had not en-\nacted the Fair Sentencing Act at all. See infra, at 14\u201318.\n   Because our conclusion rests upon an analysis of the\nGuidelines-based sentencing system Congress has estab-\nlished, we describe that system at the outset and include\nan explanation of how the Guidelines interact with federal\nstatutes setting forth specific terms of imprisonment.\n                           A\n  The Guidelines originate in the Sentencing Reform Act\nof 1984, 98 Stat. 1987. That statute created a federal\nSentencing Commission instructed to write guidelines that\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudges would use to determine sentences imposed upon\noffenders convicted of committing federal crimes. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991, 994. Congress thereby sought to increase\ntransparency, uniformity, and proportionality in sentenc-\ning. United States Sentencing Commission (USSC or\nCommission), Guidelines Manual \u00a71A1.3, p. 2 (Nov. 2011)\n(USSG); see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7991(b)(1), 994(f).\n   The Sentencing Reform Act directed the Commission to\ncreate in the Guidelines categories of offense behavior\n(e.g., \u201c \u2018bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken\u2019 \u201d)\nand offender characteristics (e.g., \u201cone prior conviction\u201d).\nUSSG \u00a71A1.2, at 1; see 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7994(a)\u2013(e). A sen-\ntencing judge determines a Guidelines range by (1) finding\nthe applicable offense level and offender category and then\n(2) consulting a table that lists proportionate sentenc-\ning ranges (e.g., 18 to 24 months of imprisonment) at the\nintersections of rows (marking offense levels) and columns\n(marking offender categories). USSG ch. 5, pt. A, Sen-\ntencing Table, \u00a7\u00a75E1.2, 7B1.4; see also \u00a71A1.4(h), at 11.\nThe Guidelines, after telling the judge how to determine the\napplicable offense level and offender category, instruct the\njudge to apply the intersection\u2019s range in an ordinary case,\nbut they leave the judge free to depart from that range in\nan unusual case. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(b); USSG \u00a7\u00a71A1.2,\nat 1\u20132, 1A1.4(b), at 6\u20137. This Court has held that the\nGuidelines are now advisory. United States v. Booker, 543\nU. S. 220, 245, 264 (2005); see Kimbrough v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 85, 91 (2007).\n   The Guidelines determine most drug-crime offense lev-\nels in a special way. They set forth a Drug Quantity\nTable (or Table) that lists amounts of various drugs and\nassociates different amounts with different \u201cBase Offense\nLevels\u201d (to which a judge may add or subtract levels de-\npending upon the \u201cspecific\u201d characteristics of the offender\u2019s\nbehavior). See USSG \u00a72D1.1. The Table, for example,\nassociates 400 to 499 grams of powder cocaine with a base\n4                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffense level of 24, a level that would mean for a first-time\noffender a prison term of 51 to 63 months. \u00a72D1.1(c).\n   In 1986, Congress enacted a more specific, drug-related\nsentencing statute, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986 Drug\nAct), 100 Stat. 3207. That statute sets forth mandatory\nminimum penalties of 5 and 10 years applicable to a drug\noffender depending primarily upon the kind and amount of\ndrugs involved in the offense. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)\n(A)\u2013(C) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV). The minimum applicable\nto an offender convicted of possessing with intent to dis-\ntribute 500 grams or more of powder cocaine is 5 years,\nand for 5,000 grams or more of powder the minimum is\n10 years. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B)(ii). The 1986 Drug Act,\nhowever, treated crack cocaine crimes as far more serious.\nIt applied its 5-year minimum to an offender convicted of\npossessing with intent to distribute only 5 grams of crack\n(as compared to 500 grams of powder) and its 10-year\nminimum to one convicted of possessing with intent to\ndistribute only 50 grams of crack (as compared to 5,000\ngrams of powder), thus producing a 100-to-1 crack-to-\npowder ratio. \u00a7\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii), (B)(iii) (2006 ed.).\n   The 1986 Drug Act, like other federal sentencing stat-\nutes, interacts with the Guidelines in an important way.\nLike other sentencing statutes, it trumps the Guidelines.\nThus, ordinarily no matter what the Guidelines provide, a\njudge cannot sentence an offender to a sentence beyond\nthe maximum contained in the federal statute setting\nforth the crime of conviction. Similarly, ordinarily no\nmatter what range the Guidelines set forth, a sentencing\njudge must sentence an offender to at least the minimum\nprison term set forth in a statutory mandatory minimum.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7994(a), (b)(1); USSG \u00a75G1.1; Neal v.\nUnited States, 516 U. S. 284, 289\u2013290, 295 (1996).\n   Not surprisingly, the Sentencing Commission incorpo-\nrated the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s mandatory minimums into the\nfirst version of the Guidelines themselves. Kimbrough,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupra, at 96\u201397. It did so by setting a base offense level\nfor a first-time drug offender that corresponded to the\nlowest Guidelines range above the applicable mandatory\nminimum. USSC, Report to the Congress: Mandatory\nMinimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice Sys-\ntem 53\u201354 (Oct. 2011) (2011 Report). Thus, the first\nGuidelines Drug Quantity Table associated 500 grams\nof powder cocaine with an offense level of 26, which for a\nfirst-time offender meant a sentencing range of 63 to 78\nmonths (just above the 5-year minimum), and it associated\n5,000 grams of powder cocaine with an offense level of 32,\nwhich for a first-time offender meant a sentencing range\nof 121 to 151 months (just above the 10-year minimum).\nUSSG \u00a72D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Further reflecting the 1986\nDrug Act\u2019s 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table asso-\nciated an offense level of 26 with 5 grams of crack and an\noffense level of 32 with 50 grams of crack. Ibid.\n   In addition, the Drug Quantity Table set offense levels\nfor small drug amounts that did not trigger the 1986 Drug\nAct\u2019s mandatory minimums so that the resulting Guide-\nlines sentences would remain proportionate to the sen-\ntences for amounts that did trigger these minimums. 2011\nReport 54. Thus, the Table associated 400 grams of pow-\nder cocaine (an amount that fell just below the amount\ntriggering the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 5-year minimum) with an\noffense level of 24, which for a first-time offender meant a\nsentencing range of 51 to 63 months (the range just below\nthe 5-year minimum). USSG \u00a72D1.1 (Oct. 1987). Follow-\ning the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio, the Table associated\nfour grams of crack (an amount that also fell just below\nthe amount triggering the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 5-year mini-\nmum) with an offense level of 24. Ibid.\n   The Commission did this not because it necessarily\nthought that those levels were most in keeping with past\nsentencing practice or would independently have reflected\na fair set of sentences, but rather because the Commission\n6                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieved that doing so was the best way to keep similar\ndrug-trafficking sentences proportional, thereby satisfying\nthe Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s basic \u201cproportionality\u201d objec-\ntive. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 97; USSG \u00a71A1.3 (Nov.\n2011); 2011 Report 53\u201354, 349, and n. 845. For this rea-\nson, the Commission derived the Drug Quantity Table\u2019s\nentire set of crack and powder cocaine offense levels by\nusing the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s two (5- and 10-year) minimum\namounts as reference points and then extrapolating from\nthose two amounts upward and downward to set propor-\ntional offense levels for other drug amounts. Ibid.\n                              B\n   During the next two decades, the Commission and\nothers in the law enforcement community strongly criti-\ncized Congress\u2019 decision to set the crack-to-powder manda-\ntory minimum ratio at 100-to-1. The Commission issued\nfour separate reports telling Congress that the ratio was\ntoo high and unjustified because, for example, research\nshowed the relative harm between crack and powder\ncocaine less severe than 100-to-1, because sentences em-\nbodying that ratio could not achieve the Sentencing Re-\nform Act\u2019s \u201cuniformity\u201d goal of treating like offenders\nalike, because they could not achieve the \u201cproportionality\u201d\ngoal of treating different offenders (e.g., major drug traf-\nfickers and low-level dealers) differently, and because the\npublic had come to understand sentences embodying the\n100-to-1 ratio as reflecting unjustified race-based differ-\nences. Kimbrough, supra, at 97\u201398; see, e.g., USSC,\nSpecial Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sen-\ntencing Policy 197\u2013198 (Feb. 1995) (1995 Report); USSC,\nSpecial Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentenc-\ning Policy 8 (Apr. 1997) (1997 Report); USSC, Report to\nCongress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 91, 103\n(May 2002) (2002 Report); USSC, Report to Congress:\nCocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007) (2007\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nReport). The Commission also asked Congress for new\nlegislation embodying a lower crack-to-powder ratio. 1995\nReport 198\u2013200; 1997 Report 9\u201310; 2002 Report 103\u2013\n107; 2007 Report 6\u20139. And the Commission recommended\nthat the legislation \u201cinclude\u201d an \u201cemergency amendment\u201d\nallowing \u201cthe Commission to incorporate the statutory\nchanges\u201d in the Guidelines while \u201cminimiz[ing] the lag\nbetween any statutory and guideline modifications for\ncocaine offenders.\u201d Id., at 9.\n   In 2010, Congress accepted the Commission\u2019s recom-\nmendations, see 2002 Report 104; 2007 Report 8\u20139, and\nn. 26, and enacted the Fair Sentencing Act into law. The\nAct increased the drug amounts triggering mandatory\nminimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to\n28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from 50\ngrams to 280 grams in respect to the 10-year minimum\n(while leaving powder at 500 grams and 5,000 grams\nrespectively). \u00a72(a), 124 Stat. 2372. The change had the\neffect of lowering the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18-\nto-1. (The Act also eliminated the 5-year mandatory\nminimum for simple possession of crack. \u00a73, 124 Stat.\n2372.)\n   Further, the Fair Sentencing Act instructed the Com-\nmission to \u201cmake such conforming amendments to the\nFederal sentencing guidelines as the Commission deter-\nmines necessary to achieve consistency with other guide-\nline provisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78(2), id., at 2374.\nAnd it directed the Commission to \u201cpromulgate the guide-\nlines, policy statements, or amendments provided for in\nthis Act as soon as practicable, and in any event not later\nthan 90 days\u201d after the new Act took effect. \u00a78(1), ibid.\n   The Fair Sentencing Act took effect on August 3,\n2010. The Commission promulgated conforming emergency\nGuidelines amendments that became effective on Novem-\nber 1, 2010. 75 Fed. Reg. 66188 (2010). A permanent\nversion of those Guidelines amendments took effect on\n8                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNovember 1, 2011. See 76 id., at 24960 (2011).\n                               C\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the relevant\nfacts of the cases before us. Corey Hill, one of the peti-\ntioners, unlawfully sold 53 grams of crack in March 2007,\nbefore the Fair Sentencing Act became law. App. in No.\n11\u20135721, pp. 6, 83 (hereinafter Hill App.). Under the 1986\nDrug Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of crack was\nsubject to a 10-year mandatory minimum. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2006 ed.). Hill was not sentenced, how-\never, until December 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act\nbecame law and after the new Guidelines amendments\nhad become effective. Hill App. 83\u201394. Under the Fair\nSentencing Act, an offender who sold 53 grams of\ncrack was subject to a 5-year, not a 10-year, minimum.\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The sentencing\njudge stated that, if he thought that the Fair Sentencing\nAct applied, he would have sentenced Hill to that Act\u2019s 5-\nyear minimum. Id., at 69. But he concluded that the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s lower minimums apply only to those who\ncommitted a drug crime after August 3, 2010\u2014the Act\u2019s\neffective date. Id., at 65, 68. That is to say, he concluded\nthat the new Act\u2019s more lenient sentences did not apply\nto those who committed a crime before August 3, even if\nthey were sentenced after that date. Hence, the judge sen-\ntenced Hill to 10 years of imprisonment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 417\nFed. Appx. 560 (2011).\n   The second petitioner, Edward Dorsey (who had previ-\nously been convicted of a drug felony), unlawfully sold 5.5\ngrams of crack in August 2008, before the Fair Sentencing\nAct took effect. App. in No. 5683, pp. 9, 48\u201349, 57\u201358\n(hereinafter Dorsey App.). Under the 1986 Drug Act, an\noffender such as Dorsey with a prior drug felony who sold\n5.5 grams of crack was subject to a 10-year minimum.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2006 ed.). Dorsey was not sentenced,\nhowever, until September 2010, after the new Fair Sen-\ntencing Act took effect. Id., at 84\u201395. Under the Fair\nSentencing Act, such an offender who sold 5.5 grams of\ncrack was not subject to a mandatory minimum at all, for\n5.5 grams is less than the 28 grams that triggers the new\nAct\u2019s mandatory minimum provisions. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)(iii)\n(2006 ed., Supp. IV). Dorsey asked the judge to apply the\nFair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient statutory penalties.\nId., at 54\u201355.\n  Moreover, as of Dorsey\u2019s sentencing in September 2010,\nthe unrevised Guidelines (reflecting the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s\nold minimums) were still in effect. The Commission had\nnot yet finished revising the Guidelines to reflect the\nnew, lower statutory minimums. And the basic sentencing\nstatute, the Sentencing Reform Act, provides that a judge\nshall apply the Guidelines that \u201care in effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\n  The sentencing judge, however, had the legal authority\nnot to apply the Guidelines at all (for they are advisory).\nBut he also knew that he could not ignore a minimum\nsentence contained in the applicable statute. Dorsey App.\n67\u201368. The judge noted that, even though he was sentenc-\ning Dorsey after the effective date of the Fair Sentencing\nAct, Dorsey had committed the underlying crime prior to\nthat date. Id., at 69\u201370. And he concluded that the 1986\nDrug Act\u2019s old minimums, not the new Fair Sentencing\nAct, applied in those circumstances. Ibid. He consequently\nsentenced Dorsey to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s 10-year man-\ndatory minimum term. Id., at 80. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Seventh Circuit affirmed, United States v. Fisher,\n635 F. 3d 336 (2011), and denied rehearing en banc, 646\nF. 3d 429 (2011) (per curiam); see also United States v.\nHolcomb, 657 F. 3d 445 (CA7 2011).\n  The Courts of Appeals have come to different conclu-\nsions as to whether the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient\n10               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmandatory minimums apply to offenders whose unlawful\nconduct took place before, but whose sentencing took place\nafter, the date that Act took effect, namely, August 3,\n2010. Compare United States v. Douglas, 644 F. 3d 39,\n42\u201344 (CA1 2011) (Act applies), and United States v.\nDixon, 648 F. 3d 195, 203 (CA3 2011) (same), with 635\nF. 3d, at 339\u2013340 (Act does not apply), United States v.\nSidney, 648 F. 3d 904, 910 (CA8 2011) (same), and\nUnited States v. Tickles, 661 F. 3d 212, 215 (CA5 2011)\n(per curiam) (same). In light of that disagreement, we\ngranted Hill\u2019s and Dorsey\u2019s petitions for certiorari. Since\npetitioners and the Government both take the position\nthat the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new minimums do apply\nin these circumstances, we appointed as amicus curiae\nMiguel Estrada to argue the contrary position. He has ably\ndischarged his responsibilities.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n  The timing issue before us is difficult in part because\nrelevant language in different statutes argues in opposite\ndirections. See Appendix A, infra. On the one hand, a\nfederal saving statute, Act of Feb. 25, 1871 (1871 Act), \u00a74,\n16 Stat. 432, phrased in general terms, provides that a\nnew criminal statute that \u201crepeal[s]\u201d an older criminal\nstatute shall not change the penalties \u201cincurred\u201d under\nthat older statute \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so ex-\npressly provide.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109. Case law makes clear\nthat the word \u201crepeal\u201d applies when a new statute simply\ndiminishes the penalties that the older statute set forth.\nSee Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 659\u2013664 (1974); see\nalso United States v. Tynen, </pre><span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"/scotus/sfv/united-states-v-tynen/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1871). Case\nlaw also makes clear that penalties are \u201cincurred\u201d under\nthe older statute when an offender becomes subject to\nthem, i.e., commits the underlying conduct that makes the\noffender liable. See United States v. Reisinger, 128 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n398, 401 (1888); Great Northern R. Co. v. United States,\n208 U. S. 452, 464\u2013470 (1908).\n   On the other hand, the Sentencing Reform Act says\nthat, regardless of when the offender\u2019s conduct occurs, the\napplicable Guidelines are the ones \u201cin effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\nAnd the Fair Sentencing Act requires the Commission\nto change the Guidelines in the wake of the Act\u2019s new\nminimums, making them consistent with \u201cother guideline\nprovisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78(2), 124 Stat. 2374.\n   Courts that have held that they must apply the old,\nhigher 1986 Drug Act minimums to all pre-Act offenders,\nincluding those sentenced after the Fair Sentencing Act\ntook effect, have emphasized that the 1871 Act requires\nthat result unless the Fair Sentencing Act either expressly\nsays or at least by fair implication implies the contrary.\nSee 635 F. 3d, at 339\u2013340; Sidney, supra, at 906\u2013908;\nTickles, supra, at 214\u2013215; see also Holcomb, supra, at\n446\u2013448 (opinion of Easterbrook, J.). Courts that have\nconcluded that the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient\npenalties apply have found in that Act, together with the\nSentencing Reform Act and other related circumstances,\nindicia of a clear congressional intent to apply the new\nAct\u2019s minimums. See Douglas, supra, at 42\u201344; Dixon,\nsupra, at 199\u2013203; see also Holcomb, 657 F. 3d, at 454\u2013\n457 (Williams, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en\nbanc); id., at 461\u2013463 (Posner, J., dissenting from denial\nof rehearing en banc). We too take the latter view. Six\nconsiderations, taken together, convince us that Congress\nintended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s more lenient penalties\nto apply to those offenders whose crimes preceded August\n3, 2010, but who are sentenced after that date.\n   First, the 1871 saving statute permits Congress to apply\na new Act\u2019s more lenient penalties to pre-Act offenders\nwithout expressly saying so in the new Act. It is true\nthat the 1871 Act uses the words \u201cexpressly provide.\u201d 1\n12               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a7109. But the Court has long recognized that this\nsaving statute creates what is in effect a less demanding\ninterpretive requirement. That is because statutes en-\nacted by one Congress cannot bind a later Congress,\nwhich remains free to repeal the earlier statute, to exempt\nthe current statute from the earlier statute, to modify the\nearlier statute, or to apply the earlier statute but as modi-\nfied. See, e.g., Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810);\nReichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U. S. 315, 318 (1932). And\nCongress remains free to express any such intention either\nexpressly or by implication as it chooses.\n   Thus, the Court has said that the 1871 Act \u201ccannot\njustify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested\neither expressly or by necessary implication in a subse-\nquent enactment.\u201d Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465\n(emphasis added). And in a comparable context the Court\nhas emphasized that the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s\nuse of the word \u201cexpressly\u201d does not require Congress to\nuse any \u201cmagical passwords\u201d to exempt a later statute\nfrom the provision. Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U. S. 302,\n310 (1955). Without requiring an \u201cexpress\u201d statement, the\nCourt has described the necessary indicia of congressional\nintent by the terms \u201cnecessary implication,\u201d \u201cclear impli-\ncation,\u201d and \u201cfair implication,\u201d phrases it has used inter-\nchangeably. Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465, 466;\nHertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 218 (1910); Marrero,\nsupra, at 660, n. 10. One Member of the Court has said\nwe should determine whether \u201cthe plain import of a later\nstatute directly conflicts with an earlier statute,\u201d and, if\nso, \u201cthe later enactment governs, regardless of its compli-\nance with any earlier-enacted requirement of an express\nreference or other \u2018magical password.\u2019 \u201d Lockhart v. United\nStates, 546 U. S. 142, 149 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring).\n   Hence, the Court has treated the 1871 Act as setting\nforth an important background principle of interpretation.\nThe Court has also assumed Congress is well aware of the\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbackground principle when it enacts new criminal stat-\nutes. E.g., Great Northern R. Co., supra, at 465; Hertz,\nsupra, at 217; cf. Marcello, supra, at 310. And the prin-\nciple requires courts, before interpreting a new criminal\nstatute to apply its new penalties to a set of pre-Act of-\nfenders, to assure themselves that ordinary interpretive\nconsiderations point clearly in that direction. Words such\nas \u201cplain import,\u201d \u201cfair implication,\u201d or the like reflect the\nneed for that assurance. And it is that assurance, which\nwe shall assume is conveyed by the phrases \u201cplain import\u201d\nor \u201cfair implication,\u201d that we must look for here.\n   Second, the Sentencing Reform Act sets forth a special\nand different background principle. That statute says that\nwhen \u201cdetermining the particular sentence to be imposed\u201d\nin an initial sentencing, the sentencing court \u201cshall con-\nsider,\u201d among other things, the \u201csentencing range\u201d estab-\nlished by the Guidelines that are \u201cin effect on the date\nthe defendant is sentenced.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii)\n(emphasis added). Although the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post\nFacto Clause, Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3, prohibits applying a new\nAct\u2019s higher penalties to pre-Act conduct, it does not pro-\nhibit applying lower penalties. See Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall.\n386, 390\u2013391 (1798); Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S.\n37, 41\u201344 (1990). The Sentencing Commission has conse-\nquently instructed sentencing judges to \u201cuse the Guide-\nlines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is\nsentenced,\u201d regardless of when the defendant committed\nthe offense, unless doing so \u201cwould violate the ex post facto\nclause.\u201d USSG \u00a71B1.11. And therefore when the Com-\nmission adopts new, lower Guidelines amendments, those\namendments become effective to offenders who committed\nan offense prior to the adoption of the new amendments\nbut are sentenced thereafter. Just as we assume Congress\nwas aware of the 1871 Act\u2019s background norm, so we\nassume that Congress was aware of this different back-\nground sentencing principle.\n14              DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Third, language in the Fair Sentencing Act implies\nthat Congress intended to follow the Sentencing Reform Act\nbackground principle here. A section of the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act entitled \u201cEmergency Authority for United States\nSentencing Commission\u201d requires the Commission to prom-\nulgate \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d (and not later than 90\ndays after August 3, 2010) \u201cconforming amendments\u201d to\nthe Guidelines that \u201cachieve consistency with other guide-\nline provisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78, 124 Stat. 2374.\nRead most naturally, \u201capplicable law\u201d refers to the law as\nchanged by the Fair Sentencing Act, including the provi-\nsion reducing the crack mandatory minimums. \u00a72(a),\nid., at 2372. As the Commission understood this provi-\nsion, achieving consistency with \u201cother guideline provi-\nsions\u201d means reducing the base offense levels for all crack\namounts proportionally (using the new 18-to-1 ratio), in-\ncluding the offense levels governing small amounts of\ncrack that did not fall within the scope of the mandatory\nminimum provisions. 75 Fed. Reg. 66191. And consis-\ntency with \u201cother guideline provisions\u201d and with prior Com-\nmission practice would require application of the new\nGuidelines amendments to offenders who committed their\noffense prior to the new amendments\u2019 effective date but\nwere sentenced thereafter. See USSG \u00a71B1.11(a); e.g.,\nUSSG App. C, amdts. 706, 711 (Supp. Nov. 2004\u2013Nov.\n2007); see also Memorandum from G. Schmitt, L. Reed, &\nK. Cohen, USSC, to Chair Hinojosa et al., Subject: Analy-\nsis of the Impact of the Crack Cocaine Amendment if\nMade Retroactive 23 (Oct. 3, 2007). Cf. USSG App. C,\namdt. 571 (amendment increasing restitution, which may\npresent ex post facto and one-book-rule concerns, would\napply only to defendants sentenced for post-amendment\noffenses), discussed post, at 5 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   Fourth, applying the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s old mandatory\nminimums to the post-August 3 sentencing of pre-August 3\noffenders would create disparities of a kind that Congress\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nenacted the Sentencing Reform Act and the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act to prevent. Two individuals with the same number\nof prior offenses who each engaged in the same criminal\nconduct involving the same amount of crack and were\nsentenced at the same time would receive radically differ-\nent sentences. For example, a first-time post-Act offender\nwith five grams of crack, subject to a Guidelines range of\n21 to 27 months, could receive two years of imprisonment,\nwhile an otherwise identical pre-Act offender would have\nto receive the 5-year mandatory minimum. Compare\nUSSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B)\n(2006 ed.). A first-time post-Act 50-gram offender would\nbe subject to a Guidelines range of less than six years of\nimprisonment, while his otherwise identical pre-Act coun-\nterpart would have to receive the 10-year mandatory\nminimum. Compare USSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011) with 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A) (2006 ed.).\n  Moreover, unlike many prechange/postchange discrep-\nancies, the imposition of these disparate sentences in-\nvolves roughly contemporaneous sentencing, i.e., the same\ntime, the same place, and even the same judge, thereby\nhighlighting a kind of unfairness that modern sentenc-\ning statutes typically seek to combat. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7991(b)(1)(B) (purposes of Guidelines-based sentencing\ninclude \u201cavoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities\namong defendants with similar records who have been\nfound guilty of similar criminal conduct\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98\u2013\n223, p. 74 (1983) (explaining rationale for using same,\ncurrent Guidelines for all roughly contemporaneous sen-\ntencings). Further, it would involve imposing upon the\npre-Act offender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Con-\ngress had specifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act\nthat such a sentence was unfairly long.\n  Finally, one cannot treat such problems as if they were\nminor ones. Given the 5-year statute of limitations for\nfederal drug offenses, the 11-month median time between\n16               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindictment and sentencing for those offenses, and the\napproximately 5,000 federal crack offenders convicted\neach year, many pre-Act offenders were not (and will not\nbe) sentenced until after August 3, 2010, when the new,\nmore lenient mandatory minimums took effect. See 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73282(a); Administrative Office of United States\nCourts, Judicial Business of the United States Courts,\np. 272 (2010) (Table D\u201310); 2011 Report 191.\n   Fifth, not to apply the Fair Sentencing Act would do\nmore than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would\nmake matters worse. It would create new anomalies\u2014new\nsets of disproportionate sentences\u2014not previously present.\nThat is because sentencing courts must apply new Guide-\nlines (consistent with the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new min-\nimums) to pre-Act offenders, see supra, at 13\u201314, and the\n1986 Drug Act\u2019s old minimums would trump those new\nGuidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of\nthem\u2014say, pre-Act offenders who possessed crack in small\namounts not directly the subject of mandatory minimums.\n   Consider, for example, a first-time offender convicted of\npossessing with intent to distribute four grams of crack.\nNo mandatory sentence, under the 1986 Drug Act or the\nFair Sentencing Act, applies to an offender possessing so\nsmall an amount. Yet under the old law, the Commission,\ncharged with creating proportionate sentences, had created\na Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months for such an of-\nfender, a sentence proportional to the 60 months that\nthe 1986 Drug Act required for one who trafficked five\ngrams of crack. See supra, at 5\u20136; USSG \u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov.\n2009).\n   The Fair Sentencing Act, however, requires the Com-\nmission to write new Guidelines consistent with the new\nlaw. The Commission therefore wrote new Guidelines that\nprovide a sentencing range of 21 to 27 months\u2014about\ntwo years\u2014for the first-time, 4-gram offender. See USSG\n\u00a72D1.1(c) (Nov. 2011). And the Sentencing Reform Act\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires application of those new Guidelines to all of-\nfenders (including pre-Act offenders) who are sentenced\nonce those new Guidelines take effect. See 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii). Those new Guidelines must take effect\nand apply to a pre-Act 4-gram offender, for such an of-\nfender was never subject to a trumping statutory 1986\nDrug Act mandatory minimum. However, unless the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s new, more lenient mandatory mini-\nmums apply to pre-Act offenders, an otherwise identical of-\nfender who possessed five grams would have to receive a\n5-year sentence. See 21 U. S. C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(B) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. IV).\n  For example, imagine that on July 1, 2010, both Smith\nand Jones commit a crack crime identical but for the fact\nthat Smith possesses with intent to distribute four grams\nof crack and Jones five grams. Both are sentenced on\nDecember 1, 2010, after the Fair Sentencing Act and the\nnew Guidelines take effect. Smith\u2019s Guidelines sentence\nwould be two years, but unless the Fair Sentencing Act\napplies, Jones\u2019s sentence would have to be five years. The\ndifference of one gram would make a difference, not of only\none year as it did before enactment of the Fair Sentencing\nAct, but instead of three years. Passage of the new Act,\ndesigned to have brought about fairer sentences, would\nhere have created a new disparate sentencing \u201ccliff.\u201d\n  Nor can one say that the new Act would produce dispro-\nportionalities like this in only a few cases. In fiscal year\n2010, 17.8 percent of all crack offenders were convicted of-\noffenses not subject to the 1986 Drug Act\u2019s minimums.\n2011 Report 191. And since those minimums apply only to\nsome drug offenders and they apply in different ways, one\ncan find many similar examples of disproportionalities.\nSee Appendix B, infra. Thus, application of the 1986 Drug\nAct minimums to pre-Act offenders sentenced after the\nnew Guidelines take effect would produce a crazy quilt of\nsentences, at odds with Congress\u2019 basic efforts to achieve\n18               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmore uniform, more proportionate sentences. Congress,\nwhen enacting the Fair Sentencing Act, could not have\nintended any such result.\n   Sixth, we have found no strong countervailing considera-\ntion. Amicus and the dissent argue that one might read\nmuch of the statutory language we have discussed as\nembodying exceptions, permitting the old 1986 Drug Act\nminimums to apply to pre-Act offenders sentenced after\nAugust 3, 2010, when the Fair Sentencing Act took effect.\nThe words \u201capplicable law\u201d in the new Act, for example,\ncould, linguistically speaking, encompass the 1986 Drug\nAct minimums applied to those sentenced after August 3.\nPost, at 4\u20136 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Moreover, Congress\ncould have insisted that the Commission write new Guide-\nlines with special speed to assure itself that new, post-\nAugust 3 offenders\u2014but not old, pre-August 3 offenders\u2014\nwould receive the benefit of the new Act. Post, at 6\u20138.\nFurther, amicus and the dissent note that to apply the\nnew Act\u2019s minimums to the old, pre-August 3 offenders\nwill create a new disparity\u2014one between pre-Act offenders\nsentenced before August 3 and those sentenced after that\ndate. Post, at 9.\n   We do not believe that these arguments make a critical\ndifference. Even if the relevant statutory language can\nbe read as amicus and the dissent suggest and even if\nCongress might have wanted Guidelines written speedily\nsimply in order to apply them quickly to new offenders,\nthere is scant indication that this is what Congress did\nmean by the language in question nor that such was in\nfact Congress\u2019 motivation. The considerations we have set\nforth, supra, at 13\u201317 and this page, strongly suggest the\ncontrary.\n   We also recognize that application of the new minimums\nto pre-Act offenders sentenced after August 3 will create\na new set of disparities. But those disparities, reflecting a\nline-drawing effort, will exist whenever Congress enacts a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnew law changing sentences (unless Congress intends re-\nopening sentencing proceedings concluded prior to a new\nlaw\u2019s effective date). We have explained how in federal\nsentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties\nto defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that\nchange from defendants already sentenced. Supra, at 13;\ncompare 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) with \u00a73582(c). And\nwe have explained how, here, continued application of\nthe old 1986 Drug Act minimums to those pre-Act offend-\ners sentenced after August 3 would make matters worse.\nSupra, at 16\u201318. We consequently conclude that this\nparticular new disparity (between those pre-Act offenders\nalready sentenced and those not yet sentenced as of\nAugust 3) cannot make a critical difference.\n  For these reasons considered as a whole, we conclude\nthat Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new,\nlower mandatory minimums to apply to the post-Act\nsentencing of pre-Act offenders. That is the Act\u2019s \u201cplain\nimport\u201d or \u201cfair implication.\u201d\n                              B\n  We add one final point. Several arguments we have\ndiscussed involve the language of statutes that determine\nhow new Guidelines take effect. Supra, at 13\u201314. What\nabout those who committed an offense prior to August 3\nand were sentenced after August 3 but before November 1,\n2010\u2014a period after the new Act\u2019s effective date but before\nthe new Guidelines first took effect? Do the Fair Sentenc-\ning Act\u2019s new mandatory minimums apply to them?\n  In our view, the new Act\u2019s lower minimums apply to\nthem as well. Our reason is that the statute simply in-\nstructs the Commission to promulgate new Guidelines \u201cas\nsoon as practicable\u201d (but no later than 90 days after the\nAct took effect). \u00a78(1), 124 Stat. 2374. As far as Congress\nwas concerned, the Commission might have (having\nprepared new Guidelines in advance) promulgated those\n20              DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGuidelines within a few days\u2014perhaps on August 3 itself.\nAt the same time, the Commission possesses ample au-\nthority to permit appropriate adjustments to be made in\nthe Guidelines sentences of those sentenced after August 3\nbut prior to the new Guidelines promulgation. See 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(u) (power to make Guidelines reductions\nretroactive); 76 Fed. Reg. 41333\u201341334 (2011) (amended\n18-to-1 Guidelines made retroactive).       In any event,\ncourts, treating the Guidelines as advisory, possess au-\nthority to sentence in accordance with the new minimums.\n  For these reasons, if the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new\nminimums apply to all of those sentenced after August 3,\n2010 (even if the new Guidelines were not yet ready), it is\npossible to foresee a reasonably smooth transition. On the\nother hand, it is difficult to foresee such a transition if\nthe new Act\u2019s application is keyed to a later date, thereby\nleaving the courts unable to take the new Act fully into\naccount, particularly when that circumstance might create\nadditional disparities and uncertainties that courts and\nthe Commission may be helpless to correct. We have no\nreason to believe Congress would have wanted to impose\nan unforeseeable, potentially complex application date.\n                       *    *    *\n  We vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgments and remand\nthese cases for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

For one\nthing, it would create sentencing \u201ccliffs\u201d at the 1986 Act\u2019s\nold triggering amounts of 5 grams and 50 grams (where\nthe old minimums would entirely trump the new Guide-\nlines), resulting in radically different Guidelines sentences\n24                DORSEY v.

For another, because of\nthose \u201ccliffs,\u201d the scheme would create similar Guidelines\nsentences for offenders who dealt in radically different\namounts of crack, e.g., 50 grams versus 500 grams.\n   To be sure, as amicus points out, Congress has provided\ntwo mechanisms through which an offender may escape\nan otherwise applicable mandatory minimum, diminishing\nthis problem for some offenders. First, an offender may\nescape a minimum by providing substantial assistance\nin the investigation or prosecution of another person. 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(e); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b); see also 28\nU. S. C. \u00a7994(n); USSG \u00a75K1.1. Second, under 18 U. S.

See also USSG \u00a75C1.2.\nAnd because of these mechanisms a substantial portion\nof first-time offenders are relieved of application of a manda-\ntory minimum. However, offenders with a criminal his-\ntory category of II or higher are ineligible for \u201csafety\nvalve\u201d relief; they escape application of a minimum at a\nmuch lower percentage.

The Act is silent\nas to whether these changes apply to defendants who\ncommitted their offenses before, but whose sentencing\nproceedings occurred after, its August 3, 2010, effective\ndate. In my view, the general saving statute, 1 U. S. C.\n\u00a7109, dictates that the new, more lenient mandatory\nminimum provisions do not apply to such pre-enactment\noffenders.\n                             I\n  The Court starts off on the right foot by acknowledging,\nante, at 10\u201311, that the ameliorative amendments at issue\n2                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhere trigger application of the general saving statute.\nEnacted in 1871 to reverse the common-law rule that the\nrepeal or amendment of a criminal statute would abate all\nnonfinal convictions under the repealed or amended stat-\nute, see Warden v. Marrero, 417 U. S. 653, 660 (1974), the\nsaving statute provides in relevant part:\n      \u201cThe repeal of any statute shall not have the effect\n    to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or lia-\n    bility incurred under such statute, unless the repeal-\n    ing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute\n    shall be treated as still remaining in force for the pur-\n    pose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for\n    the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liabil-\n    ity.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a7109.\nBy reducing the statutory penalties for crack cocaine\noffenses, the Fair Sentencing Act \u201crepeal[ed]\u201d the former\npenalties; for defendants who committed their offenses\n(and hence \u201cincurred\u201d the penalties) while the prior law\nwas in force, \u00a7109 directs that the prior law \u201cshall be\ntreated as still remaining in force.\u201d\n   Although \u00a7109 purports to require that subsequent\nlegislation opting out of its default rule must do so \u201cex-\npressly,\u201d the Court correctly observes, ante, at 12, that\nexpress-statement requirements of this sort are ineffec-\ntive. See Lockhart v. United States, 546 U. S. 142, 147\u2013\n150 (2005) (SCALIA, J., concurring). Because \u201cone legis-\nlature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding legisla-\nture,\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 135 (1810), a statute\nis \u201calterable when the legislature shall please to alter it,\u201d\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). Conse-\nquently, the express-statement requirement of \u00a7109 is\nitself subject to repeal on the same terms as any other\nstatute, which is to say that a repeal may be accomplished\nby implication. See, e.g., Marrero, supra, at 659\u2013660,\nn. 10; Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U. S.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n452, 465 (1908).\n  Understanding the interpretive problem posed by these\ncases as one of implied repeal helps to explain the Court\u2019s\nobservation, ante, at 13, that what is required to override\n\u00a7109\u2019s default rule is a clear demonstration of congres-\nsional intent to do so. Admittedly, our cases have not\nspoken with the utmost clarity on this point. In Marrero,\nfor example, we suggested that a \u201cfair implication\u201d from\na subsequently enacted statute would suffice, 417 U. S.,\nat 660, n. 10, while in Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205\n(1910), we used the phrase \u201cclear implication,\u201d id., at 218\n(emphasis added); see also ibid. (\u201cplain implication\u201d). In\nGreat Northern R. Co., we split the difference, stating at\none point that \u00a7109 controls unless Congress expresses a\ncontrary intention \u201ceither expressly or by necessary impli-\ncation in a subsequent enactment,\u201d 208 U. S., at 465 (em-\nphasis added), but suggesting at another point that a \u201cfair\nimplication,\u201d id., at 466, would do. In my view, the \u201cfair\nimplication\u201d formulation understates the burden properly\nimposed on a defendant who would claim an implicit\nexception from \u00a7109\u2019s terms. Because the effect of such\nan exception is to work a pro tanto repeal of \u00a7109\u2019s appli-\ncation to the defendant\u2019s case, the implication from the\nsubsequently enacted statute must be clear enough to\novercome our strong presumption against implied repeals.\nSee, e.g., Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein, 516\nU. S. 367, 381 (1996); Posadas v. National City Bank, 296\nU. S. 497, 503 (1936). Thus, we should conclude that\nCongress has deviated from \u00a7109 (or any similar statute\nestablishing a background interpretive principle) only\nwhen the \u201cplain import of a later statute directly conflicts\u201d\nwith it. Lockhart, supra, at 149 (SCALIA, J., concurring)\n(emphasis added).\n4                DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  The considerations relied upon by the Court do not come\nclose to satisfying the demanding standard for repeal by\nimplication. As an initial matter, there is no persuasive\nforce whatever to the Court\u2019s observation that continuing\nto apply the prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment\noffenders would \u201cinvolve imposing upon the pre-Act of-\nfender a pre-Act sentence at a time after Congress had\nspecifically found in the Fair Sentencing Act that such a\nsentence was unfairly long.\u201d Ante, at 15. That is true\nwhenever Congress reduces a criminal penalty, and so is a\nconsequence that Congress affirmatively embraced when it\nsaid in \u00a7109 that ameliorative amendments to criminal\nstatutes do not apply to pre-enactment conduct. Nor does\nit matter that Congress has instructed district courts,\nwhen applying the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, to ap-\nply the version in force on the date of sentencing, with\nthe object of reducing disparities in sentences between\nsimilar defendants who are sentenced for the same con-\nduct at the same time. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii).\nThe presumption against implied repeals requires us to\ngive effect, if possible, to both \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) and \u00a7109.\n\u201cThe courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among\ncongressional enactments, and when two statutes are ca-\npable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent\na clearly expressed congressional intention to the con-\ntrary, to regard each as effective.\u201d Morton v. Mancari, 417\nU. S. 535, 551 (1974). We may readily do so here by hold-\ning that \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii) applies to Guidelines amend-\nments, and \u00a7109 to statutory ones.\n  The Court also stresses that the Fair Sentencing Act\ninstructs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate \u201cas\nsoon as practicable\u201d (and not later than 90 days after\nAugust 3, 2010) \u201csuch conforming amendments\u201d to the\nSentencing Guidelines \u201cas the Commission determines\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnecessary to achieve consistency with other guideline\nprovisions and applicable law.\u201d \u00a78, 124 Stat. 2374. The\nargument goes that, because the Commission implemented\nthis directive by reducing the Guidelines ranges for\ncrack cocaine offenses to track the 18-to-1 crack-to-powder\nratio reflected in the new mandatory minimums, see 75\nFed. Reg. 66191 (2010), and because the general rule is\nthat a sentencing court should apply the version of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, see 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), Congress must have understood\nthat the new mandatory minimums would apply immedi-\nately, since otherwise there would be a mismatch between\nthe statutory penalties and Guidelines ranges.\n   That conclusion simply does not follow. For one thing,\nthe argument begs the very question presented here: What\nis the \u201capplicable law\u201d relevant to pre-enactment offenders\nwho are sentenced after enactment? The Commission\ncould well have answered this question by concluding that,\nin light of \u00a7109, the law applicable to such offenders is\nthe pre-Act mandatory minimums. It might therefore have\nretained, as to those offenders, the existing Guidelines\nranges reflecting a higher crack-to-powder ratio. Although\nrare, it is not unheard of for the Commission to establish\nGuidelines whose application turns on the date of commis-\nsion of the defendant\u2019s offense. See United States Sen-\ntencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a75E1.1(g)(1)\n(Nov. 2011) (governing restitution for offenses committed\non or after November 1, 1997, and providing that the prior\nversion of the Guideline shall govern all other cases); id.,\n\u00a78B1.1(f)(1) (same for restitution obligations of organiza-\ntional defendants). Of course, the Commission did not\ninterpret the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s directive in this man-\nner. But the possibility that it could (not to mention\nthe probability that it should) have done so illustrates the\nfolly of basing inferences about what Congress intended\nwhen it passed the Fair Sentencing Act on decisions the\n6                  DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nCommission would not make until several months later.1\n   Moreover, even if one takes it as given that the Com-\nmission\u2019s new crack cocaine Guidelines would apply the\nlower 18-to-1 ratio to all defendants sentenced after the\nnew Guidelines were put in place, it would not follow that\nCongress necessarily expected the new mandatory mini-\nmums to apply to pre-enactment offenders. The directive\nto update the Guidelines on an emergency basis is equally\nconsistent with Congress\u2019s seeking to avoid a mismatch\nbetween the Guidelines and the statutory penalties for\npost-enactment offenders sentenced shortly after the Act\u2019s\neffective date.\n   Petitioners and the Government discount this explana-\ntion, noting that because of the lags associated with in-\nvestigating and prosecuting drug offenses, most of the\ndefendants sentenced on the 91st day after the Fair\nSentencing Act\u2019s enactment were sure to be pre-Act of-\nfenders. If Congress did not expect the new mandatory\nminimums to apply to such offenders, they say, there\nwould have been no need to ensure that revised Guidelines\nwere in place so quickly. But most is not all, and it would\nhave been entirely sensible for Congress to worry that\nsome post-Act offenders\u2014offenders clearly subject to the\nnew mandatory minimums\u2014would nonetheless be sen-\ntenced under outdated Guidelines if the Guidelines were\nnot revised in short order.\n   The 11-month median time between indictment and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Congressional reliance on future Commission action might be plau-\n\nsible if the Commission had a settled practice of tying reductions in\nstatutory mandatory minimums to immediately applicable reductions\nin Guidelines ranges, without any distinction based on the timing of\nthe defendant\u2019s offense. But the Court does not cite any such settled\npractice, and I am not aware of any. Presumably there has been no\noccasion for a practice to develop either way, since congressional\nlegislation reducing criminal penalties is, in this day and age, very\nrare.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Because that is a median figure, it shows\nthat half of all drug defendants are sentenced sooner\nthan 11 months after being indicted. And it is only an\naggregate figure. For drug possession offenses\u2014relevant\nhere because the Fair Sentencing Act eliminated the\nmandatory minimum sentence previously applicable to\nsimple possession of crack cocaine, see \u00a73, 124 Stat.\n2372\u2014the equivalent figure was just 5.4 months from\nindictment to sentencing. The pace of criminal cases also\nvaries considerably from district to district. In the East-\nern District of Virginia, for instance, the median time from\nindictment to sentencing for all criminal cases was just 3.6\nmonths. See Judicial Business, supra, at 252 (Table D\u20136).\nWhat is more, without the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s emer-\ngency directive, amendments to the Guidelines to implement\nthe Act likely would not have been put in place until more\nthan a year after its passage.2 In the interim, a great\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 In the ordinary course, the Commission may submit proposed\n\nGuidelines amendments to Congress \u201cat or after the beginning of a\nregular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May.\u201d 28\nU.

See United States Sentencing Commission,\nRules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 4.1 (amended Aug. 2007).\nBecause the Fair Sentencing Act was enacted on August 3, 2010\u2014after\nMay 1\u2014there would have been no opportunity for the Commission to\nsubmit proposed amendments to Congress until January 2011. Given\nthe 180-day waiting period, the amendments could not have gone into\nforce until the very end of June 2011 at the earliest. And in all likeli-\n8                   DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmany post-Act offenders might have been sentenced under\nthe outdated Guidelines, even though they were clearly\nentitled to take advantage of the statutory amendments.\nBecause the emergency authority conferred on the Com-\nmission can reasonably be understood as directed at this\nmismatch problem, it creates no clear implication that\nCongress expected the new statutory penalties to apply to\npre-enactment offenders.\n  The Court\u2019s last argument is that continuing to apply\nthe prior mandatory minimums to pre-enactment offend-\ners would lead to anomalous, disproportionate sentencing\nresults. It is true enough, as the Court notes, ante, at 16\u2013\n18, that applying the prior mandatory minimums in tan-\ndem with the new Guidelines provisions\u2014which track the\nnew, more lenient mandatory minimums\u2014leads to a\nseries of \u201ccliffs\u201d at the mandatory minimum thresholds.\nBut this does not establish that Congress clearly meant\nthe new mandatory minimums to apply to pre-enactment\noffenders. As noted above, supra, at 5\u20136, there is no rea-\nson to take the Guidelines amendments ultimately prom-\nulgated by the Commission as a given when evaluating\nwhat Congress would have understood when the Fair\nSentencing Act was enacted. The Commission could have\npromulgated amendments that ameliorated this problem\nby retaining the old Guidelines ranges for pre-enactment\noffenders.\n  Moreover, although the cliffs produced by the mismatch\nbetween Guidelines and statutory penalties are admittedly\ninconsistent with the premise of the Guidelines system\nthat sentences should vary in proportion to the gravity\nof the offense and the culpability of the offender, see 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), the same objection can be\nlodged against any mandatory minimum that trumps an\notherwise applicable Guidelines range. And it is not as\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nhood, they would not have been effective until November 1, 2011.\n\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthough the results of continuing to apply the pre-Act\nstatutory penalties are so senseless as to establish that\nCongress must not have intended them. Retaining the old\nmandatory minimums ensures at least rough equivalence\nin sentences for defendants who committed their crimes at\nthe same time, but were sentenced at different times\u2014\neven as it leads to disparities for defendants who are sen-\ntenced at the same time, but committed their offenses\nat different times. In light of this plausible basis for con-\ntinuing to apply the prior law to pre-enactment offenders,\nthere is no reason to conclude that Congress necessarily\nexpected the new statutory penalties to apply.\n                             B\n  Petitioners and the Government press a handful of ad-\nditional arguments which require only brief discussion.\nThey first contend that an intention to apply the new\nmandatory minimums to pre-enactment offenders can be\ninferred from \u00a710 of the Fair Sentencing Act, 124 Stat.\n2375, which instructs the Commission to study the effects\nof the new law and make a report to Congress within five\nyears. The suggestion is that, if the statutory penalties do\nnot apply to pre-enactment offenders, then the Act would\nhave no effect on many defendants sentenced during\nthe study period, which would in turn undermine Con-\ngress\u2019s goal of compiling useful data. This is makeweight.\nWhether or not the new mandatory minimums are held\napplicable to pre-enactment offenders, they will be applied\nto many post-enactment offenders during the study period,\nand the Commission will have the opportunity to collect\nuseful data. The study provision simply has nothing to\nsay about the question at issue here.\n  The Government also notes that the Senate bill that\nultimately became the Fair Sentencing Act was based on\nan earlier bill which contained a provision that would\nhave delayed the Act\u2019s effective date until 180 days after\n10               DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\npassage, and specifically provided that \u201c[t]here shall be no\nretroactive application of any portion of this Act.\u201d H. R.\n265, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a711 (2009). Even if one is\ninclined to base inferences about statutory meaning on\nunenacted versions of the relevant bill, but see Hamdan v.\nRumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 668 (2006) (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning), this argument from drafting history is unpersuasive.\nThat Congress considered and rejected a proposal that\nwould have delayed application of the Act until 180 days\nafter passage says nothing about whether the version\nfinally enacted applies to defendants whose criminal con-\nduct pre-dated the Act. Moreover, the same bill would\nhave provided permissive authority for the Commission to\npromulgate amended Guidelines on an emergency basis,\nsee \u00a78(a), notwithstanding its delayed effective date provi-\nsion. This point undercuts the argument that emergency\namendment authority and immediate application of the\nnew statutory penalties go hand-in-hand.\n   Petitioners finally appeal to the rule of lenity and the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance. But the rule of lenity\nhas no application here, because the background principle\nsupplied by \u00a7109 serves to remove the ambiguity that is a\nnecessary precondition to invocation of the rule. See Deal\nv. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 135 (1993). The canon\nof constitutional avoidance also has no application here.\nAlthough many observers viewed the 100-to-1 crack-to-\npowder ratio under the prior law as having a racially\ndisparate impact, see, e.g., United States Sentencing\nCommission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and\nFederal Sentencing Policy 8 (Apr. 1997), only intentional\ndiscrimination may violate the equal protection component\nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. See Ar\u00ad\nlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development\nCorp., 429 U. S. 252, 264\u2013265 (1977); Adarand Construc\u00ad\ntors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 217 (1995). There is thus\nno constitutional doubt triggered by application of the\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            11\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nprior mandatory minimums, much less the sort of \u201cserious\nconstitutional doub[t]\u201d required to invoke the avoidance\ncanon. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\n                          *    *     *\n   In the end, the mischief of the Court\u2019s opinion is not the\nresult in this particular case, but rather the unpredictabil-\nity it injects into the law for the future. The Court\u2019s de-\ncision is based on \u201c[s]ix considerations, taken together,\u201d\nante, at 11, and we are not told whether any one of these\nconsiderations might have justified the Court\u2019s result in\nisolation, or even the relative importance of the various\nconsiderations. One of them (the Commission\u2019s emergency\nauthority to issue conforming amendments to the Guide-\nlines) is a particular feature of the statute at issue in these\ncases, but another (the fact that applying the prior statu-\ntory penalties alongside the new Guidelines leads to a\nmismatch) is a general feature of a sentencing scheme\nthat calibrates Guidelines ranges to the statutory manda-\ntory minimums for a given offense. Are we to conclude\nthat, after the Sentencing Reform Act, \u00a7109 has no further\napplication to criminal penalties, at least when statutory\namendments lead to modification of the Guidelines? Por-\ntions of the Court\u2019s opinion could be understood to sug-\ngest that result, but the Court leaves us in suspense.\n   That is most unfortunate, because the whole point of\n\u00a7109, as well as other provisions of the Dictionary Act, see\n1 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71\u20138, and the definitional provisions of the\nfederal criminal law, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a75\u201327 (2006 ed. and\nSupp. IV), is to provide a stable set of background princi-\nples that will promote effective communication between\nCongress and the courts. In this context, stability is en-\nsured by a healthy respect for our presumption against\nimplied repeals, which demands a clear showing before we\nconclude that Congress has deviated from one of these\nbackground interpretive principles. Because the Court\u2019s\n12              DORSEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nresult cannot be reconciled with this approach, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n</pre>",
