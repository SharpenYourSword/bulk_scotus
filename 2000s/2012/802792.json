Argued January 10, 2012\u2014Decided June 21, 2012*\nTitle 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 bans the broadcast of \u201cany obscene, indecent, or\n   profane language.\u201d       The Federal Communications Commission\n   (Commission) began enforcing \u00a71464 in the 1970\u2019s. In FCC v. Pacif-\n   ica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, this Court found that the Commission\u2019s\n   order banning George Carlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue passed\n   First Amendment scrutiny, but did not decide whether \u201can occasional\n   expletive . . . would justify any sanction,\u201d id., at 750. In the ensuing\n   years, the Commission went from strictly observing the narrow cir-\n   cumstances of Pacifica to indicating that it would assess the full con-\n   text of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than limit its regulation\n   to an index of indecent words or pictures. However, it continued to\n   note the important difference between isolated and repeated broad-\n   casts of indecent material. And in a 2001 policy statement, it even\n   included, as one of the factors significant to the determination of\n   what was patently offensive, \u201cwhether the material dwells on or re-\n   peats at length\u201d the offending description or depiction.\n      It was against this regulatory background that the three incidents\n   at issue took place. Two concern isolated utterances of obscene words\n   during two live broadcasts aired by respondent Fox Television Sta-\n   tions, Inc. The third occurred during an episode of a television show\n   broadcast by respondent ABC Television Network, when the nude\n   buttocks of an adult female character were shown for approximately\n   seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment. After these\n   incidents, but before the Commission issued Notices of Apparent Lia-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with Federal Communications Commission v. ABC, Inc.,\net al. (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4), also on certiorari to the same court.\n2              FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    bility to Fox and ABC, the Commission issued its Golden Globes Or-\n    der, declaring for the first time that fleeting expletives could be ac-\n    tionable. It then concluded that the Fox and ABC broadcasts violated\n    this new standard. It found the Fox broadcasts indecent, but de-\n    clined to propose forfeitures. The Second Circuit reversed, finding\n    the Commission\u2019s decision to modify its indecency enforcement re-\n    gime to regulate fleeting expletives arbitrary and capricious. This\n    Court reversed and remanded for the Second Circuit to address re-\n    spondents\u2019 First Amendment challenges. FCC v. Fox Television Sta-\n    tions, Inc., 556 U. S. 502. On remand, the Second Circuit found the\n    policy unconstitutionally vague and invalidated it in its entirety. In\n    the ABC case, the Commission found the display actionably indecent,\n    and imposed a $27,500 forfeiture on each of the 45 ABC-affiliated\n    stations that aired the episode. The Second Circuit vacated the order\n    in light of its Fox decision.\nHeld: Because the Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice\n prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and mo-\n mentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the Commission\u2019s\n standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague. Pp. 11\u201318.\n    (a) The fundamental principle that laws regulating persons or enti-\n ties must give fair notice of what conduct is required or proscribed,\n see, e.g., Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391, is essen-\n tial to the protections provided by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\n cess Clause, see United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304, which\n requires the invalidation of impermissibly vague laws. A conviction\n or punishment fails to comply with due process if the statute or regu-\n lation under which it is obtained \u201cfails to provide a person of ordinary\n intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless\n that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforce-\n ment.\u201d Ibid. The void for vagueness doctrine addresses at least two\n connected but discrete due process concerns: Regulated parties\n should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly;\n and precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the\n law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. When speech is\n involved, rigorous adherence to those requirements is necessary to\n ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech. Pp. 11\u201312.\n    (b) These concerns are implicated here, where the broadcasters\n claim that the lengthy procedural history of their cases shows that\n they did not have fair notice of what was forbidden. Under the 2001\n Guidelines in force when the broadcasts occurred, a key consideration\n was \u201cwhether the material dwell[ed] on or repeat[ed] at length\u201d the\n offending description or depiction, but in the 2004 Golden Globes Or-\n der, issued after the broadcasts, the Commission changed course and\n held that fleeting expletives could be a statutory violation. It then\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  applied this new principle to these cases. Its lack of notice to Fox and\n  ABC of its changed interpretation failed to give them \u201cfair notice of\n  what is prohibited.\u201d Williams, supra, at 304. Pp. 12\u201313.\n     (c) Neither of the Government\u2019s contrary arguments is persuasive.\n  It claims that Fox cannot establish unconstitutional vagueness be-\n  cause the Commission declined to impose a forfeiture on Fox and said\n  that it would not consider the indecent broadcast in renewing station\n  licenses or in other contexts. But the Commission has the statutory\n  power to take into account \u201cany history of prior offenses\u201d when set-\n  ting a forfeiture penalty, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7503(b)(2)(E), and the due pro-\n  cess protection against vague regulations \u201cdoes not leave [regulated\n  parties] . . . at the mercy of noblesse oblige.\u201d United States v. Stevens,\n  559 U. S. ___, ___. The challenged orders could also have an adverse\n  impact on Fox\u2019s reputation with audiences and advertisers alike.\n     The Government argues that ABC had notice that its broadcast\n  would be considered indecent. But an isolated statement in a 1960\n  Commission decision declaring that televising nudes might be con-\n  trary to \u00a71464 does not suffice for the fair notice required when the\n  Government intends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly\n  impermissible speech. Moreover, previous Commission decisions had\n  declined to find isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably inde-\n  cent. In light of these agency decisions, and the absence of any notice\n  in the 2001 Guidance that seven seconds of nude buttocks would be\n  found indecent, ABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to\n  being sanctioned. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     (d) It is necessary to make three observations about this decision\u2019s\n  scope. First, because the Court resolves these cases on fair notice\n  grounds under the Due Process Clause, it need not address the First\n  Amendment implications of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy or re-\n  consider Pacifica at this time. Second, because the Court rules that\n  Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their broadcasts that their\n  material could be found actionably indecent under then-existing poli-\n  cies, the Court need not address the constitutionality of the current\n  indecency policy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and subse-\n  quent adjudications. Third, this opinion leaves the Commission free\n  to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of\n  the public interest and applicable legal requirements and leaves\n  courts free to review the current, or any modified, policy in light of its\n  content and application.

Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,\n529 (2009) (Fox I), the Court held that the Federal Com\u00ad\nmunication Commission\u2019s decision to modify its indecency\nenforcement regime to regulate so-called fleeting exple\u00ad\ntives was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The Court\nthen declined to address the constitutionality of the policy,\nhowever, because the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit had yet to do so. On remand, the Court\nof Appeals found the policy was vague and, as a result,\nunconstitutional. 613 F. 3d 317 (2010). The case now\nreturns to this Court for decision upon the constitutional\nquestion.\n                          I\n  In Fox I, the Court described both the regulatory\nframework through which the Commission regulates\nbroadcast indecency and the long procedural history of\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis case. The Court need not repeat all that history, but\nsome preliminary discussion is necessary to understand\nthe constitutional issue the case now presents.\n                             A\n   Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 provides that \u201c[w]hoever utters\nany obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of\nradio communication shall be fined . . . or imprisoned not\nmore than two years, or both.\u201d The Federal Communi\u00ad\ncations Commission (Commission) has been instructed by\nCongress to enforce \u00a71464 between the hours of 6 a.m.\nand 10 p.m., see Public Telecommunications Act of 1992,\n\u00a715(a), 106 Stat. 954, note following 47 U. S. C. \u00a7303,\np. 113 (Broadcasting of Indecent Programming). And the\nCommission has applied its regulations to radio and tele\u00ad\nvision broadcasters alike, see Fox I, supra, at 505\u2013506;\nsee also 47 CFR \u00a773.3999 (2010) (Commission regulation\nprohibiting the broadcast of any obscene material or any\nindecent material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.). Although\nthe Commission has had the authority to regulate inde\u00ad\ncent broadcasts under \u00a71464 since 1948 (and its prede\u00ad\ncessor commission, the Federal Radio Commission, since\n1927), it did not begin to enforce \u00a71464 until the 1970\u2019s.\nSee Campbell, Pacifica Reconsidered: Implications for the\nCurrent Controversy over Broadcast Indecency, 63 Fed.\nCom. L. J. 195, 198 (2010).\n   This Court first reviewed the Commission\u2019s indecency\npolicy in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978).\nIn Pacifica, the Commission determined that George\nCarlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue was indecent. It con\u00ad\ntained \u201c \u2018language that describes, in terms patently offen\u00ad\nsive as measured by contemporary community standards\nfor the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities\nand organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable\nrisk that children may be in the audience.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 732\n(quoting 56 F. C. C. 2d 94, 98 (1975)). This Court upheld\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Commission\u2019s ruling. The broadcaster\u2019s statutory\nchallenge was rejected. The Court held the Commission\nwas not engaged in impermissible censorship within the\nmeaning of 47 U. S. C. \u00a7326 (1976 ed.), see 438 U. S., at\n735\u2013739, and that \u00a71464\u2019s definition of indecency was not\nconfined to speech with an appeal to the prurient interest,\nsee id., at 738\u2013741. Finding no First Amendment viola\u00ad\ntion, the decision explained the constitutional standard\nunder which regulations of broadcasters are assessed. It\nobserved that \u201cbroadcast media have established a uniquely\npervasive presence in the lives of all Americans,\u201d id., at\n748, and that \u201cbroadcasting is uniquely accessible to chil\u00ad\ndren, even those too young to read,\u201d id., at 749. In light\nof these considerations, \u201cbroadcasting . . . has received the\nmost limited First Amendment protection.\u201d Id., at 748.\nUnder this standard the Commission\u2019s order passed con\u00ad\nstitutional scrutiny. The Court did note the narrowness of\nits holding, explaining that it was not deciding whether\n\u201can occasional expletive . . . would justify any sanction.\u201d\nId., at 750; see also id., at 760\u2013761 (Powell, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201c[C]ertainly the\nCourt\u2019s holding . . . does not speak to cases involving the\nisolated use of a potentially offensive word in the course of\na radio broadcast, as distinguished from the verbal shock\ntreatment administered by respondent here\u201d).\n   From 1978 to 1987, the Commission did not go beyond\nthe narrow circumstances of Pacifica and brought no\nindecency enforcement actions. See In re Infinity Broad-\ncasting Corp., 3 FCC Rcd. 930 (1987); see also In re Appli-\ncation of WGBH Educ. Foundation, 69 F. C. C. 2d 1250,\n1254 (1978) (Commission declaring it \u201cintend[s] strictly to\nobserve the narrowness of the Pacifica holding\u201d). Recog\u00ad\nnizing that Pacifica provided \u201cno general prerogative to\nintervene in any case where words similar or identical to\nthose in Pacifica are broadcast over a licensed radio or\ntelevision station,\u201d the Commission distinguished between\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe \u201crepetitive occurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words\u201d (such as\nin the Carlin monologue) and an \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201coccasional\u201d\nexpletive, that would not necessarily be actionable. 69\nF. C. C. 2d, at 1254.\n   In 1987, the Commission determined it was applying the\nPacifica standard in too narrow a way. It stated that in\nlater cases its definition of indecent language would \u201cap\u00ad\npropriately includ[e] a broader range of material than the\nseven specific words at issue in [the Carlin monologue].\u201d\nIn re Pacifica Foundation Inc., 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699.\nThus, the Commission indicated it would use the \u201cgeneric\ndefinition of indecency\u201d articulated in its 1975 Pacifica\norder, Infinity Order, 3 FCC Rcd., at 930, and assess the\nfull context of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than\nlimiting its regulation to a \u201ccomprehensive index . . . of\nindecent words or pictorial depictions,\u201d id., at 932.\n   Even under this context based approach, the Commis\u00ad\nsion continued to note the important difference between\nisolated and repeated broadcasts of indecent material. See\nibid. (considering variables in determining whether mate\u00ad\nrial is patently offensive including \u201cwhether allegedly\noffensive material is isolated or fleeting\u201d). In the context\nof expletives, the Commission determined \u201cdeliberate and\nrepetitive use in a patently offensive manner is a requisite\nto a finding of indecency.\u201d Pacifica Order, 2 FCC Rcd., at\n2699. For speech \u201cinvolving the description or depiction\nof sexual or excretory functions . . . [t]he mere fact that\nspecific words or phrases are not repeated does not man\u00ad\ndate a finding that material that is otherwise patently\noffensive . . . is not indecent.\u201d Ibid.\n   In 2001, the Commission issued a policy statement\nintended \u201cto provide guidance to the broadcast industry\nregarding [its] caselaw interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 and\n[its] enforcement policies with respect to broadcast inde\u00ad\ncency.\u201d In re Industry Guidance on Commission\u2019s Case\nLaw Interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 and Enforcement\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPolicies Regarding Broadcast Indecency, 16 FCC Rcd.\n7999. In that document the Commission restated that for\nmaterial to be indecent it must depict sexual or excretory\norgans or activities and be patently offensive as measured\nby contemporary community standards for the broadcast\nmedium. Id., at 8002. Describing the framework of what\nit considered patently offensive, the Commission explained\nthat three factors had proved significant:\n    \u201c(1) [T]he explicitness or graphic nature of the de\u00ad\n    scription or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or\n    activities; (2) whether the material dwells on or re\u00ad\n    peats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory or\u00ad\n    gans or activities; (3) whether the material appears to\n    pander or is used to titillate, or whether the material\n    appears to have been presented for its shock value.\u201d\n    Id., at 8003 (emphasis deleted).\nAs regards the second of these factors, the Commission\nexplained that \u201c[r]epetition of and persistent focus on\nsexual or excretory material have been cited consistently\nas factors that exacerbate the potential offensiveness of\nbroadcasts. In contrast, where sexual or excretory refer\u00ad\nences have been made once or have been passing or fleet\u00ad\ning in nature, this characteristic has tended to weigh\nagainst a finding of indecency.\u201d Id., at 8008. The Com\u00ad\nmission then gave examples of material that was not\nfound indecent because it was fleeting and isolated, id., at\n8008\u20138009 (citing, e.g., L. M. Communications of South\nCarolina, Inc. (WYBB(FM)), 7 FCC Rcd. 1595 (MMB 1992)\n(finding \u201ca fleeting and isolated utterance\u201d in the context\nof live and spontaneous programming not actionable)), and\ncontrasted it with fleeting references that were found\npatently offensive in light of other factors, 16 FCC Rcd., at\n8009 (citing, e.g., Tempe Radio, Inc. (KUPD\u2013FM), 12 FCC\nRcd. 21828 (MMB 1997) (finding fleeting language that\nclearly refers to sexual activity with a child to be patently\n6              FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\noffensive)).\n                              B\n   It was against this regulatory background that the three\nincidents of alleged indecency at issue here took place.\nFirst, in the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, broadcast by\nrespondent Fox Television Stations, Inc., the singer Cher\nexclaimed during an unscripted acceptance speech: \u201cI\u2019ve\nalso had my critics for the last 40 years saying that I was\non my way out every year. Right. So f *** \u2018em.\u201d 613 F. 3d,\nat 323. Second, Fox broadcast the Billboard Music Awards\nagain in 2003. There, a person named Nicole Richie\nmade the following unscripted remark while presenting an\naward: \u201cHave you ever tried to get cow s*** out of a Prada\npurse? It\u2019s not so f ***ing simple.\u201d Ibid. The third in\u00ad\ncident involved an episode of NYPD Blue, a regular tele\u00ad\nvision show broadcast by respondent ABC Television\nNetwork. The episode broadcast on February 25, 2003,\nshowed the nude buttocks of an adult female character for\napproximately seven seconds and for a moment the side\nof her breast. During the scene, in which the character\nwas preparing to take a shower, a child portraying her boy\u00ad\nfriend\u2019s son entered the bathroom. A moment of awk\u00ad\nwardness followed. 404 Fed. Appx. 530, 533\u2013534 (CA2\n2011). The Commission received indecency complaints\nabout all three broadcasts. See Fox I, 556 U. S., at 510;\n404 Fed. Appx., at 534.\n   After these incidents, but before the Commission issued\nNotices of Apparent Liability to Fox and ABC, the Com\u00ad\nmission issued a decision sanctioning NBC for a comment\nmade by the singer Bono during the 2003 Golden Globe\nAwards. Upon winning the award for Best Original Song,\nBono exclaimed: \u201c \u2018This is really, really, f ***ing brilliant.\nReally, really great.\u2019 \u201d In re Complaints Against Various\nBroadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden\nGlobe Awards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4976, n. 4\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2004) (Golden Globes Order). Reversing a decision by its\nenforcement bureau, the Commission found the use of\nthe F-word actionably indecent. Id., at 4975\u20134976. The\nCommission held that the word was \u201cone of the most vul\u00ad\ngar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity\nin the English language,\u201d and thus found \u201cany use of that\nword or a variation, in any context, inherently has a sex\u00ad\nual connotation.\u201d Id., at 4978\u20134979. Turning to the iso\u00ad\nlated nature of the expletive, the Commission reversed prior\nrulings that had found fleeting expletives not indecent.\nThe Commission held \u201cthe mere fact that specific words or\nphrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a\nfinding that material that is otherwise patently offensive\nto the broadcast medium is not indecent.\u201d Id., at 4980; see\nalso id., at 4982 (\u201cJust as the Court [in Pacifica] held\nthat . . . the George Carlin routine \u2018could have enlarged\na child\u2019s vocabulary in an instant,\u2019 we believe that even\nisolated broadcasts of the \u2018F-Word\u2019 in situations such as\nthat here could do so as well\u201d).\n                            C\n   Even though the incidents at issue in these cases took\nplace before the Golden Globes Order, the Commission\napplied its new policy regarding fleeting expletives and\nfleeting nudity. It found the broadcasts by respondents\nFox and ABC to be in violation of this standard.\n                            1\n  As to Fox, the Commission found the two Billboard\nAwards broadcasts indecent in In re Complaints Regard-\ning Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2,\n2002, and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 2664 (2006). Nu\u00ad\nmerous parties petitioned for a review of the order in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nThe Court of Appeals granted the Commission\u2019s request\nfor a voluntary remand so that it could respond to the\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparties\u2019 objections. Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC,\n489 F. 3d 444, 453 (2007). In its remand order, the Com\u00ad\nmission applied its tripartite definition of patently offen\u00ad\nsive material from its 2001 Order and found that both\nbroadcasts fell well within its scope. See In re Complaints\nRegarding Various Television Broadcasts Between Febru-\nary 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006)\n(Remand Order); see also Fox I, supra, at 511\u2013513 (dis\u00ad\ncussing in detail the Commission\u2019s findings). As pertains\nto the constitutional issue in these cases, the Commission\nnoted that under the policy clarified in the Golden Globes\nOrder, \u201ccategorically requiring repeated use of expletives\nin order to find material indecent is inconsistent with\nour general approach to indecency enforcement.\u201d Remand\nOrder, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308; see also id., at 13325\n(\u201c[U]nder our Golden Globe precedent, the fact that Cher\nused the \u2018F-word\u2019 once does not remove her comment from\nthe realm of actionable indecency\u201d). Though the Commis\u00ad\nsion deemed Fox should have known Nicole Richie\u2019s com\u00ad\nments were actionably indecent even prior to the Golden\nGlobes Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, it declined to pro\u00ad\npose a forfeiture in light of the limited nature of the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit\u2019s remand. Id., at 13321. The Commission\nacknowledged that \u201cit was not apparent that Fox could be\npenalized for Cher\u2019s comment at the time it was broad\u00ad\ncast.\u201d And so, as in the Golden Globes case it imposed no\npenalty for that broadcast. Id., at 13324, 13326.\n   Fox and various intervenors returned to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, raising ad\u00ad\nministrative, statutory, and constitutional challenges to\nthe Commission\u2019s indecency regulations. See Fox Televi-\nsion Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 489 F. 3d 444. In a 2-to-1 deci\u00ad\nsion, with Judge Leval dissenting, the Court of Appeals\nfound the Remand Order arbitrary and capricious because\n\u201cthe FCC has made a 180-degree turn regarding its treat\u00ad\nment of \u2018fleeting expletives\u2019 without providing a reasoned\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation justifying the about-face.\u201d 489 F. 3d, at 455.\nWhile noting its skepticism as to whether the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s fleeting expletive regime \u201cwould pass constitutional\nmuster,\u201d the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to ad\u00ad\ndress the issue. Id., at 462.\n   The case came here on certiorari. Citing the Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551 et seq., this Court\nnoted that the Judiciary may set aside agency action that\nis arbitrary or capricious. In the context of a change in\npolicy (such as the Commission\u2019s determination that fleet\u00ad\ning expletives could be indecent), the decision held an\nagency, in the ordinary course, should acknowledge that it\nis in fact changing its position and \u201cshow that there are\ngood reasons for the new policy.\u201d Fox I, 553 U. S., at 515.\nThere is no need, however, for an agency to provide de\u00ad\ntailed justifications for every change or to show that the\nreasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for\nthe old one. Ibid.\n   Judged under this standard, the Court in Fox I found\nthe Commission\u2019s new indecency enforcement policy nei\u00ad\nther arbitrary nor capricious. Id., at 517. The Court noted\nthe Commission had acknowledged breaking new ground\nin ruling that fleeting and nonliteral expletives could be\nindecent under the controlling standards; the Court con\u00ad\ncluded the agency\u2019s reasons for expanding the scope of its\nenforcement activity were rational. Ibid. Not only was it\n\u201ccertainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense\nto distinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offen\u00ad\nsive words,\u201d ibid., but the Court agreed that the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s decision to \u201clook at the patent offensiveness of even\nisolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with the\ncontext-based approach [approved] . . . in Pacifica.\u201d Ibid.\nGiven that \u201c[e]ven isolated utterances can . . . constitute\nharmful \u2018first blow[s]\u2019 to children,\u201d the Court held that\nthe Commission could \u201cdecide it needed to step away from\nits old regime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive\n10         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas per se nonactionable.\u201d Id., at 518. Having found the\nagency\u2019s action to be neither arbitrary nor capricious, the\nCourt remanded for the Court of Appeals to address re\u00ad\nspondents\u2019 First Amendment challenges. Id., at 529\u2013530.\n   On remand from Fox I, the Court of Appeals held the\nCommission\u2019s indecency policy unconstitutionally vague\nand invalidated it in its entirety. 613 F. 3d, at 327.\nThe Court of Appeals found the policy, as expressed in\nthe 2001 Guidance and subsequent Commission decisions,\nfailed to give broadcasters sufficient notice of what would\nbe considered indecent. Surveying a number of Commis\u00ad\nsion adjudications, the court found the Commission was\ninconsistent as to which words it deemed patently offen\u00ad\nsive. See id., at 330. It also determined that the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s presumptive prohibition on the F-word and the\nS-word was plagued by vagueness because the Commission\nhad on occasion found the fleeting use of those words not\nindecent provided they occurred during a bona fide news\ninterview or were \u201cdemonstrably essential to the nature\nof an artistic or educational work.\u201d Id., at 331 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Commission\u2019s application\nof these exceptions, according to the Court of Appeals,\nleft broadcasters guessing whether an expletive would be\ndeemed artistically integral to a program or whether a\nparticular broadcast would be considered a bona fide news\ninterview. The Court of Appeals found the vagueness in\u00ad\nherent in the policy had forced broadcasters to \u201cchoose\nbetween not airing . . . controversial programs [or] risking\nmassive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses.\u201d Id.,\nat 334. And the court found that there was \u201cample evi\u00ad\ndence in the record\u201d that this harsh choice had led to a\nchill of protected speech. Ibid.\n                           2\n The procedural history regarding ABC is more brief.\nOn February 19, 2008, the Commission issued a forfeiture\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder finding the display of the woman\u2019s nude buttocks\nin NYPD Blue was actionably indecent. See In re Com-\nplaints Against Various Television Licensees Concerning\nTheir February 24, 2003 Broadcast of the Program \u201cNYPD\nBlue\u201d, 23 FCC Rcd. 3147 (2008). The Commission deter\u00ad\nmined that, regardless of medical definitions, displays of\nbuttocks fell within the category of displays of sexual or\nexcretory organs because the depiction was \u201cwidely associ\u00ad\nated with sexual arousal and closely associated by most\npeople with excretory activities.\u201d Id., at 3150. The scene\nwas deemed patently offensive as measured by contempo\u00ad\nrary community standards, ibid.; and the Commission\ndetermined that \u201c[t]he female actor\u2019s nudity is presented\nin a manner that clearly panders to and titillates the\naudience,\u201d id., at 3153. Unlike in the Fox case, the Com\u00ad\nmission imposed a forfeiture of $27,500 on each of the 45\nABC-affiliated stations that aired the indecent episode. In\na summary order the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit vacated the forfeiture order, determin\u00ad\ning that it was bound by its Fox decision striking down the\nentirety of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy. See 404\nFed. Appx., at 533.\n  The Government sought review of both judgments, see\nBrief for Petitioners 1, and this Court granted certiorari,\n564 U. S. ____ (2011). These are the cases before us.\n                              II\n  A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws\nwhich regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of\nconduct that is forbidden or required. See Connally v.\nGeneral Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926) (\u201c[A] statute\nwhich either forbids or requires the doing of an act in\nterms so vague that men of common intelligence must\nnecessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its appli\u00ad\ncation, violates the first essential of due process of law\u201d);\nPapachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 162 (1972)\n12         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cLiving under a rule of law entails various suppositions,\none of which is that \u2018[all persons] are entitled to be in\u00ad\nformed as to what the State commands or forbids\u2019 \u201d (quot\u00ad\ning Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939)\n(alteration in original))). This requirement of clarity in\nregulation is essential to the protections provided by the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). It requires\nthe invalidation of laws that are impermissibly vague. A\nconviction or punishment fails to comply with due process\nif the statute or regulation under which it is obtained\n\u201cfails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that\nit authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory en\u00ad\nforcement.\u201d Ibid. As this Court has explained, a regula\u00ad\ntion is not vague because it may at times be difficult to\nprove an incriminating fact but rather because it is un\u00ad\nclear as to what fact must be proved. See id., at 306.\n   Even when speech is not at issue, the void for vagueness\ndoctrine addresses at least two connected but discrete due\nprocess concerns: first, that regulated parties should know\nwhat is required of them so they may act accordingly;\nsecond, precision and guidance are necessary so that those\nenforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discrimina\u00ad\ntory way. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108\u2013109 (1972). When speech is involved, rigorous adher\u00ad\nence to those requirements is necessary to ensure that\nambiguity does not chill protected speech.\n   These concerns are implicated here because, at the out\u00ad\nset, the broadcasters claim they did not have, and do\nnot have, sufficient notice of what is proscribed. And\nleaving aside any concerns about facial invalidity, they\ncontend that the lengthy procedural history set forth\nabove shows that the broadcasters did not have fair notice\nof what was forbidden. Under the 2001 Guidelines in\nforce when the broadcasts occurred, a key consideration\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas \u201c \u2018whether the material dwell[ed] on or repeat[ed] at\nlength\u2019 \u201d the offending description or depiction. 613 F. 3d,\nat 322. In the 2004 Golden Globes Order, issued after the\nbroadcasts, the Commission changed course and held that\nfleeting expletives could be a statutory violation. Fox I,\n556 U. S., at 512. In the challenged orders now under\nreview the Commission applied the new principle promul\u00ad\ngated in the Golden Globes Order and determined fleeting\nexpletives and a brief moment of indecency were action\u00ad\nably indecent. This regulatory history, however, makes it\napparent that the Commission policy in place at the time\nof the broadcasts gave no notice to Fox or ABC that a\nfleeting expletive or a brief shot of nudity could be action\u00ad\nably indecent; yet Fox and ABC were found to be in viola\u00ad\ntion. The Commission\u2019s lack of notice to Fox and ABC that\nits interpretation had changed so the fleeting moments of\nindecency contained in their broadcasts were a violation of\n\u00a71464 as interpreted and enforced by the agency \u201cfail[ed]\nto provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of\nwhat is prohibited.\u201d Williams, supra, at 304. This would\nbe true with respect to a regulatory change this abrupt on\nany subject, but it is surely the case when applied to the\nregulations in question, regulations that touch upon \u201csen\u00ad\nsitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u201d Baggett\nv. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 372 (1964); see also Reno v. Amer-\nican Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 870\u2013871 (1997)\n(\u201cThe vagueness of [a content-based regulation of speech]\nraises special First Amendment concerns because of its ob\u00ad\nvious chilling effect\u201d).\n   The Government raises two arguments in response, but\nneither is persuasive. As for the two fleeting expletives,\nthe Government concedes that \u201cFox did not have reason\u00ad\nable notice at the time of the broadcasts that the Com\u00ad\nmission would consider non-repeated expletives indecent.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 28, n. 3. The Government argues,\nnonetheless, that Fox \u201ccannot establish unconstitutional\n14         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvagueness on that basis . . . because the Commission did\nnot impose a sanction where Fox lacked such notice.\u201d Ibid.\nAs the Court observed when the case was here three\nTerms ago, it is true that the Commission declined to\nimpose any forfeiture on Fox, see 556 U. S., at 513, and in\nits order the Commission claimed that it would not con\u00ad\nsider the indecent broadcasts either when considering\nwhether to renew stations\u2019 licenses or \u201cin any other con\u00ad\ntext,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13321, 13326. This \u201cpolicy of for\u00ad\nbearance,\u201d as the Government calls it, does not suffice to\nmake the issue moot. Brief for Petitioners 31. Though the\nCommission claims it will not consider the prior indecent\nbroadcasts \u201cin any context,\u201d it has the statutory power\nto take into account \u201cany history of prior offenses\u201d when\nsetting the level of a forfeiture penalty. See 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7503(b)(2)(E). Just as in the First Amendment context,\nthe due process protection against vague regulations \u201cdoes\nnot leave [regulated parties] . . . at the mercy of noblesse\noblige.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 18). Given that the Commission found it\nwas \u201cnot inequitable to hold Fox responsible for [the 2003\nbroadcast],\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13314, and that it has the\nstatutory authority to use its finding to increase any fu\u00ad\nture penalties, the Government\u2019s assurance it will elect\nnot to do so is insufficient to remedy the constitutional\nviolation.\n   In addition, when combined with the legal consequence\ndescribed above, reputational injury provides further rea\u00ad\nson for granting relief to Fox. Cf. Paul v. Davis, 424\nU. S. 693, 708\u2013709 (1976) (explaining that an \u201calteration\nof legal status . . . combined with the injury resulting\nfrom the defamation\u201d justifies the invocation of procedural\nsafeguards). As respondent CBS points out, findings of\nwrongdoing can result in harm to a broadcaster\u2019s \u201creputa\u00ad\ntion with viewers and advertisers.\u201d Brief for Respondent\nCBS Television Network Affiliates Assn. et al. 17. This\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nobservation is hardly surprising given that the challenged\norders, which are contained in the permanent Commission\nrecord, describe in strongly disapproving terms the inde\u00ad\ncent material broadcast by Fox, see, e.g., 21 FCC Rcd., at\n13310\u201313311, \u00b630 (noting the \u201cexplicit, graphic, vulgar,\nand shocking nature of Ms. Richie\u2019s comments\u201d), and Fox\u2019s\nefforts to protect children from being exposed to it, see id.,\nat 13311, \u00b633 (finding Fox had failed to exercise \u201c \u2018rea\u00ad\nsonable judgment, responsibility, and sensitivity to the\npublic\u2019s needs and tastes to avoid [a] patently offensive\nbroadcas[t]\u2019 \u201d). Commission sanctions on broadcasters for\nindecent material are widely publicized. See, e.g., F. C. C.\nFines Fox, N. Y. Times, Feb. 26, 2008, p. E2; F. C. C. Plans\nRecord Fine for CBS, Washington Post, Sept. 24, 2004,\np. E1. The challenged orders could have an adverse impact\non Fox\u2019s reputation that audiences and advertisers alike\nare entitled to take into account.\n   With respect to ABC, the Government with good reason\ndoes not argue no sanction was imposed. The fine against\nABC and its network affiliates for the seven seconds of\nnudity was nearly $1.24 million. See Brief for Respondent\nABC, Inc., et al. 7 (hereinafter ABC Brief). The Govern\u00ad\nment argues instead that ABC had notice that the scene in\nNYPD Blue would be considered indecent in light of a\n1960 decision where the Commission declared that the\n\u201ctelevising of nudes might well raise a serious question of\nprogramming contrary to 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 32 (quoting Enbanc Programming Inquiry, 44\nFCC 2303, 2307 (internal quotation marks omitted)). This\nargument does not prevail. An isolated and ambiguous\nstatement from a 1960 Commission decision does not\nsuffice for the fair notice required when the Government\nintends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly im\u00ad\npermissible speech. The Commission, furthermore, had\nreleased decisions before sanctioning ABC that declined to\nfind isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably inde\u00ad\n16         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncent. See, e.g., In re Application of WGBH, 69 F. C. C.\n2d, at 1251, 1255 (declining to find broadcasts contain-\ning nudity to be indecent and emphasizing the difference\nbetween repeated and isolated expletives); In re WPBN/\nWTOM License Subsidiary, Inc., 15 FCC Rcd. 1838,\n1840 (2000) (finding full frontal nudity in Schind-\nler\u2019s List not indecent). This is not to say, of course, that\na graphic scene from Schindler\u2019s List involving nude\nconcentration camp prisoners is the same as the shower\nscene from NYPD Blue. It does show, however, that the\nGovernment can point to nothing that would have given\nABC affirmative notice that its broadcast would be consid\u00ad\nered actionably indecent. It is likewise not sufficient for\nthe Commission to assert, as it did in its order, that\nthough \u201cthe depiction [of nudity] here is not as lengthy or\nrepeated\u201d as in some cases, the shower scene nonetheless\n\u201cdoes contain more shots or lengthier depictions of nudity\u201d\nthan in other broadcasts found not indecent. 23 FCC Rcd.,\nat 3153. This broad language fails to demonstrate that\nABC had fair notice that its broadcast could be found\nindecent. In fact, a Commission ruling prior to the airing\nof the NYPD Blue episode had deemed 30 seconds of nude\nbuttocks \u201cvery brief \u201d and not actionably indecent in the\ncontext of the broadcast. See Letter from Norman Gold\u00ad\nstein to David Molina, FCC File No. 97110028 (May 26,\n1999), in App. to Brief for Respondent ABC Television\nAffiliates Assn. et al. 1a; see also Letter from Edythe Wise\nto Susan Cavin, FCC File No. 91100738 (Aug. 13, 1992),\nid., at 18a, 19a. In light of this record of agency decisions,\nand the absence of any notice in the 2001 Guidance that\nseven seconds of nude buttocks would be found indecent,\nABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to being\nsanctioned.\n   The Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice\nprior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives\nand momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nTherefore, the Commission\u2019s standards as applied to these\nbroadcasts were vague, and the Commission\u2019s orders must\nbe set aside.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to make three observations about the\nscope of this decision. First, because the Court resolves\nthese cases on fair notice grounds under the Due Process\nClause, it need not address the First Amendment implica\u00ad\ntions of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy. It is argued\nthat this Court\u2019s ruling in Pacifica (and the less rigorous\nstandard of scrutiny it provided for the regulation of\nbroadcasters, see 438 U. S. 726) should be overruled be\u00ad\ncause the rationale of that case has been overtaken by\ntechnological change and the wide availability of multiple\nother choices for listeners and viewers. See, e.g., ABC\nBrief 48\u201357; Brief for Respondent Fox Television Stations,\nInc., et al. 15\u201326. The Government for its part maintains\nthat when it licenses a conventional broadcast spectrum,\nthe public may assume that the Government has its own\ninterest in setting certain standards. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioners 40\u201353. These arguments need not be addressed\nhere. In light of the Court\u2019s holding that the Commission\u2019s\npolicy failed to provide fair notice it is unnecessary to\nreconsider Pacifica at this time.\n   This leads to a second observation. Here, the Court\nrules that Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their\nbroadcasts that the material they were broadcasting could\nbe found actionably indecent under then-existing policies.\nGiven this disposition, it is unnecessary for the Court\nto address the constitutionality of the current indecency\npolicy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and sub\u00ad\nsequent adjudications. The Court adheres to its normal\npractice of declining to decide cases not before it. See,\ne.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.

Argued January 10, 2012\u2014Decided June 21, 2012*\nTitle 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 bans the broadcast of \u201cany obscene, indecent, or\n   profane language.\u201d       The Federal Communications Commission\n   (Commission) began enforcing \u00a71464 in the 1970\u2019s. In FCC v. Pacif-\n   ica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, this Court found that the Commission\u2019s\n   order banning George Carlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue passed\n   First Amendment scrutiny, but did not decide whether \u201can occasional\n   expletive . . . would justify any sanction,\u201d id., at 750. In the ensuing\n   years, the Commission went from strictly observing the narrow cir-\n   cumstances of Pacifica to indicating that it would assess the full con-\n   text of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than limit its regulation\n   to an index of indecent words or pictures. However, it continued to\n   note the important difference between isolated and repeated broad-\n   casts of indecent material. And in a 2001 policy statement, it even\n   included, as one of the factors significant to the determination of\n   what was patently offensive, \u201cwhether the material dwells on or re-\n   peats at length\u201d the offending description or depiction.\n      It was against this regulatory background that the three incidents\n   at issue took place. Two concern isolated utterances of obscene words\n   during two live broadcasts aired by respondent Fox Television Sta-\n   tions, Inc. The third occurred during an episode of a television show\n   broadcast by respondent ABC Television Network, when the nude\n   buttocks of an adult female character were shown for approximately\n   seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment. After these\n   incidents, but before the Commission issued Notices of Apparent Lia-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with Federal Communications Commission v. ABC, Inc.,\net al. (see this Court\u2019s Rule 12.4), also on certiorari to the same court.\n2              FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    bility to Fox and ABC, the Commission issued its Golden Globes Or-\n    der, declaring for the first time that fleeting expletives could be ac-\n    tionable. It then concluded that the Fox and ABC broadcasts violated\n    this new standard. It found the Fox broadcasts indecent, but de-\n    clined to propose forfeitures. The Second Circuit reversed, finding\n    the Commission\u2019s decision to modify its indecency enforcement re-\n    gime to regulate fleeting expletives arbitrary and capricious. This\n    Court reversed and remanded for the Second Circuit to address re-\n    spondents\u2019 First Amendment challenges. FCC v. Fox Television Sta-\n    tions, Inc., 556 U. S. 502. On remand, the Second Circuit found the\n    policy unconstitutionally vague and invalidated it in its entirety. In\n    the ABC case, the Commission found the display actionably indecent,\n    and imposed a $27,500 forfeiture on each of the 45 ABC-affiliated\n    stations that aired the episode. The Second Circuit vacated the order\n    in light of its Fox decision.\nHeld: Because the Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice\n prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and mo-\n mentary nudity could be found actionably indecent, the Commission\u2019s\n standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague. Pp. 11\u201318.\n    (a) The fundamental principle that laws regulating persons or enti-\n ties must give fair notice of what conduct is required or proscribed,\n see, e.g., Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391, is essen-\n tial to the protections provided by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\n cess Clause, see United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304, which\n requires the invalidation of impermissibly vague laws. A conviction\n or punishment fails to comply with due process if the statute or regu-\n lation under which it is obtained \u201cfails to provide a person of ordinary\n intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless\n that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforce-\n ment.\u201d Ibid. The void for vagueness doctrine addresses at least two\n connected but discrete due process concerns: Regulated parties\n should know what is required of them so they may act accordingly;\n and precision and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the\n law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. When speech is\n involved, rigorous adherence to those requirements is necessary to\n ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech. Pp. 11\u201312.\n    (b) These concerns are implicated here, where the broadcasters\n claim that the lengthy procedural history of their cases shows that\n they did not have fair notice of what was forbidden. Under the 2001\n Guidelines in force when the broadcasts occurred, a key consideration\n was \u201cwhether the material dwell[ed] on or repeat[ed] at length\u201d the\n offending description or depiction, but in the 2004 Golden Globes Or-\n der, issued after the broadcasts, the Commission changed course and\n held that fleeting expletives could be a statutory violation. It then\n                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  applied this new principle to these cases. Its lack of notice to Fox and\n  ABC of its changed interpretation failed to give them \u201cfair notice of\n  what is prohibited.\u201d Williams, supra, at 304. Pp. 12\u201313.\n     (c) Neither of the Government\u2019s contrary arguments is persuasive.\n  It claims that Fox cannot establish unconstitutional vagueness be-\n  cause the Commission declined to impose a forfeiture on Fox and said\n  that it would not consider the indecent broadcast in renewing station\n  licenses or in other contexts. But the Commission has the statutory\n  power to take into account \u201cany history of prior offenses\u201d when set-\n  ting a forfeiture penalty, 47 U. S. C. \u00a7503(b)(2)(E), and the due pro-\n  cess protection against vague regulations \u201cdoes not leave [regulated\n  parties] . . . at the mercy of noblesse oblige.\u201d United States v. Stevens,\n  559 U. S. ___, ___. The challenged orders could also have an adverse\n  impact on Fox\u2019s reputation with audiences and advertisers alike.\n     The Government argues that ABC had notice that its broadcast\n  would be considered indecent. But an isolated statement in a 1960\n  Commission decision declaring that televising nudes might be con-\n  trary to \u00a71464 does not suffice for the fair notice required when the\n  Government intends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly\n  impermissible speech. Moreover, previous Commission decisions had\n  declined to find isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably inde-\n  cent. In light of these agency decisions, and the absence of any notice\n  in the 2001 Guidance that seven seconds of nude buttocks would be\n  found indecent, ABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to\n  being sanctioned. Pp. 13\u201317.\n     (d) It is necessary to make three observations about this decision\u2019s\n  scope. First, because the Court resolves these cases on fair notice\n  grounds under the Due Process Clause, it need not address the First\n  Amendment implications of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy or re-\n  consider Pacifica at this time. Second, because the Court rules that\n  Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their broadcasts that their\n  material could be found actionably indecent under then-existing poli-\n  cies, the Court need not address the constitutionality of the current\n  indecency policy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and subse-\n  quent adjudications. Third, this opinion leaves the Commission free\n  to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of\n  the public interest and applicable legal requirements and leaves\n  courts free to review the current, or any modified, policy in light of its\n  content and application.

Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502,\n529 (2009) (Fox I), the Court held that the Federal Com\u00ad\nmunication Commission\u2019s decision to modify its indecency\nenforcement regime to regulate so-called fleeting exple\u00ad\ntives was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The Court\nthen declined to address the constitutionality of the policy,\nhowever, because the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit had yet to do so. On remand, the Court\nof Appeals found the policy was vague and, as a result,\nunconstitutional. 613 F. 3d 317 (2010). The case now\nreturns to this Court for decision upon the constitutional\nquestion.\n                          I\n  In Fox I, the Court described both the regulatory\nframework through which the Commission regulates\nbroadcast indecency and the long procedural history of\n2          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis case. The Court need not repeat all that history, but\nsome preliminary discussion is necessary to understand\nthe constitutional issue the case now presents.\n                             A\n   Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 provides that \u201c[w]hoever utters\nany obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of\nradio communication shall be fined . . . or imprisoned not\nmore than two years, or both.\u201d The Federal Communi\u00ad\ncations Commission (Commission) has been instructed by\nCongress to enforce \u00a71464 between the hours of 6 a.m.\nand 10 p.m., see Public Telecommunications Act of 1992,\n\u00a715(a), 106 Stat. 954, note following 47 U. S. C. \u00a7303,\np. 113 (Broadcasting of Indecent Programming). And the\nCommission has applied its regulations to radio and tele\u00ad\nvision broadcasters alike, see Fox I, supra, at 505\u2013506;\nsee also 47 CFR \u00a773.3999 (2010) (Commission regulation\nprohibiting the broadcast of any obscene material or any\nindecent material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m.). Although\nthe Commission has had the authority to regulate inde\u00ad\ncent broadcasts under \u00a71464 since 1948 (and its prede\u00ad\ncessor commission, the Federal Radio Commission, since\n1927), it did not begin to enforce \u00a71464 until the 1970\u2019s.\nSee Campbell, Pacifica Reconsidered: Implications for the\nCurrent Controversy over Broadcast Indecency, 63 Fed.\nCom. L. J. 195, 198 (2010).\n   This Court first reviewed the Commission\u2019s indecency\npolicy in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978).\nIn Pacifica, the Commission determined that George\nCarlin\u2019s \u201cFilthy Words\u201d monologue was indecent. It con\u00ad\ntained \u201c \u2018language that describes, in terms patently offen\u00ad\nsive as measured by contemporary community standards\nfor the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities\nand organs, at times of the day when there is a reasonable\nrisk that children may be in the audience.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 732\n(quoting 56 F. C. C. 2d 94, 98 (1975)). This Court upheld\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Commission\u2019s ruling. The broadcaster\u2019s statutory\nchallenge was rejected. The Court held the Commission\nwas not engaged in impermissible censorship within the\nmeaning of 47 U. S. C. \u00a7326 (1976 ed.), see 438 U. S., at\n735\u2013739, and that \u00a71464\u2019s definition of indecency was not\nconfined to speech with an appeal to the prurient interest,\nsee id., at 738\u2013741. Finding no First Amendment viola\u00ad\ntion, the decision explained the constitutional standard\nunder which regulations of broadcasters are assessed. It\nobserved that \u201cbroadcast media have established a uniquely\npervasive presence in the lives of all Americans,\u201d id., at\n748, and that \u201cbroadcasting is uniquely accessible to chil\u00ad\ndren, even those too young to read,\u201d id., at 749. In light\nof these considerations, \u201cbroadcasting . . . has received the\nmost limited First Amendment protection.\u201d Id., at 748.\nUnder this standard the Commission\u2019s order passed con\u00ad\nstitutional scrutiny. The Court did note the narrowness of\nits holding, explaining that it was not deciding whether\n\u201can occasional expletive . . . would justify any sanction.\u201d\nId., at 750; see also id., at 760\u2013761 (Powell, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201c[C]ertainly the\nCourt\u2019s holding . . . does not speak to cases involving the\nisolated use of a potentially offensive word in the course of\na radio broadcast, as distinguished from the verbal shock\ntreatment administered by respondent here\u201d).\n   From 1978 to 1987, the Commission did not go beyond\nthe narrow circumstances of Pacifica and brought no\nindecency enforcement actions. See In re Infinity Broad-\ncasting Corp., 3 FCC Rcd. 930 (1987); see also In re Appli-\ncation of WGBH Educ. Foundation, 69 F. C. C. 2d 1250,\n1254 (1978) (Commission declaring it \u201cintend[s] strictly to\nobserve the narrowness of the Pacifica holding\u201d). Recog\u00ad\nnizing that Pacifica provided \u201cno general prerogative to\nintervene in any case where words similar or identical to\nthose in Pacifica are broadcast over a licensed radio or\ntelevision station,\u201d the Commission distinguished between\n4          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe \u201crepetitive occurrence of the \u2018indecent\u2019 words\u201d (such as\nin the Carlin monologue) and an \u201cisolated\u201d or \u201coccasional\u201d\nexpletive, that would not necessarily be actionable. 69\nF. C. C. 2d, at 1254.\n   In 1987, the Commission determined it was applying the\nPacifica standard in too narrow a way. It stated that in\nlater cases its definition of indecent language would \u201cap\u00ad\npropriately includ[e] a broader range of material than the\nseven specific words at issue in [the Carlin monologue].\u201d\nIn re Pacifica Foundation Inc., 2 FCC Rcd. 2698, 2699.\nThus, the Commission indicated it would use the \u201cgeneric\ndefinition of indecency\u201d articulated in its 1975 Pacifica\norder, Infinity Order, 3 FCC Rcd., at 930, and assess the\nfull context of allegedly indecent broadcasts rather than\nlimiting its regulation to a \u201ccomprehensive index . . . of\nindecent words or pictorial depictions,\u201d id., at 932.\n   Even under this context based approach, the Commis\u00ad\nsion continued to note the important difference between\nisolated and repeated broadcasts of indecent material. See\nibid. (considering variables in determining whether mate\u00ad\nrial is patently offensive including \u201cwhether allegedly\noffensive material is isolated or fleeting\u201d). In the context\nof expletives, the Commission determined \u201cdeliberate and\nrepetitive use in a patently offensive manner is a requisite\nto a finding of indecency.\u201d Pacifica Order, 2 FCC Rcd., at\n2699. For speech \u201cinvolving the description or depiction\nof sexual or excretory functions . . . [t]he mere fact that\nspecific words or phrases are not repeated does not man\u00ad\ndate a finding that material that is otherwise patently\noffensive . . . is not indecent.\u201d Ibid.\n   In 2001, the Commission issued a policy statement\nintended \u201cto provide guidance to the broadcast industry\nregarding [its] caselaw interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 and\n[its] enforcement policies with respect to broadcast inde\u00ad\ncency.\u201d In re Industry Guidance on Commission\u2019s Case\nLaw Interpreting 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464 and Enforcement\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPolicies Regarding Broadcast Indecency, 16 FCC Rcd.\n7999. In that document the Commission restated that for\nmaterial to be indecent it must depict sexual or excretory\norgans or activities and be patently offensive as measured\nby contemporary community standards for the broadcast\nmedium. Id., at 8002. Describing the framework of what\nit considered patently offensive, the Commission explained\nthat three factors had proved significant:\n    \u201c(1) [T]he explicitness or graphic nature of the de\u00ad\n    scription or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or\n    activities; (2) whether the material dwells on or re\u00ad\n    peats at length descriptions of sexual or excretory or\u00ad\n    gans or activities; (3) whether the material appears to\n    pander or is used to titillate, or whether the material\n    appears to have been presented for its shock value.\u201d\n    Id., at 8003 (emphasis deleted).\nAs regards the second of these factors, the Commission\nexplained that \u201c[r]epetition of and persistent focus on\nsexual or excretory material have been cited consistently\nas factors that exacerbate the potential offensiveness of\nbroadcasts. In contrast, where sexual or excretory refer\u00ad\nences have been made once or have been passing or fleet\u00ad\ning in nature, this characteristic has tended to weigh\nagainst a finding of indecency.\u201d Id., at 8008. The Com\u00ad\nmission then gave examples of material that was not\nfound indecent because it was fleeting and isolated, id., at\n8008\u20138009 (citing, e.g., L. M. Communications of South\nCarolina, Inc.

Right. So f *** \u2018em.\u201d 613 F. 3d,\nat 323. Second, Fox broadcast the Billboard Music Awards\nagain in 2003. There, a person named Nicole Richie\nmade the following unscripted remark while presenting an\naward: \u201cHave you ever tried to get cow s*** out of a Prada\npurse? It\u2019s not so f ***ing simple.\u201d Ibid. The third in\u00ad\ncident involved an episode of NYPD Blue, a regular tele\u00ad\nvision show broadcast by respondent ABC Television\nNetwork. The episode broadcast on February 25, 2003,\nshowed the nude buttocks of an adult female character for\napproximately seven seconds and for a moment the side\nof her breast. During the scene, in which the character\nwas preparing to take a shower, a child portraying her boy\u00ad\nfriend\u2019s son entered the bathroom. A moment of awk\u00ad\nwardness followed. 404 Fed. Appx. 530, 533\u2013534 (CA2\n2011). The Commission received indecency complaints\nabout all three broadcasts. See Fox I, 556 U. S., at 510;\n404 Fed. Appx., at 534.\n   After these incidents, but before the Commission issued\nNotices of Apparent Liability to Fox and ABC, the Com\u00ad\nmission issued a decision sanctioning NBC for a comment\nmade by the singer Bono during the 2003 Golden Globe\nAwards. Upon winning the award for Best Original Song,\nBono exclaimed: \u201c \u2018This is really, really, f ***ing brilliant.\nReally, really great.\u2019 \u201d In re Complaints Against Various\nBroadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the \u201cGolden\nGlobe Awards\u201d Program, 19 FCC Rcd. 4975, 4976, n. 4\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2004) (Golden Globes Order). Reversing a decision by its\nenforcement bureau, the Commission found the use of\nthe F-word actionably indecent. Id., at 4975\u20134976. The\nCommission held that the word was \u201cone of the most vul\u00ad\ngar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity\nin the English language,\u201d and thus found \u201cany use of that\nword or a variation, in any context, inherently has a sex\u00ad\nual connotation.\u201d Id., at 4978\u20134979. Turning to the iso\u00ad\nlated nature of the expletive, the Commission reversed prior\nrulings that had found fleeting expletives not indecent.\nThe Commission held \u201cthe mere fact that specific words or\nphrases are not sustained or repeated does not mandate a\nfinding that material that is otherwise patently offensive\nto the broadcast medium is not indecent.\u201d Id., at 4980; see\nalso id., at 4982 (\u201cJust as the Court [in Pacifica] held\nthat . . . the George Carlin routine \u2018could have enlarged\na child\u2019s vocabulary in an instant,\u2019 we believe that even\nisolated broadcasts of the \u2018F-Word\u2019 in situations such as\nthat here could do so as well\u201d).\n                            C\n   Even though the incidents at issue in these cases took\nplace before the Golden Globes Order, the Commission\napplied its new policy regarding fleeting expletives and\nfleeting nudity. It found the broadcasts by respondents\nFox and ABC to be in violation of this standard.\n                            1\n  As to Fox, the Commission found the two Billboard\nAwards broadcasts indecent in In re Complaints Regard-\ning Various Television Broadcasts Between February 2,\n2002, and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 2664 (2006). Nu\u00ad\nmerous parties petitioned for a review of the order in the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nThe Court of Appeals granted the Commission\u2019s request\nfor a voluntary remand so that it could respond to the\n8          FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nparties\u2019 objections. Fox Television Stations, Inc. v. FCC,\n489 F. 3d 444, 453 (2007). In its remand order, the Com\u00ad\nmission applied its tripartite definition of patently offen\u00ad\nsive material from its 2001 Order and found that both\nbroadcasts fell well within its scope. See In re Complaints\nRegarding Various Television Broadcasts Between Febru-\nary 2, 2002, and March 8, 2005, 21 FCC Rcd. 13299 (2006)\n(Remand Order); see also Fox I, supra, at 511\u2013513 (dis\u00ad\ncussing in detail the Commission\u2019s findings). As pertains\nto the constitutional issue in these cases, the Commission\nnoted that under the policy clarified in the Golden Globes\nOrder, \u201ccategorically requiring repeated use of expletives\nin order to find material indecent is inconsistent with\nour general approach to indecency enforcement.\u201d Remand\nOrder, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13308; see also id., at 13325\n(\u201c[U]nder our Golden Globe precedent, the fact that Cher\nused the \u2018F-word\u2019 once does not remove her comment from\nthe realm of actionable indecency\u201d). Though the Commis\u00ad\nsion deemed Fox should have known Nicole Richie\u2019s com\u00ad\nments were actionably indecent even prior to the Golden\nGlobes Order, 21 FCC Rcd., at 13307, it declined to pro\u00ad\npose a forfeiture in light of the limited nature of the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit\u2019s remand. Id., at 13321. The Commission\nacknowledged that \u201cit was not apparent that Fox could be\npenalized for Cher\u2019s comment at the time it was broad\u00ad\ncast.\u201d And so, as in the Golden Globes case it imposed no\npenalty for that broadcast. Id., at 13324, 13326.\n   Fox and various intervenors returned to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, raising ad\u00ad\nministrative, statutory, and constitutional challenges to\nthe Commission\u2019s indecency regulations. See Fox Televi-\nsion Stations, Inc. v. FCC, 489 F. 3d 444. In a 2-to-1 deci\u00ad\nsion, with Judge Leval dissenting, the Court of Appeals\nfound the Remand Order arbitrary and capricious because\n\u201cthe FCC has made a 180-degree turn regarding its treat\u00ad\nment of \u2018fleeting expletives\u2019 without providing a reasoned\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nexplanation justifying the about-face.\u201d 489 F. 3d, at 455.\nWhile noting its skepticism as to whether the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s fleeting expletive regime \u201cwould pass constitutional\nmuster,\u201d the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to ad\u00ad\ndress the issue. Id., at 462.\n   The case came here on certiorari. Citing the Adminis\u00ad\ntrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7551 et seq., this Court\nnoted that the Judiciary may set aside agency action that\nis arbitrary or capricious. In the context of a change in\npolicy (such as the Commission\u2019s determination that fleet\u00ad\ning expletives could be indecent), the decision held an\nagency, in the ordinary course, should acknowledge that it\nis in fact changing its position and \u201cshow that there are\ngood reasons for the new policy.\u201d Fox I, 553 U. S., at 515.\nThere is no need, however, for an agency to provide de\u00ad\ntailed justifications for every change or to show that the\nreasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for\nthe old one. Ibid.\n   Judged under this standard, the Court in Fox I found\nthe Commission\u2019s new indecency enforcement policy nei\u00ad\nther arbitrary nor capricious. Id., at 517. The Court noted\nthe Commission had acknowledged breaking new ground\nin ruling that fleeting and nonliteral expletives could be\nindecent under the controlling standards; the Court con\u00ad\ncluded the agency\u2019s reasons for expanding the scope of its\nenforcement activity were rational. Ibid. Not only was it\n\u201ccertainly reasonable to determine that it made no sense\nto distinguish between literal and nonliteral uses of offen\u00ad\nsive words,\u201d ibid., but the Court agreed that the Commis\u00ad\nsion\u2019s decision to \u201clook at the patent offensiveness of even\nisolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with the\ncontext-based approach [approved] . . . in Pacifica.\u201d Ibid.\nGiven that \u201c[e]ven isolated utterances can . . . constitute\nharmful \u2018first blow[s]\u2019 to children,\u201d the Court held that\nthe Commission could \u201cdecide it needed to step away from\nits old regime where nonrepetitive use of an expletive\n10         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas per se nonactionable.\u201d Id., at 518. Having found the\nagency\u2019s action to be neither arbitrary nor capricious, the\nCourt remanded for the Court of Appeals to address re\u00ad\nspondents\u2019 First Amendment challenges. Id., at 529\u2013530.\n   On remand from Fox I, the Court of Appeals held the\nCommission\u2019s indecency policy unconstitutionally vague\nand invalidated it in its entirety. 613 F. 3d, at 327.\nThe Court of Appeals found the policy, as expressed in\nthe 2001 Guidance and subsequent Commission decisions,\nfailed to give broadcasters sufficient notice of what would\nbe considered indecent. Surveying a number of Commis\u00ad\nsion adjudications, the court found the Commission was\ninconsistent as to which words it deemed patently offen\u00ad\nsive. See id., at 330. It also determined that the Com\u00ad\nmission\u2019s presumptive prohibition on the F-word and the\nS-word was plagued by vagueness because the Commission\nhad on occasion found the fleeting use of those words not\nindecent provided they occurred during a bona fide news\ninterview or were \u201cdemonstrably essential to the nature\nof an artistic or educational work.\u201d Id., at 331 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Commission\u2019s application\nof these exceptions, according to the Court of Appeals,\nleft broadcasters guessing whether an expletive would be\ndeemed artistically integral to a program or whether a\nparticular broadcast would be considered a bona fide news\ninterview. The Court of Appeals found the vagueness in\u00ad\nherent in the policy had forced broadcasters to \u201cchoose\nbetween not airing . . . controversial programs [or] risking\nmassive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses.\u201d Id.,\nat 334. And the court found that there was \u201cample evi\u00ad\ndence in the record\u201d that this harsh choice had led to a\nchill of protected speech. Ibid.\n                           2\n The procedural history regarding ABC is more brief.\nOn February 19, 2008, the Commission issued a forfeiture\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder finding the display of the woman\u2019s nude buttocks\nin NYPD Blue was actionably indecent. See In re Com-\nplaints Against Various Television Licensees Concerning\nTheir February 24, 2003 Broadcast of the Program \u201cNYPD\nBlue\u201d, 23 FCC Rcd. 3147 (2008). The Commission deter\u00ad\nmined that, regardless of medical definitions, displays of\nbuttocks fell within the category of displays of sexual or\nexcretory organs because the depiction was \u201cwidely associ\u00ad\nated with sexual arousal and closely associated by most\npeople with excretory activities.\u201d Id., at 3150. The scene\nwas deemed patently offensive as measured by contempo\u00ad\nrary community standards, ibid.; and the Commission\ndetermined that \u201c[t]he female actor\u2019s nudity is presented\nin a manner that clearly panders to and titillates the\naudience,\u201d id., at 3153. Unlike in the Fox case, the Com\u00ad\nmission imposed a forfeiture of $27,500 on each of the 45\nABC-affiliated stations that aired the indecent episode. In\na summary order the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe Second Circuit vacated the forfeiture order, determin\u00ad\ning that it was bound by its Fox decision striking down the\nentirety of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy. See 404\nFed. Appx., at 533.\n  The Government sought review of both judgments, see\nBrief for Petitioners 1, and this Court granted certiorari,\n564 U. S. ____ (2011). These are the cases before us.\n                              II\n  A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws\nwhich regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of\nconduct that is forbidden or required. See Connally v.\nGeneral Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385, 391 (1926) (\u201c[A] statute\nwhich either forbids or requires the doing of an act in\nterms so vague that men of common intelligence must\nnecessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its appli\u00ad\ncation, violates the first essential of due process of law\u201d);\nPapachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U. S. 156, 162 (1972)\n12         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(\u201cLiving under a rule of law entails various suppositions,\none of which is that \u2018[all persons] are entitled to be in\u00ad\nformed as to what the State commands or forbids\u2019 \u201d (quot\u00ad\ning Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939)\n(alteration in original))). This requirement of clarity in\nregulation is essential to the protections provided by the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See United\nStates v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 304 (2008). It requires\nthe invalidation of laws that are impermissibly vague. A\nconviction or punishment fails to comply with due process\nif the statute or regulation under which it is obtained\n\u201cfails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair\nnotice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that\nit authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory en\u00ad\nforcement.\u201d Ibid. As this Court has explained, a regula\u00ad\ntion is not vague because it may at times be difficult to\nprove an incriminating fact but rather because it is un\u00ad\nclear as to what fact must be proved. See id., at 306.\n   Even when speech is not at issue, the void for vagueness\ndoctrine addresses at least two connected but discrete due\nprocess concerns: first, that regulated parties should know\nwhat is required of them so they may act accordingly;\nsecond, precision and guidance are necessary so that those\nenforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discrimina\u00ad\ntory way. See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,\n108\u2013109 (1972). When speech is involved, rigorous adher\u00ad\nence to those requirements is necessary to ensure that\nambiguity does not chill protected speech.\n   These concerns are implicated here because, at the out\u00ad\nset, the broadcasters claim they did not have, and do\nnot have, sufficient notice of what is proscribed. And\nleaving aside any concerns about facial invalidity, they\ncontend that the lengthy procedural history set forth\nabove shows that the broadcasters did not have fair notice\nof what was forbidden. Under the 2001 Guidelines in\nforce when the broadcasts occurred, a key consideration\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas \u201c \u2018whether the material dwell[ed] on or repeat[ed] at\nlength\u2019 \u201d the offending description or depiction. 613 F. 3d,\nat 322. In the 2004 Golden Globes Order, issued after the\nbroadcasts, the Commission changed course and held that\nfleeting expletives could be a statutory violation. Fox I,\n556 U. S., at 512. In the challenged orders now under\nreview the Commission applied the new principle promul\u00ad\ngated in the Golden Globes Order and determined fleeting\nexpletives and a brief moment of indecency were action\u00ad\nably indecent. This regulatory history, however, makes it\napparent that the Commission policy in place at the time\nof the broadcasts gave no notice to Fox or ABC that a\nfleeting expletive or a brief shot of nudity could be action\u00ad\nably indecent; yet Fox and ABC were found to be in viola\u00ad\ntion. The Commission\u2019s lack of notice to Fox and ABC that\nits interpretation had changed so the fleeting moments of\nindecency contained in their broadcasts were a violation of\n\u00a71464 as interpreted and enforced by the agency \u201cfail[ed]\nto provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of\nwhat is prohibited.\u201d Williams, supra, at 304. This would\nbe true with respect to a regulatory change this abrupt on\nany subject, but it is surely the case when applied to the\nregulations in question, regulations that touch upon \u201csen\u00ad\nsitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u201d Baggett\nv. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 372 (1964); see also Reno v. Amer-\nican Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 870\u2013871 (1997)\n(\u201cThe vagueness of [a content-based regulation of speech]\nraises special First Amendment concerns because of its ob\u00ad\nvious chilling effect\u201d).\n   The Government raises two arguments in response, but\nneither is persuasive. As for the two fleeting expletives,\nthe Government concedes that \u201cFox did not have reason\u00ad\nable notice at the time of the broadcasts that the Com\u00ad\nmission would consider non-repeated expletives indecent.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioners 28, n. 3. The Government argues,\nnonetheless, that Fox \u201ccannot establish unconstitutional\n14         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvagueness on that basis . . . because the Commission did\nnot impose a sanction where Fox lacked such notice.\u201d Ibid.\nAs the Court observed when the case was here three\nTerms ago, it is true that the Commission declined to\nimpose any forfeiture on Fox, see 556 U. S., at 513, and in\nits order the Commission claimed that it would not con\u00ad\nsider the indecent broadcasts either when considering\nwhether to renew stations\u2019 licenses or \u201cin any other con\u00ad\ntext,\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13321, 13326. This \u201cpolicy of for\u00ad\nbearance,\u201d as the Government calls it, does not suffice to\nmake the issue moot. Brief for Petitioners 31. Though the\nCommission claims it will not consider the prior indecent\nbroadcasts \u201cin any context,\u201d it has the statutory power\nto take into account \u201cany history of prior offenses\u201d when\nsetting the level of a forfeiture penalty. See 47 U. S. C.\n\u00a7503(b)(2)(E). Just as in the First Amendment context,\nthe due process protection against vague regulations \u201cdoes\nnot leave [regulated parties] . . . at the mercy of noblesse\noblige.\u201d United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 18). Given that the Commission found it\nwas \u201cnot inequitable to hold Fox responsible for [the 2003\nbroadcast],\u201d 21 FCC Rcd., at 13314, and that it has the\nstatutory authority to use its finding to increase any fu\u00ad\nture penalties, the Government\u2019s assurance it will elect\nnot to do so is insufficient to remedy the constitutional\nviolation.\n   In addition, when combined with the legal consequence\ndescribed above, reputational injury provides further rea\u00ad\nson for granting relief to Fox. Cf. Paul v. Davis, 424\nU. S. 693, 708\u2013709 (1976) (explaining that an \u201calteration\nof legal status . . . combined with the injury resulting\nfrom the defamation\u201d justifies the invocation of procedural\nsafeguards). As respondent CBS points out, findings of\nwrongdoing can result in harm to a broadcaster\u2019s \u201creputa\u00ad\ntion with viewers and advertisers.\u201d Brief for Respondent\nCBS Television Network Affiliates Assn. et al. 17. This\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nobservation is hardly surprising given that the challenged\norders, which are contained in the permanent Commission\nrecord, describe in strongly disapproving terms the inde\u00ad\ncent material broadcast by Fox, see, e.g., 21 FCC Rcd., at\n13310\u201313311, \u00b630 (noting the \u201cexplicit, graphic, vulgar,\nand shocking nature of Ms. Richie\u2019s comments\u201d), and Fox\u2019s\nefforts to protect children from being exposed to it, see id.,\nat 13311, \u00b633 (finding Fox had failed to exercise \u201c \u2018rea\u00ad\nsonable judgment, responsibility, and sensitivity to the\npublic\u2019s needs and tastes to avoid [a] patently offensive\nbroadcas[t]\u2019 \u201d). Commission sanctions on broadcasters for\nindecent material are widely publicized. See, e.g., F. C. C.\nFines Fox, N. Y. Times, Feb. 26, 2008, p. E2; F. C. C. Plans\nRecord Fine for CBS, Washington Post, Sept. 24, 2004,\np. E1. The challenged orders could have an adverse impact\non Fox\u2019s reputation that audiences and advertisers alike\nare entitled to take into account.\n   With respect to ABC, the Government with good reason\ndoes not argue no sanction was imposed. The fine against\nABC and its network affiliates for the seven seconds of\nnudity was nearly $1.24 million. See Brief for Respondent\nABC, Inc., et al. 7 (hereinafter ABC Brief). The Govern\u00ad\nment argues instead that ABC had notice that the scene in\nNYPD Blue would be considered indecent in light of a\n1960 decision where the Commission declared that the\n\u201ctelevising of nudes might well raise a serious question of\nprogramming contrary to 18 U. S. C. \u00a71464.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioners 32 (quoting Enbanc Programming Inquiry, 44\nFCC 2303, 2307 (internal quotation marks omitted)). This\nargument does not prevail. An isolated and ambiguous\nstatement from a 1960 Commission decision does not\nsuffice for the fair notice required when the Government\nintends to impose over a $1 million fine for allegedly im\u00ad\npermissible speech. The Commission, furthermore, had\nreleased decisions before sanctioning ABC that declined to\nfind isolated and brief moments of nudity actionably inde\u00ad\n16         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncent. See, e.g., In re Application of WGBH, 69 F. C. C.\n2d, at 1251, 1255 (declining to find broadcasts contain-\ning nudity to be indecent and emphasizing the difference\nbetween repeated and isolated expletives); In re WPBN/\nWTOM License Subsidiary, Inc., 15 FCC Rcd. 1838,\n1840 (2000) (finding full frontal nudity in Schind-\nler\u2019s List not indecent). This is not to say, of course, that\na graphic scene from Schindler\u2019s List involving nude\nconcentration camp prisoners is the same as the shower\nscene from NYPD Blue. It does show, however, that the\nGovernment can point to nothing that would have given\nABC affirmative notice that its broadcast would be consid\u00ad\nered actionably indecent. It is likewise not sufficient for\nthe Commission to assert, as it did in its order, that\nthough \u201cthe depiction [of nudity] here is not as lengthy or\nrepeated\u201d as in some cases, the shower scene nonetheless\n\u201cdoes contain more shots or lengthier depictions of nudity\u201d\nthan in other broadcasts found not indecent. 23 FCC Rcd.,\nat 3153. This broad language fails to demonstrate that\nABC had fair notice that its broadcast could be found\nindecent. In fact, a Commission ruling prior to the airing\nof the NYPD Blue episode had deemed 30 seconds of nude\nbuttocks \u201cvery brief \u201d and not actionably indecent in the\ncontext of the broadcast. See Letter from Norman Gold\u00ad\nstein to David Molina, FCC File No. 97110028 (May 26,\n1999), in App. to Brief for Respondent ABC Television\nAffiliates Assn. et al. 1a; see also Letter from Edythe Wise\nto Susan Cavin, FCC File No. 91100738 (Aug. 13, 1992),\nid., at 18a, 19a. In light of this record of agency decisions,\nand the absence of any notice in the 2001 Guidance that\nseven seconds of nude buttocks would be found indecent,\nABC lacked constitutionally sufficient notice prior to being\nsanctioned.\n   The Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice\nprior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives\nand momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nTherefore, the Commission\u2019s standards as applied to these\nbroadcasts were vague, and the Commission\u2019s orders must\nbe set aside.\n                              III\n   It is necessary to make three observations about the\nscope of this decision. First, because the Court resolves\nthese cases on fair notice grounds under the Due Process\nClause, it need not address the First Amendment implica\u00ad\ntions of the Commission\u2019s indecency policy. It is argued\nthat this Court\u2019s ruling in Pacifica (and the less rigorous\nstandard of scrutiny it provided for the regulation of\nbroadcasters, see 438 U. S. 726) should be overruled be\u00ad\ncause the rationale of that case has been overtaken by\ntechnological change and the wide availability of multiple\nother choices for listeners and viewers. See, e.g., ABC\nBrief 48\u201357; Brief for Respondent Fox Television Stations,\nInc., et al. 15\u201326. The Government for its part maintains\nthat when it licenses a conventional broadcast spectrum,\nthe public may assume that the Government has its own\ninterest in setting certain standards. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioners 40\u201353. These arguments need not be addressed\nhere. In light of the Court\u2019s holding that the Commission\u2019s\npolicy failed to provide fair notice it is unnecessary to\nreconsider Pacifica at this time.\n   This leads to a second observation. Here, the Court\nrules that Fox and ABC lacked notice at the time of their\nbroadcasts that the material they were broadcasting could\nbe found actionably indecent under then-existing policies.\nGiven this disposition, it is unnecessary for the Court\nto address the constitutionality of the current indecency\npolicy as expressed in the Golden Globes Order and sub\u00ad\nsequent adjudications. The Court adheres to its normal\npractice of declining to decide cases not before it. See,\ne.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629, 631 (1950) (\u201cBroader\nissues have been urged for our consideration, but we\n18         FCC v. FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadhere to the principle of deciding constitutional ques\u00ad\ntions only in the context of the particular case before the\nCourt\u201d).\n   Third, this opinion leaves the Commission free to modify\nits current indecency policy in light of its determination of\nthe public interest and applicable legal requirements. And\nit leaves the courts free to review the current policy or any\nmodified policy in light of its content and application.\n                          *    *  *\n  The judgments of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit are vacated, and the cases are re\u00ad\nmanded for further proceedings consistent with the prin\u00ad\nciples set forth in this opinion.\n                                          It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR took no part in the consideration\nor decision of these cases.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          1\n\n             GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n                         _________________\n\n                         No. 10\u20131293\n                         _________________\n\n\nFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, ET AL., \n\nPETITIONERS v.

Pacifica\nFoundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978), was wrong when it\nissued. Time, technological advances, and the Commis-\nsion\u2019s untenable rulings in the cases now before the Court\nshow why Pacifica bears reconsideration. Cf. FCC v. Fox\nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U. S. 502, 532\u2013535 (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).\n</pre>",
