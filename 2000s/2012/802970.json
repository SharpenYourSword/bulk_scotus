Decided June 25, 2012\n\n\n  The petitions for writs of certiorari are denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE ALITO respecting the denial of the\npetitions for writs of certiorari.\n  A large white cross has stood atop Mount Soledad in\nSan Diego, California, since 1954 as a memorial to our\nNation’s war veterans. The city of San Diego was pre-\nviously enjoined under the California Constitution from\ndisplaying the cross or transferring, for the purpose of\nprotecting the cross, the property on which the Mount\nSoledad Veterans Memorial stands. See Trunk v. San\nDiego, 629 F. 3d 1099, 11031104 (CA9 2011) (describ-\ning prior litigation); see also San Diegans for Mt. Soledad\nNat. War Memorial v. Paulson, 548 U. S. 1301, 1302 (2006)\n(KENNEDY, J., in chambers) (same). In 2006, Congress\nexercised its power of eminent domain and took title to the\nproperty in order to “preserve a historically significant\nwar memorial.” Act of Aug. 14, §2(a), 120 Stat. 770. After\nthe Federal Government took possession, the Ninth Cir-\ncuit held in the decision below that “the Memorial, pres-\nently configured and as a whole, primarily conveys a\nmessage of government endorsement of religion that vio-\nlates the Establishment Clause.” 629 F. 3d, at 1125.\n2       MOUNT SOLEDAD MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION v.\n\n                        TRUNK\n\n                  Statement of ALITO, J. \n\n\n   This Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence is un-\ndoubtedly in need of clarity, see Utah Highway Patrol\nAssn. v. American Atheists, Inc., 565 U. S. __, __ (2011)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op.,\nat 17), and the constitutionality of the Mount Soledad\nVeterans Memorial is a question of substantial impor-\ntance. We considered a related question two Terms ago\nin Salazar v. Buono, 559 U. S. __ (2010), which concerned\na large white cross that was originally erected on public\nland. Although “[t]he cross is of course the preeminent\nsymbol of Christianity,” id., at __ (ALITO, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3), we noted\nthat “[t]he goal of avoiding governmental endorsement\n[of religion] does not require eradication of all religious\nsymbols in the public realm. . . . The Constitution does not\noblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of\nreligion’s role in society,” id., at ____ (plurality opinion of\nKENNEDY, J., joined in full by ROBERTS, C. J., and in part\nby ALITO, J.) (slip op., at 1415). The demolition of the\ncross at issue in that case would have been “interpreted by\nsome as an arresting symbol of a Government that is not\nneutral but hostile on matters of religion and is bent on\neliminating from all public places and symbols any trace\nof our country’s religious heritage.” Id., at __ (opinion of\nALITO, J.) (slip op., at 4).\n   In that case, we were not required to decide whether the\nEstablishment Clause would have required the demolition\nof the cross if the land on which it was built had remained\nin government hands. Instead, Congress was ultimately\nable to devise a solution that was “true to the spirit of\npractical accommodation that has made the United States\na Nation of unparalleled pluralism and religious toler-\nance.” Id., at __ (slip op., at 1).\n   The current petitions come to us in an interlocutory\nposture. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the\nDistrict Court to fashion an appropriate remedy, and, in\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Because no\nfinal judgment has been rendered and it remains unclear\nprecisely what action the Federal Government will be\nrequired to take, I agree with the Court’s decision to deny\nthe petitions for certiorari. See, e.g., Locomotive Firemen\nv. Bangor & Aroostook R. Co., 389 U. S. 327, 328 (1967)\n(per curiam) (denying petition for certiorari because “the\nCourt of Appeals [had] remanded the case” and thus it was\n“not yet ripe for review by this Court”); see also E. Gress-\nman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett,\nSupreme Court Practice 280 (9th ed. 2007) (hereinaf-\nter Stern & Gressman). Our denial, of course, does not\namount to a ruling on the merits, and the Federal Gov-\nernment is free to raise the same issue in a later petition\nfollowing entry of a final judgment. See, e.g., Hughes Tool\nCo. v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 409 U.
