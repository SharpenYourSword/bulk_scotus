STEVE BULLOCK, ATTORNEY\n\n         GENERAL OF MONTANA, ET AL. \n\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                  COURT OF MONTANA\n\n              No. 11\u20131179. Decided June 25, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  A Montana state law provides that a \u201ccorporation may\nnot make . . . an expenditure in connection with a candi-\ndate or a political committee that supports or opposes a\ncandidate or a political party.\u201d Mont. Code Ann. \u00a713\u2013\n35\u2013227(1) (2011). The Montana Supreme Court rejected\npetitioners\u2019 claim that this statute violates the First\nAmendment. 2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P. 3d 1.\nIn Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, this\nCourt struck down a similar federal law, holding that\n\u201cpolitical speech does not lose First Amendment protection\nsimply because its source is a corporation.\u201d 558 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 26) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). The question presented in this case is whether the\nholding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state\nlaw. There can be no serious doubt that it does. See U. S.\nConst., Art. VI, cl. 2. Montana\u2019s arguments in support of\nthe judgment below either were already rejected in Citi-\nzens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.\n  The petition for certiorari is granted. The judgment of\nthe Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Decided June 25, 2012\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG, JUS-\nTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n   In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the\nCourt concluded that \u201cindependent expenditures, includ\u00ad\ning those made by corporations, do not give rise to corrup\u00ad\ntion or the appearance of corruption.\u201d 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 42). I disagree with the Court\u2019s hold-\ning for the reasons expressed in Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent\nin that case. As Justice Stevens explained, \u201ctechnically in\u00ad\ndependent expenditures can be corrupting in much the\nsame way as direct contributions.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n67\u201368). Indeed, Justice Stevens recounted a \u201csubstantial\nbody of evidence\u201d suggesting that \u201c[m]any corporate inde\u00ad\npendent expenditures . . . had become essentially inter\u00ad\nchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to\ngenerate quid pro quo arrangements.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 64\u201365).\n   Moreover, even if I were to accept Citizens United, this\nCourt\u2019s legal conclusion should not bar the Montana Su\u00ad\npreme Court\u2019s finding, made on the record before it, that\nindependent expenditures by corporations did in fact lead\nto corruption or the appearance of corruption in Montana.\nGiven the history and political landscape in Montana, that\ncourt concluded that the State had a compelling interest in\nlimiting independent expenditures by corporations. 2011\nMT 328, \u00b6\u00b6 36\u201337, 363 Mont. 220, 235\u2013236, 271 P. 3d 1,\n2   AMERICAN TRADITION PARTNERSHIP, INC. v. BULLOCK\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n36\u201337. Thus, Montana\u2019s experience, like considerable ex\u00ad\nperience elsewhere since the Court\u2019s decision in Citizens\nUnited, casts grave doubt on the Court\u2019s supposition that\nindependent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do\nso.\n  Were the matter up to me, I would vote to grant the\npetition for certiorari in order to reconsider Citizens United\nor, at least, its application in this case. But given the\nCourt\u2019s per curiam disposition, I do not see a significant\npossibility of reconsideration. Consequently, I vote in\u00ad\nstead to deny the petition.\n",
