ALVAREZ\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11\u2013210.      Argued February 22, 2012\u2014Decided June 28, 2012\nThe Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime to falsely claim receipt of mili-\n  tary decorations or medals and provides an enhanced penalty if the\n  Congressional Medal of Honor is involved. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7704 (b), (c).\n  Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had\n  received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his\n  claim that the Act is unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit reversed,\n  finding the Act invalid under the First Amendment.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 3\u221218.\n617 F. 3d 1198, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\n  and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that the Act infringes upon\n  speech protected by the First Amendment. Pp. 3\u201318.\n     (a) The Constitution \u201cdemands that content-based restrictions on\n  speech be presumed invalid . . . and that the Government bear the\n  burden of showing their constitutionality.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civ-\n  il Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656, 660.\n     Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for\n  a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity,\n  defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called \u201cfighting\n  words,\u201d child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting\n  some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to\n  prevent.\n     Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false\n  statements. The Government argues that cases such as Hustler\n  Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52, support its claim that\n  false statements have no value and hence no First Amendment pro-\n  tection. But all the Government\u2019s quotations derive from cases dis-\n2                     UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    cussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm as-\n    sociated with a false statement. In those decisions the falsity of the\n    speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Court\u2019s analysis, but neither\n    was it determinative. These prior decisions have not confronted a\n    measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing\n    more.\n       Even when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the\n    Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the\n    speech outside the First Amendment; the statement must be a know-\n    ing and reckless falsehood. See New York Times v. Sullivan, 376\n    U. S. 254, 280. Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that\n    limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits re-\n    covery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a dif-\n    ferent, far greater realm of discourse and expression.\n       The Government\u2019s three examples of false-speech regulation that\n    courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle\n    that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous\n    First Amendment scrutiny. The criminal prohibition of a false\n    statement made to Government officials in communications concern-\n    ing official matters, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001, does not lead to the broader\n    proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any\n    person, at any time, in any context. As for perjury statutes, perjured\n    statements lack First Amendment protection not simply because they\n    are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province\n    of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments. Finally, there\n    are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on\n    behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government\n    officer. These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or\n    speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n       While there may exist \u201csome categories of speech that have been\n    historically unprotected,\u201d but that the Court has not yet specifically\n    identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\n    the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should\n    constitute a new category. Pp. 3\u221210.\n       (b) The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on\n    this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard\n    to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain. Per-\n    mitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense\n    would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects\n    about which false statements are punishable. That governmental\n    power has no clear limiting principle. Pp. 10\u221211.\n       (c) The Court applies the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny\u201d in assessing con-\n    tent-based restrictions on protected speech. Turner Broadcasting\n    System Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 642. The Act does not satisfy that\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nscrutiny. While the Government\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity\nof the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the First Amendment re-\nquires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction im-\nposed and the injury to be prevented. Here, that link has not been\nshown. The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim\nthat the public\u2019s general perception of military awards is diluted by\nfalse claims such as those made by respondent. And it has not\nshown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule re-\nspondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to\nachieve its interest.\n   In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected\nspeech, the restriction must be the \u201cleast restrictive means among\navailable, effective alternatives.\u201d Ashcroft, 542 U. S., at 666. Here,\nthe Government could likely protect the integrity of the military\nawards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible\nand searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have al-\nready done. Pp. 12\u221218.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that because\nthe Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate\nconstitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates\nthe First Amendment. Pp. 1\u221210.\n   (a) In determining whether a statute violates the First Amend-\nment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit be-\ntween statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness\nof the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature\nand importance of the provision\u2019s countervailing objectives, the ex-\ntent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and\nwhether there are other, less restrictive alternatives. \u201cIntermediate\nscrutiny\u201d describes this approach. Since false factual statements are\nless likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribu-\ntion to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good\nreason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten\nspeech-related harm, such an approach is applied here. Pp. 1\u22123.\n   (b) The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual\nstatements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that\nthey be taken as true. Although the Court has frequently said or im-\nplied that false factual statements enjoy little First Amendment pro-\ntection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340, those\nstatements cannot be read to mean \u201cno protection at all.\u201d False fac-\ntual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.\nMoreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false\nstatement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements,\nthereby \u201cchilling\u201d a kind of speech that lies at the First Amendment\u2019s\nheart. See id., at 340\u2212341. And the pervasiveness of false factual\n4                     UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to\n    prosecute falsity without more. Those who are unpopular may fear\n    that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.\n       Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines mak-\n    ing the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they\n    tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their\n    application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specif-\n    ic harm to identifiable victims. The Act lacks any such limiting fea-\n    tures. Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods\n    about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the\n    speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it\n    creates a significant risk of First Amendment harm. Pp. 3\u22128.\n       (c) The Act nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks to\n    protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life\n    for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country\u2019s recogni-\n    tion of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. P. 8.\n       (d) It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Gov-\n    ernment\u2019s objective in less burdensome ways. The First Amendment\n    risks flowing from the Act\u2019s breadth of coverage could be diminished\n    or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute\n    that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm\n    or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where\n    such lies are likely to cause harm.

XAVIER ALVAREZ\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 28, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY announced the judgment of the\n Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\njoin.\n   Lying was his habit. Xavier Alvarez, the respondent\nhere, lied when he said that he played hockey for the\nDetroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from\nMexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Con-\ngressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new\nground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the\nStolen Valor Act of 2005. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704.\n   In 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as\na board member of the Three Valley Water District Board.\nThe board is a governmental entity with headquarters in\nClaremont, California. He introduced himself as follows:\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001.\nBack in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of\nHonor. I got wounded many times by the same guy.\u201d 617\nF. 3d 1198, 1201\u20131202 (CA9 2010). None of this was true.\nFor all the record shows, respondent\u2019s statements were\nbut a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him.\nThe statements do not seem to have been made to secure\n2               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nemployment or financial benefits or admission to privileges\nreserved for those who had earned the Medal.\n  Respondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act\nfor lying about the Congressional Medal of Honor at the\nmeeting. The United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California rejected his claim that the statute is\ninvalid under the First Amendment. Respondent pleaded\nguilty to one count, reserving the right to appeal on his\nFirst Amendment claim. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by a divided\npanel, found the Act invalid under the First Amendment\nand reversed the conviction. Id., at 1218. With further\nopinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges,\nrehearing en banc was denied. 638 F. 3d 666 (2011). This\nCourt granted certiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n  After certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case,\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nalso in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act consti-\ntutional. United States v. Strandlof, 667 F. 3d 1146\n(2012). So there is now a conflict in the Courts of Appeals\non the question of the Act\u2019s validity.\n  This is the second case in two Terms requiring the Court\nto consider speech that can disparage, or attempt to steal,\nhonor that belongs to those who fought for this Nation in\nbattle. See Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (hateful\nprotests directed at the funeral of a serviceman who died\nin Iraq). Here the statement that the speaker held the\nMedal was an intended, undoubted lie.\n  It is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago,\nestablished an award so the Nation can hold in its high-\nest respect and esteem those who, in the course of carrying\nout the \u201csupreme and noble duty of contributing to the\ndefense of the rights and honor of the nation,\u201d Selective\nDraft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366, 390 (1918), have acted\nwith extraordinary honor. And it should be uncontested\nthat this is a legitimate Government objective, indeed a\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmost valued national aspiration and purpose. This does\nnot end the inquiry, however. Fundamental constitutional\nprinciples require that laws enacted to honor the brave\nmust be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution\nfor which they fought.\n   The Government contends the criminal prohibition is\na proper means to further its purpose in creating and\nawarding the Medal. When content-based speech regula-\ntion is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required.\nStatutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged\nby the sometimes inconvenient principles of the First\nAmendment. By this measure, the statutory provisions\nunder which respondent was convicted must be held inva-\nlid, and his conviction must be set aside.\n                            I\n  Respondent\u2019s claim to hold the Congressional Medal of\nHonor was false. There is no room to argue about in-\nterpretation or shades of meaning. On this premise, re-\nspondent violated \u00a7704(b); and, because the lie concerned\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, he was subject to an\nenhanced penalty under subsection (c). Those statutory\nprovisions are as follows:\n        \u201c(b) FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT RECEIPT OF MILITARY\n    DECORATIONS OR MEDALS.\u2013\u2013Whoever falsely repre-\n    sents himself or herself, verbally or in writing, to have\n    been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by\n    Congress for the Armed Forces of the United States\n    . . . shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not\n    more than six months, or both.\n        \u201c(c) ENHANCED PENALTY FOR OFFENSES INVOLVING\n    CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR.\u2013\u2013\n        \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2013\u2013If a decoration or medal involved\n    in an offense under subsection (a) or (b) is a Congres-\n    sional Medal of Honor, in lieu of the punishment provided\n    in that subsection, the offender shall be fined under\n4                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n    this title, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\u201d\n  Respondent challenges the statute as a content-based\nsuppression of pure speech, speech not falling within any\nof the few categories of expression where content-based\nregulation is permissible. The Government defends the\nstatute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose\nof the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are\ncompromised and frustrated by the false statements the\nstatute prohibits. It argues that false statements \u201chave\nno First Amendment value in themselves,\u201d and thus \u201care\nprotected only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully\nprotected speech.\u201d Brief for United States 18, 20. Al-\nthough the statute covers respondent\u2019s speech, the Gov-\nernment argues that it leaves breathing room for pro-\ntected speech, for example speech which might criticize\nthe idea of the Medal or the importance of the military.\nThe Government\u2019s arguments cannot suffice to save the\nstatute.\n                             II\n  \u201c[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means\nthat government has no power to restrict expression be-\ncause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its\ncontent.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union, 535\nU. S. 564, 573 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nAs a result, the Constitution \u201cdemands that content-based\nrestrictions on speech be presumed invalid . . . and that\nthe Government bear the burden of showing their consti-\ntutionality.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union,\n542 U. S. 656, 660 (2004).\n  In light of the substantial and expansive threats to free\nexpression posed by content-based restrictions, this Court\nhas rejected as \u201cstartling and dangerous\u201d a \u201cfree-floating\ntest for First Amendment coverage . . . [based on] an\nad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.\u201d\nUnited States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             5\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nat 7). Instead, content-based restrictions on speech have\nbeen permitted, as a general matter, only when confined\nto the few \u201c \u2018historic and traditional categories [of expres-\nsion] long familiar to the bar,\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (KENNEDY,\nJ., concurring in judgment)). Among these categories are\nadvocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless\naction, see Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969)\n(per curiam); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15 (1973); defamation, see, e.g., New York Times Co.\nv. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964) (providing substantial\nprotection for speech about public figures); Gertz v. Robert\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (imposing some limits on\nliability for defaming a private figure); speech integral to\ncriminal conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage &\nIce Co., 336 U. S. 490 (1949); so-called \u201cfighting words,\u201d\nsee Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942);\nchild pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747\n(1982); fraud, see Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia\nCitizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976);\ntrue threats, see Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705\n(1969) (per curiam); and speech presenting some grave\nand imminent threat the government has the power to\nprevent, see Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S.\n697, 716 (1931), although a restriction under the last\ncategory is most difficult to sustain, see New York Times\nCo. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam).\nThese categories have a historical foundation in the\nCourt\u2019s free speech tradition. The vast realm of free\nspeech and thought always protected in our tradition can\nstill thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those\ncategories and rules.\n   Absent from those few categories where the law allows\ncontent-based regulation of speech is any general excep-\ntion to the First Amendment for false statements. This\n6               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ncomports with the common understanding that some false\nstatements are inevitable if there is to be an open and\nvigorous expression of views in public and private con-\nversation, expression the First Amendment seeks to guar-\nantee. See Sullivan, supra, at 271 (\u201cTh[e] erroneous\nstatement is inevitable in free debate\u201d).\n   The Government disagrees with this proposition. It\ncites language from some of this Court\u2019s precedents to\nsupport its contention that false statements have no value\nand hence no First Amendment protection. See also Brief\nfor Eugene Volokh et al. as Amici Curiae 2\u201311. These\nisolated statements in some earlier decisions do not sup-\nport the Government\u2019s submission that false statements,\nas a general rule, are beyond constitutional protection.\nThat conclusion would take the quoted language far from\nits proper context. For instance, the Court has stated\n\u201c[f]alse statements of fact are particularly valueless [be-\ncause] they interfere with the truth-seeking function of\nthe marketplace of ideas,\u201d Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Fal-\nwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52 (1988), and that false statements\n\u201care not protected by the First Amendment in the same\nmanner as truthful statements,\u201d Brown v. Hartlage, 456\nU. S. 45, 60\u201361 (1982). See also, e.g., Virginia Bd. of\nPharmacy, supra, at 771 (\u201cUntruthful speech, commercial\nor otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake\u201d);\nHerbert v. Lando, 441 U.

In those decisions the falsity of\nthe speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but\nneither was it determinative. The Court has never en-\ndorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that\nfalse statements receive no First Amendment protection.\nOur prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like\nthe Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing\nmore.\n  Even when considering some instances of defamation\nand fraud, moreover, the Court has been careful to in-\nstruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the\nspeech outside the First Amendment. The statement must\nbe a knowing or reckless falsehood. See Sullivan, supra,\nat 280 (prohibiting recovery of damages for a defamatory\nfalsehood made about a public official unless the state-\nment was made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with\nreckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d); see\nalso Garrison, supra, at 73 (\u201c[E]ven when the utterance is\nfalse, the great principles of the Constitution which secure\nfreedom of expression . . . preclude attaching adverse\nconsequences to any except the knowing or reckless false-\nhood\u201d); Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associ-\nates, Inc., 538 U. S. 600, 620 (2003) (\u201cFalse statement\nalone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud liability\u201d).\n  The Government thus seeks to use this principle for a\nnew purpose. It seeks to convert a rule that limits liability\neven in defamation cases where the law permits recovery\nfor tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a\ndifferent, far greater realm of discourse and expression.\nThat inverts the rationale for the exception. The require-\nments of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the\ntruth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation\ncases exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule de-\nsigned to tolerate certain speech ought not blossom to\nbecome a rationale for a rule restricting it.\n8                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   The Government then gives three examples of regula-\ntions on false speech that courts generally have found per-\nmissible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false state-\nment made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001;\nsecond, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibi-\ntions on the false representation that one is speaking as a\nGovernment official or on behalf of the Government, see,\ne.g., \u00a7912; \u00a7709. These restrictions, however, do not estab-\nlish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements\nare exempt from exacting First Amendment scrutiny.\n   The federal statute prohibiting false statements to\nGovernment officials punishes \u201cwhoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or\njudicial branch of the Government . . . makes any mate-\nrially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or repre-\nsentation.\u201d \u00a71001. Section 1001\u2019s prohibition on false\nstatements made to Government officials, in communica-\ntions concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader\nproposition that false statements are unprotected when\nmade to any person, at any time, in any context.\n   The same point can be made about what the Court has\nconfirmed is the \u201cunquestioned constitutionality of perjury\nstatutes,\u201d both the federal statute, \u00a71623, and its state-law\nequivalents. United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 54\n(1978). See also Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U. S.\n36, 51, n. 10 (1961). It is not simply because perjured\nstatements are false that they lack First Amendment\nprotection. Perjured testimony \u201cis at war with justice\u201d\nbecause it can cause a court to render a \u201cjudgment not\nresting on truth.\u201d In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 227 (1945).\nPerjury undermines the function and province of the law\nand threatens the integrity of judgments that are the\nbasis of the legal system. See United States v. Dunnigan,\n507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (\u201cTo uphold the integrity of our\ntrial system . . . the constitutionality of perjury statutes is\nunquestioned\u201d). Unlike speech in other contexts, testi-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to\nremind the witness that his or her statements will be the\nbasis for official governmental action, action that often\naffects the rights and liberties of others. Sworn testimony\nis quite distinct from lies not spoken under oath and sim-\nply intended to puff up oneself.\n   Statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is\nspeaking on behalf of the Government, or that prohibit im-\npersonating a Government officer, also protect the in-\ntegrity of Government processes, quite apart from merely\nrestricting false speech. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a7912, for ex-\nample, prohibits impersonating an officer or employee of\nthe United States. Even if that statute may not require\nproving an \u201cactual financial or property loss\u201d resulting\nfrom the deception, the statute is itself confined to \u201cmain-\ntain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of . . . gov-\nernment . . . service itself.\u201d United States v. Lepowitch,\n318 U. S. 702, 704 (1943) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). The same can be said for prohibitions on the unau-\nthorized use of the names of federal agencies such as the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation in a manner calculated to\nconvey that the communication is approved, see \u00a7709, or\nusing words such as \u201cFederal\u201d or \u201cUnited States\u201d in the\ncollection of private debts in order to convey that the\ncommunication has official authorization, see \u00a7712. These\nexamples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or\nspeech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n   As our law and tradition show, then, there are instances\nin which the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is\nprotected. Some false speech may be prohibited even if\nanalogous true speech could not be. This opinion does not\nimply that any of these targeted prohibitions are somehow\nvulnerable. But it also rejects the notion that false speech\nshould be in a general category that is presumptively\nunprotected.\n   Although the First Amendment stands against any\n10               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n\u201cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of\nspeech outside the scope of the First Amendment,\u201d Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), the Court has\nacknowledged that perhaps there exist \u201csome categories of\nspeech that have been historically unprotected . . . but\nhave not yet been specifically identified or discussed . . . in\nour case law.\u201d Ibid. Before exempting a category of\nspeech from the normal prohibition on content-based re-\nstrictions, however, the Court must be presented with \u201cper-\nsuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is\npart of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of\nproscription,\u201d Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4). The Government\nhas not demonstrated that false statements generally\nshould constitute a new category of unprotected speech on\nthis basis.\n                               III\n  The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on free-\ndom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the\nreasons for the Law\u2019s distrust of content-based speech\nprohibitions.\n  The Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement\nmade at any time, in any place, to any person. It can be\nassumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical per-\nformance. See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S.\n1, 20 (1990) (recognizing that some statements nominally\npurporting to contain false facts in reality \u201ccannot reason-\nably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an indi-\nvidual\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\nStill, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the\nstatute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here\nthe lie was made in a public meeting, but the statute\nwould apply with equal force to personal, whispered con-\nversations within a home. The statute seeks to control\nand suppress all false statements on this one subject in\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

And it does so en-\ntirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the\npurpose of material gain. See San Francisco Arts & Ath-\nletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522,\n539\u2013540 (1987) (prohibiting a nonprofit corporation from\nexploiting the \u201ccommercial magnetism\u201d of the word \u201cOlym-\npic\u201d when organizing an athletic competition (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   Permitting the government to decree this speech to be\na criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or\nmade in a barely audible whisper, would endorse govern-\nment authority to compile a list of subjects about which\nfalse statements are punishable. That governmental\npower has no clear limiting principle. Our constitutional\ntradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania\u2019s\nMinistry of Truth. See G. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four\n(1949) (Centennial ed. 2003). Were this law to be sus-\ntained, there could be an endless list of subjects the Na-\ntional Government or the States could single out. Where\nfalse claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys\nor other valuable considerations, say offers of employment,\nit is well established that the Government may restrict\nspeech without affronting the First Amendment. See, e.g.,\nVirginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771 (noting that\nfraudulent speech generally falls outside the protections of\nthe First Amendment). But the Stolen Valor Act is not so\nlimited in its reach. Were the Court to hold that the in-\nterest in truthful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a\nban on speech, absent any evidence that the speech was\nused to gain a material advantage, it would give govern-\nment a broad censorial power unprecedented in this\nCourt\u2019s cases or in our constitutional tradition. The mere\npotential for the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill\nthe First Amendment cannot permit if free speech,\nthought, and discourse are to remain a foundation of our\nfreedom.\n12              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                            IV\n  The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act\nconflicts with free speech principles. But even when ex-\namined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act\ncannot survive. In assessing content-based restrictions\non protected speech, the Court has not adopted a free-\nwheeling approach, see Stevens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7) (\u201cThe First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech\ndoes not extend only to categories of speech that survive\nan ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits\u201d),\nbut rather has applied the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny.\u201d\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,\n642 (1994). Although the objectives the Government seeks\nto further by the statute are not without significance, the\nCourt must, and now does, find the Act does not satisfy\nexacting scrutiny.\n  The Government is correct when it states military med-\nals \u201cserve the important public function of recognizing and\nexpressing gratitude for acts of heroism and sacrifice in\nmilitary service,\u201d and also \u201c \u2018foste[r] morale, mission ac-\ncomplishment and esprit de corps\u2019 among service mem-\nbers.\u201d Brief for United States 37, 38. General George\nWashington observed that an award for valor would \u201ccher-\nish a virtuous ambition in . . . soldiers, as well as foster\nand encourage every species of military merit.\u201d General\nOrders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh on the\nHudson, 1782\u20131783 (Aug. 7, 1782), p. 30 (E. Boynton ed.\n1883). Time has not diminished this idea. In periods of\nwar and peace alike public recognition of valor and noble\nsacrifice by men and women in uniform reinforces the\npride and national resolve that the military relies upon to\nfulfill its mission.\n  These interests are related to the integrity of the mili-\ntary honors system in general, and the Congressional\nMedal of Honor in particular. Although millions have\nserved with brave resolve, the Medal, which is the highest\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Established in 1861, the Medal\nis reserved for those who have distinguished themselves\n\u201cconspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of\nhis life above and beyond the call of duty.\u201d 10 U.

The stories of\nthose who earned the Medal inspire and fascinate, from\nDakota Meyer who in 2009 drove five times into the midst\nof a Taliban ambush to save 36 lives, see Curtis, President\nObama Awards Medal of Honor to Dakota Meyer, The\nWhite House Blog (Sept. 15, 2011) (all Internet materials\nas visited June 25, 2012, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file); to Desmond Doss who served as an army medic\non Okinawa and on June 5, 1945, rescued 75 fellow sol-\ndiers, and who, after being wounded, gave up his own\nplace on a stretcher so others could be taken to safety, see\nAmerica\u2019s Heroes 88\u201390 (J. Willbanks ed. 2011); to Wil-\nliam Carney who sustained multiple gunshot wounds to\nthe head, chest, legs, and arm, and yet carried the flag\nto ensure it did not touch the ground during the Union\narmy\u2019s assault on Fort Wagner in July 1863, id., at 44\u201345.\nThe rare acts of courage the Medal celebrates led Presi-\ndent Truman to say he would \u201crather have that medal\nround my neck than . . . be president of the United States.\u201d\nTruman Gives No. 1 Army Medal to 15 Heroes, Washing-\nton Post, Oct. 13, 1945, p. 5. The Government\u2019s interest in\nprotecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond\nquestion.\n   But to recite the Government\u2019s compelling interests is\nnot to end the matter. The First Amendment requires\nthat the Government\u2019s chosen restriction on the speech\nat issue be \u201cactually necessary\u201d to achieve its interest. En-\ntertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U.

Although appearing to concede that \u201can\nisolated misrepresentation by itself would not tarnish the\nmeaning of military honors,\u201d the Government asserts it is\n\u201ccommon sense that false representations have the ten-\ndency to dilute the value and meaning of military awards,\u201d\nBrief for United States 49, 54. It must be acknowledged\nthat when a pretender claims the Medal to be his own, the\nlie might harm the Government by demeaning the high\npurpose of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms,\nand creating the appearance that the Medal is awarded\nmore often than is true. Furthermore, the lie may offend\nthe true holders of the Medal. From one perspective it in-\nsults their bravery and high principles when falsehood\nputs them in the unworthy company of a pretender.\n   Yet these interests do not satisfy the Government\u2019s\nheavy burden when it seeks to regulate protected speech.\nSee United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,\n529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). The Government points to no\nevidence to support its claim that the public\u2019s general\nperception of military awards is diluted by false claims\nsuch as those made by Alvarez. Cf. Entertainment Mer-\nchants Assn., supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 12\u201313) (analyz-\ning and rejecting the findings of research psychologists\ndemonstrating the causal link between violent video\ngames and harmful effects on children).

This general\nproposition is sound, even if true holders of the Medal\nmight experience anger and frustration.\n   The lack of a causal link between the Government\u2019s\nstated interest and the Act is not the only way in which\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          15\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nthe Act is not actually necessary to achieve the Govern-\nment\u2019s stated interest. The Government has not shown,\nand cannot show, why counterspeech would not suffice to\nachieve its interest. The facts of this case indicate that\nthe dynamics of free speech, of counterspeech, of refuta-\ntion, can overcome the lie. Respondent lied at a public\nmeeting. Even before the FBI began investigating him for\nhis false statements \u201cAlvarez was perceived as a phony,\u201d\n617 F. 3d, at 1211. Once the lie was made public, he was\nridiculed online, see Brief for Respondent 3, his actions\nwere reported in the press, see Ortega, Alvarez Again\nDenies Claim, Ontario, CA, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin\n(Sept. 27, 2007), and a fellow board member called for his\nresignation, see, e.g., Bigham, Water District Rep Re-\nquests Alvarez Resign in Wake of False Medal Claim,\nSan Bernardino Cty., CA, The Sun (May 21, 2008). There\nis good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall\nother false claimants. See Brief for Reporters Committee\nfor Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 30\u201333\n(listing numerous examples of public exposure of false\nclaimants). Indeed, the outrage and contempt expressed\nfor respondent\u2019s lies can serve to reawaken and reinforce\nthe public\u2019s respect for the Medal, its recipients, and its\nhigh purpose. The acclaim that recipients of the Congres-\nsional Medal of Honor receive also casts doubt on the\nproposition that the public will be misled by the claims of\ncharlatans or become cynical of those whose heroic deeds\nearned them the Medal by right. See, e.g., Well Done,\nWashington Post, Feb. 5, 1943, p. 8 (reporting on Pres-\nident Roosevelt\u2019s awarding the Congressional Medal of\nHonor to Maj. Gen. Alexander Vandegrift); Devroy, Medal\nof Honor Given to 2 Killed in Somalia, Washington Post,\nMay 24, 1994, p. A6 (reporting on President Clinton\u2019s\nawarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to two special\nforces soldiers killed during operations in Somalia).\n   The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is\ntrue. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The\n16              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nresponse to the unreasoned is the rational; to the unin-\nformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple\ntruth. See Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cIf there be time to expose\nthrough discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert\nthe evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be ap-\nplied is more speech, not enforced silence\u201d). The theory of\nour Constitution is \u201cthat the best test of truth is the power\nof the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of\nthe market,\u201d Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630\n(1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The First Amendment\nitself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like,\nand for good reason. Freedom of speech and thought flows\nnot from the beneficence of the state but from the inalien-\nable rights of the person. And suppression of speech by\nthe government can make exposure of falsity more diffi-\ncult, not less so. Society has the right and civic duty to\nengage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These ends\nare not well served when the government seeks to orches-\ntrate public discussion through content-based mandates.\n   Expressing its concern that counterspeech is insuf-\nficient, the Government responds that because \u201csome\nmilitary records have been lost . . . some claims [are] un-\nverifiable,\u201d Brief for United States 50. This proves little,\nhowever; for without verifiable records, successful crimi-\nnal prosecution under the Act would be more difficult in\nany event. So, in cases where public refutation will not\nserve the Government\u2019s interest, the Act will not either.\nIn addition, the Government claims that \u201cmany [false\nclaims] will remain unchallenged.\u201d Id., at 55. The Gov-\nernment provides no support for the contention. And in\nany event, in order to show that public refutation is not an\nadequate alternative, the Government must demonstrate\nthat unchallenged claims undermine the public\u2019s percep-\ntion of the military and the integrity of its awards system.\nThis showing has not been made.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the\nMedal who had heard of Alvarez\u2019s false claims would have\nbeen fully vindicated by the community\u2019s expression of\noutrage, showing as it did the Nation\u2019s high regard for the\nMedal. The same can be said for the Government\u2019s inter-\nest. The American people do not need the assistance of a\ngovernment prosecution to express their high regard for\nthe special place that military heroes hold in our tradi-\ntion. Only a weak society needs government protection or\nintervention before it pursues its resolve to preserve the\ntruth. Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its\nvindication.\n   In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate\nprotected speech, the restriction must be the \u201cleast restric-\ntive means among available, effective alternatives.\u201d Ash-\ncroft, 542 U. S., at 666. There is, however, at least one\nless speech-restrictive means by which the Government\ncould likely protect the integrity of the military awards\nsystem. A Government-created database could list Con-\ngressional Medal of Honor winners. Were a database\naccessible through the Internet, it would be easy to verify\nand expose false claims. It appears some private individ-\nuals have already created databases similar to this,\nsee Brief for Respondent 25, and at least one data-\nbase of past winners is online and fully searchable, see\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society, Full Archive,\nhttp://www.cmohs.org/recipient-archive.php. The Solicitor\nGeneral responds that although Congress and the De-\npartment of Defense investigated the feasibility of estab-\nlishing a database in 2008, the Government \u201cconcluded\nthat such a database would be impracticable and insuf-\nficiently comprehensive.\u201d Brief for United States 55.\nWithout more explanation, it is difficult to assess the Gov-\nernment\u2019s claim, especially when at least one database of\nCongressional Medal of Honor winners already exists.\n   The Government may have responses to some of these\ncriticisms, but there has been no clear showing of the\n18              UNITED STATES v.

Rather, I base that conclusion upon the fact that the\nstatute works First Amendment harm, while the Govern-\nment can achieve its legitimate objectives in less restric-\ntive ways.\n                                I\n   In determining whether a statute violates the First\nAmendment, this Court has often found it appropriate to\nexamine the fit between statutory ends and means. In\ndoing so, it has examined speech-related harms, justifica-\ntions, and potential alternatives. In particular, it has\ntaken account of the seriousness of the speech-related\nharm the provision will likely cause, the nature and im-\nportance of the provision\u2019s countervailing objectives, the\nextent to which the provision will tend to achieve those\nobjectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive\nways of doing so. Ultimately the Court has had to deter-\nmine whether the statute works speech-related harm that\nis out of proportion to its justifications.\n   Sometimes the Court has referred to this approach as\n\u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d sometimes as \u201cproportionality\u201d\n2               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nreview, sometimes as an examination of \u201cfit,\u201d and some-\ntimes it has avoided the application of any label at all.\nSee, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512\nU. S. 622, 641\u2013652 (1994) (intermediate scrutiny); Randall\nv. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 249 (2006) (plurality opinion)\n(proportionality); Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.\nv. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (requiring a \u201cfit\u201d be-\ntween means and ends that is \u201c \u2018in proportion to the in-\nterest served\u2019 \u201d); In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 203 (1982)\n(\u201c[I]nterference with speech must be in proportion to the\n[substantial governmental] interest served\u201d); Pickering v.\nBoard of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,\n391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968).\n   Regardless of the label, some such approach is necessary\nif the First Amendment is to offer proper protection in\nthe many instances in which a statute adversely affects\nconstitutionally protected interests but warrants neither\nnear-automatic condemnation (as \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d implies)\nnor near-automatic approval (as is implicit in \u201crational\nbasis\u201d review). See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System,\nInc., supra, at 641\u2013652 (\u201cmust-carry\u201d cable regulations);\nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n\nof N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980) (nonmisleading com-\nmercial speech); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433\u2013\n434 (1992) (election regulation); Pickering, supra, at 568\n(government employee speech); United States v. O\u2019Brien,\n391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968) (application of generally appli-\ncable laws to expressive conduct). I have used the term\n\u201cproportionality\u201d to describe this approach.

Shrink\nMissouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 402\u2013403 (2000)\n(concurring opinion). But in this case, the Court\u2019s term\n\u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d describes what I think we should\ndo.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n  As the dissent points out, \u201cthere are broad areas in\nwhich any attempt by the state to penalize purportedly\nfalse speech would present a grave and unacceptable dan-\nger of suppressing truthful speech.\u201d Post, at 14. Laws\nrestricting false statements about philosophy, religion,\nhistory, the social sciences, the arts, and the like raise\nsuch concerns, and in many contexts have called for strict\nscrutiny. But this case does not involve such a law. The\ndangers of suppressing valuable ideas are lower where, as\nhere, the regulations concern false statements about easily\nverifiable facts that do not concern such subject matter.\nSuch false factual statements are less likely than are true\nfactual statements to make a valuable contribution to the\nmarketplace of ideas. And the government often has\ngood reasons to prohibit such false speech. See infra, at\n5\u20137 (listing examples of statutes and doctrines regulating\nfalse factual speech). But its regulation can nonetheless\nthreaten speech-related harms. Those circumstances lead\nme to apply what the Court has termed \u201cintermediate\nscrutiny\u201d here.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime \u201cfalsely\u201d to \u201crep-\nresen[t]\u201d oneself \u201cto have been awarded any decoration or\nmedal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of\nthe United States.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704(b). I would read the\nstatute favorably to the Government as criminalizing only\nfalse factual statements made with knowledge of their fal-\nsity and with the intent that they be taken as true. See\nStaples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994) (courts\nconstrue statutes \u201cin light of the background rules of the\ncommon law, . . . in which the requirement of some mens\nrea for a crime is firmly embedded\u201d); cf. New York Times\nCo. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279\u2013280 (1964) (First\nAmendment allows a public official to recover for defama-\n4               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntion only upon a showing of \u201c \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u201d). As so in-\nterpreted the statute covers only lies. But although this\ninterpretation diminishes the extent to which the statute\nendangers First Amendment values, it does not eliminate\nthe threat.\n   I must concede, as the Government points out, that this\nCourt has frequently said or implied that false factual\nstatements enjoy little First Amendment protection. See,\ne.g., BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S. 516, 531 (2002)\n(\u201c[F]alse statements may be unprotected for their own\nsake\u201d); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52\n(1988) (\u201cFalse statements of fact are particularly value-\nless\u201d); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340\n(1974) (\u201c[T]he erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of\nconstitutional protection\u201d).\n   But these judicial statements cannot be read to mean\n\u201cno protection at all.\u201d False factual statements can serve\nuseful human objectives, for example: in social contexts,\nwhere they may prevent embarrassment, protect privacy,\nshield a person from prejudice, provide the sick with com-\nfort, or preserve a child\u2019s innocence; in public contexts,\nwhere they may stop a panic or otherwise preserve calm in\nthe face of danger; and even in technical, philosophical,\nand scientific contexts, where (as Socrates\u2019 methods sug-\ngest) examination of a false statement (even if made delib-\nerately to mislead) can promote a form of thought that\nultimately helps realize the truth. See, e.g., 638 F. 3d\n666, 673\u2013675 (CA9 2011) (Kozinski, J., concurring in denial\nof rehearing en banc) (providing numerous examples); S.\nBok, Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life (1999)\n(same); New York Times Co., supra, at 279, n. 19 (\u201cEven a\nfalse statement may be deemed to make a valuable contri-\nbution to public debate, since it brings about \u2018the clearer\nperception and livelier impression of truth, produced by\nits collision with error\u2019 \u201d (quoting J. Mill, On Liberty 15\n(Blackwell ed. 1947))).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Moreover, as the Court has often said, the threat of\ncriminal prosecution for making a false statement can\ninhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby\n\u201cchilling\u201d a kind of speech that lies at the First Amend-\nment\u2019s heart. See, e.g., Gertz, supra, at 340\u2013341. Hence,\nthe Court emphasizes mens rea requirements that provide\n\u201cbreathing room\u201d for more valuable speech by reducing an\nhonest speaker\u2019s fear that he may accidentally incur liabil-\nity for speaking.\n   Further, the pervasiveness of false statements, made\nfor better or for worse motives, made thoughtlessly or de-\nliberately, made with or without accompanying harm,\nprovides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to\nprosecute falsity without more. And those who are un-\npopular may fear that the government will use that\nweapon selectively, say by prosecuting a pacifist who sup-\nports his cause by (falsely) claiming to have been a war\nhero, while ignoring members of other political groups who\nmight make similar false claims.\n   I also must concede that many statutes and common-\nlaw doctrines make the utterance of certain kinds of false\nstatements unlawful. Those prohibitions, however, tend to\nbe narrower than the statute before us, in that they limit\nthe scope of their application, sometimes by requiring\nproof of specific harm to identifiable victims; sometimes by\nspecifying that the lies be made in contexts in which a\ntangible harm to others is especially likely to occur; and\nsometimes by limiting the prohibited lies to those that are\nparticularly likely to produce harm.\n   Fraud statutes, for example, typically require proof of a\nmisrepresentation that is material, upon which the victim\nrelied, and which caused actual injury. See Restatement\n(Second) of Torts \u00a7525 (1976). Defamation statutes focus\nupon statements of a kind that harm the reputation of\nanother or deter third parties from association or dealing\nwith the victim. See id., \u00a7\u00a7558, 559. Torts involving the\n6                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress (like torts in-\nvolving placing a victim in a false light) concern falsehoods\nthat tend to cause harm to a specific victim of an emotional-,\ndignitary-, or privacy-related kind. See id., \u00a7652E.\n  Perjury statutes prohibit a particular set of false state-\nments\u2014those made under oath\u2014while requiring a show-\ning of materiality. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71621. Statutes\nforbidding lying to a government official (not under oath)\nare typically limited to circumstances where a lie is likely\nto work particular and specific harm by interfering with\nthe functioning of a government department, and those\nstatutes also require a showing of materiality. See, e.g.,\n\u00a71001.\n  Statutes prohibiting false claims of terrorist attacks, or\nother lies about the commission of crimes or catastrophes,\nrequire proof that substantial public harm be directly\nforeseeable, or, if not, involve false statements that are\nvery likely to bring about that harm. See, e.g., 47 CFR\n\u00a773.1217 (2011) (requiring showing of foreseeability and\nactual substantial harm); 18 U. S. C. \u00a71038(a)(1) (prohibit-\ning knowing false statements claiming that terrorist at-\ntacks have taken, are taking, or will take, place).\n  Statutes forbidding impersonation of a public official\ntypically focus on acts of impersonation, not mere speech,\nand may require a showing that, for example, someone\nwas deceived into following a \u201ccourse [of action] he would\nnot have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.\u201d United\nStates v. Lepowitch, 318 U. S. 702, 704 (1943); see, e.g.,\n\u00a7912 (liability attaches to \u201c[w]hoever falsely assumes or\npretends to be an officer or employee acting under the\nauthority of the United States . . . and acts as such\u201d (em-\nphasis added)).\n  Statutes prohibiting trademark infringement present,\nperhaps, the closest analogy to the present statute.\nTrademarks identify the source of a good; and infringe-\nment causes harm by causing confusion among potential\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Similarly, a false claim of possession of a medal\nor other honor creates confusion about who is entitled to\nwear it, thus diluting its value to those who have earned\nit, to their families, and to their country. But trademark\nstatutes are focused upon commercial and promotional\nactivities that are likely to dilute the value of a mark.\nIndeed, they typically require a showing of likely confu-\nsion, a showing that tends to assure that the feared harm\nwill in fact take place. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71114(1)(a); KP\nPermanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,\n543 U. S. 111, 117 (2004); see also San Francisco Arts &\nAthletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S.\n522, 539\u2013540, 548 (1987) (upholding statute giving the\nUnited States Olympic Committee the right to prohibit\ncertain commercial and promotional uses of the word\n\u201cOlympic\u201d).\n   While this list is not exhaustive, it is sufficient to show\nthat few statutes, if any, simply prohibit without limita-\ntion the telling of a lie, even a lie about one particular\nmatter. Instead, in virtually all these instances limita-\ntions of context, requirements of proof of injury, and the\nlike, narrow the statute to a subset of lies where specific\nharm is more likely to occur. The limitations help to make\ncertain that the statute does not allow its threat of liabil-\nity or criminal punishment to roam at large, discouraging\nor forbidding the telling of the lie in contexts where harm\nis unlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.\n   The statute before us lacks any such limiting features.\nIt may be construed to prohibit only knowing and inten-\ntional acts of deception about readily verifiable facts with-\nin the personal knowledge of the speaker, thus reducing\nthe risk that valuable speech is chilled. Supra, at 3\u20134.\nBut it still ranges very broadly. And that breadth means\nthat it creates a significant risk of First Amendment\n8                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nharm. As written, it applies in family, social, or other\nprivate contexts, where lies will often cause little harm. It\nalso applies in political contexts, where although such lies\nare more likely to cause harm, the risk of censorious se-\nlectivity by prosecutors is also high. Further, given the\npotential haziness of individual memory along with the\nlarge number of military awards covered (ranging from\nmedals for rifle marksmanship to the Congressional Medal\nof Honor), there remains a risk of chilling that is not com-\npletely eliminated by mens rea requirements; a speaker\nmight still be worried about being prosecuted for a careless\nfalse statement, even if he does not have the intent re-\nquired to render him liable. And so the prohibition may be\napplied where it should not be applied, for example, to bar\nstool braggadocio or, in the political arena, subtly but\nselectively to speakers that the Government does not like.\nThese considerations lead me to believe that the statute as\nwritten risks significant First Amendment harm.\n                              B\n  Like both the plurality and the dissent, I believe the\nstatute nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks\nto protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their\nhealth and life for their country. The statute serves this\ninterest by seeking to preserve intact the country\u2019s recog-\nnition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. To\npermit those who have not earned those honors to claim\notherwise dilutes the value of the awards. Indeed, the\nNation cannot fully honor those who have sacrificed so\nmuch for their country\u2019s honor unless those who claim to\nhave received its military awards tell the truth. Thus, the\nstatute risks harming protected interests but only in order\nto achieve a substantial countervailing objective.\n                           C\n    We must therefore ask whether it is possible substan-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntially to achieve the Government\u2019s objective in less bur-\ndensome ways. In my view, the answer to this question is\n\u201cyes.\u201d Some potential First Amendment threats can be\nalleviated by interpreting the statute to require knowledge\nof falsity, etc. Supra, at 3\u20134. But other First Amendment\nrisks, primarily risks flowing from breadth of coverage,\nremain. Supra, at 4\u20135, 7\u20138. As is indicated by the limita-\ntions on the scope of the many other kinds of statutes\nregulating false factual speech, supra, at 5\u20137, it should\nbe possible significantly to diminish or eliminate these re-\nmaining risks by enacting a similar but more finely tai-\nlored statute. For example, not all military awards are\nalike. Congress might determine that some warrant\ngreater protection than others. And a more finely tailored\nstatute might, as other kinds of statutes prohibiting false\nfactual statements have done, insist upon a showing that\nthe false statement caused specific harm or at least was\nmaterial, or focus its coverage on lies most likely to be\nharmful or on contexts where such lies are most likely to\ncause harm.\n   I recognize that in some contexts, particularly political\ncontexts, such a narrowing will not always be easy to\nachieve. In the political arena a false statement is more\nlikely to make a behavioral difference (say, by leading the\nlisteners to vote for the speaker) but at the same time\ncriminal prosecution is particularly dangerous (say, by\nradically changing a potential election result) and conse-\nquently can more easily result in censorship of speakers\nand their ideas. Thus, the statute may have to be signifi-\ncantly narrowed in its applications. Some lower courts\nhave upheld the constitutionality of roughly comparable\nbut narrowly tailored statutes in political contexts. See,\ne.g., United We Stand America, Inc. v. United We Stand,\nAmerica New York, Inc., 128 F. 3d 86, 93 (CA2 1997)\n(upholding against First Amendment challenge applica-\ntion of Lanham Act to a political organization); Treasure of\n10              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Committee to Elect Gerald D. Lostracco v. Fox, 150\nMich. App. 617, 389 N. W. 2d 446 (1986) (upholding under\nFirst Amendment statute prohibiting campaign material\nfalsely claiming that one is an incumbent). Without ex-\npressing any view on the validity of those cases, I would\nalso note, like the plurality, that in this area more accu-\nrate information will normally counteract the lie. And an\naccurate, publicly available register of military awards,\neasily obtainable by political opponents, may well ade-\nquately protect the integrity of an award against those\nwho would falsely claim to have earned it. See ante, at\n17\u201318. And so it is likely that a more narrowly tailored\nstatute combined with such information-disseminating\ndevices will effectively serve Congress\u2019 end.\n   The Government has provided no convincing explana-\ntion as to why a more finely tailored statute would not\nwork. In my own view, such a statute could significantly\nreduce the threat of First Amendment harm while permit-\nting the statute to achieve its important protective objec-\ntive. That being so, I find the statute as presently drafted\nworks disproportionate constitutional harm. It conse-\nquently fails intermediate scrutiny, and so violates the\nFirst Amendment.\n   For these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The Court strikes down the\nStolen Valor Act of 2005, which was enacted to stem an\nepidemic of false claims about military decorations. These\nlies, Congress reasonably concluded, were undermining\nour country\u2019s system of military honors and inflicting real\nharm on actual medal recipients and their families.\n   Building on earlier efforts to protect the military awards\nsystem, Congress responded to this problem by crafting a\nnarrow statute that presents no threat to the freedom of\nspeech. The statute reaches only knowingly false state-\nments about hard facts directly within a speaker\u2019s per-\nsonal knowledge. These lies have no value in and of\nthemselves, and proscribing them does not chill any\nvaluable speech.\n   By holding that the First Amendment nevertheless\nshields these lies, the Court breaks sharply from a long\nline of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does\nnot protect false factual statements that inflict real harm\nand serve no legitimate interest. I would adhere to that\nprinciple and would thus uphold the constitutionality of\nthis valuable law.\n2                    UNITED STATES v.

First,\nthe Act applies to only a narrow category of false represen-\ntations about objective facts that can almost always be\nproved or disproved with near certainty. Second, the Act\nconcerns facts that are squarely within the speaker\u2019s\npersonal knowledge.

The false statements\nproscribed by the Act are highly unlikely to be tied to\nany particular political or ideological message. In the rare\ncases where that is not so, the Act applies equally to all\nfalse statements, whether they tend to disparage or com-\nmend the Government, the military, or the system of mil-\nitary honors.\n   The Stolen Valor Act follows a long tradition of efforts to\nprotect our country\u2019s system of military honors. When\nGeorge Washington, as the commander of the Continental\nArmy, created the very first \u201chonorary badges of distinc-\ntion\u201d for service in our country\u2019s military, he established\na rigorous system to ensure that these awards would be\nreceived and worn by only the truly deserving. See Gen-\neral Orders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh\non the Hudson, 1782\u20131783, p. 35 (E. Boynton ed. 1883)\n(reprint 1973) (requiring the submission of \u201cincontest-\nible proof \u201d of \u201csingularly meritorious action\u201d to the Com-\nmander in Chief). Washington warned that anyone with the\n\u201cinsolence to assume\u201d a badge that had not actually been\nearned would be \u201cseverely punished.\u201d Id., at 34.\n   Building on this tradition, Congress long ago made it a\nfederal offense for anyone to wear, manufacture, or sell\ncertain military decorations without authorization. See\nAct of Feb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286 (codified as\namended at 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704(a)). Although this Court has\nnever opined on the constitutionality of that particular\nprovision, we have said that \u00a7702, which makes it a crime\nto wear a United States military uniform without authori-\nzation, is \u201ca valid statute on its face.\u201d Schacht v. United\nStates, 398 U. S. 58, 61 (1970).\n   Congress passed the Stolen Valor Act in response to a\nproliferation of false claims concerning the receipt of\nmilitary awards. For example, in a single year, more than\n600 Virginia residents falsely claimed to have won the\n4                   UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nMedal of Honor.3 An investigation of the 333 people listed\nin the online edition of Who\u2019s Who as having received a\ntop military award revealed that fully a third of the claims\ncould not be substantiated.4 When the Library of Con-\ngress compiled oral histories for its Veterans History\nProject, 24 of the 49 individuals who identified themselves\nas Medal of Honor recipients had not actually received\nthat award.5 The same was true of 32 individuals who\nclaimed to have been awarded the Distinguished Service\nCross and 14 who claimed to have won the Navy Cross.6\nNotorious cases brought to Congress\u2019 attention included\nthe case of a judge who falsely claimed to have been\nawarded two Medals of Honor and displayed counterfeit\nmedals in his courtroom;7 a television network\u2019s military\nconsultant who falsely claimed that he had received the\nSilver Star;8 and a former judge advocate in the Marine\nCorps who lied about receiving the Bronze Star and a\nPurple Heart.9\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 Colimore, Pinning Crime on Fake Heroes: N.

In many instances,\nthe harm is tangible in nature: Individuals often falsely\nrepresent themselves as award recipients in order to\nobtain financial or other material rewards, such as lucra-\ntive contracts and government benefits.10 An investigation\nof false claims in a single region of the United States, for\nexample, revealed that 12 men had defrauded the De-\npartment of Veterans Affairs out of more than $1.4 million\nin veteran\u2019s benefits.11 In other cases, the harm is less\ntangible, but nonetheless significant. The lies proscribed\nby the Stolen Valor Act tend to debase the distinctive\nhonor of military awards. See Stolen Valor Act of 2005,\n\u00a72, 120 Stat. 3266, note following 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704 (finding\nthat \u201c[f]raudulent claims surrounding the receipt of [mili-\ntary decorations and medals] damage the reputation and\nmeaning of such decorations and medals\u201d). And legitimate\naward recipients and their families have expressed the\nharm they endure when an imposter takes credit for he-\nroic actions that he never performed. One Medal of Honor\nrecipient described the feeling as a \u201c \u2018slap in the face\nof veterans who have paid the price and earned their\nmedals.\u2019 \u201d12\n   It is well recognized in trademark law that the prolifera-\ntion of cheap imitations of luxury goods blurs the \u201c \u2018signal\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Indeed, the first person to be prosecuted under the Stolen Valor\n\nAct apparently \u201cparlayed his medals into lucrative security consulting\ncontracts.\u201d Zambito, War Crime: FBI Targets Fake Heroes, New York\nDaily News, May 6, 2007, http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/\nwar-crime-fbi-targets-fake-heroes-article-1.249168.\n  11 Dept. of Justice, Northwest Crackdown on Fake Veterans in \u201cOper-\n\nation Stolen Valor,\u201d Sept. 21, 2007, http://www.justice.gov/usao/waw/\npress/2007/sep/operationstolenvalor.html.\n  12 Cato, High Court Tussles With False Heroics: Free Speech or Fel-\n\nony?

In much the same way, the\nproliferation of false claims about military awards blurs\nthe signal given out by the actual awards by making them\nseem more common than they really are, and this diluting\neffect harms the military by hampering its efforts to foster\nmorale and esprit de corps. Surely it was reasonable for\nCongress to conclude that the goal of preserving the in-\ntegrity of our country\u2019s top military honors is at least as\nworthy as that of protecting the prestige associated with\nfancy watches and designer handbags. Cf. San Francisco\nArts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483\nU. S. 522, 539\uf02d541 (1987) (rejecting First Amendment\nchallenge to law prohibiting certain unauthorized uses of\nthe word \u201cOlympic\u201d and recognizing that such uses harm\nthe U. S. Olympic Committee by \u201clessening the distinc-\ntiveness\u201d of the term).\n   Both the plurality and JUSTICE BREYER argue that\nCongress could have preserved the integrity of military\nhonors by means other than a criminal prohibition, but\nCongress had ample reason to believe that alternative\napproaches would not be adequate. The chief alternative\nthat is recommended is the compilation and release of a\ncomprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients.\nIf the public could readily access such a resource, it is\nargued, imposters would be quickly and easily exposed,\nand the proliferation of lies about military honors would\ncome to an end.\n   This remedy, unfortunately, will not work. The De-\npartment of Defense has explained that the most that it\ncan do is to create a database of recipients of certain top\nmilitary honors awarded since 2001. See Office of Under-\nsecretary of Defense, Report to the Senate and House\nArmed Services Committees on a Searchable Military\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   7\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nValor Decorations Database 4\uf02d5 (2009).13\n  Because a sufficiently comprehensive database is not\npracticable, lies about military awards cannot be remedied\nby what the plurality calls \u201ccounterspeech.\u201d Ante, at 15.\nWithout the requisite database, many efforts to refute\nfalse claims may be thwarted, and some legitimate award\nrecipients may be erroneously attacked. In addition, a\nsteady stream of stories in the media about the exposure\nof imposters would tend to increase skepticism among\nmembers of the public about the entire awards system.\nThis would only exacerbate the harm that the Stolen Valor\nAct is meant to prevent.\n  The plurality and the concurrence also suggest that\nCongress could protect the system of military honors by\nenacting a narrower statute. The plurality recommends a\nlaw that would apply only to lies that are intended to\n\u201csecure moneys or other valuable considerations.\u201d Ante, at\n11. In a similar vein, the concurrence comments that \u201ca\nmore finely tailored statute might . . . insist upon a show-\ning that the false statement caused specific harm.\u201d Ante,\nat 9 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But much damage is caused,\nboth to real award recipients and to the system of mili-\ntary honors, by false statements that are not linked to\nany financial or other tangible reward. Unless even a\nsmall financial loss\u2014say, a dollar given to a homeless man\nfalsely claiming to be a decorated veteran\u2014is more im-\nportant in the eyes of the First Amendment than the\ndamage caused to the very integrity of the military awards\nsystem, there is no basis for distinguishing between the\nStolen Valor Act and the alternative statutes that the\nplurality and concurrence appear willing to sustain.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Inaddition, since the Department may not disclose the Social Secu-\nrity numbers or birthdates of recipients, this database would be of\nlimited use in ascertaining the veracity of a claim involving a person\nwith a common name.

ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER also proposes narrowing the statute so\nthat it covers a shorter list of military awards, ante, at 9\n(opinion concurring in judgment), but he does not provide\na hint about where he thinks the line must be drawn.\nPerhaps he expects Congress to keep trying until it even-\ntually passes a law that draws the line in just the right\nplace.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Time and again, this Court has recognized that as a\ngeneral matter false factual statements possess no intrin-\nsic First Amendment value.

Laws prohibiting fraud, perjury, and defamation,\nfor example, were in existence when the First Amendment\nwas adopted, and their constitutionality is now beyond\nquestion. See, e.g., Donaldson v.

The right to freedom of\nspeech has been held to permit recovery for the intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress by means of a false state-\n10               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nment, see Falwell, supra, at 56, even though that tort did\nnot enter our law until the late 19th century, see W. Keeton,\nD. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton\non Law of Torts \u00a712, p. 60, and n. 47. (5th ed. 1984) (here-\ninafter Prosser and Keeton). And in Hill, supra, at 390,\nthe Court concluded that the free speech right allows\nrecovery for the even more modern tort of false-light inva-\nsion of privacy, see Prosser and Keeton \u00a7117, at 863.\n   In line with these holdings, it has long been assumed\nthat the First Amendment is not offended by prominent\ncriminal statutes with no close common-law analog. The\nmost well known of these is probably 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001,\nwhich makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d make\nany \u201cmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation\u201d in \u201cany matter within the jurisdiction of\nthe executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Gov-\nernment of the United States.\u201d Unlike perjury, \u00a71001\nis not limited to statements made under oath or before\nan official government tribunal. Nor does it require any\nshowing of \u201cpecuniary or property loss to the government.\u201d\nUnited States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S. 86, 93 (1941). In-\nstead, the statute is based on the need to protect \u201cagencies\nfrom the perversion which might result from the deceptive\npractices described.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Still other statutes make it a crime to falsely represent\nthat one is speaking on behalf of, or with the approval of,\nthe Federal Government. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a7912 (mak-\ning it a crime to falsely impersonate a federal officer); \u00a7709\n(making it a crime to knowingly use, without authoriza-\ntion, the names of enumerated federal agencies, such as\n\u201cFederal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d in a manner reasonably\ncalculated to convey the impression that a communication\nis approved or authorized by the agency). We have recog-\nnized that \u00a7912, like \u00a71001, does not require a showing of\npecuniary or property loss and that its purpose is to\n\u201c \u2018maintain the general good repute and dignity\u2019 \u201d of Gov-\n                      Cite as: 567 U.

All told, there are more than 100\nfederal criminal statutes that punish false statements\nmade in connection with areas of federal agency concern.\nSee United States v. Wells, 519 U.

Although we have made clear that\n\u201c[u]ntruthful speech . . . has never been protected for its own sake,\u201d\nVirginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,\n425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976), the most the plurality is willing to concede is\nthat \u201cthe falsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected,\u201d ante, at\n9. This represents a dramatic\u2014and entirely unjustified\u2014departure\nfrom the sound approach taken in past cases.\n   Respondent and his supporting amici attempt to limit this rule to\ncertain subsets of false statements, see, e.g., Brief for Respondent 53\n(asserting that, at most, only falsity that is proved to cause specific\nharm is stripped of its First Amendment protection), but the examples\ndescribed above belie that attempt. These examples show that the rule\nat least applies to (1) specific types of false statements that were\nneither illegal nor tortious in 1791 (the torts of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress and false-light invasion of privacy did not exist when\nthe First Amendment was adopted); (2) false speech that does not cause\npecuniary harm (the harm remedied by the torts of defamation, inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress, and false-light invasion of privacy\nis often nonpecuniary in nature, as is the harm inflicted by statements\nthat are illegal under \u00a7\u00a7912 and 1001); (3) false speech that does not\ncause detrimental reliance (neither perjury laws nor many of the\nfederal false statement statutes require that anyone actually rely on\nthe false statement); (4) particular false statements that are not shown\nin court to have caused specific harm (damages can be presumed in\ndefamation actions involving knowing or reckless falsehoods, and no\nshowing of specific harm is required in prosecutions under many of the\nfederal false statement statutes); and (5) false speech that does not\ncause harm to a specific individual (the purpose of many of the federal\n12                  UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat many in our society either approve or condone certain\ndiscrete categories of false statements, including false\nstatements made to prevent harm to innocent victims and\nso-called \u201cwhite lies.\u201d See ante, at 4. But respondent\u2019s\nfalse claim to have received the Medal of Honor did not\nfall into any of these categories. His lie did not \u201cprevent\nembarrassment, protect privacy, shield a person from\nprejudice, provide the sick with comfort, or preserve a\nchild\u2019s innocence.\u201d Ibid. Nor did his lie \u201cstop a panic or\notherwise preserve calm in the face of danger\u201d or further\nphilosophical or scientific debate. Ibid. Respondent\u2019s\nclaim, like all those covered by the Stolen Valor Act,\nserved no valid purpose.\n   Respondent and others who join him in attacking the\nStolen Valor Act take a different view. Respondent\u2019s brief\nfeatures a veritable paean to lying. According to respond-\nent, his lie about the Medal of Honor was nothing out of\nthe ordinary for 21st-century Americans. \u201cEveryone lies,\u201d\nhe says. Brief for Respondent 10. \u201cWe lie all the time.\u201d\nIbid. \u201c[H]uman beings are constantly forced to choose the\npersona we present to the world, and our choices nearly\nalways involve intentional omissions and misrepresenta-\ntions, if not outright deception.\u201d Id., at 39.

Varat as Amicus Curiae 5.\n   This radical interpretation of the First Amendment is\nnot supported by any precedent of this Court. The lies\ncovered by the Stolen Valor Act have no intrinsic value\nand thus merit no First Amendment protection unless\ntheir prohibition would chill other expression that falls\nwithin the Amendment\u2019s scope.

Gertz, 418\nU. S., at 342 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433\n(1963)). Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful\nspeech on matters of public concern, we have held that\nliability for the defamation of a public official or figure\nrequires proof that defamatory statements were made\nwith knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. See\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279\uf02d280\n(1964) (civil liability); Garrison, 379 U. S., at 74\uf02d75 (crim-\ninal liability). This same requirement applies when public\nofficials and figures seek to recover for the tort of inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress. See Falwell, 485\nU. S., at 55\uf02d56. And we have imposed \u201c[e]xacting proof\nrequirements\u201d in other contexts as well when necessary to\nensure that truthful speech is not chilled. Madigan, 538\nU. S., at 620 (complainant in a fraud action must show\nthat the defendant made a knowingly false statement of\nmaterial fact with the intent to mislead the listener and\nthat he succeeded in doing so); see also BE&K Constr., 536\nU. S., at 531 (regulation of baseless lawsuits limited to\nthose that are both \u201cobjectively baseless and subjectively\nmotivated by an unlawful purpose\u201d); Hartlage, 456 U. S.,\nat 61 (sustaining as-applied First Amendment challenge to\nlaw prohibiting certain \u201cfactual misstatements in the\ncourse of political debate\u201d where there had been no show-\ning that the disputed statement was made \u201cother than in\ngood faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or . . . with\nreckless disregard as to whether it was false or not\u201d). All\nof these proof requirements inevitably have the effect of\n14              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbringing some false factual statements within the protec-\ntion of the First Amendment, but this is justified in order\nto prevent the chilling of other, valuable speech.\n   These examples by no means exhaust the circumstances\nin which false factual statements enjoy a degree of in-\nstrumental constitutional protection. On the contrary,\nthere are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to\npenalize purportedly false speech would present a grave\nand unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.\nLaws restricting false statements about philosophy, reli-\ngion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and other mat-\nters of public concern would present such a threat. The\npoint is not that there is no such thing as truth or falsity\nin these areas or that the truth is always impossible to\nascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state\nto be the arbiter of truth.\n   Even where there is a wide scholarly consensus concern-\ning a particular matter, the truth is served by allowing\nthat consensus to be challenged without fear of reprisal.\nToday\u2019s accepted wisdom sometimes turns out to be mis-\ntaken. And in these contexts, \u201c[e]ven a false statement\nmay be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public\ndebate, since it brings about \u2018the clearer perception and\nlivelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with\nerror.\u2019 \u201d Sullivan, supra, at 279, n. 19 (quoting J. Mill, On\nLiberty 15 (R. McCallum ed. 1947)).\n   Allowing the state to proscribe false statements in these\nareas also opens the door for the state to use its power for\npolitical ends. Statements about history illustrate this\npoint. If some false statements about historical events\nmay be banned, how certain must it be that a statement is\nfalse before the ban may be upheld? And who should\nmake that calculation? While our cases prohibiting view-\npoint discrimination would fetter the state\u2019s power to some\ndegree, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 384\uf02d390\n(1992) (explaining that the First Amendment does not\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The speech punished by the\nAct is not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in\nintrinsic value, but it also fails to serve any instrumen-\ntal purpose that the First Amendment might protect. Tell-\ningly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech\nthe Stolen Valor Act might chill, even respondent\u2019s counsel\nconceded that the answer is none. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.\n                              C\n   Neither of the two opinions endorsed by Justices in the\nmajority claims that the false statements covered by the\nStolen Valor Act possess either intrinsic or instrumental\nvalue. Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the\ndistinct concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.\nSee ante, at 10 (plurality opinion) (the Act applies to \u201cper-\nsonal, whispered conversations within a home\u201d); ante, at 8\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (the Act \u201capplies in\nfamily, social, or other private contexts\u201d and in \u201cpolitical\ncontexts\u201d). But to strike down a statute on the basis that\nit is overbroad, it is necessary to show that the statute\u2019s\n\u201coverbreadth [is] substantial, not only in an absolute\nsense, but also relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d\nUnited States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 292 (2008); see\nalso ibid. (noting that this requirement has been \u201cvigor-\nously enforced\u201d). The plurality and the concurrence do not\neven attempt to make this showing.\n   The plurality additionally worries that a decision sus-\ntaining the Stolen Valor Act might prompt Congress and\nthe state legislatures to enact laws criminalizing lies\n16              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nabout \u201can endless list of subjects.\u201d Ante, at 11. The plu-\nrality apparently fears that we will see laws making it a\ncrime to lie about civilian awards such as college degrees\nor certificates of achievement in the arts and sports.\n  This concern is likely unfounded. With very good rea-\nson, military honors have traditionally been regarded as\nquite different from civilian awards. Nearly a century ago,\nCongress made it a crime to wear a military medal with-\nout authorization; we have no comparable tradition re-\ngarding such things as Super Bowl rings, Oscars, or Phi\nBeta Kappa keys.\n  In any event, if the plurality\u2019s concern is not entirely\nfanciful, it falls outside the purview of the First Amend-\nment. The problem that the plurality foresees\u2014that\nlegislative bodies will enact unnecessary and overly intru-\nsive criminal laws\u2014applies regardless of whether the laws\nin question involve speech or nonexpressive conduct. If\nthere is a problem with, let us say, a law making it a\ncriminal offense to falsely claim to have been a high school\nvaledictorian, the problem is not the suppression of speech\nbut the misuse of the criminal law, which should be re-\nserved for conduct that inflicts or threatens truly serious\nsocietal harm. The objection to this hypothetical law\nwould be the same as the objection to a law making it a\ncrime to eat potato chips during the graduation ceremony\nat which the high school valedictorian is recognized. The\nsafeguard against such laws is democracy, not the First\nAmendment. Not every foolish law is unconstitutional.\n  The Stolen Valor Act represents the judgment of the\npeople\u2019s elected representatives that false statements\nabout military awards are very different from false state-\nments about civilian awards. Certainly this is true with\nrespect to the high honor that respondent misappropri-\nated. Respondent claimed that he was awarded the Medal of\nHonor in 1987 for bravery during the Iran hostage crisis.\nThis singular award, however, is bestowed only on those\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

C. \u00a7\u00a7704 (b), (c).\n  Respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely claiming that he had\n  received the Medal of Honor, but reserved his right to appeal his\n  claim that the Act is unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit reversed,\n  finding the Act invalid under the First Amendment.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 3\u221218.\n617 F. 3d 1198, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\n  and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concluded that the Act infringes upon\n  speech protected by the First Amendment. Pp. 3\u201318.\n     (a) The Constitution \u201cdemands that content-based restrictions on\n  speech be presumed invalid . . . and that the Government bear the\n  burden of showing their constitutionality.\u201d Ashcroft v. American Civ-\n  il Liberties Union, 542 U. S. 656, 660.\n     Content-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for\n  a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity,\n  defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called \u201cfighting\n  words,\u201d child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting\n  some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to\n  prevent.\n     Absent from these few categories is any general exception for false\n  statements. The Government argues that cases such as Hustler\n  Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52, support its claim that\n  false statements have no value and hence no First Amendment pro-\n  tection. But all the Government\u2019s quotations derive from cases dis-\n2                     UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    cussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm as-\n    sociated with a false statement. In those decisions the falsity of the\n    speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Court\u2019s analysis, but neither\n    was it determinative. These prior decisions have not confronted a\n    measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing\n    more.\n       Even when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the\n    Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the\n    speech outside the First Amendment; the statement must be a know-\n    ing and reckless falsehood. See New York Times v. Sullivan, 376\n    U. S. 254, 280. Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that\n    limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits re-\n    covery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a dif-\n    ferent, far greater realm of discourse and expression.\n       The Government\u2019s three examples of false-speech regulation that\n    courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle\n    that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous\n    First Amendment scrutiny. The criminal prohibition of a false\n    statement made to Government officials in communications concern-\n    ing official matters, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001, does not lead to the broader\n    proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any\n    person, at any time, in any context. As for perjury statutes, perjured\n    statements lack First Amendment protection not simply because they\n    are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province\n    of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments. Finally, there\n    are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on\n    behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government\n    officer. These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or\n    speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n       While there may exist \u201csome categories of speech that have been\n    historically unprotected,\u201d but that the Court has not yet specifically\n    identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. ___, ___,\n    the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should\n    constitute a new category. Pp. 3\u221210.\n       (b) The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on\n    this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard\n    to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain. Per-\n    mitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense\n    would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects\n    about which false statements are punishable. That governmental\n    power has no clear limiting principle. Pp. 10\u221211.\n       (c) The Court applies the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny\u201d in assessing con-\n    tent-based restrictions on protected speech. Turner Broadcasting\n    System Inc. v.

While the Government\u2019s interest in protecting the integrity\nof the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the First Amendment re-\nquires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction im-\nposed and the injury to be prevented. Here, that link has not been\nshown. The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim\nthat the public\u2019s general perception of military awards is diluted by\nfalse claims such as those made by respondent. And it has not\nshown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule re-\nspondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to\nachieve its interest.\n   In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected\nspeech, the restriction must be the \u201cleast restrictive means among\navailable, effective alternatives.\u201d Ashcroft, 542 U. S., at 666. Here,\nthe Government could likely protect the integrity of the military\nawards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible\nand searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have al-\nready done. Pp. 12\u221218.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, joined by JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded that because\nthe Stolen Valor Act, as presently drafted, works disproportionate\nconstitutional harm, it fails intermediate scrutiny, and thus violates\nthe First Amendment. Pp. 1\u221210.\n   (a) In determining whether a statute violates the First Amend-\nment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit be-\ntween statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness\nof the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature\nand importance of the provision\u2019s countervailing objectives, the ex-\ntent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and\nwhether there are other, less restrictive alternatives. \u201cIntermediate\nscrutiny\u201d describes this approach. Since false factual statements are\nless likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribu-\ntion to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good\nreason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten\nspeech-related harm, such an approach is applied here. Pp. 1\u22123.\n   (b) The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual\nstatements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that\nthey be taken as true. Although the Court has frequently said or im-\nplied that false factual statements enjoy little First Amendment pro-\ntection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340, those\nstatements cannot be read to mean \u201cno protection at all.\u201d False fac-\ntual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.\nMoreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false\nstatement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements,\nthereby \u201cchilling\u201d a kind of speech that lies at the First Amendment\u2019s\nheart. See id., at 340\u2212341. And the pervasiveness of false factual\n4                     UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to\n    prosecute falsity without more. Those who are unpopular may fear\n    that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.\n       Although there are many statutes and common-law doctrines mak-\n    ing the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they\n    tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their\n    application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specif-\n    ic harm to identifiable victims. The Act lacks any such limiting fea-\n    tures. Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods\n    about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the\n    speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it\n    creates a significant risk of First Amendment harm. Pp. 3\u22128.\n       (c) The Act nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks to\n    protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life\n    for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country\u2019s recogni-\n    tion of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. P. 8.\n       (d) It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Gov-\n    ernment\u2019s objective in less burdensome ways. The First Amendment\n    risks flowing from the Act\u2019s breadth of coverage could be diminished\n    or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute\n    that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm\n    or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where\n    such lies are likely to cause harm.

Xavier Alvarez, the respondent\nhere, lied when he said that he played hockey for the\nDetroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from\nMexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Con-\ngressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new\nground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the\nStolen Valor Act of 2005. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704.\n   In 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as\na board member of the Three Valley Water District Board.\nThe board is a governmental entity with headquarters in\nClaremont, California. He introduced himself as follows:\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired marine of 25 years. I retired in the year 2001.\nBack in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of\nHonor. I got wounded many times by the same guy.\u201d 617\nF. 3d 1198, 1201\u20131202 (CA9 2010). None of this was true.\nFor all the record shows, respondent\u2019s statements were\nbut a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him.\nThe statements do not seem to have been made to secure\n2               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nemployment or financial benefits or admission to privileges\nreserved for those who had earned the Medal.\n  Respondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act\nfor lying about the Congressional Medal of Honor at the\nmeeting. The United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California rejected his claim that the statute is\ninvalid under the First Amendment. Respondent pleaded\nguilty to one count, reserving the right to appeal on his\nFirst Amendment claim. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by a divided\npanel, found the Act invalid under the First Amendment\nand reversed the conviction. Id., at 1218. With further\nopinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges,\nrehearing en banc was denied. 638 F. 3d 666 (2011). This\nCourt granted certiorari. 565 U. S. ___ (2011).\n  After certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case,\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\nalso in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act consti-\ntutional. United States v. Strandlof, 667 F. 3d 1146\n(2012). So there is now a conflict in the Courts of Appeals\non the question of the Act\u2019s validity.\n  This is the second case in two Terms requiring the Court\nto consider speech that can disparage, or attempt to steal,\nhonor that belongs to those who fought for this Nation in\nbattle. See Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. ___ (2011) (hateful\nprotests directed at the funeral of a serviceman who died\nin Iraq). Here the statement that the speaker held the\nMedal was an intended, undoubted lie.\n  It is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago,\nestablished an award so the Nation can hold in its high-\nest respect and esteem those who, in the course of carrying\nout the \u201csupreme and noble duty of contributing to the\ndefense of the rights and honor of the nation,\u201d Selective\nDraft Law Cases, 245 U.

Fundamental constitutional\nprinciples require that laws enacted to honor the brave\nmust be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution\nfor which they fought.\n   The Government contends the criminal prohibition is\na proper means to further its purpose in creating and\nawarding the Medal. When content-based speech regula-\ntion is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required.\nStatutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged\nby the sometimes inconvenient principles of the First\nAmendment. By this measure, the statutory provisions\nunder which respondent was convicted must be held inva-\nlid, and his conviction must be set aside.\n                            I\n  Respondent\u2019s claim to hold the Congressional Medal of\nHonor was false. There is no room to argue about in-\nterpretation or shades of meaning. On this premise, re-\nspondent violated \u00a7704(b); and, because the lie concerned\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, he was subject to an\nenhanced penalty under subsection (c).

The Government defends the\nstatute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose\nof the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are\ncompromised and frustrated by the false statements the\nstatute prohibits. It argues that false statements \u201chave\nno First Amendment value in themselves,\u201d and thus \u201care\nprotected only to the extent needed to avoid chilling fully\nprotected speech.\u201d Brief for United States 18, 20. Al-\nthough the statute covers respondent\u2019s speech, the Gov-\nernment argues that it leaves breathing room for pro-\ntected speech, for example speech which might criticize\nthe idea of the Medal or the importance of the military.\nThe Government\u2019s arguments cannot suffice to save the\nstatute.\n                             II\n  \u201c[A]s a general matter, the First Amendment means\nthat government has no power to restrict expression be-\ncause of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its\ncontent.\u201d Ashcroft v.

Instead, content-based restrictions on speech have\nbeen permitted, as a general matter, only when confined\nto the few \u201c \u2018historic and traditional categories [of expres-\nsion] long familiar to the bar,\u2019 \u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5)\n(quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State\nCrime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 127 (1991) (KENNEDY,\nJ., concurring in judgment)). Among these categories are\nadvocacy intended, and likely, to incite imminent lawless\naction, see Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969)\n(per curiam); obscenity, see, e.g., Miller v. California, 413\nU. S. 15 (1973); defamation, see, e.g., New York Times Co.\nv. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964) (providing substantial\nprotection for speech about public figures); Gertz v. Robert\nWelch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (imposing some limits on\nliability for defaming a private figure); speech integral to\ncriminal conduct, see, e.g., Giboney v. Empire Storage &\nIce Co., 336 U. S. 490 (1949); so-called \u201cfighting words,\u201d\nsee Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942);\nchild pornography, see New York v. Ferber, 458 U.

S.\n697, 716 (1931), although a restriction under the last\ncategory is most difficult to sustain, see New York Times\nCo. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (per curiam).\nThese categories have a historical foundation in the\nCourt\u2019s free speech tradition. The vast realm of free\nspeech and thought always protected in our tradition can\nstill thrive, and even be furthered, by adherence to those\ncategories and rules.\n   Absent from those few categories where the law allows\ncontent-based regulation of speech is any general excep-\ntion to the First Amendment for false statements. This\n6               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\ncomports with the common understanding that some false\nstatements are inevitable if there is to be an open and\nvigorous expression of views in public and private con-\nversation, expression the First Amendment seeks to guar-\nantee. See Sullivan, supra, at 271 (\u201cTh[e] erroneous\nstatement is inevitable in free debate\u201d).\n   The Government disagrees with this proposition. It\ncites language from some of this Court\u2019s precedents to\nsupport its contention that false statements have no value\nand hence no First Amendment protection. See also Brief\nfor Eugene Volokh et al. as Amici Curiae 2\u201311. These\nisolated statements in some earlier decisions do not sup-\nport the Government\u2019s submission that false statements,\nas a general rule, are beyond constitutional protection.\nThat conclusion would take the quoted language far from\nits proper context. For instance, the Court has stated\n\u201c[f]alse statements of fact are particularly valueless [be-\ncause] they interfere with the truth-seeking function of\nthe marketplace of ideas,\u201d Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Fal-\nwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52 (1988), and that false statements\n\u201care not protected by the First Amendment in the same\nmanner as truthful statements,\u201d Brown v. Hartlage, 456\nU. S. 45, 60\u201361 (1982). See also, e.g., Virginia Bd. of\nPharmacy, supra, at 771 (\u201cUntruthful speech, commercial\nor otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake\u201d);\nHerbert v. Lando, 441 U.

In those decisions the falsity of\nthe speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but\nneither was it determinative. The Court has never en-\ndorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that\nfalse statements receive no First Amendment protection.\nOur prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like\nthe Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing\nmore.\n  Even when considering some instances of defamation\nand fraud, moreover, the Court has been careful to in-\nstruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the\nspeech outside the First Amendment. The statement must\nbe a knowing or reckless falsehood. See Sullivan, supra,\nat 280 (prohibiting recovery of damages for a defamatory\nfalsehood made about a public official unless the state-\nment was made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with\nreckless disregard of whether it was false or not\u201d); see\nalso Garrison, supra, at 73 (\u201c[E]ven when the utterance is\nfalse, the great principles of the Constitution which secure\nfreedom of expression . . . preclude attaching adverse\nconsequences to any except the knowing or reckless false-\nhood\u201d); Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associ-\nates, Inc., 538 U. S. 600, 620 (2003) (\u201cFalse statement\nalone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud liability\u201d).\n  The Government thus seeks to use this principle for a\nnew purpose. It seeks to convert a rule that limits liability\neven in defamation cases where the law permits recovery\nfor tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a\ndifferent, far greater realm of discourse and expression.\nThat inverts the rationale for the exception. The require-\nments of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the\ntruth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation\ncases exists to allow more speech, not less. A rule de-\nsigned to tolerate certain speech ought not blossom to\nbecome a rationale for a rule restricting it.\n8                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   The Government then gives three examples of regula-\ntions on false speech that courts generally have found per-\nmissible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false state-\nment made to a Government official, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71001;\nsecond, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibi-\ntions on the false representation that one is speaking as a\nGovernment official or on behalf of the Government, see,\ne.g., \u00a7912; \u00a7709. These restrictions, however, do not estab-\nlish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements\nare exempt from exacting First Amendment scrutiny.\n   The federal statute prohibiting false statements to\nGovernment officials punishes \u201cwhoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or\njudicial branch of the Government . . . makes any mate-\nrially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or repre-\nsentation.\u201d \u00a71001. Section 1001\u2019s prohibition on false\nstatements made to Government officials, in communica-\ntions concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader\nproposition that false statements are unprotected when\nmade to any person, at any time, in any context.\n   The same point can be made about what the Court has\nconfirmed is the \u201cunquestioned constitutionality of perjury\nstatutes,\u201d both the federal statute, \u00a71623, and its state-law\nequivalents. United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 54\n(1978). See also Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., 366 U. S.\n36, 51, n. 10 (1961). It is not simply because perjured\nstatements are false that they lack First Amendment\nprotection. Perjured testimony \u201cis at war with justice\u201d\nbecause it can cause a court to render a \u201cjudgment not\nresting on truth.\u201d In re Michael, 326 U. S. 224, 227 (1945).\nPerjury undermines the function and province of the law\nand threatens the integrity of judgments that are the\nbasis of the legal system. See United States v. Dunnigan,\n507 U. S. 87, 97 (1993) (\u201cTo uphold the integrity of our\ntrial system . . . the constitutionality of perjury statutes is\nunquestioned\u201d). Unlike speech in other contexts, testi-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nmony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to\nremind the witness that his or her statements will be the\nbasis for official governmental action, action that often\naffects the rights and liberties of others. Sworn testimony\nis quite distinct from lies not spoken under oath and sim-\nply intended to puff up oneself.\n   Statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is\nspeaking on behalf of the Government, or that prohibit im-\npersonating a Government officer, also protect the in-\ntegrity of Government processes, quite apart from merely\nrestricting false speech. Title 18 U. S. C. \u00a7912, for ex-\nample, prohibits impersonating an officer or employee of\nthe United States. Even if that statute may not require\nproving an \u201cactual financial or property loss\u201d resulting\nfrom the deception, the statute is itself confined to \u201cmain-\ntain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of . . . gov-\nernment . . . service itself.\u201d United States v. Lepowitch,\n318 U. S. 702, 704 (1943) (internal quotation marks omit-\nted). The same can be said for prohibitions on the unau-\nthorized use of the names of federal agencies such as the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation in a manner calculated to\nconvey that the communication is approved, see \u00a7709, or\nusing words such as \u201cFederal\u201d or \u201cUnited States\u201d in the\ncollection of private debts in order to convey that the\ncommunication has official authorization, see \u00a7712. These\nexamples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or\nspeech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n   As our law and tradition show, then, there are instances\nin which the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is\nprotected. Some false speech may be prohibited even if\nanalogous true speech could not be. This opinion does not\nimply that any of these targeted prohibitions are somehow\nvulnerable. But it also rejects the notion that false speech\nshould be in a general category that is presumptively\nunprotected.\n   Although the First Amendment stands against any\n10               UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n\u201cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of\nspeech outside the scope of the First Amendment,\u201d Ste-\nvens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), the Court has\nacknowledged that perhaps there exist \u201csome categories of\nspeech that have been historically unprotected . . . but\nhave not yet been specifically identified or discussed . . . in\nour case law.\u201d Ibid. Before exempting a category of\nspeech from the normal prohibition on content-based re-\nstrictions, however, the Court must be presented with \u201cper-\nsuasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is\npart of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of\nproscription,\u201d Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4). The Government\nhas not demonstrated that false statements generally\nshould constitute a new category of unprotected speech on\nthis basis.\n                               III\n  The probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on free-\ndom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the\nreasons for the Law\u2019s distrust of content-based speech\nprohibitions.\n  The Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement\nmade at any time, in any place, to any person. It can be\nassumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical per-\nformance. See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U. S.\n1, 20 (1990) (recognizing that some statements nominally\npurporting to contain false facts in reality \u201ccannot reason-\nably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an indi-\nvidual\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\nStill, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the\nstatute puts it in conflict with the First Amendment. Here\nthe lie was made in a public meeting, but the statute\nwould apply with equal force to personal, whispered con-\nversations within a home. The statute seeks to control\nand suppress all false statements on this one subject in\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

And it does so en-\ntirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the\npurpose of material gain. See San Francisco Arts & Ath-\nletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S. 522,\n539\u2013540 (1987) (prohibiting a nonprofit corporation from\nexploiting the \u201ccommercial magnetism\u201d of the word \u201cOlym-\npic\u201d when organizing an athletic competition (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   Permitting the government to decree this speech to be\na criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or\nmade in a barely audible whisper, would endorse govern-\nment authority to compile a list of subjects about which\nfalse statements are punishable. That governmental\npower has no clear limiting principle. Our constitutional\ntradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania\u2019s\nMinistry of Truth. See G. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four\n(1949) (Centennial ed. 2003). Were this law to be sus-\ntained, there could be an endless list of subjects the Na-\ntional Government or the States could single out. Where\nfalse claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys\nor other valuable considerations, say offers of employment,\nit is well established that the Government may restrict\nspeech without affronting the First Amendment. See, e.g.,\nVirginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771 (noting that\nfraudulent speech generally falls outside the protections of\nthe First Amendment). But the Stolen Valor Act is not so\nlimited in its reach. Were the Court to hold that the in-\nterest in truthful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a\nban on speech, absent any evidence that the speech was\nused to gain a material advantage, it would give govern-\nment a broad censorial power unprecedented in this\nCourt\u2019s cases or in our constitutional tradition. The mere\npotential for the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill\nthe First Amendment cannot permit if free speech,\nthought, and discourse are to remain a foundation of our\nfreedom.\n12              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n                            IV\n  The previous discussion suffices to show that the Act\nconflicts with free speech principles. But even when ex-\namined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act\ncannot survive. In assessing content-based restrictions\non protected speech, the Court has not adopted a free-\nwheeling approach, see Stevens, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7) (\u201cThe First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech\ndoes not extend only to categories of speech that survive\nan ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits\u201d),\nbut rather has applied the \u201cmost exacting scrutiny.\u201d\nTurner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,\n642 (1994). Although the objectives the Government seeks\nto further by the statute are not without significance, the\nCourt must, and now does, find the Act does not satisfy\nexacting scrutiny.\n  The Government is correct when it states military med-\nals \u201cserve the important public function of recognizing and\nexpressing gratitude for acts of heroism and sacrifice in\nmilitary service,\u201d and also \u201c \u2018foste[r] morale, mission ac-\ncomplishment and esprit de corps\u2019 among service mem-\nbers.\u201d Brief for United States 37, 38.

Boynton ed.\n1883). Time has not diminished this idea. In periods of\nwar and peace alike public recognition of valor and noble\nsacrifice by men and women in uniform reinforces the\npride and national resolve that the military relies upon to\nfulfill its mission.\n  These interests are related to the integrity of the mili-\ntary honors system in general, and the Congressional\nMedal of Honor in particular. Although millions have\nserved with brave resolve, the Medal, which is the highest\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The Government\u2019s interest in\nprotecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond\nquestion.\n   But to recite the Government\u2019s compelling interests is\nnot to end the matter.

Although appearing to concede that \u201can\nisolated misrepresentation by itself would not tarnish the\nmeaning of military honors,\u201d the Government asserts it is\n\u201ccommon sense that false representations have the ten-\ndency to dilute the value and meaning of military awards,\u201d\nBrief for United States 49, 54. It must be acknowledged\nthat when a pretender claims the Medal to be his own, the\nlie might harm the Government by demeaning the high\npurpose of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms,\nand creating the appearance that the Medal is awarded\nmore often than is true. Furthermore, the lie may offend\nthe true holders of the Medal. From one perspective it in-\nsults their bravery and high principles when falsehood\nputs them in the unworthy company of a pretender.\n   Yet these interests do not satisfy the Government\u2019s\nheavy burden when it seeks to regulate protected speech.\nSee United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,\n529 U. S. 803, 818 (2000). The Government points to no\nevidence to support its claim that the public\u2019s general\nperception of military awards is diluted by false claims\nsuch as those made by Alvarez. Cf.

The Government has not shown,\nand cannot show, why counterspeech would not suffice to\nachieve its interest. The facts of this case indicate that\nthe dynamics of free speech, of counterspeech, of refuta-\ntion, can overcome the lie. Respondent lied at a public\nmeeting. Even before the FBI began investigating him for\nhis false statements \u201cAlvarez was perceived as a phony,\u201d\n617 F. 3d, at 1211.

There\nis good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall\nother false claimants. See Brief for Reporters Committee\nfor Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 30\u201333\n(listing numerous examples of public exposure of false\nclaimants). Indeed, the outrage and contempt expressed\nfor respondent\u2019s lies can serve to reawaken and reinforce\nthe public\u2019s respect for the Medal, its recipients, and its\nhigh purpose. The acclaim that recipients of the Congres-\nsional Medal of Honor receive also casts doubt on the\nproposition that the public will be misled by the claims of\ncharlatans or become cynical of those whose heroic deeds\nearned them the Medal by right. See, e.g., Well Done,\nWashington Post, Feb. 5, 1943, p. 8 (reporting on Pres-\nident Roosevelt\u2019s awarding the Congressional Medal of\nHonor to Maj. Gen. Alexander Vandegrift); Devroy, Medal\nof Honor Given to 2 Killed in Somalia, Washington Post,\nMay 24, 1994, p. A6 (reporting on President Clinton\u2019s\nawarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to two special\nforces soldiers killed during operations in Somalia).\n   The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is\ntrue. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The\n16              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nresponse to the unreasoned is the rational; to the unin-\nformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple\ntruth. See Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927)\n(Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201cIf there be time to expose\nthrough discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert\nthe evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be ap-\nplied is more speech, not enforced silence\u201d). The theory of\nour Constitution is \u201cthat the best test of truth is the power\nof the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of\nthe market,\u201d Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630\n(1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The First Amendment\nitself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like,\nand for good reason. Freedom of speech and thought flows\nnot from the beneficence of the state but from the inalien-\nable rights of the person. And suppression of speech by\nthe government can make exposure of falsity more diffi-\ncult, not less so. Society has the right and civic duty to\nengage in open, dynamic, rational discourse. These ends\nare not well served when the government seeks to orches-\ntrate public discussion through content-based mandates.\n   Expressing its concern that counterspeech is insuf-\nficient, the Government responds that because \u201csome\nmilitary records have been lost . . . some claims [are] un-\nverifiable,\u201d Brief for United States 50. This proves little,\nhowever; for without verifiable records, successful crimi-\nnal prosecution under the Act would be more difficult in\nany event. So, in cases where public refutation will not\nserve the Government\u2019s interest, the Act will not either.\nIn addition, the Government claims that \u201cmany [false\nclaims] will remain unchallenged.\u201d Id., at 55. The Gov-\nernment provides no support for the contention. And in\nany event, in order to show that public refutation is not an\nadequate alternative, the Government must demonstrate\nthat unchallenged claims undermine the public\u2019s percep-\ntion of the military and the integrity of its awards system.\nThis showing has not been made.\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   It is a fair assumption that any true holders of the\nMedal who had heard of Alvarez\u2019s false claims would have\nbeen fully vindicated by the community\u2019s expression of\noutrage, showing as it did the Nation\u2019s high regard for the\nMedal. The same can be said for the Government\u2019s inter-\nest. The American people do not need the assistance of a\ngovernment prosecution to express their high regard for\nthe special place that military heroes hold in our tradi-\ntion. Only a weak society needs government protection or\nintervention before it pursues its resolve to preserve the\ntruth. Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its\nvindication.\n   In addition, when the Government seeks to regulate\nprotected speech, the restriction must be the \u201cleast restric-\ntive means among available, effective alternatives.\u201d Ash-\ncroft, 542 U. S., at 666. There is, however, at least one\nless speech-restrictive means by which the Government\ncould likely protect the integrity of the military awards\nsystem. A Government-created database could list Con-\ngressional Medal of Honor winners. Were a database\naccessible through the Internet, it would be easy to verify\nand expose false claims. It appears some private individ-\nuals have already created databases similar to this,\nsee Brief for Respondent 25, and at least one data-\nbase of past winners is online and fully searchable, see\nCongressional Medal of Honor Society, Full Archive,\nhttp://www.cmohs.org/recipient-archive.php. The Solicitor\nGeneral responds that although Congress and the De-\npartment of Defense investigated the feasibility of estab-\nlishing a database in 2008, the Government \u201cconcluded\nthat such a database would be impracticable and insuf-\nficiently comprehensive.\u201d Brief for United States 55.\nWithout more explanation, it is difficult to assess the Gov-\nernment\u2019s claim, especially when at least one database of\nCongressional Medal of Honor winners already exists.\n   The Government may have responses to some of these\ncriticisms, but there has been no clear showing of the\n18              UNITED STATES v.

But I do not rest my\nconclusion upon a strict categorical analysis. Ante, at 4\u2013\n10. Rather, I base that conclusion upon the fact that the\nstatute works First Amendment harm, while the Govern-\nment can achieve its legitimate objectives in less restric-\ntive ways.\n                                I\n   In determining whether a statute violates the First\nAmendment, this Court has often found it appropriate to\nexamine the fit between statutory ends and means. In\ndoing so, it has examined speech-related harms, justifica-\ntions, and potential alternatives. In particular, it has\ntaken account of the seriousness of the speech-related\nharm the provision will likely cause, the nature and im-\nportance of the provision\u2019s countervailing objectives, the\nextent to which the provision will tend to achieve those\nobjectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive\nways of doing so. Ultimately the Court has had to deter-\nmine whether the statute works speech-related harm that\nis out of proportion to its justifications.\n   Sometimes the Court has referred to this approach as\n\u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d sometimes as \u201cproportionality\u201d\n2               UNITED STATES v.

Laws\nrestricting false statements about philosophy, religion,\nhistory, the social sciences, the arts, and the like raise\nsuch concerns, and in many contexts have called for strict\nscrutiny. But this case does not involve such a law. The\ndangers of suppressing valuable ideas are lower where, as\nhere, the regulations concern false statements about easily\nverifiable facts that do not concern such subject matter.\nSuch false factual statements are less likely than are true\nfactual statements to make a valuable contribution to the\nmarketplace of ideas. And the government often has\ngood reasons to prohibit such false speech. See infra, at\n5\u20137 (listing examples of statutes and doctrines regulating\nfalse factual speech). But its regulation can nonetheless\nthreaten speech-related harms. Those circumstances lead\nme to apply what the Court has termed \u201cintermediate\nscrutiny\u201d here.\n                             II\n\n                             A\n\n   The Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime \u201cfalsely\u201d to \u201crep-\nresen[t]\u201d oneself \u201cto have been awarded any decoration or\nmedal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of\nthe United States.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704(b). I would read the\nstatute favorably to the Government as criminalizing only\nfalse factual statements made with knowledge of their fal-\nsity and with the intent that they be taken as true. See\nStaples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994) (courts\nconstrue statutes \u201cin light of the background rules of the\ncommon law, . . . in which the requirement of some mens\nrea for a crime is firmly embedded\u201d); cf. New York Times\nCo. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279\u2013280 (1964) (First\nAmendment allows a public official to recover for defama-\n4               UNITED STATES v.

But although this\ninterpretation diminishes the extent to which the statute\nendangers First Amendment values, it does not eliminate\nthe threat.\n   I must concede, as the Government points out, that this\nCourt has frequently said or implied that false factual\nstatements enjoy little First Amendment protection. See,\ne.g., BE&K Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 536 U. S. 516, 531 (2002)\n(\u201c[F]alse statements may be unprotected for their own\nsake\u201d); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 52\n(1988) (\u201cFalse statements of fact are particularly value-\nless\u201d); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340\n(1974) (\u201c[T]he erroneous statement of fact is not worthy of\nconstitutional protection\u201d).\n   But these judicial statements cannot be read to mean\n\u201cno protection at all.\u201d False factual statements can serve\nuseful human objectives, for example: in social contexts,\nwhere they may prevent embarrassment, protect privacy,\nshield a person from prejudice, provide the sick with com-\nfort, or preserve a child\u2019s innocence; in public contexts,\nwhere they may stop a panic or otherwise preserve calm in\nthe face of danger; and even in technical, philosophical,\nand scientific contexts, where (as Socrates\u2019 methods sug-\ngest) examination of a false statement (even if made delib-\nerately to mislead) can promote a form of thought that\nultimately helps realize the truth. See, e.g., 638 F. 3d\n666, 673\u2013675 (CA9 2011) (Kozinski, J., concurring in denial\nof rehearing en banc) (providing numerous examples); S.\nBok, Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life (1999)\n(same); New York Times Co., supra, at 279, n. 19 (\u201cEven a\nfalse statement may be deemed to make a valuable contri-\nbution to public debate, since it brings about \u2018the clearer\nperception and livelier impression of truth, produced by\nits collision with error\u2019 \u201d (quoting J.

S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Moreover, as the Court has often said, the threat of\ncriminal prosecution for making a false statement can\ninhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby\n\u201cchilling\u201d a kind of speech that lies at the First Amend-\nment\u2019s heart. See, e.g., Gertz, supra, at 340\u2013341. Hence,\nthe Court emphasizes mens rea requirements that provide\n\u201cbreathing room\u201d for more valuable speech by reducing an\nhonest speaker\u2019s fear that he may accidentally incur liabil-\nity for speaking.\n   Further, the pervasiveness of false statements, made\nfor better or for worse motives, made thoughtlessly or de-\nliberately, made with or without accompanying harm,\nprovides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to\nprosecute falsity without more. And those who are un-\npopular may fear that the government will use that\nweapon selectively, say by prosecuting a pacifist who sup-\nports his cause by (falsely) claiming to have been a war\nhero, while ignoring members of other political groups who\nmight make similar false claims.\n   I also must concede that many statutes and common-\nlaw doctrines make the utterance of certain kinds of false\nstatements unlawful. Those prohibitions, however, tend to\nbe narrower than the statute before us, in that they limit\nthe scope of their application, sometimes by requiring\nproof of specific harm to identifiable victims; sometimes by\nspecifying that the lies be made in contexts in which a\ntangible harm to others is especially likely to occur; and\nsometimes by limiting the prohibited lies to those that are\nparticularly likely to produce harm.\n   Fraud statutes, for example, typically require proof of a\nmisrepresentation that is material, upon which the victim\nrelied, and which caused actual injury. See Restatement\n(Second) of Torts \u00a7525 (1976). Defamation statutes focus\nupon statements of a kind that harm the reputation of\nanother or deter third parties from association or dealing\nwith the victim. See id., \u00a7\u00a7558, 559.

ALVAREZ\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress (like torts in-\nvolving placing a victim in a false light) concern falsehoods\nthat tend to cause harm to a specific victim of an emotional-,\ndignitary-, or privacy-related kind. See id., \u00a7652E.\n  Perjury statutes prohibit a particular set of false state-\nments\u2014those made under oath\u2014while requiring a show-\ning of materiality. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71621. Statutes\nforbidding lying to a government official (not under oath)\nare typically limited to circumstances where a lie is likely\nto work particular and specific harm by interfering with\nthe functioning of a government department, and those\nstatutes also require a showing of materiality. See, e.g.,\n\u00a71001.\n  Statutes prohibiting false claims of terrorist attacks, or\nother lies about the commission of crimes or catastrophes,\nrequire proof that substantial public harm be directly\nforeseeable, or, if not, involve false statements that are\nvery likely to bring about that harm. See, e.g., 47 CFR\n\u00a773.1217 (2011) (requiring showing of foreseeability and\nactual substantial harm); 18 U. S. C. \u00a71038(a)(1) (prohibit-\ning knowing false statements claiming that terrorist at-\ntacks have taken, are taking, or will take, place).\n  Statutes forbidding impersonation of a public official\ntypically focus on acts of impersonation, not mere speech,\nand may require a showing that, for example, someone\nwas deceived into following a \u201ccourse [of action] he would\nnot have pursued but for the deceitful conduct.\u201d United\nStates v.

Similarly, a false claim of possession of a medal\nor other honor creates confusion about who is entitled to\nwear it, thus diluting its value to those who have earned\nit, to their families, and to their country. But trademark\nstatutes are focused upon commercial and promotional\nactivities that are likely to dilute the value of a mark.\nIndeed, they typically require a showing of likely confu-\nsion, a showing that tends to assure that the feared harm\nwill in fact take place. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a71114(1)(a); KP\nPermanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.,\n543 U. S. 111, 117 (2004); see also San Francisco Arts &\nAthletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U. S.\n522, 539\u2013540, 548 (1987) (upholding statute giving the\nUnited States Olympic Committee the right to prohibit\ncertain commercial and promotional uses of the word\n\u201cOlympic\u201d).\n   While this list is not exhaustive, it is sufficient to show\nthat few statutes, if any, simply prohibit without limita-\ntion the telling of a lie, even a lie about one particular\nmatter. Instead, in virtually all these instances limita-\ntions of context, requirements of proof of injury, and the\nlike, narrow the statute to a subset of lies where specific\nharm is more likely to occur. The limitations help to make\ncertain that the statute does not allow its threat of liabil-\nity or criminal punishment to roam at large, discouraging\nor forbidding the telling of the lie in contexts where harm\nis unlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.\n   The statute before us lacks any such limiting features.\nIt may be construed to prohibit only knowing and inten-\ntional acts of deception about readily verifiable facts with-\nin the personal knowledge of the speaker, thus reducing\nthe risk that valuable speech is chilled. Supra, at 3\u20134.\nBut it still ranges very broadly. And that breadth means\nthat it creates a significant risk of First Amendment\n8                UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nharm. As written, it applies in family, social, or other\nprivate contexts, where lies will often cause little harm. It\nalso applies in political contexts, where although such lies\nare more likely to cause harm, the risk of censorious se-\nlectivity by prosecutors is also high. Further, given the\npotential haziness of individual memory along with the\nlarge number of military awards covered (ranging from\nmedals for rifle marksmanship to the Congressional Medal\nof Honor), there remains a risk of chilling that is not com-\npletely eliminated by mens rea requirements; a speaker\nmight still be worried about being prosecuted for a careless\nfalse statement, even if he does not have the intent re-\nquired to render him liable. And so the prohibition may be\napplied where it should not be applied, for example, to bar\nstool braggadocio or, in the political arena, subtly but\nselectively to speakers that the Government does not like.\nThese considerations lead me to believe that the statute as\nwritten risks significant First Amendment harm.\n                              B\n  Like both the plurality and the dissent, I believe the\nstatute nonetheless has substantial justification. It seeks\nto protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their\nhealth and life for their country. The statute serves this\ninterest by seeking to preserve intact the country\u2019s recog-\nnition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors. To\npermit those who have not earned those honors to claim\notherwise dilutes the value of the awards. Indeed, the\nNation cannot fully honor those who have sacrificed so\nmuch for their country\u2019s honor unless those who claim to\nhave received its military awards tell the truth. Thus, the\nstatute risks harming protected interests but only in order\nto achieve a substantial countervailing objective.\n                           C\n    We must therefore ask whether it is possible substan-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntially to achieve the Government\u2019s objective in less bur-\ndensome ways. In my view, the answer to this question is\n\u201cyes.\u201d Some potential First Amendment threats can be\nalleviated by interpreting the statute to require knowledge\nof falsity, etc. Supra, at 3\u20134. But other First Amendment\nrisks, primarily risks flowing from breadth of coverage,\nremain. Supra, at 4\u20135, 7\u20138. As is indicated by the limita-\ntions on the scope of the many other kinds of statutes\nregulating false factual speech, supra, at 5\u20137, it should\nbe possible significantly to diminish or eliminate these re-\nmaining risks by enacting a similar but more finely tai-\nlored statute. For example, not all military awards are\nalike. Congress might determine that some warrant\ngreater protection than others. And a more finely tailored\nstatute might, as other kinds of statutes prohibiting false\nfactual statements have done, insist upon a showing that\nthe false statement caused specific harm or at least was\nmaterial, or focus its coverage on lies most likely to be\nharmful or on contexts where such lies are most likely to\ncause harm.\n   I recognize that in some contexts, particularly political\ncontexts, such a narrowing will not always be easy to\nachieve. In the political arena a false statement is more\nlikely to make a behavioral difference (say, by leading the\nlisteners to vote for the speaker) but at the same time\ncriminal prosecution is particularly dangerous (say, by\nradically changing a potential election result) and conse-\nquently can more easily result in censorship of speakers\nand their ideas. Thus, the statute may have to be signifi-\ncantly narrowed in its applications. Some lower courts\nhave upheld the constitutionality of roughly comparable\nbut narrowly tailored statutes in political contexts. See,\ne.g., United We Stand America, Inc. v.

Without ex-\npressing any view on the validity of those cases, I would\nalso note, like the plurality, that in this area more accu-\nrate information will normally counteract the lie. And an\naccurate, publicly available register of military awards,\neasily obtainable by political opponents, may well ade-\nquately protect the integrity of an award against those\nwho would falsely claim to have earned it. See ante, at\n17\u201318. And so it is likely that a more narrowly tailored\nstatute combined with such information-disseminating\ndevices will effectively serve Congress\u2019 end.\n   The Government has provided no convincing explana-\ntion as to why a more finely tailored statute would not\nwork. In my own view, such a statute could significantly\nreduce the threat of First Amendment harm while permit-\nting the statute to achieve its important protective objec-\ntive. That being so, I find the statute as presently drafted\nworks disproportionate constitutional harm. It conse-\nquently fails intermediate scrutiny, and so violates the\nFirst Amendment.\n   For these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The Court strikes down the\nStolen Valor Act of 2005, which was enacted to stem an\nepidemic of false claims about military decorations. These\nlies, Congress reasonably concluded, were undermining\nour country\u2019s system of military honors and inflicting real\nharm on actual medal recipients and their families.\n   Building on earlier efforts to protect the military awards\nsystem, Congress responded to this problem by crafting a\nnarrow statute that presents no threat to the freedom of\nspeech. The statute reaches only knowingly false state-\nments about hard facts directly within a speaker\u2019s per-\nsonal knowledge. These lies have no value in and of\nthemselves, and proscribing them does not chill any\nvaluable speech.\n   By holding that the First Amendment nevertheless\nshields these lies, the Court breaks sharply from a long\nline of cases recognizing that the right to free speech does\nnot protect false factual statements that inflict real harm\nand serve no legitimate interest. I would adhere to that\nprinciple and would thus uphold the constitutionality of\nthis valuable law.\n2                    UNITED STATES v.

S. C. \u00a7704(b). Properly construed,\nthis statute is limited in five significant respects. First,\nthe Act applies to only a narrow category of false represen-\ntations about objective facts that can almost always be\nproved or disproved with near certainty. Second, the Act\nconcerns facts that are squarely within the speaker\u2019s\npersonal knowledge. Third, as the Government main-\ntains, see Brief for United States 15\uf02d17, and both the\nplurality, see ante, at 7, and the concurrence, see ante, at 3\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment), seemingly accept, a\nconviction under the Act requires proof beyond a reasona-\nble doubt that the speaker actually knew that the repre-\nsentation was false.1 Fourth, the Act applies only to\nstatements that could reasonably be interpreted as com-\nmunicating actual facts; it does not reach dramatic per-\nformances, satire, parody, hyperbole, or the like.2 Finally,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Although the Act does not use the term \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201cknowingly,\u201d\nwe have explained that criminal statutes must be construed \u201cin light of\nthe background rules of the common law . . . in which the requirement\nof some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded.\u201d Staples v. United\nStates, 511 U. S. 600, 605 (1994). The Act\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cfalsely\nrepresents,\u201d moreover, connotes a knowledge requirement. See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 1022 (8th ed. 2004) (defining a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d or\n\u201cfalse representation\u201d to mean \u201c[t]he act of making a false or misleading\nassertion about something, usu. with the intent to deceive\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   2 See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, at 1327 (defining \u201crepresentation\u201d\n\nto mean a \u201cpresentation of fact\u201d); see also Milkovich v.

The false statements\nproscribed by the Act are highly unlikely to be tied to\nany particular political or ideological message. In the rare\ncases where that is not so, the Act applies equally to all\nfalse statements, whether they tend to disparage or com-\nmend the Government, the military, or the system of mil-\nitary honors.\n   The Stolen Valor Act follows a long tradition of efforts to\nprotect our country\u2019s system of military honors. When\nGeorge Washington, as the commander of the Continental\nArmy, created the very first \u201chonorary badges of distinc-\ntion\u201d for service in our country\u2019s military, he established\na rigorous system to ensure that these awards would be\nreceived and worn by only the truly deserving. See Gen-\neral Orders of George Washington Issued at Newburgh\non the Hudson, 1782\u20131783, p. 35 (E. Boynton ed. 1883)\n(reprint 1973) (requiring the submission of \u201cincontest-\nible proof \u201d of \u201csingularly meritorious action\u201d to the Com-\nmander in Chief). Washington warned that anyone with the\n\u201cinsolence to assume\u201d a badge that had not actually been\nearned would be \u201cseverely punished.\u201d Id., at 34.\n   Building on this tradition, Congress long ago made it a\nfederal offense for anyone to wear, manufacture, or sell\ncertain military decorations without authorization. See\nAct of Feb. 24, 1923, ch. 110, 42 Stat. 1286 (codified as\namended at 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704(a)). Although this Court has\nnever opined on the constitutionality of that particular\nprovision, we have said that \u00a7702, which makes it a crime\nto wear a United States military uniform without authori-\nzation, is \u201ca valid statute on its face.\u201d Schacht v. United\nStates, 398 U. S. 58, 61 (1970).\n   Congress passed the Stolen Valor Act in response to a\nproliferation of false claims concerning the receipt of\nmilitary awards.

In many instances,\nthe harm is tangible in nature: Individuals often falsely\nrepresent themselves as award recipients in order to\nobtain financial or other material rewards, such as lucra-\ntive contracts and government benefits.10 An investigation\nof false claims in a single region of the United States, for\nexample, revealed that 12 men had defrauded the De-\npartment of Veterans Affairs out of more than $1.4 million\nin veteran\u2019s benefits.11 In other cases, the harm is less\ntangible, but nonetheless significant. The lies proscribed\nby the Stolen Valor Act tend to debase the distinctive\nhonor of military awards. See Stolen Valor Act of 2005,\n\u00a72, 120 Stat. 3266, note following 18 U. S. C. \u00a7704 (finding\nthat \u201c[f]raudulent claims surrounding the receipt of [mili-\ntary decorations and medals] damage the reputation and\nmeaning of such decorations and medals\u201d). And legitimate\naward recipients and their families have expressed the\nharm they endure when an imposter takes credit for he-\nroic actions that he never performed. One Medal of Honor\nrecipient described the feeling as a \u201c \u2018slap in the face\nof veterans who have paid the price and earned their\nmedals.\u2019 \u201d12\n   It is well recognized in trademark law that the prolifera-\ntion of cheap imitations of luxury goods blurs the \u201c \u2018signal\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 Indeed, the first person to be prosecuted under the Stolen Valor\n\nAct apparently \u201cparlayed his medals into lucrative security consulting\ncontracts.\u201d Zambito, War Crime: FBI Targets Fake Heroes, New York\nDaily News, May 6, 2007, http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/\nwar-crime-fbi-targets-fake-heroes-article-1.249168.\n  11 Dept. of Justice, Northwest Crackdown on Fake Veterans in \u201cOper-\n\nation Stolen Valor,\u201d Sept. 21, 2007, http://www.justice.gov/usao/waw/\npress/2007/sep/operationstolenvalor.html.\n  12 Cato, High Court Tussles With False Heroics: Free Speech or Fel-\n\nony?

In much the same way, the\nproliferation of false claims about military awards blurs\nthe signal given out by the actual awards by making them\nseem more common than they really are, and this diluting\neffect harms the military by hampering its efforts to foster\nmorale and esprit de corps. Surely it was reasonable for\nCongress to conclude that the goal of preserving the in-\ntegrity of our country\u2019s top military honors is at least as\nworthy as that of protecting the prestige associated with\nfancy watches and designer handbags. Cf. San Francisco\nArts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483\nU. S. 522, 539\uf02d541 (1987) (rejecting First Amendment\nchallenge to law prohibiting certain unauthorized uses of\nthe word \u201cOlympic\u201d and recognizing that such uses harm\nthe U. S. Olympic Committee by \u201clessening the distinc-\ntiveness\u201d of the term).\n   Both the plurality and JUSTICE BREYER argue that\nCongress could have preserved the integrity of military\nhonors by means other than a criminal prohibition, but\nCongress had ample reason to believe that alternative\napproaches would not be adequate. The chief alternative\nthat is recommended is the compilation and release of a\ncomprehensive list or database of actual medal recipients.\nIf the public could readily access such a resource, it is\nargued, imposters would be quickly and easily exposed,\nand the proliferation of lies about military honors would\ncome to an end.\n   This remedy, unfortunately, will not work. The De-\npartment of Defense has explained that the most that it\ncan do is to create a database of recipients of certain top\nmilitary honors awarded since 2001. See Office of Under-\nsecretary of Defense, Report to the Senate and House\nArmed Services Committees on a Searchable Military\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

In addition, a\nsteady stream of stories in the media about the exposure\nof imposters would tend to increase skepticism among\nmembers of the public about the entire awards system.\nThis would only exacerbate the harm that the Stolen Valor\nAct is meant to prevent.\n  The plurality and the concurrence also suggest that\nCongress could protect the system of military honors by\nenacting a narrower statute. The plurality recommends a\nlaw that would apply only to lies that are intended to\n\u201csecure moneys or other valuable considerations.\u201d Ante, at\n11. In a similar vein, the concurrence comments that \u201ca\nmore finely tailored statute might . . . insist upon a show-\ning that the false statement caused specific harm.\u201d Ante,\nat 9 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But much damage is caused,\nboth to real award recipients and to the system of mili-\ntary honors, by false statements that are not linked to\nany financial or other tangible reward. Unless even a\nsmall financial loss\u2014say, a dollar given to a homeless man\nfalsely claiming to be a decorated veteran\u2014is more im-\nportant in the eyes of the First Amendment than the\ndamage caused to the very integrity of the military awards\nsystem, there is no basis for distinguishing between the\nStolen Valor Act and the alternative statutes that the\nplurality and concurrence appear willing to sustain.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Inaddition, since the Department may not disclose the Social Secu-\nrity numbers or birthdates of recipients, this database would be of\nlimited use in ascertaining the veracity of a claim involving a person\nwith a common name.

In-\nstead, the statute is based on the need to protect \u201cagencies\nfrom the perversion which might result from the deceptive\npractices described.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\n   Still other statutes make it a crime to falsely represent\nthat one is speaking on behalf of, or with the approval of,\nthe Federal Government. See, e.g., 18 U. S.

Barnow, 239\nU. S. 74, 80 (1915)). All told, there are more than 100\nfederal criminal statutes that punish false statements\nmade in connection with areas of federal agency concern.\nSee United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 505\uf02d507, and\nnn. 8\uf02d10 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing \u201cat least\n100 federal false statement statutes\u201d in the United States\nCode).\n  These examples amply demonstrate that false state-\nments of fact merit no First Amendment protection in\ntheir own right.14 It is true, as JUSTICE BREYER notes,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 The plurality rejects this rule. Although we have made clear that\n\u201c[u]ntruthful speech . . . has never been protected for its own sake,\u201d\nVirginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.,\n425 U. S. 748, 771 (1976), the most the plurality is willing to concede is\nthat \u201cthe falsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected,\u201d ante, at\n9. This represents a dramatic\u2014and entirely unjustified\u2014departure\nfrom the sound approach taken in past cases.\n   Respondent and his supporting amici attempt to limit this rule to\ncertain subsets of false statements, see, e.g., Brief for Respondent 53\n(asserting that, at most, only falsity that is proved to cause specific\nharm is stripped of its First Amendment protection), but the examples\ndescribed above belie that attempt. These examples show that the rule\nat least applies to (1) specific types of false statements that were\nneither illegal nor tortious in 1791 (the torts of intentional infliction of\nemotional distress and false-light invasion of privacy did not exist when\nthe First Amendment was adopted); (2) false speech that does not cause\npecuniary harm (the harm remedied by the torts of defamation, inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress, and false-light invasion of privacy\nis often nonpecuniary in nature, as is the harm inflicted by statements\nthat are illegal under \u00a7\u00a7912 and 1001); (3) false speech that does not\ncause detrimental reliance (neither perjury laws nor many of the\nfederal false statement statutes require that anyone actually rely on\nthe false statement); (4) particular false statements that are not shown\nin court to have caused specific harm (damages can be presumed in\ndefamation actions involving knowing or reckless falsehoods, and no\nshowing of specific harm is required in prosecutions under many of the\nfederal false statement statutes); and (5) false speech that does not\ncause harm to a specific individual (the purpose of many of the federal\n12                  UNITED STATES v.

But respondent\u2019s\nfalse claim to have received the Medal of Honor did not\nfall into any of these categories. His lie did not \u201cprevent\nembarrassment, protect privacy, shield a person from\nprejudice, provide the sick with comfort, or preserve a\nchild\u2019s innocence.\u201d Ibid. Nor did his lie \u201cstop a panic or\notherwise preserve calm in the face of danger\u201d or further\nphilosophical or scientific debate. Ibid. Respondent\u2019s\nclaim, like all those covered by the Stolen Valor Act,\nserved no valid purpose.\n   Respondent and others who join him in attacking the\nStolen Valor Act take a different view. Respondent\u2019s brief\nfeatures a veritable paean to lying. According to respond-\nent, his lie about the Medal of Honor was nothing out of\nthe ordinary for 21st-century Americans. \u201cEveryone lies,\u201d\nhe says. Brief for Respondent 10. \u201cWe lie all the time.\u201d\nIbid. \u201c[H]uman beings are constantly forced to choose the\npersona we present to the world, and our choices nearly\nalways involve intentional omissions and misrepresenta-\ntions, if not outright deception.\u201d Id., at 39.

Varat as Amicus Curiae 5.\n   This radical interpretation of the First Amendment is\nnot supported by any precedent of this Court. The lies\ncovered by the Stolen Valor Act have no intrinsic value\nand thus merit no First Amendment protection unless\ntheir prohibition would chill other expression that falls\nwithin the Amendment\u2019s scope. I now turn to that question.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nfalse statement statutes is to protect government processes). \n\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Gertz, 418\nU. S., at 342 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 433\n(1963)). Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful\nspeech on matters of public concern, we have held that\nliability for the defamation of a public official or figure\nrequires proof that defamatory statements were made\nwith knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. See\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279\uf02d280\n(1964) (civil liability); Garrison, 379 U. S., at 74\uf02d75 (crim-\ninal liability). This same requirement applies when public\nofficials and figures seek to recover for the tort of inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress. See Falwell, 485\nU. S., at 55\uf02d56. And we have imposed \u201c[e]xacting proof\nrequirements\u201d in other contexts as well when necessary to\nensure that truthful speech is not chilled. Madigan, 538\nU. S., at 620 (complainant in a fraud action must show\nthat the defendant made a knowingly false statement of\nmaterial fact with the intent to mislead the listener and\nthat he succeeded in doing so); see also BE&K Constr., 536\nU. S., at 531 (regulation of baseless lawsuits limited to\nthose that are both \u201cobjectively baseless and subjectively\nmotivated by an unlawful purpose\u201d); Hartlage, 456 U. S.,\nat 61 (sustaining as-applied First Amendment challenge to\nlaw prohibiting certain \u201cfactual misstatements in the\ncourse of political debate\u201d where there had been no show-\ning that the disputed statement was made \u201cother than in\ngood faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or . . . with\nreckless disregard as to whether it was false or not\u201d). All\nof these proof requirements inevitably have the effect of\n14              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbringing some false factual statements within the protec-\ntion of the First Amendment, but this is justified in order\nto prevent the chilling of other, valuable speech.\n   These examples by no means exhaust the circumstances\nin which false factual statements enjoy a degree of in-\nstrumental constitutional protection. On the contrary,\nthere are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to\npenalize purportedly false speech would present a grave\nand unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.\nLaws restricting false statements about philosophy, reli-\ngion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and other mat-\nters of public concern would present such a threat. The\npoint is not that there is no such thing as truth or falsity\nin these areas or that the truth is always impossible to\nascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state\nto be the arbiter of truth.\n   Even where there is a wide scholarly consensus concern-\ning a particular matter, the truth is served by allowing\nthat consensus to be challenged without fear of reprisal.\nToday\u2019s accepted wisdom sometimes turns out to be mis-\ntaken. And in these contexts, \u201c[e]ven a false statement\nmay be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public\ndebate, since it brings about \u2018the clearer perception and\nlivelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with\nerror.\u2019 \u201d Sullivan, supra, at 279, n. 19 (quoting J. Mill, On\nLiberty 15 (R. McCallum ed. 1947)).\n   Allowing the state to proscribe false statements in these\nareas also opens the door for the state to use its power for\npolitical ends. Statements about history illustrate this\npoint. If some false statements about historical events\nmay be banned, how certain must it be that a statement is\nfalse before the ban may be upheld? And who should\nmake that calculation? While our cases prohibiting view-\npoint discrimination would fetter the state\u2019s power to some\ndegree, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 384\uf02d390\n(1992) (explaining that the First Amendment does not\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The speech punished by the\nAct is not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in\nintrinsic value, but it also fails to serve any instrumen-\ntal purpose that the First Amendment might protect. Tell-\ningly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech\nthe Stolen Valor Act might chill, even respondent\u2019s counsel\nconceded that the answer is none. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.\n                              C\n   Neither of the two opinions endorsed by Justices in the\nmajority claims that the false statements covered by the\nStolen Valor Act possess either intrinsic or instrumental\nvalue. Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the\ndistinct concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.\nSee ante, at 10 (plurality opinion) (the Act applies to \u201cper-\nsonal, whispered conversations within a home\u201d); ante, at 8\n(BREYER, J., concurring in judgment) (the Act \u201capplies in\nfamily, social, or other private contexts\u201d and in \u201cpolitical\ncontexts\u201d). But to strike down a statute on the basis that\nit is overbroad, it is necessary to show that the statute\u2019s\n\u201coverbreadth [is] substantial, not only in an absolute\nsense, but also relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d\nUnited States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 292 (2008); see\nalso ibid. (noting that this requirement has been \u201cvigor-\nously enforced\u201d). The plurality and the concurrence do not\neven attempt to make this showing.\n   The plurality additionally worries that a decision sus-\ntaining the Stolen Valor Act might prompt Congress and\nthe state legislatures to enact laws criminalizing lies\n16              UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nabout \u201can endless list of subjects.\u201d Ante, at 11. The plu-\nrality apparently fears that we will see laws making it a\ncrime to lie about civilian awards such as college degrees\nor certificates of achievement in the arts and sports.\n  This concern is likely unfounded. With very good rea-\nson, military honors have traditionally been regarded as\nquite different from civilian awards. Nearly a century ago,\nCongress made it a crime to wear a military medal with-\nout authorization; we have no comparable tradition re-\ngarding such things as Super Bowl rings, Oscars, or Phi\nBeta Kappa keys.\n  In any event, if the plurality\u2019s concern is not entirely\nfanciful, it falls outside the purview of the First Amend-\nment. The problem that the plurality foresees\u2014that\nlegislative bodies will enact unnecessary and overly intru-\nsive criminal laws\u2014applies regardless of whether the laws\nin question involve speech or nonexpressive conduct. If\nthere is a problem with, let us say, a law making it a\ncriminal offense to falsely claim to have been a high school\nvaledictorian, the problem is not the suppression of speech\nbut the misuse of the criminal law, which should be re-\nserved for conduct that inflicts or threatens truly serious\nsocietal harm. The objection to this hypothetical law\nwould be the same as the objection to a law making it a\ncrime to eat potato chips during the graduation ceremony\nat which the high school valedictorian is recognized. The\nsafeguard against such laws is democracy, not the First\nAmendment. Not every foolish law is unconstitutional.\n  The Stolen Valor Act represents the judgment of the\npeople\u2019s elected representatives that false statements\nabout military awards are very different from false state-\nments about civilian awards. Certainly this is true with\nrespect to the high honor that respondent misappropri-\nated. Respondent claimed that he was awarded the Medal of\nHonor in 1987 for bravery during the Iran hostage crisis.\nThis singular award, however, is bestowed only on those\n                    Cite as: 567 U.
