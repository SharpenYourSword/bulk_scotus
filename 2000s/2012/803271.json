In No. 10−9647, petitioner Jackson accompanied two\n  other boys to a video store to commit a robbery; on the way to the\n  store, he learned that one of the boys was carrying a shotgun. Jack-\n  son stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he en-\n  tered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk. Ar-\n  kansas charged Jackson as an adult with capital felony murder and\n  aggravated robbery, and a jury convicted him of both crimes. The\n  trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprison-\n  ment without the possibility of parole. Jackson filed a state habeas\n  petition, arguing that a mandatory life-without-parole term for a 14-\n  year-old violates the Eighth Amendment. Disagreeing, the court\n  granted the State’s motion to dismiss. The Arkansas Supreme Court\n  affirmed.\n     In No. 10−9646, petitioner Miller, along with a friend, beat Miller’s\n  neighbor and set fire to his trailer after an evening of drinking and\n  drug use. The neighbor died. Miller was initially charged as a juve-\n  nile, but his case was removed to adult court, where he was charged\n  with murder in the course of arson. A jury found Miller guilty, and\n  the trial court imposed a statutorily mandated punishment of life\n  without parole.

Hobbs, Director, Arkansas\nDepartment of Correction, on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkan-\nsas.\n2                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    the Eighth Amendment.\nHeld: The Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that man-\n dates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile homicide\n offenders. Pp. 6−27.\n    (a) The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual pun-\n ishment “guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to ex-\n cessive sanctions.” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560. That right\n “flows from the basic ‘precept of justice that punishment for crime\n should be graduated and proportioned’ ” to both the offender and the\n offense. Ibid.\n    Two strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate\n punishment come together here. The first has adopted categorical\n bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the cul-\n pability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See, e.g.,\n Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407. Several cases in this group\n have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser\n culpability. Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the Eighth Amend-\n ment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida,\n 560 U. S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of\n life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a non-\n homicide offense. Graham further likened life without parole for ju-\n veniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.\n In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to\n consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his of-\n fense before sentencing him to death. See, e.g., Woodson v. North\n Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (plurality opinion). Here, the confluence of\n these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\n life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.\n    As to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that chil-\n dren are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purpos-\n es. Their “ ‘lack of maturity’ ” and “ ‘underdeveloped sense of respon-\n sibility’ ” lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.\n Roper, 543 U. S., at 569. They “are more vulnerable . . . to negative\n influences and outside pressures,” including from their family and\n peers; they have limited “contro[l] over their own environment” and\n lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\n settings. Ibid. And because a child’s character is not as “well\n formed” as an adult’s, his traits are “less fixed” and his actions are\n less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].” Id., at 570.\n Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of\n youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harsh-\n est sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible\n crimes.\n    While Graham’s flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomi-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crime-\nspecific. Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sen-\ntence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to non-\nhomicide offenses. Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth\nmatters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarcera-\ntion without the possibility of parole. The mandatory penalty\nschemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from consider-\ning youth and from assessing whether the law’s harshest term of im-\nprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. This con-\ntravenes Graham’s (and also Roper’s) foundational principle: that\nimposition of a State’s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders\ncannot proceed as though they were not children.\n   Graham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty. That decision recognized that life-without-parole\nsentences “share some characteristics with death sentences that are\nshared by no other sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___. And it treated life\nwithout parole for juveniles like this Court’s cases treat the death\npenalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide\noffenses. By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Court’s cases de-\nmanding individualized sentencing in capital cases. In particular,\nthose cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consid-\ner the mitigating qualities of youth. In light of Graham’s reasoning,\nthese decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-\nwithout-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Pp. 6−17.\n   (b) The counterarguments of Alabama and Arkansas are unpersua-\nsive. Pp. 18–27.\n        (1) The States first contend that Harmelin v. Michigan, 501\nU. S. 957, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. Harmelin de-\nclined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to non-\ncapital cases “because of the qualitative difference between death and\nall other penalties.” Id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But Harmelin had nothing to do with chil-\ndren, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders. Indeed,\nsince Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sen-\ntencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Graham, 560 U. S ___.\n   The States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms\nfor juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions im-\npose them on at least some children convicted of murder. In consid-\nering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole,\nthis Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enact-\nments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus\n4                          MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against a sentence for a particular class of offenders. But where, as\n    here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead re-\n    quires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has\n    not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.\n    See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, 483 U. S. 66.\n       In any event, the “objective indicia of society’s standards,” Graham,\n    560 U. S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases\n    from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the Eighth\n    Amendment. Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole\n    sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty\n    (life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invali-\n    dated in Graham. And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487\n    U. S. 815, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can pre-\n    sent a distorted view. In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty\n    applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed\n    the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another\n    set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there. In those cir-\n    cumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a\n    legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so\n    if presented with the choice). The same is true here. Pp. 18–25.\n           (2) The States next argue that courts and prosecutors suffi-\n    ciently consider a juvenile defendant’s age, as well as his background\n    and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him\n    as an adult. But this argument ignores that many States use manda-\n    tory transfer systems. In addition, some lodge the decision in the\n    hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts. And even where judges\n    have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the deci-\n    sionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child\n    or the circumstances of his offense. Finally, because of the limited\n    sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may\n    present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard\n    sentencing as an adult. It cannot substitute for discretion at post-\n    trial sentencing.

In neither case did the sentenc-\ning authority have any discretion to impose a different\npunishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die\nin prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that\nhis youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the\nnature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example,\nlife with the possibility of parole) more appropriate. Such\na scheme prevents those meting out punishment from\nconsidering a juvenile’s “lessened culpability” and greater\n“capacity for change,” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,\n2                    MILLER v.

In a separate opinion, Judge Cobb agreed on the reigning\nprecedent, but urged the State Supreme Court to revisit the question in\nlight of transfer hearings’ importance. See id., at 1081 (“[A]lthough\nlater mental evaluation as an adult affords some semblance of proce-\ndural due process, it is, in effect, too little, too late”).\n6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmum punishment of life without parole. See Ala. Code\n§§13A–5–40(9), 13A–6–2(c) (1982).\n  Relying in significant part on testimony from Smith,\nwho had pleaded to a lesser offense, a jury found Miller\nguilty. He was therefore sentenced to life without the\npossibility of parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed, ruling that life without parole was “not\noverly harsh when compared to the crime” and that the\nmandatory nature of the sentencing scheme was permissi-\nble under the Eighth Amendment. 63 So. 3d, at 690; see\nid., at 686–691. The Alabama Supreme Court denied\nreview.\n  We granted certiorari in both cases, see 565 U. S. ___\n(2011) (No. 10–9646); 565 U. S. ___ (2011) (No. 10–9647),\nand now reverse.\n                             II\n   The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and un-\nusual punishment “guarantees individuals the right not to\nbe subjected to excessive sanctions.” Roper, 543 U. S., at\n560. That right, we have explained, “flows from the basic\n‘precept of justice that punishment for crime should be\ngraduated and proportioned’ ” to both the offender and the\noffense. Ibid. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U. S.\n349, 367 (1910)). As we noted the last time we consid-\nered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles,\n“[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth\nAmendment.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nAnd we view that concept less through a historical prism\nthan according to “ ‘the evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ” Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles,\n356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\n   The cases before us implicate two strands of precedent\nreflecting our concern with proportionate punishment.\nThe first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npractices based on mismatches between the culpability of\na class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9–10) (listing cases).\nSo, for example, we have held that imposing the death\npenalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or\nimposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the\nEighth Amendment. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S.\n407 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002). Sev-\neral of the cases in this group have specially focused on\njuvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.\nThus, Roper held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital\npunishment for children, and Graham concluded that the\nAmendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomi-\ncide offense. Graham further likened life without parole\nfor juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking\na second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have\nprohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment,\nrequiring that sentencing authorities consider the charac-\nteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before\nsentencing him to death. See Woodson v. North Carolina,\n428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio,\n438 U. S. 586 (1978). Here, the confluence of these two\nlines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the\nEighth Amendment.4\n——————\n  4 The  three dissenting opinions here each take issue with some or all\nof those precedents. See post, at 5–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 1–6 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 1–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That\nis not surprising: their authors (and joiner) each dissented from some or\nall of those precedents. See, e.g., Kennedy, 554 U. S., at 447 (ALITO, J.,\njoined by ROBERTS, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., dissenting);\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 607 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nAtkins, 536 U. S., at 337 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning); Thompson, 487 U. S., at 859 ((SCALIA, J., dissenting); Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (contending\nthat Woodson was wrongly decided). In particular, each disagreed with\n8                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  To start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham\nestablish that children are constitutionally different from\nadults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have\ndiminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\nwe explained, “they are less deserving of the most severe\npunishments.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).\nThose cases relied on three significant gaps between juve-\nniles and adults. First, children have a “ ‘lack of maturity\nand an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,’ ” leading to\nrecklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Roper,\n543 U. S., at 569. Second, children “are more vulner-\nable . . . to negative influences and outside pressures,”\nincluding from their family and peers; they have limited\n“contro[l] over their own environment” and lack the ability\nto extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\nsettings. Ibid. And third, a child’s character is not as\n“well formed” as an adult’s; his traits are “less fixed” and\nhis actions less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e]\ndeprav[ity].” Id., at 570.\n  Our decisions rested not only on common sense—on\nwhat “any parent knows”—but on science and social sci-\nence as well. Id., at 569. In Roper, we cited studies\nshowing that “‘[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adoles-\ncents’ ” who engage in illegal activity “ ‘develop entrenched\npatterns of problem behavior.’ ” Id., at 570 (quoting Stein-\nberg & Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: De-\nvelopmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and\nthe Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009,\n——————\nthe majority’s reasoning in Graham, which is the foundation stone of\nour analysis. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring\nin judgment) (slip op., at 1); id., at ___ (THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA\nand ALITO, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 1–25); id., at ___ (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 1). While the dissents seek to relitigate old\nEighth Amendment battles, repeating many arguments this Court has\npreviously (and often) rejected, we apply the logic of Roper, Graham,\nand our individualized sentencing decisions to these two cases.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1014 (2003)). And in Graham, we noted that “develop-\nments in psychology and brain science continue to show\nfundamental differences between juvenile and adult\nminds”—for example, in “parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).5 We\nreasoned that those findings—of transient rashness, pro-\nclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences—both\nlessened a child’s “moral culpability” and enhanced the\nprospect that, as the years go by and neurological devel-\nopment occurs, his “ ‘deficiencies will be reformed.’ ” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570).\n   Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive at-\ntributes of youth diminish the penological justifications\nfor imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders,\neven when they commit terrible crimes. Because “ ‘[t]he\nheart of the retribution rationale’ ” relates to an offender’s\nblameworthiness, “ ‘the case for retribution is not as strong\nwith a minor as with an adult.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 20–21) (quoting Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.\n137, 149 (1987); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Nor can deter-\nrence do the work in this context, because “ ‘the same\ncharacteristics that render juveniles less culpable than\nadults’ ”—their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuos-\nity—make them less likely to consider potential punish-\n——————\n  5 The evidence presented to us in these cases indicates that the sci-\n\nence and social science supporting Roper’s and Graham’s conclusions\nhave become even stronger. See, e.g., Brief for American Psychologi-\ncal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (“[A]n ever-growing body of\nresearch in developmental psychology and neuroscience continues to\nconfirm and strengthen the Court’s conclusions”); id., at 4 (“It is in-\ncreasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in\nregions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as\nimpulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance”); Brief for J.\nLawrence Aber et al. as Amici Curiae 12–28 (discussing post-Graham\nstudies); id., at 26–27 (“Numerous studies post-Graham indicate that\nexposure to deviant peers leads to increased deviant behavior and is a\nconsistent predictor of adolescent delinquency” (footnote omitted)).\n10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 571). Similarly, incapacitation could\nnot support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham:\nDeciding that a “juvenile offender forever will be a danger\nto society” would require “mak[ing] a judgment that [he]\nis incorrigible”—but “ ‘incorrigibility is inconsistent with\nyouth.’ ” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (quoting Work-\nman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App.\n1968)). And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not\njustify that sentence. Life without parole “forswears\naltogether the rehabilitative ideal.” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 23). It reflects “an irrevocable judgment\nabout [an offender’s] value and place in society,” at odds\nwith a child’s capacity for change. Ibid.\n  Graham concluded from this analysis that life-without-\nparole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate\nthe Eighth Amendment when imposed on children. To be\nsure, Graham’s flat ban on life without parole applied only\nto nonhomicide crimes, and the Court took care to distin-\nguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral\nculpability and consequential harm. See id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18). But none of what it said about children—about\ntheir distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and en-\nvironmental vulnerabilities—is crime-specific.         Those\nfeatures are evident in the same way, and to the same de-\ngree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns\ninto a killing. So Graham’s reasoning implicates any life-\nwithout-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its\ncategorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.\n  Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters\nin determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incar-\nceration without the possibility of parole. In the circum-\nstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-without-\nparole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a\nsimilar crime. And in other contexts as well, the charac-\nteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npunishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence\ndisproportionate. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 20–23) (gener-\nally doubting the penological justifications for imposing\nlife without parole on juveniles). “An offender’s age,” we\nmade clear in Graham, “is relevant to the Eighth Amend-\nment,” and so “criminal procedure laws that fail to take\ndefendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be\nflawed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25). THE CHIEF JUSTICE,\nconcurring in the judgment, made a similar point. Al-\nthough rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles, he acknowledged “Roper’s conclu-\nsion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,”\nand accordingly wrote that “an offender’s juvenile status\ncan play a central role” in considering a sentence’s propor-\ntionality. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6); see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (Graham’s “youth is one factor, among others,\nthat should be considered in deciding whether his pun-\nishment was unconstitutionally excessive”).6\n   But the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here pre-\nvent the sentencer from taking account of these central\nconsiderations. By removing youth from the balance—\nby subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole\nsentence applicable to an adult—these laws prohibit a\nsentencing authority from assessing whether the law’s\nharshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a\njuvenile offender. That contravenes Graham’s (and also\nRoper’s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State’s\n——————\n   6 In discussing Graham, the dissents essentially ignore all of this\n\nreasoning. See post, at 3–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 4\n(opinion of ALITO, J.). Indeed, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ignores the points\nmade in his own concurring opinion. The only part of Graham that the\ndissents see fit to note is the distinction it drew between homicide and\nnonhomicide offenses. See post, at 7–8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But contrary to the dissents’ charge, our\ndecision today retains that distinction: Graham established one rule (a\nflat ban) for nonhomicide offenses, while we set out a different one\n(individualized sentencing) for homicide offenses.\n12                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed\nas though they were not children.\n   And Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes’\ndefects in another way: by likening life-without-parole\nsentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.\nLife-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, “share some\ncharacteristics with death sentences that are shared by no\nother sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). Im-\nprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of\nhis life “by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.” Ibid. (citing\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300–301 (1983)). And this\nlengthiest possible incarceration is an “especially harsh\npunishment for a juvenile,” because he will almost inevi-\ntably serve “more years and a greater percentage of his life\nin prison than an adult offender.” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19–20). The penalty when imposed on a\nteenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore\n“the same . . . in name only.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).\nAll of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part\nbecause we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as\nakin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that\nmost severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on\nthe sentence’s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of\nimprisonment. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (“For the first time\nin its history, the Court declares an entire class of offend-\ners immune from a noncapital sentence using the categori-\ncal approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases\nalone”). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription\nfirst established in the death penalty context—that the\npunishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide\ncrimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407;\nCoker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).\n   That correspondence—Graham’s “[t]reat[ment] [of]\njuvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punish-\nment,” 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment) (slip op., at 5)—makes relevant here a second\nline of our precedents, demanding individualized sentenc-\ning when imposing the death penalty. In Woodson, 428\nU. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sen-\ntence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amend-\nment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because\nit gave no significance to “the character and record of\nthe individual offender or the circumstances” of the offense,\nand “exclud[ed] from consideration . . . the possibility of\ncompassionate or mitigating factors.” Id., at 304. Subse-\nquent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that\ncapital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and\nthe judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating fac-\ntors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the\nmost culpable defendants committing the most serious\noffenses. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74–\n76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112\n(1982); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 597–609 (plurality opinion).\n   Of special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings\nthat a sentencer have the ability to consider the “mitigat-\ning qualities of youth.” Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,\n367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham\nabout that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As\nwe observed, “youth is more than a chronological fact.”\nEddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, ir-\nresponsibility, “impetuousness[,] and recklessness.” John-\nson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and “condition\nof life when a person may be most susceptible to influence\nand to psychological damage.” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115.\nAnd its “signature qualities” are all “transient.” Johnson,\n509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a\n16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed\nhim. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge\ndid not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent\nfamily background (including his mother’s drug abuse and\nhis father’s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.\n14                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nWe found that evidence “particularly relevant”—more so\nthan it would have been in the case of an adult offender.\n455 U. S., at 115. We held: “[J]ust as the chronological age\nof a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great\nweight, so must the background and mental and emotional\ndevelopment of a youthful defendant be duly considered”\nin assessing his culpability. Id., at 116.\n   In light of Graham’s reasoning, these decisions too show\nthe flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sen-\ntences on juvenile homicide offenders. Such mandatory\npenalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from\ntaking account of an offender’s age and the wealth of\ncharacteristics and circumstances attendant to it. Under\nthese schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sen-\ntence as every other—the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old,\nthe shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable\nhousehold and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.\nAnd still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14-\nyear-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast ma-\njority of adults committing similar homicide offenses—but\nreally, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those\nadults will serve.7 In meting out the death penalty, the\nelision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden.\nAnd once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule\nshould apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life\n(and death) in prison.\n   So Graham and Roper and our individualized sentenc-\n\n——————\n   7 Although adults are subject as well to the death penalty in many\n\njurisdictions, very few offenders actually receive that sentence. See,\ne.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M.\nDurose, & D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2006—\nStatistical Tables, p. 28 (Table 4.4) (rev. Nov. 22, 2010). So in practice,\nthe sentencing schemes at issue here result in juvenile homicide\noffenders receiving the same nominal punishment as almost all adults,\neven though the two classes differ significantly in moral culpability and\ncapacity for change.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning cases alike teach that in imposing a State’s harshest\npenalties, a sentencer misses too much if he treats every\nchild as an adult. To recap: Mandatory life without parole\nfor a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological\nage and its hallmark features—among them, immaturity,\nimpetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and conse-\nquences. It prevents taking into account the family and\nhome environment that surrounds him—and from which\nhe cannot usually extricate himself—no matter how bru-\ntal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the\nhomicide offense, including the extent of his participation\nin the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures\nmay have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might\nhave been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not\nfor incompetencies associated with youth—for example,\nhis inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors\n(including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist\nhis own attorneys. See, e.g., Graham, 560 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 27) (“[T]he features that distinguish juveniles\nfrom adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in\ncriminal proceedings”); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6) (discussing children’s\nresponses to interrogation). And finally, this mandatory\npunishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation\neven when the circumstances most suggest it.\n   Both cases before us illustrate the problem. Take Jack-\nson’s first. As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet\nthat killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that\nhe intended her death. Jackson’s conviction was instead\nbased on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate\ncourt affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have\nbelieved that when Jackson entered the store, he warned\nTroup that “[w]e ain’t playin’,” rather than told his friends\nthat “I thought you all was playin’.” See 359 Ark., at\n90–92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 759–760; supra, at 2. To be sure,\nJackson learned on the way to the video store that his\n16                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfriend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well\nhave affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well\nas his willingness to walk away at that point. All these\ncircumstances go to Jackson’s culpability for the offense.\nSee Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (“[W]hen\ncompared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who\ndid not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral\nculpability”). And so too does Jackson’s family background\nand immersion in violence: Both his mother and his\ngrandmother had previously shot other individuals. See\nRecord in No. 10–9647, pp. 80–82. At the least, a sen-\ntencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14-\nyear-old of any prospect of release from prison.\n   That is true also in Miller’s case. No one can doubt that\nhe and Smith committed a vicious murder. But they did it\nwhen high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult\nvictim. And if ever a pathological background might have\ncontributed to a 14-year-old’s commission of a crime, it is\nhere. Miller’s stepfather physically abused him; his alco-\nholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had\nbeen in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried\nto kill himself four times, the first when he should have\nbeen in kindergarten. See 928 So. 2d, at 1081 (Cobb, J.,\nconcurring in result); Miller App. 26–28; supra, at 4.\nNonetheless, Miller’s past criminal history was limited—\ntwo instances of truancy and one of “second-degree crimi-\nnal mischief.” No. CR–03–0915, at 6 (unpublished memo-\nrandum). That Miller deserved severe punishment for\nkilling Cole Cannon is beyond question. But once again,\na sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances\nbefore concluding that life without any possibility of parole\nwas the appropriate penalty.\n   We therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a\nsentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without\npossibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (“A State is not required\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto guarantee eventual freedom,” but must provide “some\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon-\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation”). By making youth\n(and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of\nthat harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too\ngreat a risk of disproportionate punishment. Because that\nholding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not con-\nsider Jackson’s and Miller’s alternative argument that\nthe Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life\nwithout parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and\nyounger. But given all we have said in Roper, Graham,\nand this decision about children’s diminished culpability\nand heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate\noccasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible\npenalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because\nof the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of\ndistinguishing at this early age between “the juvenile of-\nfender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient\nimmaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime\nreflects irreparable corruption.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 573;\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Although we do\nnot foreclose a sentencer’s ability to make that judgment\nin homicide cases, we require it to take into account how\nchildren are different, and how those differences coun-\nsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in\nprison.8\n——————\n  8 Given  our holding, and the dissents’ competing position, we see a\ncertain irony in their repeated references to 17-year-olds who have\ncommitted the “most heinous” offenses, and their comparison of those\ndefendants to the 14-year-olds here. See post, at 2 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.) (noting the “17-year old [who] is convicted of deliberately murder-\ning an innocent victim”); post, at 3 (“the most heinous murders”); post,\nat 7 (“the worst types of murder”); post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.)\n(warning the reader not to be “confused by the particulars” of these two\ncases); post, at 1 (discussing the “171⁄2-year-old who sets off a bomb in\na crowded mall”). Our holding requires factfinders to attend to exactly\nsuch circumstances—to take into account the differences among de-\n18                       MILLER v.

The States (along with the dissents) first\ncontend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of\nour Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert\nthat the rule is unnecessary because individualized cir-\ncumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a\njuvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are\nwrong on both counts.\n                                    A\n  The States (along with JUSTICE THOMAS) first claim that\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our\nholding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a\nmandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more\nthan 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that pen-\nalty, reasoning that “a sentence which is not otherwise cruel\nand unusual” does not “becom[e] so simply because it is\n‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. We recognized that a different\nrule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the\ndeath penalty context. But we refused to extend that\ncommand to noncapital cases “because of the qualitative\ndifference between death and all other penalties.” Ibid.;\nsee id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). According to Alabama, invali-\ndating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole\nterms on juveniles “would effectively overrule Harmelin.”\nBrief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 59 (hereinafter\nAlabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.\n  We think that argument myopic. Harmelin had nothing\nto do with children and did not purport to apply its hold-\n—————— \n\nfendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes that the\n        \n\ndissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors. \n\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning to the sentencing of juvenile offenders. We have by\nnow held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule\npermissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital\npunishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with\nthe Eighth Amendment—except it cannot be imposed on\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S.\n815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhom-\nicide offenses—except, once again, for children. See Gra-\nham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Nor are these\nsentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary,\n“ ‘[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recogni-\ntion’ that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature\nadults.” J. D. B., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115–116, citing examples\nfrom criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as\nHarmelin recognized) “death is different,” children are\ndifferent too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not\nhave some form of exception for children. In that context,\nit is no surprise that the law relating to society’s harshest\npunishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 7) (“Graham’s age places him in a significantly\ndifferent category from the defendan[t] in . . . Harmelin”).\nOur ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor con-\nflicts with Harmelin.\n    Alabama and Arkansas (along with THE CHIEF JUS-\nTICE and JUSTICE ALITO) next contend that because many\nStates impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on\njuveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.\nIn considering categorical bars to the death penalty and\nlife without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether\n“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in\nlegislative enactments and state practice,’ ” show a “na-\ntional consensus” against a sentence for a particular class\nof offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 juris-\n20                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make\na life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles\nconvicted of murder in adult court.9 The States argue that\nthis number precludes our holding.\n  We do not agree; indeed, we think the States’ argument\non this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.\nFor starters, the cases here are different from the typical\none in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our\ndecision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class\nof offenders or type of crime—as, for example, we did in\nRoper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sen-\ntencer follow a certain process—considering an offender’s\nyouth and attendant characteristics—before imposing a\nparticular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows\nstraightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the\nprinciple of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sen-\ntencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting\nout the law’s most serious punishments. When both of\nthose circumstances have obtained in the past, we have\nnot scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative\n——————\n  9 The  States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make\nlife without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punish-\nment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision\nto 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants).\nSee Alabama Brief 17–18. In addition, life without parole is mandatory\nfor older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See\nLa. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §§14:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex. Family Code\nAnn. §§51.02(2)(A), 54.02(a)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2011); Tex. Penal Code\nAnn. §12.31(a) (West 2011). In many of these jurisdictions, life without\nparole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of\nmurder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have\nconsistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to\nparticular kinds of murder cannot cure the law’s “constitutional vice” of\ndisregarding the “circumstances of the particular offense and the\ncharacter and propensities of the offender.” Roberts v. Louisiana, 428\nU. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483\nU. S. 66 (1987). The same analysis applies here, for the same reasons.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenactments. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66\n(relying on Woodson’s logic to prohibit the mandatory\ndeath penalty for murderers already serving life without\nparole); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 602–608 (plurality opinion)\n(applying Woodson to require that judges and juries\nconsider all mitigating evidence); Eddings, 455 U. S., at\n110–117 (similar). We see no difference here.\n  In any event, the “objective indicia” that the States offer\ndo not distinguish these cases from others holding that\na sentencing practice violates the Eighth Amendment. In\nGraham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for\njuveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though\n39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). That is 10 more than impose life\nwithout parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis.10 And\n——————\n   10 In assessing indicia of societal standards, Graham discussed “ac-\n\ntual sentencing practices” in addition to legislative enactments, noting\nhow infrequently sentencers imposed the statutorily available penalty.\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Here, we consider the constitutional-\nity of mandatory sentencing schemes—which by definition remove a\njudge’s or jury’s discretion—so no comparable gap between legislation\nand practice can exist. Rather than showing whether sentencers\nconsider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate,\nthe number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 1, 3–4\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have com-\nmitted homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions. For the same\nreason, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s comparison of ratios in this case and Gra-\nham carries little weight. He contrasts the number of mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the\nnumber of juveniles arrested for murder, with “the corresponding\nnumber” of sentences in Graham (i.e., the number of life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as\ncompared to arrests for those crimes). Post, at 4. But because the\nmandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more\ncommon, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s figures do not “correspon[d]” at all. The\nhigher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer’s discretion.\n   Where mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number\nof juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of\npractice supports our holding. Fifteen jurisdictions make life without\n22                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin Atkins, Roper, and Thompson, we similarly banned the\ndeath penalty in circumstances in which “less than half ”\nof the “States that permit[ted] capital punishment (for\nwhom the issue exist[ed])” had previously chosen to do so.\nAtkins, 536 U. S., at 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis\ndeleted); see id., at 313–315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543\nU. S., at 564–565; Thompson, 487 U. S., at 826–827 (plu-\nrality opinion). So we are breaking no new ground in\nthese cases.11\n  Graham and Thompson provide special guidance, be-\ncause they considered the same kind of statutes we do and\n——————\nparole discretionary for juveniles. See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12\nStates); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code §35–50–\n2–3(b) (2011); N. M. Stat. §§31–18–13(B), 31–18–14, 31–18–15.2 (2010).\nAccording to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-without-\nparole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from\nthe 29 mandatory ones. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–9646, p. 19;\nHuman Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serv-\ning Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online at\nhttp://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offenders-\nserving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). That figure indicates that when\ngiven the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children\nrelatively rarely. And contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument, see\npost, at 5, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often\nchoose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295–296 (1976) (plurality\nopinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the\ndeath penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposi-\ntion violates the Eighth Amendment).\n   11 In response, THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains: “To say that a sentence\n\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it\nstands precedent on its head.” Post, at 5. To be clear: That description\nin no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates\nthe Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it\nconflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham, and our\nindividualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of\nStates imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and\nnote how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it)\nmakes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 23\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained why simply counting them would present a\ndistorted view. Most jurisdictions authorized the death\npenalty or life without parole for juveniles only through\nthe combination of two independent statutory provisions.\nOne allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to\nadult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of\nthe code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals\ntried there. We reasoned that in those circumstances, it\nwas impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed\na given penalty for children (or would do so if presented\nwith the choice). In Thompson, we found that the statutes\n“t[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old\nenough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or\ntoo old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court),\nbut t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States\nhave made regarding the appropriate punishment for such\nyouthful offenders.” 487 U. S., at 826, n. 24 (plurality\nopinion) (emphasis deleted); see also id., at 850 (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring in judgment); Roper, 543 U. S., at 596, n.\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting). And Graham echoed that\nreasoning: Although the confluence of state laws “ma[de]\nlife without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide\noffenders,” it did not “justify a judgment” that many\nStates actually “intended to subject such offenders” to\nthose sentences. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).12\n   All that is just as true here. Almost all jurisdictions\nallow some juveniles to be tried in adult court for some\n——————\n  12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE attempts to distinguish Graham on this point,\n\narguing that there “the extreme rarity with which the sentence in\nquestion was imposed could suggest that legislatures did not really\nintend the inevitable result of the laws they passed.” Post, at 6. But\nneither Graham nor Thompson suggested such reasoning, presumably\nbecause the time frame makes it difficult to comprehend. Those cases\nconsidered what legislators intended when they enacted, at different\nmoments, separate juvenile-transfer and life-without-parole provi-\nsions—by definition, before they knew or could know how many juve-\nnile life-without-parole sentences would result.\n24                      MILLER v.

Snyder & M.\nSickmund, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 2006 National\nReport 110–114 (hereinafter 2006 National Report). But\nmost States do not have separate penalty provisions for\nthose juvenile offenders. Of the 29 jurisdictions mandat-\ning life without parole for children, more than half do so\nby virtue of generally applicable penalty provisions, im-\nposing the sentence without regard to age.13 And indeed,\nsome of those States set no minimum age for who may be\ntransferred to adult court in the first instance, thus apply-\ning life-without-parole mandates to children of any age—\nbe it 17 or 14 or 10 or 6.14 As in Graham, we think that\n“underscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile\noffender for life without parole does not indicate that the\npenalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express,\nand full legislative consideration.” 560 U.

Of the\n29 relevant jurisdictions, about half place at least some\njuvenile homicide offenders in adult court automatically,\nwith no apparent opportunity to seek transfer to juvenile\ncourt.15 Moreover, several States at times lodge this deci-\nsion exclusively in the hands of prosecutors, again with\nno statutory mechanism for judicial reevaluation.16 And\nthose “prosecutorial discretion laws are usually silent\nregarding standards, protocols, or appropriate considera-\ntions for decisionmaking.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Juve-\nnile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, P.

ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAdults: An Analysis of State Transfer Laws and Reporting\n5 (2011).\n   Even when States give transfer-stage discretion to\njudges, it has limited utility. First, the decisionmaker\ntypically will have only partial information at this early,\npretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances\nof his offense. Miller’s case provides an example. As\nnoted earlier, see n. 3, supra, the juvenile court denied\nMiller’s request for his own mental-health expert at the\ntransfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the\nground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections\nand services he would receive at trial. See No. CR–03–\n0915, at 3–4 (unpublished memorandum). But by then, of\ncourse, the expert’s testimony could not change the sen-\ntence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory\nlife-without-parole prison term would kick in. The key mo-\nment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer—and as\nMiller’s case shows, the judge often does not know then\nwhat she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over\nthe course of the proceedings.\n   Second and still more important, the question at trans-\nfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a\npost-trial sentencing. Because many juvenile systems\nrequire that the offender be released at a particular age or\nafter a certain number of years, transfer decisions often\npresent a choice between extremes: light punishment as a\nchild or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without\nparole). In many States, for example, a child convicted in\njuvenile court must be released from custody by the age of\n21. See, e.g., Ala. Code §12–15–117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011);\nsee generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations\non the length of juvenile court sanctions). Discretionary\nsentencing in adult court would provide different options:\nThere, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a life-\nwithout-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the\npossibility of parole or a lengthy term of years. It is easy\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto imagine a judge deciding that a minor deserves a\n(much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile\ncourt, while still not thinking life-without-parole appro-\npriate. For that reason, the discretion available to a judge\nat the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at\npost-trial sentencing in adult court—and so cannot satisfy\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n                             IV\n   Graham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing\ndecisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the\nopportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before\nimposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles.

I add that, if the State\ncontinues to seek a sentence of life without the possibil-\nity of parole for Kuntrell Jackson, there will have to be a\ndetermination whether Jackson “kill[ed] or intend[ed] to\nkill” the robbery victim. Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). In my view, without such a\nfinding, the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham\nforbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless\nof whether its application is mandatory or discretionary\nunder state law.\n   In Graham we said that “when compared to an adult\nmurderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to\nkill has a twice diminished moral culpability.” Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). For one thing, “compared to adults, juve-\nniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense\n2                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nof responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible\nto negative influences and outside pressures, including\npeer pressure; and their characters are not as well\nformed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also ibid. (“[P]sychology and brain\nscience continue to show fundamental differences between\njuvenile and adult minds” making their actions “less likely\nto be evidence of ‘irretrievably depraved character’ than\nare the actions of adults” (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543\nU. S. 551, 570 (2005))); ante, at 8–9. For another thing,\nGraham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin-\nishes the “moral culpability” that attaches to the crime in\nquestion, making those that do not intend to kill “categori-\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish-\nment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n18) (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 434–435\n(2008); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Tison v.\nArizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987)). And we concluded that,\nbecause of this “twice diminished moral culpability,” the\nEighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles\nof a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases.\nGraham, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 18, 32).\n  Given Graham’s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that\ncan subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must\nexclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills\nnor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile\neither kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks “twice\ndiminished” responsibility. But where the juvenile neither\nkills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra-\nham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would\npermit life without parole for “juveniles who commit the\nworst types of murder,” post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of\none who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\n  I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,\nthe question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nmurder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in\nthe course of a felony to all participants who intended to\ncommit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or\nintended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw §§14.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been\nbased on the idea of “transferred intent”; the defendant’s\nintent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill\nrequired for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.\nStreiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.\n2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton’s Criminal Law §147 (15th ed.\n1994).\n   But in my opinion, this type of “transferred intent” is\nnot sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could\nsubject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As\nan initial matter, this Court has made clear that this\nartificially constructed kind of intent does not count as\nintent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not\nrely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may\nreceive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids\nimposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in\na robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and\nsimply was “in the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting\nto help the robbers escape.” Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.\nTison, supra, at 157–158 (capital punishment permissi-\nble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death\nbecause he was “actively involved” in every aspect of the\nkidnaping and his behavior showed “a reckless disregard\nfor human life”). Given Graham, this holding applies to\njuvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See\nante, at 12–13. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison\nstandard of “reckless disregard” may not be eligible for life\nwithout parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The\nonly juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to\nlife without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses\nwho “kill or intend to kill.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18).\n4                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\n   Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,\nthere is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without\nparole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to\nkill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant’s\nintent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan-\ngerous felony should understand the risk that the victim\nof the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2\nLaFave, supra, §14.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the\nfull consequences of a course of action and to adjust one’s\nconduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles\nlack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8–9. Justice Frank-\nfurter cautioned, “Legal theories and their phrasing in\nother cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit-\nically transferred to a determination of a State’s duty to-\nward children.” May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536\n(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of\ntransferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to\nsentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve\nsuch “fallacious reasoning.” Ibid.\n   This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres-\nent in Kuntrell Jackson’s case. Jackson simply went\nalong with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he\nbecame aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially\nstayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some-\nthing like “We ain’t playin’ ” or “ ‘I thought you all was\nplayin,’ ” before an older confederate shot and killed the\nstore clerk.

W. 3d\n757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of\nfirst-degree murder under a statute that permitted them\nto convict if, Jackson “attempted to commit or committed\nan aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of-\nfense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk’s] death\nunder circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the\nvalue of human life.” Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. §5–10–\n101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,\nJackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Ibid.\n   The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,\nmight not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.\nNorris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ark.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,\nJ., dissenting) (“[A]ny evidence of [Jackson’s] intent to kill\nwas severely lacking”). In that case, the Eighth Amend-\nment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the\npossibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a\nfinding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk’s death,\nthe question remains open whether the Eighth Amend-\nment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a\njuvenile in those circumstances as well.

Our role, however, is to\napply the law, not to answer such questions. The perti-\nnent law here is the Eighth Amendment to the Constitu-\ntion, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.”\nToday, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a pun-\nishment that the Court does not itself characterize as un-\nusual, and that could not plausibly be described as such.\nI therefore dissent.\n   The parties agree that nearly 2,500 prisoners are pres-\nently serving life sentences without the possibility of pa-\nrole for murders they committed before the age of 18.\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 10–9647, p. 62, n. 80 (Jackson\n2                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nBrief ); Brief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 30 (Ala-\nbama Brief ). The Court accepts that over 2,000 of those\nprisoners received that sentence because it was mandated\nby a legislature. Ante, at 22, n. 10. And it recognizes\nthat the Federal Government and most States impose such\nmandatory sentences. Ante, at 19–20. Put simply, if a 17-\nyear-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent\nvictim, it is not “unusual” for the murderer to receive a\nmandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality\nshould preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment\nfor juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our precedent supports this conclusion. When deter-\nmining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this\nCourt typically begins with “ ‘objective indicia of society’s\nstandards, as expressed in legislative enactments and\nstate practice.’ ” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana,\n554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543\nU. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these “objective indicia” to\nensure that we are not simply following our own subjective\nvalues or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173\n(1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).\nSuch tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to\ndetermine whether there is a “consensus against” a given\nsentencing practice. Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n10). If there is, the punishment may be regarded as “un-\nusual.” But when, as here, most States formally require\nand frequently impose the punishment in question, there\nis no objective basis for that conclusion.\n   Our Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we\nshould take guidance from “evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.” Ante, at 6\n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty\ncan be a form of decency, and a maturing society may\nabandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nunnecessary or unjust. But decency is not the same as\nleniency. A decent society protects the innocent from\nviolence. A mature society may determine that this re-\nquires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders\nfrom its midst, both as protection for its other members\nand as a concrete expression of its standards of decency.\nAs judges we have no basis for deciding that progress\ntoward greater decency can move only in the direction of\neasing sanctions on the guilty.\n   In this case, there is little doubt about the direction of\nsociety’s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American\nsentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the\noffender and the availability of parole. But by the 1980’s,\noutcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with\nthe rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legis-\nlatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole,\nimposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals\nand prevent them from committing more crimes. See, e.g.,\nAlschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punish-\nment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 1–13 (2003); see generally\nCrime and Public Policy (J. Wilson & J. Petersilia eds.\n2011). Statutes establishing life without parole sentences\nin particular became more common in the past quarter\ncentury. See Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 78, and n. 10\n(2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the\nparties agree that most States have changed their laws\nrelatively recently to expose teenage murderers to manda-\ntory life without parole. Jackson Brief 54–55; Alabama\nBrief 4–5.\n   The Court attempts to avoid the import of the fact that\nso many jurisdictions have embraced the sentencing prac-\ntice at issue by comparing this case to the Court’s prior\nEighth Amendment cases. The Court notes that Graham\nfound a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions uncon-\nstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is\nmandated in 10 fewer. Ante, at 21. But Graham went to\n4                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconsiderable lengths to show that although theoretically\nallowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case\nwas “exceedingly rare” in practice. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16). The Court explained that only 123 prisoners\nin the entire Nation were serving life without parole for\nnonhomicide crimes committed as juveniles, with more\nthan half in a single State. It contrasted that with statis-\ntics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for\nserious nonhomicide offenses in a single year. Based on\nthe sentence’s rarity despite the many opportunities to im-\npose it, Graham concluded that there was a national\nconsensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhom-\nicide crimes. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–16).\n   Here the number of mandatory life without parole sen-\ntences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of\njuveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher\nthan the corresponding number in Graham. There is thus\nnothing in this case like the evidence of national consen-\nsus in Graham.1\n   The Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the\nprevalence of the sentence in question results from the\nnumber of statutes requiring its imposition. Ante, at 21,\nn. 10. True enough. The sentence at issue is statutorily\nmandated life without parole. Such a sentence can only\nresult from statutes requiring its imposition. In Graham\nthe Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to\nexplain why the high number of statutes allowing such\n——————\n  1 Graham stated that 123 prisoners were serving life without parole\n\nfor nonhomicide offenses committed as juveniles, while in 2007 alone\n380,480 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomicide crimes. 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14). I use 2,000 as the number of prisoners\nserving mandatory life without parole sentences for murders committed\nas juveniles, because all seem to accept that the number is at least that\nhigh. And the same source Graham used reports that 1,170 juveniles\nwere arrested for murder and nonnegligent homicide in 2009. Dept.\nof Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,\nC.

J., dissenting\n\nsentences was not dispositive. Here, the Court excuses\nthe high number of actual sentences by citing the high\nnumber of statutes imposing it. To say that a sentence\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures\napprove it stands precedent on its head.2\n  The Court also advances another reason for discounting\nthe laws enacted by Congress and most state legisla-\ntures. Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life\nwithout parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of\ntwo statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with\nserious crimes may be tried as adults, and another gener-\nally mandating that those convicted of murder be impris-\noned for life. According to the Court, our cases suggest\nthat where the sentence results from the interaction of two\nsuch statutes, the legislature can be considered to have\nimposed the resulting sentences “inadvertent[ly].” Ante,\nat 22–25. The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v.\nOklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24 (1988) (plurality\nopinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore\nnot valid evidence of society’s views on the punishment at\nissue.\n  It is a fair question whether this Court should ever\nassume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it\ndoes not understand that two of them interact with each\n——————\n   2 The Court’s reference to discretionary sentencing practices is a dis-\n\ntraction. See ante, at 21–22, n. 10. The premise of the Court’s decision\nis that mandatory sentences are categorically different from discretion-\nary ones. So under the Court’s own logic, whether discretionary sen-\ntences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether\nmandatory sentences are unusual. In any event, if analysis of discre-\ntionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support\nfor today’s decision. The Court states that “about 15% of all juvenile\nlife-without-parole sentences”—meaning nearly 400 sentences—were\nimposed at the discretion of a judge or jury. Ante, at 22, n. 10. Thus\nthe number of discretionary life without parole sentences for juvenile\nmurderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is\nabout 1,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.\n6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nother, especially on an issue of such importance as the one\nbefore us. But in Graham and Thompson it was at least\nplausible as a practical matter. In Graham, the extreme\nrarity with which the sentence in question was imposed\ncould suggest that legislatures did not really intend the\ninevitable result of the laws they passed. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 15–16). In Thompson, the sentencing\npractice was even rarer—only 20 defendants had received\nit in the last century. 487 U. S., at 832 (plurality opinion).\nPerhaps under those facts it could be argued that the leg-\nislature was not fully aware that a teenager could re-\nceive the particular sentence in question. But here the\nwidespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it\nimplausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a\ncollateral consequence of legislative ignorance.3\n   Nor do we display our usual respect for elected officials\nby asserting that legislators have accidentally required\n2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail. This\nis particularly true given that our well-publicized decision\nin Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that\nteenagers were subject to life with parole only because of\nlegislative inadvertence. I am aware of no effort in the\nwake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative over-\nsight. Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Gra-\nham one legislature made especially clear that it does\nintend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to re-\nceive mandatory life without parole. See Iowa Code Ann.\n§902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).\n   In the end, the Court does not actually conclude that\nmandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are un-\nusual. It instead claims that precedent “leads to” today’s\n\n——————\n    3 The\n        Court claims that I “take issue with some or all of these prece-\ndents” and “seek to relitigate” them.

Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases\n“compels” finding in their favor. Jackson Brief 34. The\nCourt is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only\nthat precedent points in that direction. But today’s deci-\nsion invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and\nCongress. This Court is not easily led to such a result.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883)\n(courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional\n“unless the lack of constitutional authority . . . is clearly\ndemonstrated”). Because the Court does not rely on the\nEighth Amendment’s text or objective evidence of society’s\nstandards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the\n“heavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the\njudgment of the representatives of the people.” Gregg, 428\nU. S., at 175. If the Court is unwilling to say that prece-\ndent compels today’s decision, perhaps it should reconsider\nthat decision.\n  In any event, the Court’s holding does not follow from\nRoper and Graham. Those cases undoubtedly stand for\nthe proposition that teenagers are less mature, less re-\nsponsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults—not\nthat a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that.\nWhat they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is\nthat legislators—who also know that teenagers are differ-\nent from adults—may not require life without parole for\njuveniles who commit the worst types of murder.\n  That Graham does not imply today’s result could not be\nclearer.

Which Graham also said: “defendants who do\nnot kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are\ncategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of\npunishment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18) (emphasis added). Of course, to be especially\nclear that what is said about one issue does not apply to\nanother, one could say that the two issues cannot be com-\npared. Graham said that too: “Serious nonhomicide\ncrimes . . . cannot be compared to murder.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A case that expressly puts an\nissue in a different category from its own subject, draws a\nline between the two, and states that the two should not\nbe compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.\n   Roper provides even less support for the Court’s holding.\nIn that case, the Court held that the death penalty could\nnot be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no\nmatter how serious their crimes. In doing so, Roper also\nset itself in a different category than this case, by ex-\npressly invoking “special” Eighth Amendment analysis for\ndeath penalty cases. 543 U. S., at 568–569. But more\nimportantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was\nnot needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because\n“life imprisonment without the possibility of parole” was\navailable. Id., at 572. In a classic bait and switch, the\nCourt now tells state legislatures that—Roper’s promise\nnotwithstanding—they do not have power to guarantee\nthat once someone commits a heinous murder, he will\nnever do so again. It would be enough if today’s decision\nproved JUSTICE SCALIA’s prescience in writing that Roper’s\n“reassurance . . . gives little comfort.” Id., at 623 (dissent-\ning opinion). To claim that Roper actually “leads to” re-\nvoking its own reassurance surely goes too far.\n   Today’s decision does not offer Roper and Graham’s\nfalse promises of restraint. Indeed, the Court’s opinion\nsuggests that it is merely a way station on the path to\nfurther judicial displacement of the legislative role in\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nprescribing appropriate punishment for crime.          The\nCourt’s analysis focuses on the mandatory nature of the\nsentences in this case. See ante, at 11–17. But then—\nalthough doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it\nannounces—the Court states that even when a life with-\nout parole sentence is not mandatory, “we think appropri-\nate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest\npossible penalty will be uncommon.” Ante, at 17. Today’s\nholding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the\nCourt has already announced that discretionary life with-\nout parole for juveniles should be “uncommon”—or, to use\na common synonym, “unusual.”\n   Indeed, the Court’s gratuitous prediction appears to be\nnothing other than an invitation to overturn life without\nparole sentences imposed by juries and trial judges. If\nthat invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for\njuvenile offenders do in fact become “uncommon,” the\nCourt will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the\nEighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.\n   This process has no discernible end point—or at least\nnone consistent with our Nation’s legal traditions. Roper\nand Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the\ncircumstances they addressed—Roper to the death penalty,\nand Graham to nonhomicide crimes. Having cast aside\nthose limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substi-\ntute, and does not even try. After all, the Court tells us,\n“none of what [Graham] said about children . . . is crime-\nspecific.” Ante, at 10. The principle behind today’s deci-\nsion seems to be only that because juveniles are different\nfrom adults, they must be sentenced differently. See ante,\nat 14–17. There is no clear reason that principle would\nnot bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any\njuvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated\nadult would receive. Unless confined, the only stopping\npoint for the Court’s analysis would be never permitting\njuvenile offenders to be tried as adults. Learning that an\n10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nAmendment that bars only “unusual” punishments re-\nquires the abolition of this uniformly established practice\nwould be startling indeed.\n                        *     *    *\n  It is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder—\nmost of all for the innocent victims. But also for the mur-\nderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early. And for\nsociety as well, which has lost one or more of its members\nto deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another.\nIn recent years, our society has moved toward requiring\nthat the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned\nfor the remainder of his life. Members of this Court may\ndisagree with that choice. Perhaps science and policy\nsuggest society should show greater mercy to young kill-\ners, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at\nthe risk that they will kill again. See ante, at 8–11. But\nthat is not our decision to make. Neither the text of the\nConstitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from\nrequiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life\nwithout parole.

To reach\nthat result, the Court relies on two lines of precedent. The\nfirst involves the categorical prohibition of certain pun-\nishments for specified classes of offenders. The second\nrequires individualized sentencing in the capital punish-\nment context. Neither line is consistent with the original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause. The Court compounds its errors by combining\nthese lines of precedent and extending them to reach a result\nthat is even less legitimate than the foundation on which\nit is built.

Of these categorical propor-\ntionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). In Roper, the Court held\nthat the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender\nwho was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S.,\nat 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its\nown sense of parental intuition and “scientific and socio-\nlogical studies” to conclude that offenders under the age of\n18 “cannot with reliability be classified among the worst\noffenders.” Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on\nsimilar considerations to conclude that the Constitution\nprohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide\noffender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his\noffense. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).\n   The Court now concludes that mandatory life-without-\nparole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers\n“contraven[e] Graham’s (and also Roper’s) foundational\nprinciple: that imposition of a State’s most severe penal-\nties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they\nwere not children.” Ante, at 11–12. But neither Roper nor\nGraham held that specific procedural rules are required\nfor sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic\nof those cases should not be extended to create such a\nrequirement.\n   The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: “Excessive\n——————\n  1 I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion because it accurately explains\n\nthat, even accepting the Court’s precedents, the Court’s holding in\ntoday’s cases is unsupportable.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Cali-\nfornia, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.\n957, 975–985 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). In short, it\ndoes not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment\nthey deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime\nor to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the clause\n“leaves the unavoidably moral question of who ‘deserves’ a\nparticular nonprohibited method of punishment to the\njudgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.”\nGraham, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n   The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of\n27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 19–20, have determined\n——————\n  2 Neither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners’ sentences\n\nwould have been among “the ‘modes or acts of punishment that had\nbeen considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights\nwas adopted.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 10, n. 3) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)).\nNor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they commit-\nted their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds\nwere subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nFurther, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994–995 (1991). It is therefore\nimplausible that a 14-year-old’s mandatory prison sentence—of any\nlength, with or without parole—would have been viewed as cruel and\nunusual.\n4                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses,\nwhether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in\nprison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our\nConstitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.\n                             II\n   To invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences\nfor juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases “prohib-\nit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.”\nAnte, at 7. The Court reasons that, because Graham\ncompared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the\ndeath penalty, the “distinctive set of legal rules” that this\nCourt has imposed in the capital punishment context,\nincluding the requirement of individualized sentencing, is\n“relevant” here. Ante, at 12–13. But even accepting an\nanalogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole\nsentences, this Court’s cases prohibiting mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing schemes have no basis in the original un-\nderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot\njustify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles.\n                               A\n   In a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.\n238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the manda-\ntory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v.\nNorth Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion);\nRoberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner\nv. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced\nthe principle that States may not permit sentencers to\nexercise unguided discretion in imposing the death pen-\nalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman,\nmany States passed new laws that made the death pen-\nalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes,\nthereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg\nv. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 180–181 (1976) (joint opinion\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nof Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The Court invali-\ndated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner.\nThe Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing\nschemes were problematic, because they failed “to allow\nthe particularized consideration” of “relevant facets of the\ncharacter and record of the individual offender or the\ncircumstances of the particular offense.” Woodson, supra,\nat 303–304 (plurality opinion).3\n   In my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly\ndecided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits\n“torturous methods of punishment.” See Graham, 560\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with\nwhether a particular lawful method of punishment—\nwhether capital or noncapital—is imposed pursuant to a\nmandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gard-\nner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting) (“The prohibition of the Eighth Amendment\nrelates to the character of the punishment, and not to the\nprocess by which it is imposed”). In fact, “[i]n the early\ndays of the Republic,” each crime generally had a defined\npunishment “prescribed with specificity by the legisla-\nture.” United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978).\nCapital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were\n——————\n  3 The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defend-\n\nants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permit-\nted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of\nthe defendant. See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597–608 (1978)\n(plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112\n(1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1986); Johnson v.\nTexas, 509 U. S. 350, 361–368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the\nrequirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating\nevidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital\nsentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital\nsentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488–500 (1993)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).\n6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntreated no differently. “[M]andatory death sentences\nabounded in our first Penal Code” and were “common in\nthe several States—both at the time of the founding and\nthroughout the 19th century.” Harmelin, 501 U. S., at\n994–995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opin-\nion) (“At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted\nin 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law\npractice of making death the exclusive and mandatory\nsentence for certain specified offenses”). Accordingly, the\nidea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwise-\nconstitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and\nunusual finds “no support in the text and history of the\nEighth Amendment.” Harmelin, supra, at 994.\n   Moreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were “a\nperfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns\nexpressed in Furman” regarding unguided sentencing\ndiscretion, in that they “eliminat[ed] explicit jury discre-\ntion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.” Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years\nago, “a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide\nthat the commission of certain crimes conclusively estab-\nlishes that a criminal’s character is such that he deserves\ndeath.” Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus,\nthere is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the\nCourt’s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the\ncapital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a\nvalid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court\nannounces today.\n                             B\n   In any event, this Court has already declined to extend\nits individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death pen-\nalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npossessing a large quantity of drugs. 501 U. S., at 961\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In accordance with Michigan\nlaw, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole. Ibid. Citing the same\nline of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies\ntoday, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its\nmandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause. Id., at 994–995 (opinion of the Court).\n   The Court rejected that argument, explaining that\n“[t]here can be no serious contention . . . that a sentence\nwhich is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so sim-\nply because it is ‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. In so doing,\nthe Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.\nThe Court noted that those cases had “repeatedly suggested\nthat there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing]\nrequirement outside the capital context, because of the\nqualitative difference between death and all other penal-\nties.” Ibid. The Court observed that, “even where the\ndifference” between a sentence of life without parole and\nother sentences of imprisonment “is the greatest,” such\na sentence “cannot be compared with death.” Id., at 996.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases re-\nquiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at cap-\nital cases, and that there was “no basis for extending it\nfurther.” Ibid.\n   Harmelin’s reasoning logically extends to these cases.\nObviously, the younger the defendant, “the great[er]” the\ndifference between a sentence of life without parole and\nother terms of imprisonment. Ibid. But under Harmelin’s\nrationale, the defendant’s age is immaterial to the Eighth\nAmendment analysis. Thus, the result in today’s cases\nshould be the same as that in Harmelin. Petitioners, like\nthe defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death.\nAccordingly, this Court’s cases “creating and clarifying the\nindividualized capital sentencing doctrine” do not apply.\nId., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n8                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Nothing about our Constitution, or about the qualitative\ndifference between any term of imprisonment and death,\nhas changed since Harmelin was decided 21 years ago.\nWhat has changed (or, better yet, “evolved”) is this Court’s\never-expanding line of categorical proportionality cases.\nThe Court now uses Roper and Graham to jettison Har-\nmelin’s clear distinction between capital and noncapital\ncases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile of-\nfenders.4 The Court’s decision to do so is even less sup-\nportable than the precedents used to reach it.\n                             III\n   As THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes, ante, at 8–9 (dissenting\nopinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future incur-\nsions on the States’ authority to sentence criminals. In its\ncategorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered\n“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed\nin legislative enactments and state practice’ to determine\nwhether there is a national consensus against the sentenc-\ning practice at issue.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). In Graham, for\nexample, the Court looked to “[a]ctual sentencing prac-\ntices” to conclude that there was a national consensus\nagainst life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhom-\nicide offenders. 560 U.

Nothing in\nthe Constitution supports this arrogation of legislative\nauthority.\n  The Court long ago abandoned the original meaning of\nthe Eighth Amendment, holding instead that the prohi-\nbition of “cruel and unusual punishment” embodies the\n“evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.” Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958)\n2                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n(plurality opinion); see also Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 7); Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554\nU. S. 407, 419 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551,\n560–561 (2005); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 311–312\n(2002); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8 (1992); Ford v.\nWainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 406 (1986); Rhodes v. Chap-\nman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981); Estelle v. Gamble, 429\nU. S. 97, 102 (1976). Both the provenance and philosoph-\nical basis for this standard were problematic from the\nstart. (Is it true that our society is inexorably evolving in\nthe direction of greater and greater decency? Who says\nso, and how did this particular philosophy of history find\nits way into our fundamental law? And in any event,\naren’t elected representatives more likely than unaccount­\nable judges to reflect changing societal standards?) But at\nleast at the start, the Court insisted that these “evolving\nstandards” represented something other than the personal\nviews of five Justices. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S.\n263, 275 (1980) (explaining that “the Court’s Eighth\nAmendment judgments should neither be nor appear to\nbe merely the subjective views of individual Justices”). In­\nstead, the Court looked for objective indicia of our society’s\nmoral standards and the trajectory of our moral “evolu­\ntion.” See id., at 274–275 (emphasizing that “ ‘judgment\nshould be informed by objective factors to the maximum\npossible extent’ ” (quoting Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,\n592 (1977) (plurality opinion))).\n   In this search for objective indicia, the Court toyed with\nthe use of public opinion polls, see Atkins, supra, at 316,\nn. 21, and occasionally relied on foreign law, see Roper v.\nSimmons, supra, at 575; Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S.\n782, 796, n. 22 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S.\n815, 830–831 (1988); Coker, 433 U. S., at 596, n. 10 (plu­\nrality opinion).\n   In the main, however, the staple of this inquiry was the\ntallying of the positions taken by state legislatures. Thus,\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nin Coker, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohib­\nits the imposition of the death penalty for the rape of an\nadult woman, the Court noted that only one State permit­\nted that practice. Id., at 595–596. In Enmund, where the\nCourt held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital\npunishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law\nand the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the\ndeath penalty at the time rejected that punishment. 458\nU. S., at 789.\n   While the tally in these early cases may be character­\nized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence\nbecame weaker and weaker in later cases. In Atkins,\nwhich held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced\nto death, the Court found an anti–death-penalty consen­\nsus even though more than half of the States that allowed\ncapital punishment permitted the practice. See 536 U. S.,\nat 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (observing that less than\nhalf of the 38 States that permit capital punishment\nhave enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally\nretarded). The Court attempted to get around this prob­\nlem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against\nthis punishment. See id., at 313–315 (listing 18 States\nthat had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the\nexecution of mentally retarded persons).\n   The importance of trend evidence, however, was not\nlong lived. In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment\nfor defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of\nthe States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in\nfavor of abolition—five States during the past 15 years—\nwas less impressive. Roper, 543 U. S., at 564–565. Never­\ntheless, the Court held that the absence of a strong trend\nin support of abolition did not matter. See id., at 566\n(“Any difference between this case and Atkins with respect\nto the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the\nconsistent direction of the change”).\n   In Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court went further. Hold­\n4                     MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ning that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punish­\nment for the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl, the Court\ndisregarded a nascent legislative trend in favor of permit-\nting capital punishment for this narrowly defined and\nheinous crime. See 554 U. S., at 433 (explaining that,\nalthough “the total number of States to have made child\nrape a capital offense . . . is six,” “[t]his is not an indication\nof a trend or change in direction comparable to the one\nsupported by data in Roper”). The Court felt no need to\nsee whether this trend developed further—perhaps be­\ncause true moral evolution can lead in only one direction.\nAnd despite the argument that the rape of a young child\nmay involve greater depravity than some murders, the\nCourt proclaimed that homicide is categorically different\nfrom all (or maybe almost all) other offenses. See id.,\nat 438 (stating that nonhomicide crimes, including child\nrape, “may be devastating in their harm . . . but in terms\nof moral depravity and of the injury to the person and\nto the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their\nseverity and irrevocability” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)). As the Court had previously put\nit, “death is different.” Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Two years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any\npretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded.\nIn Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the\nDistrict of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to\nlife imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes,\nbut despite this unmistakable evidence of a national con­\nsensus, the Court held that the practice violates the\nEighth Amendment. See 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 1–3). The Court, however, drew a\ndistinction between minors who murder and minors who\ncommit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense\nthe principle that death is different lived on.\n   Today, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   5\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nare concerned with the imposition of a term of imprison­\nment on offenders who kill. The two (carefully selected)\ncases before us concern very young defendants, and de­\nspite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at\nleast one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy\nfor a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of\nrelease. But no one should be confused by the particulars\nof the two cases before us. The category of murderers that\nthe Court delicately calls “children” (murderers under the\nage of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are\nfast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller\nand Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical\nare murderers like Christopher Simmons, who committed\na brutal thrill-killing just seven months shy of his 18th\nbirthday. Roper, 543 U. S., at 556.\n   Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of\nmurders every year,1 and some of these crimes are incred­\nibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as ma­\nture as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, 487 U. S.,\nat 854 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that\nmaturity may “vary widely among different individuals of\nthe same age”). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States\nhave concluded that at least some of these murderers\nshould be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28\nStates and the Federal Government have decided that for\nsome of these offenders life without parole should be man­\ndatory. See Ante, at 20–21, and nn. 9–10. The majority of\nthis Court now overrules these legislative judgments.2\n——————\n  1 Between  2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average com­\nbined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, §4, Arrests, Age of per­\nsons arrested (Table 4.7).\n  2 As the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366\n\n(1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate\ndiscretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these\npractices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill\n6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  It is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently\npermits a trial judge to make an individualized decision\nthat a particular minor convicted of murder should be\nsentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this\npossibility to last very long. The majority goes out of its\nway to express the view that the imposition of a sentence\nof life without parole on a “child” (i.e., a murderer under\nthe age of 18) should be uncommon. Having held in Gra-\nham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing\nauthority may not impose a sentence of life without parole\non a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the\nJustices in the majority may soon extend that holding to\nminors who commit murder. We will see.\n  What today’s decision shows is that our Eighth Amend­\nment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of\nsociety’s standards. Our Eighth Amendment case law is\nnow entirely inward looking. After entirely disregarding\nobjective indicia of our society’s standards in Graham, the\nCourt now extrapolates from Graham. Future cases may\nextrapolate from today’s holding, and this process may\ncontinue until the majority brings sentencing practices\ninto line with whatever the majority views as truly\nevolved standards of decency.\n  The Eighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the\n——————\nrejected what it called the “outmoded rehabilitation model” for federal\ncriminal sentencing. S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 38 (1983). According to\nthe Report, “almost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now\ndoubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting,\nand it is now quite certain that no one can really detect whether or\nwhen a prisoner is rehabilitated.” Ibid. The Report also “observed that\nthe indeterminate-sentencing system had two ‘unjustifi[ed] and ‘shame­\nful’ consequences. The first was the great variation among sentences\nimposed by different judges upon similarly situated offenders. The\nsecond was uncertainty as to the time the offender would spend in\nprison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective\noperation of the criminal justice system.” Mistretta, supra, at 366\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 38, 65 (citation omitted)).\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsentences that may be imposed in criminal cases, but for\nthe most part it leaves questions of sentencing policy to be\ndetermined by Congress and the state legislatures—and\nwith good reason. Determining the length of imprison­\nment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a\nparticular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in­\nterests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes\nthe criminal from the general population and prevents\nhim from committing additional crimes in the outside\nworld. When a legislature prescribes that a category of\nkillers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legisla­\nture, which presumably reflects the views of the elec­\ntorate, is taking the position that the risk that these\noffenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing\nconsideration, including reduced culpability due to imma­\nturity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the major­\nity of this Court countermands that democratic decision,\nwhat the majority is saying is that members of society\nmust be exposed to the risk that these convicted murder­\ners, if released from custody, will murder again.\n   Unless our cases change course, we will continue to\nmarch toward some vision of evolutionary culmination\nthat the Court has not yet disclosed. The Constitution\ndoes not authorize us to take the country on this journey.\n</pre>", "id": 803271, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/06/25/miller_v._alabama_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2011                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

In No. 10−9647, petitioner Jackson accompanied two\n  other boys to a video store to commit a robbery; on the way to the\n  store, he learned that one of the boys was carrying a shotgun. Jack-\n  son stayed outside the store for most of the robbery, but after he en-\n  tered, one of his co-conspirators shot and killed the store clerk.

The\n  trial court imposed a statutorily mandated sentence of life imprison-\n  ment without the possibility of parole.

Pp. 6−27.\n    (a) The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual pun-\n ishment “guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to ex-\n cessive sanctions.” Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551, 560. That right\n “flows from the basic ‘precept of justice that punishment for crime\n should be graduated and proportioned’ ” to both the offender and the\n offense. Ibid.\n    Two strands of precedent reflecting the concern with proportionate\n punishment come together here. The first has adopted categorical\n bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the cul-\n pability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See, e.g.,\n Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407. Several cases in this group\n have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser\n culpability. Thus, Roper v. Simmons held that the Eighth Amend-\n ment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham v. Florida,\n 560 U. S. ___, concluded that the Amendment prohibits a sentence of\n life without the possibility of parole for a juvenile convicted of a non-\n homicide offense. Graham further likened life without parole for ju-\n veniles to the death penalty, thereby evoking a second line of cases.\n In those decisions, this Court has required sentencing authorities to\n consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his of-\n fense before sentencing him to death. See, e.g., Woodson v. North\n Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (plurality opinion). Here, the confluence of\n these two lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\n life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.\n    As to the first set of cases: Roper and Graham establish that chil-\n dren are constitutionally different from adults for sentencing purpos-\n es. Their “ ‘lack of maturity’ ” and “ ‘underdeveloped sense of respon-\n sibility’ ” lead to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.\n Roper, 543 U. S., at 569. They “are more vulnerable . . . to negative\n influences and outside pressures,” including from their family and\n peers; they have limited “contro[l] over their own environment” and\n lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\n settings. Ibid. And because a child’s character is not as “well\n formed” as an adult’s, his traits are “less fixed” and his actions are\n less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e] deprav[ity].” Id., at 570.\n Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive attributes of\n youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing the harsh-\n est sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they commit terrible\n crimes.\n    While Graham’s flat ban on life without parole was for nonhomi-\n                   Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncide crimes, nothing that Graham said about children is crime-\nspecific. Thus, its reasoning implicates any life-without-parole sen-\ntence for a juvenile, even as its categorical bar relates only to non-\nhomicide offenses. Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth\nmatters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarcera-\ntion without the possibility of parole. The mandatory penalty\nschemes at issue here, however, prevent the sentencer from consider-\ning youth and from assessing whether the law’s harshest term of im-\nprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender. This con-\ntravenes Graham’s (and also Roper’s) foundational principle: that\nimposition of a State’s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders\ncannot proceed as though they were not children.\n   Graham also likened life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty. That decision recognized that life-without-parole\nsentences “share some characteristics with death sentences that are\nshared by no other sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___. And it treated life\nwithout parole for juveniles like this Court’s cases treat the death\npenalty, imposing a categorical bar on its imposition for nonhomicide\noffenses. By likening life-without-parole sentences for juveniles to\nthe death penalty, Graham makes relevant this Court’s cases de-\nmanding individualized sentencing in capital cases. In particular,\nthose cases have emphasized that sentencers must be able to consid-\ner the mitigating qualities of youth. In light of Graham’s reasoning,\nthese decisions also show the flaws of imposing mandatory life-\nwithout-parole sentences on juvenile homicide offenders. Pp. 6−17.\n   (b) The counterarguments of Alabama and Arkansas are unpersua-\nsive. Pp. 18–27.\n        (1) The States first contend that Harmelin v. Michigan, 501\nU. S. 957, forecloses a holding that mandatory life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. Harmelin de-\nclined to extend the individualized sentencing requirement to non-\ncapital cases “because of the qualitative difference between death and\nall other penalties.” Id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). But Harmelin had nothing to do with chil-\ndren, and did not purport to apply to juvenile offenders. Indeed,\nsince Harmelin, this Court has held on multiple occasions that sen-\ntencing practices that are permissible for adults may not be so for\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Graham, 560 U. S ___.\n   The States next contend that mandatory life-without-parole terms\nfor juveniles cannot be unconstitutional because 29 jurisdictions im-\npose them on at least some children convicted of murder. In consid-\nering categorical bars to the death penalty and life without parole,\nthis Court asks as part of the analysis whether legislative enact-\nments and actual sentencing practices show a national consensus\n4                          MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against a sentence for a particular class of offenders. But where, as\n    here, this Court does not categorically bar a penalty, but instead re-\n    quires only that a sentencer follow a certain process, this Court has\n    not scrutinized or relied on legislative enactments in the same way.\n    See, e.g., Sumner v. Schuman, 483 U. S. 66.\n       In any event, the “objective indicia of society’s standards,” Graham,\n    560 U. S., at ___, that the States offer do not distinguish these cases\n    from others holding that a sentencing practice violates the Eighth\n    Amendment. Fewer States impose mandatory life-without-parole\n    sentences on juvenile homicide offenders than authorized the penalty\n    (life-without-parole for nonhomicide offenders) that this Court invali-\n    dated in Graham. And as Graham and Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487\n    U. S. 815, explain, simply counting legislative enactments can pre-\n    sent a distorted view. In those cases, as here, the relevant penalty\n    applied to juveniles based on two separate provisions: One allowed\n    the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to adult court, while another\n    set out penalties for any and all individuals tried there. In those cir-\n    cumstances, this Court reasoned, it was impossible to say whether a\n    legislature had endorsed a given penalty for children (or would do so\n    if presented with the choice). The same is true here. Pp. 18–25.\n           (2) The States next argue that courts and prosecutors suffi-\n    ciently consider a juvenile defendant’s age, as well as his background\n    and the circumstances of his crime, when deciding whether to try him\n    as an adult. But this argument ignores that many States use manda-\n    tory transfer systems. In addition, some lodge the decision in the\n    hands of the prosecutors, rather than courts. And even where judges\n    have transfer-stage discretion, it has limited utility, because the deci-\n    sionmaker typically will have only partial information about the child\n    or the circumstances of his offense. Finally, because of the limited\n    sentencing options in some juvenile courts, the transfer decision may\n    present a choice between a light sentence as a juvenile and standard\n    sentencing as an adult. It cannot substitute for discretion at post-\n    trial sentencing. Pp. 25−27.\nNo. 10−9646, 63 So. 3d 676, and No. 10−9647, 2011 Ark. 49, ___ S.

In neither case did the sentenc-\ning authority have any discretion to impose a different\npunishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die\nin prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that\nhis youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the\nnature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example,\nlife with the possibility of parole) more appropriate. Such\na scheme prevents those meting out punishment from\nconsidering a juvenile’s “lessened culpability” and greater\n“capacity for change,” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,\n2                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 17, 23), and runs afoul of our cases’\nrequirement of individualized sentencing for defendants\nfacing the most serious penalties. We therefore hold that\nmandatory life without parole for those under the age of\n18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amend-\nment’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments.”\n                               I\n                              A\n  In November 1999, petitioner Kuntrell Jackson, then 14\nyears old, and two other boys decided to rob a video store.\nEn route to the store, Jackson learned that one of the\nboys, Derrick Shields, was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in\nhis coat sleeve. Jackson decided to stay outside when the\ntwo other boys entered the store. Inside, Shields pointed\nthe gun at the store clerk, Laurie Troup, and demanded\nthat she “give up the money.” Jackson v. State, 359 Ark.\n87, 89, 194 S. W. 3d 757, 759 (2004) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Troup refused. A few moments later,\nJackson went into the store to find Shields continuing to\ndemand money. At trial, the parties disputed whether\nJackson warned Troup that “[w]e ain’t playin’,” or instead\ntold his friends, “I thought you all was playin’.” Id., at 91,\n194 S. W. 3d, at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhen Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and\nkilled her. The three boys fled empty-handed. See id., at\n89–92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 758–760.\n  Arkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14-\nyear-olds as adults when they are alleged to have commit-\nted certain serious offenses. See Ark. Code Ann. §9–27–\n318(c)(2) (1998). The prosecutor here exercised that au-\nthority by charging Jackson with capital felony murder\nand aggravated robbery. Jackson moved to transfer the\ncase to juvenile court, but after considering the alleged\nfacts of the crime, a psychiatrist’s examination, and Jack-\nson’s juvenile arrest history (shoplifting and several inci-\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

State, No.\n02–535, 2003 WL 193412, *1 (Ark. App., Jan. 29, 2003);\n§§9–27–318(d), (e). A jury later convicted Jackson of both\ncrimes. Noting that “in view of [the] verdict, there’s only\none possible punishment,” the judge sentenced Jackson to\nlife without parole. App. in No. 10–9647, p. 55 (hereinaf-\nter Jackson App.); see Ark. Code Ann. §5–4–104(b) (1997)\n(“A defendant convicted of capital murder or treason shall\nbe sentenced to death or life imprisonment without pa-\nrole”).1 Jackson did not challenge the sentence on appeal,\nand the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the convic-\ntions. See 359 Ark. 87, 194 S. W. 3d 757.\n   Following Roper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), in\nwhich this Court invalidated the death penalty for all\njuvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a\nstate petition for habeas corpus. He argued, based on\nRoper’s reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life with-\nout parole for a 14-year-old also violates the Eighth\nAmendment. The circuit court rejected that argument and\ngranted the State’s motion to dismiss. See Jackson App.\n72–76. While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held\nin Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the\nEighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomi-\ncide offenders. After the parties filed briefs addressing\nthat decision, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the\ndismissal of Jackson’s petition. See Jackson v. Norris,\n2011 Ark. 49, ___ S. W. 3d ___. The majority found that\nRoper and Graham were “narrowly tailored” to their con-\ntexts: “death-penalty cases involving a juvenile and life-\nimprisonment-without-parole cases for nonhomicide of-\n\n——————\n  1 Jackson was ineligible for the death penalty under Thompson v.\nOklahoma, 487 U.

They noted that Jackson was not\nthe shooter and that “any evidence of intent to kill was\nseverely lacking.”     Id., at 10, ___ S. W. 3d, at ___\n(Danielson, J., dissenting). And they argued that Jack-\nson’s mandatory sentence ran afoul of Graham’s admoni-\ntion that “ ‘[a]n offender’s age is relevant to the Eighth\nAmendment, and criminal procedure laws that fail to take\ndefendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be\nflawed.’ ” Id., at 10–11, ___ S. W. 3d, at ___ (quoting Gra-\nham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25)).2\n                             B\n   Like Jackson, petitioner Evan Miller was 14 years old at\nthe time of his crime. Miller had by then been in and out\nof foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism\nand drug addiction and his stepfather abused him. Miller,\ntoo, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had at-\ntempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years\nold. See E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d 1077, 1081 (Ala.\nCrim. App. 2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result); App. in\nNo. 10–9646, pp. 26–28 (hereinafter Miller App.).\n   One night in 2003, Miller was at home with a friend,\nColby Smith, when a neighbor, Cole Cannon, came to\nmake a drug deal with Miller’s mother. See 6 Record in\nNo. 10–9646, p. 1004. The two boys followed Cannon back\nto his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and\n——————\n  2 For the first time in this Court, Arkansas contends that Jackson’s\n\nsentence was not mandatory. On its view, state law then in effect\nallowed the trial judge to suspend the life-without-parole sentence and\ncommit Jackson to the Department of Human Services for a “training-\nschool program,” at the end of which he could be placed on probation.\nBrief for Respondent in No. 10–9647, pp. 36–37 (hereinafter Arkansas\nBrief) (citing Ark. Code Ann. §12–28–403(b)(2) (1999)). But Arkansas\nnever raised that objection in the state courts, and they treated Jack-\nson’s sentence as mandatory. We abide by that interpretation of state\nlaw. See, e.g., Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 690–691 (1975).\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nplayed drinking games. When Cannon passed out, Miller\nstole his wallet, splitting about $300 with Smith. Miller\nthen tried to put the wallet back in Cannon’s pocket, but\nCannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat. Smith\nhit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released,\nMiller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with\nit. Miller placed a sheet over Cannon’s head, told him\n“ ‘I am God, I’ve come to take your life,’ ” and delivered one\nmore blow. Miller v. State, 63 So. 3d 676, 689 (Ala. Crim.\nApp. 2010). The boys then retreated to Miller’s trailer, but\nsoon decided to return to Cannon’s to cover up evidence of\ntheir crime. Once there, they lit two fires. Cannon even-\ntually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation. See\nid., at 683–685, 689.\n    Alabama law required that Miller initially be charged as\na juvenile, but allowed the District Attorney to seek re-\nmoval of the case to adult court. See Ala. Code §12–15–34\n(1977). The D. A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed\nto the transfer after a hearing. Citing the nature of the\ncrime, Miller’s “mental maturity,” and his prior juvenile\noffenses (truancy and “criminal mischief”), the Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals affirmed. E. J. M. v. State, No.\nCR–03–0915, pp. 5–7 (Aug. 27, 2004) (unpublished memo-\nrandum).3 The State accordingly charged Miller as an\nadult with murder in the course of arson. That crime (like\ncapital murder in Arkansas) carries a mandatory mini-\n——————\n  3 The  Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed the juvenile court’s\ndenial of Miller’s request for funds to hire his own mental expert for the\ntransfer hearing. The court pointed out that under governing Alabama\nSupreme Court precedent, “the procedural requirements of a trial do\nnot ordinarily apply” to those hearings. E. J. M. v. State, 928 So. 2d\n1077 (2004) (Cobb, J., concurring in result) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In a separate opinion, Judge Cobb agreed on the reigning\nprecedent, but urged the State Supreme Court to revisit the question in\nlight of transfer hearings’ importance. See id., at 1081 (“[A]lthough\nlater mental evaluation as an adult affords some semblance of proce-\ndural due process, it is, in effect, too little, too late”).\n6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmum punishment of life without parole. See Ala. Code\n§§13A–5–40(9), 13A–6–2(c) (1982).\n  Relying in significant part on testimony from Smith,\nwho had pleaded to a lesser offense, a jury found Miller\nguilty. He was therefore sentenced to life without the\npossibility of parole. The Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals affirmed, ruling that life without parole was “not\noverly harsh when compared to the crime” and that the\nmandatory nature of the sentencing scheme was permissi-\nble under the Eighth Amendment. 63 So. 3d, at 690; see\nid., at 686–691. The Alabama Supreme Court denied\nreview.\n  We granted certiorari in both cases, see 565 U. S. ___\n(2011) (No. 10–9646); 565 U. S. ___ (2011) (No. 10–9647),\nand now reverse.\n                             II\n   The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and un-\nusual punishment “guarantees individuals the right not to\nbe subjected to excessive sanctions.” Roper, 543 U. S., at\n560. That right, we have explained, “flows from the basic\n‘precept of justice that punishment for crime should be\ngraduated and proportioned’ ” to both the offender and the\noffense. Ibid. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U. S.\n349, 367 (1910)). As we noted the last time we consid-\nered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles,\n“[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth\nAmendment.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nAnd we view that concept less through a historical prism\nthan according to “ ‘the evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.’ ” Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles,\n356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).\n   The cases before us implicate two strands of precedent\nreflecting our concern with proportionate punishment.\nThe first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npractices based on mismatches between the culpability of\na class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. See\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9–10) (listing cases).\nSo, for example, we have held that imposing the death\npenalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or\nimposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the\nEighth Amendment. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S.\n407 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S. 304 (2002). Sev-\neral of the cases in this group have specially focused on\njuvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability.\nThus, Roper held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital\npunishment for children, and Graham concluded that the\nAmendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the\npossibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomi-\ncide offense. Graham further likened life without parole\nfor juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking\na second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have\nprohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment,\nrequiring that sentencing authorities consider the charac-\nteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before\nsentencing him to death. See Woodson v. North Carolina,\n428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio,\n438 U. S. 586 (1978). Here, the confluence of these two\nlines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles violate the\nEighth Amendment.4\n——————\n  4 The  three dissenting opinions here each take issue with some or all\nof those precedents. See post, at 5–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 1–6 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); post, at 1–4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). That\nis not surprising: their authors (and joiner) each dissented from some or\nall of those precedents. See, e.g., Kennedy, 554 U. S., at 447 (ALITO, J.,\njoined by ROBERTS, C. J., and SCALIA and THOMAS, JJ., dissenting);\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 607 (SCALIA, J., joined by THOMAS, J., dissenting);\nAtkins, 536 U.

S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (contending\nthat Woodson was wrongly decided). In particular, each disagreed with\n8                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  To start with the first set of cases: Roper and Graham\nestablish that children are constitutionally different from\nadults for purposes of sentencing. Because juveniles have\ndiminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\nwe explained, “they are less deserving of the most severe\npunishments.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).\nThose cases relied on three significant gaps between juve-\nniles and adults. First, children have a “ ‘lack of maturity\nand an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,’ ” leading to\nrecklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Roper,\n543 U. S., at 569. Second, children “are more vulner-\nable . . . to negative influences and outside pressures,”\nincluding from their family and peers; they have limited\n“contro[l] over their own environment” and lack the ability\nto extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing\nsettings. Ibid. And third, a child’s character is not as\n“well formed” as an adult’s; his traits are “less fixed” and\nhis actions less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e]\ndeprav[ity].” Id., at 570.\n  Our decisions rested not only on common sense—on\nwhat “any parent knows”—but on science and social sci-\nence as well. Id., at 569. In Roper, we cited studies\nshowing that “‘[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adoles-\ncents’ ” who engage in illegal activity “ ‘develop entrenched\npatterns of problem behavior.’ ” Id., at 570 (quoting Stein-\nberg & Scott, Less Guilty by Reason of Adolescence: De-\nvelopmental Immaturity, Diminished Responsibility, and\nthe Juvenile Death Penalty, 58 Am. Psychologist 1009,\n——————\nthe majority’s reasoning in Graham, which is the foundation stone of\nour analysis. See Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C.

While the dissents seek to relitigate old\nEighth Amendment battles, repeating many arguments this Court has\npreviously (and often) rejected, we apply the logic of Roper, Graham,\nand our individualized sentencing decisions to these two cases.\n                    Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1014 (2003)). And in Graham, we noted that “develop-\nments in psychology and brain science continue to show\nfundamental differences between juvenile and adult\nminds”—for example, in “parts of the brain involved in\nbehavior control.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).5 We\nreasoned that those findings—of transient rashness, pro-\nclivity for risk, and inability to assess consequences—both\nlessened a child’s “moral culpability” and enhanced the\nprospect that, as the years go by and neurological devel-\nopment occurs, his “ ‘deficiencies will be reformed.’ ” Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 570).\n   Roper and Graham emphasized that the distinctive at-\ntributes of youth diminish the penological justifications\nfor imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders,\neven when they commit terrible crimes. Because “ ‘[t]he\nheart of the retribution rationale’ ” relates to an offender’s\nblameworthiness, “ ‘the case for retribution is not as strong\nwith a minor as with an adult.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 20–21) (quoting Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.\n137, 149 (1987); Roper, 543 U. S., at 571). Nor can deter-\nrence do the work in this context, because “ ‘the same\ncharacteristics that render juveniles less culpable than\nadults’ ”—their immaturity, recklessness, and impetuos-\nity—make them less likely to consider potential punish-\n——————\n  5 The evidence presented to us in these cases indicates that the sci-\n\nence and social science supporting Roper’s and Graham’s conclusions\nhave become even stronger. See, e.g., Brief for American Psychologi-\ncal Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3 (“[A]n ever-growing body of\nresearch in developmental psychology and neuroscience continues to\nconfirm and strengthen the Court’s conclusions”); id., at 4 (“It is in-\ncreasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in\nregions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as\nimpulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance”); Brief for J.\nLawrence Aber et al. as Amici Curiae 12–28 (discussing post-Graham\nstudies); id., at 26–27 (“Numerous studies post-Graham indicate that\nexposure to deviant peers leads to increased deviant behavior and is a\nconsistent predictor of adolescent delinquency” (footnote omitted)).\n10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting\nRoper, 543 U. S., at 571). Similarly, incapacitation could\nnot support the life-without-parole sentence in Graham:\nDeciding that a “juvenile offender forever will be a danger\nto society” would require “mak[ing] a judgment that [he]\nis incorrigible”—but “ ‘incorrigibility is inconsistent with\nyouth.’ ” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (quoting Work-\nman v. Commonwealth, 429 S. W. 2d 374, 378 (Ky. App.\n1968)). And for the same reason, rehabilitation could not\njustify that sentence. Life without parole “forswears\naltogether the rehabilitative ideal.” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 23). It reflects “an irrevocable judgment\nabout [an offender’s] value and place in society,” at odds\nwith a child’s capacity for change. Ibid.\n  Graham concluded from this analysis that life-without-\nparole sentences, like capital punishment, may violate\nthe Eighth Amendment when imposed on children. To be\nsure, Graham’s flat ban on life without parole applied only\nto nonhomicide crimes, and the Court took care to distin-\nguish those offenses from murder, based on both moral\nculpability and consequential harm. See id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18). But none of what it said about children—about\ntheir distinctive (and transitory) mental traits and en-\nvironmental vulnerabilities—is crime-specific.         Those\nfeatures are evident in the same way, and to the same de-\ngree, when (as in both cases here) a botched robbery turns\ninto a killing. So Graham’s reasoning implicates any life-\nwithout-parole sentence imposed on a juvenile, even as its\ncategorical bar relates only to nonhomicide offenses.\n  Most fundamentally, Graham insists that youth matters\nin determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incar-\nceration without the possibility of parole. In the circum-\nstances there, juvenile status precluded a life-without-\nparole sentence, even though an adult could receive it for a\nsimilar crime. And in other contexts as well, the charac-\nteristics of youth, and the way they weaken rationales for\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npunishment, can render a life-without-parole sentence\ndisproportionate. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 20–23) (gener-\nally doubting the penological justifications for imposing\nlife without parole on juveniles). “An offender’s age,” we\nmade clear in Graham, “is relevant to the Eighth Amend-\nment,” and so “criminal procedure laws that fail to take\ndefendants’ youthfulness into account at all would be\nflawed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 25). THE CHIEF JUSTICE,\nconcurring in the judgment, made a similar point. Al-\nthough rejecting a categorical bar on life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles, he acknowledged “Roper’s conclu-\nsion that juveniles are typically less culpable than adults,”\nand accordingly wrote that “an offender’s juvenile status\ncan play a central role” in considering a sentence’s propor-\ntionality. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5–6); see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 12) (Graham’s “youth is one factor, among others,\nthat should be considered in deciding whether his pun-\nishment was unconstitutionally excessive”).6\n   But the mandatory penalty schemes at issue here pre-\nvent the sentencer from taking account of these central\nconsiderations. By removing youth from the balance—\nby subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole\nsentence applicable to an adult—these laws prohibit a\nsentencing authority from assessing whether the law’s\nharshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a\njuvenile offender. That contravenes Graham’s (and also\nRoper’s) foundational principle: that imposition of a State’s\n——————\n   6 In discussing Graham, the dissents essentially ignore all of this\n\nreasoning. See post, at 3–6 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 4\n(opinion of ALITO, J.). Indeed, THE CHIEF JUSTICE ignores the points\nmade in his own concurring opinion. The only part of Graham that the\ndissents see fit to note is the distinction it drew between homicide and\nnonhomicide offenses. See post, at 7–8 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post,\nat 4 (opinion of ALITO, J.). But contrary to the dissents’ charge, our\ndecision today retains that distinction: Graham established one rule (a\nflat ban) for nonhomicide offenses, while we set out a different one\n(individualized sentencing) for homicide offenses.\n12                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmost severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed\nas though they were not children.\n   And Graham makes plain these mandatory schemes’\ndefects in another way: by likening life-without-parole\nsentences imposed on juveniles to the death penalty itself.\nLife-without-parole terms, the Court wrote, “share some\ncharacteristics with death sentences that are shared by no\nother sentences.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 19). Im-\nprisoning an offender until he dies alters the remainder of\nhis life “by a forfeiture that is irrevocable.” Ibid. (citing\nSolem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300–301 (1983)). And this\nlengthiest possible incarceration is an “especially harsh\npunishment for a juvenile,” because he will almost inevi-\ntably serve “more years and a greater percentage of his life\nin prison than an adult offender.” Graham, 560 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 19–20). The penalty when imposed on a\nteenager, as compared with an older person, is therefore\n“the same . . . in name only.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20).\nAll of that suggested a distinctive set of legal rules: In part\nbecause we viewed this ultimate penalty for juveniles as\nakin to the death penalty, we treated it similarly to that\nmost severe punishment. We imposed a categorical ban on\nthe sentence’s use, in a way unprecedented for a term of\nimprisonment. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); id., at ___\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (“For the first time\nin its history, the Court declares an entire class of offend-\ners immune from a noncapital sentence using the categori-\ncal approach it previously reserved for death penalty cases\nalone”). And the bar we adopted mirrored a proscription\nfirst established in the death penalty context—that the\npunishment cannot be imposed for any nonhomicide\ncrimes against individuals. See Kennedy, 554 U. S. 407;\nCoker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).\n   That correspondence—Graham’s “[t]reat[ment] [of]\njuvenile life sentences as analogous to capital punish-\nment,” 560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment) (slip op., at 5)—makes relevant here a second\nline of our precedents, demanding individualized sentenc-\ning when imposing the death penalty. In Woodson, 428\nU. S. 280, we held that a statute mandating a death sen-\ntence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amend-\nment. We thought the mandatory scheme flawed because\nit gave no significance to “the character and record of\nthe individual offender or the circumstances” of the offense,\nand “exclud[ed] from consideration . . . the possibility of\ncompassionate or mitigating factors.” Id., at 304. Subse-\nquent decisions have elaborated on the requirement that\ncapital defendants have an opportunity to advance, and\nthe judge or jury a chance to assess, any mitigating fac-\ntors, so that the death penalty is reserved only for the\nmost culpable defendants committing the most serious\noffenses. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 74–\n76 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112\n(1982); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 597–609 (plurality opinion).\n   Of special pertinence here, we insisted in these rulings\nthat a sentencer have the ability to consider the “mitigat-\ning qualities of youth.” Johnson v. Texas, 509 U. S. 350,\n367 (1993). Everything we said in Roper and Graham\nabout that stage of life also appears in these decisions. As\nwe observed, “youth is more than a chronological fact.”\nEddings, 455 U. S., at 115. It is a time of immaturity, ir-\nresponsibility, “impetuousness[,] and recklessness.” John-\nson, 509 U. S., at 368. It is a moment and “condition\nof life when a person may be most susceptible to influence\nand to psychological damage.” Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115.\nAnd its “signature qualities” are all “transient.” Johnson,\n509 U. S., at 368. Eddings is especially on point. There, a\n16-year-old shot a police officer point-blank and killed\nhim. We invalidated his death sentence because the judge\ndid not consider evidence of his neglectful and violent\nfamily background (including his mother’s drug abuse and\nhis father’s physical abuse) and his emotional disturbance.\n14                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nWe found that evidence “particularly relevant”—more so\nthan it would have been in the case of an adult offender.\n455 U. S., at 115. We held: “[J]ust as the chronological age\nof a minor is itself a relevant mitigating factor of great\nweight, so must the background and mental and emotional\ndevelopment of a youthful defendant be duly considered”\nin assessing his culpability. Id., at 116.\n   In light of Graham’s reasoning, these decisions too show\nthe flaws of imposing mandatory life-without-parole sen-\ntences on juvenile homicide offenders. Such mandatory\npenalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from\ntaking account of an offender’s age and the wealth of\ncharacteristics and circumstances attendant to it. Under\nthese schemes, every juvenile will receive the same sen-\ntence as every other—the 17-year-old and the 14-year-old,\nthe shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable\nhousehold and the child from a chaotic and abusive one.\nAnd still worse, each juvenile (including these two 14-\nyear-olds) will receive the same sentence as the vast ma-\njority of adults committing similar homicide offenses—but\nreally, as Graham noted, a greater sentence than those\nadults will serve.7 In meting out the death penalty, the\nelision of all these differences would be strictly forbidden.\nAnd once again, Graham indicates that a similar rule\nshould apply when a juvenile confronts a sentence of life\n(and death) in prison.\n   So Graham and Roper and our individualized sentenc-\n\n——————\n   7 Although adults are subject as well to the death penalty in many\n\njurisdictions, very few offenders actually receive that sentence. See,\ne.g., Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Rosenmerkel, M.\nDurose, & D. Farole, Felony Sentences in State Courts 2006—\nStatistical Tables, p. 28 (Table 4.4) (rev. Nov. 22, 2010). So in practice,\nthe sentencing schemes at issue here result in juvenile homicide\noffenders receiving the same nominal punishment as almost all adults,\neven though the two classes differ significantly in moral culpability and\ncapacity for change.\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning cases alike teach that in imposing a State’s harshest\npenalties, a sentencer misses too much if he treats every\nchild as an adult. To recap: Mandatory life without parole\nfor a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological\nage and its hallmark features—among them, immaturity,\nimpetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and conse-\nquences. It prevents taking into account the family and\nhome environment that surrounds him—and from which\nhe cannot usually extricate himself—no matter how bru-\ntal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the\nhomicide offense, including the extent of his participation\nin the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures\nmay have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might\nhave been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not\nfor incompetencies associated with youth—for example,\nhis inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors\n(including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist\nhis own attorneys. See, e.g., Graham, 560 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 27) (“[T]he features that distinguish juveniles\nfrom adults also put them at a significant disadvantage in\ncriminal proceedings”); J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5–6) (discussing children’s\nresponses to interrogation). And finally, this mandatory\npunishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation\neven when the circumstances most suggest it.\n   Both cases before us illustrate the problem. Take Jack-\nson’s first. As noted earlier, Jackson did not fire the bullet\nthat killed Laurie Troup; nor did the State argue that\nhe intended her death. Jackson’s conviction was instead\nbased on an aiding-and-abetting theory; and the appellate\ncourt affirmed the verdict only because the jury could have\nbelieved that when Jackson entered the store, he warned\nTroup that “[w]e ain’t playin’,” rather than told his friends\nthat “I thought you all was playin’.” See 359 Ark., at\n90–92, 194 S. W. 3d, at 759–760; supra, at 2. To be sure,\nJackson learned on the way to the video store that his\n16                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfriend Shields was carrying a gun, but his age could well\nhave affected his calculation of the risk that posed, as well\nas his willingness to walk away at that point. All these\ncircumstances go to Jackson’s culpability for the offense.\nSee Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18) (“[W]hen\ncompared to an adult murderer, a juvenile offender who\ndid not kill or intend to kill has a twice diminished moral\nculpability”). And so too does Jackson’s family background\nand immersion in violence: Both his mother and his\ngrandmother had previously shot other individuals. See\nRecord in No. 10–9647, pp. 80–82. At the least, a sen-\ntencer should look at such facts before depriving a 14-\nyear-old of any prospect of release from prison.\n   That is true also in Miller’s case. No one can doubt that\nhe and Smith committed a vicious murder. But they did it\nwhen high on drugs and alcohol consumed with the adult\nvictim. And if ever a pathological background might have\ncontributed to a 14-year-old’s commission of a crime, it is\nhere. Miller’s stepfather physically abused him; his alco-\nholic and drug-addicted mother neglected him; he had\nbeen in and out of foster care as a result; and he had tried\nto kill himself four times, the first when he should have\nbeen in kindergarten. See 928 So. 2d, at 1081 (Cobb, J.,\nconcurring in result); Miller App. 26–28; supra, at 4.\nNonetheless, Miller’s past criminal history was limited—\ntwo instances of truancy and one of “second-degree crimi-\nnal mischief.” No. CR–03–0915, at 6 (unpublished memo-\nrandum). That Miller deserved severe punishment for\nkilling Cole Cannon is beyond question. But once again,\na sentencer needed to examine all these circumstances\nbefore concluding that life without any possibility of parole\nwas the appropriate penalty.\n   We therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a\nsentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without\npossibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24) (“A State is not required\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto guarantee eventual freedom,” but must provide “some\nmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demon-\nstrated maturity and rehabilitation”). By making youth\n(and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of\nthat harshest prison sentence, such a scheme poses too\ngreat a risk of disproportionate punishment. Because that\nholding is sufficient to decide these cases, we do not con-\nsider Jackson’s and Miller’s alternative argument that\nthe Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life\nwithout parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and\nyounger. But given all we have said in Roper, Graham,\nand this decision about children’s diminished culpability\nand heightened capacity for change, we think appropriate\noccasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest possible\npenalty will be uncommon. That is especially so because\nof the great difficulty we noted in Roper and Graham of\ndistinguishing at this early age between “the juvenile of-\nfender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient\nimmaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime\nreflects irreparable corruption.” Roper, 543 U. S., at 573;\nGraham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17). Although we do\nnot foreclose a sentencer’s ability to make that judgment\nin homicide cases, we require it to take into account how\nchildren are different, and how those differences coun-\nsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in\nprison.8\n——————\n  8 Given  our holding, and the dissents’ competing position, we see a\ncertain irony in their repeated references to 17-year-olds who have\ncommitted the “most heinous” offenses, and their comparison of those\ndefendants to the 14-year-olds here. See post, at 2 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.) (noting the “17-year old [who] is convicted of deliberately murder-\ning an innocent victim”); post, at 3 (“the most heinous murders”); post,\nat 7 (“the worst types of murder”); post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.)\n(warning the reader not to be “confused by the particulars” of these two\ncases); post, at 1 (discussing the “171⁄2-year-old who sets off a bomb in\na crowded mall”). Our holding requires factfinders to attend to exactly\nsuch circumstances—to take into account the differences among de-\n18                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                                          \n\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            III\n\n                               \n\n  Alabama and Arkansas offer two kinds of arguments\nagainst requiring individualized consideration before sen-\ntencing a juvenile to life imprisonment without possi-\nbility of parole. The States (along with the dissents) first\ncontend that the rule we adopt conflicts with aspects of\nour Eighth Amendment caselaw. And they next assert\nthat the rule is unnecessary because individualized cir-\ncumstances come into play in deciding whether to try a\njuvenile offender as an adult. We think the States are\nwrong on both counts.\n                                    A\n  The States (along with JUSTICE THOMAS) first claim that\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957 (1991), precludes our\nholding. The defendant in Harmelin was sentenced to a\nmandatory life-without-parole term for possessing more\nthan 650 grams of cocaine. The Court upheld that pen-\nalty, reasoning that “a sentence which is not otherwise cruel\nand unusual” does not “becom[e] so simply because it is\n‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. We recognized that a different\nrule, requiring individualized sentencing, applied in the\ndeath penalty context. But we refused to extend that\ncommand to noncapital cases “because of the qualitative\ndifference between death and all other penalties.” Ibid.;\nsee id., at 1006 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). According to Alabama, invali-\ndating the mandatory imposition of life-without-parole\nterms on juveniles “would effectively overrule Harmelin.”\nBrief for Respondent in No. 10–9646, p. 59 (hereinafter\nAlabama Brief); see Arkansas Brief 39.\n  We think that argument myopic. Harmelin had nothing\nto do with children and did not purport to apply its hold-\n—————— \n\nfendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes that the\n        \n\ndissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors. \n\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ning to the sentencing of juvenile offenders. We have by\nnow held on multiple occasions that a sentencing rule\npermissible for adults may not be so for children. Capital\npunishment, our decisions hold, generally comports with\nthe Eighth Amendment—except it cannot be imposed on\nchildren. See Roper, 543 U. S. 551; Thompson, 487 U. S.\n815. So too, life without parole is permissible for nonhom-\nicide offenses—except, once again, for children. See Gra-\nham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). Nor are these\nsentencing decisions an oddity in the law. To the contrary,\n“ ‘[o]ur history is replete with laws and judicial recogni-\ntion’ that children cannot be viewed simply as miniature\nadults.” J. D. B., 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(quoting Eddings, 455 U. S., at 115–116, citing examples\nfrom criminal, property, contract, and tort law). So if (as\nHarmelin recognized) “death is different,” children are\ndifferent too. Indeed, it is the odd legal rule that does not\nhave some form of exception for children. In that context,\nit is no surprise that the law relating to society’s harshest\npunishments recognizes such a distinction. Cf. Graham,\n560 U. S., at ___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 7) (“Graham’s age places him in a significantly\ndifferent category from the defendan[t] in . . . Harmelin”).\nOur ruling thus neither overrules nor undermines nor con-\nflicts with Harmelin.\n    Alabama and Arkansas (along with THE CHIEF JUS-\nTICE and JUSTICE ALITO) next contend that because many\nStates impose mandatory life-without-parole sentences on\njuveniles, we may not hold the practice unconstitutional.\nIn considering categorical bars to the death penalty and\nlife without parole, we ask as part of the analysis whether\n“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed in\nlegislative enactments and state practice,’ ” show a “na-\ntional consensus” against a sentence for a particular class\nof offenders. Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). By our count, 29 juris-\n20                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndictions (28 States and the Federal Government) make\na life-without-parole term mandatory for some juveniles\nconvicted of murder in adult court.9 The States argue that\nthis number precludes our holding.\n  We do not agree; indeed, we think the States’ argument\non this score weaker than the one we rejected in Graham.\nFor starters, the cases here are different from the typical\none in which we have tallied legislative enactments. Our\ndecision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class\nof offenders or type of crime—as, for example, we did in\nRoper or Graham. Instead, it mandates only that a sen-\ntencer follow a certain process—considering an offender’s\nyouth and attendant characteristics—before imposing a\nparticular penalty. And in so requiring, our decision flows\nstraightforwardly from our precedents: specifically, the\nprinciple of Roper, Graham, and our individualized sen-\ntencing cases that youth matters for purposes of meting\nout the law’s most serious punishments. When both of\nthose circumstances have obtained in the past, we have\nnot scrutinized or relied in the same way on legislative\n——————\n  9 The  States note that 26 States and the Federal Government make\nlife without parole the mandatory (or mandatory minimum) punish-\nment for some form of murder, and would apply the relevant provision\nto 14-year-olds (with many applying it to even younger defendants).\nSee Alabama Brief 17–18. In addition, life without parole is mandatory\nfor older juveniles in Louisiana (age 15 and up) and Texas (age 17). See\nLa. Child. Code Ann., Arts. 857(A), (B) (West Supp. 2012); La. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §§14:30(C), 14:30.1(B) (West Supp. 2012); Tex. Family Code\nAnn. §§51.02(2)(A), 54.02(a)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2011); Tex. Penal Code\nAnn. §12.31(a) (West 2011). In many of these jurisdictions, life without\nparole is the mandatory punishment only for aggravated forms of\nmurder. That distinction makes no difference to our analysis. We have\nconsistently held that limiting a mandatory death penalty law to\nparticular kinds of murder cannot cure the law’s “constitutional vice” of\ndisregarding the “circumstances of the particular offense and the\ncharacter and propensities of the offender.” Roberts v. Louisiana, 428\nU. S. 325, 333 (1976) (plurality opinion); see Sumner v. Shuman, 483\nU. S. 66 (1987). The same analysis applies here, for the same reasons.\n                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                    21\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nenactments. See, e.g., Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66\n(relying on Woodson’s logic to prohibit the mandatory\ndeath penalty for murderers already serving life without\nparole); Lockett, 438 U. S., at 602–608 (plurality opinion)\n(applying Woodson to require that judges and juries\nconsider all mitigating evidence); Eddings, 455 U. S., at\n110–117 (similar). We see no difference here.\n  In any event, the “objective indicia” that the States offer\ndo not distinguish these cases from others holding that\na sentencing practice violates the Eighth Amendment. In\nGraham, we prohibited life-without-parole terms for\njuveniles committing nonhomicide offenses even though\n39 jurisdictions permitted that sentence. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). That is 10 more than impose life\nwithout parole on juveniles on a mandatory basis.10 And\n——————\n   10 In assessing indicia of societal standards, Graham discussed “ac-\n\ntual sentencing practices” in addition to legislative enactments, noting\nhow infrequently sentencers imposed the statutorily available penalty.\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). Here, we consider the constitutional-\nity of mandatory sentencing schemes—which by definition remove a\njudge’s or jury’s discretion—so no comparable gap between legislation\nand practice can exist. Rather than showing whether sentencers\nconsider life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders appropriate,\nthe number of juveniles serving this sentence, see post, at 1, 3–4\n(ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), merely reflects the number who have com-\nmitted homicide in mandatory-sentencing jurisdictions. For the same\nreason, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s comparison of ratios in this case and Gra-\nham carries little weight. He contrasts the number of mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juvenile murderers, relative to the\nnumber of juveniles arrested for murder, with “the corresponding\nnumber” of sentences in Graham (i.e., the number of life-without-parole\nsentences for juveniles who committed serious nonhomicide crimes, as\ncompared to arrests for those crimes). Post, at 4. But because the\nmandatory nature of the sentences here necessarily makes them more\ncommon, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s figures do not “correspon[d]” at all. The\nhigher ratio is mostly a function of removing the sentencer’s discretion.\n   Where mandatory sentencing does not itself account for the number\nof juveniles serving life-without-parole terms, the evidence we have of\npractice supports our holding. Fifteen jurisdictions make life without\n22                      MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nin Atkins, Roper, and Thompson, we similarly banned the\ndeath penalty in circumstances in which “less than half ”\nof the “States that permit[ted] capital punishment (for\nwhom the issue exist[ed])” had previously chosen to do so.\nAtkins, 536 U. S., at 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (emphasis\ndeleted); see id., at 313–315 (majority opinion); Roper, 543\nU. S., at 564–565; Thompson, 487 U. S., at 826–827 (plu-\nrality opinion). So we are breaking no new ground in\nthese cases.11\n  Graham and Thompson provide special guidance, be-\ncause they considered the same kind of statutes we do and\n——————\nparole discretionary for juveniles. See Alabama Brief 25 (listing 12\nStates); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.5(b) (West 2008); Ind. Code §35–50–\n2–3(b) (2011); N. M. Stat. §§31–18–13(B), 31–18–14, 31–18–15.2 (2010).\nAccording to available data, only about 15% of all juvenile life-without-\nparole sentences come from those 15 jurisdictions, while 85% come from\nthe 29 mandatory ones. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 10–9646, p. 19;\nHuman Rights Watch, State Distribution of Youth Offenders Serv-\ning Juvenile Life Without Parole (JLWOP), Oct. 2, 2009, online at\nhttp://www.hrw.org/news/2009/10/02/state-distribution-juvenile-offenders-\nserving-juvenile-life-without-parole (as visited June 21, 2012, and\navailable in Clerk of Court’s case file). That figure indicates that when\ngiven the choice, sentencers impose life without parole on children\nrelatively rarely. And contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument, see\npost, at 5, n. 2, we have held that when judges and juries do not often\nchoose to impose a sentence, it at least should not be mandatory. See\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 295–296 (1976) (plurality\nopinion) (relying on the infrequency with which juries imposed the\ndeath penalty when given discretion to hold that its mandatory imposi-\ntion violates the Eighth Amendment).\n   11 In response, THE CHIEF JUSTICE complains: “To say that a sentence\n\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures approve it\nstands precedent on its head.” Post, at 5. To be clear: That description\nin no way resembles our opinion. We hold that the sentence violates\nthe Eighth Amendment because, as we have exhaustively shown, it\nconflicts with the fundamental principles of Roper, Graham, and our\nindividualized sentencing cases. We then show why the number of\nStates imposing this punishment does not preclude our holding, and\nnote how its mandatory nature (in however many States adopt it)\nmakes use of actual sentencing numbers unilluminating.\n                    Cite as: 567 U.

Most jurisdictions authorized the death\npenalty or life without parole for juveniles only through\nthe combination of two independent statutory provisions.\nOne allowed the transfer of certain juvenile offenders to\nadult court, while another (often in a far-removed part of\nthe code) set out the penalties for any and all individuals\ntried there. We reasoned that in those circumstances, it\nwas impossible to say whether a legislature had endorsed\na given penalty for children (or would do so if presented\nwith the choice). In Thompson, we found that the statutes\n“t[old] us that the States consider 15-year-olds to be old\nenough to be tried in criminal court for serious crimes (or\ntoo old to be dealt with effectively in juvenile court),\nbut t[old] us nothing about the judgment these States\nhave made regarding the appropriate punishment for such\nyouthful offenders.” 487 U. S., at 826, n. 24 (plurality\nopinion) (emphasis deleted); see also id., at 850 (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring in judgment); Roper, 543 U. S., at 596, n.\n(O’Connor, J., dissenting). And Graham echoed that\nreasoning: Although the confluence of state laws “ma[de]\nlife without parole possible for some juvenile nonhomicide\noffenders,” it did not “justify a judgment” that many\nStates actually “intended to subject such offenders” to\nthose sentences. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).12\n   All that is just as true here. Almost all jurisdictions\nallow some juveniles to be tried in adult court for some\n——————\n  12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE attempts to distinguish Graham on this point,\n\narguing that there “the extreme rarity with which the sentence in\nquestion was imposed could suggest that legislatures did not really\nintend the inevitable result of the laws they passed.” Post, at 6. But\nneither Graham nor Thompson suggested such reasoning, presumably\nbecause the time frame makes it difficult to comprehend. Those cases\nconsidered what legislators intended when they enacted, at different\nmoments, separate juvenile-transfer and life-without-parole provi-\nsions—by definition, before they knew or could know how many juve-\nnile life-without-parole sentences would result.\n24                      MILLER v.

Snyder & M.\nSickmund, Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 2006 National\nReport 110–114 (hereinafter 2006 National Report). But\nmost States do not have separate penalty provisions for\nthose juvenile offenders. Of the 29 jurisdictions mandat-\ning life without parole for children, more than half do so\nby virtue of generally applicable penalty provisions, im-\nposing the sentence without regard to age.13 And indeed,\nsome of those States set no minimum age for who may be\ntransferred to adult court in the first instance, thus apply-\ning life-without-parole mandates to children of any age—\nbe it 17 or 14 or 10 or 6.14 As in Graham, we think that\n“underscores that the statutory eligibility of a juvenile\noffender for life without parole does not indicate that the\npenalty has been endorsed through deliberate, express,\nand full legislative consideration.” 560 U.

ALABAMA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAdults: An Analysis of State Transfer Laws and Reporting\n5 (2011).\n   Even when States give transfer-stage discretion to\njudges, it has limited utility. First, the decisionmaker\ntypically will have only partial information at this early,\npretrial stage about either the child or the circumstances\nof his offense. Miller’s case provides an example. As\nnoted earlier, see n. 3, supra, the juvenile court denied\nMiller’s request for his own mental-health expert at the\ntransfer hearing, and the appeals court affirmed on the\nground that Miller was not then entitled to the protections\nand services he would receive at trial. See No. CR–03–\n0915, at 3–4 (unpublished memorandum). But by then, of\ncourse, the expert’s testimony could not change the sen-\ntence; whatever she said in mitigation, the mandatory\nlife-without-parole prison term would kick in. The key mo-\nment for the exercise of discretion is the transfer—and as\nMiller’s case shows, the judge often does not know then\nwhat she will learn, about the offender or the offense, over\nthe course of the proceedings.\n   Second and still more important, the question at trans-\nfer hearings may differ dramatically from the issue at a\npost-trial sentencing. Because many juvenile systems\nrequire that the offender be released at a particular age or\nafter a certain number of years, transfer decisions often\npresent a choice between extremes: light punishment as a\nchild or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without\nparole). In many States, for example, a child convicted in\njuvenile court must be released from custody by the age of\n21. See, e.g., Ala. Code §12–15–117(a) (Cum. Supp. 2011);\nsee generally 2006 National Report 103 (noting limitations\non the length of juvenile court sanctions). Discretionary\nsentencing in adult court would provide different options:\nThere, a judge or jury could choose, rather than a life-\nwithout-parole sentence, a lifetime prison term with the\npossibility of parole or a lengthy term of years. It is easy\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto imagine a judge deciding that a minor deserves a\n(much) harsher sentence than he would receive in juvenile\ncourt, while still not thinking life-without-parole appro-\npriate. For that reason, the discretion available to a judge\nat the transfer stage cannot substitute for discretion at\npost-trial sentencing in adult court—and so cannot satisfy\nthe Eighth Amendment.\n                             IV\n   Graham, Roper, and our individualized sentencing\ndecisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the\nopportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before\nimposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By\nrequiring that all children convicted of homicide receive\nlifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regard-\nless of their age and age-related characteristics and the\nnature of their crimes, the mandatory sentencing schemes\nbefore us violate this principle of proportionality, and so\nthe Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual pun-\nishment. We accordingly reverse the judgments of the\nArkansas Supreme Court and Alabama Court of Criminal\nAppeals and remand the cases for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

I add that, if the State\ncontinues to seek a sentence of life without the possibil-\nity of parole for Kuntrell Jackson, there will have to be a\ndetermination whether Jackson “kill[ed] or intend[ed] to\nkill” the robbery victim. Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). In my view, without such a\nfinding, the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in Graham\nforbids sentencing Jackson to such a sentence, regardless\nof whether its application is mandatory or discretionary\nunder state law.\n   In Graham we said that “when compared to an adult\nmurderer, a juvenile offender who did not kill or intend to\nkill has a twice diminished moral culpability.” Ibid. (em-\nphasis added). For one thing, “compared to adults, juve-\nniles have a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense\n2                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nof responsibility; they are more vulnerable or susceptible\nto negative influences and outside pressures, including\npeer pressure; and their characters are not as well\nformed.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). See also ibid. (“[P]sychology and brain\nscience continue to show fundamental differences between\njuvenile and adult minds” making their actions “less likely\nto be evidence of ‘irretrievably depraved character’ than\nare the actions of adults” (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543\nU. S. 551, 570 (2005))); ante, at 8–9. For another thing,\nGraham recognized that lack of intent normally dimin-\nishes the “moral culpability” that attaches to the crime in\nquestion, making those that do not intend to kill “categori-\ncally less deserving of the most serious forms of punish-\nment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n18) (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U. S. 407, 434–435\n(2008); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982); Tison v.\nArizona, 481 U. S. 137 (1987)). And we concluded that,\nbecause of this “twice diminished moral culpability,” the\nEighth Amendment forbids the imposition upon juveniles\nof a sentence of life without parole for nonhomicide cases.\nGraham, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 18, 32).\n  Given Graham’s reasoning, the kinds of homicide that\ncan subject a juvenile offender to life without parole must\nexclude instances where the juvenile himself neither kills\nnor intends to kill the victim. Quite simply, if the juvenile\neither kills or intends to kill the victim, he lacks “twice\ndiminished” responsibility. But where the juvenile neither\nkills nor intends to kill, both features emphasized in Gra-\nham as extenuating apply. The dissent itself here would\npermit life without parole for “juveniles who commit the\nworst types of murder,” post, at 7 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.), but that phrase does not readily fit the culpability of\none who did not himself kill or intend to kill.\n  I recognize that in the context of felony-murder cases,\nthe question of intent is a complicated one. The felony-\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nmurder doctrine traditionally attributes death caused in\nthe course of a felony to all participants who intended to\ncommit the felony, regardless of whether they killed or\nintended to kill. See 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal\nLaw §§14.5(a) and (c) (2d ed. 2003). This rule has been\nbased on the idea of “transferred intent”; the defendant’s\nintent to commit the felony satisfies the intent to kill\nrequired for murder. See S. Kadish, S. Schulhofer, & C.\nStreiker, Criminal Law and Its Processes 439 (8th ed.\n2007); 2 C. Torcia, Wharton’s Criminal Law §147 (15th ed.\n1994).\n   But in my opinion, this type of “transferred intent” is\nnot sufficient to satisfy the intent to murder that could\nsubject a juvenile to a sentence of life without parole. As\nan initial matter, this Court has made clear that this\nartificially constructed kind of intent does not count as\nintent for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. We do not\nrely on transferred intent in determining if an adult may\nreceive the death penalty. Thus, the Constitution forbids\nimposing capital punishment upon an aider and abettor in\na robbery, where that individual did not intend to kill and\nsimply was “in the car by the side of the road . . . , waiting\nto help the robbers escape.” Enmund, supra, at 788. Cf.\nTison, supra, at 157–158 (capital punishment permissi-\nble for aider and abettor where kidnaping led to death\nbecause he was “actively involved” in every aspect of the\nkidnaping and his behavior showed “a reckless disregard\nfor human life”). Given Graham, this holding applies to\njuvenile sentences of life without parole a fortiori. See\nante, at 12–13. Indeed, even juveniles who meet the Tison\nstandard of “reckless disregard” may not be eligible for life\nwithout parole. Rather, Graham dictates a clear rule: The\nonly juveniles who may constitutionally be sentenced to\nlife without parole are those convicted of homicide offenses\nwho “kill or intend to kill.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 18).\n4                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\n   Moreover, regardless of our law with respect to adults,\nthere is no basis for imposing a sentence of life without\nparole upon a juvenile who did not himself kill or intend to\nkill. At base, the theory of transferring a defendant’s\nintent is premised on the idea that one engaged in a dan-\ngerous felony should understand the risk that the victim\nof the felony could be killed, even by a confederate. See 2\nLaFave, supra, §14.5(c). Yet the ability to consider the\nfull consequences of a course of action and to adjust one’s\nconduct accordingly is precisely what we know juveniles\nlack capacity to do effectively. Ante, at 8–9. Justice Frank-\nfurter cautioned, “Legal theories and their phrasing in\nother cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning if uncrit-\nically transferred to a determination of a State’s duty to-\nward children.” May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528, 536\n(1953) (concurring opinion). To apply the doctrine of\ntransferred intent here, where the juvenile did not kill, to\nsentence a juvenile to life without parole would involve\nsuch “fallacious reasoning.” Ibid.\n   This is, as far as I can tell, precisely the situation pres-\nent in Kuntrell Jackson’s case. Jackson simply went\nalong with older boys to rob a video store. On the way, he\nbecame aware that a confederate had a gun. He initially\nstayed outside the store, and went in briefly, saying some-\nthing like “We ain’t playin’ ” or “ ‘I thought you all was\nplayin,’ ” before an older confederate shot and killed the\nstore clerk. Jackson v. State, 359 Ark. 87, 91, 194 S. W. 3d\n757, 760 (2004). Crucially, the jury found him guilty of\nfirst-degree murder under a statute that permitted them\nto convict if, Jackson “attempted to commit or committed\nan aggravated robbery, and, in the course of that of-\nfense, he, or an accomplice, caused [the clerk’s] death\nunder circumstance manifesting extreme indifference to the\nvalue of human life.” Ibid. See Ark. Code Ann. §5–10–\n101(a)(1) (1997); ante, at 15. Thus, to be found guilty,\nJackson did not need to kill the clerk (it is conceded he did\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., concurring\n\nnot), nor did he need to have intent to kill or even “ex-\ntreme indifference.” As long as one of the teenage accom-\nplices in the robbery acted with extreme indifference to\nthe value of human life, Jackson could be convicted of\ncapital murder. Ibid.\n   The upshot is that Jackson, who did not kill the clerk,\nmight not have intended to do so either. See Jackson v.\nNorris, 2011 Ark. 49, at 10, ___ S. W. 3d ___ (Danielson,\nJ., dissenting) (“[A]ny evidence of [Jackson’s] intent to kill\nwas severely lacking”). In that case, the Eighth Amend-\nment simply forbids imposition of a life term without the\npossibility of parole. If, on remand, however, there is a\nfinding that Jackson did intend to cause the clerk’s death,\nthe question remains open whether the Eighth Amend-\nment prohibits the imposition of life without parole upon a\njuvenile in those circumstances as well.

Our role, however, is to\napply the law, not to answer such questions. The perti-\nnent law here is the Eighth Amendment to the Constitu-\ntion, which prohibits “cruel and unusual punishments.”\nToday, the Court invokes that Amendment to ban a pun-\nishment that the Court does not itself characterize as un-\nusual, and that could not plausibly be described as such.\nI therefore dissent.\n   The parties agree that nearly 2,500 prisoners are pres-\nently serving life sentences without the possibility of pa-\nrole for murders they committed before the age of 18.\nBrief for Petitioner in No. 10–9647, p. 62, n. 80 (Jackson\n2                    MILLER v.

Put simply, if a 17-\nyear-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent\nvictim, it is not “unusual” for the murderer to receive a\nmandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality\nshould preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment\nfor juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   Our precedent supports this conclusion. When deter-\nmining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual, this\nCourt typically begins with “ ‘objective indicia of society’s\nstandards, as expressed in legislative enactments and\nstate practice.’ ” Graham v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 10); see also, e.g., Kennedy v. Louisiana,\n554 U. S. 407, 422 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543\nU. S. 551, 564 (2005). We look to these “objective indicia” to\nensure that we are not simply following our own subjective\nvalues or beliefs. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 173\n(1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).\nSuch tangible evidence of societal standards enables us to\ndetermine whether there is a “consensus against” a given\nsentencing practice. Graham, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n10). If there is, the punishment may be regarded as “un-\nusual.” But when, as here, most States formally require\nand frequently impose the punishment in question, there\nis no objective basis for that conclusion.\n   Our Eighth Amendment cases have also said that we\nshould take guidance from “evolving standards of decency\nthat mark the progress of a maturing society.” Ante, at 6\n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 102 (1976); inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Mercy toward the guilty\ncan be a form of decency, and a maturing society may\nabandon harsh punishments that it comes to view as\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

A mature society may determine that this re-\nquires removing those guilty of the most heinous murders\nfrom its midst, both as protection for its other members\nand as a concrete expression of its standards of decency.\nAs judges we have no basis for deciding that progress\ntoward greater decency can move only in the direction of\neasing sanctions on the guilty.\n   In this case, there is little doubt about the direction of\nsociety’s evolution: For most of the 20th century, American\nsentencing practices emphasized rehabilitation of the\noffender and the availability of parole. But by the 1980’s,\noutcry against repeat offenders, broad disaffection with\nthe rehabilitative model, and other factors led many legis-\nlatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole,\nimposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals\nand prevent them from committing more crimes. See, e.g.,\nAlschuler, The Changing Purposes of Criminal Punish-\nment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 1–13 (2003); see generally\nCrime and Public Policy (J. Wilson & J. Petersilia eds.\n2011). Statutes establishing life without parole sentences\nin particular became more common in the past quarter\ncentury. See Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 78, and n. 10\n(2008) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). And the\nparties agree that most States have changed their laws\nrelatively recently to expose teenage murderers to manda-\ntory life without parole. Jackson Brief 54–55; Alabama\nBrief 4–5.\n   The Court attempts to avoid the import of the fact that\nso many jurisdictions have embraced the sentencing prac-\ntice at issue by comparing this case to the Court’s prior\nEighth Amendment cases. The Court notes that Graham\nfound a punishment authorized in 39 jurisdictions uncon-\nstitutional, whereas the punishment it bans today is\nmandated in 10 fewer. Ante, at 21. But Graham went to\n4                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nconsiderable lengths to show that although theoretically\nallowed in many States, the sentence at issue in that case\nwas “exceedingly rare” in practice. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16). The Court explained that only 123 prisoners\nin the entire Nation were serving life without parole for\nnonhomicide crimes committed as juveniles, with more\nthan half in a single State. It contrasted that with statis-\ntics showing nearly 400,000 juveniles were arrested for\nserious nonhomicide offenses in a single year. Based on\nthe sentence’s rarity despite the many opportunities to im-\npose it, Graham concluded that there was a national\nconsensus against life without parole for juvenile nonhom-\nicide crimes. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–16).\n   Here the number of mandatory life without parole sen-\ntences for juvenile murderers, relative to the number of\njuveniles arrested for murder, is over 5,000 times higher\nthan the corresponding number in Graham. There is thus\nnothing in this case like the evidence of national consen-\nsus in Graham.1\n   The Court disregards these numbers, claiming that the\nprevalence of the sentence in question results from the\nnumber of statutes requiring its imposition. Ante, at 21,\nn. 10. True enough. The sentence at issue is statutorily\nmandated life without parole. Such a sentence can only\nresult from statutes requiring its imposition. In Graham\nthe Court relied on the low number of actual sentences to\nexplain why the high number of statutes allowing such\n——————\n  1 Graham stated that 123 prisoners were serving life without parole\n\nfor nonhomicide offenses committed as juveniles, while in 2007 alone\n380,480 juveniles were arrested for serious nonhomicide crimes. 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14). I use 2,000 as the number of prisoners\nserving mandatory life without parole sentences for murders committed\nas juveniles, because all seem to accept that the number is at least that\nhigh. And the same source Graham used reports that 1,170 juveniles\nwere arrested for murder and nonnegligent homicide in 2009. Dept.\nof Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,\nC.

J., dissenting\n\nsentences was not dispositive. Here, the Court excuses\nthe high number of actual sentences by citing the high\nnumber of statutes imposing it. To say that a sentence\nmay be considered unusual because so many legislatures\napprove it stands precedent on its head.2\n  The Court also advances another reason for discounting\nthe laws enacted by Congress and most state legisla-\ntures. Some of the jurisdictions that impose mandatory life\nwithout parole on juvenile murderers do so as a result of\ntwo statutes: one providing that juveniles charged with\nserious crimes may be tried as adults, and another gener-\nally mandating that those convicted of murder be impris-\noned for life. According to the Court, our cases suggest\nthat where the sentence results from the interaction of two\nsuch statutes, the legislature can be considered to have\nimposed the resulting sentences “inadvertent[ly].” Ante,\nat 22–25. The Court relies on Graham and Thompson v.\nOklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 826, n. 24 (1988) (plurality\nopinion), for the proposition that these laws are therefore\nnot valid evidence of society’s views on the punishment at\nissue.\n  It is a fair question whether this Court should ever\nassume a legislature is so ignorant of its own laws that it\ndoes not understand that two of them interact with each\n——————\n   2 The Court’s reference to discretionary sentencing practices is a dis-\n\ntraction. See ante, at 21–22, n. 10. The premise of the Court’s decision\nis that mandatory sentences are categorically different from discretion-\nary ones. So under the Court’s own logic, whether discretionary sen-\ntences are common or uncommon has nothing to do with whether\nmandatory sentences are unusual. In any event, if analysis of discre-\ntionary sentences were relevant, it would not provide objective support\nfor today’s decision. The Court states that “about 15% of all juvenile\nlife-without-parole sentences”—meaning nearly 400 sentences—were\nimposed at the discretion of a judge or jury. Ante, at 22, n. 10. Thus\nthe number of discretionary life without parole sentences for juvenile\nmurderers, relative to the number of juveniles arrested for murder, is\nabout 1,000 times higher than the corresponding number in Graham.\n6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nother, especially on an issue of such importance as the one\nbefore us. But in Graham and Thompson it was at least\nplausible as a practical matter. In Graham, the extreme\nrarity with which the sentence in question was imposed\ncould suggest that legislatures did not really intend the\ninevitable result of the laws they passed. See 560 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 15–16). In Thompson, the sentencing\npractice was even rarer—only 20 defendants had received\nit in the last century. 487 U. S., at 832 (plurality opinion).\nPerhaps under those facts it could be argued that the leg-\nislature was not fully aware that a teenager could re-\nceive the particular sentence in question. But here the\nwidespread and recent imposition of the sentence makes it\nimplausible to characterize this sentencing practice as a\ncollateral consequence of legislative ignorance.3\n   Nor do we display our usual respect for elected officials\nby asserting that legislators have accidentally required\n2,000 teenagers to spend the rest of their lives in jail. This\nis particularly true given that our well-publicized decision\nin Graham alerted legislatures to the possibility that\nteenagers were subject to life with parole only because of\nlegislative inadvertence. I am aware of no effort in the\nwake of Graham to correct any supposed legislative over-\nsight. Indeed, in amending its laws in response to Gra-\nham one legislature made especially clear that it does\nintend juveniles who commit first-degree murder to re-\nceive mandatory life without parole. See Iowa Code Ann.\n§902.1 (West Cum. Supp. 2012).\n   In the end, the Court does not actually conclude that\nmandatory life sentences for juvenile murderers are un-\nusual. It instead claims that precedent “leads to” today’s\n\n——————\n    3 The\n        Court claims that I “take issue with some or all of these prece-\ndents” and “seek to relitigate” them.

Petitioners argue that the reasoning of those cases\n“compels” finding in their favor. Jackson Brief 34. The\nCourt is apparently unwilling to go so far, asserting only\nthat precedent points in that direction. But today’s deci-\nsion invalidates the laws of dozens of legislatures and\nCongress. This Court is not easily led to such a result.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 635 (1883)\n(courts must presume an Act of Congress is constitutional\n“unless the lack of constitutional authority . . . is clearly\ndemonstrated”). Because the Court does not rely on the\nEighth Amendment’s text or objective evidence of society’s\nstandards, its analysis of precedent alone must bear the\n“heavy burden [that] rests on those who would attack the\njudgment of the representatives of the people.” Gregg, 428\nU. S., at 175. If the Court is unwilling to say that prece-\ndent compels today’s decision, perhaps it should reconsider\nthat decision.\n  In any event, the Court’s holding does not follow from\nRoper and Graham. Those cases undoubtedly stand for\nthe proposition that teenagers are less mature, less re-\nsponsible, and less fixed in their ways than adults—not\nthat a Supreme Court case was needed to establish that.\nWhat they do not stand for, and do not even suggest, is\nthat legislators—who also know that teenagers are differ-\nent from adults—may not require life without parole for\njuveniles who commit the worst types of murder.\n  That Graham does not imply today’s result could not be\nclearer. In barring life without parole for juvenile non-\nhomicide offenders, Graham stated that “[t]here is a line\n‘between homicide and other serious violent offenses\nagainst the individual.’ ” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18)\n(quoting Kennedy, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 27)). The\nwhole point of drawing a line between one issue and an-\nother is to say that they are different and should be\ntreated differently. In other words, the two are in different\n8                    MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncategories. Which Graham also said: “defendants who do\nnot kill, intend to kill, or foresee that life will be taken are\ncategorically less deserving of the most serious forms of\npunishment than are murderers.” 560 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 18) (emphasis added). Of course, to be especially\nclear that what is said about one issue does not apply to\nanother, one could say that the two issues cannot be com-\npared. Graham said that too: “Serious nonhomicide\ncrimes . . . cannot be compared to murder.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). A case that expressly puts an\nissue in a different category from its own subject, draws a\nline between the two, and states that the two should not\nbe compared, cannot fairly be said to control that issue.\n   Roper provides even less support for the Court’s holding.\nIn that case, the Court held that the death penalty could\nnot be imposed for offenses committed by juveniles, no\nmatter how serious their crimes. In doing so, Roper also\nset itself in a different category than this case, by ex-\npressly invoking “special” Eighth Amendment analysis for\ndeath penalty cases. 543 U. S., at 568–569. But more\nimportantly, Roper reasoned that the death penalty was\nnot needed to deter juvenile murderers in part because\n“life imprisonment without the possibility of parole” was\navailable. Id., at 572. In a classic bait and switch, the\nCourt now tells state legislatures that—Roper’s promise\nnotwithstanding—they do not have power to guarantee\nthat once someone commits a heinous murder, he will\nnever do so again. It would be enough if today’s decision\nproved JUSTICE SCALIA’s prescience in writing that Roper’s\n“reassurance . . . gives little comfort.” Id., at 623 (dissent-\ning opinion). To claim that Roper actually “leads to” re-\nvoking its own reassurance surely goes too far.\n   Today’s decision does not offer Roper and Graham’s\nfalse promises of restraint. Indeed, the Court’s opinion\nsuggests that it is merely a way station on the path to\nfurther judicial displacement of the legislative role in\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           9\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nprescribing appropriate punishment for crime.          The\nCourt’s analysis focuses on the mandatory nature of the\nsentences in this case. See ante, at 11–17. But then—\nalthough doing so is entirely unnecessary to the rule it\nannounces—the Court states that even when a life with-\nout parole sentence is not mandatory, “we think appropri-\nate occasions for sentencing juveniles to this harshest\npossible penalty will be uncommon.” Ante, at 17. Today’s\nholding may be limited to mandatory sentences, but the\nCourt has already announced that discretionary life with-\nout parole for juveniles should be “uncommon”—or, to use\na common synonym, “unusual.”\n   Indeed, the Court’s gratuitous prediction appears to be\nnothing other than an invitation to overturn life without\nparole sentences imposed by juries and trial judges. If\nthat invitation is widely accepted and such sentences for\njuvenile offenders do in fact become “uncommon,” the\nCourt will have bootstrapped its way to declaring that the\nEighth Amendment absolutely prohibits them.\n   This process has no discernible end point—or at least\nnone consistent with our Nation’s legal traditions. Roper\nand Graham attempted to limit their reasoning to the\ncircumstances they addressed—Roper to the death penalty,\nand Graham to nonhomicide crimes. Having cast aside\nthose limits, the Court cannot now offer a credible substi-\ntute, and does not even try. After all, the Court tells us,\n“none of what [Graham] said about children . . . is crime-\nspecific.” Ante, at 10. The principle behind today’s deci-\nsion seems to be only that because juveniles are different\nfrom adults, they must be sentenced differently. See ante,\nat 14–17. There is no clear reason that principle would\nnot bar all mandatory sentences for juveniles, or any\njuvenile sentence as harsh as what a similarly situated\nadult would receive. Unless confined, the only stopping\npoint for the Court’s analysis would be never permitting\njuvenile offenders to be tried as adults. Learning that an\n10                  MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nAmendment that bars only “unusual” punishments re-\nquires the abolition of this uniformly established practice\nwould be startling indeed.\n                        *     *    *\n  It is a great tragedy when a juvenile commits murder—\nmost of all for the innocent victims. But also for the mur-\nderer, whose life has gone so wrong so early. And for\nsociety as well, which has lost one or more of its members\nto deliberate violence, and must harshly punish another.\nIn recent years, our society has moved toward requiring\nthat the murderer, his age notwithstanding, be imprisoned\nfor the remainder of his life. Members of this Court may\ndisagree with that choice. Perhaps science and policy\nsuggest society should show greater mercy to young kill-\ners, giving them a greater chance to reform themselves at\nthe risk that they will kill again. See ante, at 8–11. But\nthat is not our decision to make. Neither the text of the\nConstitution nor our precedent prohibits legislatures from\nrequiring that juvenile murderers be sentenced to life\nwithout parole.

To reach\nthat result, the Court relies on two lines of precedent. The\nfirst involves the categorical prohibition of certain pun-\nishments for specified classes of offenders. The second\nrequires individualized sentencing in the capital punish-\nment context. Neither line is consistent with the original\nunderstanding of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause.

Of these categorical propor-\ntionality cases, the Court places particular emphasis on\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U. S. 551 (2005), and Graham v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010). In Roper, the Court held\nthat the Constitution prohibits the execution of an offender\nwho was under 18 at the time of his offense. 543 U. S.,\nat 578. The Roper Court looked to, among other things, its\nown sense of parental intuition and “scientific and socio-\nlogical studies” to conclude that offenders under the age of\n18 “cannot with reliability be classified among the worst\noffenders.” Id., at 569. In Graham, the Court relied on\nsimilar considerations to conclude that the Constitution\nprohibits a life-without-parole sentence for a nonhomicide\noffender who was under the age of 18 at the time of his\noffense. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24).\n   The Court now concludes that mandatory life-without-\nparole sentences for duly convicted juvenile murderers\n“contraven[e] Graham’s (and also Roper’s) foundational\nprinciple: that imposition of a State’s most severe penal-\nties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they\nwere not children.” Ante, at 11–12. But neither Roper nor\nGraham held that specific procedural rules are required\nfor sentencing juvenile homicide offenders. And, the logic\nof those cases should not be extended to create such a\nrequirement.\n   The Eighth Amendment, made applicable to the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that: “Excessive\n——————\n  1 I join THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion because it accurately explains\n\nthat, even accepting the Court’s precedents, the Court’s holding in\ntoday’s cases is unsupportable.\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

Cali-\nfornia, 538 U. S. 11, 32 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment); see generally Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S.\n957, 975–985 (1991) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). In short, it\ndoes not authorize courts to invalidate any punishment\nthey deem disproportionate to the severity of the crime\nor to a particular class of offenders. Instead, the clause\n“leaves the unavoidably moral question of who ‘deserves’ a\nparticular nonprohibited method of punishment to the\njudgment of the legislatures that authorize the penalty.”\nGraham, supra, at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n   The legislatures of Arkansas and Alabama, like those of\n27 other jurisdictions, ante, at 19–20, have determined\n——————\n  2 Neither the Court nor petitioners argue that petitioners’ sentences\n\nwould have been among “the ‘modes or acts of punishment that had\nbeen considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill of Rights\nwas adopted.’ ” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 10, n. 3) (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405 (1986)).\nNor could they. Petitioners were 14 years old at the time they commit-\nted their crimes. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, 14-year-olds\nwere subject to trial and punishment as adult offenders. See Roper v.\nSimmons, 543 U. S. 551, 609, n. 1 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\nFurther, mandatory death sentences were common at that time. See\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 994–995 (1991). It is therefore\nimplausible that a 14-year-old’s mandatory prison sentence—of any\nlength, with or without parole—would have been viewed as cruel and\nunusual.\n4                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthat all offenders convicted of specified homicide offenses,\nwhether juveniles or not, deserve a sentence of life in\nprison without the possibility of parole. Nothing in our\nConstitution authorizes this Court to supplant that choice.\n                             II\n   To invalidate mandatory life-without-parole sentences\nfor juveniles, the Court also relies on its cases “prohib-\nit[ing] mandatory imposition of capital punishment.”\nAnte, at 7. The Court reasons that, because Graham\ncompared juvenile life-without-parole sentences to the\ndeath penalty, the “distinctive set of legal rules” that this\nCourt has imposed in the capital punishment context,\nincluding the requirement of individualized sentencing, is\n“relevant” here. Ante, at 12–13. But even accepting an\nanalogy between capital and juvenile life-without-parole\nsentences, this Court’s cases prohibiting mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing schemes have no basis in the original un-\nderstanding of the Eighth Amendment, and, thus, cannot\njustify a prohibition of sentencing schemes that mandate\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles.\n                               A\n   In a line of cases following Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S.\n238 (1972) (per curiam), this Court prohibited the manda-\ntory imposition of the death penalty. See Woodson v.\nNorth Carolina, 428 U. S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion);\nRoberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (same); Sumner\nv. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66 (1987). Furman first announced\nthe principle that States may not permit sentencers to\nexercise unguided discretion in imposing the death pen-\nalty. See generally 408 U. S. 238. In response to Furman,\nmany States passed new laws that made the death pen-\nalty mandatory following conviction of specified crimes,\nthereby eliminating the offending discretion. See Gregg\nv.

The Court invali-\ndated those statutes in Woodson, Roberts, and Sumner.\nThe Court reasoned that mandatory capital sentencing\nschemes were problematic, because they failed “to allow\nthe particularized consideration” of “relevant facets of the\ncharacter and record of the individual offender or the\ncircumstances of the particular offense.” Woodson, supra,\nat 303–304 (plurality opinion).3\n   In my view, Woodson and its progeny were wrongly\ndecided. As discussed above, the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishments Clause, as originally understood, prohibits\n“torturous methods of punishment.” See Graham, 560\nU. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). It is not concerned with\nwhether a particular lawful method of punishment—\nwhether capital or noncapital—is imposed pursuant to a\nmandatory or discretionary sentencing regime. See Gard-\nner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371 (1977) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting) (“The prohibition of the Eighth Amendment\nrelates to the character of the punishment, and not to the\nprocess by which it is imposed”). In fact, “[i]n the early\ndays of the Republic,” each crime generally had a defined\npunishment “prescribed with specificity by the legisla-\nture.” United States v. Grayson, 438 U. S. 41, 45 (1978).\nCapital sentences, to which the Court analogizes, were\n——————\n  3 The Court later extended Woodson, requiring that capital defend-\n\nants be permitted to present, and sentencers in capital cases be permit-\nted to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence, including the age of\nthe defendant. See, e.g., Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 597–608 (1978)\n(plurality opinion); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110–112\n(1982); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 4–5 (1986); Johnson v.\nTexas, 509 U. S. 350, 361–368 (1993). Whatever the validity of the\nrequirement that sentencers be permitted to consider all mitigating\nevidence when deciding whether to impose a nonmandatory capital\nsentence, the Court certainly was wrong to prohibit mandatory capital\nsentences. See Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 488–500 (1993)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).\n6                   MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntreated no differently. “[M]andatory death sentences\nabounded in our first Penal Code” and were “common in\nthe several States—both at the time of the founding and\nthroughout the 19th century.” Harmelin, 501 U. S., at\n994–995; see also Woodson, supra, at 289 (plurality opin-\nion) (“At the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted\nin 1791, the States uniformly followed the common-law\npractice of making death the exclusive and mandatory\nsentence for certain specified offenses”). Accordingly, the\nidea that the mandatory imposition of an otherwise-\nconstitutional sentence renders that sentence cruel and\nunusual finds “no support in the text and history of the\nEighth Amendment.” Harmelin, supra, at 994.\n   Moreover, mandatory death penalty schemes were “a\nperfectly reasonable legislative response to the concerns\nexpressed in Furman” regarding unguided sentencing\ndiscretion, in that they “eliminat[ed] explicit jury discre-\ntion and treat[ed] all defendants equally.” Graham v.\nCollins, 506 U. S. 461, 487 (1993) (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring). And, as Justice White explained more than 30 years\nago, “a State is not constitutionally forbidden to provide\nthat the commission of certain crimes conclusively estab-\nlishes that a criminal’s character is such that he deserves\ndeath.” Roberts, supra, at 358 (dissenting opinion). Thus,\nthere is no basis for concluding that a mandatory capi-\ntal sentencing scheme is unconstitutional. Because the\nCourt’s cases requiring individualized sentencing in the\ncapital context are wrongly decided, they cannot serve as a\nvalid foundation for the novel rule regarding mandatory\nlife-without-parole sentences for juveniles that the Court\nannounces today.\n                             B\n   In any event, this Court has already declined to extend\nits individualized-sentencing rule beyond the death pen-\nalty context. In Harmelin, the defendant was convicted of\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npossessing a large quantity of drugs. 501 U. S., at 961\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.). In accordance with Michigan\nlaw, he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison\nwithout the possibility of parole. Ibid. Citing the same\nline of death penalty precedents on which the Court relies\ntoday, the defendant argued that his sentence, due to its\nmandatory nature, violated the Cruel and Unusual Pun-\nishments Clause. Id., at 994–995 (opinion of the Court).\n   The Court rejected that argument, explaining that\n“[t]here can be no serious contention . . . that a sentence\nwhich is not otherwise cruel and unusual becomes so sim-\nply because it is ‘mandatory.’ ” Id., at 995. In so doing,\nthe Court refused to analogize to its death penalty cases.\nThe Court noted that those cases had “repeatedly suggested\nthat there is no comparable [individualized-sentencing]\nrequirement outside the capital context, because of the\nqualitative difference between death and all other penal-\nties.” Ibid. The Court observed that, “even where the\ndifference” between a sentence of life without parole and\nother sentences of imprisonment “is the greatest,” such\na sentence “cannot be compared with death.” Id., at 996.\nTherefore, the Court concluded that the line of cases re-\nquiring individualized sentencing had been drawn at cap-\nital cases, and that there was “no basis for extending it\nfurther.” Ibid.\n   Harmelin’s reasoning logically extends to these cases.\nObviously, the younger the defendant, “the great[er]” the\ndifference between a sentence of life without parole and\nother terms of imprisonment. Ibid. But under Harmelin’s\nrationale, the defendant’s age is immaterial to the Eighth\nAmendment analysis. Thus, the result in today’s cases\nshould be the same as that in Harmelin. Petitioners, like\nthe defendant in Harmelin, were not sentenced to death.\nAccordingly, this Court’s cases “creating and clarifying the\nindividualized capital sentencing doctrine” do not apply.\nId., at 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n8                        MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n  Nothing about our Constitution, or about the qualitative\ndifference between any term of imprisonment and death,\nhas changed since Harmelin was decided 21 years ago.\nWhat has changed (or, better yet, “evolved”) is this Court’s\never-expanding line of categorical proportionality cases.\nThe Court now uses Roper and Graham to jettison Har-\nmelin’s clear distinction between capital and noncapital\ncases and to apply the former to noncapital juvenile of-\nfenders.4 The Court’s decision to do so is even less sup-\nportable than the precedents used to reach it.\n                             III\n   As THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes, ante, at 8–9 (dissenting\nopinion), the Court lays the groundwork for future incur-\nsions on the States’ authority to sentence criminals. In its\ncategorical proportionality cases, the Court has considered\n“ ‘objective indicia of society’s standards, as expressed\nin legislative enactments and state practice’ to determine\nwhether there is a national consensus against the sentenc-\ning practice at issue.” Graham, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10) (quoting Roper, 543 U. S., at 563). In Graham, for\nexample, the Court looked to “[a]ctual sentencing prac-\ntices” to conclude that there was a national consensus\nagainst life-without-parole sentences for juvenile nonhom-\nicide offenders. 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11–14);\nsee also Roper, supra, at 564–565; Atkins v. Virginia, 536\nU.

Even a 17½-year-old who sets off a bomb in a\ncrowded mall or guns down a dozen students and teach-\ners is a “child” and must be given a chance to persuade\na judge to permit his release into society. Nothing in\nthe Constitution supports this arrogation of legislative\nauthority.\n  The Court long ago abandoned the original meaning of\nthe Eighth Amendment, holding instead that the prohi-\nbition of “cruel and unusual punishment” embodies the\n“evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a\nmaturing society.” Trop v.

Both the provenance and philosoph-\nical basis for this standard were problematic from the\nstart. (Is it true that our society is inexorably evolving in\nthe direction of greater and greater decency? Who says\nso, and how did this particular philosophy of history find\nits way into our fundamental law? And in any event,\naren’t elected representatives more likely than unaccount­\nable judges to reflect changing societal standards?) But at\nleast at the start, the Court insisted that these “evolving\nstandards” represented something other than the personal\nviews of five Justices. See Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S.\n263, 275 (1980) (explaining that “the Court’s Eighth\nAmendment judgments should neither be nor appear to\nbe merely the subjective views of individual Justices”). In­\nstead, the Court looked for objective indicia of our society’s\nmoral standards and the trajectory of our moral “evolu­\ntion.” See id., at 274–275 (emphasizing that “ ‘judgment\nshould be informed by objective factors to the maximum\npossible extent’ ” (quoting Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584,\n592 (1977) (plurality opinion))).\n   In this search for objective indicia, the Court toyed with\nthe use of public opinion polls, see Atkins, supra, at 316,\nn. 21, and occasionally relied on foreign law, see Roper v.\nSimmons, supra, at 575; Enmund v.

S., at 596, n. 10 (plu­\nrality opinion).\n   In the main, however, the staple of this inquiry was the\ntallying of the positions taken by state legislatures. Thus,\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Id., at 595–596. In Enmund, where the\nCourt held that the Eighth Amendment forbids capital\npunishment for ordinary felony murder, both federal law\nand the law of 28 of the 36 States that authorized the\ndeath penalty at the time rejected that punishment. 458\nU. S., at 789.\n   While the tally in these early cases may be character­\nized as evidence of a national consensus, the evidence\nbecame weaker and weaker in later cases. In Atkins,\nwhich held that low-IQ defendants may not be sentenced\nto death, the Court found an anti–death-penalty consen­\nsus even though more than half of the States that allowed\ncapital punishment permitted the practice. See 536 U. S.,\nat 342 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (observing that less than\nhalf of the 38 States that permit capital punishment\nhave enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally\nretarded). The Court attempted to get around this prob­\nlem by noting that there was a pronounced trend against\nthis punishment. See id., at 313–315 (listing 18 States\nthat had amended their laws since 1986 to prohibit the\nexecution of mentally retarded persons).\n   The importance of trend evidence, however, was not\nlong lived. In Roper, which outlawed capital punishment\nfor defendants between the ages of 16 and 18, the lineup of\nthe States was the same as in Atkins, but the trend in\nfavor of abolition—five States during the past 15 years—\nwas less impressive. Roper, 543 U. S., at 564–565. Never­\ntheless, the Court held that the absence of a strong trend\nin support of abolition did not matter. See id., at 566\n(“Any difference between this case and Atkins with respect\nto the pace of abolition is thus counterbalanced by the\nconsistent direction of the change”).\n   In Kennedy v. Louisiana, the Court went further. Hold­\n4                     MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ning that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punish­\nment for the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl, the Court\ndisregarded a nascent legislative trend in favor of permit-\nting capital punishment for this narrowly defined and\nheinous crime. See 554 U. S., at 433 (explaining that,\nalthough “the total number of States to have made child\nrape a capital offense . . . is six,” “[t]his is not an indication\nof a trend or change in direction comparable to the one\nsupported by data in Roper”). The Court felt no need to\nsee whether this trend developed further—perhaps be­\ncause true moral evolution can lead in only one direction.\nAnd despite the argument that the rape of a young child\nmay involve greater depravity than some murders, the\nCourt proclaimed that homicide is categorically different\nfrom all (or maybe almost all) other offenses. See id.,\nat 438 (stating that nonhomicide crimes, including child\nrape, “may be devastating in their harm . . . but in terms\nof moral depravity and of the injury to the person and\nto the public, they cannot be compared to murder in their\nseverity and irrevocability” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)). As the Court had previously put\nit, “death is different.” Ford, supra, at 411 (plurality\nopinion).\n   Two years after Kennedy, in Graham v. Florida, any\npretense of heeding a legislative consensus was discarded.\nIn Graham, federal law and the law of 37 States and the\nDistrict of Columbia permitted a minor to be sentenced to\nlife imprisonment without parole for nonhomicide crimes,\nbut despite this unmistakable evidence of a national con­\nsensus, the Court held that the practice violates the\nEighth Amendment. See 560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 1–3). The Court, however, drew a\ndistinction between minors who murder and minors who\ncommit other heinous offenses, so at least in that sense\nthe principle that death is different lived on.\n   Today, that principle is entirely put to rest, for here we\n                     Cite as: 567 U.

The two (carefully selected)\ncases before us concern very young defendants, and de­\nspite the brutality and evident depravity exhibited by at\nleast one of the petitioners, it is hard not to feel sympathy\nfor a 14-year-old sentenced to life without the possibility of\nrelease. But no one should be confused by the particulars\nof the two cases before us. The category of murderers that\nthe Court delicately calls “children” (murderers under the\nage of 18) consists overwhelmingly of young men who are\nfast approaching the legal age of adulthood. Evan Miller\nand Kuntrell Jackson are anomalies; much more typical\nare murderers like Christopher Simmons, who committed\na brutal thrill-killing just seven months shy of his 18th\nbirthday. Roper, 543 U. S., at 556.\n   Seventeen-year-olds commit a significant number of\nmurders every year,1 and some of these crimes are incred­\nibly brutal. Many of these murderers are at least as ma­\nture as the average 18-year-old. See Thompson, 487 U. S.,\nat 854 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that\nmaturity may “vary widely among different individuals of\nthe same age”). Congress and the legislatures of 43 States\nhave concluded that at least some of these murderers\nshould be sentenced to prison without parole, and 28\nStates and the Federal Government have decided that for\nsome of these offenders life without parole should be man­\ndatory. See Ante, at 20–21, and nn. 9–10. The majority of\nthis Court now overrules these legislative judgments.2\n——————\n  1 Between  2002 and 2010, 17-year-olds committed an average com­\nbined total of 424 murders and nonnegligent homicides per year. See\nDept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, §4, Arrests, Age of per­\nsons arrested (Table 4.7).\n  2 As the Court noted in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366\n\n(1989), Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 to eliminate\ndiscretionary sentencing and parole because it concluded that these\npractices had led to gross abuses. The Senate Report for the 1984 bill\n6                       MILLER v. ALABAMA\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  It is true that, at least for now, the Court apparently\npermits a trial judge to make an individualized decision\nthat a particular minor convicted of murder should be\nsentenced to life without parole, but do not expect this\npossibility to last very long. The majority goes out of its\nway to express the view that the imposition of a sentence\nof life without parole on a “child” (i.e., a murderer under\nthe age of 18) should be uncommon. Having held in Gra-\nham that a trial judge with discretionary sentencing\nauthority may not impose a sentence of life without parole\non a minor who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the\nJustices in the majority may soon extend that holding to\nminors who commit murder. We will see.\n  What today’s decision shows is that our Eighth Amend­\nment cases are no longer tied to any objective indicia of\nsociety’s standards. Our Eighth Amendment case law is\nnow entirely inward looking. After entirely disregarding\nobjective indicia of our society’s standards in Graham, the\nCourt now extrapolates from Graham. Future cases may\nextrapolate from today’s holding, and this process may\ncontinue until the majority brings sentencing practices\ninto line with whatever the majority views as truly\nevolved standards of decency.\n  The Eighth Amendment imposes certain limits on the\n——————\nrejected what it called the “outmoded rehabilitation model” for federal\ncriminal sentencing. S. Rep. No. 98–225, p. 38 (1983). According to\nthe Report, “almost everyone involved in the criminal justice system now\ndoubts that rehabilitation can be induced reliably in a prison setting,\nand it is now quite certain that no one can really detect whether or\nwhen a prisoner is rehabilitated.” Ibid. The Report also “observed that\nthe indeterminate-sentencing system had two ‘unjustifi[ed] and ‘shame­\nful’ consequences. The first was the great variation among sentences\nimposed by different judges upon similarly situated offenders. The\nsecond was uncertainty as to the time the offender would spend in\nprison. Each was a serious impediment to an evenhanded and effective\noperation of the criminal justice system.” Mistretta, supra, at 366\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 98–225, at 38, 65 (citation omitted)).\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

Determining the length of imprison­\nment that is appropriate for a particular offense and a\nparticular offender inevitably involves a balancing of in­\nterests. If imprisonment does nothing else, it removes\nthe criminal from the general population and prevents\nhim from committing additional crimes in the outside\nworld. When a legislature prescribes that a category of\nkillers must be sentenced to life imprisonment, the legisla­\nture, which presumably reflects the views of the elec­\ntorate, is taking the position that the risk that these\noffenders will kill again outweighs any countervailing\nconsideration, including reduced culpability due to imma­\nturity or the possibility of rehabilitation. When the major­\nity of this Court countermands that democratic decision,\nwhat the majority is saying is that members of society\nmust be exposed to the risk that these convicted murder­\ners, if released from custody, will murder again.\n   Unless our cases change course, we will continue to\nmarch toward some vision of evolutionary culmination\nthat the Court has not yet disclosed.
