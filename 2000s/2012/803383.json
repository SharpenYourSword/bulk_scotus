Decided June 29, 2012\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring in the denial of\ncertiorari.\n  During the finale of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime\nshow, entertainers Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson\nperformed a song and dance routine to Timberlake’s song\n“Rock Your Body.” As Timberlake ended the duet by sing-\ning “gonna have you naked by the end of this song,” he\ntore away a portion of Jackson’s bustier, momentarily re-\nvealing her breast. The performers subsequently strained\nthe credulity of the public by terming the episode a “ward-\nrobe malfunction.”\n  The Federal Communications Commission issued an or-\nder fining CBS $550,000 for broadcasting the nudity. The\nagency explained that the incident violated the FCC pol-\nicy against broadcasting indecent material, such as nu-\ndity and expletives, during the hours when children are\nmost likely to watch television. The Third Circuit vacated\nthe order, finding that it violated the Administrative\nProcedure Act as “arbitrary and capricious” agency action.\nThe court held that the FCC’s order represented an unex-\nplained departure from the agency’s longstanding policy of\nexcusing the broadcast of fleeting moments of indecency.\n663 F. 3d 122 (2011).\n  I am not so sure.

Looking ahead, it makes no dif-\nference as a matter of administrative law whether the\nFCC’s fleeting expletive policy applies to allegedly fleeting\nimages, because the FCC no longer adheres to the fleeting\nexpletive policy.
