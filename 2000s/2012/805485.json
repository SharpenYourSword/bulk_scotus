Pub. Saf. Code\nAnn. \u00a72\u2013501 et seq. (Lexis 2011), authorizes law enforce-\nment officials to collect DNA samples from individuals\ncharged with but not yet convicted of certain crimes, mainly\nviolent crimes and first-degree burglary. In 2009, police\narrested Alonzo Jay King, Jr., for first-degree assault.\nWhen personnel at the booking facility collected his DNA,\nthey found it matched DNA evidence from a rape commit-\nted in 2003. Relying on the match, the State charged and\nsuccessfully convicted King of, among other things, first-\ndegree rape. A divided Maryland Court of Appeals over-\nturned King\u2019s conviction, holding the collection of his DNA\nviolated the Fourth Amendment because his expectation of\nprivacy outweighed the State\u2019s interests. 425 Md. 550, 42\nA. 3d 549 (2012). Maryland now applies for a stay of that\njudgment pending this Court\u2019s disposition of its petition\nfor a writ of certiorari.\n  To warrant that relief, Maryland must demonstrate (1)\n\u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that this Court will grant certi-\norari, (2) \u201ca fair prospect\u201d that the Court will then reverse\nthe decision below, and (3) \u201ca likelihood that irreparable\nharm [will] result from the denial of a stay.\u201d Conkright v.\n2                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion in Chambers\n\nFrommert, 556 U. S. 1401, 1402 (2009) (GINSBURG, J., in\nchambers) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   To begin, there is a reasonable probability this Court\nwill grant certiorari. Maryland\u2019s decision conflicts with\ndecisions of the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and\nNinth Circuits as well as the Virginia Supreme Court,\nwhich have upheld statutes similar to Maryland\u2019s DNA\nCollection Act. See United States v. Mitchell, 652 F. 3d\n387 (CA3 2011), cert. denied, 566 U. S. ___ (2012); Haskell\nv. Harris, 669 F. 3d 1049 (CA9 2012), reh\u2019g en banc granted,\n2012 WL 3038593 (July 25, 2012); Anderson v. Com-\nmonwealth, 274 Va. 469, 650 S. E. 2d 702 (2007), cert.\ndenied, 553 U. S. 1054 (2008); see also Mario W. v. Kaipio,\n2012 WL 2401343 (Ariz. 2012) (holding that seizure of a\njuvenile\u2019s buccal cells does not violate the Fourth Amend-\nment but that extracting a DNA profile before the juvenile\nis convicted does).\n   The split implicates an important feature of day-to-day\nlaw enforcement practice in approximately half the States\nand the Federal Government. Reply to Memorandum in\nOpposition 3; see 114 Stat. 2728, as amended, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a714135a(a)(1)(A) (authorizing the Attorney General to\n\u201ccollect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested,\nfacing charges, or convicted\u201d). Indeed, the decision below\nhas direct effects beyond Maryland: Because the DNA\nsamples Maryland collects may otherwise be eligible for\nthe FBI\u2019s national DNA database, the decision renders the\ndatabase less effective for other States and the Federal\nGovernment. These factors make it reasonably probable\nthat the Court will grant certiorari to resolve the split on\nthe question presented. In addition, given the considered\nanalysis of courts on the other side of the split, there is a\nfair prospect that this Court will reverse the decision\nbelow.\n   Finally, the decision below subjects Maryland to ongoing\nirreparable harm. \u201c[A]ny time a State is enjoined by a\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Orrin W. Fox Co., 434\nU. S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers).\nHere there is, in addition, an ongoing and concrete harm\nto Maryland\u2019s law enforcement and public safety interests.\nAccording to Maryland, from 2009\u2014the year Maryland\nbegan collecting samples from arrestees\u2014to 2011, \u201cmatches\nfrom arrestee swabs [from Maryland] have resulted\nin 58 criminal prosecutions.\u201d Application 16. Collecting\nDNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies pro-\nvides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and\nthereby helping to remove violent offenders from the\ngeneral population. Crimes for which DNA evidence is\nimplicated tend to be serious, and serious crimes cause\nserious injuries. That Maryland may not employ a duly-\nenacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes\nirreparable harm.\n   King responds that Maryland\u2019s eight-week delay in\napplying for a stay undermines its allegation of irrepara-\nble harm. In addition, he points out that of the 10,666\nsamples Maryland seized last year, only 4,327 of them\nwere eligible for entry into the federal database and only\n19 led to an arrest (of which fewer than half led to a con-\nviction). Memorandum in Opposition 11. These are sound\npoints. Nonetheless, in the absence of a stay, Maryland\nwould be disabled from employing a valuable law enforce-\nment tool for several months\u2014a tool used widely through-\nout the country and one that has been upheld by two\nCourts of Appeals and another state high court.\n   Accordingly, the judgment and mandate below are\nhereby stayed pending the disposition of the petition for a\nwrit of certiorari. Should the petition for a writ of certio-\nrari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In\nthe event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted,\nthe stay shall terminate upon the issuance of the mandate\n4                MARYLAND v.
