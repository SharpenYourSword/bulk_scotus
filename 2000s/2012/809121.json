JEFFERSON COUNTY \n\n              COMMISSION, ET AL. \n\nON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n      THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA\n            No. 11–1184. Decided September 25, 2012\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Plaintiffs in this case claim that West Virginia’s 2011\ncongressional redistricting plan violates the “one person,\none vote” principle that we have held to be embodied in\nArticle I, §2, of the United States Constitution. A three-\njudge District Court for the Southern District of West\nVirginia agreed, declaring the plan “null and void” and\nenjoining West Virginia’s Secretary of State from imple-\nmenting it. App. to Juris. Statement 4. The state defend-\nants appealed directly to this Court. See 28 U. S. C.\n§1253. Because the District Court misapplied the stand-\nard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v.\nDaggett, 462 U. S. 725 (1983), and failed to afford appro-\npriate deference to West Virginia’s reasonable exercise of\nits political judgment, we reverse.\n                          *    *   *\n  Article I, §2, of the United States Constitution requires\nthat Members of the House of Representatives “be ap-\nportioned among the several States . . . according to their\nrespective Numbers” and “chosen every second Year by the\nPeople of the several States.” In Wesberry v. Sanders, 376\nU. S. 1 (1964), we held that these commands require that\n“as nearly as is practicable one man’s vote in a congres-\nsional election is to be worth as much as another’s.” Id., at\n7–8. We have since explained that the “as nearly as is\npracticable” standard does not require that congressional\n2      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndistricts be drawn with “precise mathematical equality,”\nbut instead that the State justify population differences\nbetween districts that could have been avoided by “a good-\nfaith effort to achieve absolute equality.” Karcher, supra,\nat 730 (quoting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526, 530–\n531 (1969); internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Karcher set out a two-prong test to determine whether a\nState’s congressional redistricting plan meets this stand-\nard. First, the parties challenging the plan bear the bur-\nden of proving the existence of population differences that\n“could practicably be avoided.” 462 U. S., at 734. If they\ndo so, the burden shifts to the State to “show with some\nspecificity” that the population differences “were necessary\nto achieve some legitimate state objective.” Id., at 741,\n740. This burden is a “flexible” one, which “depend[s] on\nthe size of the deviations, the importance of the State’s\ninterests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole\nreflects those interests, and the availability of alterna-\ntives that might substantially vindicate those interests\nyet approximate population equality more closely.” Id., at\n741. As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting “ordinarily\ninvolves criteria and standards that have been weighed\nand evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of\ntheir political judgment.” Perry v. Perez, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4). “[W]e are willing to\ndefer to [such] state legislative policies, so long as they are\nconsistent with constitutional norms, even if they require\nsmall differences in the population of congressional dis-\ntricts.” Karcher, supra, at 740.\n   In this case, plaintiffs claim that West Virginia’s redis-\ntricting plan, adopted following the 2010 decennial United\nStates census, violates Article I, §2, of the United States\nConstitution and, separately, the West Virginia Constitu-\ntion. The 2010 census did not alter West Virginia’s alloca-\ntion of three congressional seats. But due to popula-\ntion shifts within the State, West Virginia nonetheless\n                 Cite as: 567 U.

The com-\nmittee first considered a redistricting plan championed by\nits chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed “the\nPerfect Plan” because it achieved a population difference\nof a single person between the largest and smallest dis-\ntricts. That appears, however, to have been the only\nperfect aspect of the Perfect Plan. State legislators ex-\npressed concern that the plan contravened the State’s\nlongstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two\nincumbents’ residences in the same district, and moved\none-third of the State’s population from one district to\nanother.\n   The following day, members of the Redistricting Com-\nmittee introduced seven additional plans. The committee\neventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal,\nreferred to as S. B. 1008. The full Senate rejected a ninth\nproposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted\nS. B. 1008 by a vote of 27 to 4. The House of Delegates\napproved the bill without debate by a vote of 90 to 5.\nGovernor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August\n18, 2011.\n   S. B. 1008, codified at W. Va. Code Ann. §1–2–3 (Lexis\n2012 Supp.), does not split county lines, redistrict incum-\nbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts\nin the population of the current districts. Indeed, S. B.\n1008’s chief selling point was that it required very little\nchange to the existing districts: It moved just one county,\nrepresenting 1.5% of the State’s population, from one\ndistrict to another. This was the smallest shift of any plan\nconsidered by the legislature. S. B. 1008, however, has a\npopulation variance of 0.79%, the second highest variance\nof the plans the legislature considered. That is, the popu-\n4      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nlation difference between the largest and smallest districts\nin S. B. 1008 equals 0.79% of the population of the average\ndistrict.\n   The Jefferson County Commission and two of its county\ncommissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing\nS. B. 1008. At trial, the State conceded that it could have\nadopted a plan with lower population variations. The\nState argued, however, that legitimate state policies justi-\nfied the slightly higher variances in S. B. 1008, citing\nthis Court’s statement from Karcher that “[a]ny number\nof consistently applied legislative policies might justify\nsome variance, including, for instance, making districts com-\npact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the\ncores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between\nincumbent Representatives.” 462 U. S., at 740. The State\nnoted Karcher’s approving reference to a District Court\nopinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting\nplan with a population variance of 0.78%—virtually iden-\ntical to the variance in S. B. 1008. See id., at 740–741\n(citing West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1795880\"><a href=\"/wvsd/acRs/west-virginia-civil-liberties-union-v-rockefeller/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Va. 1972)).\n   The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction,\nholding that the State’s asserted objectives did not justify\nthe population variance. With respect to the objective of\nnot splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged\nthat West Virginia had never in its history divided a\ncounty between two or more congressional districts. The\ncourt speculated, however, that the practice of other States\ndividing counties between districts “may portend the\neventual deletion” of respecting such boundaries as a\npotentially legitimate justification for population vari-\nances. App. to Juris. Statement 15, n. 6. The court also\nfaulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing “to create\na contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B.\n1008’s entire 4,871-person variance—or even a discrete,\nnumerically precise portion thereof—was attributable” to\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Id., at 15, 16.\n   The court further questioned the State’s assertion that\nS. B. 1008 best preserved the core of existing districts.\nPreserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, in-\nvolved respecting the “ ‘[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and\neconomic interests common to the population of the area,’ ”\nid., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1286 (Kan. 2002)), not a “dogged insistence that\nchange be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi-\nzenry,” App. to Juris. Statement 20. The District Court\nconcluded that although acclimating to a new congressional\ndistrict and Congressperson “may give rise to a modicum\nof anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discom-\nfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized\nin Karcher as capable of legitimizing a variance.” Ibid.\n   With respect to preventing contests between incum-\nbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for\nfailing to build a record “linking all or a specific part of\nthe variance” to that asserted interest. Id., at 22. And the\nDistrict Court found that although 0.79% was a minor\nvariation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of\nachieving smaller variances due to improved technology\nmeant that the same variance must now be considered\nmajor. Because the District Court concluded that the\nredistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article I, §2,\nit did not reach plaintiffs’ challenges under the West\nVirginia Constitution.\n   Chief Judge Bailey dissented. He argued that the rec-\nord demonstrated the legitimacy of the State’s concerns,\nand that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well\nas S. B. 1008. He also took issue with the majority’s dis-\nregard for Karcher’s characterization of 0.78% as an ac-\nceptable disparity. App. to Juris. Statement 39.\n   We stayed the District Court’s order pending appeal to\n6      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthis Court, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.\n   Given the State’s concession that it could achieve smaller\npopulation variations, the remaining question under Kar-\ncher is whether the State can demonstrate that “the\npopulation deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve\nsome legitimate state objective.” 462 U. S., at 740. Con-\nsidering, as Karcher instructs, “the size of the deviations,\nthe importance of the State’s interests, the consistency\nwith which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,\nand the availability of alternatives that might substan-\ntially vindicate those interests,” id., at 741, it is clear\nthat West Virginia has carried its burden.\n   As an initial matter, the District Court erred in conclud-\ning that improved technology has converted a “minor”\nvariation in Karcher into a “major” variation today. Noth-\ning about technological advances in redistricting and\nmapping software has, for example, decreased population\nvariations between a State’s counties. See id., at 733, n. 5.\nThus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will\ninevitably have population variations between districts\nreflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un-\nevenly populated counties. Despite technological advances,\na variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilu-\ntion today than in 1983, when this Court said that such\na minor harm could be justified by legitimate state\nobjectives.\n   Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding\ncontests between incumbents and not splitting political\nsubdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.\nSee, e.g., id., at 740. The majority cited no precedent for\nrequiring legislative findings on the “discrete, numerically\nprecise portion” of the variance attributable to each factor,\nand we are aware of none.\n   The District Court dismissed the State’s interest in\nlimiting the shift of population between old and new dis-\ntricts as “ham-handed,” id., at 19, because the State con-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nsidered only “discrete bounds of geography,” rather than\n“ ‘[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests\ncommon to the population of the area.’ ” Id., at 17 (quoting\nGraham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286). According to the\nDistrict Court, that did not qualify as “preserving the\ncores of prior districts” under Karcher, 462 U. S., at 740–\n741.\n    Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher,\nhowever, our opinion made clear that its list of possible\njustifications for population variations was not exclusive.\nSee id., at 740 (“Any number of consistently applied legis-\nlative policies might justify some variance, including, for\ninstance, . . .”). The desire to minimize population shifts\nbetween districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1907912\"><a href=\"/ared/aMa3/turner-v-state-of-ark/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts\nthan the alternative plans—more than four times lower\nthan the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower\nthan others.\n    None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating\nall three of the State’s legitimate objectives while achiev-\ning a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at\nleast one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were\nworse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan\nfailed as to all three of the State’s objectives. See App. to\nJuris. Statement 43–45. This is not to say that anytime\na State must choose between serving an additional le-\ngitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may\nchoose the former. But here, given the small “size of the\ndeviations,” as balanced against “the importance of the\nState’s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a\nwhole reflects those interests,” and the lack of available\n“alternatives that might substantially vindicate those in-\nterests yet approximate population equality more closely,”\nKarcher, supra, at 741, S. B. 1008 is justified by the\n8      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nState’s legitimate objectives.\n  Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs’\nclaims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue\nhas not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the\nDistrict Court to address the remaining claims in the first\ninstance. The judgment of the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 809121, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/09/25/tennant_v._jefferson_county.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                  Cite as: 567 U.

He argued that the rec-\nord demonstrated the legitimacy of the State’s concerns,\nand that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well\nas S. B. 1008. He also took issue with the majority’s dis-\nregard for Karcher’s characterization of 0.78% as an ac-\nceptable disparity. App. to Juris. Statement 39.\n   We stayed the District Court’s order pending appeal to\n6      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthis Court, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.\n   Given the State’s concession that it could achieve smaller\npopulation variations, the remaining question under Kar-\ncher is whether the State can demonstrate that “the\npopulation deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve\nsome legitimate state objective.” 462 U. S., at 740. Con-\nsidering, as Karcher instructs, “the size of the deviations,\nthe importance of the State’s interests, the consistency\nwith which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,\nand the availability of alternatives that might substan-\ntially vindicate those interests,” id., at 741, it is clear\nthat West Virginia has carried its burden.\n   As an initial matter, the District Court erred in conclud-\ning that improved technology has converted a “minor”\nvariation in Karcher into a “major” variation today. Noth-\ning about technological advances in redistricting and\nmapping software has, for example, decreased population\nvariations between a State’s counties. See id., at 733, n. 5.\nThus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will\ninevitably have population variations between districts\nreflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un-\nevenly populated counties. Despite technological advances,\na variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilu-\ntion today than in 1983, when this Court said that such\na minor harm could be justified by legitimate state\nobjectives.\n   Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding\ncontests between incumbents and not splitting political\nsubdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.\nSee, e.g., id., at 740. The majority cited no precedent for\nrequiring legislative findings on the “discrete, numerically\nprecise portion” of the variance attributable to each factor,\nand we are aware of none.\n   The District Court dismissed the State’s interest in\nlimiting the shift of population between old and new dis-\ntricts as “ham-handed,” id., at 19, because the State con-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nsidered only “discrete bounds of geography,” rather than\n“ ‘[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests\ncommon to the population of the area.’ ” Id., at 17 (quoting\nGraham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286). According to the\nDistrict Court, that did not qualify as “preserving the\ncores of prior districts” under Karcher, 462 U. S., at 740–\n741.\n    Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher,\nhowever, our opinion made clear that its list of possible\njustifications for population variations was not exclusive.\nSee id., at 740 (“Any number of consistently applied legis-\nlative policies might justify some variance, including, for\ninstance, . . .”). The desire to minimize population shifts\nbetween districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, 784 F. Supp. 585, 588–589\n(ED Ark. 1991), summarily aff ’d, 504 U. S. 952 (1992).\nS. B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts\nthan the alternative plans—more than four times lower\nthan the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower\nthan others.\n    None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating\nall three of the State’s legitimate objectives while achiev-\ning a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at\nleast one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were\nworse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan\nfailed as to all three of the State’s objectives. See App. to\nJuris. Statement 43–45. This is not to say that anytime\na State must choose between serving an additional le-\ngitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may\nchoose the former. But here, given the small “size of the\ndeviations,” as balanced against “the importance of the\nState’s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a\nwhole reflects those interests,” and the lack of available\n“alternatives that might substantially vindicate those in-\nterests yet approximate population equality more closely,”\nKarcher, supra, at 741, S. B. 1008 is justified by the\n8      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nState’s legitimate objectives.\n  Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs’\nclaims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue\nhas not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the\nDistrict Court to address the remaining claims in the first\ninstance. The judgment of the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/809121/", "sha1": "9911710eeeb80b28c490f8092c1f958bfb96f31f", "source": "C", "time_retrieved": "2012-09-25T07:02:16"}
