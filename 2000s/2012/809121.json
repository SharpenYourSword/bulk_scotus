Decided September 25, 2012\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Plaintiffs in this case claim that West Virginia\u2019s 2011\ncongressional redistricting plan violates the \u201cone person,\none vote\u201d principle that we have held to be embodied in\nArticle I, \u00a72, of the United States Constitution. A three-\njudge District Court for the Southern District of West\nVirginia agreed, declaring the plan \u201cnull and void\u201d and\nenjoining West Virginia\u2019s Secretary of State from imple-\nmenting it. App. to Juris. Statement 4. The state defend-\nants appealed directly to this Court. See 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71253. Because the District Court misapplied the stand-\nard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher v.\nDaggett, 462 U. S. 725 (1983), and failed to afford appro-\npriate deference to West Virginia\u2019s reasonable exercise of\nits political judgment, we reverse.\n                          *    *   *\n  Article I, \u00a72, of the United States Constitution requires\nthat Members of the House of Representatives \u201cbe ap-\nportioned among the several States . . . according to their\nrespective Numbers\u201d and \u201cchosen every second Year by the\nPeople of the several States.\u201d In Wesberry v. Sanders, 376\nU. S. 1 (1964), we held that these commands require that\n\u201cas nearly as is practicable one man\u2019s vote in a congres-\nsional election is to be worth as much as another\u2019s.\u201d Id., at\n7\u20138. We have since explained that the \u201cas nearly as is\npracticable\u201d standard does not require that congressional\n2      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\ndistricts be drawn with \u201cprecise mathematical equality,\u201d\nbut instead that the State justify population differences\nbetween districts that could have been avoided by \u201ca good-\nfaith effort to achieve absolute equality.\u201d Karcher, supra,\nat 730 (quoting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U. S. 526, 530\u2013\n531 (1969); internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Karcher set out a two-prong test to determine whether a\nState\u2019s congressional redistricting plan meets this stand-\nard. First, the parties challenging the plan bear the bur-\nden of proving the existence of population differences that\n\u201ccould practicably be avoided.\u201d 462 U. S., at 734. If they\ndo so, the burden shifts to the State to \u201cshow with some\nspecificity\u201d that the population differences \u201cwere necessary\nto achieve some legitimate state objective.\u201d Id., at 741,\n740. This burden is a \u201cflexible\u201d one, which \u201cdepend[s] on\nthe size of the deviations, the importance of the State\u2019s\ninterests, the consistency with which the plan as a whole\nreflects those interests, and the availability of alterna-\ntives that might substantially vindicate those interests\nyet approximate population equality more closely.\u201d Id., at\n741. As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting \u201cordinarily\ninvolves criteria and standards that have been weighed\nand evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of\ntheir political judgment.\u201d Perry v. Perez, 565 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4). \u201c[W]e are willing to\ndefer to [such] state legislative policies, so long as they are\nconsistent with constitutional norms, even if they require\nsmall differences in the population of congressional dis-\ntricts.\u201d Karcher, supra, at 740.\n   In this case, plaintiffs claim that West Virginia\u2019s redis-\ntricting plan, adopted following the 2010 decennial United\nStates census, violates Article I, \u00a72, of the United States\nConstitution and, separately, the West Virginia Constitu-\ntion. The 2010 census did not alter West Virginia\u2019s alloca-\ntion of three congressional seats. But due to popula-\ntion shifts within the State, West Virginia nonetheless\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nbegan redistricting to comply with the requirements in our\nprecedents.\n   In August 2011, the West Virginia Legislature convened\nan extraordinary session, and the State Senate formed a\n17-member Select Committee on Redistricting. The com-\nmittee first considered a redistricting plan championed by\nits chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed \u201cthe\nPerfect Plan\u201d because it achieved a population difference\nof a single person between the largest and smallest dis-\ntricts. That appears, however, to have been the only\nperfect aspect of the Perfect Plan. State legislators ex-\npressed concern that the plan contravened the State\u2019s\nlongstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two\nincumbents\u2019 residences in the same district, and moved\none-third of the State\u2019s population from one district to\nanother.\n   The following day, members of the Redistricting Com-\nmittee introduced seven additional plans. The committee\neventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal,\nreferred to as S. B. 1008. The full Senate rejected a ninth\nproposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted\nS. B. 1008 by a vote of 27 to 4. The House of Delegates\napproved the bill without debate by a vote of 90 to 5.\nGovernor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August\n18, 2011.\n   S. B. 1008, codified at W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a71\u20132\u20133 (Lexis\n2012 Supp.), does not split county lines, redistrict incum-\nbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts\nin the population of the current districts. Indeed, S. B.\n1008\u2019s chief selling point was that it required very little\nchange to the existing districts: It moved just one county,\nrepresenting 1.5% of the State\u2019s population, from one\ndistrict to another. This was the smallest shift of any plan\nconsidered by the legislature. S. B. 1008, however, has a\npopulation variance of 0.79%, the second highest variance\nof the plans the legislature considered. That is, the popu-\n4      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nlation difference between the largest and smallest districts\nin S. B. 1008 equals 0.79% of the population of the average\ndistrict.\n   The Jefferson County Commission and two of its county\ncommissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing\nS. B. 1008. At trial, the State conceded that it could have\nadopted a plan with lower population variations. The\nState argued, however, that legitimate state policies justi-\nfied the slightly higher variances in S. B. 1008, citing\nthis Court\u2019s statement from Karcher that \u201c[a]ny number\nof consistently applied legislative policies might justify\nsome variance, including, for instance, making districts com-\npact, respecting municipal boundaries, preserving the\ncores of prior districts, and avoiding contests between\nincumbent Representatives.\u201d 462 U. S., at 740. The State\nnoted Karcher\u2019s approving reference to a District Court\nopinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting\nplan with a population variance of 0.78%\u2014virtually iden-\ntical to the variance in S. B. 1008. See id., at 740\u2013741\n(citing West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller,\n336 F. Supp. 395 (SD W. Va. 1972)).\n   The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction,\nholding that the State\u2019s asserted objectives did not justify\nthe population variance. With respect to the objective of\nnot splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged\nthat West Virginia had never in its history divided a\ncounty between two or more congressional districts. The\ncourt speculated, however, that the practice of other States\ndividing counties between districts \u201cmay portend the\neventual deletion\u201d of respecting such boundaries as a\npotentially legitimate justification for population vari-\nances. App. to Juris. Statement 15, n. 6. The court also\nfaulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing \u201cto create\na contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B.\n1008\u2019s entire 4,871-person variance\u2014or even a discrete,\nnumerically precise portion thereof\u2014was attributable\u201d to\n                  Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nthe State\u2019s interest in respecting county boundaries and\nnoted that several other plans under consideration also\ndid not split counties. Id., at 15, 16.\n   The court further questioned the State\u2019s assertion that\nS. B. 1008 best preserved the core of existing districts.\nPreserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, in-\nvolved respecting the \u201c \u2018[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and\neconomic interests common to the population of the area,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, 207 F. Supp. 2d\n1280, 1286 (Kan. 2002)), not a \u201cdogged insistence that\nchange be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi-\nzenry,\u201d App. to Juris. Statement 20. The District Court\nconcluded that although acclimating to a new congressional\ndistrict and Congressperson \u201cmay give rise to a modicum\nof anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discom-\nfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized\nin Karcher as capable of legitimizing a variance.\u201d Ibid.\n   With respect to preventing contests between incum-\nbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for\nfailing to build a record \u201clinking all or a specific part of\nthe variance\u201d to that asserted interest. Id., at 22. And the\nDistrict Court found that although 0.79% was a minor\nvariation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of\nachieving smaller variances due to improved technology\nmeant that the same variance must now be considered\nmajor. Because the District Court concluded that the\nredistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article I, \u00a72,\nit did not reach plaintiffs\u2019 challenges under the West\nVirginia Constitution.\n   Chief Judge Bailey dissented. He argued that the rec-\nord demonstrated the legitimacy of the State\u2019s concerns,\nand that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well\nas S. B. 1008. He also took issue with the majority\u2019s dis-\nregard for Karcher\u2019s characterization of 0.78% as an ac-\nceptable disparity. App. to Juris. Statement 39.\n   We stayed the District Court\u2019s order pending appeal to\n6      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthis Court, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.\n   Given the State\u2019s concession that it could achieve smaller\npopulation variations, the remaining question under Kar-\ncher is whether the State can demonstrate that \u201cthe\npopulation deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve\nsome legitimate state objective.\u201d 462 U. S., at 740. Con-\nsidering, as Karcher instructs, \u201cthe size of the deviations,\nthe importance of the State\u2019s interests, the consistency\nwith which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,\nand the availability of alternatives that might substan-\ntially vindicate those interests,\u201d id., at 741, it is clear\nthat West Virginia has carried its burden.\n   As an initial matter, the District Court erred in conclud-\ning that improved technology has converted a \u201cminor\u201d\nvariation in Karcher into a \u201cmajor\u201d variation today. Noth-\ning about technological advances in redistricting and\nmapping software has, for example, decreased population\nvariations between a State\u2019s counties. See id., at 733, n. 5.\nThus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will\ninevitably have population variations between districts\nreflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un-\nevenly populated counties. Despite technological advances,\na variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilu-\ntion today than in 1983, when this Court said that such\na minor harm could be justified by legitimate state\nobjectives.\n   Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding\ncontests between incumbents and not splitting political\nsubdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.\nSee, e.g., id., at 740. The majority cited no precedent for\nrequiring legislative findings on the \u201cdiscrete, numerically\nprecise portion\u201d of the variance attributable to each factor,\nand we are aware of none.\n   The District Court dismissed the State\u2019s interest in\nlimiting the shift of population between old and new dis-\ntricts as \u201cham-handed,\u201d id., at 19, because the State con-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nsidered only \u201cdiscrete bounds of geography,\u201d rather than\n\u201c \u2018[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests\ncommon to the population of the area.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 17 (quoting\nGraham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286). According to the\nDistrict Court, that did not qualify as \u201cpreserving the\ncores of prior districts\u201d under Karcher, 462 U. S., at 740\u2013\n741.\n    Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher,\nhowever, our opinion made clear that its list of possible\njustifications for population variations was not exclusive.\nSee id., at 740 (\u201cAny number of consistently applied legis-\nlative policies might justify some variance, including, for\ninstance, . . .\u201d). The desire to minimize population shifts\nbetween districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, 784 F. Supp. 585, 588\u2013589\n(ED Ark. 1991), summarily aff \u2019d, 504 U. S. 952 (1992).\nS. B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts\nthan the alternative plans\u2014more than four times lower\nthan the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower\nthan others.\n    None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating\nall three of the State\u2019s legitimate objectives while achiev-\ning a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at\nleast one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were\nworse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan\nfailed as to all three of the State\u2019s objectives. See App. to\nJuris. Statement 43\u201345. This is not to say that anytime\na State must choose between serving an additional le-\ngitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may\nchoose the former. But here, given the small \u201csize of the\ndeviations,\u201d as balanced against \u201cthe importance of the\nState\u2019s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a\nwhole reflects those interests,\u201d and the lack of available\n\u201calternatives that might substantially vindicate those in-\nterests yet approximate population equality more closely,\u201d\nKarcher, supra, at 741, S. B. 1008 is justified by the\n8      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nState\u2019s legitimate objectives.\n  Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue\nhas not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the\nDistrict Court to address the remaining claims in the first\ninstance. The judgment of the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n",

The State\nnoted Karcher\u2019s approving reference to a District Court\nopinion upholding a previous West Virginia redistricting\nplan with a population variance of 0.78%\u2014virtually iden-\ntical to the variance in S. B. 1008. See id., at 740\u2013741\n(citing West Virginia Civil Liberties Union v. Rockefeller,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1795880\"><a href=\"/wvsd/acRs/west-virginia-civil-liberties-union-v-rockefeller/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Va. 1972)).\n   The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction,\nholding that the State\u2019s asserted objectives did not justify\nthe population variance. With respect to the objective of\nnot splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged\nthat West Virginia had never in its history divided a\ncounty between two or more congressional districts. The\ncourt speculated, however, that the practice of other States\ndividing counties between districts \u201cmay portend the\neventual deletion\u201d of respecting such boundaries as a\npotentially legitimate justification for population vari-\nances. App. to Juris. Statement 15, n. 6. The court also\nfaulted the West Virginia Legislature for failing \u201cto create\na contemporaneous record sufficient to show that S. B.\n1008\u2019s entire 4,871-person variance\u2014or even a discrete,\nnumerically precise portion thereof\u2014was attributable\u201d to\n                  Cite as: 567 U.

Id., at 15, 16.\n   The court further questioned the State\u2019s assertion that\nS. B. 1008 best preserved the core of existing districts.\nPreserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, in-\nvolved respecting the \u201c \u2018[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and\neconomic interests common to the population of the area,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 17 (quoting Graham v. Thornburgh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1286 (Kan. 2002)), not a \u201cdogged insistence that\nchange be minimized for the benefit of the delicate citi-\nzenry,\u201d App. to Juris. Statement 20. The District Court\nconcluded that although acclimating to a new congressional\ndistrict and Congressperson \u201cmay give rise to a modicum\nof anxiety and inconvenience, avoiding constituent discom-\nfort at the margins is not among those policies recognized\nin Karcher as capable of legitimizing a variance.\u201d Ibid.\n   With respect to preventing contests between incum-\nbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for\nfailing to build a record \u201clinking all or a specific part of\nthe variance\u201d to that asserted interest. Id., at 22. And the\nDistrict Court found that although 0.79% was a minor\nvariation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of\nachieving smaller variances due to improved technology\nmeant that the same variance must now be considered\nmajor. Because the District Court concluded that the\nredistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article I, \u00a72,\nit did not reach plaintiffs\u2019 challenges under the West\nVirginia Constitution.\n   Chief Judge Bailey dissented. He argued that the rec-\nord demonstrated the legitimacy of the State\u2019s concerns,\nand that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well\nas S. B. 1008. He also took issue with the majority\u2019s dis-\nregard for Karcher\u2019s characterization of 0.78% as an ac-\nceptable disparity. App. to Juris. Statement 39.\n   We stayed the District Court\u2019s order pending appeal to\n6      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nthis Court, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), and now reverse.\n   Given the State\u2019s concession that it could achieve smaller\npopulation variations, the remaining question under Kar-\ncher is whether the State can demonstrate that \u201cthe\npopulation deviations in its plan were necessary to achieve\nsome legitimate state objective.\u201d 462 U. S., at 740. Con-\nsidering, as Karcher instructs, \u201cthe size of the deviations,\nthe importance of the State\u2019s interests, the consistency\nwith which the plan as a whole reflects those interests,\nand the availability of alternatives that might substan-\ntially vindicate those interests,\u201d id., at 741, it is clear\nthat West Virginia has carried its burden.\n   As an initial matter, the District Court erred in conclud-\ning that improved technology has converted a \u201cminor\u201d\nvariation in Karcher into a \u201cmajor\u201d variation today. Noth-\ning about technological advances in redistricting and\nmapping software has, for example, decreased population\nvariations between a State\u2019s counties. See id., at 733, n. 5.\nThus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will\ninevitably have population variations between districts\nreflecting the fact that its districts are composed of un-\nevenly populated counties. Despite technological advances,\na variance of 0.79% results in no more (or less) vote dilu-\ntion today than in 1983, when this Court said that such\na minor harm could be justified by legitimate state\nobjectives.\n   Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding\ncontests between incumbents and not splitting political\nsubdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies.\nSee, e.g., id., at 740. The majority cited no precedent for\nrequiring legislative findings on the \u201cdiscrete, numerically\nprecise portion\u201d of the variance attributable to each factor,\nand we are aware of none.\n   The District Court dismissed the State\u2019s interest in\nlimiting the shift of population between old and new dis-\ntricts as \u201cham-handed,\u201d id., at 19, because the State con-\n                 Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nsidered only \u201cdiscrete bounds of geography,\u201d rather than\n\u201c \u2018[s]ocial, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic interests\ncommon to the population of the area.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 17 (quoting\nGraham v. Thornburgh, supra, at 1286). According to the\nDistrict Court, that did not qualify as \u201cpreserving the\ncores of prior districts\u201d under Karcher, 462 U. S., at 740\u2013\n741.\n    Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher,\nhowever, our opinion made clear that its list of possible\njustifications for population variations was not exclusive.\nSee id., at 740 (\u201cAny number of consistently applied legis-\nlative policies might justify some variance, including, for\ninstance, . . .\u201d). The desire to minimize population shifts\nbetween districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy.\nSee, e.g., Turner v. Arkansas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1907912\"><a href=\"/ared/aMa3/turner-v-state-of-ark/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 588\u2013589\n(ED Ark. 1991), summarily aff \u2019d, 504 U. S. 952 (1992).\nS. B. 1008 achieves significantly lower population shifts\nthan the alternative plans\u2014more than four times lower\nthan the closest alternative, and more than 25 times lower\nthan others.\n    None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating\nall three of the State\u2019s legitimate objectives while achiev-\ning a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at\nleast one objective as well as S. B. 1008 does; several were\nworse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan\nfailed as to all three of the State\u2019s objectives. See App. to\nJuris. Statement 43\u201345. This is not to say that anytime\na State must choose between serving an additional le-\ngitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may\nchoose the former. But here, given the small \u201csize of the\ndeviations,\u201d as balanced against \u201cthe importance of the\nState\u2019s interests, the consistency with which the plan as a\nwhole reflects those interests,\u201d and the lack of available\n\u201calternatives that might substantially vindicate those in-\nterests yet approximate population equality more closely,\u201d\nKarcher, supra, at 741, S. B. 1008 is justified by the\n8      TENNANT v. JEFFERSON COUNTY COMMISSION\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nState\u2019s legitimate objectives.\n  Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims under the West Virginia Constitution and the issue\nhas not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the\nDistrict Court to address the remaining claims in the first\ninstance. The judgment of the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia is re-\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
