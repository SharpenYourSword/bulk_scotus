DAN WIDEMAN ET AL. \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 12\u2013168.   Decided November 5, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case concerns the award of attorney\u2019s fees in a suit\nalleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nheld that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction\nbut no monetary damages was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d\nunder 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, and so could not receive fees.\nThat was error. Because the injunction ordered the de-\nfendant officials to change their behavior in a way that\ndirectly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.\n                        *     *    *\n  Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia\nChristians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in\nwhich they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the\navailability of abortions. On November 3, 2005, Lefemine\nand about 20 other CCL members conducted such a\ndemonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood Coun-\nty, South Carolina. Citing complaints about the graphic\nsigns, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefem-\nine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be tick-\neted for breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting\nthat the officer was violating his First Amendment rights,\nbut the threat eventually caused him to disband the pro-\ntest. See Lefemine v. Davis, 732 F. Supp. 2d 614, 617\u2013619\n(SC 2010).\n  A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to\n2                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nDan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, inform-\ning him that the group intended to return to the same site\nwith the disputed signs. The letter cautioned that further\ninterference would cause Lefemine \u201c \u2018to pursue all avail-\nable legal remedies.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 619. Chief Deputy Mike\nFrederick responded that the police had not previously\nviolated Lefemine\u2019s rights, and warned that \u201c \u2018should we\nobserve any protester or demonstrator committing the\nsame act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the\nsame manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal\nsanctions.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. Out of fear of those sanctions, the group\nchose not to protest in the county for the next two years.\nSee ibid.\n   On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 against several Greenwood County\npolice officers alleging violations of his First Amendment\nrights. Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory\njudgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney\u2019s fees.\nSee 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 620. Ruling on the parties\u2019 dueling\nmotions for summary judgment, the District Court deter-\nmined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine\u2019s\nrights. See id., at 620\u2013625. The court therefore perma-\nnently enjoined the defendants \u201cfrom engaging in content-\nbased restrictions on [Lefemine\u2019s] display of graphic signs\u201d\nunder similar circumstances. Id., at 627. The court,\nhowever, refused Lefemine\u2019s request for nominal damages,\nfinding that the defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the illegality of their conduct was not\nclearly established at the time. See ibid. The court as\nwell denied Lefemine\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under\n\u00a71988, stating that \u201c[u]nder the totality of the facts in this\ncase the award of attorney\u2019s fees is not warranted.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney\u2019s fees\non the ground that the District Court\u2019s judgment did\nnot make Lefemine a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a71988. 672\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

No\nother damages were awarded.\u201d Ibid. Lefemine sought a\nwrit of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit\u2019s determina-\ntion that he was not a prevailing party under \u00a71988.\n   The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90\nStat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71988, allows \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d\nin certain civil rights actions, including suits brought\nunder \u00a71983, to recover \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d A\nplaintiff \u201cprevails,\u201d we have held, \u201cwhen actual relief on\nthe merits of his claim materially alters the legal relation-\nship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s\nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 111\u2013112 (1992). And we\nhave repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory\njudgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that\ntest. See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) (per\ncuriam).\n   Under these established standards, Lefemine was a\nprevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstra-\ntions in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant\npolice officers had told him he could not carry. He brought\nthis suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself\nfrom the defendants\u2019 standing threat of sanctions. And he\nsucceeded in removing that threat. The District Court\nheld that the defendants had violated Lefemine\u2019s rights\nand enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The defendants did not appeal the District Court\u2019s judgment that\nthey had violated Lefemine\u2019s First Amendment rights, so the Court of\nAppeals took as a given that a violation had occurred. See 672 F. 3d, at\n299, n. 5.\n4                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfuture. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s view, that ruling\nworked the requisite material alteration in the parties\u2019\nrelationship. Before the ruling, the police intended to stop\nLefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling,\nthe police could not prevent him from demonstrating\nin that manner. So when the District Court \u201cordered\n[d]efendants to comply with the law,\u201d 672 F. 3d, at 303,\nthe relief given\u2014as in the usual case involving such an\ninjunction\u2014supported the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\n   Because Lefemine is a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d he \u201cshould\nordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circum-\nstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither of the courts below addressed\nwhether any special circumstances exist in this case, and\nwe do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on\nwhich the police officers could contest liability for fees\nis not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for\ncertiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",
