Decided November 5, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  This case concerns the award of attorney’s fees in a suit\nalleging unconstitutional conduct by government officials.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nheld that a plaintiff who secured a permanent injunction\nbut no monetary damages was not a “prevailing party”\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1988, and so could not receive fees.\nThat was error. Because the injunction ordered the de-\nfendant officials to change their behavior in a way that\ndirectly benefited the plaintiff, we vacate the Fourth Cir-\ncuit’s decision and remand for further proceedings.\n                        *     *    *\n  Petitioner Steven Lefemine and members of Columbia\nChristians for Life (CCL) engage in demonstrations in\nwhich they carry pictures of aborted fetuses to protest the\navailability of abortions. On November 3, 2005, Lefemine\nand about 20 other CCL members conducted such a\ndemonstration at a busy intersection in Greenwood Coun-\nty, South Carolina. Citing complaints about the graphic\nsigns, a Greenwood County police officer informed Lefem-\nine that if the signs were not discarded, he would be tick-\neted for breach of the peace. Lefemine objected, asserting\nthat the officer was violating his First Amendment rights,\nbut the threat eventually caused him to disband the pro-\ntest. See Lefemine v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617–619\n(SC 2010).\n  A year later, an attorney for Lefemine sent a letter to\n2                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nDan Wideman, the sheriff of Greenwood County, inform-\ning him that the group intended to return to the same site\nwith the disputed signs. The letter cautioned that further\ninterference would cause Lefemine “ ‘to pursue all avail-\nable legal remedies.’ ” Id., at 619. Chief Deputy Mike\nFrederick responded that the police had not previously\nviolated Lefemine’s rights, and warned that “ ‘should we\nobserve any protester or demonstrator committing the\nsame act, we will again conduct ourselves in exactly the\nsame manner: order the person(s) to stop or face criminal\nsanctions.’ ” Ibid. Out of fear of those sanctions, the group\nchose not to protest in the county for the next two years.\nSee ibid.\n   On October 31, 2008, Lefemine filed a complaint under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 against several Greenwood County\npolice officers alleging violations of his First Amendment\nrights. Lefemine sought nominal damages, a declaratory\njudgment, a permanent injunction, and attorney’s fees.\nSee 732 F. Supp. 2d, at 620. Ruling on the parties’ dueling\nmotions for summary judgment, the District Court deter-\nmined that the defendants had infringed Lefemine’s\nrights. See id., at 620–625. The court therefore perma-\nnently enjoined the defendants “from engaging in content-\nbased restrictions on [Lefemine’s] display of graphic signs”\nunder similar circumstances. Id., at 627. The court,\nhowever, refused Lefemine’s request for nominal damages,\nfinding that the defendants were entitled to qualified\nimmunity because the illegality of their conduct was not\nclearly established at the time. See ibid. The court as\nwell denied Lefemine’s request for attorney’s fees under\n§1988, stating that “[u]nder the totality of the facts in this\ncase the award of attorney’s fees is not warranted.” Ibid.\n   The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of attorney’s fees\non the ground that the District Court’s judgment did\nnot make Lefemine a “prevailing party” under §1988. 672\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

No\nother damages were awarded.” Ibid. Lefemine sought a\nwrit of certiorari to review the Fourth Circuit’s determina-\ntion that he was not a prevailing party under §1988.\n   The Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90\nStat. 2641, 42 U. S. C. §1988, allows “the prevailing party”\nin certain civil rights actions, including suits brought\nunder §1983, to recover “a reasonable attorney’s fee.” A\nplaintiff “prevails,” we have held, “when actual relief on\nthe merits of his claim materially alters the legal relation-\nship between the parties by modifying the defendant’s\nbehavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.”\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103, 111–112 (1992). And we\nhave repeatedly held that an injunction or declaratory\njudgment, like a damages award, will usually satisfy that\ntest. See, e.g., Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U. S. 1, 4 (1988) (per\ncuriam).\n   Under these established standards, Lefemine was a\nprevailing party. Lefemine desired to conduct demonstra-\ntions in Greenwood County with signs that the defendant\npolice officers had told him he could not carry. He brought\nthis suit in part to secure an injunction to protect himself\nfrom the defendants’ standing threat of sanctions. And he\nsucceeded in removing that threat. The District Court\nheld that the defendants had violated Lefemine’s rights\nand enjoined them from engaging in similar conduct in the\n\n——————\n  * The defendants did not appeal the District Court’s judgment that\nthey had violated Lefemine’s First Amendment rights, so the Court of\nAppeals took as a given that a violation had occurred. See 672 F. 3d, at\n299, n. 5.\n4                  LEFEMINE v. WIDEMAN\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nfuture. Contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s view, that ruling\nworked the requisite material alteration in the parties’\nrelationship. Before the ruling, the police intended to stop\nLefemine from protesting with his signs; after the ruling,\nthe police could not prevent him from demonstrating\nin that manner. So when the District Court “ordered\n[d]efendants to comply with the law,” 672 F. 3d, at 303,\nthe relief given—as in the usual case involving such an\ninjunction—supported the award of attorney’s fees.\n   Because Lefemine is a “prevailing party,” he “should\nordinarily recover an attorney’s fee unless special circum-\nstances would render such an award unjust.” Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U. S. 424, 429 (1983) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Neither of the courts below addressed\nwhether any special circumstances exist in this case, and\nwe do not do so; whether there may be other grounds on\nwhich the police officers could contest liability for fees\nis not a question before us. Accordingly, the petition for\ncertiorari is granted, the judgment of the Fourth Circuit is\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 811228, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/11/05/lefemine_v._wideman.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 568 U.
