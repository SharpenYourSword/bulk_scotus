RICK THALER, DI- \n\n RECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUS- \n\n  TICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\n\n                 ON APPLICATION FOR STAY\n                     [November 13, 2012]\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS and\nJUSTICE ALITO join, dissenting from the grant of stay of\nexecution.\n   I dissent from the Court\u2019s order of October 18, 2012,\ngranting the application of Anthony Haynes for stay of\nexecution of sentence of death. Petitioner Haynes, who\nhad committed a series of armed robberies, was ap-\nproached by off-duty Houston Police Department Officer\nKent Kincaid after a bullet from Haynes\u2019s truck had\ncracked Kincaid\u2019s windshield. Kincaid, who thought the\nmissile had been a rock, identified himself as a police\nofficer and asked for Haynes\u2019s driving license. Haynes\nlifted a pistol and shot the officer in the head. Haynes was\napprehended and confessed to the killing. He was tried\nfor the capital murder of a peace officer \u201cacting in the law-\nful discharge of an official duty,\u201d Tex. Penal Code Ann.\n\u00a719.03(a)(1) (West Cum. Supp. 2012). A Texas jury found\nhim guilty and sentenced him to death.\n   It has been more than 14 years since Haynes killed\nOfficer Kincaid, 10 years since we denied Haynes\u2019s first\npetition for certiorari, see Haynes v. Texas, 535 U. S. 999\n(2002), and six months since we denied his second, see\nHaynes v. Thaler, 566 U. S. ___ (2012). Haynes is now\nback before us a third time, arguing that he received\nineffective assistance from his trial counsel and that his\n2                    HAYNES v. THALER\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nprocedural default of this claim is excused by our decision\nseven months ago in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. ___\n(2012), which he asserts entitles him to a reopening of his\nhabeas proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b)(6).\n   The Fifth Circuit determined that Haynes did not qual-\nify for relief under Martinez, which carved out a \u201climited\u201d\nexception to our longstanding rule that attorney error on\nstate collateral review does not constitute cause to excuse\nprocedural default of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\nclaim, see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991).\nAccording to the Fifth Circuit, Texas inmates fall outside\nthe scope of Martinez, which applies only \u201cwhere the State\nbarred the defendant from raising the claims on direct ap-\npeal,\u201d 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). See Ibarra v.\nThaler, 687 F. 3d 222, 225\u2013227 (2012). Haynes points to\nthe practical difficulties in Texas of successfully raising an\nineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal or by motion\nfor new trial.\n   Even if the Fifth Circuit is incorrect and Martinez does\nimplicate Texas\u2019s system of postconviction review, a stay is\nunwarranted here because Haynes presents no plausible\nclaim for relief. His complaint is that his trial counsel was\nineffective at sentencing. The absolute most to which he\nwould be entitled under Martinez is excuse of his proce-\ndural default of this claim, enabling a federal district court\nto adjudicate the claim on the merits. But that is precisely\nwhat the District Court already did on federal habeas\nreview. See Haynes v. Quarterman, Civ. No. H\u201305\u20133424,\n2007 WL 268374 (SD Tex., Jan. 25, 2007). In addition to\nfinding the majority of Haynes\u2019s ineffective-assistance\nclaims procedurally defaulted, the court rejected all of\nthem on the merits. It concluded that Haynes\u2019s argument\nwas \u201c \u2018not that counsel\u2019s performance should have been\nbetter, rather, his argument is that counsel should have\ninvestigated and presented evidence at the punishment\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nphase in a completely different manner.\u2019 \u201d Id., at *9. It\nrejected that argument because it concluded that his\nlawyers\u2019 decisions represented simply \u201cthe exercise of [a]\nstrategy\u201d different from what Haynes would now prefer.\nIbid. It said that even \u201c[i]f the constraints of federal re-\nview did not command that Haynes first give the state\ncourts an opportunity to adjudicate his claims of error,\nthis court would still not issue a habeas writ.\u201d Ibid. Thus,\nwhen the District Court denied Haynes\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6)\nmotion, it correctly concluded that Martinez (which would\ndo no more than excuse Haynes\u2019s procedural default) was\nbeside the point, since the court had \u201calready granted\nHaynes the relief he now requests: The court considered\nthe merits of his barred claims.\u201d Haynes v. Thaler, 2012\nWL 4739541, *5 (Oct. 3, 2012).\n   This stay cannot, therefore, be justified even as preserv-\ning an opportunity to challenge the sentence under Mar-\ntinez. And because I see no reason to believe that the\nDistrict Court was wrong about the merits of Haynes\u2019s\nclaims, I also do not consider a stay warranted in order to\nplumb the record and correct any alleged factbound error\nof the District Court.\n   Haynes has already outlived the policeman whom he\nshot in the head by 14 years. I cannot join the Court\u2019s\nfurther postponement of the State\u2019s execution of its lawful\njudgment.\n",
