Decided November 26, 2012\n\n\n  PER CURIAM.\n  State courts rather than federal courts are most fre­\nquently called upon to apply the Federal Arbitration Act\n(FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., including the Act’s national\npolicy favoring arbitration. It is a matter of great im­\nportance, therefore, that state supreme courts adhere to a\ncorrect interpretation of the legislation. Here, the Okla­\nhoma Supreme Court failed to do so. By declaring the\nnoncompetition agreements in two employment contracts\nnull and void, rather than leaving that determination to\nthe arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored\na basic tenet of the Act’s substantive arbitration law. The\ndecision must be vacated.\n                       *    *     *\n  This dispute arises from a contract between petitioner\nNitro-Lift Technologies, L. L. C., and two of its former\nemployees. Nitro-Lift contracts with operators of oil and\ngas wells to provide services that enhance production.\nRespondents Eddie Lee Howard and Shane D. Schneider\nentered a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement\nwith Nitro-Lift that contained the following arbitration\nclause:\n    “ ‘Any dispute, difference or unresolved question be­\n    tween Nitro-Lift and the Employee (collectively the\n    “Disputing Parties”) shall be settled by arbitration by\n    a single arbitrator mutually agreeable to the Disput­\n    ing Parties in an arbitration proceeding conducted in\n2      NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L.

Claiming that respondents\nhad breached their noncompetition agreements, Nitro-Lift\nserved them with a demand for arbitration. Respondents\nthen filed suit in the District Court of Johnston County,\nOklahoma, asking the court to declare the noncompetition\nagreements null and void and to enjoin their enforcement.\nThe court dismissed the complaint, finding that the con­\ntracts contained valid arbitration clauses under which an\narbitrator, and not the court, must settle the parties’\ndisagreement.\n  The Oklahoma Supreme Court retained respondents’\nappeal and ordered the parties to show cause why the\nmatter should not be resolved by application of Okla.\nStat., Tit. 15, §219A (West 2011), which limits the en­\nforceability of noncompetition agreements.         Nitro-Lift\nargued that any dispute as to the contracts’ enforceability\nwas a question for the arbitrator. It relied for support—\nas it had done before the trial court—upon several of this\nCourt’s cases interpreting the FAA, and noted that under\nBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U. S. 440,\n446 (2006), “this arbitration law applies in both state and\nfederal courts.” Record in No. 109,003 (Okla.), p. 273.\n  The Oklahoma Supreme Court was not persuaded. It\nheld that despite the “[U. S.] Supreme Court cases on\nwhich the employers rely,” the “existence of an arbitration\nagreement in an employment contract does not prohibit\njudicial review of the underlying agreement.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n¶15, n. 20, ¶16, 273 P. 3d 20, 26, n. 20, 27.

Stat., Tit. 15, §219A. 273 P. 3d,\nat 27.\n   The Oklahoma Supreme Court declared that its decision\nrests on adequate and independent state grounds. Id., at\n23–24, n. 5. If that were so, we would have no jurisdiction\nover this case. See Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032,\n1037–1044 (1983). It is not so, however, because the\ncourt’s reliance on Oklahoma law was not “independent”—\nit necessarily depended upon a rejection of the federal\nclaim, which was both “ ‘properly presented to’ ” and “ ‘ad­\ndressed by’ ” the state court. Howell v. Mississippi, 543\nU. S. 440, 443 (2005) (per curiam) (quoting Adams v.\nRobertson, 520 U. S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam)). Nitro-\nLift claimed that the arbitrator should decide the con­\ntract’s validity, and raised a federal-law basis for that\nclaim by relying on Supreme Court cases construing the\nFAA. “ ‘[A] litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can\neasily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a\nstate-court petition or brief . . . by citing in conjunction\nwith the claim the federal source of law on which he relies\nor a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds . . . .’ ”\nHowell, supra, at 444 (quoting Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S.\n27, 32 (2004); emphasis added). The Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied,\nas well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount\nthese controlling decisions. Its conclusion that, despite\nthis Court’s jurisprudence, the underlying contract’s valid­\nity is purely a matter of state law for state-court deter­\nmination is all the more reason for this Court to assert\njurisdiction.\n4      NITRO-LIFT TECHNOLOGIES, L. L. C. v. HOWARD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\n    The Oklahoma Supreme Court’s decision disregards this\nCourt’s precedents on the FAA. That Act, which “de­\nclare[s] a national policy favoring arbitration,” Southland\nCorp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 10 (1984), provides that a\n“written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transac­\ntion involving commerce to settle by arbitration a contro­\nversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon\nsuch grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. It is well settled that\n“the substantive law the Act created [is] applicable in state\nand federal courts.” Southland Corp., supra, at 12; see\nalso Buckeye, supra, at 446. And when parties commit to\narbitrate contractual disputes, it is a mainstay of the Act’s\nsubstantive law that attacks on the validity of the con­\ntract, as distinct from attacks on the validity of the arbi­\ntration clause itself, are to be resolved “by the arbitrator\nin the first instance, not by a federal or state court.”\nPreston v. Ferrer, 552 U. S. 346, 349 (2008); see also Prima\nPaint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S. 395\n(1967). For these purposes, an “arbitration provision is\nseverable from the remainder of the contract,” Buckeye,\nsupra, at 445, and its validity is subject to initial court\ndetermination; but the validity of the remainder of the\ncontract (if the arbitration provision is valid) is for the\narbitrator to decide.\n    This principle requires that the decision below be va­\ncated. The trial court found that the contract contained a\nvalid arbitration clause, and the Oklahoma Supreme\nCourt did not hold otherwise. It nonetheless assumed the\narbitrator’s role by declaring the noncompetition agree­\nments null and void. The state court insisted that its\n“[own] jurisprudence controls this issue” and permits\nreview of a “contract submitted to arbitration where one\nparty assert[s] that the underlying agreement [is] void and\nunenforceable.” 273 P. 3d, at 26. But the Oklahoma\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)              5\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nSupreme Court must abide by the FAA, which is “the\nsupreme Law of the Land,” U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2, and\nby the opinions of this Court interpreting that law. “It\nis this Court’s responsibility to say what a statute means,\nand once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other\ncourts to respect that understanding of the governing rule\nof law.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298,\n312 (1994). Our cases hold that the FAA forecloses pre­\ncisely this type of “judicial hostility towards arbitration.”\nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 8).\n   The state court reasoned that Oklahoma’s statute “ad­\ndressing the validity of covenants not to compete, must\ngovern over the more general statute favoring arbitration.”\n273 P. 3d, at 26, n. 21. But the ancient interpretive prin­\nciple that the specific governs the general (generalia spe-\ncialibus non derogant) applies only to conflict between\nlaws of equivalent dignity. Where a specific statute, for\nexample, conflicts with a general constitutional provision,\nthe latter governs. And the same is true where a specific\nstate statute conflicts with a general federal statute.\nThere is no general-specific exception to the Supremacy\nClause, U. S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2. “ ‘[W]hen state law\nprohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule\nis displaced by the FAA.’ ” Marmet Health Care Center,\nInc. v. Brown, 565 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (per curiam)\n(slip op., at 3–4) (quoting AT&T Mobility LLC, supra, at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–7)). Hence, it is for the arbitrator to\ndecide in the first instance whether the covenants not to\ncompete are valid as a matter of applicable state law. See\nBuckeye, 546 U. S., at 445–446.\n   For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is\ngranted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklaho­\nma is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 812450, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2012/11/26/nitro-lift_technologies_l._l._c._v._howard.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "                 Cite as: 568 U.
