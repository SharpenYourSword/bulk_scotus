IDAHO\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                   COURT OF IDAHO\n\n           No. 11\u20131515. Decided November 26, 2012 \n\n\n    The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n    JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG and\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join, dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari.\n    The law has long recognized that criminal punishment\nis not appropriate for those who, by reason of insanity,\ncannot tell right from wrong. See 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Laws of England 24\u201325 (1769);\nM\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718\n(1843). The insanity defense in nearly every State incor-\nporates this principle. See Clark v. Arizona, 548 U. S.\n735, 750\u2013752 (2006) (noting that all but four States recog-\nnize some version of the insanity defense); R. Bonnie, A.\nCoughlin, J. Jeffries, & P. Low, Criminal Law 604 (3d ed.\n2010) (same). If a defendant establishes an insanity de-\nfense, he is not criminally liable, though the government\nmay confine him civilly for as long as he continues to pose\na danger to himself or to others by reason of his mental\nillness. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 370 (1983).\n    Idaho and a few other States have modified this tra-\nditional insanity defense. Indeed, Idaho provides that\n\u201c[m]ental condition shall not be a defense to any charge of\ncriminal conduct.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a718\u2013207(1) (Lexis 2004).\nAnother provision of the same statute provides, however,\nthat the above restriction is not \u201cintended to prevent the\nadmission of expert evidence on the issue of any state of\nmind which is an element of the offense.\u201d \u00a718\u2013207(3). And\nthe Idaho courts have made clear that prosecutors are\n\u201c \u2018still required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a\n2                    DELLING v. IDAHO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndefendant had the mental capacity to form the necessary\nintent.\u201d \u2019 152 Idaho 122, 125, 267 P. 3d 709, 712 (2011)\n(quoting State v. Card, 121 Idaho 425, 430, 825 P. 2d 1081,\n1086 (1991)). Thus, in Idaho, insanity remains relevant to\ncriminal liability, but only in respect to intent. Insanity\ncontinues to have relevance at sentencing as well. A court\nmust \u201creceiv[e]\u201d evidence of mental condition at sentenc-\ning and, if mental condition proves to be a \u201csignificant\nfactor,\u201d must consider a string of issues deemed relevant\nto punishment, including, notably, \u201c[t]he capacity of the\ndefendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct.\u201d\nIdaho Code \u00a719\u20132523 (Lexis 2004). In addition, if the\ncourt imposes a prison sentence on a person who \u201csuffers\nfrom any mental condition requiring treatment,\u201d Idaho\nlaw appears to mandate that \u201cthe defendant shall receive\ntreatment\u201d in an appropriate facility. See \u00a718\u2013207(2).\n   Still, the step that Idaho has taken is significant. As\nthat State\u2019s courts recognize, it \u201c \u2018may allow the conviction\nof persons who may be insane by some former insanity\ntest or medical standard, but who nevertheless have the\nability to form intent and to control their actions.\u201d \u2019 152\nIdaho, at 125, 267 P. 3d, at 712. That is, the difference\nbetween the traditional insanity defense and Idaho\u2019s\nstandard is that the latter permits the conviction of an\nindividual who knew what he was doing, but had no capac-\nity to understand that it was wrong.\n   To illustrate with a very much simplified example:\nIdaho law would distinguish the following two cases. Case\nOne: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that the\nvictim is a wolf. He shoots and kills the victim. Case Two:\nThe defendant, due to insanity, believes that a wolf, a\nsupernatural figure, has ordered him to kill the victim. In\nCase One, the defendant does not know he has killed a\nhuman being, and his insanity negates a mental element\nnecessary to commit the crime. Cf. Clark, supra, at 767\u2013\n768 (offering a similar example of how mental illness may\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrebut mens rea). In Case Two, the defendant has inten-\ntionally killed a victim whom he knows is a human be-\ning; he possesses the necessary mens rea. In both cases the\ndefendant is unable, due to insanity, to appreciate the true\nquality of his act, and therefore unable to perceive that it\nis wrong. But in Idaho, the defendant in Case One could\ndefend the charge by arguing that he lacked the mens rea,\nwhereas the defendant in Case Two would not be able to\nraise a defense based on his mental illness. Much the\nsame outcome seems likely to occur in other States that\nhave modified the insanity defense in similar ways. For\nexample, in State v. Bethel, 276 Kan. 456, 459, 66 P. 3d\n840, 843 (Kan. 2003), the prosecution and defense agreed\nthat under a similar Kansas statute, evidence that a\nschizophrenic defendant\u2019s \u201cmental state precluded him\nfrom understanding the difference between right and\nwrong or from understanding the consequences of his\nactions . . . does not constitute a defense to the charged\ncrimes.\u201d\n   The American Psychiatric Association tells us that\n\u201csevere mental illness can seriously impair a sufferer\u2019s\nability rationally to appreciate the wrongfulness of con-\nduct.\u201d Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as\nAmici Curiae 15. And other amici tell us that those seri-\nously mentally ill individuals often possess the kind of\nmental disease that Case Two describes\u2014that is to say,\nthey know that the victim is a human being, but due to\nmental illness, such as a paranoid delusion, they wrongly\nbelieve the act is justified. Brief for 52 Criminal Law and\nMental Health Law Professors 10. In view of these sub-\nmissions, I would grant the petition for certiorari to con-\nsider whether Idaho\u2019s modification of the insanity defense\nis consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause.\n",
