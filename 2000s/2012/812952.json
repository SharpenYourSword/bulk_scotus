KENTUCKY\n  ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME \n\n                 COURT OF KENTUCKY\n\n           No. 11\u201310974.   Decided December 3, 2012\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Petitioner Benny Lee Hodge was convicted of murder.\nThen, after his trial counsel failed to present any mitiga-\ntion evidence during the penalty phase of his trial, he was\nsentenced to death. In fact, counsel had not even investi-\ngated any possible grounds for mitigation. If counsel had\nmade any effort, he would have found that Hodge, as a\nchild, suffered what the Kentucky Supreme Court called\na \u201cmost severe and unimaginable level of physical and\nmental abuse.\u201d No. 2009\u2013SC\u2013000791\u2013MR (Aug. 25, 2011),\nApp. to Pet for Cert. 11. The Commonwealth conceded\nthat counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient\nas a result. Yet the court below concluded that Hodge\nwould have been sentenced to death anyway because even\nif this evidence had been presented, it would not have\n\u201cexplained\u201d his actions, and thus the jury would have ar-\nrived at the same result. Ibid. This was error. Mitiga-\ntion evidence need not, and rarely could, \u201cexplai[n]\u201d a\nheinous crime; rather, mitigation evidence allows a jury to\nmake a reasoned moral decision whether the individual\ndefendant deserves to be executed, or to be shown mercy\ninstead. The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s error of law could\nwell have led to an error in result. I would grant the\npetition for certiorari, summarily vacate, and remand to\nallow the Kentucky Supreme Court to reconsider its deci-\nsion under the proper standard.\n                           I\n  Hodge and two others posed as Federal Bureau of Inves-\n2                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntigation agents to gain entry to the home of a doctor. Once\ninside, they strangled the doctor into unconsciousness,\nstabbed his college-aged daughter to death, and stole\naround $2 million in cash, as well as jewelry and guns,\nfrom a safe. A jury convicted Hodge and a codefendant of\nmurder and related charges. Epperson v. Commonwealth,\n809 S. W. 2d 835, 837 (Ky. 1990). In advance of the pen-\nalty phase of his trial, Hodge\u2019s counsel conducted no inves-\ntigation into potential mitigation evidence and presented\nno evidence to the jury. The Commonwealth did not put on\nevidence of aggravating circumstances either, beyond the\nfacts of the crime. Instead, the parties agreed that the\njury should be read this stipulation: \u201c \u2018Benny Lee Hodge\nhas a loving and supportive family\u2014a wife and three\nchildren. He has a public job work record and he lives and\nresides permanently in Tennessee.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n5. After hearing argument from counsel on both sides, the\njury recommended a sentence of death, which the trial\ncourt imposed.\n   On postconviction review in Kentucky state court,\nHodge alleged that his counsel had been ineffective dur-\ning the penalty phase for failing to investigate, discover,\nand present readily available mitigation evidence concern-\ning his childhood, which was marked by extreme abuse.\nHodge was granted an evidentiary hearing, during which\nhe presented extensive mitigation evidence and the testi-\nmony of expert psychologists. The Commonwealth did not\ncontest Hodge\u2019s evidence, although it did not concede that\nall the evidence would have been available or admissible\nat the time of trial. The Kentucky Supreme Court cred-\nited the evidence and found it would have been available\nat the time of trial. The evidence established the following:\n   The beatings began in utero. Hodge\u2019s father battered\nhis mother while she carried Hodge in her womb, and con-\ntinued to beat her once Hodge was born, even while she\nheld the infant in her arms. When Hodge was a few years\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)          3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nolder, he escaped his mother\u2019s next husband, a drunkard,\nby staying with his stepfather\u2019s parents, bootleggers who\nran a brothel. His mother next married Billy Joe. Family\nmembers described Billy Joe as a \u201c \u2018monster.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 7.\nBilly Joe controlled what little money the family had,\nleaving them to live in abject poverty. He beat Hodge\u2019s\nmother relentlessly, once so severely that she had a mis-\ncarriage. He raped her regularly. And he threatened to\nkill her while pointing a gun at her. All of this abuse\noccurred while Hodge and his sisters could see or hear.\nAnd following many beatings, Hodge and his sisters\nthought their mother was dead.\n  Billy Joe also targeted Hodge\u2019s sisters, molesting at\nleast one of them. But according to neighbors and family\nmembers, as the only male in the house, Hodge bore the\nbrunt of Billy Joe\u2019s anger, especially when he tried to\ndefend his mother and sisters from attack. Billy Joe of-\nten beat Hodge with a belt, sometimes leaving imprints\nfrom his belt buckle on Hodge\u2019s body. Hodge was kicked,\nthrown against walls, and punched. Billy Joe once made\nHodge watch while he brutally killed Hodge\u2019s dog. On\nanother occasion, Billy Joe rubbed Hodge\u2019s nose in his own\nfeces.\n  The abuse took its toll on Hodge. He had been an aver-\nage student in school, but he began to change when Billy\nJoe entered his life. He started stealing around age 12,\nand wound up in juvenile detention for his crimes. There,\nHodge was beaten routinely and subjected to frequent\nverbal and emotional abuse. After assaulting Billy Joe\nat age 16, Hodge returned to juvenile detention, where\nthe abuse continued. Hodge remained there until he\nwas 18. Over the 16 years between his release from juve-\nnile detention and the murder, Hodge committed various\ntheft crimes that landed him in prison for about 13 of\nthose years. He twice escaped, but each time, he was\nrecaptured.\n4                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Psychologists who testified at Hodge\u2019s evidentiary hear-\ning, and were credited by the court below, explained that\nthe degree of domestic violence Hodge suffered was ex-\ntremely damaging to his development. The environment\ncaused \u201c \u2018hypervigilance\u2019 \u201d\u2014a state of constant anxiety that\nleft Hodge always \u201c \u2018waiting for the next shoe to fall.\u2019 \u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. 7. It taught him \u201c \u2018that the world was a hos-\ntile place and that he was not going to be able to count\non anybody else to protect him\u2019 \u201d\u2014not his family and not\nsociety. Id., at 8. Being taken to a juvenile facility only to\nbe beaten more likely hit Hodge as a \u201c \u2018double betrayal.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 9. The result was that Hodge had posttraumatic\nstress disorder. Unable to control his behavior and his\nemotions because of PTSD, he turned to drugs and alcohol\nto numb his feelings. This condition could have been\ndiagnosed at the time of his trial.\n   The Commonwealth conceded that counsel was deficient\nfor failing to gather and present this evidence at the pen-\nalty phase of Hodge\u2019s trial. But it contended that Hodge\nwould have been sentenced to death even if the evidence\nhad been presented. Examining the evidence, the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court had \u201cno doubt that Hodge, as a\nchild, suffered a most severe and unimaginable level of\nphysical and mental abuse.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Yet\nit felt \u201ccompelled to reach the conclusion that there exists\nno reasonable probability that the jury would not have\nsentenced Hodge to death\u201d anyway. Ibid.\n   The Court based its conclusion in part on the aggra-\nvating circumstances against which the jury would have\nhad to weigh the mitigation evidence. The murder itself\nwas \u201ccalculated and exceedingly cold-hearted.\u201d Id., at 9.\nHodge stabbed the daughter \u201cat least ten times,\u201d and he\n\u201ccoolly\u201d told his codefendant that he knew the daughter\n\u201cwas dead because the knife had gone \u2018all the way through\nher to the floor.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 10. Hodge\u2019s conduct after the\nmurder was shocking as well: He and the two other rob-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            5\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbers \u201cbrazenly spent the stolen money on a lavish lifestyle\nand luxury goods, including a Corvette,\u201d and Hodge told a\ncellmate he had \u201csprea[d] all the money out on a bed and\nha[d] sex with his girlfriend on top of it.\u201d Ibid. Moreover,\nhad Hodge put on evidence in mitigation, the Common-\nwealth may have sought to introduce evidence of Hodge\u2019s\n\u201clong and increasingly violent criminal history, his numer-\nous escapes from custody, and the obvious failure of sev-\neral rehabilitative efforts.\u201d Id., at 9.\n   The court\u2019s conclusion was also based, however, on what\neffect the mitigation evidence might have had:\n    \u201cPerhaps this information may have offered insight\n    for the jury, providing some explanation for the career\n    criminal he later became. If it had been admitted, the\n    PTSD diagnosis offered in mitigation might have ex-\n    plained Hodge\u2019s substance abuse, or perhaps even a\n    crime committed in a fit of rage as a compulsive re-\n    action. But it offers virtually no rationale for the\n    premeditated, cold-blooded murder and attempted\n    murder of two innocent victims who were complete\n    strangers to Hodge. Many, if not most, malefactors\n    committing terribly violent and cruel murders are the\n    subjects of terrible childhoods. Even if the sentencing\n    jury had this mitigation evidence before it, we do not\n    believe, in light of the particularly depraved and bru-\n    tal nature of these crimes, that it would have spared\n    Hodge the death penalty.\u201d Id., at 11.\nAccordingly, the court denied Hodge relief.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment guarantees capital defendants\nthe effective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of trial. This right includes counsel\u2019s \u201cobligation to\nconduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s back-\nground,\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000), so\n6                       HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas \u201cto uncover and present . . . mitigating evidence\u201d to\nthe jury at sentencing. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n522 (2003). It is uncontested that trial counsel failed to\ndischarge that duty here. But to establish a Sixth\nAmendment violation, Hodge must also demonstrate that\ncounsel\u2019s failures prejudiced his defense. In Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we explained that a\n\u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694.\nIn the capital sentencing context, to assess prejudice, \u201cwe\nreweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534;\nsee also Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 10\u201311); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n30, 41 (2009) (per curiam); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.\n374, 393 (2005). The critical question is whether \u201cthere is\na reasonable probability that at least one juror would have\nstruck a different balance\u201d in weighing the evidence for\nand against sentencing the defendant to death. Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 537.*\n   In applying this standard, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nproperly took account of the possible evidence in aggrava-\ntion. But in discounting the countervailing effect of\nHodge\u2019s proposed mitigation, the court misunderstood the\npurpose of mitigation evidence. The court reasoned that\nHodge\u2019s mitigation evidence might have altered the jury\u2019s\nrecommendation only if it \u201cexplained\u201d or provided some\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * At\n       the time Hodge was sentenced, Kentucky required jury unanim-\nity to recommend a sentence of death. Cf. Carson v. Commonwealth,\n382 S. W. 2d 85, 95 (Ky. App. 1964); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7532.025\n(Michie 1985). The trial court was responsible for the ultimate sentenc-\ning determination, but the jury\u2019s recommendation was to \u201ccarr[y] great\nweight\u201d in that decision. Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S. W. 2d 97, 104\n(Ky. 1980). See also Porter, 558 U. S., at 40, 42 (applying Wiggins to an\n\u201cadvisory jury\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\u201crationale\u201d for his conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. We\nhave made clear for over 30 years, however, that mitiga-\ntion does not play so limited a role. In Lockett v. Ohio, 438\nU. S. 586 (1978), we held that the sentencer in a capital\ncase must be given a full opportunity to consider, as a\nmitigating factor, \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character\nor record,\u201d in addition to \u201cany of the circumstances of\nthe offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen-\ntence less than death.\u201d Id., at 604 (plurality opinion)\n(emphasis added). We emphasized the \u201cneed for treating\neach defendant in a capital case with that degree of re-\nspect due the uniqueness of the individual.\u201d Id., at 605.\nThis rule \u201crecognizes that \u2018justice . . . requires . . . that\nthere be taken into account the circumstances of the of-\nfense together with the character and propensities of the\noffender,\u2019 \u201d as part of deciding whether the defendant is\nto live or die. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112\n(1982) (quoting Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302\nU. S. 51, 55 (1937)). And it ensures that \u201c \u2018the sentence\nimposed at the penalty stage . . . reflect[s] a reasoned\nmoral response to the defendant\u2019s background, character,\nand crime.\u2019 \u201d Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 550 U. S. 233,\n252 (2007) (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,\n545 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)).\n   Thus we have consistently rejected States\u2019 attempts to\nlimit as irrelevant evidence of a defendant\u2019s background or\ncharacter that he wishes to offer in mitigation. In Skipper\nv. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), for example, we held\nthat the exclusion of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s\ngood behavior in jail while awaiting trial deprived him of\n\u201chis right to place before the sentencer relevant evidence\nin mitigation of punishment.\u201d Id., at 4. We explained that\nthe jury \u201ccould have drawn favorable inferences . . . re-\ngarding [the defendant\u2019s] character and his probable\nfuture conduct.\u201d Ibid. Although \u201cany such inferences\nwould not relate specifically to [the defendant\u2019s] culpabil-\n8                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nity for the crime he committed, . . . such inferences would\nbe \u2018mitigating\u2019 in the sense that they might serve \u2018as a\nbasis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 4\u20135 (quoting\nLockett, 438 U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion)).\n   Particularly instructive is Smith v. Texas, 543 U. S. 37\n(2004) (per curiam). In Smith, the Texas courts withheld\na mitigation instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s back-\nground, on the ground that he had offered \u201cno evidence of\nany link or nexus between his troubled childhood or his\nlimited mental abilities and this capital murder.\u201d Ex parte\nSmith, 132 S. W. 3d 407, 414 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). We\nrejected this \u201cnexus\u201d requirement as one we had \u201cnever\ncountenanced,\u201d and we reiterated that the only relevant\nquestion is whether the proposed mitigation evidence\nwould give a jury \u201ca reason to impose a sentence more\nlenient than death.\u201d 543 U. S., at 44\u201345.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s opinion is plainly con-\ntrary to these precedents. The evidence of Hodge\u2019s brutal\nupbringing need not have offered any \u201crationale\u201d for the\nmurder he committed in order for the jury to have consid-\nered it as weighty mitigation. It would be enough if there\nwere a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, because of Hodge\u2019s\ntragic past, the jury\u2019s \u201creasoned moral response\u201d would\ninstead have been to spare his life and sentence him to life\nimprisonment instead.\n   More fundamentally, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nappears to believe that in cases involving \u201cviolent and\ncruel murders,\u201d it does not matter that the \u201cmalefacto[r]\u201d\nhad a \u201cterrible childhoo[d]\u201d; the jury would return a death\nsentence regardless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. That view\nis contrary to our cases applying Strickland\u2019s prejudice\nprong. In Rompilla, for example, we considered counsel\u2019s\nfailure \u201cto present significant mitigating evidence about\nRompilla\u2019s childhood,\u201d which was as horrific as Hodge\u2019s, as\nwell as his \u201cmental capacity and health, and alcoholism.\u201d\n545 U. S., at 378; see id., at 391\u2013392 (describing the abuse\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin Rompilla\u2019s household while he was young). We con-\ncluded that \u201cthe undiscovered mitigating evidence, taken\nas a whole, might well have influenced the jury\u2019s appraisal\nof Rompilla\u2019s culpability, and the likelihood of a different\nresult if the evidence had gone in is sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome actually reached at sen-\ntencing.\u201d Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted). We reached this conclusion not-\nwithstanding that Rompilla had been convicted of stab-\nbing a man repeatedly and setting him on fire. Id., at 377.\nSimilarly, we found prejudice in Wiggins even though the\ndefendant had drowned a 77-year-old woman in her bath-\ntub. 539 U. S., at 514. The evidence of \u201csevere physical\nand sexual abuse\u201d Wiggins suffered as a child was suffi-\nciently \u201cpowerful\u201d that \u201c[h]ad the jury been able to place\n[Wiggins\u2019] excruciating life history on the mitigating side\nof the scale, there [was] a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d Id.,\nat 516, 534, 537.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s brief discussion of the\nweight and impact of Hodge\u2019s mitigation evidence reason-\nably suggests that its prejudice determination flowed from\nits legal errors. Perhaps if the court had afforded proper\nconsideration to the mitigation evidence, it still would\nhave reached the same result; it might have found no\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury would have weighed\nHodge\u2019s difficult past more heavily in its moral calculation\nthan the callous nature of the crime and Hodge\u2019s history\nof imprisonment and escape. But, giving full effect to the\nmitigation evidence, the court may well have concluded\nthat the story of Hodge\u2019s childhood was so extraordinary,\n\u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at least one ju-\nror would have struck a different balance\u201d had the jury\nknown. Id., at 537; see also Porter, 558 U. S., at 42. A\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d is only \u201ca probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland, 466\n10                 HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 694. Absent its errors, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt may have found that minimal threshold met on\nthese facts.\n  We are a reviewing court, so I would leave it to the\nKentucky Supreme Court to reweigh the evidence under\nthe proper standards in the first instance. But this is a\ncapital case, and clear errors of law such as those here\nshould be redressed. I respectfully dissent from our fail-\nure to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-\nment below, and remand for further consideration.\n",

I would grant the\npetition for certiorari, summarily vacate, and remand to\nallow the Kentucky Supreme Court to reconsider its deci-\nsion under the proper standard.\n                           I\n  Hodge and two others posed as Federal Bureau of Inves-\n2                   HODGE v.

Once\ninside, they strangled the doctor into unconsciousness,\nstabbed his college-aged daughter to death, and stole\naround $2 million in cash, as well as jewelry and guns,\nfrom a safe. A jury convicted Hodge and a codefendant of\nmurder and related charges. Epperson v. Commonwealth,\n809 S. W. 2d 835, 837 (Ky. 1990). In advance of the pen-\nalty phase of his trial, Hodge\u2019s counsel conducted no inves-\ntigation into potential mitigation evidence and presented\nno evidence to the jury. The Commonwealth did not put on\nevidence of aggravating circumstances either, beyond the\nfacts of the crime. Instead, the parties agreed that the\njury should be read this stipulation: \u201c \u2018Benny Lee Hodge\nhas a loving and supportive family\u2014a wife and three\nchildren. He has a public job work record and he lives and\nresides permanently in Tennessee.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n5. After hearing argument from counsel on both sides, the\njury recommended a sentence of death, which the trial\ncourt imposed.\n   On postconviction review in Kentucky state court,\nHodge alleged that his counsel had been ineffective dur-\ning the penalty phase for failing to investigate, discover,\nand present readily available mitigation evidence concern-\ning his childhood, which was marked by extreme abuse.\nHodge was granted an evidentiary hearing, during which\nhe presented extensive mitigation evidence and the testi-\nmony of expert psychologists. The Commonwealth did not\ncontest Hodge\u2019s evidence, although it did not concede that\nall the evidence would have been available or admissible\nat the time of trial. The Kentucky Supreme Court cred-\nited the evidence and found it would have been available\nat the time of trial. The evidence established the following:\n   The beatings began in utero. Hodge\u2019s father battered\nhis mother while she carried Hodge in her womb, and con-\ntinued to beat her once Hodge was born, even while she\nheld the infant in her arms. When Hodge was a few years\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)          3\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nolder, he escaped his mother\u2019s next husband, a drunkard,\nby staying with his stepfather\u2019s parents, bootleggers who\nran a brothel. His mother next married Billy Joe. Family\nmembers described Billy Joe as a \u201c \u2018monster.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 7.\nBilly Joe controlled what little money the family had,\nleaving them to live in abject poverty. He beat Hodge\u2019s\nmother relentlessly, once so severely that she had a mis-\ncarriage. He raped her regularly. And he threatened to\nkill her while pointing a gun at her. All of this abuse\noccurred while Hodge and his sisters could see or hear.\nAnd following many beatings, Hodge and his sisters\nthought their mother was dead.\n  Billy Joe also targeted Hodge\u2019s sisters, molesting at\nleast one of them. But according to neighbors and family\nmembers, as the only male in the house, Hodge bore the\nbrunt of Billy Joe\u2019s anger, especially when he tried to\ndefend his mother and sisters from attack. Billy Joe of-\nten beat Hodge with a belt, sometimes leaving imprints\nfrom his belt buckle on Hodge\u2019s body. Hodge was kicked,\nthrown against walls, and punched. Billy Joe once made\nHodge watch while he brutally killed Hodge\u2019s dog. On\nanother occasion, Billy Joe rubbed Hodge\u2019s nose in his own\nfeces.\n  The abuse took its toll on Hodge. He had been an aver-\nage student in school, but he began to change when Billy\nJoe entered his life. He started stealing around age 12,\nand wound up in juvenile detention for his crimes. There,\nHodge was beaten routinely and subjected to frequent\nverbal and emotional abuse. After assaulting Billy Joe\nat age 16, Hodge returned to juvenile detention, where\nthe abuse continued. Hodge remained there until he\nwas 18. Over the 16 years between his release from juve-\nnile detention and the murder, Hodge committed various\ntheft crimes that landed him in prison for about 13 of\nthose years. He twice escaped, but each time, he was\nrecaptured.\n4                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Psychologists who testified at Hodge\u2019s evidentiary hear-\ning, and were credited by the court below, explained that\nthe degree of domestic violence Hodge suffered was ex-\ntremely damaging to his development. The environment\ncaused \u201c \u2018hypervigilance\u2019 \u201d\u2014a state of constant anxiety that\nleft Hodge always \u201c \u2018waiting for the next shoe to fall.\u2019 \u201d Pet.\nfor Cert. 7. It taught him \u201c \u2018that the world was a hos-\ntile place and that he was not going to be able to count\non anybody else to protect him\u2019 \u201d\u2014not his family and not\nsociety. Id., at 8. Being taken to a juvenile facility only to\nbe beaten more likely hit Hodge as a \u201c \u2018double betrayal.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 9. The result was that Hodge had posttraumatic\nstress disorder. Unable to control his behavior and his\nemotions because of PTSD, he turned to drugs and alcohol\nto numb his feelings. This condition could have been\ndiagnosed at the time of his trial.\n   The Commonwealth conceded that counsel was deficient\nfor failing to gather and present this evidence at the pen-\nalty phase of Hodge\u2019s trial. But it contended that Hodge\nwould have been sentenced to death even if the evidence\nhad been presented. Examining the evidence, the Ken-\ntucky Supreme Court had \u201cno doubt that Hodge, as a\nchild, suffered a most severe and unimaginable level of\nphysical and mental abuse.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. Yet\nit felt \u201ccompelled to reach the conclusion that there exists\nno reasonable probability that the jury would not have\nsentenced Hodge to death\u201d anyway. Ibid.\n   The Court based its conclusion in part on the aggra-\nvating circumstances against which the jury would have\nhad to weigh the mitigation evidence. The murder itself\nwas \u201ccalculated and exceedingly cold-hearted.\u201d Id., at 9.\nHodge stabbed the daughter \u201cat least ten times,\u201d and he\n\u201ccoolly\u201d told his codefendant that he knew the daughter\n\u201cwas dead because the knife had gone \u2018all the way through\nher to the floor.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 10. Hodge\u2019s conduct after the\nmurder was shocking as well: He and the two other rob-\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Moreover,\nhad Hodge put on evidence in mitigation, the Common-\nwealth may have sought to introduce evidence of Hodge\u2019s\n\u201clong and increasingly violent criminal history, his numer-\nous escapes from custody, and the obvious failure of sev-\neral rehabilitative efforts.\u201d Id., at 9.\n   The court\u2019s conclusion was also based, however, on what\neffect the mitigation evidence might have had:\n    \u201cPerhaps this information may have offered insight\n    for the jury, providing some explanation for the career\n    criminal he later became. If it had been admitted, the\n    PTSD diagnosis offered in mitigation might have ex-\n    plained Hodge\u2019s substance abuse, or perhaps even a\n    crime committed in a fit of rage as a compulsive re-\n    action. But it offers virtually no rationale for the\n    premeditated, cold-blooded murder and attempted\n    murder of two innocent victims who were complete\n    strangers to Hodge. Many, if not most, malefactors\n    committing terribly violent and cruel murders are the\n    subjects of terrible childhoods. Even if the sentencing\n    jury had this mitigation evidence before it, we do not\n    believe, in light of the particularly depraved and bru-\n    tal nature of these crimes, that it would have spared\n    Hodge the death penalty.\u201d Id., at 11.\nAccordingly, the court denied Hodge relief.\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment guarantees capital defendants\nthe effective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of trial. This right includes counsel\u2019s \u201cobligation to\nconduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s back-\nground,\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 396 (2000), so\n6                       HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nas \u201cto uncover and present . . . mitigating evidence\u201d to\nthe jury at sentencing. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510,\n522 (2003). It is uncontested that trial counsel failed to\ndischarge that duty here. But to establish a Sixth\nAmendment violation, Hodge must also demonstrate that\ncounsel\u2019s failures prejudiced his defense. In Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), we explained that a\n\u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probabil-\nity that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result\nof the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694.\nIn the capital sentencing context, to assess prejudice, \u201cwe\nreweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence.\u201d Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 534;\nsee also Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 10\u201311); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U. S.\n30, 41 (2009) (per curiam); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U. S.\n374, 393 (2005). The critical question is whether \u201cthere is\na reasonable probability that at least one juror would have\nstruck a different balance\u201d in weighing the evidence for\nand against sentencing the defendant to death. Wiggins,\n539 U. S., at 537.*\n   In applying this standard, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nproperly took account of the possible evidence in aggrava-\ntion. But in discounting the countervailing effect of\nHodge\u2019s proposed mitigation, the court misunderstood the\npurpose of mitigation evidence. The court reasoned that\nHodge\u2019s mitigation evidence might have altered the jury\u2019s\nrecommendation only if it \u201cexplained\u201d or provided some\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    * At\n       the time Hodge was sentenced, Kentucky required jury unanim-\nity to recommend a sentence of death. Cf. Carson v. Commonwealth,\n382 S. W. 2d 85, 95 (Ky. App. 1964); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7532.025\n(Michie 1985). The trial court was responsible for the ultimate sentenc-\ning determination, but the jury\u2019s recommendation was to \u201ccarr[y] great\nweight\u201d in that decision. Gall v. Commonwealth, 607 S. W. 2d 97, 104\n(Ky. 1980). See also Porter, 558 U. S., at 40, 42 (applying Wiggins to an\n\u201cadvisory jury\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n\u201crationale\u201d for his conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. We\nhave made clear for over 30 years, however, that mitiga-\ntion does not play so limited a role. In Lockett v. Ohio, 438\nU. S. 586 (1978), we held that the sentencer in a capital\ncase must be given a full opportunity to consider, as a\nmitigating factor, \u201cany aspect of a defendant\u2019s character\nor record,\u201d in addition to \u201cany of the circumstances of\nthe offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sen-\ntence less than death.\u201d Id., at 604 (plurality opinion)\n(emphasis added). We emphasized the \u201cneed for treating\neach defendant in a capital case with that degree of re-\nspect due the uniqueness of the individual.\u201d Id., at 605.\nThis rule \u201crecognizes that \u2018justice . . . requires . . . that\nthere be taken into account the circumstances of the of-\nfense together with the character and propensities of the\noffender,\u2019 \u201d as part of deciding whether the defendant is\nto live or die. Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112\n(1982) (quoting Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302\nU. S. 51, 55 (1937)). And it ensures that \u201c \u2018the sentence\nimposed at the penalty stage . . . reflect[s] a reasoned\nmoral response to the defendant\u2019s background, character,\nand crime.\u2019 \u201d Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman, 550 U. S. 233,\n252 (2007) (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,\n545 (1987) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)).\n   Thus we have consistently rejected States\u2019 attempts to\nlimit as irrelevant evidence of a defendant\u2019s background or\ncharacter that he wishes to offer in mitigation. In Skipper\nv. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), for example, we held\nthat the exclusion of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s\ngood behavior in jail while awaiting trial deprived him of\n\u201chis right to place before the sentencer relevant evidence\nin mitigation of punishment.\u201d Id., at 4. We explained that\nthe jury \u201ccould have drawn favorable inferences . . . re-\ngarding [the defendant\u2019s] character and his probable\nfuture conduct.\u201d Ibid. Although \u201cany such inferences\nwould not relate specifically to [the defendant\u2019s] culpabil-\n8                   HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nity for the crime he committed, . . . such inferences would\nbe \u2018mitigating\u2019 in the sense that they might serve \u2018as a\nbasis for a sentence less than death.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 4\u20135 (quoting\nLockett, 438 U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion)).\n   Particularly instructive is Smith v. Texas, 543 U. S. 37\n(2004) (per curiam). In Smith, the Texas courts withheld\na mitigation instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s back-\nground, on the ground that he had offered \u201cno evidence of\nany link or nexus between his troubled childhood or his\nlimited mental abilities and this capital murder.\u201d Ex parte\nSmith, 132 S. W. 3d 407, 414 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). We\nrejected this \u201cnexus\u201d requirement as one we had \u201cnever\ncountenanced,\u201d and we reiterated that the only relevant\nquestion is whether the proposed mitigation evidence\nwould give a jury \u201ca reason to impose a sentence more\nlenient than death.\u201d 543 U. S., at 44\u201345.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s opinion is plainly con-\ntrary to these precedents. The evidence of Hodge\u2019s brutal\nupbringing need not have offered any \u201crationale\u201d for the\nmurder he committed in order for the jury to have consid-\nered it as weighty mitigation. It would be enough if there\nwere a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, because of Hodge\u2019s\ntragic past, the jury\u2019s \u201creasoned moral response\u201d would\ninstead have been to spare his life and sentence him to life\nimprisonment instead.\n   More fundamentally, the Kentucky Supreme Court\nappears to believe that in cases involving \u201cviolent and\ncruel murders,\u201d it does not matter that the \u201cmalefacto[r]\u201d\nhad a \u201cterrible childhoo[d]\u201d; the jury would return a death\nsentence regardless. App. to Pet. for Cert. 11. That view\nis contrary to our cases applying Strickland\u2019s prejudice\nprong. In Rompilla, for example, we considered counsel\u2019s\nfailure \u201cto present significant mitigating evidence about\nRompilla\u2019s childhood,\u201d which was as horrific as Hodge\u2019s, as\nwell as his \u201cmental capacity and health, and alcoholism.\u201d\n545 U. S., at 378; see id., at 391\u2013392 (describing the abuse\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin Rompilla\u2019s household while he was young). We con-\ncluded that \u201cthe undiscovered mitigating evidence, taken\nas a whole, might well have influenced the jury\u2019s appraisal\nof Rompilla\u2019s culpability, and the likelihood of a different\nresult if the evidence had gone in is sufficient to under-\nmine confidence in the outcome actually reached at sen-\ntencing.\u201d Id., at 393 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted). We reached this conclusion not-\nwithstanding that Rompilla had been convicted of stab-\nbing a man repeatedly and setting him on fire. Id., at 377.\nSimilarly, we found prejudice in Wiggins even though the\ndefendant had drowned a 77-year-old woman in her bath-\ntub. 539 U. S., at 514. The evidence of \u201csevere physical\nand sexual abuse\u201d Wiggins suffered as a child was suffi-\nciently \u201cpowerful\u201d that \u201c[h]ad the jury been able to place\n[Wiggins\u2019] excruciating life history on the mitigating side\nof the scale, there [was] a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d Id.,\nat 516, 534, 537.\n   The Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s brief discussion of the\nweight and impact of Hodge\u2019s mitigation evidence reason-\nably suggests that its prejudice determination flowed from\nits legal errors. Perhaps if the court had afforded proper\nconsideration to the mitigation evidence, it still would\nhave reached the same result; it might have found no\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d that the jury would have weighed\nHodge\u2019s difficult past more heavily in its moral calculation\nthan the callous nature of the crime and Hodge\u2019s history\nof imprisonment and escape. But, giving full effect to the\nmitigation evidence, the court may well have concluded\nthat the story of Hodge\u2019s childhood was so extraordinary,\n\u201cthere is a reasonable probability that at least one ju-\nror would have struck a different balance\u201d had the jury\nknown. Id., at 537; see also Porter, 558 U. S., at 42. A\n\u201creasonable probability\u201d is only \u201ca probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Strickland, 466\n10                 HODGE v. KENTUCKY\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 694. Absent its errors, the Kentucky Supreme\nCourt may have found that minimal threshold met on\nthese facts.\n  We are a reviewing court, so I would leave it to the\nKentucky Supreme Court to reweigh the evidence under\nthe proper standards in the first instance. But this is a\ncapital case, and clear errors of law such as those here\nshould be redressed. I respectfully dissent from our fail-\nure to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-\nment below, and remand for further consideration.\n</pre>",
