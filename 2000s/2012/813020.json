Argued October 3, 2012\u2014Decided December 4, 2012\nPetitioner, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (Commission), owns\n  and manages the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management\n  Area (Management Area or Area), which comprises 23,000 acres\n  along the Black River that are forested with multiple hardwood oak\n  species and serve as a venue for recreation and hunting. In 1948, the\n  U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructed the Clearwater\n  Dam (Dam) upstream from the Management Area and adopted a\n  plan known as the Water Control Manual (Manual), which sets sea-\n  sonally varying rates for the release of water from the Dam. Periodi-\n  cally from 1993 until 2000, the Corps, at the request of farmers, au-\n  thorized deviations from the Manual that extended flooding into the\n  Management Area\u2019s peak timber growing season. The Commission\n  objected to the deviations on the ground that they adversely impacted\n  the Management Area, and opposed the Corps\u2019 proposal to make the\n  temporary deviations part of the Manual\u2019s permanent water-release\n  plan. After testing the effect of the deviations, the Corps abandoned\n  the proposed Manual revision and ceased its temporary deviations.\n    The Commission sued the United States, alleging that the tempo-\n  rary deviations constituted a taking of property that entitled the\n  Commission to compensation. The Commission maintained that the\n  deviations caused sustained flooding during tree-growing season, and\n  that the cumulative impact of the flooding caused the destruction of\n  timber in the Area and a substantial change in the character of the\n  terrain, necessitating costly reclamation measures. The Court of\n  Federal Claims\u2019 judgment in favor of the Commission was reversed\n  by the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that\n  temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if\n2     ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking. It\n    held, however, that government-induced flooding can give rise to a\n    taking claim only if the flooding is \u201cpermanent or inevitably recur-\n    ring.\u201d The Federal Circuit understood this conclusion to be dictated\n    by Sanguinetti v. United States, 264 U. S. 146, 150, and United States\n    v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 328.\nHeld: Government-induced flooding temporary in duration gains no\n automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection. Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) No magic formula enables a court to judge, in every case,\n whether a given government interference with property is a taking.\n This Court has drawn some bright lines, but in the main, takings\n claims turn on situation-specific factual inquiries. See Penn Central\n Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124.\n    As to the question whether temporary flooding can ever give rise to\n a takings claim, this Court has ruled that government-induced flood-\n ing, Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, and seasonally recur-\n ring flooding, Cress, 243 U. S., at 328, can constitute takings. The\n Court has also ruled that takings temporary in duration can be com-\n pensable. E.g., United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 266. This\n Court\u2019s precedent thus indicates that government-induced flooding of\n limited duration may be compensable. None of the Court\u2019s decisions\n authorizes a blanket temporary-flooding exception to the Court\u2019s Tak-\n ings Clause jurisprudence, and the Court declines to create such an\n exception in this case. Pp. 6\u20139.\n    (b) In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Government\n relies primarily on Sanguinetti, 264 U. S. 146, which held that no\n taking occurred when a government-constructed canal overflowed on-\n to the claimant\u2019s land. In its opinion, the Court summarized prior\n flooding cases as standing for the proposition that \u201cin order to create\n an enforceable liability against the Government, it is, at least, neces-\n sary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and con-\n stitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d Id., at 149. The\n Government urges the Court to extract from the quoted words a de-\n finitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods.\n But the Court does not read the passing reference to permanence in\n Sanguinetti as having done so much work. Sanguinetti was decided\n in 1924, well before the World War II-era cases and First English\n Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,\n 482 U. S. 304, in which the Court first homed in on the matter of\n compensation for temporary takings. There is no suggestion in San-\n guinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of\n takings claims.\n    The Court thus finds no solid grounding in precedent for setting\n flooding apart from other government intrusions on property. And\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.\n  Its primary argument is that reversing the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision\n  risks disrupting public works dedicated to flood control. While the\n  public interests here are important, they are not categorically differ-\n  ent from the interests at stake in myriad other Takings Clause cases\n  in which this Court has rejected similar arguments when deployed to\n  urge blanket exemptions from the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction.\n     The Government argues in the alternative that damage to down-\n  stream property, however foreseeable, is collateral or incidental; it is\n  not aimed at any particular landowner and therefore is not compen-\n  sable under the Takings Clause. The Court expresses no opinion on\n  this claim, which was first tendered at oral argument and not aired\n  in the courts below. For the same reason, the Court declines to ad-\n  dress the bearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n     (c) When regulation or temporary physical invasion by government\n  interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the\n  existence vel non of a compensable taking. See, e.g., Loretto v. Tele-\n  prompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 435, n. 12. Also rel-\n  evant to the takings inquiry is the degree to which the invasion is in-\n  tended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action.\n  See, e.g., John Horstmann Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 138, 146.\n  So, too, are the character of the land at issue and the owner\u2019s \u201crea-\n  sonable investment-backed expectations\u201d regarding the land\u2019s use,\n  Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 618, as well as the severity\n  of the interference, see, e.g., Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 130\u2013131. In\n  concluding that the flooding was foreseeable in this case, the Court of\n  Federal Claims noted the Commission\u2019s repeated complaints to the\n  Corps about the destructive impact of the successive planned devia-\n  tions and determined that the interference with the Commission\u2019s\n  property was severe. The Government, however, challenged several\n  of the trial court\u2019s factfindings, including those relating to causation,\n  foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of damages. Because\n  the Federal Circuit rested its decision entirely on the temporary du-\n  ration of the flooding, it did not address those challenges, which re-\n  main open for consideration on remand.

UNITED STATES\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Periodically from 1993 until 2000, the U. S. Army Corps\nof Engineers (Corps) authorized flooding that extended\ninto the peak growing season for timber on forest land\nowned and managed by petitioner, Arkansas Game and\nFish Commission (Commission). Cumulative in effect, the\nrepeated flooding damaged or destroyed more than 18\nmillion board feet of timber and disrupted the ordinary\nuse and enjoyment of the Commission\u2019s property. The\nCommission sought compensation from the United States\npursuant to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction: \u201c[N]or\nshall private property be taken for public use, without\njust compensation.\u201d The question presented is whether a\ntaking may occur, within the meaning of the Takings\nClause, when government-induced flood invasions, al-\nthough repetitive, are temporary.\n  Ordinarily, this Court\u2019s decisions confirm, if government\naction would qualify as a taking when permanently con-\ntinued, temporary actions of the same character may also\nqualify as a taking. In the instant case, the parties and\n2   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe courts below divided on the appropriate classification\nof temporary flooding. Reversing the judgment of the\nCourt of Federal Claims, which awarded compensation to\nthe Commission, the Federal Circuit held, 2 to 1, that\ncompensation may be sought only when flooding is \u201ca per-\nmanent or inevitably recurring condition, rather than an\ninherently temporary situation.\u201d 637 F. 3d 1366, 1378\n(2011). We disagree and conclude that recurrent flood-\nings, even if of finite duration, are not categorically ex-\nempt from Takings Clause liability.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Commission owns the Dave Donaldson Black River\nWildlife Management Area (Management Area or Area),\nwhich comprises 23,000 acres along both banks of the\nBlack River in northeast Arkansas. The Management\nArea is forested with multiple hardwood timber species\nthat support a variety of wildlife habitats. The Commis-\nsion operates the Management Area as a wildlife and\nhunting preserve, and also uses it as a timber resource,\nconducting regular harvests of timber as part of its forest-\nmanagement efforts. Three types of hardwood oak spe-\ncies\u2014nuttall, overcup, and willow\u2014account for 80 percent\nof the trees in the Management Area. The presence of\nthese hardwood oaks is essential to the Area\u2019s character as\na habitat for migratory birds and as a venue for recreation\nand hunting.\n  The Clearwater Dam (Dam) is located 115 miles up-\nstream from the Management Area. The Corps constructed\nthe Dam in 1948, and shortly thereafter adopted a plan\nknown as the Water Control Manual (Manual) to deter-\nmine the rates at which water would be released from the\nDam. The Manual sets seasonally varying release rates,\nbut permits planned deviations from the prescribed rates\nfor agricultural, recreational, and other purposes.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1993, the Corps approved a planned deviation in\nresponse to requests from farmers. From September to\nDecember 1993, the Corps released water from the Dam at\na slower rate than usual, providing downstream farmers\nwith a longer harvest time. As a result, more water than\nusual accumulated in Clearwater Lake behind the Dam.\nTo reduce the accumulation, the Corps extended the pe-\nriod in which a high amount of water would be released.\nThe Commission maintained this extension yielded down-\nstream flooding in the Management Area, above historical\nnorms, during the tree-growing season, which runs from\nApril to October. If the Corps had released the water\nmore rapidly in the fall of 1993, in accordance with the\nManual and with past practice, there would have been\nshort-term waves of flooding which would have receded\nquickly. The lower rate of release in the fall, however,\nextended the period of flooding well into the following\nspring and summer. While the deviation benefited farm-\ners, it interfered with the Management Area\u2019s tree-\ngrowing season.\n   The Corps adopted similar deviations each year from\n1994 through 2000. The record indicates that the decision\nto deviate from the Manual was made independently in\neach year and that the amount of deviation varied over the\nspan of years. Nevertheless, the result was an unbroken\nstring of annual deviations from the Manual. Each devia-\ntion lowered the rate at which water was released during\nthe fall, which necessitated extension of the release period\ninto the following spring and summer. During this span of\nyears the Corps proposed Manual revisions that would\nhave made its temporary deviations part of the permanent\nwater-release plan. On multiple occasions between 1993\nand 2000, the Commission objected to the temporary\ndeviations and opposed any permanent revision to the\nManual, on the ground that the departures from the tradi-\ntional water-release plan adversely impacted the Man-\n4   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagement Area. Ultimately, the Corps tested the effect of\nthe deviations on the Management Area. It thereupon\nabandoned the proposal to permanently revise the Manual\nand, in 2001, ceased its temporary deviations.\n                              B\n  In 2005, the Commission filed the instant lawsuit\nagainst the United States, claiming that the temporary\ndeviations from the Manual constituted a taking of prop-\nerty that entitled the Commission to compensation. The\nCommission maintained that the deviations caused sus-\ntained flooding of its land during the tree-growing season.\nThe cumulative impact of this flooding over a six-year\nperiod between 1993 and 1999, the Commission alleged,\nresulted in the destruction of timber in the Management\nArea and a substantial change in the character of the\nterrain, which necessitated costly reclamation measures.\nFollowing a trial, the Court of Federal Claims ruled in\nfavor of the Commission and issued an opinion and order\ncontaining detailed findings of fact. 87 Fed. Cl. 594\n(2009).\n  The Court of Federal Claims found that the forests in\nthe Management Area were healthy and flourishing before\nthe flooding that occurred in the 1990\u2019s, and that the\nforests had been sustainably managed for decades under\nthe water-release plan contained in the Manual. Id., at\n631. It further found that the Commission repeatedly\nobjected to the deviations from the Manual and alerted the\nCorps to the detrimental effect the longer period of flood-\ning would have on the hardwood timber in the Manage-\nment Area. Id., at 604.\n  As found by the Court of Federal Claims, the flooding\ncaused by the deviations contrasted markedly with histor-\nical flooding patterns. Between 1949 and 1992, the river\nlevel near the Management Area reached six feet an aver-\nage of 64.7 days per year during the growing season; the\nnumber of such days had been even lower on average\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the Clearwater Dam was built. Between 1993 and\n1999, however, the river reached the same level an aver-\nage of 91.14 days per year, an increase of more than 40\npercent over the historic average. Although the Manage-\nment Area lies in a floodplain, in no previously recorded\ntime span did comparable flooding patterns occur. Id., at\n607\u2013608. Evidence at trial indicated that half of the nut-\ntall oaks in the Management Area were saturated with\nwater when the river level was at six feet, id., at 608; the\nevidence further indicated that the saturation of the soil\naround the trees\u2019 root systems could persist for weeks even\nafter the flooding had receded. Id., at 627.\n  The court concluded that the Corps\u2019 deviations caused\nsix consecutive years of substantially increased flooding,\nwhich constituted an appropriation of the Commission\u2019s\nproperty, albeit a temporary rather than a permanent\none. Important to this conclusion, the court emphasized\nthe deviations\u2019 cumulative effect. The trees were subject\nto prolonged periods of flooding year after year, which\nreduced the oxygen level in the soil and considerably weak-\nened the trees\u2019 root systems. The repeated annual flood-\ning for six years altered the character of the property to\na much greater extent than would have been shown if\nthe harm caused by one year of flooding were simply multi-\nplied by six. When a moderate drought occurred in 1999\nand 2000, the trees did not have the root systems neces-\nsary to sustain themselves; the result, in the court\u2019s\nwords, was \u201ccatastrophic mortality.\u201d Id., at 632. More\nthan 18 million board feet of timber were destroyed or\ndegraded. Id., at 638\u2013640.\n  This damage altered the character of the Management\nArea. The destruction of the trees led to the invasion of\nundesirable plant species, making natural regeneration of\nthe forests improbable in the absence of reclamation ef-\nforts. Id., at 643. To determine the measure of just\ncompensation, the Court of Federal Claims calculated the\n6   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvalue of the lost timber and the projected cost of the rec-\nlamation and awarded the Commission $5.7 million.\n  The Federal Circuit reversed. It acknowledged that in\ngeneral, temporary government action may give rise to a\ntakings claim if permanent action of the same character\nwould constitute a taking. But it held that \u201ccases involv-\ning flooding and [flowage] easements are different.\u201d 637\nF. 3d, at 1374. Government-induced flooding can give rise\nto a taking claim, the Federal Circuit concluded, only if\nthe flooding is \u201cpermanent or inevitably recurring.\u201d Id.,\nat 1378. The Court of Appeals understood this conclusion\nto be dictated by this Court\u2019s decisions in Sanguinetti v.\nUnited States, 264 U. S. 146, 150 (1924), and United\nStates v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 328 (1917). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the question whether government\nactions that cause repeated floodings must be permanent\nor inevitably recurring to constitute a taking of property.\n566 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n   The Takings Clause is \u201cdesigned to bar Government\nfrom forcing some people alone to bear public burdens\nwhich, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the\npublic as a whole.\u201d Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S.\n40, 49 (1960). See also First English Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.\n304, 318\u2013319 (1987); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New\nYork City, 438 U. S. 104, 123\u2013125 (1978). And \u201c[w]hen the\ngovernment physically takes possession of an interest in\nproperty for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty\nto compensate the former owner.\u201d Tahoe-Sierra Preserva-\ntion Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,\n535 U. S. 302, 322 (2002) (citing United States v. Pewee\nCoal Co., 341 U. S. 114, 115 (1951)). These guides are\nfundamental in our Takings Clause jurisprudence. We have\nrecognized, however, that no magic formula enables a\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt to judge, in every case, whether a given government\ninterference with property is a taking. In view of the\nnearly infinite variety of ways in which government ac-\ntions or regulations can affect property interests, the\nCourt has recognized few invariable rules in this area.\n   True, we have drawn some bright lines, notably, the\nrule that a permanent physical occupation of property\nauthorized by government is a taking. Loretto v. Tele-\nprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 426\n(1982). So, too, is a regulation that permanently requires\na property owner to sacrifice all economically beneficial\nuses of his or her land. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal\nCouncil, 505 U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). But aside from the\ncases attended by rules of this order, most takings claims\nturn on situation-specific factual inquiries. See Penn\nCentral, 438 U. S., at 124. With this in mind, we turn to\nthe question presented here\u2014whether temporary flooding\ncan ever give rise to a takings claim.\n   The Court first ruled that government-induced flooding\ncan constitute a taking in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13\nWall. 166 (1872). The Wisconsin Legislature had author-\nized the defendant to build a dam which led to the creation\nof a lake, permanently submerging the plaintiff\u2019s land.\nThe defendant argued that the land had not been taken\nbecause the government did not exercise the right of emi-\nnent domain to acquire title to the affected property.\nMoreover, the defendant urged, the damage was merely\n\u201ca consequential result\u201d of the dam\u2019s construction near the\nplaintiff\u2019s property. Id., at 177. Rejecting that crabbed\nreading of the Takings Clause, the Court held that \u201cwhere\nreal estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions\nof water, earth, sand, or other material . . . so as to effec-\ntually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking,\nwithin the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d Id., at 181.\n   Following Pumpelly, the Court recognized that season-\nally recurring flooding could constitute a taking. United\n8   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316 (1917), involved the Gov-\nernment\u2019s construction of a lock and dam, which subjected\nthe plaintiff\u2019s land to \u201cintermittent but inevitably recur-\nring overflows.\u201d Id., at 328. The Court held that the\nregularly recurring flooding gave rise to a takings claim\nno less valid than the claim of an owner whose land was\ncontinuously kept under water. Id., at 328\u2013329.\n   Furthermore, our decisions confirm that takings tem-\nporary in duration can be compensable. This principle\nwas solidly established in the World War II era, when\n\u201c[c]ondemnation for indefinite periods of occupancy [took\nhold as] a practical response to the uncertainties of the\nGovernment\u2019s needs in wartime.\u201d United States v. West-\ninghouse Elec. & Mfg. Co., 339 U. S. 261, 267 (1950). In\nsupport of the war effort, the Government took temporary\npossession of many properties. These exercises of gov-\nernment authority, the Court recognized, qualified as\ncompensable temporary takings. See Pewee Coal Co., 341\nU. S. 114; Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U. S.\n1 (1949); United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S.\n373 (1945). Notably in relation to the question before us,\nthe takings claims approved in these cases were not con-\nfined to instances in which the Government took outright\nphysical possession of the property involved. A temporary\ntakings claim could be maintained as well when govern-\nment action occurring outside the property gave rise to \u201ca\ndirect and immediate interference with the enjoyment and\nuse of the land.\u201d United States v. Causby, 328 U. S.\n256, 266 (1946) (frequent overflights from a nearby airport\nresulted in a taking, for the flights deprived the property\nowner of the customary use of his property as a chicken\nfarm); cf. United States v. Dickinson, 331 U. S. 745, 751\n(1947) (flooding of claimant\u2019s land was a taking even\nthough claimant successfully \u201creclaimed most of his land\nwhich the Government originally took by flooding\u201d).\n   Ever since, we have rejected the argument that govern-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment action must be permanent to qualify as a taking.\nOnce the government\u2019s actions have worked a taking of\nproperty, \u201cno subsequent action by the government can re-\nlieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the pe-\nriod during which the taking was effective.\u201d First English,\n482 U. S., at 321. See also Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U. S., at 337\n(\u201c[W]e do not hold that the temporary nature of a land-use\nrestriction precludes finding that it effects a taking; we\nsimply recognize that it should not be given exclusive\nsignificance one way or the other.\u201d).\n   Because government-induced flooding can constitute a\ntaking of property, and because a taking need not be\npermanent to be compensable, our precedent indicates\nthat government-induced flooding of limited duration may\nbe compensable. No decision of this Court authorizes\na blanket temporary-flooding exception to our Takings\nClause jurisprudence, and we decline to create such an\nexception in this case.\n                              III\n  In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Gov-\nernment relies primarily on Sanguinetti, 264 U. S. 146.\nThat case involved a canal constructed by the Government\nconnecting a slough and a river. The claimant\u2019s land was\npositioned between the slough and the river above the\ncanal. The year after the canal\u2019s construction, a \u201cflood of\nunprecedented severity\u201d caused the canal to overflow onto\nthe claimant\u2019s land; less severe flooding and overflow\noccurred in later years. Id., at 147.\n  The Court held there was no taking on these facts. This\noutcome rested on settled principles of foreseeability and\ncausation. The Court emphasized that the Government\ndid not intend to flood the land or have \u201cany reason to\nexpect that such [a] result would follow\u201d from construction\nof the canal. Id., at 148. Moreover, the property was\nsubject to seasonal flooding prior to the construction of the\n10 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncanal, and the landowner failed to show a causal connec-\ntion between the canal and the increased flooding, which\nmay well have been occasioned by changes in weather\npatterns. See id., at 149 (characterizing the causal rela-\ntionship asserted by the landowner as \u201cpurely conjec-\ntural\u201d). These case-specific features were more than\nsufficient to dispose of the property owner\u2019s claim.\n   In the course of the Sanguinetti decision, however, the\nCourt summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the\nproposition that \u201cin order to create an enforceable liability\nagainst the Government, it is, at least, necessary that the\noverflow be the direct result of the structure, and consti-\ntute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d Ibid.\nThe Government would have us extract from this state-\nment a definitive rule that there can be no temporary\ntaking caused by floods.\n   We do not read so much into the word \u201cpermanent\u201d as it\nappears in a nondispositive sentence in Sanguinetti. That\ncase, we note, was decided in 1924, well before the World\nWar II-era cases and First English, in which the Court\nfirst homed in on the matter of compensation for tempo-\nrary takings. That time factor, we think, renders under-\nstandable the Court\u2019s passing reference to permanence. If\nthe Court indeed meant to express a general limitation on\nthe Takings Clause, that limitation has been superseded\nby subsequent developments in our jurisprudence.\n   There is certainly no suggestion in Sanguinetti that\nflooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of\ntakings claims. The sentence in question was composed to\nsummarize the flooding cases the Court had encountered\nup to that point, which had unexceptionally involved\npermanent, rather than temporary, government-induced\nflooding. 264 U. S., at 149. See Cress, 243 U. S., at 328;\nUnited States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 469 (1903). But as\njust explained, no distinction between permanent and\ntemporary flooding was material to the result in San-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguinetti. We resist reading a single sentence unnecessary\nto the decision as having done so much work. In this re-\ngard, we recall Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s sage observation\nthat \u201cgeneral expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken\nin connection with the case in which those expressions are\nused. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected,\nbut ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit\nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Cohens v.\nVirginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399 (1821).\n   The Government also asserts that the Court in Loretto\ninterpreted Sanguinetti the same way the Federal Circuit\ndid in this case. That assertion bears careful inspection.\nA section of the Court\u2019s opinion in Loretto discussing\npermanent physical occupations parenthetically quotes\nSanguinetti\u2019s statement that flooding is a taking if it\nconstitutes an \u201cactual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d\n458 U. S., at 428. But the first rule of case law as well as\nstatutory interpretation is: Read on. Later in the Loretto\nopinion, the Court clarified that it scarcely intended to\nadopt a \u201cflooding-is-different\u201d rule by the obscure means of\nquoting parenthetically a fragment from a 1924 opinion.\nThe Court distinguished permanent physical occupations\nfrom temporary invasions of property, expressly including\nflooding cases, and said that \u201ctemporary limitations are\nsubject to a more complex balancing process to determine\nwhether they are a taking.\u201d Id., at 435, n. 12.\n   There is thus no solid grounding in precedent for set-\nting flooding apart from all other government intrusions on\nproperty. And the Government has presented no other\npersuasive reason to do so. Its primary argument is of the\nin for a penny, in for a pound genre: reversing the decision\nbelow, the Government worries, risks disruption of pub-\nlic works dedicated to flood control. \u201c[E]very passing\nflood attributable to the government\u2019s operation of a flood-\ncontrol project, no matter how brief,\u201d the Government\nhypothesizes, might qualify as a compensable taking.\n12 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for United States 29. To reject a categorical bar to\ntemporary-flooding takings claims, however, is scarcely\nto credit all, or even many, such claims. It is of course in-\ncumbent on courts to weigh carefully the relevant factors\nand circumstances in each case, as instructed by our deci-\nsions. See infra, at 14.\n  The slippery slope argument, we note, is hardly novel or\nunique to flooding cases. Time and again in Takings\nClause cases, the Court has heard the prophecy that rec-\nognizing a just compensation claim would unduly impede\nthe government\u2019s ability to act in the public interest.\nCausby, 328 U. S., at 275 (Black, J., dissenting); Loretto,\n458 U. S., at 455 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). We have\nrejected this argument when deployed to urge blanket\nexemptions from the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction.\nWhile we recognize the importance of the public interests\nthe Government advances in this case, we do not see them\nas categorically different from the interests at stake in\nmyriad other Takings Clause cases. The sky did not fall\nafter Causby, and today\u2019s modest decision augurs no del-\nuge of takings liability.\n  Tellingly, the Government qualifies its defense of the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s exclusion of flood invasions from tempo-\nrary takings analysis. It sensibly acknowledges that a\ntaking might be found where there is a \u201csufficiently pro-\nlonged series of nominally temporary but substantively\nidentical deviations.\u201d Brief for United States 21. This\nconcession is in some tension with the categorical rule\nadopted by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, once it is recog-\nnized that at least some repeated nonpermanent flooding\ncan amount to a taking of property, the question presented\nto us has been essentially answered. Flooding cases, like\nother takings cases, should be assessed with reference\nto the \u201cparticular circumstances of each case,\u201d and not by\nresorting to blanket exclusionary rules.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201339; Brief for United\nStates 26\u201327. \u201c[M]indful that we are a court of review,\nnot of first view,\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709,\n718, n. 7 (2005), we express no opinion on the proposed\nupstream/downstream distinction and confine our opinion\nto the issue explored and decided by the Federal Circuit.\n   For the same reason, we are not equipped to address the\nbearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.1\nThe determination whether a taking has occurred includes\nconsideration of the property owner\u2019s distinct investment-\nbacked expectations, a matter often informed by the law in\nforce in the State in which the property is located. Lucas,\n505 U. S., at 1027\u20131029; Phillips v. Washington Legal\nFoundation, 524 U. S. 156, 164 (1998). But Arkansas law\nwas not examined by the Federal Circuit, and therefore is\nnot properly pursued in this Court. Whether arguments\nfor an upstream/downstream distinction and on the rele-\nvance of Arkansas law have been preserved and, if so,\nwhether they have merit, are questions appropriately\naddressed to the Court of Appeals on remand. See Glover\nv. United States, 531 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             IV \n\n   We rule today, simply and only, that government-\ninduced flooding temporary in duration gains no auto-\nmatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection. When\nregulation or temporary physical invasion by government\ninterferes with private property, our decisions recognize,\ntime is indeed a factor in determining the existence\nvel non of a compensable taking. See Loretto, 458 U. S.,\nat 435, n. 12 (temporary physical invasions should be as-\nsessed by case-specific factual inquiry); Tahoe-Sierra, 535\nU. S., at 342 (duration of regulatory restriction is a factor\nfor court to consider); National Bd. of YMCA v. United\nStates, 395 U. S. 85, 93 (1969) (\u201ctemporary, unplanned\noccupation\u201d of building by troops under exigent circum-\nstances is not a taking).\n   Also relevant to the takings inquiry is the degree to\nwhich the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result\nof authorized government action. See supra, at 9; John\nHorstmann Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 138, 146 (1921)\n(no takings liability when damage caused by government\naction could not have been foreseen). See also Ridge Line,\nInc. v. United States, 346 F. 3d 1346, 1355\u20131356 (CA Fed.\n2003); In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R. Co.,\n799 F. 2d 317, 325\u2013326 (CA7 1986). So, too, are the char-\nacter of the land at issue and the owner\u2019s \u201creasonable\ninvestment-backed expectations\u201d regarding the land\u2019s use.\nPalazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 618 (2001). For\nexample, the Management Area lies in a floodplain below\na dam, and had experienced flooding in the past. But the\ntrial court found the Area had not been exposed to flooding\ncomparable to the 1990\u2019s accumulations in any other time\nspan either prior to or after the construction of the Dam.\nSee supra, at 4\u20135. Severity of the interference figures in\nthe calculus as well. See Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 130\u2013\n131; Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United\nStates, 260 U. S. 327, 329\u2013330 (1922) (\u201c[W]hile a single act\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

In this regard, the\ncourt noted the Commission\u2019s repeated complaints to\nthe Corps about the destructive impact of the successive\nplanned deviations from the Water Control Manual.\nFurther, the court determined that the interference with\nthe Commission\u2019s property was severe: The Commission\nhad been deprived of the customary use of the Manage-\nment Area as a forest and wildlife preserve, as the bottom-\nland hardwood forest turned, over time, into a \u201cheadwater\nswamp.\u201d 87 Fed. Cl., at 610 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see supra, at 5.2\n   The Government, however, challenged several of the\ntrial court\u2019s factfindings, including those relating to causa-\ntion, foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of\ndamages. Because the Federal Circuit rested its decision\nentirely on the temporary duration of the flooding, it did\nnot address those challenges. As earlier noted, see supra,\nat 13, preserved issues remain open for consideration on\nremand.\n                       *    *      *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Commission is endeavoring to reclaim the land through a resto-\nration program.

Argued October 3, 2012\u2014Decided December 4, 2012\nPetitioner, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (Commission), owns\n  and manages the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management\n  Area (Management Area or Area), which comprises 23,000 acres\n  along the Black River that are forested with multiple hardwood oak\n  species and serve as a venue for recreation and hunting. In 1948, the\n  U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructed the Clearwater\n  Dam (Dam) upstream from the Management Area and adopted a\n  plan known as the Water Control Manual (Manual), which sets sea-\n  sonally varying rates for the release of water from the Dam. Periodi-\n  cally from 1993 until 2000, the Corps, at the request of farmers, au-\n  thorized deviations from the Manual that extended flooding into the\n  Management Area\u2019s peak timber growing season. The Commission\n  objected to the deviations on the ground that they adversely impacted\n  the Management Area, and opposed the Corps\u2019 proposal to make the\n  temporary deviations part of the Manual\u2019s permanent water-release\n  plan. After testing the effect of the deviations, the Corps abandoned\n  the proposed Manual revision and ceased its temporary deviations.\n    The Commission sued the United States, alleging that the tempo-\n  rary deviations constituted a taking of property that entitled the\n  Commission to compensation. The Commission maintained that the\n  deviations caused sustained flooding during tree-growing season, and\n  that the cumulative impact of the flooding caused the destruction of\n  timber in the Area and a substantial change in the character of the\n  terrain, necessitating costly reclamation measures. The Court of\n  Federal Claims\u2019 judgment in favor of the Commission was reversed\n  by the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that\n  temporary government action may give rise to a takings claim if\n2     ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    permanent action of the same character would constitute a taking. It\n    held, however, that government-induced flooding can give rise to a\n    taking claim only if the flooding is \u201cpermanent or inevitably recur-\n    ring.\u201d The Federal Circuit understood this conclusion to be dictated\n    by Sanguinetti v. United States, 264 U. S. 146, 150, and United States\n    v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 328.\nHeld: Government-induced flooding temporary in duration gains no\n automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection. Pp. 6\u201315.\n    (a) No magic formula enables a court to judge, in every case,\n whether a given government interference with property is a taking.\n This Court has drawn some bright lines, but in the main, takings\n claims turn on situation-specific factual inquiries. See Penn Central\n Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124.\n    As to the question whether temporary flooding can ever give rise to\n a takings claim, this Court has ruled that government-induced flood-\n ing, Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88448\"><a href=\"/scotus/shY/pumpelly-v-green-bay-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and seasonally recur-\n ring flooding, Cress, 243 U. S., at 328, can constitute takings. The\n Court has also ruled that takings temporary in duration can be com-\n pensable. E.g., United States v. Causby, 328 U. S. 256, 266. This\n Court\u2019s precedent thus indicates that government-induced flooding of\n limited duration may be compensable. None of the Court\u2019s decisions\n authorizes a blanket temporary-flooding exception to the Court\u2019s Tak-\n ings Clause jurisprudence, and the Court declines to create such an\n exception in this case. Pp. 6\u20139.\n    (b) In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Government\n relies primarily on Sanguinetti, 264 U. S. 146, which held that no\n taking occurred when a government-constructed canal overflowed on-\n to the claimant\u2019s land. In its opinion, the Court summarized prior\n flooding cases as standing for the proposition that \u201cin order to create\n an enforceable liability against the Government, it is, at least, neces-\n sary that the overflow be the direct result of the structure, and con-\n stitute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d Id., at 149. The\n Government urges the Court to extract from the quoted words a de-\n finitive rule that there can be no temporary taking caused by floods.\n But the Court does not read the passing reference to permanence in\n Sanguinetti as having done so much work. Sanguinetti was decided\n in 1924, well before the World War II-era cases and First English\n Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles,\n 482 U. S. 304, in which the Court first homed in on the matter of\n compensation for temporary takings. There is no suggestion in San-\n guinetti that flooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of\n takings claims.\n    The Court thus finds no solid grounding in precedent for setting\n flooding apart from other government intrusions on property. And\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so.\n  Its primary argument is that reversing the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision\n  risks disrupting public works dedicated to flood control. While the\n  public interests here are important, they are not categorically differ-\n  ent from the interests at stake in myriad other Takings Clause cases\n  in which this Court has rejected similar arguments when deployed to\n  urge blanket exemptions from the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction.\n     The Government argues in the alternative that damage to down-\n  stream property, however foreseeable, is collateral or incidental; it is\n  not aimed at any particular landowner and therefore is not compen-\n  sable under the Takings Clause. The Court expresses no opinion on\n  this claim, which was first tendered at oral argument and not aired\n  in the courts below. For the same reason, the Court declines to ad-\n  dress the bearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n     (c) When regulation or temporary physical invasion by government\n  interferes with private property, time is a factor in determining the\n  existence vel non of a compensable taking. See, e.g., Loretto v. Tele-\n  prompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 435, n. 12. Also rel-\n  evant to the takings inquiry is the degree to which the invasion is in-\n  tended or is the foreseeable result of authorized government action.\n  See, e.g., John Horstmann Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 138, 146.\n  So, too, are the character of the land at issue and the owner\u2019s \u201crea-\n  sonable investment-backed expectations\u201d regarding the land\u2019s use,\n  Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 618, as well as the severity\n  of the interference, see, e.g., Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 130\u2013131. In\n  concluding that the flooding was foreseeable in this case, the Court of\n  Federal Claims noted the Commission\u2019s repeated complaints to the\n  Corps about the destructive impact of the successive planned devia-\n  tions and determined that the interference with the Commission\u2019s\n  property was severe. The Government, however, challenged several\n  of the trial court\u2019s factfindings, including those relating to causation,\n  foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of damages. Because\n  the Federal Circuit rested its decision entirely on the temporary du-\n  ration of the flooding, it did not address those challenges, which re-\n  main open for consideration on remand.

UNITED STATES\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 4, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Periodically from 1993 until 2000, the U. S. Army Corps\nof Engineers (Corps) authorized flooding that extended\ninto the peak growing season for timber on forest land\nowned and managed by petitioner, Arkansas Game and\nFish Commission (Commission). Cumulative in effect, the\nrepeated flooding damaged or destroyed more than 18\nmillion board feet of timber and disrupted the ordinary\nuse and enjoyment of the Commission\u2019s property. The\nCommission sought compensation from the United States\npursuant to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction: \u201c[N]or\nshall private property be taken for public use, without\njust compensation.\u201d The question presented is whether a\ntaking may occur, within the meaning of the Takings\nClause, when government-induced flood invasions, al-\nthough repetitive, are temporary.\n  Ordinarily, this Court\u2019s decisions confirm, if government\naction would qualify as a taking when permanently con-\ntinued, temporary actions of the same character may also\nqualify as a taking. In the instant case, the parties and\n2   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe courts below divided on the appropriate classification\nof temporary flooding. Reversing the judgment of the\nCourt of Federal Claims, which awarded compensation to\nthe Commission, the Federal Circuit held, 2 to 1, that\ncompensation may be sought only when flooding is \u201ca per-\nmanent or inevitably recurring condition, rather than an\ninherently temporary situation.\u201d 637 F. 3d 1366, 1378\n(2011). We disagree and conclude that recurrent flood-\nings, even if of finite duration, are not categorically ex-\nempt from Takings Clause liability.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Commission owns the Dave Donaldson Black River\nWildlife Management Area (Management Area or Area),\nwhich comprises 23,000 acres along both banks of the\nBlack River in northeast Arkansas. The Management\nArea is forested with multiple hardwood timber species\nthat support a variety of wildlife habitats. The Commis-\nsion operates the Management Area as a wildlife and\nhunting preserve, and also uses it as a timber resource,\nconducting regular harvests of timber as part of its forest-\nmanagement efforts. Three types of hardwood oak spe-\ncies\u2014nuttall, overcup, and willow\u2014account for 80 percent\nof the trees in the Management Area. The presence of\nthese hardwood oaks is essential to the Area\u2019s character as\na habitat for migratory birds and as a venue for recreation\nand hunting.\n  The Clearwater Dam (Dam) is located 115 miles up-\nstream from the Management Area. The Corps constructed\nthe Dam in 1948, and shortly thereafter adopted a plan\nknown as the Water Control Manual (Manual) to deter-\nmine the rates at which water would be released from the\nDam. The Manual sets seasonally varying release rates,\nbut permits planned deviations from the prescribed rates\nfor agricultural, recreational, and other purposes.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   In 1993, the Corps approved a planned deviation in\nresponse to requests from farmers. From September to\nDecember 1993, the Corps released water from the Dam at\na slower rate than usual, providing downstream farmers\nwith a longer harvest time. As a result, more water than\nusual accumulated in Clearwater Lake behind the Dam.\nTo reduce the accumulation, the Corps extended the pe-\nriod in which a high amount of water would be released.\nThe Commission maintained this extension yielded down-\nstream flooding in the Management Area, above historical\nnorms, during the tree-growing season, which runs from\nApril to October. If the Corps had released the water\nmore rapidly in the fall of 1993, in accordance with the\nManual and with past practice, there would have been\nshort-term waves of flooding which would have receded\nquickly. The lower rate of release in the fall, however,\nextended the period of flooding well into the following\nspring and summer. While the deviation benefited farm-\ners, it interfered with the Management Area\u2019s tree-\ngrowing season.\n   The Corps adopted similar deviations each year from\n1994 through 2000. The record indicates that the decision\nto deviate from the Manual was made independently in\neach year and that the amount of deviation varied over the\nspan of years. Nevertheless, the result was an unbroken\nstring of annual deviations from the Manual. Each devia-\ntion lowered the rate at which water was released during\nthe fall, which necessitated extension of the release period\ninto the following spring and summer. During this span of\nyears the Corps proposed Manual revisions that would\nhave made its temporary deviations part of the permanent\nwater-release plan. On multiple occasions between 1993\nand 2000, the Commission objected to the temporary\ndeviations and opposed any permanent revision to the\nManual, on the ground that the departures from the tradi-\ntional water-release plan adversely impacted the Man-\n4   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagement Area. Ultimately, the Corps tested the effect of\nthe deviations on the Management Area. It thereupon\nabandoned the proposal to permanently revise the Manual\nand, in 2001, ceased its temporary deviations.\n                              B\n  In 2005, the Commission filed the instant lawsuit\nagainst the United States, claiming that the temporary\ndeviations from the Manual constituted a taking of prop-\nerty that entitled the Commission to compensation. The\nCommission maintained that the deviations caused sus-\ntained flooding of its land during the tree-growing season.\nThe cumulative impact of this flooding over a six-year\nperiod between 1993 and 1999, the Commission alleged,\nresulted in the destruction of timber in the Management\nArea and a substantial change in the character of the\nterrain, which necessitated costly reclamation measures.\nFollowing a trial, the Court of Federal Claims ruled in\nfavor of the Commission and issued an opinion and order\ncontaining detailed findings of fact. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2009).\n  The Court of Federal Claims found that the forests in\nthe Management Area were healthy and flourishing before\nthe flooding that occurred in the 1990\u2019s, and that the\nforests had been sustainably managed for decades under\nthe water-release plan contained in the Manual. Id., at\n631. It further found that the Commission repeatedly\nobjected to the deviations from the Manual and alerted the\nCorps to the detrimental effect the longer period of flood-\ning would have on the hardwood timber in the Manage-\nment Area. Id., at 604.\n  As found by the Court of Federal Claims, the flooding\ncaused by the deviations contrasted markedly with histor-\nical flooding patterns. Between 1949 and 1992, the river\nlevel near the Management Area reached six feet an aver-\nage of 64.7 days per year during the growing season; the\nnumber of such days had been even lower on average\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore the Clearwater Dam was built. Between 1993 and\n1999, however, the river reached the same level an aver-\nage of 91.14 days per year, an increase of more than 40\npercent over the historic average. Although the Manage-\nment Area lies in a floodplain, in no previously recorded\ntime span did comparable flooding patterns occur. Id., at\n607\u2013608. Evidence at trial indicated that half of the nut-\ntall oaks in the Management Area were saturated with\nwater when the river level was at six feet, id., at 608; the\nevidence further indicated that the saturation of the soil\naround the trees\u2019 root systems could persist for weeks even\nafter the flooding had receded. Id., at 627.\n  The court concluded that the Corps\u2019 deviations caused\nsix consecutive years of substantially increased flooding,\nwhich constituted an appropriation of the Commission\u2019s\nproperty, albeit a temporary rather than a permanent\none. Important to this conclusion, the court emphasized\nthe deviations\u2019 cumulative effect. The trees were subject\nto prolonged periods of flooding year after year, which\nreduced the oxygen level in the soil and considerably weak-\nened the trees\u2019 root systems. The repeated annual flood-\ning for six years altered the character of the property to\na much greater extent than would have been shown if\nthe harm caused by one year of flooding were simply multi-\nplied by six. When a moderate drought occurred in 1999\nand 2000, the trees did not have the root systems neces-\nsary to sustain themselves; the result, in the court\u2019s\nwords, was \u201ccatastrophic mortality.\u201d Id., at 632. More\nthan 18 million board feet of timber were destroyed or\ndegraded. Id., at 638\u2013640.\n  This damage altered the character of the Management\nArea. The destruction of the trees led to the invasion of\nundesirable plant species, making natural regeneration of\nthe forests improbable in the absence of reclamation ef-\nforts. Id., at 643. To determine the measure of just\ncompensation, the Court of Federal Claims calculated the\n6   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvalue of the lost timber and the projected cost of the rec-\nlamation and awarded the Commission $5.7 million.\n  The Federal Circuit reversed. It acknowledged that in\ngeneral, temporary government action may give rise to a\ntakings claim if permanent action of the same character\nwould constitute a taking. But it held that \u201ccases involv-\ning flooding and [flowage] easements are different.\u201d 637\nF. 3d, at 1374. Government-induced flooding can give rise\nto a taking claim, the Federal Circuit concluded, only if\nthe flooding is \u201cpermanent or inevitably recurring.\u201d Id.,\nat 1378. The Court of Appeals understood this conclusion\nto be dictated by this Court\u2019s decisions in Sanguinetti v.\nUnited States, 264 U. S. 146, 150 (1924), and United\nStates v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 328 (1917). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the question whether government\nactions that cause repeated floodings must be permanent\nor inevitably recurring to constitute a taking of property.\n566 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n   The Takings Clause is \u201cdesigned to bar Government\nfrom forcing some people alone to bear public burdens\nwhich, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the\npublic as a whole.\u201d Armstrong v. United States, 364 U. S.\n40, 49 (1960). See also First English Evangelical Lutheran\nChurch of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U. S.\n304, 318\u2013319 (1987); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New\nYork City, 438 U. S. 104, 123\u2013125 (1978). And \u201c[w]hen the\ngovernment physically takes possession of an interest in\nproperty for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty\nto compensate the former owner.\u201d Tahoe-Sierra Preserva-\ntion Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,\n535 U. S. 302, 322 (2002) (citing United States v. Pewee\nCoal Co., 341 U. S. 114, 115 (1951)). These guides are\nfundamental in our Takings Clause jurisprudence. We have\nrecognized, however, that no magic formula enables a\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt to judge, in every case, whether a given government\ninterference with property is a taking. In view of the\nnearly infinite variety of ways in which government ac-\ntions or regulations can affect property interests, the\nCourt has recognized few invariable rules in this area.\n   True, we have drawn some bright lines, notably, the\nrule that a permanent physical occupation of property\nauthorized by government is a taking. Loretto v. Tele-\nprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 426\n(1982). So, too, is a regulation that permanently requires\na property owner to sacrifice all economically beneficial\nuses of his or her land. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal\nCouncil, 505 U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992). But aside from the\ncases attended by rules of this order, most takings claims\nturn on situation-specific factual inquiries. See Penn\nCentral, 438 U. S., at 124. With this in mind, we turn to\nthe question presented here\u2014whether temporary flooding\ncan ever give rise to a takings claim.\n   The Court first ruled that government-induced flooding\ncan constitute a taking in Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88448\"><a href=\"/scotus/shY/pumpelly-v-green-bay-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1872). The Wisconsin Legislature had author-\nized the defendant to build a dam which led to the creation\nof a lake, permanently submerging the plaintiff\u2019s land.\nThe defendant argued that the land had not been taken\nbecause the government did not exercise the right of emi-\nnent domain to acquire title to the affected property.\nMoreover, the defendant urged, the damage was merely\n\u201ca consequential result\u201d of the dam\u2019s construction near the\nplaintiff\u2019s property. Id., at 177. Rejecting that crabbed\nreading of the Takings Clause, the Court held that \u201cwhere\nreal estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions\nof water, earth, sand, or other material . . . so as to effec-\ntually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking,\nwithin the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d Id., at 181.\n   Following Pumpelly, the Court recognized that season-\nally recurring flooding could constitute a taking. United\n8   ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316 (1917), involved the Gov-\nernment\u2019s construction of a lock and dam, which subjected\nthe plaintiff\u2019s land to \u201cintermittent but inevitably recur-\nring overflows.\u201d Id., at 328. The Court held that the\nregularly recurring flooding gave rise to a takings claim\nno less valid than the claim of an owner whose land was\ncontinuously kept under water. Id., at 328\u2013329.\n   Furthermore, our decisions confirm that takings tem-\nporary in duration can be compensable. This principle\nwas solidly established in the World War II era, when\n\u201c[c]ondemnation for indefinite periods of occupancy [took\nhold as] a practical response to the uncertainties of the\nGovernment\u2019s needs in wartime.\u201d United States v. West-\ninghouse Elec. & Mfg. Co., 339 U. S. 261, 267 (1950). In\nsupport of the war effort, the Government took temporary\npossession of many properties. These exercises of gov-\nernment authority, the Court recognized, qualified as\ncompensable temporary takings. See Pewee Coal Co., 341\nU. S. 114; Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U. S.\n1 (1949); United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S.\n373 (1945). Notably in relation to the question before us,\nthe takings claims approved in these cases were not con-\nfined to instances in which the Government took outright\nphysical possession of the property involved. A temporary\ntakings claim could be maintained as well when govern-\nment action occurring outside the property gave rise to \u201ca\ndirect and immediate interference with the enjoyment and\nuse of the land.\u201d United States v. Causby, 328 U. S.\n256, 266 (1946) (frequent overflights from a nearby airport\nresulted in a taking, for the flights deprived the property\nowner of the customary use of his property as a chicken\nfarm); cf. United States v. Dickinson, 331 U. S. 745, 751\n(1947) (flooding of claimant\u2019s land was a taking even\nthough claimant successfully \u201creclaimed most of his land\nwhich the Government originally took by flooding\u201d).\n   Ever since, we have rejected the argument that govern-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment action must be permanent to qualify as a taking.\nOnce the government\u2019s actions have worked a taking of\nproperty, \u201cno subsequent action by the government can re-\nlieve it of the duty to provide compensation for the pe-\nriod during which the taking was effective.\u201d First English,\n482 U. S., at 321. See also Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U. S., at 337\n(\u201c[W]e do not hold that the temporary nature of a land-use\nrestriction precludes finding that it effects a taking; we\nsimply recognize that it should not be given exclusive\nsignificance one way or the other.\u201d).\n   Because government-induced flooding can constitute a\ntaking of property, and because a taking need not be\npermanent to be compensable, our precedent indicates\nthat government-induced flooding of limited duration may\nbe compensable. No decision of this Court authorizes\na blanket temporary-flooding exception to our Takings\nClause jurisprudence, and we decline to create such an\nexception in this case.\n                              III\n  In advocating a temporary-flooding exception, the Gov-\nernment relies primarily on Sanguinetti, 264 U. S. 146.\nThat case involved a canal constructed by the Government\nconnecting a slough and a river. The claimant\u2019s land was\npositioned between the slough and the river above the\ncanal. The year after the canal\u2019s construction, a \u201cflood of\nunprecedented severity\u201d caused the canal to overflow onto\nthe claimant\u2019s land; less severe flooding and overflow\noccurred in later years. Id., at 147.\n  The Court held there was no taking on these facts. This\noutcome rested on settled principles of foreseeability and\ncausation. The Court emphasized that the Government\ndid not intend to flood the land or have \u201cany reason to\nexpect that such [a] result would follow\u201d from construction\nof the canal. Id., at 148. Moreover, the property was\nsubject to seasonal flooding prior to the construction of the\n10 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncanal, and the landowner failed to show a causal connec-\ntion between the canal and the increased flooding, which\nmay well have been occasioned by changes in weather\npatterns. See id., at 149 (characterizing the causal rela-\ntionship asserted by the landowner as \u201cpurely conjec-\ntural\u201d). These case-specific features were more than\nsufficient to dispose of the property owner\u2019s claim.\n   In the course of the Sanguinetti decision, however, the\nCourt summarized prior flooding cases as standing for the\nproposition that \u201cin order to create an enforceable liability\nagainst the Government, it is, at least, necessary that the\noverflow be the direct result of the structure, and consti-\ntute an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d Ibid.\nThe Government would have us extract from this state-\nment a definitive rule that there can be no temporary\ntaking caused by floods.\n   We do not read so much into the word \u201cpermanent\u201d as it\nappears in a nondispositive sentence in Sanguinetti. That\ncase, we note, was decided in 1924, well before the World\nWar II-era cases and First English, in which the Court\nfirst homed in on the matter of compensation for tempo-\nrary takings. That time factor, we think, renders under-\nstandable the Court\u2019s passing reference to permanence. If\nthe Court indeed meant to express a general limitation on\nthe Takings Clause, that limitation has been superseded\nby subsequent developments in our jurisprudence.\n   There is certainly no suggestion in Sanguinetti that\nflooding cases should be set apart from the mine run of\ntakings claims. The sentence in question was composed to\nsummarize the flooding cases the Court had encountered\nup to that point, which had unexceptionally involved\npermanent, rather than temporary, government-induced\nflooding. 264 U. S., at 149. See Cress, 243 U. S., at 328;\nUnited States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 469 (1903). But as\njust explained, no distinction between permanent and\ntemporary flooding was material to the result in San-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nguinetti. We resist reading a single sentence unnecessary\nto the decision as having done so much work. In this re-\ngard, we recall Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s sage observation\nthat \u201cgeneral expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken\nin connection with the case in which those expressions are\nused. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected,\nbut ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit\nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Cohens v.\nVirginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/scotus/rnd/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (1821).\n   The Government also asserts that the Court in Loretto\ninterpreted Sanguinetti the same way the Federal Circuit\ndid in this case. That assertion bears careful inspection.\nA section of the Court\u2019s opinion in Loretto discussing\npermanent physical occupations parenthetically quotes\nSanguinetti\u2019s statement that flooding is a taking if it\nconstitutes an \u201cactual, permanent invasion of the land.\u201d\n458 U. S., at 428. But the first rule of case law as well as\nstatutory interpretation is: Read on. Later in the Loretto\nopinion, the Court clarified that it scarcely intended to\nadopt a \u201cflooding-is-different\u201d rule by the obscure means of\nquoting parenthetically a fragment from a 1924 opinion.\nThe Court distinguished permanent physical occupations\nfrom temporary invasions of property, expressly including\nflooding cases, and said that \u201ctemporary limitations are\nsubject to a more complex balancing process to determine\nwhether they are a taking.\u201d Id., at 435, n. 12.\n   There is thus no solid grounding in precedent for set-\nting flooding apart from all other government intrusions on\nproperty. And the Government has presented no other\npersuasive reason to do so. Its primary argument is of the\nin for a penny, in for a pound genre: reversing the decision\nbelow, the Government worries, risks disruption of pub-\nlic works dedicated to flood control. \u201c[E]very passing\nflood attributable to the government\u2019s operation of a flood-\ncontrol project, no matter how brief,\u201d the Government\nhypothesizes, might qualify as a compensable taking.\n12 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for United States 29. To reject a categorical bar to\ntemporary-flooding takings claims, however, is scarcely\nto credit all, or even many, such claims. It is of course in-\ncumbent on courts to weigh carefully the relevant factors\nand circumstances in each case, as instructed by our deci-\nsions. See infra, at 14.\n  The slippery slope argument, we note, is hardly novel or\nunique to flooding cases. Time and again in Takings\nClause cases, the Court has heard the prophecy that rec-\nognizing a just compensation claim would unduly impede\nthe government\u2019s ability to act in the public interest.\nCausby, 328 U. S., at 275 (Black, J., dissenting); Loretto,\n458 U. S., at 455 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). We have\nrejected this argument when deployed to urge blanket\nexemptions from the Fifth Amendment\u2019s instruction.\nWhile we recognize the importance of the public interests\nthe Government advances in this case, we do not see them\nas categorically different from the interests at stake in\nmyriad other Takings Clause cases. The sky did not fall\nafter Causby, and today\u2019s modest decision augurs no del-\nuge of takings liability.\n  Tellingly, the Government qualifies its defense of the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s exclusion of flood invasions from tempo-\nrary takings analysis. It sensibly acknowledges that a\ntaking might be found where there is a \u201csufficiently pro-\nlonged series of nominally temporary but substantively\nidentical deviations.\u201d Brief for United States 21. This\nconcession is in some tension with the categorical rule\nadopted by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, once it is recog-\nnized that at least some repeated nonpermanent flooding\ncan amount to a taking of property, the question presented\nto us has been essentially answered. Flooding cases, like\nother takings cases, should be assessed with reference\nto the \u201cparticular circumstances of each case,\u201d and not by\nresorting to blanket exclusionary rules.

S. ____ (2012)                 13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(citing Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 416\n(1922)). See Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 124.\n   At oral argument, the Government tendered a different\njustification for the Federal Circuit\u2019s judgment, one not\naired in the courts below, and barely hinted at in the brief\nthe Government filed in this Court: Whether the damage\nis permanent or temporary, damage to downstream prop-\nerty, however foreseeable, is collateral or incidental; it is\nnot aimed at any particular landowner and therefore does\nnot qualify as an occupation compensable under the Tak-\nings Clause. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\u201339; Brief for United\nStates 26\u201327. \u201c[M]indful that we are a court of review,\nnot of first view,\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709,\n718, n. 7 (2005), we express no opinion on the proposed\nupstream/downstream distinction and confine our opinion\nto the issue explored and decided by the Federal Circuit.\n   For the same reason, we are not equipped to address the\nbearing, if any, of Arkansas water-rights law on this case.1\nThe determination whether a taking has occurred includes\nconsideration of the property owner\u2019s distinct investment-\nbacked expectations, a matter often informed by the law in\nforce in the State in which the property is located. Lucas,\n505 U. S., at 1027\u20131029; Phillips v. Washington Legal\nFoundation, 524 U. S. 156, 164 (1998). But Arkansas law\nwas not examined by the Federal Circuit, and therefore is\nnot properly pursued in this Court. Whether arguments\nfor an upstream/downstream distinction and on the rele-\nvance of Arkansas law have been preserved and, if so,\nwhether they have merit, are questions appropriately\naddressed to the Court of Appeals on remand. See Glover\nv. United States, 531 U. S. 198, 205 (2001).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Arkansas water law is barely discussed in the parties\u2019 briefs, see\nBrief for United States 43, but has been urged at length in a brief\namicus curiae filed by Professors of Law Teaching in the Property Law\nand Water Rights Fields.\n14 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             IV \n\n   We rule today, simply and only, that government-\ninduced flooding temporary in duration gains no auto-\nmatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection. When\nregulation or temporary physical invasion by government\ninterferes with private property, our decisions recognize,\ntime is indeed a factor in determining the existence\nvel non of a compensable taking. See Loretto, 458 U. S.,\nat 435, n. 12 (temporary physical invasions should be as-\nsessed by case-specific factual inquiry); Tahoe-Sierra, 535\nU. S., at 342 (duration of regulatory restriction is a factor\nfor court to consider); National Bd. of YMCA v. United\nStates, 395 U. S. 85, 93 (1969) (\u201ctemporary, unplanned\noccupation\u201d of building by troops under exigent circum-\nstances is not a taking).\n   Also relevant to the takings inquiry is the degree to\nwhich the invasion is intended or is the foreseeable result\nof authorized government action. See supra, at 9; John\nHorstmann Co. v. United States, 257 U. S. 138, 146 (1921)\n(no takings liability when damage caused by government\naction could not have been foreseen). See also Ridge Line,\nInc. v. United States, 346 F. 3d 1346, 1355\u20131356 (CA Fed.\n2003); In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R. Co.,\n799 F. 2d 317, 325\u2013326 (CA7 1986). So, too, are the char-\nacter of the land at issue and the owner\u2019s \u201creasonable\ninvestment-backed expectations\u201d regarding the land\u2019s use.\nPalazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U. S. 606, 618 (2001). For\nexample, the Management Area lies in a floodplain below\na dam, and had experienced flooding in the past. But the\ntrial court found the Area had not been exposed to flooding\ncomparable to the 1990\u2019s accumulations in any other time\nspan either prior to or after the construction of the Dam.\nSee supra, at 4\u20135. Severity of the interference figures in\nthe calculus as well. See Penn Central, 438 U. S., at 130\u2013\n131; Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United\nStates, 260 U. S. 327, 329\u2013330 (1922) (\u201c[W]hile a single act\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                 15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nmay not be enough, a continuance of them in sufficient\nnumber and for a sufficient time may prove [a taking].\nEvery successive trespass adds to the force of the\nevidence.\u201d).\n   The Court of Federal Claims found that the flooding the\nCommission assails was foreseeable. In this regard, the\ncourt noted the Commission\u2019s repeated complaints to\nthe Corps about the destructive impact of the successive\nplanned deviations from the Water Control Manual.\nFurther, the court determined that the interference with\nthe Commission\u2019s property was severe: The Commission\nhad been deprived of the customary use of the Manage-\nment Area as a forest and wildlife preserve, as the bottom-\nland hardwood forest turned, over time, into a \u201cheadwater\nswamp.\u201d 87 Fed. Cl., at 610 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see supra, at 5.2\n   The Government, however, challenged several of the\ntrial court\u2019s factfindings, including those relating to causa-\ntion, foreseeability, substantiality, and the amount of\ndamages. Because the Federal Circuit rested its decision\nentirely on the temporary duration of the flooding, it did\nnot address those challenges. As earlier noted, see supra,\nat 13, preserved issues remain open for consideration on\nremand.\n                       *    *      *\n  For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Commission is endeavoring to reclaim the land through a resto-\nration program. The prospect of reclamation, however, does not dis-\nqualify a landowner from receipt of just compensation for a taking.\nUnited States v. Dickinson, 331 U. S. 745, 751 (1947).\n16 ARKANSAS GAME AND FISH COMM\u2019N v. UNITED STATES\n\n                  Opinion of the Court\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n</pre>",
