SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11\u2013184.      Argued October 2, 2012\u2014Decided December 10, 2012\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) permits a federal employ-\n  ee subjected to a particularly serious personnel action such as a dis-\n  charge or demotion to appeal her agency\u2019s decision to the Merit Sys-\n  tems Protection Board (MSPB or Board). Such an appeal may allege\n  that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the\n  CSRA itself; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency\n  with discrimination prohibited by a federal statute. See 5 U. S. C.\n  \u00a77702(a)(1). When an employee alleges that a personnel action ap-\n  pealable to the MSPB was based on discrimination, her case is known\n  as a \u201cmixed case.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302. Mixed cases are governed\n  by special procedures set out in the CSRA and regulations of the\n  MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n     Under those procedures, an employee may initiate a mixed case by\n  filing a discrimination complaint with the agency. If the agency de-\n  cides against the employee, she may either appeal the agency\u2019s deci-\n  sion to the MSPB or sue the agency in district court. Alternatively,\n  the employee can bypass the agency and bring her mixed case direct-\n  ly to the MSPB. If the MSPB upholds the personnel action, whether\n  in the first instance or after the agency has done so, the employee is\n  entitled to seek judicial review.\n     Section 7703(b)(1) of the CSRA provides that petitions for review of\n  MSPB decisions \u201cshall be filed in the . . . Federal Circuit,\u201d except as\n  provided in \u00a77703(b)(2). Section 7703(b)(2) instructs that \u201c[c]ases of\n  discrimination subject to the provisions of [\u00a77702] shall be filed under\n  [the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute].\u201d\n  Those enforcement provisions all authorize suit in federal district\n  court. The \u201ccases of discrimination subject to the provisions of \u00a77702\u201d\n  are those in which an employee \u201c(A) has been affected by an action\n2                         KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB], and (B) alleges that a basis\n    for the action was discrimination prohibited by\u201d a listed federal stat-\n    ute; in other words, \u201cmixed cases.\u201d\n      In 2005, while an employee of the Department of Labor (DOL or\n    agency), petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner filed a complaint with the\n    agency\u2019s civil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in unlaw-\n    ful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work en-\n    vironment. Following applicable EEOC regulations, DOL completed\n    an internal investigation and report, and Kloeckner requested a\n    hearing before an EEOC administrative judge. While the EEOC case\n    was pending, Kloeckner was fired. Because Kloeckner believed that\n    DOL\u2019s decision to fire her was based on unlawful discrimination, she\n    now had a \u201cmixed case.\u201d Kloeckner originally brought her mixed case\n    directly to the MSPB. Concerned about duplicative discovery ex-\n    penses between her EEOC and MSPB cases, she moved to amend her\n    EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and\n    asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four\n    months to allow the EEOC process to go forward. Both motions were\n    granted. In September 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal with-\n    out prejudice to her right to refile by January 18, 2007. The EEOC\n    case, however, continued until April 2007, when the EEOC judge\n    terminated the proceeding as a sanction for Kloeckner\u2019s bad-faith\n    discovery conduct and returned the case to DOL for a final decision.\n    In October, DOL ruled against Kloeckner on all of her claims.\n    Kloeckner appealed to the Board in November 2007. The Board dis-\n    missed Kloeckner\u2019s appeal as untimely, viewing it as an effort to reo-\n    pen her old MSPB case months after the January 18 deadline.\n      Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District\n    Court, alleging unlawful discrimination. The court dismissed the\n    complaint for lack of jurisdiction. It held that, because the MSPB\n    dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s claims on procedural grounds, she should have\n    sought review in the Federal Circuit under \u00a77703(b)(1); in the court\u2019s\n    view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pur-\n    suant to \u00a77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits.\n    The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable\n to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in\n \u00a77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not the Fed-\n eral Circuit, regardless whether the MSPB decided her case on pro-\n cedural grounds or on the merits. Pp. 7\u201314.\n    (a) Two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like\n Kloeckner to district court. Begin with \u00a7 7703, which governs judicial\n review of MSPB rulings. Section 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to\n review the Board\u2019s final decisions should be filed in the Federal Cir-\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cuit\u2014\u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d Sec-\n  tion 7703(b)(2) then provides that \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to\n  the provisions of [\u00a77702]\u201d \u201cshall be filed under\u201d the enforcement pro-\n  vision of a listed antidiscrimination statute. Each of the referenced\n  enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.\n  Thus, \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [\u00a77702]\u201d\n  shall be filed in district court. Turn next to \u00a77702, which provides\n  that the cases \u201csubject to [its] provisions\u201d are cases in which a federal\n  employee \u201chas been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to\n  the [MSPB],\u201d and \u201calleges that a basis for the action was discrimina-\n  tion prohibited by\u201d a listed federal statute. The \u201ccases of discrimina-\n  tion subject to\u201d \u00a77702 are therefore mixed cases. Putting \u00a77703 and\n  \u00a77702 together, mixed cases shall be filed in district court. That is\n  where Kloeckner\u2019s case should have been, and indeed was, filed. Re-\n  gardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or\n  threw it out as untimely, she brought the kind of case that the CSRA\n  routes to district court. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (b) The Government\u2019s alternative view\u2014that the CSRA directs the\n  MSPB\u2019s merits decisions to district court, while channeling its proce-\n  dural rulings to the Federal Circuit\u2014is not supported by the statute.\n  According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not\n  specifically prescribed in the CSRA, lies hidden in the statute\u2019s tim-\n  ing requirements. But the Government cannot explain why Congress\n  would have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.\n  And taking the Government\u2019s analysis one step at a time makes it no\n  more plausible.

KLOECKNER, PETITIONER v. HILDA L.\n        SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 10, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal employee subjected to an adverse personnel\naction such as a discharge or demotion may appeal her\nagency\u2019s decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board\n(MSPB or Board). See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77512, 7701. In that\nchallenge, the employee may claim, among other things,\nthat the agency discriminated against her in violation of a\nfederal statute. See \u00a77702(a)(1). The question presented\nin this case arises when the MSPB dismisses an appeal\nalleging discrimination not on the merits, but on proce-\ndural grounds. Should an employee seeking judicial re-\nview then file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit, or instead bring a suit in district court\nunder the applicable antidiscrimination law? We hold she\nshould go to district court.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101 et seq., establishes a framework for evaluating per-\nsonnel actions taken against federal employees. That\nstatutory framework provides graduated procedural pro-\n2                     KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntections depending on an action\u2019s severity. If (but only if )\nthe action is particularly serious\u2014involving, for example,\na removal from employment or a reduction in grade or\npay\u2014the affected employee has a right to appeal the\nagency\u2019s decision to the MSPB, an independent adjudica-\ntor of federal employment disputes.1 See \u00a7\u00a71204, 7512,\n7701. Such an appeal may merely allege that the agency\nhad insufficient cause for taking the action under the\nCSRA; but the appeal may also or instead charge the\nagency with discrimination prohibited by another federal\nstatute, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., or the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a77702(a)(1). When an employee complains of\na personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB\nand alleges that the action was based on discrimination,\nshe is said (by pertinent regulation) to have brought a\n\u201cmixed case.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302 (2012). The CSRA\nand regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) set out special proce-\ndures to govern such a case\u2014different from those used\nwhen the employee either challenges a serious personnel\naction under the CSRA alone or attacks a less serious\naction as discriminatory. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77702, 7703(b)(2)\n(2006 ed. and Supp. V); 5 CFR pt. 1201, subpt. E (2012);\n29 CFR pt. 1614, subpt. C.\n  A federal employee bringing a mixed case may pro-\nceed in a variety of ways. She may first file a discrim-\nination complaint with the agency itself, much as an\nemployee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to\nthe MSPB could do. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a); 29 CFR\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Theactions entitling an employee to appeal a case to the MSPB\ninclude \u201c(1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than 14 days; (3) a\nreduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough.\u201d 5\nU. S. C. \u00a77512.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71614.302(b). If the agency decides against her, the em-\nployee may then either take the matter to the MSPB or\nbypass further administrative review by suing the agency\nin district court. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(b); 29 CFR\n\u00a71614.302(d)(1)(i). Alternatively, the employee may initi-\nate the process by bringing her case directly to the MSPB,\nforgoing the agency\u2019s own system for evaluating discrimi-\nnation charges.      See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a); 29 CFR\n\u00a71614.302(b). If the MSPB upholds the personnel action\n(whether in the first instance or after the agency has done\nso), the employee again has a choice: She may request\nadditional administrative process, this time with the\nEEOC, or else she may seek judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77702(a)(3), (b); 5 CFR \u00a71201.161; 29 CFR \u00a71614.303.\nThe question in this case concerns where that judicial\nreview should take place.\n   Section 7703 of the CSRA governs judicial review of the\nMSPB\u2019s decisions. Section 7703(b)(1) gives the basic rule:\n\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a\npetition to review a . . . final decision of the Board shall be\nfiled in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit.\u201d Section 7703(b)(2) then spells out the exception:\n    \u201cCases of discrimination subject to the provisions of\n    section 7702 of this title shall be filed under [the\n    enforcement sections of the Civil Rights Act, Age\n    Discrimination in Employment Act, and Fair Labor\n    Standards Act], as applicable. Notwithstanding any\n    other provision of law, any such case filed under any\n    such section must be filed within 30 days after the\n    date the individual filing the case received notice of\n    the judicially reviewable action under such section\n    7702.\u201d\nThe enforcement provisions of the antidiscrimination\nstatutes listed in this exception all authorize suit in fed-\neral district court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u201316(c), 2000e\u2013\n4                   KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n5(f ); 29 U. S. C. \u00a7633a(c); \u00a7216(b); see also Elgin v. De-\npartment of Treasury, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at\n9\u201310).\n  Section 7702 describes and provides for the \u201ccases of\ndiscrimination\u201d referenced in \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception. In\nrelevant part, \u00a77702(a)(1) states:\n    \u201c[I]n the case of any employee . . . who\u2014\n       \u201c(A) has been affected by an action which the em-\n       ployee . . . may appeal to the Merit Systems Protec-\n       tion Board, and\n       \u201c(B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimi-\n       nation prohibited by [specified antidiscrimination\n       statutes],\n    \u201cthe Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the\n    appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and\n    the appealable action in accordance with the Board\u2019s\n    appellate procedures.\u201d\nThe \u201ccases of discrimination\u201d in \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception, in\nother words, are mixed cases, in which an employee chal-\nlenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to\nthe MSPB.\n  The parties here dispute whether, in light of these in-\nterwoven statutory provisions, an employee should go to\nthe Federal Circuit (pursuant to the general rule of\n\u00a77703(b)(1)), or instead to a district court (pursuant to the\nexception in \u00a77703(b)(2)), when the MSPB has dismissed\nher mixed case on procedural grounds.\n                               B\n  Petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner used to work at the De-\npartment of Labor (DOL or agency). In June 2005, while\nstill an employee, she filed a complaint with the agency\u2019s\ncivil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in un-\nlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to\na hostile work environment. At that point, Kloeckner\u2019s\ncase was not appealable to the MSPB because she had not\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsuffered a sufficiently serious personnel action (e.g., a\nremoval or demotion). See supra, at 1\u20132. Her claim thus\nwent forward not under the special procedures for mixed\ncases, but under the EEOC\u2019s regulations for all other\ncharges of discrimination. See 29 CFR pt. 1614, subpts.\nA, D. In line with those rules, the agency completed an\ninternal investigation and report in June 2006, and\nKloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC adminis-\ntrative judge.\n  The next month, DOL fired Kloeckner. A removal from\nemployment is appealable to the MSPB, see supra, at 1\u20132,\nand Kloeckner believed the agency\u2019s action was discrimi-\nnatory; she therefore now had a mixed case. As permitted\nby regulation, see supra, at 3, she initially elected to file\nthat case with the MSPB. Her claim of discriminatory\nremoval, however, raised issues similar to those in her\nhostile work environment case, now pending before an\nEEOC judge; as a result, she became concerned that she\nwould incur duplicative discovery expenses. To address\nthat problem, she sought leave to amend her EEOC com-\nplaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal, and\nshe asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice\nfor four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward.\nSee App. 13, 50\u201351. Both of those motions were granted.\nThe EEOC judge accepted the amendment,2 and on Sep-\ntember 18, 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal \u201cwithout\nprejudice to [her] right to refile . . . either (A) within 30\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Neither the CSRA nor any regulation explicitly authorizes an EEOC\n\njudge to consider the legality of a removal or other serious personnel\naction before the Board has done so. See supra, at 2\u20133. Nonetheless,\nthe EEOC has approved that approach when the issues the personnel\naction raises are \u201cfirmly enmeshed\u201d in an ongoing EEOC proceeding in\norder to avoid \u201cdelay[ing] justice and creat[ing] unnecessary proce-\ndural complications.\u201d Burton v. Espy, Appeal No. 01932449, 1994 WL\n748214, *12 (EEOC, Oct. 28, 1994); see also Myvett v. Poteat, Appeal\nNo. 0120103671, 2011 WL 6122516, *2 (EEOC, Nov. 21, 2011). We\nexpress no view on the propriety of this practice.\n6                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndays after a decision is rendered in her EEOC case; or (B)\nby January 18, 2007\u2014whichever occurs first.\u201d Id., at 5.\n  Discovery continued in the EEOC proceeding well past\nthe MSPB\u2019s January 18 deadline. In April, the EEOC\njudge found that Kloeckner had engaged in bad-faith\nconduct in connection with discovery. As a sanction, the\njudge terminated the EEOC proceeding and returned\nKloeckner\u2019s case to DOL for a final decision. Six months\nlater, in October 2007, DOL issued a ruling rejecting all of\nKloeckner\u2019s claims. See id., at 10\u201349.\n  Kloeckner appealed DOL\u2019s decision to the Board in\nNovember 2007. That appeal was filed within 30 days,\nthe usual window for seeking MSPB review of an agency\u2019s\ndetermination of a mixed case. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a);\n29 CFR \u00a71614.302(d)(1)(ii). But the MSPB declined to\ntreat Kloeckner\u2019s filing as an ordinary appeal of such an\nagency decision. Instead, the Board viewed it as an effort\nto reopen her old MSPB case\u2014many months after the\nJanuary 18 deadline for doing so had expired. The Board\ntherefore dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s appeal as untimely. See\nApp. 53\u201357.\n  Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in\nFederal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination.\nThe District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of\njurisdiction. See Kloeckner v. Solis, Civ. Action No.\n4:09CV804 (ED Mo., Feb. 18, 2010). Relying on the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s ruling in Brumley v. Levinson, 991 F. 2d\n801 (1993) (per curiam), the court held that because the\nMSPB had dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s claims on procedural\ngrounds, she should have sought review in the Federal\nCircuit under \u00a77703(b)(1); in the court\u2019s view, the only\ndiscrimination cases that could go to district court pursu-\nant to \u00a77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on\nthe merits. The Eighth Circuit affirmed on the same\nreasoning. See 639 F. 3d 834 (2011).\n  We granted certiorari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial\nreview should proceed in the Federal Circuit or in a dis-\ntrict court when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case\non procedural grounds.3 We now reverse the Eighth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision.\n                              II\n   As the above account reveals, the intersection of fed-\neral civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced\na complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving\nclaims of discrimination in the federal workplace. But\neven within the most intricate and complex systems, some\nthings are plain. So it is in this case, where two sections\nof the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeck-\nner to district court.\n   Begin with \u00a77703, which governs judicial review of the\nMSPB\u2019s rulings. As already noted, see supra, at 3\u20134,\n\u00a77703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board\u2019s\nfinal decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit\u2014\n\u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d\nParagraph (2), i.e., \u00a77703(b)(2), then sets out a different\nrule for one category of cases\u2014\u201c[c]ases of discrimination\nsubject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title.\u201d Such\na case, paragraph (2) instructs, \u201cshall be filed under\u201d the\nenforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimina-\ntion statute. And each of those enforcement provisions\nauthorizes an action in federal district court. See supra,\nat 3\u20134. So \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provi-\nsions of section 7702\u201d shall be filed in district court.\n   Turn next to \u00a77702, which identifies the cases \u201csubject\nto [its] provisions.\u201d As also stated earlier, \u00a77702(a)(1) de-\nscribes cases in which a federal employee \u201c(A) has been\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare   639 F. 3d 834 (CA8 2011) (case below) (Federal Circuit);\nBallentine v. MSPB, 738 F. 2d 1244 (CA Fed. 1984) (same), with Harms\nv. IRS, 321 F. 3d 1001 (CA10 2003) (district court); Downey v. Runyon,\n160 F. 3d 139 (CA2 1998) (same).\n8                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naffected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit\nSystems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis\nfor the action was discrimination prohibited by\u201d a listed\nfederal statute. The subsection thus describes what we\n(adopting the lingo of the applicable regulations) have\ncalled \u201cmixed cases.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302. Those are\nthe \u201ccases of discrimination subject to\u201d the rest of \u00a77702\u2019s\nprovisions.\n   Now just put \u00a77703 and \u00a77702 together\u2014say, in the\nform of a syllogism, to make the point obvious. Under\n\u00a77703(b)(2), \u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d\nshall be filed in district court. Under \u00a77702(a)(1), the\n\u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d are mixed\ncases\u2014those appealable to the MSPB and alleging dis-\ncrimination. Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district\ncourt.\n   And so that is where Kloeckner\u2019s case should have been\nfiled (as indeed it was). No one here contests that Kloeck-\nner brought a mixed case\u2014that she was affected by an\naction (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB and that she\nalleged discrimination prohibited by an enumerated fed-\neral law. And under the CSRA\u2019s terms, that is all that\nmatters. Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her\nclaim on the merits or instead threw it out as untimely,\nKloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes,\nin crystalline fashion, to district court.\n                              III\n  The Government offers an alternative view (as did the\nEighth Circuit)\u2014that the CSRA directs the MSPB\u2019s merits\ndecisions to district court, while channeling its procedural\nrulings to the Federal Circuit. According to the Govern-\nment, that bifurcated scheme, though not prescribed in\nthe CSRA in so many words, lies hidden in the statute\u2019s\ntiming requirements. But we return from the Govern-\nment\u2019s mazelike tour of the CSRA persuaded only that the\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits-procedure distinction is a contrivance, found no-\nwhere in the statute\u2019s provisions on judicial review.\n   The Government\u2019s argument has two necessary steps.\nFirst, the Government claims that \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception\nto Federal Circuit jurisdiction applies only when the\nMSPB\u2019s decision in a mixed case is a \u201cjudicially review-\nable action\u201d under \u00a77702. Second, the Government asserts\nthat the Board\u2019s dismissal of a mixed case on procedural\ngrounds does not qualify as such a \u201cjudicially reviewable\naction.\u201d We describe in turn the way the Government\narrives at each of these conclusions.\n   The first step of the Government\u2019s argument derives\nfrom \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s second sentence. Right after stating\nthat \u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d shall be\nfiled under specified antidiscrimination statutes (i.e., shall\nbe filed in district court), \u00a77703(b)(2) provides: \u201cNotwith-\nstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed\nunder any such [statute] must be filed within 30 days\nafter the date the individual filing the case received notice\nof the judicially reviewable action under section 7702.\u201d\nThe Government reads that sentence to establish an ad-\nditional prerequisite for taking a case to district court,\ninstead of to the Federal Circuit. To fall within the\n\u00a77703(b)(2) exception, the Government says, it is not\nenough that a case qualify as a \u201ccase of discrimination\nsubject to [\u00a77702]\u201d; in addition, the MSPB\u2019s decision must\ncount as a \u201cjudicially reviewable action.\u201d See Brief for\nUnited States 20\u201321. If the MSPB\u2019s decision is not a\n\u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d\u2014a phrase the Government\ncharacterizes as a \u201cterm of art in this context,\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28\u2014the ruling still may be subject to judicial review\n(i.e., \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d in the ordinary sense), but\nonly in the Federal Circuit.\n   The Government\u2019s second step\u2014that the Board\u2019s pro-\ncedural rulings are not \u201cjudicially reviewable actions\u201d\u2014\nbegins with the language of \u00a77702(a)(3). That provision,\n10                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government states, \u201cdefines for the most part which\nMSPB decisions qualify as \u2018judicially reviewable ac-\ntions[s]\u2019 \u201d by \u201cproviding that \u2018[a]ny decision of the Board\nunder paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be a judicially\nreviewable action as of\u2019 the date of the decision.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 21 (quoting \u00a77702(a)(3); emphasis and\nbrackets added by Government). From there, the Govern-\nment moves on to the cross-referenced paragraph\u2014\n\u00a77702(a)(1)\u2014which states, among other things, that the\nBoard \u201cshall, within 120 days of [the employee\u2019s filing],\ndecide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable\naction in accordance with the Board\u2019s appellate proce-\ndures.\u201d According to the Government, the Board only\n\u201cdecide[s] . . . the issue of discrimination\u201d when it rules on\nthe merits, rather than on procedural grounds. On that\nview, a procedural decision is not in fact a \u201cdecision of the\nBoard under paragraph (1),\u201d which means that it also is\nnot a \u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d under \u00a77702(a)(3). See\nBrief for Respondent 21\u201322. And so (returning now to the\nfirst step of the Government\u2019s argument), judicial review\nof a procedural decision can occur only in the Federal\nCircuit, and not in district court.\n   If you need to take a deep breath after all that, you\u2019re\nnot alone. It would be hard to dream up a more round-\nabout way of bifurcating judicial review of the MSPB\u2019s\nrulings in mixed cases. If Congress had wanted to send\nmerits decisions to district court and procedural dismis-\nsals to the Federal Circuit, it could just have said so. The\nGovernment has offered no reason for Congress to have\nconstructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.\n   And taking the Government\u2019s analysis one step at a\ntime makes it no more plausible than as a gestalt. The\nGovernment\u2019s initial move is to read \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s second\nsentence as adding a requirement for a case to fall within\nthe exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. But that\nsentence does no such thing; it is nothing more than a\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiling deadline. Consider each sentence of \u00a77703(b)(2) in\nturn. The first sentence defines which cases should be\nbrought in district court, rather than in the Federal Cir-\ncuit; here, the full description is \u201c[c]ases of discrimination\nsubject to the provisions of section 7702\u201d\u2014to wit, mixed\ncases. The second sentence then states when those cases\nshould be brought: \u201cany such case . . . must be filed within\n30 days\u201d of the date the employee \u201creceived notice of the\njudicially reviewable action.\u201d The reference to a \u201cjudicially\nreviewable action\u201d in that sentence does important work:\nIt sets the clock running for when a case that belongs in\ndistrict court must be filed there. What it does not do is\nto further define which timely-brought cases belong in dis-\ntrict court instead of in the Federal Circuit. Describing\nthose cases is the first sentence\u2019s role.\n   Proof positive that the Government misreads\n\u00a77703(b)(2) comes from considering what the phrase \u201cju-\ndicially reviewable action\u201d would mean under its theory.\nIn normal legal parlance, to say that an agency action\nis not \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d is to say simply that it is not\nsubject to judicial review\u2014that, for one or another reason,\nit cannot be taken to a court. But that ordinary under-\nstanding will not work for the Government here, because\nit wants to use the phrase to help determine which of two\ncourts should review a decision, rather than whether\njudicial review is available at all. In the Government\u2019s\nalternate universe, then, to say that an agency action is\nnot \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d is to say that it is subject to\njudicial review in the Federal Circuit (even though not in\ndistrict court). Small wonder that the Government must\ncall the phrase \u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d a \u201cterm of\nart,\u201d supra, at 9: On a natural reading, the phrase defines\ncases amenable to judicial review, rather than routes\nthose cases as between two courts.\n   And even were we to indulge the Government that far,\nwe could not accept the second step of its analysis. At that\n12                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstage, remember, the Government contends that under\n\u00a77702 only decisions on the merits qualify as \u201cjudicially\nreviewable actions.\u201d The language on which the Govern-\nment principally relies, stated again, is as follows: \u201c[T]he\nBoard shall, within 120 days of [the employee\u2019s filing],\ndecide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable\naction.\u201d But that provision, too, is only a timing require-\nment; it is designed to ensure that the Board act promptly\non employees\u2019 complaints. We see no reason to think that\nembedded within that directive is a limitation on the class\nof \u201cjudicially reviewable actions.\u201d Nor (even were we to\nindulge the Government on that point as well) can we find\nthe particular restriction the Government urges. Accord-\ning to the Government, the MSPB does not \u201cdecide . . . the\nissue of discrimination\u201d when it dismisses a mixed case\non procedural grounds. But that phrase cannot bear the\nweight the Government places on it. All the phrase signi-\nfies is that the Board should dispose of the issue in some\nway, whether by actually adjudicating it or by holding that\nit was not properly raised. Indeed, were the Government\nright, \u00a77702(a)\u2019s statement that the Board \u201cshall\u201d decide\nthe issue of discrimination would appear to bar procedural\ndismissals, requiring the Board to resolve on the merits\neven untimely complaints. No one (least of all the Gov-\nernment, which here is defending a procedural ruling)\nthinks that a plausible congressional command.\n   Another section of the statute\u2014\u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\u2014puts the\nfinal nail in the coffin bearing the Government\u2019s argu-\nment. That section states: \u201c[I]f at any time after the 120th\nday following [an employee\u2019s filing] with the Board . . . ,\nthere is no judicially reviewable action[,] . . . an employee\nshall be entitled to file a civil action\u201d in district court\nunder a listed antidiscrimination statute. That provision,\nas the Government notes, is designed \u201cto save employees\nfrom being held in perpetual uncertainty by Board inac-\ntion.\u201d Brief for Respondent 28. But if, as the Government\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                 13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ninsists, a procedural ruling is not a \u201cjudicially reviewable\naction,\u201d then the provision would have another, surprising\neffect\u2014essentially blowing up the Government\u2019s argument\nfrom the inside. In that event, an employee whose suit\nthe Board had dismissed on procedural grounds could\nbring suit in district court under 7702(e)(1)(B) (so long as\n120 days had elapsed from her Board filing), because she\nwould have received \u201cno judicially reviewable action.\u201d And\nwhat\u2019s more, she could do so even many years later, be-\ncause the statute\u2019s usual 30-day filing deadline begins to\nrun only upon \u201cnotice of [a] judicially reviewable action.\u201d\n\u00a77703(b)(2). So an argument intended to keep employees\nlike Kloeckner out of district court would paradoxically,\nand nonsensically, result in giving them all the time in the\nworld to file suit there.\n   Responding to this unwelcome outcome, the Govern-\nment offers us an exit route: We should avoid \u201cabsurd\nresults,\u201d the Government urges, by applying \u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\nonly to \u201ccases over which the Board continues to exert\njurisdiction.\u201d Brief for Respondent 27, 28, n. 4. But as the\nGovernment admits, that \u201cgloss on the statute is not found\nin the text,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50; the Government\u2019s remedy\nrequires our reading new words into the statute. We\nthink a better option lies at hand. If we reject the Gov-\nernment\u2019s odd view of \u201cjudicially reviewable actions,\u201d\nthen no absurdity arises in the first place: \u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\nwould have no bearing on any case the MSPB dismissed\nwithin 120 days, whatever the grounds. It is the Govern-\nment\u2019s own misreading that creates the need to \u201cfix\u201d\n\u00a77702(e)(1)(B); take that away and the provision serves, as\nit was intended, only as a remedy for Board inaction.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Government supplements its tortuous reading of the CSRA\u2019s\n\ntext with an appeal to one of the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014in its words,\n\u201censuring that the Federal Circuit would develop a uniform body of\ncase law governing federal personnel issues.\u201d Brief for Respondent 32.\nWe have previously recognized that Congress, through the CSRA,\n14                      KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV\n  A federal employee who claims that an agency action\nappealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination\nstatute listed in \u00a77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review\nin district court, not in the Federal Circuit. That is\nso whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural\ngrounds or instead on the merits. Kloeckner therefore\nbrought her suit in the right place. We reverse the con-\ntrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit, and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsought to avoid \u201cunnecessary layer[s] of judicial review in lower federal\ncourts, and encourag[e] more consistent judicial decisions.\u201d United\nStates v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 449 (1988) (internal quotation marks\nand some bracketing omitted). But in this case, the Government\u2019s\nargument about the necessity of Federal Circuit review runs into an\ninconvenient fact: When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal\nCircuit did not exist, and \u00a77703(b)(1) thus provided, as the general rule,\nthat a federal employee should appeal a Board decision to 1 of the 12\nCourts of Appeals or the Court of Claims. See Civil Service Reform Act\nof 1978, 92 Stat. 1143. Moreover, the Government\u2019s own approach\nwould leave many cases involving federal employment issues in district\ncourt. If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an\nagency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit\nwill come to district court for a decision on both questions. See Wil-\nliams v. Department of Army, 715 F. 2d 1485, 1491 (CA Fed. 1983) (en\nbanc). In any event, even the most formidable argument concerning\nthe statute\u2019s purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the\nstatute\u2019s text.\n",

SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11\u2013184.      Argued October 2, 2012\u2014Decided December 10, 2012\nThe Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) permits a federal employ-\n  ee subjected to a particularly serious personnel action such as a dis-\n  charge or demotion to appeal her agency\u2019s decision to the Merit Sys-\n  tems Protection Board (MSPB or Board). Such an appeal may allege\n  that the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the\n  CSRA itself; but the appeal may also or instead charge the agency\n  with discrimination prohibited by a federal statute. See 5 U. S. C.\n  \u00a77702(a)(1). When an employee alleges that a personnel action ap-\n  pealable to the MSPB was based on discrimination, her case is known\n  as a \u201cmixed case.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302. Mixed cases are governed\n  by special procedures set out in the CSRA and regulations of the\n  MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n     Under those procedures, an employee may initiate a mixed case by\n  filing a discrimination complaint with the agency. If the agency de-\n  cides against the employee, she may either appeal the agency\u2019s deci-\n  sion to the MSPB or sue the agency in district court. Alternatively,\n  the employee can bypass the agency and bring her mixed case direct-\n  ly to the MSPB. If the MSPB upholds the personnel action, whether\n  in the first instance or after the agency has done so, the employee is\n  entitled to seek judicial review.\n     Section 7703(b)(1) of the CSRA provides that petitions for review of\n  MSPB decisions \u201cshall be filed in the . . . Federal Circuit,\u201d except as\n  provided in \u00a77703(b)(2). Section 7703(b)(2) instructs that \u201c[c]ases of\n  discrimination subject to the provisions of [\u00a77702] shall be filed under\n  [the enforcement provision of a listed antidiscrimination statute].\u201d\n  Those enforcement provisions all authorize suit in federal district\n  court. The \u201ccases of discrimination subject to the provisions of \u00a77702\u201d\n  are those in which an employee \u201c(A) has been affected by an action\n2                         KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB], and (B) alleges that a basis\n    for the action was discrimination prohibited by\u201d a listed federal stat-\n    ute; in other words, \u201cmixed cases.\u201d\n      In 2005, while an employee of the Department of Labor (DOL or\n    agency), petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner filed a complaint with the\n    agency\u2019s civil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in unlaw-\n    ful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to a hostile work en-\n    vironment. Following applicable EEOC regulations, DOL completed\n    an internal investigation and report, and Kloeckner requested a\n    hearing before an EEOC administrative judge. While the EEOC case\n    was pending, Kloeckner was fired. Because Kloeckner believed that\n    DOL\u2019s decision to fire her was based on unlawful discrimination, she\n    now had a \u201cmixed case.\u201d Kloeckner originally brought her mixed case\n    directly to the MSPB. Concerned about duplicative discovery ex-\n    penses between her EEOC and MSPB cases, she moved to amend her\n    EEOC complaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal and\n    asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice for four\n    months to allow the EEOC process to go forward. Both motions were\n    granted. In September 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal with-\n    out prejudice to her right to refile by January 18, 2007. The EEOC\n    case, however, continued until April 2007, when the EEOC judge\n    terminated the proceeding as a sanction for Kloeckner\u2019s bad-faith\n    discovery conduct and returned the case to DOL for a final decision.\n    In October, DOL ruled against Kloeckner on all of her claims.\n    Kloeckner appealed to the Board in November 2007. The Board dis-\n    missed Kloeckner\u2019s appeal as untimely, viewing it as an effort to reo-\n    pen her old MSPB case months after the January 18 deadline.\n      Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in Federal District\n    Court, alleging unlawful discrimination. The court dismissed the\n    complaint for lack of jurisdiction. It held that, because the MSPB\n    dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s claims on procedural grounds, she should have\n    sought review in the Federal Circuit under \u00a77703(b)(1); in the court\u2019s\n    view, the only discrimination cases that could go to district court pur-\n    suant to \u00a77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on the merits.\n    The Eighth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable\n to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in\n \u00a77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review in district court, not the Fed-\n eral Circuit, regardless whether the MSPB decided her case on pro-\n cedural grounds or on the merits. Pp. 7\u201314.\n    (a) Two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like\n Kloeckner to district court. Begin with \u00a7 7703, which governs judicial\n review of MSPB rulings. Section 7703(b)(1) provides that petitions to\n review the Board\u2019s final decisions should be filed in the Federal Cir-\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cuit\u2014\u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d Sec-\n  tion 7703(b)(2) then provides that \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to\n  the provisions of [\u00a77702]\u201d \u201cshall be filed under\u201d the enforcement pro-\n  vision of a listed antidiscrimination statute. Each of the referenced\n  enforcement provisions authorizes an action in federal district court.\n  Thus, \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [\u00a77702]\u201d\n  shall be filed in district court. Turn next to \u00a77702, which provides\n  that the cases \u201csubject to [its] provisions\u201d are cases in which a federal\n  employee \u201chas been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to\n  the [MSPB],\u201d and \u201calleges that a basis for the action was discrimina-\n  tion prohibited by\u201d a listed federal statute. The \u201ccases of discrimina-\n  tion subject to\u201d \u00a77702 are therefore mixed cases. Putting \u00a77703 and\n  \u00a77702 together, mixed cases shall be filed in district court. That is\n  where Kloeckner\u2019s case should have been, and indeed was, filed. Re-\n  gardless whether the MSPB dismissed her claim on the merits or\n  threw it out as untimely, she brought the kind of case that the CSRA\n  routes to district court. Pp. 7\u20138.\n     (b) The Government\u2019s alternative view\u2014that the CSRA directs the\n  MSPB\u2019s merits decisions to district court, while channeling its proce-\n  dural rulings to the Federal Circuit\u2014is not supported by the statute.\n  According to the Government, that bifurcated scheme, though not\n  specifically prescribed in the CSRA, lies hidden in the statute\u2019s tim-\n  ing requirements. But the Government cannot explain why Congress\n  would have constructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.\n  And taking the Government\u2019s analysis one step at a time makes it no\n  more plausible.

KLOECKNER, PETITIONER v. HILDA L.\n        SOLIS, SECRETARY OF LABOR\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 10, 2012]\n\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  A federal employee subjected to an adverse personnel\naction such as a discharge or demotion may appeal her\nagency\u2019s decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board\n(MSPB or Board). See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77512, 7701. In that\nchallenge, the employee may claim, among other things,\nthat the agency discriminated against her in violation of a\nfederal statute. See \u00a77702(a)(1). The question presented\nin this case arises when the MSPB dismisses an appeal\nalleging discrimination not on the merits, but on proce-\ndural grounds. Should an employee seeking judicial re-\nview then file a petition in the Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit, or instead bring a suit in district court\nunder the applicable antidiscrimination law? We hold she\nshould go to district court.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a71101 et seq., establishes a framework for evaluating per-\nsonnel actions taken against federal employees. That\nstatutory framework provides graduated procedural pro-\n2                     KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntections depending on an action\u2019s severity. If (but only if )\nthe action is particularly serious\u2014involving, for example,\na removal from employment or a reduction in grade or\npay\u2014the affected employee has a right to appeal the\nagency\u2019s decision to the MSPB, an independent adjudica-\ntor of federal employment disputes.1 See \u00a7\u00a71204, 7512,\n7701. Such an appeal may merely allege that the agency\nhad insufficient cause for taking the action under the\nCSRA; but the appeal may also or instead charge the\nagency with discrimination prohibited by another federal\nstatute, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e et seq., or the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7621 et seq. See 5\nU. S. C. \u00a77702(a)(1). When an employee complains of\na personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB\nand alleges that the action was based on discrimination,\nshe is said (by pertinent regulation) to have brought a\n\u201cmixed case.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302 (2012). The CSRA\nand regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) set out special proce-\ndures to govern such a case\u2014different from those used\nwhen the employee either challenges a serious personnel\naction under the CSRA alone or attacks a less serious\naction as discriminatory. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77702, 7703(b)(2)\n(2006 ed. and Supp. V); 5 CFR pt. 1201, subpt. E (2012);\n29 CFR pt. 1614, subpt. C.\n  A federal employee bringing a mixed case may pro-\nceed in a variety of ways. She may first file a discrim-\nination complaint with the agency itself, much as an\nemployee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to\nthe MSPB could do. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a); 29 CFR\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Theactions entitling an employee to appeal a case to the MSPB\ninclude \u201c(1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than 14 days; (3) a\nreduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough.\u201d 5\nU.

If the agency decides against her, the em-\nployee may then either take the matter to the MSPB or\nbypass further administrative review by suing the agency\nin district court. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(b); 29 CFR\n\u00a71614.302(d)(1)(i). Alternatively, the employee may initi-\nate the process by bringing her case directly to the MSPB,\nforgoing the agency\u2019s own system for evaluating discrimi-\nnation charges.      See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a); 29 CFR\n\u00a71614.302(b). If the MSPB upholds the personnel action\n(whether in the first instance or after the agency has done\nso), the employee again has a choice: She may request\nadditional administrative process, this time with the\nEEOC, or else she may seek judicial review. See 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a77702(a)(3), (b); 5 CFR \u00a71201.161; 29 CFR \u00a71614.303.\nThe question in this case concerns where that judicial\nreview should take place.\n   Section 7703 of the CSRA governs judicial review of the\nMSPB\u2019s decisions. Section 7703(b)(1) gives the basic rule:\n\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a\npetition to review a . . . final decision of the Board shall be\nfiled in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit.\u201d Section 7703(b)(2) then spells out the exception:\n    \u201cCases of discrimination subject to the provisions of\n    section 7702 of this title shall be filed under [the\n    enforcement sections of the Civil Rights Act, Age\n    Discrimination in Employment Act, and Fair Labor\n    Standards Act], as applicable. Notwithstanding any\n    other provision of law, any such case filed under any\n    such section must be filed within 30 days after the\n    date the individual filing the case received notice of\n    the judicially reviewable action under such section\n    7702.\u201d\nThe enforcement provisions of the antidiscrimination\nstatutes listed in this exception all authorize suit in fed-\neral district court. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72000e\u201316(c), 2000e\u2013\n4                   KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n5(f ); 29 U. S.

S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at\n9\u201310).\n  Section 7702 describes and provides for the \u201ccases of\ndiscrimination\u201d referenced in \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception. In\nrelevant part, \u00a77702(a)(1) states:\n    \u201c[I]n the case of any employee . . . who\u2014\n       \u201c(A) has been affected by an action which the em-\n       ployee . . . may appeal to the Merit Systems Protec-\n       tion Board, and\n       \u201c(B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimi-\n       nation prohibited by [specified antidiscrimination\n       statutes],\n    \u201cthe Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the\n    appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and\n    the appealable action in accordance with the Board\u2019s\n    appellate procedures.\u201d\nThe \u201ccases of discrimination\u201d in \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception, in\nother words, are mixed cases, in which an employee chal-\nlenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to\nthe MSPB.\n  The parties here dispute whether, in light of these in-\nterwoven statutory provisions, an employee should go to\nthe Federal Circuit (pursuant to the general rule of\n\u00a77703(b)(1)), or instead to a district court (pursuant to the\nexception in \u00a77703(b)(2)), when the MSPB has dismissed\nher mixed case on procedural grounds.\n                               B\n  Petitioner Carolyn Kloeckner used to work at the De-\npartment of Labor (DOL or agency). In June 2005, while\nstill an employee, she filed a complaint with the agency\u2019s\ncivil rights office, alleging that DOL had engaged in un-\nlawful sex and age discrimination by subjecting her to\na hostile work environment. At that point, Kloeckner\u2019s\ncase was not appealable to the MSPB because she had not\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsuffered a sufficiently serious personnel action (e.g., a\nremoval or demotion). See supra, at 1\u20132. Her claim thus\nwent forward not under the special procedures for mixed\ncases, but under the EEOC\u2019s regulations for all other\ncharges of discrimination. See 29 CFR pt. 1614, subpts.\nA, D. In line with those rules, the agency completed an\ninternal investigation and report in June 2006, and\nKloeckner requested a hearing before an EEOC adminis-\ntrative judge.\n  The next month, DOL fired Kloeckner. A removal from\nemployment is appealable to the MSPB, see supra, at 1\u20132,\nand Kloeckner believed the agency\u2019s action was discrimi-\nnatory; she therefore now had a mixed case. As permitted\nby regulation, see supra, at 3, she initially elected to file\nthat case with the MSPB. Her claim of discriminatory\nremoval, however, raised issues similar to those in her\nhostile work environment case, now pending before an\nEEOC judge; as a result, she became concerned that she\nwould incur duplicative discovery expenses. To address\nthat problem, she sought leave to amend her EEOC com-\nplaint to include her claim of discriminatory removal, and\nshe asked the MSPB to dismiss her case without prejudice\nfor four months to allow the EEOC process to go forward.\nSee App. 13, 50\u201351. Both of those motions were granted.\nThe EEOC judge accepted the amendment,2 and on Sep-\ntember 18, 2006, the MSPB dismissed her appeal \u201cwithout\nprejudice to [her] right to refile . . . either (A) within 30\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Neither the CSRA nor any regulation explicitly authorizes an EEOC\n\njudge to consider the legality of a removal or other serious personnel\naction before the Board has done so. See supra, at 2\u20133. Nonetheless,\nthe EEOC has approved that approach when the issues the personnel\naction raises are \u201cfirmly enmeshed\u201d in an ongoing EEOC proceeding in\norder to avoid \u201cdelay[ing] justice and creat[ing] unnecessary proce-\ndural complications.\u201d Burton v.

SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndays after a decision is rendered in her EEOC case; or (B)\nby January 18, 2007\u2014whichever occurs first.\u201d Id., at 5.\n  Discovery continued in the EEOC proceeding well past\nthe MSPB\u2019s January 18 deadline. In April, the EEOC\njudge found that Kloeckner had engaged in bad-faith\nconduct in connection with discovery. As a sanction, the\njudge terminated the EEOC proceeding and returned\nKloeckner\u2019s case to DOL for a final decision. Six months\nlater, in October 2007, DOL issued a ruling rejecting all of\nKloeckner\u2019s claims. See id., at 10\u201349.\n  Kloeckner appealed DOL\u2019s decision to the Board in\nNovember 2007. That appeal was filed within 30 days,\nthe usual window for seeking MSPB review of an agency\u2019s\ndetermination of a mixed case. See 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a);\n29 CFR \u00a71614.302(d)(1)(ii). But the MSPB declined to\ntreat Kloeckner\u2019s filing as an ordinary appeal of such an\nagency decision. Instead, the Board viewed it as an effort\nto reopen her old MSPB case\u2014many months after the\nJanuary 18 deadline for doing so had expired. The Board\ntherefore dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s appeal as untimely. See\nApp. 53\u201357.\n  Kloeckner then brought this action against DOL in\nFederal District Court, alleging unlawful discrimination.\nThe District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of\njurisdiction. See Kloeckner v. Solis, Civ. Action No.\n4:09CV804 (ED Mo., Feb. 18, 2010). Relying on the\nEighth Circuit\u2019s ruling in Brumley v. Levinson, 991 F. 2d\n801 (1993) (per curiam), the court held that because the\nMSPB had dismissed Kloeckner\u2019s claims on procedural\ngrounds, she should have sought review in the Federal\nCircuit under \u00a77703(b)(1); in the court\u2019s view, the only\ndiscrimination cases that could go to district court pursu-\nant to \u00a77703(b)(2) were those the MSPB had decided on\nthe merits. The Eighth Circuit affirmed on the same\nreasoning. See 639 F. 3d 834 (2011).\n  We granted certiorari, 565 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                  7\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCircuit split on whether an employee seeking judicial\nreview should proceed in the Federal Circuit or in a dis-\ntrict court when the MSPB has dismissed her mixed case\non procedural grounds.3 We now reverse the Eighth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision.\n                              II\n   As the above account reveals, the intersection of fed-\neral civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced\na complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving\nclaims of discrimination in the federal workplace. But\neven within the most intricate and complex systems, some\nthings are plain. So it is in this case, where two sections\nof the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeck-\nner to district court.\n   Begin with \u00a77703, which governs judicial review of the\nMSPB\u2019s rulings. As already noted, see supra, at 3\u20134,\n\u00a77703(b)(1) provides that petitions to review the Board\u2019s\nfinal decisions should be filed in the Federal Circuit\u2014\n\u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.\u201d\nParagraph (2), i.e., \u00a77703(b)(2), then sets out a different\nrule for one category of cases\u2014\u201c[c]ases of discrimination\nsubject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title.\u201d Such\na case, paragraph (2) instructs, \u201cshall be filed under\u201d the\nenforcement provision of an enumerated antidiscrimina-\ntion statute. And each of those enforcement provisions\nauthorizes an action in federal district court. See supra,\nat 3\u20134. So \u201c[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provi-\nsions of section 7702\u201d shall be filed in district court.\n   Turn next to \u00a77702, which identifies the cases \u201csubject\nto [its] provisions.\u201d As also stated earlier, \u00a77702(a)(1) de-\nscribes cases in which a federal employee \u201c(A) has been\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare   639 F. 3d 834 (CA8 2011) (case below) (Federal Circuit);\nBallentine v. MSPB, 738 F. 2d 1244 (CA Fed. 1984) (same), with Harms\nv. IRS, 321 F. 3d 1001 (CA10 2003) (district court); Downey v. Runyon,\n160 F. 3d 139 (CA2 1998) (same).\n8                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\naffected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit\nSystems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis\nfor the action was discrimination prohibited by\u201d a listed\nfederal statute. The subsection thus describes what we\n(adopting the lingo of the applicable regulations) have\ncalled \u201cmixed cases.\u201d See 29 CFR \u00a71614.302. Those are\nthe \u201ccases of discrimination subject to\u201d the rest of \u00a77702\u2019s\nprovisions.\n   Now just put \u00a77703 and \u00a77702 together\u2014say, in the\nform of a syllogism, to make the point obvious. Under\n\u00a77703(b)(2), \u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d\nshall be filed in district court. Under \u00a77702(a)(1), the\n\u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d are mixed\ncases\u2014those appealable to the MSPB and alleging dis-\ncrimination. Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district\ncourt.\n   And so that is where Kloeckner\u2019s case should have been\nfiled (as indeed it was). No one here contests that Kloeck-\nner brought a mixed case\u2014that she was affected by an\naction (i.e., removal) appealable to the MSPB and that she\nalleged discrimination prohibited by an enumerated fed-\neral law. And under the CSRA\u2019s terms, that is all that\nmatters. Regardless whether the MSPB dismissed her\nclaim on the merits or instead threw it out as untimely,\nKloeckner brought the kind of case that the CSRA routes,\nin crystalline fashion, to district court.\n                              III\n  The Government offers an alternative view (as did the\nEighth Circuit)\u2014that the CSRA directs the MSPB\u2019s merits\ndecisions to district court, while channeling its procedural\nrulings to the Federal Circuit. According to the Govern-\nment, that bifurcated scheme, though not prescribed in\nthe CSRA in so many words, lies hidden in the statute\u2019s\ntiming requirements. But we return from the Govern-\nment\u2019s mazelike tour of the CSRA persuaded only that the\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits-procedure distinction is a contrivance, found no-\nwhere in the statute\u2019s provisions on judicial review.\n   The Government\u2019s argument has two necessary steps.\nFirst, the Government claims that \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s exception\nto Federal Circuit jurisdiction applies only when the\nMSPB\u2019s decision in a mixed case is a \u201cjudicially review-\nable action\u201d under \u00a77702. Second, the Government asserts\nthat the Board\u2019s dismissal of a mixed case on procedural\ngrounds does not qualify as such a \u201cjudicially reviewable\naction.\u201d We describe in turn the way the Government\narrives at each of these conclusions.\n   The first step of the Government\u2019s argument derives\nfrom \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s second sentence. Right after stating\nthat \u201ccases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]\u201d shall be\nfiled under specified antidiscrimination statutes (i.e., shall\nbe filed in district court), \u00a77703(b)(2) provides: \u201cNotwith-\nstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed\nunder any such [statute] must be filed within 30 days\nafter the date the individual filing the case received notice\nof the judicially reviewable action under section 7702.\u201d\nThe Government reads that sentence to establish an ad-\nditional prerequisite for taking a case to district court,\ninstead of to the Federal Circuit. To fall within the\n\u00a77703(b)(2) exception, the Government says, it is not\nenough that a case qualify as a \u201ccase of discrimination\nsubject to [\u00a77702]\u201d; in addition, the MSPB\u2019s decision must\ncount as a \u201cjudicially reviewable action.\u201d See Brief for\nUnited States 20\u201321. If the MSPB\u2019s decision is not a\n\u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d\u2014a phrase the Government\ncharacterizes as a \u201cterm of art in this context,\u201d Tr. of Oral\nArg. 28\u2014the ruling still may be subject to judicial review\n(i.e., \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d in the ordinary sense), but\nonly in the Federal Circuit.\n   The Government\u2019s second step\u2014that the Board\u2019s pro-\ncedural rulings are not \u201cjudicially reviewable actions\u201d\u2014\nbegins with the language of \u00a77702(a)(3). That provision,\n10                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Government states, \u201cdefines for the most part which\nMSPB decisions qualify as \u2018judicially reviewable ac-\ntions[s]\u2019 \u201d by \u201cproviding that \u2018[a]ny decision of the Board\nunder paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be a judicially\nreviewable action as of\u2019 the date of the decision.\u201d Brief\nfor Respondent 21 (quoting \u00a77702(a)(3); emphasis and\nbrackets added by Government). From there, the Govern-\nment moves on to the cross-referenced paragraph\u2014\n\u00a77702(a)(1)\u2014which states, among other things, that the\nBoard \u201cshall, within 120 days of [the employee\u2019s filing],\ndecide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable\naction in accordance with the Board\u2019s appellate proce-\ndures.\u201d According to the Government, the Board only\n\u201cdecide[s] . . . the issue of discrimination\u201d when it rules on\nthe merits, rather than on procedural grounds. On that\nview, a procedural decision is not in fact a \u201cdecision of the\nBoard under paragraph (1),\u201d which means that it also is\nnot a \u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d under \u00a77702(a)(3). See\nBrief for Respondent 21\u201322. And so (returning now to the\nfirst step of the Government\u2019s argument), judicial review\nof a procedural decision can occur only in the Federal\nCircuit, and not in district court.\n   If you need to take a deep breath after all that, you\u2019re\nnot alone. It would be hard to dream up a more round-\nabout way of bifurcating judicial review of the MSPB\u2019s\nrulings in mixed cases. If Congress had wanted to send\nmerits decisions to district court and procedural dismis-\nsals to the Federal Circuit, it could just have said so. The\nGovernment has offered no reason for Congress to have\nconstructed such an obscure path to such a simple result.\n   And taking the Government\u2019s analysis one step at a\ntime makes it no more plausible than as a gestalt. The\nGovernment\u2019s initial move is to read \u00a77703(b)(2)\u2019s second\nsentence as adding a requirement for a case to fall within\nthe exception to Federal Circuit jurisdiction. But that\nsentence does no such thing; it is nothing more than a\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfiling deadline. Consider each sentence of \u00a77703(b)(2) in\nturn. The first sentence defines which cases should be\nbrought in district court, rather than in the Federal Cir-\ncuit; here, the full description is \u201c[c]ases of discrimination\nsubject to the provisions of section 7702\u201d\u2014to wit, mixed\ncases. The second sentence then states when those cases\nshould be brought: \u201cany such case . . . must be filed within\n30 days\u201d of the date the employee \u201creceived notice of the\njudicially reviewable action.\u201d The reference to a \u201cjudicially\nreviewable action\u201d in that sentence does important work:\nIt sets the clock running for when a case that belongs in\ndistrict court must be filed there. What it does not do is\nto further define which timely-brought cases belong in dis-\ntrict court instead of in the Federal Circuit. Describing\nthose cases is the first sentence\u2019s role.\n   Proof positive that the Government misreads\n\u00a77703(b)(2) comes from considering what the phrase \u201cju-\ndicially reviewable action\u201d would mean under its theory.\nIn normal legal parlance, to say that an agency action\nis not \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d is to say simply that it is not\nsubject to judicial review\u2014that, for one or another reason,\nit cannot be taken to a court. But that ordinary under-\nstanding will not work for the Government here, because\nit wants to use the phrase to help determine which of two\ncourts should review a decision, rather than whether\njudicial review is available at all. In the Government\u2019s\nalternate universe, then, to say that an agency action is\nnot \u201cjudicially reviewable\u201d is to say that it is subject to\njudicial review in the Federal Circuit (even though not in\ndistrict court). Small wonder that the Government must\ncall the phrase \u201cjudicially reviewable action\u201d a \u201cterm of\nart,\u201d supra, at 9: On a natural reading, the phrase defines\ncases amenable to judicial review, rather than routes\nthose cases as between two courts.\n   And even were we to indulge the Government that far,\nwe could not accept the second step of its analysis. At that\n12                  KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstage, remember, the Government contends that under\n\u00a77702 only decisions on the merits qualify as \u201cjudicially\nreviewable actions.\u201d The language on which the Govern-\nment principally relies, stated again, is as follows: \u201c[T]he\nBoard shall, within 120 days of [the employee\u2019s filing],\ndecide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable\naction.\u201d But that provision, too, is only a timing require-\nment; it is designed to ensure that the Board act promptly\non employees\u2019 complaints. We see no reason to think that\nembedded within that directive is a limitation on the class\nof \u201cjudicially reviewable actions.\u201d Nor (even were we to\nindulge the Government on that point as well) can we find\nthe particular restriction the Government urges. Accord-\ning to the Government, the MSPB does not \u201cdecide . . . the\nissue of discrimination\u201d when it dismisses a mixed case\non procedural grounds. But that phrase cannot bear the\nweight the Government places on it. All the phrase signi-\nfies is that the Board should dispose of the issue in some\nway, whether by actually adjudicating it or by holding that\nit was not properly raised. Indeed, were the Government\nright, \u00a77702(a)\u2019s statement that the Board \u201cshall\u201d decide\nthe issue of discrimination would appear to bar procedural\ndismissals, requiring the Board to resolve on the merits\neven untimely complaints. No one (least of all the Gov-\nernment, which here is defending a procedural ruling)\nthinks that a plausible congressional command.\n   Another section of the statute\u2014\u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\u2014puts the\nfinal nail in the coffin bearing the Government\u2019s argu-\nment. That section states: \u201c[I]f at any time after the 120th\nday following [an employee\u2019s filing] with the Board . . . ,\nthere is no judicially reviewable action[,] . . . an employee\nshall be entitled to file a civil action\u201d in district court\nunder a listed antidiscrimination statute. That provision,\nas the Government notes, is designed \u201cto save employees\nfrom being held in perpetual uncertainty by Board inac-\ntion.\u201d Brief for Respondent 28. But if, as the Government\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2012)                 13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ninsists, a procedural ruling is not a \u201cjudicially reviewable\naction,\u201d then the provision would have another, surprising\neffect\u2014essentially blowing up the Government\u2019s argument\nfrom the inside. In that event, an employee whose suit\nthe Board had dismissed on procedural grounds could\nbring suit in district court under 7702(e)(1)(B) (so long as\n120 days had elapsed from her Board filing), because she\nwould have received \u201cno judicially reviewable action.\u201d And\nwhat\u2019s more, she could do so even many years later, be-\ncause the statute\u2019s usual 30-day filing deadline begins to\nrun only upon \u201cnotice of [a] judicially reviewable action.\u201d\n\u00a77703(b)(2). So an argument intended to keep employees\nlike Kloeckner out of district court would paradoxically,\nand nonsensically, result in giving them all the time in the\nworld to file suit there.\n   Responding to this unwelcome outcome, the Govern-\nment offers us an exit route: We should avoid \u201cabsurd\nresults,\u201d the Government urges, by applying \u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\nonly to \u201ccases over which the Board continues to exert\njurisdiction.\u201d Brief for Respondent 27, 28, n. 4. But as the\nGovernment admits, that \u201cgloss on the statute is not found\nin the text,\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 50; the Government\u2019s remedy\nrequires our reading new words into the statute. We\nthink a better option lies at hand. If we reject the Gov-\nernment\u2019s odd view of \u201cjudicially reviewable actions,\u201d\nthen no absurdity arises in the first place: \u00a77702(e)(1)(B)\nwould have no bearing on any case the MSPB dismissed\nwithin 120 days, whatever the grounds. It is the Govern-\nment\u2019s own misreading that creates the need to \u201cfix\u201d\n\u00a77702(e)(1)(B); take that away and the provision serves, as\nit was intended, only as a remedy for Board inaction.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Government supplements its tortuous reading of the CSRA\u2019s\n\ntext with an appeal to one of the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014in its words,\n\u201censuring that the Federal Circuit would develop a uniform body of\ncase law governing federal personnel issues.\u201d Brief for Respondent 32.\nWe have previously recognized that Congress, through the CSRA,\n14                      KLOECKNER v. SOLIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                             IV\n  A federal employee who claims that an agency action\nappealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination\nstatute listed in \u00a77702(a)(1) should seek judicial review\nin district court, not in the Federal Circuit. That is\nso whether the MSPB decided her case on procedural\ngrounds or instead on the merits. Kloeckner therefore\nbrought her suit in the right place. We reverse the con-\ntrary judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth\nCircuit, and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                      It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nsought to avoid \u201cunnecessary layer[s] of judicial review in lower federal\ncourts, and encourag[e] more consistent judicial decisions.\u201d United\nStates v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 449 (1988) (internal quotation marks\nand some bracketing omitted). But in this case, the Government\u2019s\nargument about the necessity of Federal Circuit review runs into an\ninconvenient fact: When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal\nCircuit did not exist, and \u00a77703(b)(1) thus provided, as the general rule,\nthat a federal employee should appeal a Board decision to 1 of the 12\nCourts of Appeals or the Court of Claims. See Civil Service Reform Act\nof 1978, 92 Stat. 1143. Moreover, the Government\u2019s own approach\nwould leave many cases involving federal employment issues in district\ncourt. If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an\nagency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit\nwill come to district court for a decision on both questions. See Wil-\nliams v. Department of Army, 715 F. 2d 1485, 1491 (CA Fed. 1983) (en\nbanc). In any event, even the most formidable argument concerning\nthe statute\u2019s purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the\nstatute\u2019s text.\n</pre>",
