The applicants are two closely held for-profit\ncorporations, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (Hobby Lobby) and\nMardel, Inc. (Mardel), and five family members who indi-\nrectly own and control those corporations. Hobby Lobby is\nan arts and crafts retail chainstore, with more than 13,000\nemployees in over 500 stores nationwide. Mardel is a\nchain of Christian-themed bookstores, with 372 full-time\nemployees in 35 stores. Employees of the two corporations\nand their families receive health insurance from the cor-\nporations\u2019 self-insured group health plans.\n  Under \u00a71001(5) of the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, 124 Stat. 131, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300gg\u201313(a), non\ngrandfathered group health plans must cover certain\npreventive health services without cost-sharing, including\nvarious preventive services for women as provided in\nguidelines issued by the Health Resources Services Ad-\nministration (HRSA), a component of the Department of\nHealth and Human Services.

Reg.\n8725 (Feb. 15, 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The applicants filed an action in Federal District Court\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief under the Free Exer-\ncise Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious\nFreedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000bb et seq. They allege that under the HRSA guide-\nlines, Hobby Lobby and Mardel will be required, contrary\nto the applicants\u2019 religious beliefs, to provide insurance\ncoverage for certain drugs and devices that the applicants\nbelieve can cause abortions. The applicants simultaneously\nfiled a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent\nenforcement of the contraception-coverage requirement,\nwhich is scheduled to take effect with respect to the em-\nployee insurance plans of Hobby Lobby and Mardel on\nJanuary 1, 2013. The District Court for the Western\nDistrict of Oklahoma denied the motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\ndenied the applicants\u2019 motion for an injunction pending\nresolution of the appeal.\n   The only source of authority for this Court to issue an\ninjunction is the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71651(a). \u201cWe\nhave consistently stated, and our own Rules so require,\nthat such power is to be used sparingly.\u201d Turner Broad-\ncasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 507 U.

This Court\nhas not previously addressed similar RFRA or free exer-\ncise claims brought by closely held for-profit corporations\nand their controlling shareholders alleging that the man-\ndatory provision of certain employee benefits substantially\nburdens their exercise of religion. Cf. United States v. Lee,\n455 U. S. 252 (1982) (rejecting free exercise claim brought\nby individual Amish employer who argued that paying\nSocial Security taxes for his employees interfered with his\nexercise of religion). Moreover, the applicants correctly\nrecognize that lower courts have diverged on whether to\ngrant temporary injunctive relief to similarly situated\nplaintiffs raising similar claims, Application for Injunction\nPending Appellate Review 25\u201326, and no court has issued\na final decision granting permanent relief with respect to\nsuch claims. Second, while the applicants allege they will\nface irreparable harm if they are forced to choose between\ncomplying with the contraception-coverage requirement\nand paying significant fines, they cannot show that an\ninjunction is necessary or appropriate to aid our jurisdic-\n4         HOBBY LOBBY STORES, INC. v.
