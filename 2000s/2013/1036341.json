The\nCourt\u2019s opinion approving the order concluded with what I\ndescribed as a \u201cbizarre coda,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 12),\nwhich said that \u201c[t]he State may wish to move for modifi-\ncation\u201d of the injunction, and that the District Court \u201cmay\ngrant such a request provided that the State satisfies\nnecessary and appropriate preconditions,\u201d ibid.

More specifically, the opinion\nsuggested that modification might be in order if the State\nmakes \u201csignificant progress . . . toward remedying the\nunderlying constitutional violations\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[s]\nthat further population reductions are not necessary.\u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 47).

That was in my view\n\u201ca compromise solution\u201d that is \u201cunknown in our legal\nsystem,\u201d which does not permit appellate courts to pre-\nscribe in advance the exercise of district-court discretion.\nId., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 14). I warned, moreover,\nthat \u201cthe judges of the District Court are likely to call [the\nCourt\u2019s] bluff, since they know full well it cannot possibly\nbe an abuse of discretion to refuse to accept the State\u2019s\nproposed modifications in an injunction that has just been\napproved (affirmed) in its present form.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14).\n   The bluff has been called, and the Court has nary a pair\nto lay on the table. The State, seeking to invoke the ex\nante appellate control of district-court discretion, and to\ncompel the modification decreed by the Court\u2019s raised\neyebrow, provided evidence that it has made meaningful\nprogress and that population reductions to the level re-\nquired by the injunction are unnecessary. But the latter\nargument was made and rejected in the last round, and\nthe former hardly requires (demands) modification of the\ninjunction. It was predictable two Terms ago that the\nState would make progress\u2014indeed, it promised to do so.\nIf the reality of incremental progress makes the injunction\nnow invalid, the probability (indeed, one might say the\ncertainty) of incremental progress made the injunction an\noverreach two Terms ago. Surely it is not the case that\nwhen a party subject to an injunction makes substantial\nprogress toward compliance it is an abuse of discretion not\nto revise the injunction.\n   But as I suggested in my dissent, perhaps the Court\nnever meant to follow through on its revision suggestions.\nPerhaps they were nothing more than \u201ca ceremonial wash-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

After all, did we not want, and\nindeed even suggest, something better?\u201d Ibid. So also\ntoday, it is not our fault that California must now release\nupon the public nearly 10,000 inmates convicted of serious\ncrimes\u2014about 1,000 for every city larger than Santa\nAna\u2014three-quarters of whom are moderate (57%) or high\n(74%) recidivism risks. Reply in Support of Application 34.\n   It appears to have become a standard ploy, when this\nCourt vastly expands the Power of the Black Robe, to hint\nat limitations that make it seem not so bad. See, e.g.,\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 604 (2003) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting); United States v. Windsor, 570 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 25\u201326) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Comes\nthe moment of truth, the hinted-at limitation proves a\nsham. As for me, I adhere to my original view of this\nterrible injunction. It goes beyond what the Prison Litiga-\ntion Reform Act allows, and beyond the power of the\ncourts. I would grant the stay and dissolve the injunction.\n",
