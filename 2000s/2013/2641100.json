SEAN LANE, INDIVIDUALLY AND ON\n  BEHALF OF ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, ET AL.\n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 13\u2013136.       Decided [November 4, 2013]\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS respecting the\ndenial of certiorari.\n   In November 2007, respondent Facebook, Inc., released\na program called \u201cBeacon.\u201d It worked like this: When-\never someone visited the Web site of a participating com-\npany and performed a \u201ctrigger\u201d activity, such as posting a\ncomment or buying a product, the program would auto-\nmatically report the activity and the user\u2019s personally\nidentifiable information to Facebook\u2014regardless of whether\nthe user was a Facebook member. If the user was a Face-\nbook member, Facebook would publish the activity on\nhis member profile and broadcast it to everyone in his\n\u201cfriends\u201d network. So rent a movie from Blockbuster.com,\nand all your friends would know the title. Or plan a vaca-\ntion on Hotwire.com, and all your friends would know the\ndestination. To prevent Facebook from posting a particu-\nlar trigger activity, a member had to affirmatively opt out\nby clicking an icon in a pop-up window that appeared for\nabout ten seconds after he performed the activity.\n   Beacon resulted in the dissemination of large amounts\nof information Facebook members allegedly did not intend\nto share, provoking a public outcry against Beacon and\nFacebook. Facebook responded about a month after Bea-\n2                      MAREK v. LANE\n\n                  Statement of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncon\u2019s launch by changing the program\u2019s default setting\nfrom opt out to opt in, so that any given trigger activity\nwould not appear on a member\u2019s profile unless the mem-\nber explicitly consented. Facebook also allowed its mem-\nbers to disable Beacon altogether.\n   In August 2008, 19 individuals brought a putative class\naction lawsuit in the U. S. District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of California against Facebook and the companies\nthat had participated in Beacon, alleging violations of\nvarious federal and state privacy laws. The putative class\ncomprised only those individuals whose personal informa-\ntion had been obtained and disclosed by Beacon during\nthe approximately one-month period in which the pro-\ngram\u2019s default setting was opt out rather than opt in. The\ncomplaint sought damages and various forms of equitable\nrelief, including an injunction barring the defendants from\ncontinuing the program.\n   In the end, the vast majority of Beacon\u2019s victims got\nneither remedy. The named plaintiffs reached a settle-\nment agreement with the defendants before class certifi-\ncation. Although Facebook promised to discontinue the\n\u201cBeacon\u201d program itself, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel conceded at\nthe fairness hearing in the District Court that nothing in the\nsettlement would preclude Facebook from reinstituting the\nsame program with a new name. See Tr. 18 (Feb. 26,\n2010) (counsel for named plaintiffs) (\u201cAt the end of the day,\nwe could not reach agreement with defendants regarding\nlimiting their future actions as a corporation\u201d).\n   And while Facebook also agreed to pay $9.5 million, the\nparties allocated that fund in an unusual way. Plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel were awarded nearly a quarter of the fund in fees\nand costs, while the named plaintiffs received modest in-\ncentive payments. The unnamed class members, by con-\ntrast, received no damages from the remaining $6.5\nmillion. Instead, the parties earmarked that sum for a \u201ccy\npres\u201d remedy\u2014an \u201cas near as\u201d form of relief\u2014because\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                  Statement of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ndistributing the $6.5 million among the large number of\nclass members would result in too small an award per\nperson to bother. The cy pres remedy agreed to by the\nparties entailed the establishment of a new charitable\nfoundation that would help fund organizations dedicated\nto educating the public about online privacy. A Facebook\nrepresentative would be one of the three members of the\nnew foundation\u2019s board.\n   To top it off, the parties agreed to expand the settlement\nclass barred from future litigation to include not just those\nindividuals injured by Beacon during the brief period in\nwhich it was an opt-out program\u2014the class proposed in\nthe original complaint\u2014but also those injured after Face-\nbook had changed the program\u2019s default setting to opt in.\nFacebook thus insulated itself from all class claims arising\nfrom the Beacon episode by paying plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and\nthe named plaintiffs some $3 million and spending $6.5\nmillion to set up a foundation in which it would play a\nmajor role. The District Court approved the settlement\nas \u201cfair, reasonable, and adequate.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n23(e)(2); see Lane v. Facebook, Inc., Civ. No. C 08\u20133845,\n2010 WL 9013059 (ND Cal., Mar. 17, 2010).\n   Petitioner Megan Marek was one of four unnamed class\nmembers who objected to the settlement. Her challenge\nfocused on a number of disconcerting features of the new\nFoundation: the facts that a senior Facebook employee\nwould serve on its board, that the board would enjoy nearly\nunfettered discretion in selecting fund recipients, and\nthat the Foundation\u2014as a new entity\u2014necessarily lacked\na proven track record of promoting the objectives behind\nthe lawsuit. She also criticized the overall settlement\namount as too low. The District Court rebuffed these\nobjections, as did a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit on\nappeal. Lane v. Facebook, Inc., 696 F. 3d 811 (2012). A\npetition for rehearing en banc was denied, over the dissent\nof six judges. Lane v. Facebook, Inc., 709 F. 3d 791 (2013).\n4                      MAREK v. LANE\n\n                   Statement of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n  I agree with this Court\u2019s decision to deny the petition for\ncertiorari. Marek\u2019s challenge is focused on the particular\nfeatures of the specific cy pres settlement at issue. Grant-\ning review of this case might not have afforded the Court\nan opportunity to address more fundamental concerns\nsurrounding the use of such remedies in class action liti-\ngation, including when, if ever, such relief should be con-\nsidered; how to assess its fairness as a general matter;\nwhether new entities may be established as part of such\nrelief; if not, how existing entities should be selected; what\nthe respective roles of the judge and parties are in shaping\na cy pres remedy; how closely the goals of any enlisted\norganization must correspond to the interests of the class;\nand so on. This Court has not previously addressed any\nof these issues. Cy pres remedies, however, are a growing\nfeature of class action settlements. See Redish, Julian, &\nZyontz, Cy Pres Relief and the Pathologies of the Modern\nClass Action: A Normative and Empirical Analysis, 62 Fla.\nL. Rev. 617, 653\u2013656 (2010). In a suitable case, this Court\nmay need to clarify the limits on the use of such remedies.\n",
