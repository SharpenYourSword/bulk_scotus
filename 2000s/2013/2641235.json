TITLOW\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u2013414.      Argued October 8, 2013\u2014Decided November 5, 2013\nRespondent Titlow and Billie Rogers were arrested for the murder of\n  Billie\u2019s husband. After explaining to respondent that the State\u2019s evi-\n  dence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent\u2019s\n  attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agree-\n  ment to testify against Billie. Three days before Billie\u2019s trial, re-\n  spondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an\n  even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.\n  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the\n  original plea. Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted. Re-\n  spondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. On\n  direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assis-\n  tance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn\n  the strength of the State\u2019s evidence. The Michigan Court of Appeals\n  rejected the claim, concluding that Toca\u2019s actions were reasonable in\n  light of his client\u2019s protestations of innocence. On federal habeas re-\n  view, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set\n  forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling was\n  reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief. The Sixth Circuit\n  reversed. It found the factual predicate for the state court\u2019s deci-\n  sion\u2014that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent\u2019s assertion\n  of innocence\u2014an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,\n  given Toca\u2019s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision\n  to withdraw was made because the State\u2019s original plea offer was\n  higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guide-\n  lines. It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately\n  advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d stand-\n2                            BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ard of review recognized by the Court\u2019s case law when it refused to\n    credit the state court\u2019s reasonable factual finding and assumed that\n    counsel was ineffective where the record was silent. Pp. 4\u201311.\n       (a) AEDPA recognizes the federalism principle that state courts are\n    adequate forums for the vindication of federal statutory and constitu-\n    tional rights. It erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\n    for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court, re-\n    quiring them to \u201cshow that the state court\u2019s ruling . . . was so lacking\n    in justification that there was an error . . . beyond any possibility for\n    fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap-\n    peals\u2019 factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea\n    only after respondent\u2019s proclamation of innocence. The facts that re-\n    spondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when\n    Billie\u2019s husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who ad-\n    vised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and\n    hired Toca just three days before Billie\u2019s trial at which respondent\n    had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had\n    second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed inno-\n    cence to Toca. The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its\n    contrary conclusion was that Toca\u2019s sole explanation at the with-\n    drawal hearing focused on the fact that the State\u2019s plea offer was\n    substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.\n    The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca\u2019s representa-\n    tions to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about\n    a defendant\u2019s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to\n    plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal\n    punishment on the other. Accepting as true the Michigan Court of\n    Appeals\u2019 factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence\n    to Toca, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.\n    More troubling is that court\u2019s conclusion that Toca was ineffective be-\n    cause the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally\n    adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea. The Sixth Circuit\n    turned on its head the principle that counsel should be \u201cstrongly pre-\n    sumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n    decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\u201d Strick-\n    land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 690, with the burden to show oth-\n    erwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687. The single fact\n    that Toca failed to retrieve respondent\u2019s file from former counsel be-\n    fore withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Strickland\u2019s strong\n    presumption of effectiveness. In any event, respondent admitted in\n    open court that former counsel had explained the State\u2019s evidence\n    and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction. Toca was\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent un-\n  derstood the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. Toca\u2019s conduct in this\n  litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer\u2019s ethical violations do\n  not make the lawyer per se ineffective, and Toca\u2019s questionable con-\n  duct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 6\u201311.\n680 F. 3d 577, reversed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

BURT, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When a state prisoner asks a federal court to set aside a\nsentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel during\nplea bargaining, our cases require that the federal court\nuse a \u201c \u2018doubly deferential\u2019 \u201d standard of review that gives\nboth the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of\nthe doubt. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17). In this case, the Sixth Circuit failed to\napply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to\ncredit a state court\u2019s reasonable factual finding and by\nassuming that counsel was ineffective where the record\nwas silent. Because the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), do not\npermit federal judges to so casually second-guess the\ndecisions of their state-court colleagues or defense attor\u00ad\nneys, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision must be reversed.\n                           I\n  Respondent Titlow and Billie Rogers, respondent\u2019s aunt,\nmurdered Billie\u2019s husband Don by pouring vodka down his\nthroat and smothering him with a pillow. With help from\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agree\u00ad\nment with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead\nguilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sen\u00ad\ntence. As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the\nState\u2019s evidence with respondent \u201cover a long period of\ntime,\u201d and respondent understood that that evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. App. 43\u201344.\nThe Michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.\n   Three days before Billie Rogers\u2019 trial was to commence,\nhowever, respondent retained a new lawyer, Frederick\nToca. With Toca\u2019s help, respondent demanded a substan\u00ad\ntially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of\nseven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and\ntestify. When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new\ndemands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging\nin open court the consequences of withdrawal (including\nreinstatement of the first-degree murder charge). Without\nrespondent\u2019s critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquit\u00ad\nted, and later died.\n   Respondent subsequently stood trial. During the course\nof the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don\nRogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered\nhis mouth or poured vodka down his throat, that Billie\nintended to harm him. Indeed, respondent testified to\nattempting to prevent Billie from harming her husband.\nThe jury, however, elected to believe respondent\u2019s previous\nout-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated\nparticipation in the killing, and convicted respondent of\nsecond-degree murder. The trial court imposed a 20- to\n40-year term of imprisonment.\n   On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca advised\nwithdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn\nmore about the case, thereby failing to realize the strength\nof the State\u2019s evidence and providing ineffective assistance\nof counsel. Rejecting that claim, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals found that Toca acted reasonably in light of his\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)              3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclient\u2019s protestations of innocence. That court found that\nrespondent\u2019s decision to hire Toca was \u201cset in motion\u201d by\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cstatement to a sheriff \u2019s deputy that [re\u00ad\nspondent] did not commit the offense.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 101a. Applying the standard set forth by our deci\u00ad\nsion in Strickland, which requires that defense counsel\nsatisfy \u201can objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d 466\nU. S., at 688, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded\nthat \u201c[w]hen a defendant proclaims . . . innocence . . . , it is\nnot objectively unreasonable to recommend that the de\u00ad\nfendant refrain from pleading guilty\u2014no matter how\n\u2018good\u2019 the deal may appear.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a.\n   Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition under\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. Applying AEDPA\u2019s deferential stand\u00ad\nard of review, the District Court concluded that the Michi\u00ad\ngan Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling was \u201ccompletely reasonable\non the law and the facts\u201d and denied relief. No. 07\u2013CV\u2013\n13614, 2010 WL 4115410, *15 (ED Mich., Oct. 19, 2010).\nIn particular, the District Court concluded that \u201c[c]ounsel\ncould not be ineffective by trying to negotiate a better plea\nagreement for [Titlow] with Billie Rogers\u2019s trial imminent\nand [Titlow] stating at the time that Billie Rogers had\ncommitted the murder without . . . assistance.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Sixth Circuit reversed. It found that the factual\npredicate for the state court\u2019s decision\u2014that the with\u00ad\ndrawal of the plea was based on respondent\u2019s assertion of\ninnocence\u2014was an unreasonable interpretation of the\nfactual record, given Toca\u2019s explanation at the withdrawal\nhearing that \u201cthe decision to withdraw Titlow\u2019s plea was\nbased on the fact that the State\u2019s plea offer was substan\u00ad\ntially higher than the Michigan guidelines for second\u00ad\ndegree murder.\u201d 680 F. 3d 577, 589 (2012). Further\nobserving that \u201c[t]he record in this case contains no evi\u00ad\ndence\u201d that Toca fully informed respondent of the possible\nconsequences of withdrawing the guilty plea, the Sixth\nCircuit held that Toca rendered ineffective assistance of\n4                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel that resulted in respondent\u2019s loss of the benefit of\nthe plea bargain. Id., at 589\u2013592. Citing our decision in\nLafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), the Sixth Circuit\nremanded this case with instructions that the prosecution\nmust reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent,\nand that the state court should \u201cconsul[t]\u201d the plea agree\u00ad\nment and \u201cfashion\u201d a remedy for the violation of respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel during plea bargaining. 680 F. 3d, at 592. Chief\nJudge Batchelder dissented on the grounds that the Mich\u00ad\nigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was reasonable. Id., at\n593.\n  On remand, the prosecution followed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\ninstructions and reoffered the plea agreement it had of\u00ad\nfered some 10 years before\u2014even though, in light of Billie\nRogers\u2019 acquittal and subsequent death, respondent was\nno longer able to deliver on the promises originally made\nto the prosecution. At the plea hearing, however, re\u00ad\nspondent balked, refusing to provide a factual basis for the\nplea which the court could accept. Respondent admitted\nto pouring vodka down Don Rogers\u2019 throat, but denied\nassisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka\ndown his throat could lead to his death. As at trial, re\u00ad\nspondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie Rogers\nfrom harming her husband. Eventually, after conferring\nwith current counsel (not Toca), respondent admitted to\nplacing Don Rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his\nthroat with the knowledge that his death could result.\nThe trial court took the plea under advisement, where the\nmatter stands at present. We granted certiorari. 568\nU. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n  AEDPA instructs that, when a federal habeas petitioner\nchallenges the factual basis for a prior state-court decision\nrejecting a claim, the federal court may overturn the state\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt\u2019s decision only if it was \u201cbased on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence pre-\nsented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(2).\nThe prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the state\ncourt\u2019s factual findings \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d\n\u00a72254(e)(1). We have not defined the precise relationship\nbetween \u00a72254(d)(2) and \u00a72254(e)(1), and we need not do\nso here. See Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S. 290, 293 (2010). For\npresent purposes, it is enough to reiterate \u201cthat a state\u00ad\ncourt factual determination is not unreasonable merely\nbecause the federal habeas court would have reached a\ndifferent conclusion in the first instance.\u201d Id., at 301.\nAEDPA likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for\nreviewing claims of legal error by the state courts: A writ\nof habeas corpus may issue only if the state court\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli\u00ad\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby\u201d this Court. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   AEDPA recognizes a foundational principle of our fed-\neral system: State courts are adequate forums for the vindi-\ncation of federal rights. \u201c[T]he States possess sovereignty\nconcurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject\nonly to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\nUnder this system of dual sovereignty, we have consist-\nently held that state courts have inherent authority, and\nare thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims\narising under the laws of the United States.\u201d Tafflin v.\nLevitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). This principle applies to\nclaimed violations of constitutional, as well as statutory,\nrights. See Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 443\n(1977). Indeed, \u201cstate courts have the solemn responsibil\u00ad\nity equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitu\u00ad\ntional rights,\u201d and this Court has refused to sanction any\ndecision that would \u201creflec[t] negatively upon [a] state\ncourt\u2019s ability to do so.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Especially where a case involves such a common\n6                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim as ineffective assistance of counsel under Strick-\nland\u2014a claim state courts have now adjudicated in count\u00ad\nless criminal cases for nearly 30 years\u2014\u201cthere is no\nintrinsic reason why the fact that a man is a federal judge\nshould make him more competent, or conscientious, or\nlearned . . . than his neighbor in the state courthouse.\u201d\nStone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 494, n. 35 (1976) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Recognizing the duty and ability of our state-court\ncolleagues to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,\nAEDPA erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\nfor prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state\ncourt. AEDPA requires \u201ca state prisoner [to] show that\nthe state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in\nfederal court was so lacking in justification that there was\nan error . . . beyond any possibility for fairminded disa\u00ad\ngreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). \u201cIf this standard is difficult to\nmeet\u201d\u2014and it is\u2014\u201cthat is because it was meant to be.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We will not lightly conclude\nthat a State\u2019s criminal justice system has experienced the\n\u201cextreme malfunctio[n]\u201d for which federal habeas relief is\nthe remedy. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                             III\n  The record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals\u2019 factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the\nguilty plea only after respondent\u2019s proclamation of inno\u00ad\ncence. Respondent passed a polygraph denying planning\nto kill Don Rogers or being in the room when he died.\nThereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, re\u00ad\nspondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).1 That\nconversation \u201cset into motion\u201d respondent\u2019s decision to\nretain Toca. Ibid., \u00b68. Those facts, together with the\ntiming of Toca\u2019s hiring\u2014on the eve of the trial at which\nrespondent was to self-incriminate\u2014strongly suggest that\nrespondent had second thoughts about confessing in open\ncourt and proclaimed innocence to Toca. That conclusion\nis further bolstered by respondent\u2019s maintenance of inno\u00ad\ncence of Don Rogers\u2019 death at trial.\n   Indeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult.\nRespondent\u2019s first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal\nthat was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by\nrespondent in open court, that the State\u2019s evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. This deal\ninvolved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year\nsentence\u2014far less than the mandatory sentence of life in\nprison that results from a conviction for first-degree mur\u00ad\nder under Michigan law. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7750.316 (West Supp. 2013). Yet after a jailer advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty, some-\nthing caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca\n(who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and\nthen to maintain innocence at trial. If that something was\nnot a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine\nwhat it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative\ntheory.\n   The only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclu\u00ad\nsion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent complains that the state court improperly relied on this\n\naffidavit, but it was respondent who provided the affidavit to the state\ncourt and asked it to rely on the affidavit as part of the ground for\nremanding for an evidentiary hearing. In any event, even if the state\ncourt used the affidavit for a purpose not permitted by state law\u2014a\nproposition we do not endorse\u2014that would not empower a federal court\nto grant habeas relief. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991).\n8                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to withdraw the guilty plea, he \u201cdid not refer to\nTitlow\u2019s claims of innocence,\u201d but instead \u201cexplained that\nthe decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact\nthat the State\u2019s plea offer was substantially higher than\nthe Michigan guidelines\u201d for manslaughter. 680 F. 3d, at\n589. The Sixth Circuit believed that this fact \u201csufficiently\nrebuts the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 finding that the\nplea withdrawal was based on Titlow\u2019s assertion of inno\u00ad\ncence.\u201d Ibid.\n   But the Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of\nToca\u2019s representations to the trial court, noting in its\nopinion that respondent \u201cmoved to withdraw [the] plea\nbecause the agreed upon sentence exceeded the sentencing\nguidelines range.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a. The Michi\u00ad\ngan Court of Appeals, however\u2014unlike the Sixth Circuit\u2014\nalso correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent\nabout a defendant\u2019s asserting innocence on the one hand\nand refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied\nby higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Indeed,\na defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may\nhave a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of\nacquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard\nbargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty.\nViewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth\nCircuit improperly set aside a \u201creasonable state-court\ndeterminatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable inter\u00ad\npretation of the record.\u201d Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 335\n(2006).\n   Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 factual\ndetermination that respondent proclaimed innocence to\nToca, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s Strickland analysis cannot be\nsustained. Although a defendant\u2019s proclamation of inno\u00ad\ncence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibili\u00ad\nties under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel\ngives. The Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nToca\u2019s advice satisfied Strickland fell within the bounds of\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonableness under AEDPA, given that respondent was\nclaiming innocence and only days away from offering self\u00ad\nincriminating testimony in open court pursuant to a plea\nagreement involving an above-guidelines sentence.2 See\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) (explaining\nthat the defendant has the \u201c \u2018ultimate authority\u2019 \u201d to decide\nwhether to accept a plea bargain); Brookhart v. Janis, 384\nU. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1966) (observing that a lawyer must not\n\u201coverride his client\u2019s desire . . . to plead not guilty\u201d). The\nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was error.\n  Even more troubling is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nthat Toca was ineffective because the \u201crecord in this case\ncontains no evidence that\u201d he gave constitutionally ade\u00ad\nquate advice on whether to withdraw the guilty plea. 680\nF. 3d, at 590. We have said that counsel should be\n\u201cstrongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance\nand made all significant decisions in the exercise of rea\u00ad\nsonable professional judgment,\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690, and that the burden to \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s perfor\u00ad\nmance was deficient\u201d rests squarely on the defendant, id.,\nat 687. The Sixth Circuit turned that presumption of\neffectiveness on its head. It should go without saying that\nthe absence of evidence cannot overcome the \u201cstrong pre\u00ad\nsumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id., at 689.\nAs Chief Judge Batchelder correctly explained in her\ndissent, \u201c[w]ithout evidence that Toca gave incorrect ad\u00ad\nvice or evidence that he failed to give material advice,\nTitlow cannot establish that his performance was defi\u00ad\ncient.\u201d 680 F. 3d, at 595.\n  The Sixth Circuit pointed to a single fact in support of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We  assume, arguendo, as did the Michigan Court of Appeals, that\nToca went beyond facilitating respondent\u2019s withdrawal of the plea and\nadvised withdrawal, although we note that the sole basis in the record\nfor this assertion appears to be respondent\u2019s self-serving testimony.\n10                    BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits conclusion that Toca failed to adequately advise re\u00ad\nspondent: his failure to retrieve respondent\u2019s file from\nLustig before withdrawing the guilty plea. Id., at 590.\nBut here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from Strickland\u2019s\nstrong presumption of effectiveness. The record does not\nreveal how much Toca was able to glean about respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s case from other sources; he may well have obtained\ncopies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the\ncourt. (Indeed, Toca\u2019s statement at the plea withdrawal\nhearing that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a lot of material here\u201d strongly\nsuggests that he did have access to a source of documenta\u00ad\ntion other than Lustig\u2019s file. App. 71.)\n   In any event, the same considerations were relevant to\nentering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent\nadmitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that\nLustig had explained the State\u2019s evidence and that this\nevidence would support a conviction for first-degree mur\u00ad\nder. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to\nconclude that respondent understood the strength of the\nprosecution\u2019s case and nevertheless wished to withdraw\nthe plea. With respondent having knowingly entered the\nguilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of\nthe State\u2019s evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a\nmonth later highly unlikely.\n   Despite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal\njustification for overturning the state court\u2019s decision, we\nrecognize that Toca\u2019s conduct in this litigation was far\nfrom exemplary. He may well have violated the rules of\nprofessional conduct by accepting respondent\u2019s publication\nrights as partial payment for his services, and he waited\nweeks before consulting respondent\u2019s first lawyer about\nthe case. But the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee\nthe right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to\neffective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer\u2019s\nviolation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se\nineffective.

Troubling as Toca\u2019s actions were, they were irrele\u00ad\nvant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth\nCircuit: whether the state court reasonably determined\nthat respondent was adequately advised before deciding to\nwithdraw the guilty plea. Because the Michigan Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision that respondent was so advised is rea\u00ad\nsonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudgment is reversed.3\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Because we conclude that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding Toca\u2019s\n\nrepresentation constitutionally ineffective, we do not reach the other\nquestions presented by this case, namely, whether respondent ade\u00ad\nquately demonstrated prejudice, and whether the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nremedy is at odds with our decision in Lafler v.

VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   In my view, this case turns on Vonlee Titlow\u2019s failure to\npresent enough evidence of what Frederick Toca did or did\nnot do in the handful of days after she hired him and\nbefore she withdrew her plea. As our opinion notes, she\nbore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that\nToca performed effectively and that the state court ruled\ncorrectly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not\nsay more, and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join\nthe Court\u2019s opinion in full. I write separately, however, to\nexpress my understanding of our opinion\u2019s limited scope,\nparticularly with respect to two statements that it makes\nabout the adequacy of Toca\u2019s performance.\n   First, we state that \u201c[a]lthough a defendant\u2019s proclama-\ntion of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal\nresponsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice\ncounsel gives.\u201d Ante, at 8. The first part of that statement\nbears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant as-\nserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must\n\u201cmake an independent examination of the facts, circum-\nstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . . offer his\ninformed opinion as to what plea should be entered.\u201d Von\nMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 721 (1948) (plurality\nopinion). A defendant possesses \u201c \u2018the ultimate authority\u2019 \u201d\nto determine her plea. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175,\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n187 (2004). But a lawyer must abide by his client\u2019s deci-\nsion in this respect only after having provided the client\nwith competent and fully informed advice, including an\nanalysis of the risks that the client would face in proceed-\ning to trial. Given our recognition that \u201ca defendant\u2019s\nproclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his\nnormal responsibilities,\u201d ante, at 8, our further observa-\ntion that such a proclamation \u201cmay affect the advice coun-\nsel gives,\u201d ibid., states only the obvious: that a lawyer\u2019s\nadvice will always reflect the objectives of the representa-\ntion, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n   Second, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals to reject respondent\u2019s claim, \u201cgiven that\nrespondent was claiming innocence and only days away\nfrom offering self-incriminating testimony\u201d at her aunt\u2019s\ntrial. Ante, at 9. This is true in context: Because respond-\nent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca\u2019s per-\nformance was not adequate, the state court reasonably\nheld that it was. But our statement about the facts of this\ncase does not imply that an attorney performs effectively\nin advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever\nthe client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to\nmake the decision. Had respondent made a better factual\nrecord\u2014had she actually shown, for example, that Toca\nfailed to educate himself about the case before recom-\nmending that she withdraw her plea\u2014then she could well\nhave prevailed.\n   Because (and only because) respondent failed to present\nenough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of\nAEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the opinion of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

As the Court rightly observes, Toca\u2019s conduct\nwas \u201cfar from exemplary.\u201d Ante, at 10. With virtually no\ntime to make an assessment of Titlow\u2019s chances of prevail-\ning at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had\nnegotiated Titlow\u2019s plea, Toca told Titlow he could take\nthe case to trial and win. App. 295 (Titlow\u2019s uncontra-\ndicted averment). With Toca\u2019s aid, Titlow\u2019s plea was with-\ndrawn just three days after Toca\u2019s retention as defense\ncounsel. At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that\nTitlow had been the \u201cvictim of some bad advice.\u201d Id., at\n291.\n  Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear. The prosecu-\ntor\u2019s agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on\nTitlow\u2019s willingness to testify at her aunt\u2019s trial. See App.\n42\u201343, 45. Once Titlow reneged on that half of the deal,\nthe bargain failed. Absent an extant bargain, there was\nnothing to renew. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U.

In short, the prosecutor could\nnot be ordered to \u201crenew\u201d a plea proposal never offered in\nthe first place. With the plea offer no longer alive, Titlow\nwas convicted after a trial free from reversible error. See\nApp. 295. For these reasons, I join the Court\u2019s judgment.\n",

Argued October 8, 2013\u2014Decided November 5, 2013\nRespondent Titlow and Billie Rogers were arrested for the murder of\n  Billie\u2019s husband. After explaining to respondent that the State\u2019s evi-\n  dence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent\u2019s\n  attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agree-\n  ment to testify against Billie. Three days before Billie\u2019s trial, re-\n  spondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an\n  even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.\n  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the\n  original plea. Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted. Re-\n  spondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder. On\n  direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assis-\n  tance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn\n  the strength of the State\u2019s evidence. The Michigan Court of Appeals\n  rejected the claim, concluding that Toca\u2019s actions were reasonable in\n  light of his client\u2019s protestations of innocence. On federal habeas re-\n  view, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set\n  forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling was\n  reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief. The Sixth Circuit\n  reversed. It found the factual predicate for the state court\u2019s deci-\n  sion\u2014that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent\u2019s assertion\n  of innocence\u2014an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record,\n  given Toca\u2019s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision\n  to withdraw was made because the State\u2019s original plea offer was\n  higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guide-\n  lines. It also found no evidence in the record that Toca adequately\n  advised respondent of the consequences of withdrawal.\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit failed to apply the \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d stand-\n2                            BURT v.

Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___.\n    Pp. 4\u20136.\n       (b) Here, the record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap-\n    peals\u2019 factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea\n    only after respondent\u2019s proclamation of innocence. The facts that re-\n    spondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when\n    Billie\u2019s husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who ad-\n    vised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and\n    hired Toca just three days before Billie\u2019s trial at which respondent\n    had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had\n    second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed inno-\n    cence to Toca. The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its\n    contrary conclusion was that Toca\u2019s sole explanation at the with-\n    drawal hearing focused on the fact that the State\u2019s plea offer was\n    substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.\n    The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca\u2019s representa-\n    tions to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about\n    a defendant\u2019s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to\n    plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal\n    punishment on the other. Accepting as true the Michigan Court of\n    Appeals\u2019 factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence\n    to Toca, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.\n    More troubling is that court\u2019s conclusion that Toca was ineffective be-\n    cause the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally\n    adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea. The Sixth Circuit\n    turned on its head the principle that counsel should be \u201cstrongly pre-\n    sumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant\n    decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\u201d Strick-\n    land v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 690, with the burden to show oth-\n    erwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687. The single fact\n    that Toca failed to retrieve respondent\u2019s file from former counsel be-\n    fore withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Strickland\u2019s strong\n    presumption of effectiveness. In any event, respondent admitted in\n    open court that former counsel had explained the State\u2019s evidence\n    and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction.

Toca\u2019s conduct in this\n  litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer\u2019s ethical violations do\n  not make the lawyer per se ineffective, and Toca\u2019s questionable con-\n  duct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.\n  Pp. 6\u201311.\n680 F. 3d 577, reversed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When a state prisoner asks a federal court to set aside a\nsentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel during\nplea bargaining, our cases require that the federal court\nuse a \u201c \u2018doubly deferential\u2019 \u201d standard of review that gives\nboth the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of\nthe doubt. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 17). In this case, the Sixth Circuit failed to\napply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to\ncredit a state court\u2019s reasonable factual finding and by\nassuming that counsel was ineffective where the record\nwas silent. Because the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), do not\npermit federal judges to so casually second-guess the\ndecisions of their state-court colleagues or defense attor\u00ad\nneys, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision must be reversed.\n                           I\n  Respondent Titlow and Billie Rogers, respondent\u2019s aunt,\nmurdered Billie\u2019s husband Don by pouring vodka down his\nthroat and smothering him with a pillow. With help from\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nattorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agree\u00ad\nment with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead\nguilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sen\u00ad\ntence. As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the\nState\u2019s evidence with respondent \u201cover a long period of\ntime,\u201d and respondent understood that that evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. App. 43\u201344.\nThe Michigan trial court approved the plea bargain.\n   Three days before Billie Rogers\u2019 trial was to commence,\nhowever, respondent retained a new lawyer, Frederick\nToca. With Toca\u2019s help, respondent demanded a substan\u00ad\ntially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of\nseven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and\ntestify. When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new\ndemands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging\nin open court the consequences of withdrawal (including\nreinstatement of the first-degree murder charge). Without\nrespondent\u2019s critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquit\u00ad\nted, and later died.\n   Respondent subsequently stood trial. During the course\nof the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don\nRogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered\nhis mouth or poured vodka down his throat, that Billie\nintended to harm him. Indeed, respondent testified to\nattempting to prevent Billie from harming her husband.\nThe jury, however, elected to believe respondent\u2019s previous\nout-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated\nparticipation in the killing, and convicted respondent of\nsecond-degree murder. The trial court imposed a 20- to\n40-year term of imprisonment.\n   On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca advised\nwithdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn\nmore about the case, thereby failing to realize the strength\nof the State\u2019s evidence and providing ineffective assistance\nof counsel. Rejecting that claim, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals found that Toca acted reasonably in light of his\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

That court found that\nrespondent\u2019s decision to hire Toca was \u201cset in motion\u201d by\nrespondent\u2019s \u201cstatement to a sheriff \u2019s deputy that [re\u00ad\nspondent] did not commit the offense.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 101a. Applying the standard set forth by our deci\u00ad\nsion in Strickland, which requires that defense counsel\nsatisfy \u201can objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d 466\nU. S., at 688, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded\nthat \u201c[w]hen a defendant proclaims . . . innocence . . . , it is\nnot objectively unreasonable to recommend that the de\u00ad\nfendant refrain from pleading guilty\u2014no matter how\n\u2018good\u2019 the deal may appear.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a.\n   Respondent then filed a federal habeas petition under\n28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. Applying AEDPA\u2019s deferential stand\u00ad\nard of review, the District Court concluded that the Michi\u00ad\ngan Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling was \u201ccompletely reasonable\non the law and the facts\u201d and denied relief. No. 07\u2013CV\u2013\n13614, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4115410</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *15 (ED Mich., Oct. 19, 2010).\nIn particular, the District Court concluded that \u201c[c]ounsel\ncould not be ineffective by trying to negotiate a better plea\nagreement for [Titlow] with Billie Rogers\u2019s trial imminent\nand [Titlow] stating at the time that Billie Rogers had\ncommitted the murder without . . . assistance.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Sixth Circuit reversed. It found that the factual\npredicate for the state court\u2019s decision\u2014that the with\u00ad\ndrawal of the plea was based on respondent\u2019s assertion of\ninnocence\u2014was an unreasonable interpretation of the\nfactual record, given Toca\u2019s explanation at the withdrawal\nhearing that \u201cthe decision to withdraw Titlow\u2019s plea was\nbased on the fact that the State\u2019s plea offer was substan\u00ad\ntially higher than the Michigan guidelines for second\u00ad\ndegree murder.\u201d 680 F. 3d 577, 589 (2012). Further\nobserving that \u201c[t]he record in this case contains no evi\u00ad\ndence\u201d that Toca fully informed respondent of the possible\nconsequences of withdrawing the guilty plea, the Sixth\nCircuit held that Toca rendered ineffective assistance of\n4                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncounsel that resulted in respondent\u2019s loss of the benefit of\nthe plea bargain. Id., at 589\u2013592. Citing our decision in\nLafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), the Sixth Circuit\nremanded this case with instructions that the prosecution\nmust reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent,\nand that the state court should \u201cconsul[t]\u201d the plea agree\u00ad\nment and \u201cfashion\u201d a remedy for the violation of respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\ncounsel during plea bargaining. 680 F. 3d, at 592. Chief\nJudge Batchelder dissented on the grounds that the Mich\u00ad\nigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision was reasonable. Id., at\n593.\n  On remand, the prosecution followed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\ninstructions and reoffered the plea agreement it had of\u00ad\nfered some 10 years before\u2014even though, in light of Billie\nRogers\u2019 acquittal and subsequent death, respondent was\nno longer able to deliver on the promises originally made\nto the prosecution. At the plea hearing, however, re\u00ad\nspondent balked, refusing to provide a factual basis for the\nplea which the court could accept. Respondent admitted\nto pouring vodka down Don Rogers\u2019 throat, but denied\nassisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka\ndown his throat could lead to his death. As at trial, re\u00ad\nspondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie Rogers\nfrom harming her husband. Eventually, after conferring\nwith current counsel (not Toca), respondent admitted to\nplacing Don Rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his\nthroat with the knowledge that his death could result.\nThe trial court took the plea under advisement, where the\nmatter stands at present. We granted certiorari. 568\nU. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n  AEDPA instructs that, when a federal habeas petitioner\nchallenges the factual basis for a prior state-court decision\nrejecting a claim, the federal court may overturn the state\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

We have not defined the precise relationship\nbetween \u00a72254(d)(2) and \u00a72254(e)(1), and we need not do\nso here. See Wood v. Allen, 558 U. S. 290, 293 (2010). For\npresent purposes, it is enough to reiterate \u201cthat a state\u00ad\ncourt factual determination is not unreasonable merely\nbecause the federal habeas court would have reached a\ndifferent conclusion in the first instance.\u201d Id., at 301.\nAEDPA likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for\nreviewing claims of legal error by the state courts: A writ\nof habeas corpus may issue only if the state court\u2019s deci\u00ad\nsion \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable appli\u00ad\ncation of, clearly established Federal law, as determined\nby\u201d this Court. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   AEDPA recognizes a foundational principle of our fed-\neral system: State courts are adequate forums for the vindi-\ncation of federal rights. \u201c[T]he States possess sovereignty\nconcurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject\nonly to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.\nUnder this system of dual sovereignty, we have consist-\nently held that state courts have inherent authority, and\nare thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims\narising under the laws of the United States.\u201d Tafflin v.\nLevitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990). This principle applies to\nclaimed violations of constitutional, as well as statutory,\nrights. See Trainor v. Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 443\n(1977). Indeed, \u201cstate courts have the solemn responsibil\u00ad\nity equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitu\u00ad\ntional rights,\u201d and this Court has refused to sanction any\ndecision that would \u201creflec[t] negatively upon [a] state\ncourt\u2019s ability to do so.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Especially where a case involves such a common\n6                     BURT v.

Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 494, n. 35 (1976) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n  Recognizing the duty and ability of our state-court\ncolleagues to adjudicate claims of constitutional wrong,\nAEDPA erects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief\nfor prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state\ncourt. AEDPA requires \u201ca state prisoner [to] show that\nthe state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in\nfederal court was so lacking in justification that there was\nan error . . . beyond any possibility for fairminded disa\u00ad\ngreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 13). \u201cIf this standard is difficult to\nmeet\u201d\u2014and it is\u2014\u201cthat is because it was meant to be.\u201d\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We will not lightly conclude\nthat a State\u2019s criminal justice system has experienced the\n\u201cextreme malfunctio[n]\u201d for which federal habeas relief is\nthe remedy. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n                             III\n  The record readily supports the Michigan Court of Ap\u00ad\npeals\u2019 factual finding that Toca advised withdrawal of the\nguilty plea only after respondent\u2019s proclamation of inno\u00ad\ncence. Respondent passed a polygraph denying planning\nto kill Don Rogers or being in the room when he died.\nThereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, re\u00ad\nspondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).1 That\nconversation \u201cset into motion\u201d respondent\u2019s decision to\nretain Toca. Ibid., \u00b68. Those facts, together with the\ntiming of Toca\u2019s hiring\u2014on the eve of the trial at which\nrespondent was to self-incriminate\u2014strongly suggest that\nrespondent had second thoughts about confessing in open\ncourt and proclaimed innocence to Toca. That conclusion\nis further bolstered by respondent\u2019s maintenance of inno\u00ad\ncence of Don Rogers\u2019 death at trial.\n   Indeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult.\nRespondent\u2019s first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal\nthat was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by\nrespondent in open court, that the State\u2019s evidence could\nsupport a conviction for first-degree murder. This deal\ninvolved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year\nsentence\u2014far less than the mandatory sentence of life in\nprison that results from a conviction for first-degree mur\u00ad\nder under Michigan law. See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.\n\u00a7750.316 (West Supp. 2013). Yet after a jailer advised\nagainst pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty, some-\nthing caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca\n(who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and\nthen to maintain innocence at trial. If that something was\nnot a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine\nwhat it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative\ntheory.\n   The only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclu\u00ad\nsion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondent complains that the state court improperly relied on this\n\naffidavit, but it was respondent who provided the affidavit to the state\ncourt and asked it to rely on the affidavit as part of the ground for\nremanding for an evidentiary hearing. In any event, even if the state\ncourt used the affidavit for a purpose not permitted by state law\u2014a\nproposition we do not endorse\u2014that would not empower a federal court\nto grant habeas relief. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991).\n8                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoved to withdraw the guilty plea, he \u201cdid not refer to\nTitlow\u2019s claims of innocence,\u201d but instead \u201cexplained that\nthe decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact\nthat the State\u2019s plea offer was substantially higher than\nthe Michigan guidelines\u201d for manslaughter. 680 F. 3d, at\n589. The Sixth Circuit believed that this fact \u201csufficiently\nrebuts the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 finding that the\nplea withdrawal was based on Titlow\u2019s assertion of inno\u00ad\ncence.\u201d Ibid.\n   But the Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of\nToca\u2019s representations to the trial court, noting in its\nopinion that respondent \u201cmoved to withdraw [the] plea\nbecause the agreed upon sentence exceeded the sentencing\nguidelines range.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a. The Michi\u00ad\ngan Court of Appeals, however\u2014unlike the Sixth Circuit\u2014\nalso correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent\nabout a defendant\u2019s asserting innocence on the one hand\nand refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied\nby higher-than-normal punishment on the other. Indeed,\na defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may\nhave a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of\nacquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard\nbargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty.\nViewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth\nCircuit improperly set aside a \u201creasonable state-court\ndeterminatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable inter\u00ad\npretation of the record.\u201d Rice v. Collins, 546 U. S. 333, 335\n(2006).\n   Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 factual\ndetermination that respondent proclaimed innocence to\nToca, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s Strickland analysis cannot be\nsustained. Although a defendant\u2019s proclamation of inno\u00ad\ncence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibili\u00ad\nties under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel\ngives. The Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that\nToca\u2019s advice satisfied Strickland fell within the bounds of\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nreasonableness under AEDPA, given that respondent was\nclaiming innocence and only days away from offering self\u00ad\nincriminating testimony in open court pursuant to a plea\nagreement involving an above-guidelines sentence.2 See\nFlorida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) (explaining\nthat the defendant has the \u201c \u2018ultimate authority\u2019 \u201d to decide\nwhether to accept a plea bargain); Brookhart v. Janis, 384\nU. S. 1, 7\u20138 (1966) (observing that a lawyer must not\n\u201coverride his client\u2019s desire . . . to plead not guilty\u201d). The\nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was error.\n  Even more troubling is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion\nthat Toca was ineffective because the \u201crecord in this case\ncontains no evidence that\u201d he gave constitutionally ade\u00ad\nquate advice on whether to withdraw the guilty plea. 680\nF. 3d, at 590. We have said that counsel should be\n\u201cstrongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance\nand made all significant decisions in the exercise of rea\u00ad\nsonable professional judgment,\u201d Strickland, 466 U. S., at\n690, and that the burden to \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s perfor\u00ad\nmance was deficient\u201d rests squarely on the defendant, id.,\nat 687. The Sixth Circuit turned that presumption of\neffectiveness on its head. It should go without saying that\nthe absence of evidence cannot overcome the \u201cstrong pre\u00ad\nsumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide\nrange of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id., at 689.\nAs Chief Judge Batchelder correctly explained in her\ndissent, \u201c[w]ithout evidence that Toca gave incorrect ad\u00ad\nvice or evidence that he failed to give material advice,\nTitlow cannot establish that his performance was defi\u00ad\ncient.\u201d 680 F. 3d, at 595.\n  The Sixth Circuit pointed to a single fact in support of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We  assume, arguendo, as did the Michigan Court of Appeals, that\nToca went beyond facilitating respondent\u2019s withdrawal of the plea and\nadvised withdrawal, although we note that the sole basis in the record\nfor this assertion appears to be respondent\u2019s self-serving testimony.\n10                    BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits conclusion that Toca failed to adequately advise re\u00ad\nspondent: his failure to retrieve respondent\u2019s file from\nLustig before withdrawing the guilty plea. Id., at 590.\nBut here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from Strickland\u2019s\nstrong presumption of effectiveness. The record does not\nreveal how much Toca was able to glean about respond\u00ad\nent\u2019s case from other sources; he may well have obtained\ncopies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the\ncourt. (Indeed, Toca\u2019s statement at the plea withdrawal\nhearing that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a lot of material here\u201d strongly\nsuggests that he did have access to a source of documenta\u00ad\ntion other than Lustig\u2019s file. App. 71.)\n   In any event, the same considerations were relevant to\nentering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent\nadmitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that\nLustig had explained the State\u2019s evidence and that this\nevidence would support a conviction for first-degree mur\u00ad\nder. Toca was justified in relying on this admission to\nconclude that respondent understood the strength of the\nprosecution\u2019s case and nevertheless wished to withdraw\nthe plea. With respondent having knowingly entered the\nguilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of\nthe State\u2019s evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a\nmonth later highly unlikely.\n   Despite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal\njustification for overturning the state court\u2019s decision, we\nrecognize that Toca\u2019s conduct in this litigation was far\nfrom exemplary. He may well have violated the rules of\nprofessional conduct by accepting respondent\u2019s publication\nrights as partial payment for his services, and he waited\nweeks before consulting respondent\u2019s first lawyer about\nthe case. But the Sixth Amendment does not guarantee\nthe right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to\neffective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer\u2019s\nviolation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se\nineffective.

Troubling as Toca\u2019s actions were, they were irrele\u00ad\nvant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth\nCircuit: whether the state court reasonably determined\nthat respondent was adequately advised before deciding to\nwithdraw the guilty plea. Because the Michigan Court of\nAppeals\u2019 decision that respondent was so advised is rea\u00ad\nsonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\njudgment is reversed.3\n                                           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Because we conclude that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding Toca\u2019s\n\nrepresentation constitutionally ineffective, we do not reach the other\nquestions presented by this case, namely, whether respondent ade\u00ad\nquately demonstrated prejudice, and whether the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\nremedy is at odds with our decision in Lafler v.

VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, concurring.\n   In my view, this case turns on Vonlee Titlow\u2019s failure to\npresent enough evidence of what Frederick Toca did or did\nnot do in the handful of days after she hired him and\nbefore she withdrew her plea. As our opinion notes, she\nbore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that\nToca performed effectively and that the state court ruled\ncorrectly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not\nsay more, and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join\nthe Court\u2019s opinion in full. I write separately, however, to\nexpress my understanding of our opinion\u2019s limited scope,\nparticularly with respect to two statements that it makes\nabout the adequacy of Toca\u2019s performance.\n   First, we state that \u201c[a]lthough a defendant\u2019s proclama-\ntion of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal\nresponsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice\ncounsel gives.\u201d Ante, at 8. The first part of that statement\nbears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant as-\nserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must\n\u201cmake an independent examination of the facts, circum-\nstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . . offer his\ninformed opinion as to what plea should be entered.\u201d Von\nMoltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 721 (1948) (plurality\nopinion). A defendant possesses \u201c \u2018the ultimate authority\u2019 \u201d\nto determine her plea. Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175,\n2                     BURT v. TITLOW\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\n187 (2004). But a lawyer must abide by his client\u2019s deci-\nsion in this respect only after having provided the client\nwith competent and fully informed advice, including an\nanalysis of the risks that the client would face in proceed-\ning to trial. Given our recognition that \u201ca defendant\u2019s\nproclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his\nnormal responsibilities,\u201d ante, at 8, our further observa-\ntion that such a proclamation \u201cmay affect the advice coun-\nsel gives,\u201d ibid., states only the obvious: that a lawyer\u2019s\nadvice will always reflect the objectives of the representa-\ntion, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n   Second, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals to reject respondent\u2019s claim, \u201cgiven that\nrespondent was claiming innocence and only days away\nfrom offering self-incriminating testimony\u201d at her aunt\u2019s\ntrial. Ante, at 9. This is true in context: Because respond-\nent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca\u2019s per-\nformance was not adequate, the state court reasonably\nheld that it was. But our statement about the facts of this\ncase does not imply that an attorney performs effectively\nin advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever\nthe client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to\nmake the decision. Had respondent made a better factual\nrecord\u2014had she actually shown, for example, that Toca\nfailed to educate himself about the case before recom-\nmending that she withdraw her plea\u2014then she could well\nhave prevailed.\n   Because (and only because) respondent failed to present\nenough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of\nAEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the opinion of the\nCourt.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

BURT, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VONLEE\n                NICOLE TITLOW\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [November 5, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, concurring in the judgment.\n  While I join the Court\u2019s judgment, I find dubious the\nMichigan Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that Toca acted\nreasonably in light of Titlow\u2019s protestations of innocence.\nToca became Titlow\u2019s counsel on the recommendation of\nthe deputy sheriff to whom Titlow professed innocence.\nApp. 298. As the Court rightly observes, Toca\u2019s conduct\nwas \u201cfar from exemplary.\u201d Ante, at 10. With virtually no\ntime to make an assessment of Titlow\u2019s chances of prevail-\ning at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had\nnegotiated Titlow\u2019s plea, Toca told Titlow he could take\nthe case to trial and win. App. 295 (Titlow\u2019s uncontra-\ndicted averment). With Toca\u2019s aid, Titlow\u2019s plea was with-\ndrawn just three days after Toca\u2019s retention as defense\ncounsel. At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that\nTitlow had been the \u201cvictim of some bad advice.\u201d Id., at\n291.\n  Nevertheless, one thing is crystal clear. The prosecu-\ntor\u2019s agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on\nTitlow\u2019s willingness to testify at her aunt\u2019s trial. See App.\n42\u201343, 45. Once Titlow reneged on that half of the deal,\nthe bargain failed. Absent an extant bargain, there was\nnothing to renew. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U. S.\n129, 137 (2009) (\u201cAlthough the analogy may not hold in\nall respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts. . . .\n2                      BURT v. TITLOW\n\n              GINSBURG, J., concurring in judgment\n\n[W]hen one of the exchanged promises is not kept . . . we\nsay that the contract was broken.\u201d); Scott & Stuntz, Plea\nBargaining as Contract, 101 Yale L. J. 1909, 1953 (1992)\n(\u201cWhen defendants promise to plead guilty in return for\ngovernment concessions and then do so, they are legally\nentitled to the concessions. At the same time, if the de-\nfendant fails to perform, the prosecutor need not perform\neither.\u201d (footnote omitted)). In short, the prosecutor could\nnot be ordered to \u201crenew\u201d a plea proposal never offered in\nthe first place. With the plea offer no longer alive, Titlow\nwas convicted after a trial free from reversible error. See\nApp. 295. For these reasons, I join the Court\u2019s judgment.\n</pre>",
