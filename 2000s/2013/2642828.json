ALABAMA\n    ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT\n\n            OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF ALABAMA\n\n              No. 13\u20135380    Decided November 18, 2013\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE BREYER joins\nas to Parts I and II, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   The jury that convicted Mario Dion Woodward of capital\nmurder voted 8 to 4 against imposing the death penalty.\nBut the trial judge overrode the jury\u2019s decision and sen-\ntenced Woodward to death after hearing new evidence and\nfinding, contrary to the jury\u2019s prior determination of the\nsame question, that the aggravating circumstances out-\nweighed the mitigating circumstances. The judge was\nstatutorily entitled to do this under Alabama law, which\nprovides that a jury\u2019s decision as to whether a defendant\nshould be executed is merely an \u201cadvisory verdict\u201d that the\ntrial judge may override if she disagrees with the jury\u2019s\nconclusion. In the last decade, Alabama has been the only\nState in which judges have imposed the death penalty in\nthe face of contrary jury verdicts. Since Alabama adopted\nits current statute, its judges have imposed death sen-\ntences on 95 defendants contrary to a jury\u2019s verdict.1 Forty-\nthree of these defendants remain on death row today.\nBecause I harbor deep concerns about whether this prac-\ntice offends the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, I would\ngrant Woodward\u2019s petition for certiorari so that the Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 A list of these 95 defendants sentenced to death after a jury verdict\n\nof life imprisonment is produced in an appendix to this opinion. By\ncontrast, where juries have voted to impose the death penalty, Alabama\njudges have overridden that verdict in favor of a life sentence only nine\ntimes.\n2                 WOODWARD v. ALABAMA\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncould give this issue the close attention that it deserves.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   In Alabama, a defendant convicted of capital murder is\nentitled to an evidentiary sentencing hearing before a\njury. Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u201345, 13A\u20135\u201346 (2005). At that\nhearing, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthe existence of at least one aggravating circumstance;\notherwise, the defendant cannot be sentenced to death and\ninstead receives a sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole. \u00a713A\u20135\u201345(e),(f). The defendant may present\nmitigating circumstances, which the State may seek to\ndisprove by a preponderance of the evidence. \u00a713A\u20135\u2013\n45(g). If it has found at least one aggravating circum-\nstance, the jury then weighs the aggravating and mitigat-\ning evidence and renders its advisory verdict. If it finds\nthat the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the\nmitigating circumstances, the jury must return a life-\nwithout-parole verdict; if it finds that the aggravating\ncircumstances do outweigh the mitigating circumstances,\nit must return a death verdict. \u00a713A\u20135\u201346(e). A life-\nwithout-parole verdict requires a vote of a majority of the\njurors, while a death verdict requires a vote of at least 10\njurors. \u00a713A\u20135\u201346(f).\n   After the jury returns its advisory verdict, the trial\njudge makes her own determination whether the aggra-\nvating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circum-\nstances and imposes a sentence accordingly. \u00a713A\u20135\u201347.\nAlabama\u2019s statute provides that \u201c[w]hile the jury\u2019s rec-\nommendation concerning [the] sentence shall be given\nconsideration, it is not binding upon the court.\u201d\n\u00a713A\u20135\u201347(e).\n                          B\n    Woodward was convicted of capital murder for fatally\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

It\ntherefore recommended a sentence of life imprisonment\nwithout parole.\n  The trial judge conducted his own sentencing proceed-\ning. At that hearing, the State presented additional evi-\ndence concerning the mitigating circumstances presented\nto the jury. The trial judge, in part on the basis of the new\nevidence, rejected the jury\u2019s finding. Making his own\ndetermination that the aggravating circumstances out-\nweighed the mitigating circumstances, the judge imposed\nthe death penalty, thereby overriding the jury\u2019s prior\nadvisory verdict of life without parole. The Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals affirmed Woodward\u2019s conviction\nand sentence, 2011 WL 6278294 (Aug. 24, 2012), and the\nAlabama Supreme Court denied certiorari.\n                              II\n   This Court has long acknowledged that death is funda-\nmentally different in kind from any other punishment.\nSee Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 286\u2013291 (1972)\n(Brennan, J., concurring); Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,\n188 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\nJJ.). For that reason, we have required States to apply\nspecial procedural safeguards to \u201cminimize the risk of\nwholly arbitrary and capricious action\u201d in imposing the\ndeath penalty. Gregg, 428 U. S., at 189, 195 (joint opinion\nof Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); see also Ring v.\nArizona, 536 U. S. 584, 614 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring\nin judgment) (explaining that without adequate proce-\ndural safeguards, \u201cthe constitutional prohibition against\n\u2018cruel and unusual punishments\u2019 would forbid [the] use\u201d of\nthe death penalty). One such safeguard, as determined by\nthe vast majority of States, is that a jury, and not a judge,\n4                     WOODWARD v. ALABAMA\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nshould impose any sentence of death.2\n   Of the 32 States that currently authorize capital pun-\nishment, 31 require jury participation in the sentencing\ndecision; only Montana leaves the jury with no sentencing\nrole in capital cases. See Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a746\u201318\u2013301,\n46\u201318\u2013305 (2013). In 27 of those 31 States, plus the fed-\neral system, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73593, the jury\u2019s decision to im-\npose life imprisonment is final and may not be disturbed\nby the trial judge under any circumstance. That leaves\nfour States in which the jury has a role in sentencing but\nis not the final decisionmaker. In Nebraska, the jury is\nresponsible for finding aggravating circumstances, while a\nthree-judge panel determines mitigating circumstances\nand weighs them against the aggravating circumstances\nto make the ultimate sentencing decision. See Neb. Rev.\nStat. \u00a7\u00a729\u20132520, 29\u20132521 (2008). Three States\u2014Alabama,\nDelaware, and Florida\u2014permit the trial judge to override\nthe jury\u2019s sentencing decision.\n  In Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447 (1984), we upheld\nFlorida\u2019s judicial-override sentencing statute. And in\nHarris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504 (1995), we upheld Ala-\nbama\u2019s similar statute. Eighteen years have passed since\nwe decided Harris, and in my view, the time has come for\nus to reconsider that decision. Cf. Roper, 543 U. S., at 555\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 It is perhaps unsurprising that the national consensus has moved\n\ntowards a capital sentencing scheme in which the jury is responsible for\nimposing capital punishment. Because \u201c \u2018capital punishment is an\nexpression of society\u2019s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct,\u2019 \u201d\nHarris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 518 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting),\njurors, who \u201cexpress the conscience of the community on the ultimate\nquestion of life or death,\u201d Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 519\n(1968), seem best-positioned to decide whether the need for retribution\nin a particular case mandates imposition of the death penalty. See\nHarris, 513 U. S., at 518 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201cA capital sentence\nexpresses the community\u2019s judgment that no lesser sanction will\nprovide an adequate response to the defendant\u2019s outrageous affront to\nhumanity\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(reconsidering after 16 years the issue decided in Stanford\nv. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989)); Atkins v. Virginia, 536\nU. S. 304, 307 (2002) (reconsidering after 13 years the\nissue decided in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989)).\n   In the nearly two decades since we decided Harris, the\npractice of judicial overrides has become increasingly rare.\nIn the 1980\u2019s, there were 125 life-to-death overrides: 89 in\nFlorida, 30 in Alabama, and 6 in Indiana. In the 1990\u2019s,\nthere were 74: 26 in Florida, 44 in Alabama, and 4 in\nIndiana.3 Since 2000, by contrast, there have been only 27\nlife-to-death overrides, 26 of which were by Alabama\njudges.4\n\n\n\n\n  As these statistics demonstrate, Alabama has become a\nclear outlier. Among the four States that permitted judi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 See Radelet, Overriding Jury Sentencing Recommendations in Flor-\n\nida Capital Cases: An Update and Possible Half-Requiem, 2011 Mich.\nState L. Rev. 793, 818 (2011) (listing overrides in Indiana); id., at 828\n(listing overrides in Florida); id., at 825\u2013827 (listing overrides in\nAlabama).\n   4 The 27th death sentence by judicial override, which occurred in\n\nDelaware, was eventually reduced to a life sentence. See n. 5, infra.\n6                    WOODWARD v. ALABAMA\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncial overrides at the time of Harris, Alabama now stands\nas the only one in which judges continue to override jury\nverdicts of life without parole. One of the four States,\nIndiana, no longer permits life-to-death judicial overrides\nat all. See Ind. Code \u00a735\u201350\u20132\u20139(e) (2004). Only one\ndefendant in Delaware has ever been condemned to death\nby a judicial life-to-death override, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court overturned his sentence.5 And no Florida\njudge has overridden a jury\u2019s verdict of a life sentence\nsince 1999.6 In sum, whereas judges across three States\noverrode roughly 10 jury verdicts per year in the 1980\u2019s\nand 1990\u2019s, a dramatic shift has taken place over the past\ndecade: Judges now override jury verdicts of life in just a\nsingle State, and they do so roughly twice a year.\n   What could explain Alabama judges\u2019 distinctive procliv-\nity for imposing death sentences in cases where a jury has\nalready rejected that penalty? There is no evidence that\ncriminal activity is more heinous in Alabama than in other\nStates, or that Alabama juries are particularly lenient in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 One Delaware judge has used the override to impose a death sen-\n\ntence in two cases involving the same defendant. On appeal, the\nDelaware Supreme Court twice vacated the death sentence, and ulti-\nmately ordered the trial court to impose a life sentence. See Garden v.\nState, 815 A. 2d 327, 331\u2013333 (2003); Garden v. State, 844 A. 2d 311,\n318 (2004).\n   6 Even after this Court upheld Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme in\n\nSpaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447 (1984), the practice of judicial\noverrides consistently declined in that State. Since 1972, 166 death\nsentences have been imposed in Florida following a jury recommenda-\ntion of life imprisonment. Between 1973 and 1989, an average of eight\npeople was sentenced to death on an override each year. That average\nnumber dropped by 50 percent between 1990 and 1994, and by an\nadditional 70 percent from 1995 to 1999. The practice then stopped\ncompletely. It has been more than 14 years since the last life-to-death\noverride in Florida; the last person sentenced to death after a jury\nrecommendation of life imprisonment was Jeffrey Weaver, sentenced in\nAugust 1999.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

The\nonly answer that is supported by empirical evidence is one\nthat, in my view, casts a cloud of illegitimacy over the\ncriminal justice system: Alabama judges, who are elected\nin partisan proceedings, appear to have succumbed to\nelectoral pressures. See Symposium, Politics and the\nDeath Penalty: Can Rational Discourse and Due Process\nSurvive the Perceived Political Pressure? 21 Fordham\nUrban L. J. 239, 256 (1994) (comments of Bryan Steven-\nson) (concluding, based on \u201ca mini-multiple regression\nanalysis of how the death penalty is applied and how\noverride is applied, [that] there is a statistically significant\ncorrelation between judicial override and election years\nin most of the counties where these overrides take\nplace\u201d); see also Equal Justice Initiative, The Death Penalty\nin Alabama: Judge Override, at 16, http://eji.org/files/\nOverride_Report.pdf (as visited on November 15, 2013,\nand available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (hereinafter\nOverride Report) (noting that the proportion of death\nsentences imposed by override in Alabama is elevated in\nelection years). One Alabama judge, who has overridden\njury verdicts to impose the death penalty on six occasions,\ncampaigned by running several advertisements voicing his\nsupport for capital punishment. One of these ads boasted\nthat he had \u201c \u2018presided over more than 9,000 cases, includ-\ning some of the most heinous murder trials in our his-\ntory,\u2019 \u201d and expressly named some of the defendants\nwhom he had sentenced to death, in at least one case over\na jury\u2019s contrary judgment. Override Report 16. With\nadmirable candor, another judge, who has overridden one\njury verdict to impose death, admitted that voter reaction\ndoes \u201c \u2018have some impact, especially in high-profile cases.\u2019 \u201d\nVelasco, More Judges Issue Death Despite Jury, Birming-\nham News, July 17, 2011, p. 11A. \u201c \u2018Let\u2019s face it,\u2019 \u201d the\njudge said, \u201c \u2018we\u2019re human beings.

S., at 520 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n   By permitting a single trial judge\u2019s view to displace that\nof a jury representing a cross-section of the community,\nAlabama\u2019s sentencing scheme has led to curious and\npotentially arbitrary outcomes. For example, Alabama\njudges frequently override jury life-without-parole verdicts\neven in cases where the jury was unanimous in that ver-\ndict.7 In many cases, judges have done so without offering\na meaningful explanation for the decision to disregard the\njury\u2019s verdict. In sentencing a defendant with an IQ of 65,\nfor example, one judge concluded that \u201c \u2018[t]he sociological\nliterature suggests Gypsies intentionally test low on\nstandard IQ tests.\u2019 \u201d 8 Override Report 20 (quoting Sen-\ntencing Order in State v. Neal, No. 87\u2013520 (Baldwin Cty\nCir. Ct., May 17, 1990)). Another judge, who was facing\nreelection at the time he sentenced a 19-year-old defend-\nant, refused to consider certain mitigating circumstances\nfound by the jury, which had voted to recommend a life-\nwithout-parole sentence. He explained his sensitivity to\npublic perception as follows: \u201c \u2018If I had not imposed the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    7 As\n       recently as May 2011, an Alabama judge overrode a 12-to-0 jury\nverdict to sentence Courtney Lockhart to death. Lockhart, a former\narmy soldier and Iraq war veteran, was convicted of murdering a\ncollege student, Lauren Burk. The jury recommended life imprison-\nment without the possibility of parole, influenced by mitigating circum-\nstances relating to severe psychological problems Lockhart suffered as\na result of his combat in Iraq. (Lockhart spent 16 months in Iraq; 64 of\nthe soldiers in his brigade never made it home, including Lockhart\u2019s\nbest friend. The soldiers who survived all exhibited signs of posttrau-\nmatic stress disorder and other psychological conditions. Twelve of\nthem have been arrested for murder or attempted murder.). The trial\njudge nonetheless imposed the death penalty.\n  8 After this sentence was reversed on appeal, the State agreed that\n\nthe defendant was exempt from the death penalty because he is men-\ntally retarded.

Waldrop, No. 98\u2013\n162 (Randolph Cty Cir. Ct., July 25, 2000)). These results\ndo not seem to square with our Eighth Amendment juris-\nprudence, see Furman, 408 U. S., at 274 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cIn determining whether a punishment com-\nports with human dignity, we are aided by [the principle]\nthat the State must not arbitrarily inflict a severe pun-\nishment\u201d); Gregg, 428 U. S., at 188 (joint opinion of Stew-\nart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (\u201cFurman held that [the\ndeath penalty] could not be imposed under sentencing\nprocedures that created a substantial risk that it would be\ninflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner\u201d), and they\nraise important concerns that are worthy of this Court\u2019s\nreview.\n                             III\n   There is a second reason why Alabama\u2019s sentencing\nscheme deserves our review. Since our decisions in Spazi-\nano and Harris, our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence has\ndeveloped significantly. Five years after we decided Har-\nris, we held in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466\n(2000), that the Sixth Amendment does not permit a de-\nfendant to be \u201cexpose[d] . . . to a penalty exceeding the\nmaximum he would receive if punished according to the\nfacts reflected in the jury verdict alone.\u201d Id., at 483 (em-\nphasis deleted). When \u201ca State makes an increase in a\ndefendant\u2019s authorized punishment contingent on the\nfinding of fact,\u201d we explained, \u201cthat fact\u2014no matter how\nthe State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\u201d Ring, 536 U. S., at 602 (citing Appren-\ndi, 530 U. S., at 482\u2013483); see also id., at 499 (SCALIA, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201c[A]ll the facts which must exist in order to\nsubject the defendant to a legally prescribed punishment\nmust be found by the jury\u201d).\n10               WOODWARD v. ALABAMA\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Two years later, we applied the Apprendi rule in Ring v.\nArizona to invalidate Arizona\u2019s capital sentencing scheme,\nwhich permitted the trial judge to determine the presence\nof aggravating factors required for imposition of the death\npenalty. 536 U. S., at 609. We made clear that \u201c[c]apital\ndefendants, no less than noncapital defendants, . . . are\nentitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the\nlegislature conditions an increase in their maximum pun-\nishment.\u201d Id., at 589. And we overruled our earlier deci-\nsion in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), by holding\nthat the jury\u2014not the judge\u2014must find an aggravating\ncircumstance that is necessary for the imposition of the\ndeath penalty. Ring, 536 U. S., at 609. \u201cBecause Arizo-\nna\u2019s enumerated aggravating factors operate as \u2018the func-\ntional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,\u2019 \u201d we\nexplained, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment requires that they be\nfound by a jury.\u201d Ibid. (quoting Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n494, n. 19).\n   The very principles that animated our decisions in\nApprendi and Ring call into doubt the validity of Ala-\nbama\u2019s capital sentencing scheme. Alabama permits a\ndefendant to present mitigating circumstances that weigh\nagainst imposition of the death penalty. See Ala. Code\n\u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u201351, 13A\u20135\u201352. Indeed, we have long held that a\ndefendant has a constitutional right to present mitigating\nevidence in capital cases. See Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\nU. S. 104, 110 (1982). And a defendant is eligible for the\ndeath penalty in Alabama only upon a specific factual\nfinding that any aggravating factors outweigh the mitigat-\ning factors he has presented. See Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u2013\n46(e), 13A\u20135\u201347(e). The statutorily required finding that\nthe aggravating factors of a defendant\u2019s crime outweigh\nthe mitigating factors is therefore necessary to impose the\ndeath penalty. It is clear, then, that this factual finding\nexposes the defendant to a greater punishment than he\nwould otherwise receive: death, as opposed to life without\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Under Apprendi and Ring, a finding that has such\nan effect must be made by a jury.\n   The facts of this case underscore why Alabama\u2019s statute\nmight run afoul of Apprendi and Ring. After the State\nand Woodward presented evidence at the sentencing\nhearing, the jury found two aggravating factors, but it\ndetermined that the mitigating factors outweighed those\naggravating factors, and it voted to recommend a sentence\nof life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The\njudge then heard additional evidence before reweighing\nthe aggravating and mitigating factors to reach the oppo-\nsite conclusion from the jury. With respect to the first\nmitigating circumstance\u2014Woodward\u2019s relationship with\nhis children\u2014the judge noted that he was \u201cunder-\nwhelmed\u201d by Woodward\u2019s family situation in light of the\nadditional evidence that only he had heard. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 80 (amended sentencing order). Rejecting the\nconclusion that Woodward had a positive influence on the\nlives of his young children, the judge opined: \u201cWhat young\nchild does not adore a parent?\u201d Ibid. The judge further\nreasoned that Woodward\u2019s criminal history rendered him\na \u201cvery poor parenting role model.\u201d Id., at 81. Moving to\nthe second mitigating factor\u2014Woodward\u2019s traumatic\nchildhood\u2014the judge concluded that the evidence of prob-\nlems in Woodward\u2019s childhood did not \u201cwithstand close\nscrutiny.\u201d Ibid. He noted that \u201cno documentation of abuse\nwas introduced\u201d; speculated that Woodward\u2019s \u201ctruncated\nacademic career may well have been the result of his\nbringing weapons to school, not the result of family is-\nsues\u201d; suggested that Woodward\u2019s mother did not actually\nsend him to live with his abusive father because no mother\nwould \u201csen[d] her children to live alone, unprotected with\nan abusive man\u201d; and found that it \u201cstrain[ed] logic to\naccept the story that [Woodward\u2019s] father evicted him.\u201d\nIbid. The judge opined that \u201c[w]hile [Woodward\u2019s] child-\nhood was not the stuff of fairytales, his youth appear[ed]\n12                   WOODWARD v.

And he concluded that the aggravating\nfactors \u201cfar outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.\u201d Id., at\n82.9 In other words, the judge imposed the death penalty\non Woodward only because he disagreed with the jury\u2019s\nassessment of the facts.\n  Under our Apprendi jurisprudence, as it has evolved\nsince Harris was decided, a sentencing scheme that per-\nmits such a result is constitutionally suspect.\n                        *     *    *\n  Eighteen years have passed since we last considered\nAlabama\u2019s capital sentencing scheme, and much has\nchanged since then. Today, Alabama stands alone: No\nother State condemns prisoners to death despite the con-\nsidered judgment rendered by a cross-section of its citizens\nthat the defendant ought to live. And Apprendi and its\nprogeny have made clear the sanctity of the jury\u2019s role in\nour system of criminal justice. Given these developments,\nwe owe the validity of Alabama\u2019s system a fresh look. I\ntherefore respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 In discounting the jury\u2019s finding that the mitigating circumstances\noutweighed the aggravating circumstances, the judge noted that he had\naccess to information that the jury did not hear (referring to the addi-\ntional factfinding he had conducted after the jury made its findings),\nand \u201csurmise[d]\u201d that some members of the jury were \u201cdaunted by\nthe task [of sentencing]\u201d and fell prey to defense counsel\u2019s \u201cpower-\nful, emotional appeal.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 82 (amended sentencing\norder).\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The judge was\nstatutorily entitled to do this under Alabama law, which\nprovides that a jury\u2019s decision as to whether a defendant\nshould be executed is merely an \u201cadvisory verdict\u201d that the\ntrial judge may override if she disagrees with the jury\u2019s\nconclusion. In the last decade, Alabama has been the only\nState in which judges have imposed the death penalty in\nthe face of contrary jury verdicts. Since Alabama adopted\nits current statute, its judges have imposed death sen-\ntences on 95 defendants contrary to a jury\u2019s verdict.1 Forty-\nthree of these defendants remain on death row today.\nBecause I harbor deep concerns about whether this prac-\ntice offends the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, I would\ngrant Woodward\u2019s petition for certiorari so that the Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 A list of these 95 defendants sentenced to death after a jury verdict\n\nof life imprisonment is produced in an appendix to this opinion. By\ncontrast, where juries have voted to impose the death penalty, Alabama\njudges have overridden that verdict in favor of a life sentence only nine\ntimes.\n2                 WOODWARD v.

See Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a746\u201318\u2013301,\n46\u201318\u2013305 (2013). In 27 of those 31 States, plus the fed-\neral system, 18 U. S. C. \u00a73593, the jury\u2019s decision to im-\npose life imprisonment is final and may not be disturbed\nby the trial judge under any circumstance. That leaves\nfour States in which the jury has a role in sentencing but\nis not the final decisionmaker. In Nebraska, the jury is\nresponsible for finding aggravating circumstances, while a\nthree-judge panel determines mitigating circumstances\nand weighs them against the aggravating circumstances\nto make the ultimate sentencing decision. See Neb. Rev.\nStat. \u00a7\u00a729\u20132520, 29\u20132521 (2008).

In the 1990\u2019s,\nthere were 74: 26 in Florida, 44 in Alabama, and 4 in\nIndiana.3 Since 2000, by contrast, there have been only 27\nlife-to-death overrides, 26 of which were by Alabama\njudges.4\n\n\n\n\n  As these statistics demonstrate, Alabama has become a\nclear outlier.

One of the four States,\nIndiana, no longer permits life-to-death judicial overrides\nat all. See Ind. Code \u00a735\u201350\u20132\u20139(e) (2004). Only one\ndefendant in Delaware has ever been condemned to death\nby a judicial life-to-death override, and the Delaware\nSupreme Court overturned his sentence.5 And no Florida\njudge has overridden a jury\u2019s verdict of a life sentence\nsince 1999.6 In sum, whereas judges across three States\noverrode roughly 10 jury verdicts per year in the 1980\u2019s\nand 1990\u2019s, a dramatic shift has taken place over the past\ndecade: Judges now override jury verdicts of life in just a\nsingle State, and they do so roughly twice a year.\n   What could explain Alabama judges\u2019 distinctive procliv-\nity for imposing death sentences in cases where a jury has\nalready rejected that penalty? There is no evidence that\ncriminal activity is more heinous in Alabama than in other\nStates, or that Alabama juries are particularly lenient in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 One Delaware judge has used the override to impose a death sen-\n\ntence in two cases involving the same defendant. On appeal, the\nDelaware Supreme Court twice vacated the death sentence, and ulti-\nmately ordered the trial court to impose a life sentence. See Garden v.\nState, 815 A. 2d 327, 331\u2013333 (2003); Garden v. State, 844 A. 2d 311,\n318 (2004).\n   6 Even after this Court upheld Florida\u2019s capital sentencing scheme in\n\nSpaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447 (1984), the practice of judicial\noverrides consistently declined in that State. Since 1972, 166 death\nsentences have been imposed in Florida following a jury recommenda-\ntion of life imprisonment. Between 1973 and 1989, an average of eight\npeople was sentenced to death on an override each year. That average\nnumber dropped by 50 percent between 1990 and 1994, and by an\nadditional 70 percent from 1995 to 1999. The practice then stopped\ncompletely. It has been more than 14 years since the last life-to-death\noverride in Florida; the last person sentenced to death after a jury\nrecommendation of life imprisonment was Jeffrey Weaver, sentenced in\nAugust 1999.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

The\nonly answer that is supported by empirical evidence is one\nthat, in my view, casts a cloud of illegitimacy over the\ncriminal justice system: Alabama judges, who are elected\nin partisan proceedings, appear to have succumbed to\nelectoral pressures. See Symposium, Politics and the\nDeath Penalty: Can Rational Discourse and Due Process\nSurvive the Perceived Political Pressure? 21 Fordham\nUrban L.

For example, Alabama\njudges frequently override jury life-without-parole verdicts\neven in cases where the jury was unanimous in that ver-\ndict.7 In many cases, judges have done so without offering\na meaningful explanation for the decision to disregard the\njury\u2019s verdict. In sentencing a defendant with an IQ of 65,\nfor example, one judge concluded that \u201c \u2018[t]he sociological\nliterature suggests Gypsies intentionally test low on\nstandard IQ tests.\u2019 \u201d 8 Override Report 20 (quoting Sen-\ntencing Order in State v.

Another judge, who was facing\nreelection at the time he sentenced a 19-year-old defend-\nant, refused to consider certain mitigating circumstances\nfound by the jury, which had voted to recommend a life-\nwithout-parole sentence.

Lockhart, a former\narmy soldier and Iraq war veteran, was convicted of murdering a\ncollege student, Lauren Burk. The jury recommended life imprison-\nment without the possibility of parole, influenced by mitigating circum-\nstances relating to severe psychological problems Lockhart suffered as\na result of his combat in Iraq.

Since our decisions in Spazi-\nano and Harris, our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence has\ndeveloped significantly. Five years after we decided Har-\nris, we held in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.

ALABAMA\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Two years later, we applied the Apprendi rule in Ring v.\nArizona to invalidate Arizona\u2019s capital sentencing scheme,\nwhich permitted the trial judge to determine the presence\nof aggravating factors required for imposition of the death\npenalty. 536 U.

We made clear that \u201c[c]apital\ndefendants, no less than noncapital defendants, . . . are\nentitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the\nlegislature conditions an increase in their maximum pun-\nishment.\u201d Id., at 589. And we overruled our earlier deci-\nsion in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), by holding\nthat the jury\u2014not the judge\u2014must find an aggravating\ncircumstance that is necessary for the imposition of the\ndeath penalty. Ring, 536 U.

(quoting Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n494, n. 19).\n   The very principles that animated our decisions in\nApprendi and Ring call into doubt the validity of Ala-\nbama\u2019s capital sentencing scheme. Alabama permits a\ndefendant to present mitigating circumstances that weigh\nagainst imposition of the death penalty. See Ala. Code\n\u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u201351, 13A\u20135\u201352. Indeed, we have long held that a\ndefendant has a constitutional right to present mitigating\nevidence in capital cases. See Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\nU. S. 104, 110 (1982). And a defendant is eligible for the\ndeath penalty in Alabama only upon a specific factual\nfinding that any aggravating factors outweigh the mitigat-\ning factors he has presented. See Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a713A\u20135\u2013\n46(e), 13A\u20135\u201347(e). The statutorily required finding that\nthe aggravating factors of a defendant\u2019s crime outweigh\nthe mitigating factors is therefore necessary to impose the\ndeath penalty. It is clear, then, that this factual finding\nexposes the defendant to a greater punishment than he\nwould otherwise receive: death, as opposed to life without\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Under Apprendi and Ring, a finding that has such\nan effect must be made by a jury.\n   The facts of this case underscore why Alabama\u2019s statute\nmight run afoul of Apprendi and Ring. After the State\nand Woodward presented evidence at the sentencing\nhearing, the jury found two aggravating factors, but it\ndetermined that the mitigating factors outweighed those\naggravating factors, and it voted to recommend a sentence\nof life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The\njudge then heard additional evidence before reweighing\nthe aggravating and mitigating factors to reach the oppo-\nsite conclusion from the jury. With respect to the first\nmitigating circumstance\u2014Woodward\u2019s relationship with\nhis children\u2014the judge noted that he was \u201cunder-\nwhelmed\u201d by Woodward\u2019s family situation in light of the\nadditional evidence that only he had heard. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 80 (amended sentencing order). Rejecting the\nconclusion that Woodward had a positive influence on the\nlives of his young children, the judge opined: \u201cWhat young\nchild does not adore a parent?\u201d Ibid. The judge further\nreasoned that Woodward\u2019s criminal history rendered him\na \u201cvery poor parenting role model.\u201d Id., at 81. Moving to\nthe second mitigating factor\u2014Woodward\u2019s traumatic\nchildhood\u2014the judge concluded that the evidence of prob-\nlems in Woodward\u2019s childhood did not \u201cwithstand close\nscrutiny.\u201d Ibid. He noted that \u201cno documentation of abuse\nwas introduced\u201d; speculated that Woodward\u2019s \u201ctruncated\nacademic career may well have been the result of his\nbringing weapons to school, not the result of family is-\nsues\u201d; suggested that Woodward\u2019s mother did not actually\nsend him to live with his abusive father because no mother\nwould \u201csen[d] her children to live alone, unprotected with\nan abusive man\u201d; and found that it \u201cstrain[ed] logic to\naccept the story that [Woodward\u2019s] father evicted him.\u201d\nIbid.

Today, Alabama stands alone: No\nother State condemns prisoners to death despite the con-\nsidered judgment rendered by a cross-section of its citizens\nthat the defendant ought to live. And Apprendi and its\nprogeny have made clear the sanctity of the jury\u2019s role in\nour system of criminal justice. Given these developments,\nwe owe the validity of Alabama\u2019s system a fresh look. I\ntherefore respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 In discounting the jury\u2019s finding that the mitigating circumstances\noutweighed the aggravating circumstances, the judge noted that he had\naccess to information that the jury did not hear (referring to the addi-\ntional factfinding he had conducted after the jury made its findings),\nand \u201csurmise[d]\u201d that some members of the jury were \u201cdaunted by\nthe task [of sentencing]\u201d and fell prey to defense counsel\u2019s \u201cpower-\nful, emotional appeal.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 82 (amended sentencing\norder).\n                     Cite as: 571 U.
