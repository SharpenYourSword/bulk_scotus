CARL BLESSING, ET AL.\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n   STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n            No. 13\u2013169   Decided November 18, 2013\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this petition.\n  Statement of JUSTICE ALITO, respecting the denial of the\npetition for writ of certiorari.\n  The petition in this case challenges a highly unusual\npractice followed by one District Court Judge in assessing\nthe adequacy of counsel in class actions. This judge insists\nthat class counsel \u201censure that the lawyers staffed on the\ncase fairly reflect the class composition in terms of rele\u00ad\nvant race and gender metrics.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.\nThe uniqueness of this practice weighs against review by\nthis Court, but the meaning of the Court\u2019s denial of the\npetition should not be misunderstood.\n                             I\n  In 2008, the Nation\u2019s only two providers of satellite\ndigital audio radio services, Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc.,\nand XM Satellite Holdings, Inc., merged to form a new\ncompany, Sirius XM Radio, Inc. (Sirius). Id., at 8a\u20139a.\nTheir subscribers claimed the merger violated antitrust\nlaws and filed several class actions that were joined in\na consolidated complaint and assigned to Judge Harold\nBaer, Jr., of the Southern District of New York. Judge\nBaer appointed three law firms to serve as interim class\ncounsel. Ibid.\n  In July 2010, class plaintiffs moved to certify a federal\nantitrust class. Ibid. Class certification is governed by\n2                   MARTIN v. BLESSING\n\n                     Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which sets out the\nrequirements that a putative class must meet to gain cer\u00ad\ntification. One such requirement is adequate class coun-\nsel; subsection (g) orders the district court to consider\nfour particular indicators of adequacy. It provides also\nthat the district court \u201cmay consider any other matter\npertinent to counsel\u2019s ability to fairly and adequately\nrepresent the interests of the class.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 23(g)(1)(B).\n   Citing that provision, Judge Baer ordered that the three\nlaw firms appointed as interim counsel (and subsequently\nelevated to permanent counsel) \u201censure that the lawyers\nstaffed on the case fairly reflect the class composition in\nterms of relevant race and gender metrics.\u201d App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 35a.\n   Class certification orders that impose race- and sex\u00ad\nbased staffing requirements on law firms appear to be part\nof Judge Baer\u2019s standard practice. In 2007, Judge Baer\nfollowed this practice in considering certification of a class\nof plaintiffs seeking redress under the Employee Retire\u00ad\nment Income Security Act. See In re J. P. Morgan Chase\nCash Balance Litigation, 242 F. R. D. 265, 277 (SDNY\n2007).\n   Three years later, in Spagnola v. Chubb Corp., 264\nF. R. D. 76 (SDNY 2010), Judge Baer refused to certify a\nputative class of insurance policyholders in part because\nof the race and gender of the proposed class counsel. He\nnoted that \u201cproposed . . . counsel . . . ha[d] provided no\ninformation\u2014firm resum\u00e9, attorney biographies, or other\u00ad\nwise\u2014[regarding the race or gender of the lawyers assigned\nto the case].\u201d Id., at 95, n. 23.\n   Judge Baer has repeated this practice in at least three\nadditional class actions apart from the one before the\nCourt today. See Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of\nMiss. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 280 F. R. D. 130, 142,\nn. 6 (SDNY 2012); New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Secu-\nrities Litigation, No. 08 Civ. 5048 (SDNY, Sept. 20, 2010).\n   Following certification in the present case, Sirius and\nclass counsel reached a settlement that drew objections.\nUnder the deal, Sirius would freeze its prices for five\nmonths and pay class counsel $13 million in attorney\u2019s\nfees. Blessing v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., 507 Fed. Appx. 1,\n3, 4 (CA2 2012). Sirius would pay no cash to class mem\u00ad\nbers. Ibid. Nicolas Martin, a class member and petitioner\nhere, objected, not only to those terms, but also to Judge\nBaer\u2019s reliance on race and gender in assessing the ade\u00ad\nquacy of class counsel. Petitioner asked the Second Cir\u00ad\ncuit to set aside the settlement as the tainted product of\nan invalid certification order. The Second Circuit rejected\nhis challenge to the certification order on standing\ngrounds, concluding that Martin failed to allege injury in\nfact. Martin now asks this Court to intervene.\n                             II\n   Based on the materials now before us, I am hard\u00ad\npressed to see any ground on which Judge Baer\u2019s practice\ncan be defended. This Court has often stressed that\n\u201c[r]acial discrimination has no place in the courtroom,\nwhether the proceeding is civil or criminal.\u201d Edmonson v.\nLeesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 630 (1991). Court\u00ad\napproved discrimination based on gender is similarly\nobjectionable, and therefore it is doubtful that the practice\nin question could survive a constitutional challenge.\n   Before reaching this constitutional question, however, a\ncourt would have to consider whether the challenged\npractice can be reconciled with Rule 23(g), which carefully\nregulates the appointment of class counsel. The appoint\u00ad\nment of class counsel is a sensitive matter. Because of the\nfees that class counsel may receive\u2014witness the present\ncase in which counsel was awarded $13 million for han\u00ad\n4                    MARTIN v. BLESSING\n\n                      Statement of ALITO, J.\n\ndling a case in which the class members received no com\u00ad\npensation\u2014any deviation from the criteria set out in the\nRule may give rise to suspicions about favoritism. There\nare more than 600 district judges, and it would be intoler\u00ad\nable if each judge adopted a personalized version of the\ncriteria set out in Rule 23(g).\n   It is true that Rule 23 allows a district court to con\u00ad\nsider \u201cany . . . matter pertinent to counsel\u2019s ability to fairly\nand adequately represent the interests of the class,\u201d\nRule 23(g)(1)(B), but I doubt that this provision can be\nstretched to justify the practice at issue here. It seems\nquite farfetched to argue that class counsel cannot fairly\nand adequately represent a class unless the race and\ngender of counsel mirror the demographics of the class.\nIndeed, if the District Court\u2019s rule were taken seriously, it\nwould seriously complicate the appointment process and\nlead to truly bizarre results.\n   It may be no easy matter to ascertain \u201cthe class compo\u00ad\nsition in terms of relevant race and gender metrics.\u201d In\nsome cases, only the defendant will possess such infor\u00ad\nmation, and where that is so, must the parties engage in\ndiscovery on this preliminary point? In other cases, it may\nbe impossible to obtain the relevant information without\nrequesting it from all of the members of the class. For\nexample, in a securities case in which the class consists of\neveryone who purchased the stock of a particular company\nduring a specified period, how else could the race or gen\u00ad\nder of the class members be ascertained?\n   Where the demographics of the class can be ascertained\nor approximated, faithful application of the District Court\u2019s\nrule would lead to strange results. The racial and eth-\nnic makeup of the plaintiff class in many cases deviates\nsignificantly from the racial and ethnic makeup of the\ngeneral population or of the bar. Suppose, for example,\nthat the class consisted of persons who had undergone a\nparticular type of treatment for prostate cancer. Would it\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nbe proper for a district judge to favor law firms with a high\npercentage of male attorneys? Or if the class consisted of\npersons who had undergone treatment for breast cancer,\nwould it be permissible for a court to favor firms with a\nhigh percentage of female lawyers? In some cases, the\nmembers of a class may be significantly more affluent\nthan the general population. (A class consisting of the\npurchasers of stock may be an example.) To the extent\nthat affluence correlates with race, would it be proper for a\ndistrict judge in such a case to favor law firms with rela\u00ad\ntively low minority representation?\n   The Second Circuit did not decide whether the District\nCourt\u2019s practice is unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful\nbecause the court held that Martin lacked standing to\nchallenge the order at issue. Martin did not allege that he\nactually received inferior representation, and therefore the\nSecond Circuit, invoking the standard used to determine\nwhether a plaintiff has standing under Article III of the\nConstitution, refused to entertain Martin\u2019s objection on\nthe ground that he had suffered no injury in fact. I find\nthis reasoning debatable.\n   It is not clear that a class member who objects to a\nfeature of a proposed settlement must show that the fea\u00ad\nture in question would cause the objecting member the\nsort of harm that is needed to establish Article III stand\u00ad\ning. Article III demands that the members of the plaintiff\nclass demonstrate that they were injured in fact by the\nalleged antitrust violations, see Amchem Products, Inc. v.\nWindsor, 521 U. S. 591, 613 (1997), but the plaintiff class\u2019\nsatisfaction of this requirement is not challenged. At\nissue, instead, is Martin\u2019s ability to object to the proposed\nsettlement, and Rule 23(e)(5) states without qualification\nthat \u201c[a]ny class member may object\u201d to a proposed set\u00ad\ntlement requiring court approval. I assume for present\npurposes that a court need not entertain the objection of a\nclass member who is not aggrieved by a settlement, but it\n6                   MARTIN v. BLESSING\n\n                     Statement of ALITO, J.\n\nis by no means clear to me that this is the same as requir\u00ad\ning proof of an injury in fact within the meaning of Article\nIII. See Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U. S. 1, 6\u20137 (2002) (an\nobjecting class member \u201chas an interest in the settlement\nthat creates a \u2018case or controversy\u2019 sufficient to satisfy\nthe constitutional requirements of injury, causation, and\nredressability\u201d).\n   Whether or not Martin suffered injury in fact in the\nArticle III sense, he unquestionably has a legitimate in-\nterest in ensuring that class counsel is appointed in a\nlawful manner. Ibid. The use of any criteria not set out\nspecifically in Rule 23(g) or \u201cpertinent to counsel\u2019s ability\nto fairly and adequately represent the interests of the\nclass\u201d creates a risk of injury that a class member should\nnot have to endure. And class members have a strong and\nlegitimate interest in having their attorneys appointed\npursuant to a practice that is free of unlawful discrimina\u00ad\ntion. If a district judge had a practice of appointing only\nattorneys of a particular race or gender, would an appel\u00ad\nlate court refuse to entertain a class member\u2019s objection\nunless the class member could show that the attorney in\nquestion did a poor job?\n   Unlike the courts of appeals, we are not a court of error\ncorrection, and thus I do not disagree with the Court\u2019s\nrefusal to review the singular policy at issue here. I\nstress, however, that the \u201cdenial of certiorari does not\nconstitute an expression of any opinion on the merits.\u201d\nBoumediene v. Bush, 549 U. S. 1328, 1329 (2007) (Stevens\nand KENNEDY, JJ., statement respecting denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). If the challenged appointment practice continues\nand is not addressed by the Court of Appeals, future re\u00ad\nview may be warranted.\n",

I\nstress, however, that the \u201cdenial of certiorari does not\nconstitute an expression of any opinion on the merits.\u201d\nBoumediene v. Bush, 549 U. S. 1328, 1329 (2007) (Stevens\nand KENNEDY, JJ., statement respecting denial of certio\u00ad\nrari). If the challenged appointment practice continues\nand is not addressed by the Court of Appeals, future re\u00ad\nview may be warranted.\n</pre>",
