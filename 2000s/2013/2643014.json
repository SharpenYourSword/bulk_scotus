Teamsters, 480 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1987) (O\u2019Connor,\nJ., in chambers) (quoting Coleman v. Paccar Inc., 424 U. S.\n1301, 1304 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). The\ndissent promises to show that the Fifth Circuit committed\nsuch error when it granted a stay in this case, see post, at\n3 (opinion of BREYER, J.), but that promise goes unful-\nfilled. Instead, the dissent mentions six \u201cconsiderations,\u201d\nmost of which bear no discernible relationship to the\n\u201caccepted standards\u201d we have hitherto told courts to apply.\nThe dissent\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with the \u201cgreat def-\nerence\u201d we owe to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, Garcia-\nMir v. Smith, 469 U. S. 1311, 1313 (1985) (Rehnquist,\nJ., in chambers)\u2014deference that \u201cis especially warranted\n2   PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER TEX. SURGICAL\n             HEALTH SERVICES v.

S. 1301, 1308 (2005) (GINSBURG, J., in chambers).\n   When deciding whether to issue a stay, the Fifth Circuit\nhad to consider four factors: (1) whether the State made a\nstrong showing that it was likely to succeed on the merits,\n(2) whether the State would have been irreparably injured\nabsent a stay, (3) whether issuance of a stay would sub-\nstantially injure other parties, and (4) where the public\ninterest lay. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434\n(2009). The first two factors are \u201cthe most critical.\u201d Ibid.\n   The Court of Appeals analyzed the first factor at length\nand concluded that the State was likely to prevail on the\nmerits of the constitutional question. The dissent does not\njoin issue with that conclusion; it says only that the ques-\ntion is \u201cdifficult.\u201d Post, at 4. Standing alone, that ob-\nservation cuts against vacatur, since the difficulty of a\nquestion is inversely proportional to the likelihood that a\ngiven answer will be clearly erroneous. With respect to the\nsecond factor, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the\nState faced irreparable harm because \u201c \u2018[a]ny time a State\nis enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted\nby representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irrepa-\nrable injury.\u2019 \u201d Maryland v. King, 567 U. S. __, __ (2012)\n(ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers) (slip op., at 2\u20133) (quoting\nNew Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434\nU. S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). The\ndissent does not quarrel with that conclusion either. It\nthus fails to allege any error, let alone obvious error, in the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 determination that the two \u201cmost criti-\ncal\u201d factors weighed in favor of the stay.\n   One might think that would be the end of the matter.\nYet the dissent asserts that \u201cthe balance of harms tilts in\nfavor of [the] applicants,\u201d post, at 4\u2014presumably referring\nto the third relevant factor, whether the stay would sub-\nstantially injure third parties. The Court of Appeals, of\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ncourse, acknowledged that applicants had \u201cmade a strong\nshowing that their interests would be harmed\u201d by a stay,\nbut it concluded that \u201cgiven the State\u2019s likely success on\nthe merits, this is not enough, standing alone, to outweigh\nthe other factors.\u201d ___ F. 3d ___, ___ 2013 WL 5857853,\n*9 (CA5, Oct. 31, 2013). The dissent never explains why\nthat conclusion was clearly wrong: In particular, it cites no\n\u201c \u2018accepted standar[d],\u2019 \u201d Western Airlines, supra, at 1305,\nrequiring a court to delay enforcement of a state law that\nthe court has determined is likely to withstand constitu-\ntional challenge solely because the law might injure third\nparties.\n    The Court of Appeals concluded that the fourth factor\nalso favored the stay, reasoning that the State\u2019s interest in\nenforcing a valid law merges with the public interest. See\nNken, supra, at 435. The dissent declines to criticize that\nreasoning, though we are presumably meant to infer from\nits disapproving comments about the stay\u2019s \u201cseriou[s]\ndisrupt[ion of the] status quo,\u201d post, at 3, that the dissent\nbelieves preservation of the status quo\u2014in which the law\nat issue is not enforced\u2014is in the public interest. Many\ncitizens of Texas, whose elected representatives voted for\nthe law, surely feel otherwise. But their views go un-\nacknowledged by the dissent, which again fails to cite\nany \u201c \u2018accepted standar[d]\u2019 \u201d requiring a court to delay\nenforcement of a state law that the court has determined\nis likely constitutional on the ground that the law threat-\nens disruption of the status quo.\n    In sum, the dissent would vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019\nstay without expressly rejecting that court\u2019s analysis of\nany of the governing factors. And it would flout core prin-\nciples of federalism by mandating postponement of a state\nlaw without asserting that the law is even probably un-\nconstitutional. Reasonable minds can perhaps disagree\nabout whether the Court of Appeals should have granted a\nstay in this case. But there is no doubt that the applicants\n4   PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF GREATER TEX.
