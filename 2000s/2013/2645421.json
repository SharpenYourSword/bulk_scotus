MARTIN\n\n               MULHALL ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                     [December 10, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and\nJUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n  Section 302(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n1947, 61 Stat. 157, as amended, an antibribery provision,\nmakes it a crime for an employer \u201cto pay, lend, or deliver,\nor agree to pay, lend, or deliver, any money or other\nthing of value\u201d to a labor union that represents or seeks to\nrepresent its employees. 29 U. S. C. \u00a7186(a)(2). Section\n302(b) makes it a crime \u201cfor any person to request [or]\ndemand . . . , or agree to receive or accept, any payment,\nloan, or delivery of any money or other thing of value\nprohibited by subsection (a).\u201d \u00a7186(b)(1). The question in\nthis case is whether an employer violates \u00a7302(a) by mak-\ning the following promises to a union that seeks to repre-\nsent its employees: (1) that the employer will remain\nneutral in respect to the union\u2019s efforts to organize its\nemployees, (2) that the union will be given access (for\norganizing purposes) to nonpublic areas of the employer\u2019s\npremises, and (3) that the union will receive a list of em-\nployees\u2019 names and contact information (also for organiz-\ning purposes). A further question (the other side of the\nsame coin) is whether a union violates \u00a7302(b) by request-\ning that the employer perform its contractual obligations\nto fulfill these promises.\n  The Eleventh Circuit held that these items are \u201cthing[s]\n2            UNITE HERE LOCAL 355 v. MULHALL\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nof value\u201d and that an employer\u2019s promise to \u201cpay\u201d them in\nreturn for something of value from the union violates the\nAct if the employer intends to use the payment to \u201ccor-\nrupt\u201d the union; the Eleventh Circuit also held that a\nunion\u2019s request that an employer make such a payment\nviolates \u00a7302(b) if the union intends to \u201cextort\u201d the benefit\nfrom the employer. 667 F. 3d 1211, 1215\u20131216 (2012).\nOther Circuits have held to the contrary, reasoning that\nsimilar promises by an employer to assist a union\u2019s orga-\nnizing campaign (or merely to avoid opposing the campaign)\nfall outside the scope of \u00a7302. See Adcock v. Freightliner\nLLC, 550 F. 3d 369 (CA4 2008); Hotel Employees & Res-\ntaurant Employees Union, Local 57 v. Sage Hospitality\nResources, LLC, 390 F. 3d 206 (CA3 2004). We granted\ncertiorari to resolve the conflict.\n   We have received briefs on the issue, and we have heard\noral argument. But in considering the briefs and argu-\nment, we became aware of two logically antecedent ques-\ntions that could prevent us from reaching the question of\nthe correct interpretation of \u00a7302. First, it is possible that\nthe case is moot because the contract between the employer\nand union that contained the allegedly criminal promises\nappears to have expired by the end of 2011, before the\nEleventh Circuit rendered its decision on the scope of\n\u00a7302. Second, it is arguable that respondent Mulhall, the\nsole plaintiff in this case, lacks Article III standing.\n   In my view, rather than dismiss the writ of certiorari as\nimprovidently granted, the Court should simply ask for\nadditional briefs addressing these two questions. If it\nturns out that the federal courts lack jurisdiction either\nbecause the case is moot or because Mulhall lacks stand-\ning, then we cannot reach the merits. But if that is the\ncase, then we should likely order the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ndecision vacated, thereby removing its precedential effect\nand leaving the merits question open to be resolved in a\nlater case that does fall within the jurisdiction of the\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfederal courts.\n   I believe we should also ask for further briefing on a\nthird question: the question whether \u00a7302 authorizes a\nprivate right of action. I recognize that the Court said,\nlong ago and in passing, that \u00a7302(e) \u201cpermit[s] private\nlitigants to obtain injunctions\u201d for violations of \u00a7302.\nSinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195, 205\n(1962), overruled in part on other grounds, Boys Markets,\nInc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235, 237\u2013238 (1970). But,\nin light of the Court\u2019s more restrictive views on private\nrights of action in recent decades, see, e.g., Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286\u2013287 (2001), the legal status\nof Sinclair Refining\u2019s dictum is uncertain. And if \u00a7302 in\nfact does not provide a right of action to private parties\nlike Mulhall, then courts will not need to reach difficult\nquestions about the scope of \u00a7302, as happened in this\ncase, unless the Federal Government decides to prosecute\nsuch cases rather than limit its attention to cases that\nclearly fall within the statute\u2019s core antibribery purpose.\n   Unless resolved, the differences among the Courts of\nAppeals could negatively affect the collective-bargaining\nprocess. This is because the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision\nraises the specter that an employer or union official could\nbe found guilty of a crime that carries a 5-year maximum\nsentence, see 29 U. S. C. \u00a7186(d), if the employer or union\nofficial is found to have made certain commonplace orga-\nnizing assistance agreements with the intent to \u201ccorrupt\u201d\nor \u201cextort.\u201d In my view, given the importance of the ques-\ntion presented to the collective-bargaining process, further\nbriefing, rather than dismissal, is the better course of\naction.\n",
