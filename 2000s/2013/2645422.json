JACOBS ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12\u2013815.      Argued November 5, 2013\u2014Decided December 10, 2013\nSprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), a national telecommunications\n  service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees im-\n  posed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a lo-\n  cal telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet\n  Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications\n  Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic. Wind-\n  stream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls,\n  which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin\n  Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. Windstream re-\n  tracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint. Con-\n  cerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceed-\n  ings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to\n  intrastate regulation. Rejecting Sprint\u2019s argument that this question\n  was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees ap-\n  plied to VoIP calls.\n     Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Fed-\n  eral District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunica-\n  tions Act of 1996 preempted the IUB\u2019s decision. As relief, Sprint\n  sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUB\u2019s order. Sprint\n  also sought review of the IUB\u2019s order in Iowa state court, reiterating\n  the preemption argument made in Sprint\u2019s federal-court complaint\n  and asserting several other claims. Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401\n  U. S. 37, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating\n  Sprint\u2019s complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.\n  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s abstention decision,\n  concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongo-\n  ing state-court review concerned Iowa\u2019s important interest in regulat-\n  ing and enforcing state utility rates.\n2           SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: This case does not fall within any of the three classes of excep-\n tional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) The District Court had jurisdiction to decide whether federal\n law preempted the IUB\u2019s decision, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\n Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642, and thus had a \u201cvirtually\n unflagging obligation\u201d to hear and decide the case, Colorado River\n Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817. In\n Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for\n cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.\n This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil\n proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v.\n Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, or that implicate a State\u2019s interest in en-\n forcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v.\n Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, but has reaffirmed that \u201conly exceptional cir-\n cumstances justify a federal court\u2019s refusal to decide a case in defer-\n ence to the States,\u201d New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of\n City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 368 (NOPSI). NOPSI identified\n three such \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d First, Younger precludes\n federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions. See 491\n U. S., at 368. Second, certain \u201ccivil enforcement proceedings\u201d war-\n rant Younger abstention. Ibid. Finally, federal courts should refrain\n from interfering with pending \u201ccivil proceedings involving certain or-\n ders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform\n their judicial functions.\u201d Ibid. This Court has not applied Younger\n outside these three \u201cexceptional\u201d categories, and rules, in accord with\n NOPSI, that they define Younger\u2019s scope. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSI\u2019s\n three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger\n abstention. The first and third categories plainly do not accommo-\n date the IUB\u2019s proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character,\n and which did not touch on a state court\u2019s ability to perform its judi-\n cial function. Nor is the IUB\u2019s order an act of civil enforcement of the\n kind to which Younger has been extended. The IUB proceeding is not\n \u201cakin to a criminal prosecution.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor\n was it initiated by \u201cthe State in its sovereign capacity,\u201d Trainor v.\n Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 444, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful\n act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar\n Assn., 457 U. S. 423, 433\u2013434. Rather, the action was initiated by\n Sprint, a private corporation. No state authority conducted an inves-\n tigation into Sprint\u2019s activities or lodged a formal complaint against\n Sprint.\n    Once Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administra-\n tive proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essen-\n tially, a civil enforcement action. However, the IUB\u2019s adjudicative\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private\n  parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.\n     In holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Cir-\n  cuit misinterpreted this Court\u2019s decision in Middlesex to mean that\n  Younger abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) \u201can ongoing\n  state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state inter-\n  ests, and (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal]\n  challenges.\u201d In Middlesex, the Court invoked Younger to bar a feder-\n  al court from entertaining a lawyer\u2019s challenge to a state ethics com-\n  mittee\u2019s pending investigation of the lawyer. Unlike the IUB\u2019s pro-\n  ceeding, however, the state ethics committee\u2019s hearing in Middlesex\n  was plainly \u201cakin to a criminal proceeding\u201d: An investigation and\n  formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\u2019s Su-\n  preme Court initiated the hearing, and the hearing\u2019s purpose was to\n  determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for failing to\n  meet the State\u2019s professional conduct standards. 457 U. S., at 433\u2013\n  435. The three Middlesex conditions invoked by the Court of Appeals\n  were therefore not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors\n  appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Young-\n  er. Younger extends to the three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d identi-\n  fied in NOPSI, but no further.

JACOBS ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [December 10, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case involves two proceedings, one pending in state\ncourt, the other in federal court. Each seeks review of an\nIowa Utilities Board (IUB or Board) order. And each\npresents the question whether Windstream Iowa Commu\u00ad\nnications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications\ncarrier, may impose on Sprint Communications, Inc.\n(Sprint), intrastate access charges for telephone calls\ntransported via the Internet. Federal-court jurisdiction\nover controversies of this kind was confirmed in Verizon\nMd. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635\n(2002). Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971),\nthe U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa\nabstained from adjudicating Sprint\u2019s complaint in defer\u00ad\nence to the parallel state-court proceeding, and the Court\nof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt\u2019s abstention decision.\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. In the\nmain, federal courts are obliged to decide cases within the\nscope of federal jurisdiction. Abstention is not in order\nsimply because a pending state-court proceeding involves\n2        SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe same subject matter. New Orleans Public Service, Inc.\nv. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 373\n(1989) (NOPSI) (\u201c[T]here is no doctrine that . . . pendency\nof state judicial proceedings excludes the federal courts.\u201d).\nThis Court has recognized, however, certain instances in\nwhich the prospect of undue interference with state pro\u00ad\nceedings counsels against federal relief. See id., at 368.\n  Younger exemplifies one class of cases in which federal\u00ad\ncourt abstention is required: When there is a parallel,\npending state criminal proceeding, federal courts must\nrefrain from enjoining the state prosecution. This Court\nhas extended Younger abstention to particular state civil\nproceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see\nHuffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592 (1975), or that\nimplicate a State\u2019s interest in enforcing the orders and\njudgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc.,\n481 U. S. 1 (1987). We have cautioned, however, that\nfederal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on\nthe merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional\ngrant, and should not \u201crefus[e] to decide a case in defer\u00ad\nence to the States.\u201d NOPSI, 491 U. S., at 368.\n  Circumstances fitting within the Younger doctrine, we\nhave stressed, are \u201cexceptional\u201d; they include, as cata\u00ad\nlogued in NOPSI, \u201cstate criminal prosecutions,\u201d \u201ccivil\nenforcement proceedings,\u201d and \u201ccivil proceedings involving\ncertain orders that are uniquely in furtherance of the state\ncourts\u2019 ability to perform their judicial functions.\u201d Id., at\n367\u2013368. Because this case presents none of the circum\u00ad\nstances the Court has ranked as \u201cexceptional,\u201d the general\nrule governs: \u201c[T]he pendency of an action in [a] state\ncourt is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter\nin the Federal court having jurisdiction.\u201d Colorado River\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800,\n817 (1976) (quoting McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268,\n282 (1910)).\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              I\n\n   Sprint, a national telecommunications service provider,\nhas long paid intercarrier access fees to the Iowa commu\u00ad\nnications company Windstream (formerly Iowa Telecom)\nfor certain long distance calls placed by Sprint customers\nto Windstream\u2019s in-state customers. In 2009, however,\nSprint decided to withhold payment for a subset of those\ncalls, classified as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),\nafter concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996\npreempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.1 In re\u00ad\nsponse, Windstream threatened to block all calls to and\nfrom Sprint customers.\n   Sprint filed a complaint against Windstream with the\nIUB asking the Board to enjoin Windstream from discon\u00ad\ntinuing service to Sprint. In Sprint\u2019s view, Iowa law enti\u00ad\ntled it to withhold payment while it contested the access\ncharges and prohibited Windstream from carrying out its\ndisconnection threat. In answer to Sprint\u2019s complaint,\nWindstream retracted its threat to discontinue serving\nSprint, and Sprint moved, successfully, to withdraw its\ncomplaint. Because the conflict between Sprint and Wind\u00ad\nstream over VoIP calls was \u201clikely to recur,\u201d however, the\nIUB decided to continue the proceedings to resolve the\nunderlying legal question, i.e., whether VoIP calls are\nsubject to intrastate regulation. Order in Sprint Commu\u00ad\nnications Co. v. Iowa Telecommunications Servs., Inc., No.\nFCU\u20132010\u20130001 (IUB, Feb. 1, 2010), p. 6 (IUB Order).\nThe question retained by the IUB, Sprint argued, was\ngoverned by federal law, and was not within the IUB\u2019s\nadjudicative jurisdiction. The IUB disagreed, ruling that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Federal Communications Commission has yet to provide its\n\nview on whether the Telecommunications Act categorically preempts\nintrastate access charges for VoIP calls. See In re Connect America\nFund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 18002, \u00b6934 (2011) (reserving the ques\u00ad\ntion whether all VoIP calls \u201cmust be subject exclusively to federal\nregulation\u201d).\n4          SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.2\n   Seeking to overturn the Board\u2019s ruling, Sprint com\u00ad\nmenced two lawsuits. First, Sprint sued the members of\nthe IUB (respondents here)3 in their official capacities in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof Iowa. In its federal-court complaint, Sprint sought\na declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996\npreempted the IUB\u2019s decision; as relief, Sprint requested\nan injunction against enforcement of the IUB\u2019s order.\nSecond, Sprint petitioned for review of the IUB\u2019s order\nin Iowa state court. The state petition reiterated the\npreemption argument Sprint made in its federal-court\ncomplaint; in addition, Sprint asserted state law and\nprocedural due process claims. Because Eighth Circuit\nprecedent effectively required a plaintiff to exhaust state\nremedies before proceeding to federal court, see Alleghany\nCorp. v. McCartney, 896 F. 2d 1138 (1990), Sprint urges\nthat it filed the state suit as a protective measure. Failing\nto do so, Sprint explains, risked losing the opportunity to\nobtain any review, federal or state, should the federal\ncourt decide to abstain after the expiration of the Iowa\nstatute of limitations. See Brief for Petitioner 7\u20138.4\n   As Sprint anticipated, the IUB filed a motion asking the\nFederal District Court to abstain in light of the state suit,\nciting Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971). The District\nCourt granted the IUB\u2019s motion and dismissed the suit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Atthe conclusion of the IUB proceedings, Sprint paid Windstream\nall contested fees.\n   3 For convenience, we refer to respondents collectively as the IUB.\n   4 Since we granted certiorari, the Iowa state court issued an opinion\n\nrejecting Sprint\u2019s preemption claim on the merits.

The Iowa court decision does\nnot, in the parties\u2019 view, moot this case, see Joint Supp. Brief 1, and we\nagree. Because Sprint intends to appeal the state-court decision, the\n\u201ccontroversy . . . remains live.\u201d Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 291, n. 7 (2005).\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe IUB\u2019s decision, and the pending state-court review of\nit, the District Court said, composed one \u201cuninterruptible\nprocess\u201d implicating important state interests. On that\nground, the court ruled, Younger abstention was in order.\nSprint Communications Co. v. Berntsen, No. 4:11\u2013cv\u2013\n00183\u2013JAJ (SD Iowa, Aug. 1, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n24a.\n    For the most part, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthe argument, accepted by several of its sister courts, that\nYounger abstention is appropriate only when the parallel\nstate proceedings are \u201ccoercive,\u201d rather than \u201cremedial,\u201d in\nnature. 690 F. 3d 864, 868 (2012); cf. Guillemard-Ginorio\nv. Contreras-G\u00f3mez, 585 F. 3d 508, 522 (CA1 2009)\n(\u201c[P]roceedings must be coercive, and in most cases, state\u00ad\ninitiated, in order to warrant abstention.\u201d). Instead, the\nEighth Circuit read this Court\u2019s precedent to require\nYounger abstention whenever \u201can ongoing state judicial\nproceeding . . . implicates important state interests, and\n. . . the state proceedings provide adequate opportunity to\nraise [federal] challenges.\u201d 690 F. 3d, at 867 (citing Mid\u00ad\ndlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn.,\n457 U. S. 423, 432 (1982)). Those criteria were satisfied\nhere, the appeals court held, because the ongoing state\u00ad\ncourt review of the IUB\u2019s decision concerned Iowa\u2019s \u201cim\u00ad\nportant state interest in regulating and enforcing its\nintrastate utility rates.\u201d 690 F. 3d, at 868. Recognizing\nthe \u201cpossibility that the parties [might] return to federal\ncourt,\u201d however, the Court of Appeals vacated the judg\u00ad\nment dismissing Sprint\u2019s complaint. In lieu of dismissal,\nthe Eighth Circuit remanded the case, instructing the\nDistrict Court to enter a stay during the pendency of the\nstate-court action. Id., at 869.\n    We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nour delineation of cases encompassed by the Younger\ndoctrine, abstention was appropriate here. 569 U. S. ___\n6          SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v.

In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\nServ. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635 (2002), we reviewed a\nsimilar federal-court challenge to a state administrative\nadjudication. In that case, as here, the party seeking\nfederal-court review of a state agency\u2019s decision urged that\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the state\naction. We had \u201cno doubt that federal courts ha[d federal\nquestion] jurisdiction under [28 U. S. C.] \u00a71331 to enter\u00ad\ntain such a suit,\u201d id., at 642, and nothing in the Telecom\u00ad\nmunications Act detracted from that conclusion, see id.,\nat 643.\n  Federal courts, it was early and famously said, have \u201cno\nmore right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is\ngiven, than to usurp that which is not given.\u201d Cohens v.\nVirginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).

United States, 424 U. S.\n800, 817 (1976). Parallel state-court proceedings do not\ndetract from that obligation.

Sun Oil\n\nCo., 319 U. S. 315 (1943), cannot independently sustain the Eighth\nCircuit\u2019s abstention analysis. See Brief for Respondents 9; cf. New\nOrleans Public Service, Inc. v.

In those circumstances, we\nsaid, the federal court should decline to enjoin the prose\u00ad\ncution, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid\nstate statute. See 401 U. S., at 53\u201354. Abstention was in\norder, we explained, under \u201cthe basic doctrine of equity\njurisprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . to\nrestrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party\nhas an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irrepa\u00ad\nrably injury if denied equitable relief.\u201d Id., at 43\u201344.\n\u201c[R]estraining equity jurisdiction within narrow limits,\u201d\nthe Court observed, would \u201cprevent erosion of the role of\nthe jury and avoid a duplication of legal proceedings and\nlegal sanctions.\u201d Id., at 44. We explained as well that this\ndoctrine was \u201creinforced\u201d by the notion of \u201c \u2018comity,\u2019 that is,\na proper respect for state functions.\u201d Ibid.\n  We have since applied Younger to bar federal relief in\ncertain civil actions. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S.\n592 (1975), is the pathmarking decision. There, Ohio\nofficials brought a civil action in state court to abate the\nshowing of obscene movies in Pursue\u2019s theater. Because\nthe State was a party and the proceeding was \u201cin aid of\nand closely related to [the State\u2019s] criminal statutes,\u201d the\nCourt held Younger abstention appropriate. Id., at 604.\n  More recently, in NOPSI, 491 U. S., at 368, the Court\nhad occasion to review and restate our Younger jurispru\u00ad\ndence. NOPSI addressed and rejected an argument that\na federal court should refuse to exercise jurisdiction to\nreview a state council\u2019s ratemaking decision. \u201c[O]nly ex\u00ad\nceptional circumstances,\u201d we reaffirmed, \u201cjustify a fed\u00ad\neral court\u2019s refusal to decide a case in deference to the\nStates.\u201d Ibid. Those \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist,\nthe Court determined after surveying prior decisions,\nin three types of proceedings. First, Younger precluded\n8        SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.\nSee ibid. Second, certain \u201ccivil enforcement proceedings\u201d\nwarranted abstention. Ibid. (citing, e.g., Huffman, 420\nU. S., at 604). Finally, federal courts refrained from inter\u00ad\nfering with pending \u201ccivil proceedings involving certain\norders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019\nability to perform their judicial functions.\u201d 491 U. S., at\n368 (citing Juidice v. Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 336, n. 12 (1977),\nand Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, 13 (1987)).\nWe have not applied Younger outside these three \u201cexcep\u00ad\ntional\u201d categories, and today hold, in accord with NOPSI,\nthat they define Younger\u2019s scope.\n                                B\n   The IUB does not assert that the Iowa state court\u2019s\nreview of the Board decision, considered alone, implicates\nYounger. Rather, the initial administrative proceeding\njustifies staying any action in federal court, the IUB con\u00ad\ntends, until the state review process has concluded. The\nsame argument was advanced in NOPSI. 491 U. S., at\n368. We will assume without deciding, as the Court did in\nNOPSI, that an administrative adjudication and the\nsubsequent state court\u2019s review of it count as a \u201cunitary\nprocess\u201d for Younger purposes. Id., at 369. The question\nremains, however, whether the initial IUB proceeding is of\nthe \u201csort . . . entitled to Younger treatment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The IUB proceeding, we conclude, does not fall within\nany of the three exceptional categories described in NOPSI\nand therefore does not trigger Younger abstention. The\nfirst and third categories plainly do not accommodate the\nIUB\u2019s proceeding. That proceeding was civil, not criminal\nin character, and it did not touch on a state court\u2019s ability\nto perform its judicial function. Cf. Juidice, 430 U. S., at\n336, n. 12 (civil contempt order); Pennzoil, 481 U. S., at 13\n(requirement for posting bond pending appeal).\n   Nor does the IUB\u2019s order rank as an act of civil enforce\u00ad\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of the kind to which Younger has been extended.\nOur decisions applying Younger to instances of civil en\u00ad\nforcement have generally concerned state proceedings\n\u201cakin to a criminal prosecution\u201d in \u201cimportant respects.\u201d\nHuffman, 420 U. S., at 604. See also Middlesex, 457 U. S.,\nat 432 (Younger abstention appropriate where \u201cnoncrimi\u00ad\nnal proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings\ncriminal in nature\u201d). Such enforcement actions are char\u00ad\nacteristically initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff, i.e.,\nthe party challenging the state action, for some wrongful\nact. See, e.g., Middlesex, 457 U. S., at 433\u2013434 (state\u00ad\ninitiated disciplinary proceedings against lawyer for viola\u00ad\ntion of state ethics rules). In cases of this genre, a state\nactor is routinely a party to the state proceeding and often\ninitiates the action. See, e.g., Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v.\nDayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619 (1986) (state\u00ad\ninitiated administrative proceedings to enforce state civil\nrights laws); Moore v.

S. 434, 444 (1977) (civil proceeding \u201cbrought by the\nState in its sovereign capacity\u201d to recover welfare pay\u00ad\nments defendants had allegedly obtained by fraud); Huff\u00ad\nman, 420 U. S., at 598 (state-initiated proceeding to\nenforce obscenity laws). Investigations are commonly\ninvolved, often culminating in the filing of a formal com\u00ad\nplaint or charges. See, e.g., Dayton, 477 U. S., at 624\n(noting preliminary investigation and complaint); Middle\u00ad\nsex, 457 U. S., at 433 (same).\n   The IUB proceeding does not resemble the state en\u00ad\nforcement actions this Court has found appropriate for\nYounger abstention. It is not \u201cakin to a criminal prosecu\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor was it initiated by\n\u201cthe State in its sovereign capacity.\u201d Trainor, 431 U. S., at\n444. A private corporation, Sprint, initiated the action.\nNo state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint\u2019s\n10         SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nactivities, and no state actor lodged a formal complaint\nagainst Sprint.\n   In its brief, the IUB emphasizes Sprint\u2019s decision to\nwithdraw the complaint that commenced proceedings\nbefore the Board. At that point, the IUB argues, Sprint\nwas no longer a willing participant, and the proceedings\nbecame, essentially, a civil enforcement action. See Brief\nfor Respondents 31.6 The IUB\u2019s adjudicative authority,\nhowever, was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two\nprivate parties, not to sanction Sprint for commission of a\nwrongful act. Although Sprint withdrew its complaint,\nadministrative efficiency, not misconduct by Sprint,\nprompted the IUB to answer the underlying federal ques\u00ad\ntion. By determining the intercarrier compensation re\u00ad\ngime applicable to VoIP calls, the IUB sought to avoid\nrenewed litigation of the parties\u2019 dispute. Because the\nunderlying legal question remained unsettled, the Board\nobserved, the controversy was \u201clikely to recur.\u201d IUB Order\n6. Nothing here suggests that the IUB proceeding was\n\u201cmore akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil\ncases.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604.\n   In holding that abstention was the proper course, the\nEighth Circuit relied heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in\nMiddlesex. Younger abstention was warranted, the Court\nof Appeals read Middlesex to say, whenever three condi\u00ad\ntions are met: There is (1) \u201can ongoing state judicial\nproceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests,\nand (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Todetermine whether a state proceeding is an enforcement action\nunder Younger, several Courts of Appeals, as noted, see supra, at 5,\ninquire whether the underlying state proceeding is \u201ccoercive\u201d rather\nthan \u201cremedial.\u201d See, e.g., Devlin v. Kalm, 594 F. 3d 893, 895 (CA6\n2010). Though we referenced this dichotomy once in a footnote, see\nOhio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S.\n619, 627, n. 2 (1986), we do not find the inquiry necessary or inevitably\nhelpful, given the susceptibility of the designations to manipulation.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Before this Court, the IUB has en\u00ad\ndorsed the Eighth Circuit\u2019s approach. Brief for Respond\u00ad\nents 13.\n   The Court of Appeals and the IUB attribute to this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Middlesex extraordinary breadth. We\ninvoked Younger in Middlesex to bar a federal court from\nentertaining a lawyer\u2019s challenge to a New Jersey state\nethics committee\u2019s pending investigation of the lawyer.\nUnlike the IUB proceeding here, the state ethics commit\u00ad\ntee\u2019s hearing in Middlesex was indeed \u201cakin to a criminal\nproceeding.\u201d As we noted, an investigation and formal\ncomplaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\u2019s\nSupreme Court initiated the hearing, and the purpose of\nthe hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should\nbe disciplined for his failure to meet the State\u2019s standards\nof professional conduct. 457 U. S., at 433\u2013435. See also\nid., at 438 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthe \u201cquasi-criminal nature of bar disciplinary proceed\u00ad\nings\u201d). The three Middlesex conditions recited above were\nnot dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors\nappropriately considered by the federal court before invok\u00ad\ning Younger.\n   Divorced from their quasi-criminal context, the three\nMiddlesex conditions would extend Younger to virtually all\nparallel state and federal proceedings, at least where a\nparty could identify a plausibly important state interest.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\u201336. That result is irreconcilable\nwith our dominant instruction that, even in the presence\nof parallel state proceedings, abstention from the exercise\nof federal jurisdiction is the \u201cexception, not the rule.\u201d\nHawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, 236\n(1984) (quoting Colorado River, 424 U. S., at 813). In\nshort, to guide other federal courts, we today clarify and\naffirm that Younger extends to the three \u201cexceptional\ncircumstances\u201d identified in NOPSI, but no further.\n12       SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v.

Argued November 5, 2013\u2014Decided December 10, 2013\nSprint Communications, Inc. (Sprint), a national telecommunications\n  service provider, withheld payment of intercarrier access fees im-\n  posed by Windstream Iowa Communications, Inc. (Windstream), a lo-\n  cal telecommunications carrier, for long distance Voice over Internet\n  Protocol (VoIP) calls, after concluding that the Telecommunications\n  Act of 1996 preempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic. Wind-\n  stream responded by threatening to block all Sprint customer calls,\n  which led Sprint to ask the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) to enjoin\n  Windstream from discontinuing service to Sprint. Windstream re-\n  tracted its threat, and Sprint moved to withdraw its complaint. Con-\n  cerned that the dispute would recur, the IUB continued the proceed-\n  ings in order to resolve the question whether VoIP calls are subject to\n  intrastate regulation. Rejecting Sprint\u2019s argument that this question\n  was governed by federal law, the IUB ruled that intrastate fees ap-\n  plied to VoIP calls.\n     Sprint sued respondents, IUB members (collectively IUB), in Fed-\n  eral District Court, seeking a declaration that the Telecommunica-\n  tions Act of 1996 preempted the IUB\u2019s decision. As relief, Sprint\n  sought an injunction against enforcement of the IUB\u2019s order. Sprint\n  also sought review of the IUB\u2019s order in Iowa state court, reiterating\n  the preemption argument made in Sprint\u2019s federal-court complaint\n  and asserting several other claims. Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401\n  U. S. 37, the Federal District Court abstained from adjudicating\n  Sprint\u2019s complaint in deference to the parallel state-court proceeding.\n  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s abstention decision,\n  concluding that Younger abstention was required because the ongo-\n  ing state-court review concerned Iowa\u2019s important interest in regulat-\n  ing and enforcing state utility rates.\n2           SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld: This case does not fall within any of the three classes of excep-\n tional cases for which Younger abstention is appropriate. Pp. 6\u201312.\n    (a) The District Court had jurisdiction to decide whether federal\n law preempted the IUB\u2019s decision, see Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\n Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635, 642, and thus had a \u201cvirtually\n unflagging obligation\u201d to hear and decide the case, Colorado River\n Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 817. In\n Younger, this Court recognized an exception to that obligation for\n cases in which there is a parallel, pending state criminal proceeding.\n This Court has extended Younger abstention to particular state civil\n proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see Huffman v.\n Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592, or that implicate a State\u2019s interest in en-\n forcing the orders and judgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v.\n Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, but has reaffirmed that \u201conly exceptional cir-\n cumstances justify a federal court\u2019s refusal to decide a case in defer-\n ence to the States,\u201d New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of\n City of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 368 (NOPSI). NOPSI identified\n three such \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d First, Younger precludes\n federal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions. See 491\n U. S., at 368. Second, certain \u201ccivil enforcement proceedings\u201d war-\n rant Younger abstention. Ibid. Finally, federal courts should refrain\n from interfering with pending \u201ccivil proceedings involving certain or-\n ders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform\n their judicial functions.\u201d Ibid. This Court has not applied Younger\n outside these three \u201cexceptional\u201d categories, and rules, in accord with\n NOPSI, that they define Younger\u2019s scope. Pp. 6\u20138.\n    (b) The initial IUB proceeding does not fall within any of NOPSI\u2019s\n three exceptional categories and therefore does not trigger Younger\n abstention. The first and third categories plainly do not accommo-\n date the IUB\u2019s proceeding, which was civil, not criminal in character,\n and which did not touch on a state court\u2019s ability to perform its judi-\n cial function. Nor is the IUB\u2019s order an act of civil enforcement of the\n kind to which Younger has been extended. The IUB proceeding is not\n \u201cakin to a criminal prosecution.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor\n was it initiated by \u201cthe State in its sovereign capacity,\u201d Trainor v.\n Hernandez, 431 U. S. 434, 444, to sanction Sprint for some wrongful\n act, see, e.g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar\n Assn., 457 U. S. 423, 433\u2013434. Rather, the action was initiated by\n Sprint, a private corporation. No state authority conducted an inves-\n tigation into Sprint\u2019s activities or lodged a formal complaint against\n Sprint.\n    Once Sprint withdrew the complaint that commenced administra-\n tive proceedings, the IUB argues, those proceedings became, essen-\n tially, a civil enforcement action. However, the IUB\u2019s adjudicative\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  authority was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two private\n  parties, not to sanction Sprint for a wrongful act.\n     In holding that abstention was the proper course, the Eighth Cir-\n  cuit misinterpreted this Court\u2019s decision in Middlesex to mean that\n  Younger abstention is warranted whenever there is (1) \u201can ongoing\n  state judicial proceeding, which (2) implicates important state inter-\n  ests, and (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise [federal]\n  challenges.\u201d In Middlesex, the Court invoked Younger to bar a feder-\n  al court from entertaining a lawyer\u2019s challenge to a state ethics com-\n  mittee\u2019s pending investigation of the lawyer. Unlike the IUB\u2019s pro-\n  ceeding, however, the state ethics committee\u2019s hearing in Middlesex\n  was plainly \u201cakin to a criminal proceeding\u201d: An investigation and\n  formal complaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\u2019s Su-\n  preme Court initiated the hearing, and the hearing\u2019s purpose was to\n  determine whether the lawyer should be disciplined for failing to\n  meet the State\u2019s professional conduct standards. 457 U. S., at 433\u2013\n  435. The three Middlesex conditions invoked by the Court of Appeals\n  were therefore not dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors\n  appropriately considered by the federal court before invoking Young-\n  er. Younger extends to the three \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d identi-\n  fied in NOPSI, but no further.

Each seeks review of an\nIowa Utilities Board (IUB or Board) order. And each\npresents the question whether Windstream Iowa Commu\u00ad\nnications, Inc. (Windstream), a local telecommunications\ncarrier, may impose on Sprint Communications, Inc.\n(Sprint), intrastate access charges for telephone calls\ntransported via the Internet. Federal-court jurisdiction\nover controversies of this kind was confirmed in Verizon\nMd. Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635\n(2002). Invoking Younger v. Harris, 401 U.

In the\nmain, federal courts are obliged to decide cases within the\nscope of federal jurisdiction.

S. 350, 373\n(1989) (NOPSI) (\u201c[T]here is no doctrine that . . . pendency\nof state judicial proceedings excludes the federal courts.\u201d).\nThis Court has recognized, however, certain instances in\nwhich the prospect of undue interference with state pro\u00ad\nceedings counsels against federal relief. See id., at 368.\n  Younger exemplifies one class of cases in which federal\u00ad\ncourt abstention is required: When there is a parallel,\npending state criminal proceeding, federal courts must\nrefrain from enjoining the state prosecution. This Court\nhas extended Younger abstention to particular state civil\nproceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions, see\nHuffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S. 592 (1975), or that\nimplicate a State\u2019s interest in enforcing the orders and\njudgments of its courts, see Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc.,\n481 U. S. 1 (1987). We have cautioned, however, that\nfederal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on\nthe merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional\ngrant, and should not \u201crefus[e] to decide a case in defer\u00ad\nence to the States.\u201d NOPSI, 491 U.

In 2009, however,\nSprint decided to withhold payment for a subset of those\ncalls, classified as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),\nafter concluding that the Telecommunications Act of 1996\npreempted intrastate regulation of VoIP traffic.1 In re\u00ad\nsponse, Windstream threatened to block all calls to and\nfrom Sprint customers.\n   Sprint filed a complaint against Windstream with the\nIUB asking the Board to enjoin Windstream from discon\u00ad\ntinuing service to Sprint. In Sprint\u2019s view, Iowa law enti\u00ad\ntled it to withhold payment while it contested the access\ncharges and prohibited Windstream from carrying out its\ndisconnection threat. In answer to Sprint\u2019s complaint,\nWindstream retracted its threat to discontinue serving\nSprint, and Sprint moved, successfully, to withdraw its\ncomplaint. Because the conflict between Sprint and Wind\u00ad\nstream over VoIP calls was \u201clikely to recur,\u201d however, the\nIUB decided to continue the proceedings to resolve the\nunderlying legal question, i.e., whether VoIP calls are\nsubject to intrastate regulation. Order in Sprint Commu\u00ad\nnications Co. v. Iowa Telecommunications Servs., Inc., No.\nFCU\u20132010\u20130001 (IUB, Feb. 1, 2010), p. 6 (IUB Order).\nThe question retained by the IUB, Sprint argued, was\ngoverned by federal law, and was not within the IUB\u2019s\nadjudicative jurisdiction. The IUB disagreed, ruling that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Federal Communications Commission has yet to provide its\n\nview on whether the Telecommunications Act categorically preempts\nintrastate access charges for VoIP calls. See In re Connect America\nFund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 18002, \u00b6934 (2011) (reserving the ques\u00ad\ntion whether all VoIP calls \u201cmust be subject exclusively to federal\nregulation\u201d).\n4          SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe intrastate fees applied to VoIP calls.2\n   Seeking to overturn the Board\u2019s ruling, Sprint com\u00ad\nmenced two lawsuits. First, Sprint sued the members of\nthe IUB (respondents here)3 in their official capacities in\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District\nof Iowa. In its federal-court complaint, Sprint sought\na declaration that the Telecommunications Act of 1996\npreempted the IUB\u2019s decision; as relief, Sprint requested\nan injunction against enforcement of the IUB\u2019s order.\nSecond, Sprint petitioned for review of the IUB\u2019s order\nin Iowa state court. The state petition reiterated the\npreemption argument Sprint made in its federal-court\ncomplaint; in addition, Sprint asserted state law and\nprocedural due process claims. Because Eighth Circuit\nprecedent effectively required a plaintiff to exhaust state\nremedies before proceeding to federal court, see Alleghany\nCorp. v. McCartney, 896 F. 2d 1138 (1990), Sprint urges\nthat it filed the state suit as a protective measure. Failing\nto do so, Sprint explains, risked losing the opportunity to\nobtain any review, federal or state, should the federal\ncourt decide to abstain after the expiration of the Iowa\nstatute of limitations. See Brief for Petitioner 7\u20138.4\n   As Sprint anticipated, the IUB filed a motion asking the\nFederal District Court to abstain in light of the state suit,\nciting Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971). The District\nCourt granted the IUB\u2019s motion and dismissed the suit.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Atthe conclusion of the IUB proceedings, Sprint paid Windstream\nall contested fees.\n   3 For convenience, we refer to respondents collectively as the IUB.\n   4 Since we granted certiorari, the Iowa state court issued an opinion\n\nrejecting Sprint\u2019s preemption claim on the merits.

The Iowa court decision does\nnot, in the parties\u2019 view, moot this case, see Joint Supp. Brief 1, and we\nagree. Because Sprint intends to appeal the state-court decision, the\n\u201ccontroversy . . . remains live.\u201d Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic\nIndustries Corp., 544 U.

On that\nground, the court ruled, Younger abstention was in order.\nSprint Communications Co. v. Berntsen, No. 4:11\u2013cv\u2013\n00183\u2013JAJ (SD Iowa, Aug. 1, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n24a.\n    For the most part, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the\nDistrict Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthe argument, accepted by several of its sister courts, that\nYounger abstention is appropriate only when the parallel\nstate proceedings are \u201ccoercive,\u201d rather than \u201cremedial,\u201d in\nnature. 690 F. 3d 864, 868 (2012); cf. Guillemard-Ginorio\nv. Contreras-G\u00f3mez, 585 F. 3d 508, 522 (CA1 2009)\n(\u201c[P]roceedings must be coercive, and in most cases, state\u00ad\ninitiated, in order to warrant abstention.\u201d). Instead, the\nEighth Circuit read this Court\u2019s precedent to require\nYounger abstention whenever \u201can ongoing state judicial\nproceeding . . . implicates important state interests, and\n. . . the state proceedings provide adequate opportunity to\nraise [federal] challenges.\u201d 690 F. 3d, at 867 (citing Mid\u00ad\ndlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Assn.,\n457 U. S. 423, 432 (1982)). Those criteria were satisfied\nhere, the appeals court held, because the ongoing state\u00ad\ncourt review of the IUB\u2019s decision concerned Iowa\u2019s \u201cim\u00ad\nportant state interest in regulating and enforcing its\nintrastate utility rates.\u201d 690 F. 3d, at 868. Recognizing\nthe \u201cpossibility that the parties [might] return to federal\ncourt,\u201d however, the Court of Appeals vacated the judg\u00ad\nment dismissing Sprint\u2019s complaint. In lieu of dismissal,\nthe Eighth Circuit remanded the case, instructing the\nDistrict Court to enter a stay during the pendency of the\nstate-court action. Id., at 869.\n    We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nour delineation of cases encompassed by the Younger\ndoctrine, abstention was appropriate here. 569 U.

In Verizon Md. Inc. v. Public\nServ. Comm\u2019n of Md., 535 U. S. 635 (2002), we reviewed a\nsimilar federal-court challenge to a state administrative\nadjudication. In that case, as here, the party seeking\nfederal-court review of a state agency\u2019s decision urged that\nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 preempted the state\naction. We had \u201cno doubt that federal courts ha[d federal\nquestion] jurisdiction under [28 U. S.

Sun Oil\n\nCo., 319 U. S. 315 (1943), cannot independently sustain the Eighth\nCircuit\u2019s abstention analysis. See Brief for Respondents 9; cf. New\nOrleans Public Service, Inc. v.

S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCriminal Syndicalism Act.        Requesting an injunction\nagainst the Act\u2019s enforcement, the federal-court plaintiff\nwas at the time the defendant in a pending state criminal\nprosecution under the Act. In those circumstances, we\nsaid, the federal court should decline to enjoin the prose\u00ad\ncution, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid\nstate statute. See 401 U. S., at 53\u201354. Abstention was in\norder, we explained, under \u201cthe basic doctrine of equity\njurisprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . to\nrestrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party\nhas an adequate remedy at law and will not suffer irrepa\u00ad\nrably injury if denied equitable relief.\u201d Id., at 43\u201344.\n\u201c[R]estraining equity jurisdiction within narrow limits,\u201d\nthe Court observed, would \u201cprevent erosion of the role of\nthe jury and avoid a duplication of legal proceedings and\nlegal sanctions.\u201d Id., at 44. We explained as well that this\ndoctrine was \u201creinforced\u201d by the notion of \u201c \u2018comity,\u2019 that is,\na proper respect for state functions.\u201d Ibid.\n  We have since applied Younger to bar federal relief in\ncertain civil actions. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U. S.\n592 (1975), is the pathmarking decision. There, Ohio\nofficials brought a civil action in state court to abate the\nshowing of obscene movies in Pursue\u2019s theater. Because\nthe State was a party and the proceeding was \u201cin aid of\nand closely related to [the State\u2019s] criminal statutes,\u201d the\nCourt held Younger abstention appropriate. Id., at 604.\n  More recently, in NOPSI, 491 U. S., at 368, the Court\nhad occasion to review and restate our Younger jurispru\u00ad\ndence. NOPSI addressed and rejected an argument that\na federal court should refuse to exercise jurisdiction to\nreview a state council\u2019s ratemaking decision. \u201c[O]nly ex\u00ad\nceptional circumstances,\u201d we reaffirmed, \u201cjustify a fed\u00ad\neral court\u2019s refusal to decide a case in deference to the\nStates.\u201d Ibid. Those \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist,\nthe Court determined after surveying prior decisions,\nin three types of proceedings. First, Younger precluded\n8        SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal intrusion into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.\nSee ibid. Second, certain \u201ccivil enforcement proceedings\u201d\nwarranted abstention. Ibid. (citing, e.g., Huffman, 420\nU. S., at 604). Finally, federal courts refrained from inter\u00ad\nfering with pending \u201ccivil proceedings involving certain\norders . . . uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019\nability to perform their judicial functions.\u201d 491 U. S., at\n368 (citing Juidice v. Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 336, n. 12 (1977),\nand Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1, 13 (1987)).\nWe have not applied Younger outside these three \u201cexcep\u00ad\ntional\u201d categories, and today hold, in accord with NOPSI,\nthat they define Younger\u2019s scope.\n                                B\n   The IUB does not assert that the Iowa state court\u2019s\nreview of the Board decision, considered alone, implicates\nYounger. Rather, the initial administrative proceeding\njustifies staying any action in federal court, the IUB con\u00ad\ntends, until the state review process has concluded. The\nsame argument was advanced in NOPSI. 491 U. S., at\n368. We will assume without deciding, as the Court did in\nNOPSI, that an administrative adjudication and the\nsubsequent state court\u2019s review of it count as a \u201cunitary\nprocess\u201d for Younger purposes. Id., at 369. The question\nremains, however, whether the initial IUB proceeding is of\nthe \u201csort . . . entitled to Younger treatment.\u201d Ibid.\n   The IUB proceeding, we conclude, does not fall within\nany of the three exceptional categories described in NOPSI\nand therefore does not trigger Younger abstention. The\nfirst and third categories plainly do not accommodate the\nIUB\u2019s proceeding. That proceeding was civil, not criminal\nin character, and it did not touch on a state court\u2019s ability\nto perform its judicial function. Cf. Juidice, 430 U. S., at\n336, n. 12 (civil contempt order); Pennzoil, 481 U. S., at 13\n(requirement for posting bond pending appeal).\n   Nor does the IUB\u2019s order rank as an act of civil enforce\u00ad\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nment of the kind to which Younger has been extended.\nOur decisions applying Younger to instances of civil en\u00ad\nforcement have generally concerned state proceedings\n\u201cakin to a criminal prosecution\u201d in \u201cimportant respects.\u201d\nHuffman, 420 U. S., at 604. See also Middlesex, 457 U. S.,\nat 432 (Younger abstention appropriate where \u201cnoncrimi\u00ad\nnal proceedings bear a close relationship to proceedings\ncriminal in nature\u201d). Such enforcement actions are char\u00ad\nacteristically initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff, i.e.,\nthe party challenging the state action, for some wrongful\nact. See, e.g., Middlesex, 457 U. S., at 433\u2013434 (state\u00ad\ninitiated disciplinary proceedings against lawyer for viola\u00ad\ntion of state ethics rules). In cases of this genre, a state\nactor is routinely a party to the state proceeding and often\ninitiates the action. See, e.g., Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v.\nDayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S. 619 (1986) (state\u00ad\ninitiated administrative proceedings to enforce state civil\nrights laws); Moore v.

S., at 598 (state-initiated proceeding to\nenforce obscenity laws). Investigations are commonly\ninvolved, often culminating in the filing of a formal com\u00ad\nplaint or charges. See, e.g., Dayton, 477 U. S., at 624\n(noting preliminary investigation and complaint); Middle\u00ad\nsex, 457 U. S., at 433 (same).\n   The IUB proceeding does not resemble the state en\u00ad\nforcement actions this Court has found appropriate for\nYounger abstention. It is not \u201cakin to a criminal prosecu\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604. Nor was it initiated by\n\u201cthe State in its sovereign capacity.\u201d Trainor, 431 U. S., at\n444. A private corporation, Sprint, initiated the action.\nNo state authority conducted an investigation into Sprint\u2019s\n10         SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v. JACOBS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nactivities, and no state actor lodged a formal complaint\nagainst Sprint.\n   In its brief, the IUB emphasizes Sprint\u2019s decision to\nwithdraw the complaint that commenced proceedings\nbefore the Board. At that point, the IUB argues, Sprint\nwas no longer a willing participant, and the proceedings\nbecame, essentially, a civil enforcement action. See Brief\nfor Respondents 31.6 The IUB\u2019s adjudicative authority,\nhowever, was invoked to settle a civil dispute between two\nprivate parties, not to sanction Sprint for commission of a\nwrongful act. Although Sprint withdrew its complaint,\nadministrative efficiency, not misconduct by Sprint,\nprompted the IUB to answer the underlying federal ques\u00ad\ntion. By determining the intercarrier compensation re\u00ad\ngime applicable to VoIP calls, the IUB sought to avoid\nrenewed litigation of the parties\u2019 dispute. Because the\nunderlying legal question remained unsettled, the Board\nobserved, the controversy was \u201clikely to recur.\u201d IUB Order\n6. Nothing here suggests that the IUB proceeding was\n\u201cmore akin to a criminal prosecution than are most civil\ncases.\u201d Huffman, 420 U. S., at 604.\n   In holding that abstention was the proper course, the\nEighth Circuit relied heavily on this Court\u2019s decision in\nMiddlesex. Younger abstention was warranted, the Court\nof Appeals read Middlesex to say, whenever three condi\u00ad\ntions are met: There is (1) \u201can ongoing state judicial\nproceeding, which (2) implicates important state interests,\nand (3) . . . provide[s] an adequate opportunity to raise\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Todetermine whether a state proceeding is an enforcement action\nunder Younger, several Courts of Appeals, as noted, see supra, at 5,\ninquire whether the underlying state proceeding is \u201ccoercive\u201d rather\nthan \u201cremedial.\u201d See, e.g., Devlin v. Kalm, 594 F. 3d 893, 895 (CA6\n2010). Though we referenced this dichotomy once in a footnote, see\nOhio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S.\n619, 627, n. 2 (1986), we do not find the inquiry necessary or inevitably\nhelpful, given the susceptibility of the designations to manipulation.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Before this Court, the IUB has en\u00ad\ndorsed the Eighth Circuit\u2019s approach. Brief for Respond\u00ad\nents 13.\n   The Court of Appeals and the IUB attribute to this\nCourt\u2019s decision in Middlesex extraordinary breadth. We\ninvoked Younger in Middlesex to bar a federal court from\nentertaining a lawyer\u2019s challenge to a New Jersey state\nethics committee\u2019s pending investigation of the lawyer.\nUnlike the IUB proceeding here, the state ethics commit\u00ad\ntee\u2019s hearing in Middlesex was indeed \u201cakin to a criminal\nproceeding.\u201d As we noted, an investigation and formal\ncomplaint preceded the hearing, an agency of the State\u2019s\nSupreme Court initiated the hearing, and the purpose of\nthe hearing was to determine whether the lawyer should\nbe disciplined for his failure to meet the State\u2019s standards\nof professional conduct. 457 U. S., at 433\u2013435. See also\nid., at 438 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (noting\nthe \u201cquasi-criminal nature of bar disciplinary proceed\u00ad\nings\u201d). The three Middlesex conditions recited above were\nnot dispositive; they were, instead, additional factors\nappropriately considered by the federal court before invok\u00ad\ning Younger.\n   Divorced from their quasi-criminal context, the three\nMiddlesex conditions would extend Younger to virtually all\nparallel state and federal proceedings, at least where a\nparty could identify a plausibly important state interest.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\u201336. That result is irreconcilable\nwith our dominant instruction that, even in the presence\nof parallel state proceedings, abstention from the exercise\nof federal jurisdiction is the \u201cexception, not the rule.\u201d\nHawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U. S. 229, 236\n(1984) (quoting Colorado River, 424 U. S., at 813). In\nshort, to guide other federal courts, we today clarify and\naffirm that Younger extends to the three \u201cexceptional\ncircumstances\u201d identified in NOPSI, but no further.\n12       SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS, INC. v.
