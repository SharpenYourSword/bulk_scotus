HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT\n\n              INSURANCE CO. ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 12\u2013729.      Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided December 16, 2013\nRespondent Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) is the\n  administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\u2019s (Wal-Mart) Group Long\n  Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the\n  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The\n  Plan\u2019s insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant\n  to the judicial review provision in ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after \u201cproof of loss\u201d is\n  due. Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability ben-\n  efits with Hartford. After petitioner exhausted the mandatory ad-\n  ministrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial. Almost\n  three years after that final denial but more than three years after\n  proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pur-\n  suant to ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dis-\n  miss on the ground that the claim was untimely. The District Court\n  granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a\n  statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was\n  enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent. The\n  Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Plan\u2019s limitations provision is enforceable. Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) The courts of appeals require participants in an employee bene-\n fit plan covered by ERISA to exhaust the plan\u2019s administrative reme-\n dies before filing suit to recover benefits. A plan participant\u2019s cause\n of action under ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until\n the plan issues a final denial. But it does not follow that a plan and\n its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period be-\n fore that time. Pp. 4\u20138.\n      (1) The rule set forth in Order of United Commercial Travelers of\n2      HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    America v. Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586, 608, provides that a contractual limi-\n    tations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of\n    reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary.\n    That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability\n    of the Plan\u2019s limitations provision. The Wolfe approach necessarily\n    allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and\n    to its commencement. Pp. 5\u20137.\n         (2) The principle that contractual limitations provisions should\n    ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the con-\n    text of an ERISA plan. Heimeshoff\u2019s cause of action is bound up with\n    the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to\n    bring suit \u201cto enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.\u201d\n    \u00a71132(a)(1)(B). This Court has thus recognized the particular im-\n    portance of enforcing plan terms as written in \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claims,\n    see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and will not pre-\n    sume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different ap-\n    proach here. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (b) Unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or there is a\n    \u201ccontrolling statute to the contrary,\u201d Wolfe, supra, at 608, the Plan\u2019s\n    limitations provision must be given effect. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (1) The Plan\u2019s period is not unreasonably short. Applicable regu-\n    lations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about\n    one year. Here, the Plan\u2019s administrative review process (\u201cinternal\n    review\u201d) required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with\n    approximately one year to file suit. Her reliance on Occidental Life\n    Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, in which this Court declined\n    to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII em-\n    ployment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Op-\n    portunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavail-\n    ing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to\n    bringing a timely ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claim. Pp. 9\u201310.\n         (2) This Court rejects the contentions of Heimeshoff and the\n    United States that the limitations provision is unenforceable because\n    it will undermine ERISA\u2019s two-tiered remedial scheme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n            (i) Enforcement of the Plan\u2019s limitation provision is unlikely to\n    cause participants to shortchange the internal review process. The\n    record for judicial review generally has been limited to the adminis-\n    trative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during in-\n    ternal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.\n    In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations\n    in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such deter-\n    minations only for abuse of discretion. Pp. 11\u201312.\n            (ii) It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that\n    begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will en-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  danger judicial review. To the extent that administrators attempt to\n  prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad\n  faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is im-\n  mediate access to judicial review for the participant. Evidence from\n  forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual pro-\n  vision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review\n  will not diminish the availability of judicial review either.\n  Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA\n  \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3-\n  year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls\n  on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights. More-\n  over, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as\n  waiver or estoppel, see, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., 136 U. S.\n  287, 298\u2013299, and equitable tolling, see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of\n  Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95, that nevertheless may allow partic-\n  ipants to proceed. Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolu-\n  tion beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations\n  must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time. 29 CFR\n  \u00a72560.503\u20131(c)(3)(ii). Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (3) Heimeshoff\u2019s additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during in-\n  ternal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the\n  limitations provision, which is enforceable. And federal courts need\n  not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during\n  internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not\n  borrowed from state law.

HARTFORD \n\n     LIFE & ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO. ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                              [December 16, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   A participant in an employee benefit plan covered by\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et\nseq., may bring a civil action under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) to re-\ncover benefits due under the terms of the plan. 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71132(a)(1)(B). Courts have generally required partici-\npants to exhaust the plan\u2019s administrative remedies before\nfiling suit to recover benefits. ERISA does not, however,\nspecify a statute of limitations for filing suit under\n\u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Filling that gap, the plan at issue here\nrequires participants to bring suit within three years after\n\u201cproof of loss\u201d is due. Because proof of loss is due before\na plan\u2019s administrative process can be completed, the ad-\nministrative exhaustion requirement will, in practice,\nshorten the contractual limitations period. The question\npresented is whether the contractual limitations provision\nis enforceable. We hold that it is.\n                             I\n  In 2005, petitioner Julie Heimeshoff began to report\nchronic pain and fatigue that interfered with her duties as\n2    HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\na senior public relations manager for Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. Her physician later diagnosed her with lupus and\nfibromyalgia. Heimeshoff stopped working on June 8.\n   On August 22, 2005, Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-\nterm disability benefits with Hartford Life & Accident\nInsurance Co., the administrator of Wal-Mart\u2019s Group\nLong Term Disability Plan (Plan). Her claim form, sup-\nported by a statement from her rheumatologist, listed her\nsymptoms as \u201c \u2018extreme fatigue, significant pain, and\ndifficulty in concentration.\u2019 \u201d1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. In\nNovember 2005, Hartford notified Heimeshoff that it could\nnot determine whether she was disabled because her\nrheumatologist had never responded to Hartford\u2019s request\nfor additional information. Hartford denied the claim the\nfollowing month for failure to provide satisfactory proof of\nloss. Hartford instructed Heimeshoff that it would con-\nsider an appeal filed within 180 days, but later informed her\nthat it would reopen her claim, without the need for an\nappeal, if her rheumatologist provided the requested\ninformation.\n   In July 2006, another physician evaluated Heimeshoff\nand concluded that she was disabled. Heimeshoff sub-\nmitted that evaluation and additional medical evidence\nin October 2006. Hartford then retained a physician to\nreview Heimeshoff \u2019s records and speak with her rheuma-\ntologist. That physician issued a report in November 2006\nconcluding that Heimeshoff was able to perform the activi-\nties required by her sedentary occupation. Hartford de-\nnied Heimeshoff \u2019s claim later that November.\n   In May 2007, Heimeshoff requested an extension of the\nPlan\u2019s appeal deadline until September 30, 2007, in order\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The insurance policy provides: \u201c \u2018Written proof of loss must be sent\n\nto The Hartford within 90 days after the start of the period for which\nThe Hartford owes payment. After that, The Hartford may require\nfurther written proof that you are still Disabled.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n10.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nto provide additional evidence. Hartford granted the\nextension. On September 26, 2007, Heimeshoff submitted\nher appeal along with additional cardiopulmonary and\nneuropsychological evaluations.       After two additional\nphysicians retained by Hartford reviewed the claim, Hart-\nford issued its final denial on November 26, 2007.\n   On November 18, 2010, almost three years later (but\nmore than three years after proof of loss was due),\nHeimeshoff filed suit in District Court seeking review of\nher denied claim pursuant to ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Hart-\nford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that\nHeimeshoff \u2019s complaint was barred by the Plan\u2019s limita-\ntions provision, which stated: \u201cLegal action cannot be\ntaken against The Hartford . . . [more than] 3 years after\nthe time written proof of loss is required to be furnished\naccording to the terms of the policy.\u201d Id., at 10.\n   The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. Rec-\nognizing that ERISA does not provide a statute of limita-\ntions for actions under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B), the court explained\nthat the limitations period provided by the most nearly\nanalogous state statute applies. See North Star Steel Co.\nv. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 33\u201334 (1995). Under Connecticut\nlaw, the Plan was permitted to specify a limitations period\nexpiring \u201c[not] less than one year from the time when the\nloss insured against occurs.\u201d2 Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a738a\u2013290\n(2012); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. The court held that,\nunder Circuit precedent, a 3-year limitations period set to\nbegin when proof of loss is due is enforceable, and\nHeimeshoff \u2019s claim was therefore untimely.3 Id., at 13, 15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The parties do not dispute that Connecticut provides the relevant\n\nstate law governing the limitations period in this case.\n  3 Heimeshoff also argued before the District Court that even if the\n\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision were enforceable, her suit was still timely\nbecause Hartford had granted her request for an extension until\nSeptember 30, 2007. Even crediting the contention that proof of loss\nwas not due until that date, the court held that the Plan\u2019s limitations\n4   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n(citing Burke v. PriceWaterHouseCoopers LLP Long Term\nDisability Plan, 572 F. 3d 76, 79\u201381 (CA2 2009) (per\ncuriam)).\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed. 496 Fed. Appx.\n129 (2012). Applying the precedent relied on by the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that it did\nnot offend ERISA for the limitations period to commence\nbefore the plaintiff could file suit under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B).\nBecause the policy language unambiguously provided that\nthe 3-year limitations period ran from the time that proof\nof loss was due under the Plan, and because Heimeshoff\nfiled her claim more than three years after that date, her\naction was time barred.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\nCourts of Appeals on the enforceability of this common\ncontractual limitations provision. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\nCompare, e.g., Burke, supra, at 79\u201381 (plan provision\nrequiring suit within three years after proof-of-loss dead-\nline is enforceable); and Rice v. Jefferson Pilot Financial\nIns. Co., 578 F. 3d 450, 455\u2013456 (CA6 2009) (same), with\nWhite v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 488 F. 3d 240,\n245\u2013248 (CA4 2007) (not enforceable); and Price v. Provi-\ndent Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 2 F. 3d 986, 988 (CA9 1993)\n(same). We now affirm.\n                               II\n  Statutes of limitations establish the period of time\nwithin which a claimant must bring an action. As a gen-\neral matter, a statute of limitations begins to run when\nthe cause of action \u201c \u2018accrues\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, when \u201cthe plaintiff\ncan file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Bay Area Laundry and Dry\nCleaning Pension Trust Fund v.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   ERISA and its regulations require plans to provide\ncertain presuit procedures for reviewing claims after par-\nticipants submit proof of loss (internal review). See 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71133; 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131 (2012). The courts of\nappeals have uniformly required that participants exhaust\ninternal review before bringing a claim for judicial review\nunder \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 258\u2013259 (2008) (ROBERTS,\nC. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A\nparticipant\u2019s cause of action under ERISA accordingly\ndoes not accrue until the plan issues a final denial.\n   ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) does not specify a statute of limita-\ntions. Instead, the parties in this case have agreed by\ncontract to a 3-year limitations period. The contract speci-\nfies that this period begins to run at the time proof of loss\nis due. Because proof of loss is due before a participant\ncan exhaust internal review, Heimeshoff contends that\nthis limitations provision runs afoul of the general rule\nthat statutes of limitations commence upon accrual of the\ncause of action.\n   For the reasons that follow, we reject that argument.\nAbsent a controlling statute to the contrary, a participant\nand a plan may agree by contract to a particular limita-\ntions period, even one that starts to run before the cause of\naction accrues, as long as the period is reasonable.\n                              A\n   Recognizing that Congress generally sets statutory\nlimitations periods to begin when their associated causes\nof action accrue, this Court has often construed statutes of\nlimitations to commence when the plaintiff is permitted to\nfile suit. See, e.g., Graham County Soil & Water Conserva-\ntion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409,\n418 (2005) (resolving an ambiguity in light of \u201cthe \u2018stand-\nard rule that the limitations period commences when the\nplaintiff has a complete and present cause of action\u2019 \u201d\n6   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Bay Area Laundry, supra, at 201)); Rawlings v.\nRay, 312 U. S. 96, 98 (1941). At the same time, we have\nrecognized that statutes of limitations do not inexorably\ncommence upon accrual. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S.\n258, 267 (1993) (noting the possibility that a cause of\naction may \u201caccru[e] at one time for the purpose of calcu-\nlating when the statute of limitations begins to run, but at\nanother time for the purpose of bringing suit\u201d); see also\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 358 (2005) (the\nstatute of limitations in the federal habeas statute runs\nfrom \u201c \u2018the date on which the right asserted was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court\u2019 \u201d even if the right has\nnot yet been \u201c \u2018made retroactively applicable to cases on\ncollateral review\u2019 \u201d); McMahon v. United States, 342 U. S.\n25, 26\u201327 (1951) (the limitations period in the Suits in\nAdmiralty Act runs from the date of injury rather than\nwhen plaintiffs may sue).\n   None of those decisions, however, addresses the critical\naspect of this case: the parties have agreed by contract to\ncommence the limitations period at a particular time. For\nthat reason, we find more appropriate guidance in prece-\ndent confronting whether to enforce the terms of a\ncontractual limitations provision. Those cases provide a\nwell-established framework suitable for resolving the ques-\ntion in this case:\n    \u201c[I]n the absence of a controlling statute to the con-\n    trary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, be-\n    tween the parties, the time for bringing an action on\n    such contract to a period less than that prescribed in\n    the general statute of limitations, provided that the\n    shorter period itself shall be a reasonable period.\u201d\n    Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v.\n    Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586, 608 (1947).\nWe have recognized that some statutes of limitations do\nnot permit parties to choose a shorter period by contract.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

The rule set forth in Wolfe recognizes, however,\nthat other statutes of limitations provide only a default\nrule that permits parties to choose a shorter limitations\nperiod. See Riddlesbarger v.

Co., 7 Wall.\n386, 390 (1869) (finding \u201cnothing in th[e] language or\nobject [of statutes of limitations] which inhibits parties\nfrom stipulating for a shorter period within which to as-\nsert their respective claims\u201d); see also Missouri, K. & T. R.\nCo. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657, 672\u2013673 (1913) (citing\nexamples). If parties are permitted to contract around a\ndefault statute of limitations, it follows that the same rule\napplies where the statute creating the cause of action is\nsilent regarding a limitations period.\n   The Wolfe rule necessarily allows parties to agree not\nonly to the length of a limitations period but also to its\ncommencement. The duration of a limitations period can\nbe measured only by reference to its start date. Each is\ntherefore an integral part of the limitations provision, and\nthere is no basis for categorically preventing parties from\nagreeing on one aspect but not the other. See Electrical\nWorkers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U. S. 229, 234\n(1976) (noting that \u201cthe parties could conceivably have\nagreed to a contract\u201d specifying the \u201c \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u201d that\ncommenced the statutory limitations period).\n                            B\n  The principle that contractual limitations provisions\nordinarily should be enforced as written is especially\nappropriate when enforcing an ERISA plan. \u201cThe plan, in\nshort, is at the center of ERISA.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v.\n8    HEIMESHOFF v.

Wolfe, 331 U. S.,\nat 608. Neither condition is met here.\n                              A\n   Neither Heimeshoff nor the United States claims that\nthe Plan\u2019s 3-year limitations provision is unreasonably\nshort on its face. And with good reason: the United States\nacknowledges that the regulations governing internal\nreview mean for \u201cmainstream\u201d claims to be resolved in\nabout one year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 22, leaving the participant\nwith two years to file suit.4 Even in this case, where the\nadministrative review process required more time than\nusual, Heimeshoff was left with approximately one year in\nwhich to file suit. Heimeshoff does not dispute that a\nhypothetical 1-year limitations period commencing at the\nconclusion of internal review would be reasonable. Id.,\nat 4. We cannot fault a limitations provision that would\nleave the same amount of time in a case with an unusually\nlong internal review process while providing for a signifi-\ncantly longer period in most cases.\n   Heimeshoff \u2019s reliance on Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal.\nv. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355 (1977), is therefore misplaced.\nThere, we declined to enforce a State\u2019s 1-year statute of\nlimitations as applied to Title VII employment discrimina-\ntion actions where the limitations period commenced\nbefore accrual. We concluded that \u201c[i]t would hardly be\nreasonable\u201d to suppose that Congress intended to enforce\nstate statutes of limitations as short as 12 months where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Heimeshoff, drawing on a study by the American Council of Life\n\nInsurers of recent \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) cases where timeliness was at issue,\nstates that exhaustion can take 15 to 16 months in a typical case.\nReply Brief 17\u201318, n. 3 (citing Brief for American Council of Life\nInsurers et al. as Amici Curiae 29). In our view, that still leaves ample\ntime for filing suit.\n10   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced a\nbacklog of 18 to 24 months, leaving claimants with little\nchance of bringing a claim not barred by the State\u2019s stat-\nute of limitations. Id., at 369\u2013371. In the absence of any\nevidence that there are similar obstacles to bringing a\ntimely \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claim, we conclude that the Plan\u2019s\nlimitations provision is reasonable.\n                              B\n   Heimeshoff and the United States contend that even if\nthe Plan\u2019s limitations provision is reasonable, ERISA is a\n\u201ccontrolling statute to the contrary.\u201d Wolfe, supra, at 608.\nBut they do not contend that ERISA\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions for claims of breach of fiduciary duty controls this\naction to recover benefits. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a71113. Nor do\nthey claim that ERISA\u2019s text or regulations contradict the\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision. Rather, they assert that the\nlimitations provision will \u201cundermine\u201d ERISA\u2019s two-tiered\nremedial scheme. Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 19. We cannot agree.\n                               1\n  The first tier of ERISA\u2019s remedial scheme is the internal\nreview process required for all ERISA disability-benefit\nplans. 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131. After the participant files a\nclaim for disability benefits, the plan has 45 days to make\nan \u201cadverse benefit determination.\u201d \u00a72560.503\u20131(f)(3).\nTwo 30-day extensions are available for \u201cmatters beyond\nthe control of the plan,\u201d giving the plan a total of up to 105\ndays to make that determination.

The\nplan\u2019s time for resolving an appeal can be tolled again if\nthe participant fails to submit necessary information.\n\u00a72560.503\u20131(i)(4). In the ordinary course, the regulations\ncontemplate an internal review process lasting about one\nyear. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. If the plan fails to meet its own\ndeadlines under these procedures, the participant \u201cshall\nbe deemed to have exhausted the administrative reme-\ndies.\u201d \u00a72560.503\u20131(l). Upon exhaustion of the internal\nreview process, the participant is entitled to proceed im-\nmediately to judicial review, the second tier of ERISA\u2019s\nremedial scheme.\n                              2\n  Heimeshoff and the United States first claim that the\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision will undermine the foregoing\ninternal review process. They contend that participants\nwill shortchange their own rights during that process in\norder to have more time in which to seek judicial review.\nTheir premise\u2014that participants will sacrifice the benefits\nof internal review to preserve additional time for filing\nsuit\u2014is highly dubious in light of the consequences of that\ncourse of action.\n  First, to the extent participants fail to develop evidence\nduring internal review, they risk forfeiting the use of that\nevidence in district court. The Courts of Appeals have\ngenerally limited the record for judicial review to the\nadministrative record compiled during internal review.\nSee, e.g., Foster v. PPG Industries, Inc., 693 F. 3d 1226,\n1231 (CA10 2012); Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 F. 3d\n116, 121 (CA3 2012); McCartha v. National City Corp.,\n419 F. 3d 437, 441 (CA6 2005). Second, participants are\nnot likely to value judicial review of plan determinations\nover internal review. Many plans (including this Plan)\n12   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvest discretion over benefits determinations in plan ad-\nministrators. See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch,\n489 U. S. 101, 111\u2013112 (1989) (permitting the vesting of\ndiscretion); see also App. in No. 12\u2013651\u2013cv (CA2), p. 34.\nCourts ordinarily review determinations by such plans\nonly for abuse of discretion. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.\nGlenn, 554 U. S. 105, 115\u2013116 (2008). In short, partici-\npants have much to lose and little to gain by giving up the\nfull measure of internal review in favor of marginal extra\ntime to seek judicial review.\n                              3\n   Heimeshoff and the United States next warn that it will\nendanger judicial review to allow plans to set limitations\nperiods that begin to run before internal review is com-\nplete. The United States suggests that administrators\nmay attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the\nresolution of claims in bad faith. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 19; see also White, 488 F. 3d, at 247\u2013\n248. But administrators are required by the regulations\ngoverning the internal review process to take prompt\naction, see supra, at 10\u201311, and the penalty for failure to\nmeet those deadlines is immediate access to judicial re-\nview for the participant. 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131(l). In addi-\ntion, that sort of dilatory behavior may implicate one of\nthe traditional defenses to a statute of limitations. See\ninfra, at 14\u201315.\n   The United States suggests that even good-faith admin-\nistration of internal review will significantly diminish the\navailability of judicial review if this limitations provision\nis enforced. Forty years of ERISA administration sug-\ngest otherwise. The limitations provision at issue is quite\ncommon; the vast majority of States require certain insur-\nance policies to include 3-year limitations periods that run\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the date proof of loss is due.5 But there is no signifi-\ncant evidence that limitations provisions like the one here\nhave similarly thwarted judicial review. As explained\nabove, see supra, at 10\u201311, ERISA regulations structure\ninternal review to proceed in an expeditious manner. It\nstands to reason that the cases in which internal review\nleaves participants with less than one year to file suit are\nrare. Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in\nwhich \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs are actually time barred as a\nresult of this 3-year limitations provision. See Abena v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins.

Those cases suggest that this barrier falls\non participants who have not diligently pursued their\nrights. See Abena, supra, at 884 (by his own admission,\nthere was \u201cno reason\u201d plaintiff could not have filed suit\nduring the remaining seven months of limitations period);\nSmith, supra, at *2 (plaintiff filed suit four years after the\nlimitations period expired, and six years after final de-\nnial); Rotondi, supra, at *8 (\u201cApplication of the . . . limita-\ntions period works no unfairness here\u201d); see also Rice, 578\nF. 3d, at 457 (the participant \u201chas not established that he\nhas been diligently pursuing his rights\u201d and \u201chas given no\nreason for his late filing\u201d); Burke, 572 F. 3d, at 81 (follow-\ning exhaustion, \u201ctwo years and five months of the limita-\ntions period remained\u201d); Salerno v.

If the administrator\u2019s conduct\ncauses a participant to miss the deadline for judicial re-\nview, waiver or estoppel may prevent the administrator\nfrom invoking the limitations provision as a defense.

Thus, we are not persuaded\nthat the Plan\u2019s limitations provision is inconsistent with\nERISA.\n                             C\n   Two additional arguments warrant mention. First,\nHeimeshoff argues\u2014for the first time in this litigation\u2014\nthat the limitations period should be tolled as a matter of\ncourse during internal review. By effectively delaying the\ncommencement of the limitations period until the conclu-\nsion of internal review, however, this approach reconsti-\ntutes the contractual revision we declined to make. As we\nexplained, the parties\u2019 agreement should be enforced\nunless the limitations period is unreasonably short or\nforeclosed by ERISA. The limitations period here is nei-\nther. See supra, at 9\u201310, 11\u201314, and this page.\n   Nor do the ERISA regulations require tolling during\ninternal review. A plan must agree to toll the limitations\nprovision only in one particular circumstance: when a plan\noffers voluntary internal appeals beyond what is permit-\nted by regulation. \u00a72560.503\u20131(c)(3)(ii). Even then, the\nlimitations period is tolled only during that specific por-\ntion of internal review. This limited tolling requirement\nwould be superfluous if the regulations contemplated\ntolling throughout the process.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Whether the Court of Appeals properly declined to apply those doc-\n\ntrines in this case is not before us. 569 U.

Straub, 490\nU. S. 536 (1989), Heimeshoff contends that we must in-\nquire whether state law would toll the limitations period\nthroughout the exhaustion process. In Hardin, we inter-\npreted 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 to borrow a State\u2019s statutory\nlimitations period. We recognized that when a federal\nstatute is deemed to borrow a State\u2019s limitations period,\nthe State\u2019s tolling rules are ordinarily borrowed as well\nbecause \u201c \u2018[i]n virtually all statutes of limitations the\nchronological length of the limitation period is interrelated\nwith provisions regarding tolling . . . .\u2019 \u201d 490 U.

HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT\n\n              INSURANCE CO. ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 12\u2013729.      Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided December 16, 2013\nRespondent Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) is the\n  administrator of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\u2019s (Wal-Mart) Group Long\n  Term Disability Plan (Plan), an employee benefit plan covered by the\n  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The\n  Plan\u2019s insurance policy requires any suit to recover benefits pursuant\n  to the judicial review provision in ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B), 29 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71132(a)(1)(B), to be filed within three years after \u201cproof of loss\u201d is\n  due. Petitioner Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-term disability ben-\n  efits with Hartford. After petitioner exhausted the mandatory ad-\n  ministrative review process, Hartford issued its final denial. Almost\n  three years after that final denial but more than three years after\n  proof of loss was due, Heimeshoff filed a claim for judicial review pur-\n  suant to ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Hartford and Wal-Mart moved to dis-\n  miss on the ground that the claim was untimely. The District Court\n  granted the motion, recognizing that while ERISA does not provide a\n  statute of limitations, the contractual 3-year limitations period was\n  enforceable under applicable State law and Circuit precedent. The\n  Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Plan\u2019s limitations provision is enforceable. Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) The courts of appeals require participants in an employee bene-\n fit plan covered by ERISA to exhaust the plan\u2019s administrative reme-\n dies before filing suit to recover benefits. A plan participant\u2019s cause\n of action under ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) therefore does not accrue until\n the plan issues a final denial. But it does not follow that a plan and\n its participants cannot agree to commence the limitations period be-\n fore that time. Pp. 4\u20138.\n      (1) The rule set forth in Order of United Commercial Travelers of\n2      HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    America v. Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586, 608, provides that a contractual limi-\n    tations provision is enforceable so long as the limitations period is of\n    reasonable length and there is no controlling statute to the contrary.\n    That is the appropriate framework for determining the enforceability\n    of the Plan\u2019s limitations provision. The Wolfe approach necessarily\n    allows parties to agree both to the length of a limitations period and\n    to its commencement. Pp. 5\u20137.\n         (2) The principle that contractual limitations provisions should\n    ordinarily be enforced as written is especially appropriate in the con-\n    text of an ERISA plan. Heimeshoff\u2019s cause of action is bound up with\n    the written terms of the Plan, and ERISA authorizes a participant to\n    bring suit \u201cto enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.\u201d\n    \u00a71132(a)(1)(B). This Court has thus recognized the particular im-\n    portance of enforcing plan terms as written in \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claims,\n    see, e.g., CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and will not pre-\n    sume from statutory silence that Congress intended a different ap-\n    proach here. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (b) Unless the limitations period is unreasonably short or there is a\n    \u201ccontrolling statute to the contrary,\u201d Wolfe, supra, at 608, the Plan\u2019s\n    limitations provision must be given effect. Pp. 8\u201316.\n         (1) The Plan\u2019s period is not unreasonably short. Applicable regu-\n    lations mean for mainstream claims to be resolved by plans in about\n    one year. Here, the Plan\u2019s administrative review process (\u201cinternal\n    review\u201d) required more time than usual but still left Heimeshoff with\n    approximately one year to file suit. Her reliance on Occidental Life\n    Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, in which this Court declined\n    to enforce a 12-month statute of limitations applied to Title VII em-\n    ployment discrimination actions where the Equal Employment Op-\n    portunity Commission faced an 18- to 24-month backlog, is unavail-\n    ing in the absence of any evidence that similar obstacles exist to\n    bringing a timely ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claim. Pp. 9\u201310.\n         (2) This Court rejects the contentions of Heimeshoff and the\n    United States that the limitations provision is unenforceable because\n    it will undermine ERISA\u2019s two-tiered remedial scheme. Pp. 10\u201315.\n            (i) Enforcement of the Plan\u2019s limitation provision is unlikely to\n    cause participants to shortchange the internal review process. The\n    record for judicial review generally has been limited to the adminis-\n    trative record, so participants who fail to develop evidence during in-\n    ternal review risk forfeiting the use of that evidence in district court.\n    In addition, many plans vest discretion over benefits determinations\n    in the plan administrator, and courts ordinarily review such deter-\n    minations only for abuse of discretion. Pp. 11\u201312.\n            (ii) It is also unlikely that enforcing limitations periods that\n    begin to run before the internal review process is exhausted will en-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  danger judicial review. To the extent that administrators attempt to\n  prevent judicial review by delaying the resolution of claims in bad\n  faith, the penalty for failure to meet the regulatory deadlines is im-\n  mediate access to judicial review for the participant. Evidence from\n  forty years of ERISA administration of this common contractual pro-\n  vision suggests that the good-faith administration of internal review\n  will not diminish the availability of judicial review either.\n  Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in which ERISA\n  \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs have been time barred as a result of the 3-\n  year limitations provision, and these cases suggest that the bar falls\n  on participants who have not diligently pursued their rights. More-\n  over, courts are well equipped to apply traditional doctrines, such as\n  waiver or estoppel, see, e.g., Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., 136 U. S.\n  287, 298\u2013299, and equitable tolling, see, e.g., Irwin v. Department of\n  Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95, that nevertheless may allow partic-\n  ipants to proceed. Finally, plans offering appeals or dispute resolu-\n  tion beyond what is contemplated in the internal review regulations\n  must agree to toll the limitations provision during that time. 29 CFR\n  \u00a72560.503\u20131(c)(3)(ii). Pp. 12\u201315.\n       (3) Heimeshoff\u2019s additional arguments are unpersuasive. The\n  limitations period need not be tolled as a matter of course during in-\n  ternal review because that would be inconsistent with the text of the\n  limitations provision, which is enforceable. And federal courts need\n  not inquire whether state law would toll the limitations period during\n  internal review because the limitations period is set by contract, not\n  borrowed from state law.

HARTFORD \n\n     LIFE & ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO. ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                              [December 16, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   A participant in an employee benefit plan covered by\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\n(ERISA), 88 Stat. 829, as amended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et\nseq., may bring a civil action under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) to re-\ncover benefits due under the terms of the plan. 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a71132(a)(1)(B). Courts have generally required partici-\npants to exhaust the plan\u2019s administrative remedies before\nfiling suit to recover benefits. ERISA does not, however,\nspecify a statute of limitations for filing suit under\n\u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Filling that gap, the plan at issue here\nrequires participants to bring suit within three years after\n\u201cproof of loss\u201d is due. Because proof of loss is due before\na plan\u2019s administrative process can be completed, the ad-\nministrative exhaustion requirement will, in practice,\nshorten the contractual limitations period. The question\npresented is whether the contractual limitations provision\nis enforceable. We hold that it is.\n                             I\n  In 2005, petitioner Julie Heimeshoff began to report\nchronic pain and fatigue that interfered with her duties as\n2    HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\na senior public relations manager for Wal-Mart Stores,\nInc. Her physician later diagnosed her with lupus and\nfibromyalgia. Heimeshoff stopped working on June 8.\n   On August 22, 2005, Heimeshoff filed a claim for long-\nterm disability benefits with Hartford Life & Accident\nInsurance Co., the administrator of Wal-Mart\u2019s Group\nLong Term Disability Plan (Plan). Her claim form, sup-\nported by a statement from her rheumatologist, listed her\nsymptoms as \u201c \u2018extreme fatigue, significant pain, and\ndifficulty in concentration.\u2019 \u201d1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 7. In\nNovember 2005, Hartford notified Heimeshoff that it could\nnot determine whether she was disabled because her\nrheumatologist had never responded to Hartford\u2019s request\nfor additional information. Hartford denied the claim the\nfollowing month for failure to provide satisfactory proof of\nloss. Hartford instructed Heimeshoff that it would con-\nsider an appeal filed within 180 days, but later informed her\nthat it would reopen her claim, without the need for an\nappeal, if her rheumatologist provided the requested\ninformation.\n   In July 2006, another physician evaluated Heimeshoff\nand concluded that she was disabled. Heimeshoff sub-\nmitted that evaluation and additional medical evidence\nin October 2006. Hartford then retained a physician to\nreview Heimeshoff \u2019s records and speak with her rheuma-\ntologist. That physician issued a report in November 2006\nconcluding that Heimeshoff was able to perform the activi-\nties required by her sedentary occupation. Hartford de-\nnied Heimeshoff \u2019s claim later that November.\n   In May 2007, Heimeshoff requested an extension of the\nPlan\u2019s appeal deadline until September 30, 2007, in order\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The insurance policy provides: \u201c \u2018Written proof of loss must be sent\n\nto The Hartford within 90 days after the start of the period for which\nThe Hartford owes payment. After that, The Hartford may require\nfurther written proof that you are still Disabled.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert.\n10.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

On September 26, 2007, Heimeshoff submitted\nher appeal along with additional cardiopulmonary and\nneuropsychological evaluations.       After two additional\nphysicians retained by Hartford reviewed the claim, Hart-\nford issued its final denial on November 26, 2007.\n   On November 18, 2010, almost three years later (but\nmore than three years after proof of loss was due),\nHeimeshoff filed suit in District Court seeking review of\nher denied claim pursuant to ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). Hart-\nford and Wal-Mart moved to dismiss on the ground that\nHeimeshoff \u2019s complaint was barred by the Plan\u2019s limita-\ntions provision, which stated: \u201cLegal action cannot be\ntaken against The Hartford . . . [more than] 3 years after\nthe time written proof of loss is required to be furnished\naccording to the terms of the policy.\u201d Id., at 10.\n   The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. Rec-\nognizing that ERISA does not provide a statute of limita-\ntions for actions under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B), the court explained\nthat the limitations period provided by the most nearly\nanalogous state statute applies. See North Star Steel Co.\nv. Thomas, 515 U. S. 29, 33\u201334 (1995). Under Connecticut\nlaw, the Plan was permitted to specify a limitations period\nexpiring \u201c[not] less than one year from the time when the\nloss insured against occurs.\u201d2 Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a738a\u2013290\n(2012); see App. to Pet. for Cert. 13. The court held that,\nunder Circuit precedent, a 3-year limitations period set to\nbegin when proof of loss is due is enforceable, and\nHeimeshoff \u2019s claim was therefore untimely.3 Id., at 13, 15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The parties do not dispute that Connecticut provides the relevant\n\nstate law governing the limitations period in this case.\n  3 Heimeshoff also argued before the District Court that even if the\n\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision were enforceable, her suit was still timely\nbecause Hartford had granted her request for an extension until\nSeptember 30, 2007. Even crediting the contention that proof of loss\nwas not due until that date, the court held that the Plan\u2019s limitations\n4   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS.

PriceWaterHouseCoopers LLP Long Term\nDisability Plan, 572 F. 3d 76, 79\u201381 (CA2 2009) (per\ncuriam)).\n   On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed. 496 Fed. Appx.\n129 (2012). Applying the precedent relied on by the Dis-\ntrict Court, the Court of Appeals concluded that it did\nnot offend ERISA for the limitations period to commence\nbefore the plaintiff could file suit under \u00a7502(a)(1)(B).\nBecause the policy language unambiguously provided that\nthe 3-year limitations period ran from the time that proof\nof loss was due under the Plan, and because Heimeshoff\nfiled her claim more than three years after that date, her\naction was time barred.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the\nCourts of Appeals on the enforceability of this common\ncontractual limitations provision. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\nCompare, e.g., Burke, supra, at 79\u201381 (plan provision\nrequiring suit within three years after proof-of-loss dead-\nline is enforceable); and Rice v. Jefferson Pilot Financial\nIns. Co., 578 F. 3d 450, 455\u2013456 (CA6 2009) (same), with\nWhite v.

We now affirm.\n                               II\n  Statutes of limitations establish the period of time\nwithin which a claimant must bring an action.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   ERISA and its regulations require plans to provide\ncertain presuit procedures for reviewing claims after par-\nticipants submit proof of loss (internal review). See 29\nU. S. C. \u00a71133; 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131 (2012). The courts of\nappeals have uniformly required that participants exhaust\ninternal review before bringing a claim for judicial review\nunder \u00a7502(a)(1)(B). See LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg &\nAssociates, Inc., 552 U. S. 248, 258\u2013259 (2008) (ROBERTS,\nC. J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A\nparticipant\u2019s cause of action under ERISA accordingly\ndoes not accrue until the plan issues a final denial.\n   ERISA \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) does not specify a statute of limita-\ntions. Instead, the parties in this case have agreed by\ncontract to a 3-year limitations period. The contract speci-\nfies that this period begins to run at the time proof of loss\nis due. Because proof of loss is due before a participant\ncan exhaust internal review, Heimeshoff contends that\nthis limitations provision runs afoul of the general rule\nthat statutes of limitations commence upon accrual of the\ncause of action.\n   For the reasons that follow, we reject that argument.\nAbsent a controlling statute to the contrary, a participant\nand a plan may agree by contract to a particular limita-\ntions period, even one that starts to run before the cause of\naction accrues, as long as the period is reasonable.\n                              A\n   Recognizing that Congress generally sets statutory\nlimitations periods to begin when their associated causes\nof action accrue, this Court has often construed statutes of\nlimitations to commence when the plaintiff is permitted to\nfile suit. See, e.g., Graham County Soil & Water Conserva-\ntion Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U. S. 409,\n418 (2005) (resolving an ambiguity in light of \u201cthe \u2018stand-\nard rule that the limitations period commences when the\nplaintiff has a complete and present cause of action\u2019 \u201d\n6   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Bay Area Laundry, supra, at 201)); Rawlings v.\nRay, 312 U. S. 96, 98 (1941). At the same time, we have\nrecognized that statutes of limitations do not inexorably\ncommence upon accrual. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S.\n258, 267 (1993) (noting the possibility that a cause of\naction may \u201caccru[e] at one time for the purpose of calcu-\nlating when the statute of limitations begins to run, but at\nanother time for the purpose of bringing suit\u201d); see also\nDodd v. United States, 545 U. S. 353, 358 (2005) (the\nstatute of limitations in the federal habeas statute runs\nfrom \u201c \u2018the date on which the right asserted was initially\nrecognized by the Supreme Court\u2019 \u201d even if the right has\nnot yet been \u201c \u2018made retroactively applicable to cases on\ncollateral review\u2019 \u201d); McMahon v. United States, 342 U. S.\n25, 26\u201327 (1951) (the limitations period in the Suits in\nAdmiralty Act runs from the date of injury rather than\nwhen plaintiffs may sue).\n   None of those decisions, however, addresses the critical\naspect of this case: the parties have agreed by contract to\ncommence the limitations period at a particular time. For\nthat reason, we find more appropriate guidance in prece-\ndent confronting whether to enforce the terms of a\ncontractual limitations provision. Those cases provide a\nwell-established framework suitable for resolving the ques-\ntion in this case:\n    \u201c[I]n the absence of a controlling statute to the con-\n    trary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, be-\n    tween the parties, the time for bringing an action on\n    such contract to a period less than that prescribed in\n    the general statute of limitations, provided that the\n    shorter period itself shall be a reasonable period.\u201d\n    Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v.\n    Wolfe, 331 U.

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">386</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (1869) (finding \u201cnothing in th[e] language or\nobject [of statutes of limitations] which inhibits parties\nfrom stipulating for a shorter period within which to as-\nsert their respective claims\u201d); see also Missouri, K. & T. R.\nCo. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657, 672\u2013673 (1913) (citing\nexamples). If parties are permitted to contract around a\ndefault statute of limitations, it follows that the same rule\napplies where the statute creating the cause of action is\nsilent regarding a limitations period.\n   The Wolfe rule necessarily allows parties to agree not\nonly to the length of a limitations period but also to its\ncommencement. The duration of a limitations period can\nbe measured only by reference to its start date. Each is\ntherefore an integral part of the limitations provision, and\nthere is no basis for categorically preventing parties from\nagreeing on one aspect but not the other. See Electrical\nWorkers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U. S. 229, 234\n(1976) (noting that \u201cthe parties could conceivably have\nagreed to a contract\u201d specifying the \u201c \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u201d that\ncommenced the statutory limitations period).\n                            B\n  The principle that contractual limitations provisions\nordinarily should be enforced as written is especially\nappropriate when enforcing an ERISA plan. \u201cThe plan, in\nshort, is at the center of ERISA.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v.\n8    HEIMESHOFF v.

Wolfe, 331 U. S.,\nat 608. Neither condition is met here.\n                              A\n   Neither Heimeshoff nor the United States claims that\nthe Plan\u2019s 3-year limitations provision is unreasonably\nshort on its face. And with good reason: the United States\nacknowledges that the regulations governing internal\nreview mean for \u201cmainstream\u201d claims to be resolved in\nabout one year, Tr. of Oral Arg. 22, leaving the participant\nwith two years to file suit.4 Even in this case, where the\nadministrative review process required more time than\nusual, Heimeshoff was left with approximately one year in\nwhich to file suit. Heimeshoff does not dispute that a\nhypothetical 1-year limitations period commencing at the\nconclusion of internal review would be reasonable. Id.,\nat 4. We cannot fault a limitations provision that would\nleave the same amount of time in a case with an unusually\nlong internal review process while providing for a signifi-\ncantly longer period in most cases.\n   Heimeshoff \u2019s reliance on Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal.\nv. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355 (1977), is therefore misplaced.\nThere, we declined to enforce a State\u2019s 1-year statute of\nlimitations as applied to Title VII employment discrimina-\ntion actions where the limitations period commenced\nbefore accrual. We concluded that \u201c[i]t would hardly be\nreasonable\u201d to suppose that Congress intended to enforce\nstate statutes of limitations as short as 12 months where\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Heimeshoff, drawing on a study by the American Council of Life\n\nInsurers of recent \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) cases where timeliness was at issue,\nstates that exhaustion can take 15 to 16 months in a typical case.\nReply Brief 17\u201318, n. 3 (citing Brief for American Council of Life\nInsurers et al. as Amici Curiae 29). In our view, that still leaves ample\ntime for filing suit.\n10   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission faced a\nbacklog of 18 to 24 months, leaving claimants with little\nchance of bringing a claim not barred by the State\u2019s stat-\nute of limitations. Id., at 369\u2013371. In the absence of any\nevidence that there are similar obstacles to bringing a\ntimely \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) claim, we conclude that the Plan\u2019s\nlimitations provision is reasonable.\n                              B\n   Heimeshoff and the United States contend that even if\nthe Plan\u2019s limitations provision is reasonable, ERISA is a\n\u201ccontrolling statute to the contrary.\u201d Wolfe, supra, at 608.\nBut they do not contend that ERISA\u2019s statute of limita-\ntions for claims of breach of fiduciary duty controls this\naction to recover benefits. See 29 U. S. C. \u00a71113. Nor do\nthey claim that ERISA\u2019s text or regulations contradict the\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision. Rather, they assert that the\nlimitations provision will \u201cundermine\u201d ERISA\u2019s two-tiered\nremedial scheme. Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 19. We cannot agree.\n                               1\n  The first tier of ERISA\u2019s remedial scheme is the internal\nreview process required for all ERISA disability-benefit\nplans. 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131. After the participant files a\nclaim for disability benefits, the plan has 45 days to make\nan \u201cadverse benefit determination.\u201d \u00a72560.503\u20131(f)(3).\nTwo 30-day extensions are available for \u201cmatters beyond\nthe control of the plan,\u201d giving the plan a total of up to 105\ndays to make that determination.

The\nplan\u2019s time for resolving an appeal can be tolled again if\nthe participant fails to submit necessary information.\n\u00a72560.503\u20131(i)(4). In the ordinary course, the regulations\ncontemplate an internal review process lasting about one\nyear. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. If the plan fails to meet its own\ndeadlines under these procedures, the participant \u201cshall\nbe deemed to have exhausted the administrative reme-\ndies.\u201d \u00a72560.503\u20131(l). Upon exhaustion of the internal\nreview process, the participant is entitled to proceed im-\nmediately to judicial review, the second tier of ERISA\u2019s\nremedial scheme.\n                              2\n  Heimeshoff and the United States first claim that the\nPlan\u2019s limitations provision will undermine the foregoing\ninternal review process. They contend that participants\nwill shortchange their own rights during that process in\norder to have more time in which to seek judicial review.\nTheir premise\u2014that participants will sacrifice the benefits\nof internal review to preserve additional time for filing\nsuit\u2014is highly dubious in light of the consequences of that\ncourse of action.\n  First, to the extent participants fail to develop evidence\nduring internal review, they risk forfeiting the use of that\nevidence in district court. The Courts of Appeals have\ngenerally limited the record for judicial review to the\nadministrative record compiled during internal review.\nSee, e.g., Foster v. PPG Industries, Inc., 693 F. 3d 1226,\n1231 (CA10 2012); Fleisher v. Standard Ins. Co., 679 F. 3d\n116, 121 (CA3 2012); McCartha v. National City Corp.,\n419 F. 3d 437, 441 (CA6 2005). Second, participants are\nnot likely to value judicial review of plan determinations\nover internal review. Many plans (including this Plan)\n12   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvest discretion over benefits determinations in plan ad-\nministrators. See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch,\n489 U. S. 101, 111\u2013112 (1989) (permitting the vesting of\ndiscretion); see also App. in No. 12\u2013651\u2013cv (CA2), p. 34.\nCourts ordinarily review determinations by such plans\nonly for abuse of discretion. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.\nGlenn, 554 U. S. 105, 115\u2013116 (2008). In short, partici-\npants have much to lose and little to gain by giving up the\nfull measure of internal review in favor of marginal extra\ntime to seek judicial review.\n                              3\n   Heimeshoff and the United States next warn that it will\nendanger judicial review to allow plans to set limitations\nperiods that begin to run before internal review is com-\nplete. The United States suggests that administrators\nmay attempt to prevent judicial review by delaying the\nresolution of claims in bad faith. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 19; see also White, 488 F. 3d, at 247\u2013\n248. But administrators are required by the regulations\ngoverning the internal review process to take prompt\naction, see supra, at 10\u201311, and the penalty for failure to\nmeet those deadlines is immediate access to judicial re-\nview for the participant. 29 CFR \u00a72560.503\u20131(l). In addi-\ntion, that sort of dilatory behavior may implicate one of\nthe traditional defenses to a statute of limitations. See\ninfra, at 14\u201315.\n   The United States suggests that even good-faith admin-\nistration of internal review will significantly diminish the\navailability of judicial review if this limitations provision\nis enforced. Forty years of ERISA administration sug-\ngest otherwise. The limitations provision at issue is quite\ncommon; the vast majority of States require certain insur-\nance policies to include 3-year limitations periods that run\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfrom the date proof of loss is due.5 But there is no signifi-\ncant evidence that limitations provisions like the one here\nhave similarly thwarted judicial review. As explained\nabove, see supra, at 10\u201311, ERISA regulations structure\ninternal review to proceed in an expeditious manner. It\nstands to reason that the cases in which internal review\nleaves participants with less than one year to file suit are\nrare. Heimeshoff identifies only a handful of cases in\nwhich \u00a7502(a)(1)(B) plaintiffs are actually time barred as a\nresult of this 3-year limitations provision. See Abena v.\nMetropolitan Life Ins.

Thus, we are not persuaded\nthat the Plan\u2019s limitations provision is inconsistent with\nERISA.\n                             C\n   Two additional arguments warrant mention. First,\nHeimeshoff argues\u2014for the first time in this litigation\u2014\nthat the limitations period should be tolled as a matter of\ncourse during internal review. By effectively delaying the\ncommencement of the limitations period until the conclu-\nsion of internal review, however, this approach reconsti-\ntutes the contractual revision we declined to make. As we\nexplained, the parties\u2019 agreement should be enforced\nunless the limitations period is unreasonably short or\nforeclosed by ERISA. The limitations period here is nei-\nther. See supra, at 9\u201310, 11\u201314, and this page.\n   Nor do the ERISA regulations require tolling during\ninternal review. A plan must agree to toll the limitations\nprovision only in one particular circumstance: when a plan\noffers voluntary internal appeals beyond what is permit-\nted by regulation. \u00a72560.503\u20131(c)(3)(ii). Even then, the\nlimitations period is tolled only during that specific por-\ntion of internal review. This limited tolling requirement\nwould be superfluous if the regulations contemplated\ntolling throughout the process.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Whether the Court of Appeals properly declined to apply those doc-\n\ntrines in this case is not before us. 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013); Pet. for\nCert. i.\n16   HEIMESHOFF v. HARTFORD LIFE & ACCIDENT INS. CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Finally, relying on our decision in Hardin v. Straub, 490\nU. S. 536 (1989), Heimeshoff contends that we must in-\nquire whether state law would toll the limitations period\nthroughout the exhaustion process. In Hardin, we inter-\npreted 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 to borrow a State\u2019s statutory\nlimitations period. We recognized that when a federal\nstatute is deemed to borrow a State\u2019s limitations period,\nthe State\u2019s tolling rules are ordinarily borrowed as well\nbecause \u201c \u2018[i]n virtually all statutes of limitations the\nchronological length of the limitation period is interrelated\nwith provisions regarding tolling . . . .\u2019 \u201d 490 U. S., at 539\n(quoting Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421\nU. S. 454, 464 (1975)); see also Board of Regents of Univ. of\nState of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478, 484 (1980) (in\n\u00a71983 actions \u201ca state statute of limitations and the coor-\ndinate tolling rules\u201d are \u201cbinding rules of law\u201d). But here,\nunlike in Hardin, the parties have adopted a limitations\nperiod by contract. Under these circumstances, where\nthere is no need to borrow a state statute of limitations\nthere is no need to borrow concomitant state tolling rules.\n                            IV\n  We hold that the Plan\u2019s limitations provision is enforce-\nable. The judgment is, accordingly, affirmed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
