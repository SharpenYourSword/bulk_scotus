NIKE, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u2013982.      Argued November 7, 2012\u2014Decided January 9, 2013\nNike filed this suit, alleging that two of Already\u2019s athletic shoes violat-\n  ed Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 trademark. Already denied the allegations and\n  filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nike\u2019s Air Force 1\n  trademark. While the suit was pending, Nike issued a \u201cCovenant\n  Not to Sue,\u201d promising not to raise any trademark or unfair competi-\n  tion claims against Already or any affiliated entity based on Al-\n  ready\u2019s existing footwear designs, or any future Already designs that\n  constituted a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of Already\u2019s current products.\n  Nike then moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice, and to dismiss\n  Already\u2019s counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the cov-\n  enant had extinguished the case or controversy. Already opposed\n  dismissal of its counterclaim, contending that Nike had not estab-\n  lished that its covenant had mooted the case. In support, Already\n  presented an affidavit from its president, stating that Already\n  planned to introduce new versions of its lines into the market; affida-\n  vits from three potential investors, asserting that they would not\n  consider investing in Already until Nike\u2019s trademark was invalidat-\n  ed; and an affidavit from an Already executive, stating that Nike had\n  intimidated retailers into refusing to carry Already\u2019s shoes. The Dis-\n  trict Court dismissed Already\u2019s counterclaim, concluding that there\n  was no longer a justiciable controversy. The Second Circuit affirmed.\n  It explained that the covenant was broadly drafted; that the court\n  could not conceive of a shoe that would infringe Nike\u2019s trademark yet\n  not fall within the covenant; and that Already had not asserted any\n  intent to market such a shoe.\nHeld: This case is moot. Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) A case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer a \u201cCase\u201d or \u201cCon-\n troversy\u201d for Article III purposes\u2014\u201cwhen the issues presented are no\n2                     ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the\n    outcome.\u201d Murphy v. Hunt, 455 U. S. 478, 481. A defendant cannot,\n    however, automatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful\n    conduct once sued. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., 455\n    U. S. 283, 289. Instead, \u201ca defendant claiming that its voluntary\n    compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that\n    it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not rea-\n    sonably be expected to recur.\u201d Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\n    Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 190. Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (b) Nike has the burden to show that it \u201ccould not reasonably be\n    expected\u201d to resume its enforcement efforts against Already. The\n    voluntary cessation doctrine was not disavowed in Deakins v. Mona-\n    ghan, 484 U. S. 193. There, the Court employed precisely the analy-\n    sis the test requires, finding a case moot because the challenged ac-\n    tion\u2014pursuing a claim in court\u2014could not be resumed in \u201cthis or any\n    subsequent action\u201d and because it was entirely \u201c \u2018speculative\u2019 \u201d that\n    any similar claim would arise in the future. Id., at 201, n. 4. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (c) Application of the voluntary cessation doctrine shows that this\n    case is moot. Pp. 6\u201314.\n          (1) The breadth of the covenant suffices to meet the burden im-\n    posed by the doctrine. The covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.\n    It prohibits Nike from filing suit or making any claim or demand;\n    protects both Already and Already\u2019s distributors and customers; and\n    covers not just current or previous designs, but also colorable imita-\n    tions. Once Nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of\n    Already\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct, it became incumbent on Al-\n    ready to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans\n    to engage in activities that would arguably infringe Nike\u2019s trademark\n    yet not be covered by the covenant. But Already failed to do so in the\n    courts below or in this Court. The case is thus moot because the chal-\n    lenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur. Cardinal\n    Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83, and Altvater v. Free-\n    man, 319 U. S. 359, distinguished. Pp. 6\u20139.\n          (2) Already\u2019s alternative theories of Article III injuries do not\n    save the case from mootness, because none of those injuries suffices\n    to support Article III standing in the first place. Already argues that\n    as long as Nike is free to assert its trademark, investors will hesitate\n    to invest in Already. But once it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that challenged\n    conduct cannot \u201creasonably be expected to recur,\u201d Friends of the\n    Earth, supra, at 190, the fact that some individuals may base deci-\n    sions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to\n    the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish Article\n    III standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. Al-\n    ready worries about its retailers, but even if a plaintiff may bring an\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark\n  holder will take action against the plaintiff \u2019s retailers, the covenant\n  here extends protection to Already\u2019s distributors and customers. Al-\n  ready also complains that Nike\u2019s decision to sue in the first place has\n  led Already to fear another suit. But, since Nike has met its burden\n  to demonstrate that there is no reasonable risk of such a suit, this\n  concern is unfounded. Already falls back on the sweeping argument\n  that, as one of Nike\u2019s competitors, it inherently has standing because\n  no covenant can eradicate the effects of a registered but invalid\n  trademark. The logical conclusion of this theory seems to be that a\n  market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a\n  competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\u2014e.g., a\n  trademark or the awarding of a contract\u2014but this Court has never\n  accepted such a boundless theory of standing.\n     Already\u2019s policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to\n  bully small innovators does not support adoption of this broad theory.\n  Granting covenants not to sue may be a risky long-term strategy for a\n  trademark holder. And while accepting Already\u2019s theory may benefit\n  the small competitor in this case, it also lowers the gates for larger\n  companies with more resources, who may challenge the intellectual\n  property portfolios of more humble rivals simply because they are\n  competitors in the same market. This would further encourage par-\n  ties to employ litigation as a weapon against their competitors rather\n  than as a last resort for settling disputes. Pp. 9\u201314.\n     (d) No purpose would be served by remanding the case. Already\n  has had every opportunity and incentive to submit evidence in the\n  proceedings below. It has refused, at every stage of the proceedings,\n  to suggest that it has any plans to design a shoe that violates the Air\n  Force 1 trademark yet falls outside the covenant. And while the\n  courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary cessation stand-\n  ard, their analysis addressed the same questions this Court address-\n  es here under that standard.

Petitioner Already also designs and markets\nathletic footwear, including shoe lines known as \u201cSugars\u201d\nand \u201cSoulja Boys.\u201d Nike, alleging that the Soulja Boys in-\nfringed and diluted the Air Force 1 trademark, demanded\nthat Already cease and desist its sale of those shoes.\nWhen Already refused, Nike filed suit in federal court\nalleging that the Soulja Boys as well as the Sugars in-\nfringed and diluted its Air Force 1 trademark. Already\ndenied these allegations and filed a counterclaim contend-\ning that the Air Force 1 trademark is invalid.\n   In March 2010, eight months after Nike filed its com-\nplaint, and four months after Already counterclaimed,\n2               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNike issued a \u201cCovenant Not to Sue.\u201d Its preamble stated\nthat \u201cAlready\u2019s actions . . . no longer infringe or dilute\nthe NIKE Mark at a level sufficient to warrant the substan-\ntial time and expense of continued litigation.\u201d App. 96a.\nThe covenant promised that Nike would not raise against\nAlready or any affiliated entity any trademark or unfair\ncompetition claim based on any of Already\u2019s existing foot-\nwear designs, or any future Already designs that consti-\ntuted a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of Already\u2019s current products.\nId., at 96a\u201397a.\n   After issuing this covenant, Nike moved to dismiss its\nclaims with prejudice, and to dismiss Already\u2019s invalid-\nity counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the\ncovenant had extinguished the case or controversy. Al-\nready opposed dismissal of its counterclaim, arguing that\nNike had not established that its voluntary cessation had\nmooted the case. In support, Already presented an affi-\ndavit from its president, stating that Already had plans to\nintroduce new versions of its shoe lines into the market;\naffidavits from three potential investors, asserting that\nthey would not consider investing in Already until Nike\u2019s\ntrademark was invalidated; and an affidavit from one of\nAlready\u2019s executives, stating that Nike had intimidated\nretailers into refusing to carry Already\u2019s shoes.\n   The District Court dismissed Already\u2019s counterclaim,\nstating that because Already sought \u201cto invoke the Court\u2019s\ndeclaratory judgment jurisdiction, it bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that the Court has subject matter jurisdic-\ntion over its counterclaim[ ].\u201d Civ. No. 09\u20136366 (SDNY,\nJan. 20, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a. The Court\nread the covenant \u201cbroad[ly],\u201d concluding that \u201cany of [Al-\nready\u2019s] future products that arguably infringed the Nike\nMark would be \u2018colorable imitations\u2019 \u201d of Already\u2019s current\nfootwear and therefore protected by the covenant. Id., at\n29a, n. 2. Finding no evidence that Already sought to\ndevelop any shoes not covered by the covenant, the Court\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nheld there was no longer \u201ca substantial controversy . . . of\nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance\nof a declaratory judgment.\u201d Id., at 34a (quoting Med-\nImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127 (2007)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. It held that in determin-\ning whether a covenant not to sue \u201celiminates a justiciable\ncase or controversy,\u201d courts should look to the totality\nof the circumstances, including \u201c(1) the language of the\ncovenant, (2) whether the covenant covers future, as well\nas past, activity and products, and (3) evidence of inten-\ntion . . . on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction\u201d to\nengage in conduct not covered by the covenant. 663 F. 3d\n89, 96 (2011) (footnote omitted). Noting that the covenant\ncovers \u201cboth past sales and future sales of both existing\nproducts and colorable imitations,\u201d the Second Circuit\nfound it hard to conceive of a shoe that would infringe the\nAir Force 1 trademark yet not fall within the covenant.\nId., at 97. Given that Already \u201cha[d] not asserted any\nintention to market any such shoe,\u201d the court concluded\nthat Already could not show any continuing injury, and\nthat therefore no justiciable controversy remained. Ibid.\nWe granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Article III of the Constitution grants the Judicial\nBranch authority to adjudicate \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControver-\nsies.\u201d In our system of government, courts have \u201cno busi-\nness\u201d deciding legal disputes or expounding on law in the\nabsence of such a case or controversy. DaimlerChrysler\nCorp. v. Cuno, 547 U. S. 332, 341 (2006). That limitation\nrequires those who invoke the power of a federal court to\ndemonstrate standing\u2014a \u201cpersonal injury fairly traceable\nto the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to\nbe redressed by the requested relief.\u201d Allen v.

NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cactual controversy\u201d must exist not only \u201cat the time the\ncomplaint is filed,\u201d but through \u201call stages\u201d of the litiga-\ntion. Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U. S. 87, 92 (2009) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); Arizonans for Official English\nv. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67 (1997) (\u201cTo qualify as a case\nfit for federal-court adjudication, \u2018an actual controversy\nmust be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the\ntime the complaint is filed\u2019\u201d (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422\nU. S. 395, 401 (1975))).\n   A case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer a \u201cCase\u201d\nor \u201cControversy\u201d for purposes of Article III\u2014\u201cwhen the\nissues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack\na legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d Murphy v.\nHunt, 455 U. S. 478, 481 (1982) (per curiam) (some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). No matter how vehe-\nmently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the\nconduct that precipitated the lawsuit, the case is moot if\nthe dispute \u201cis no longer embedded in any actual contro-\nversy about the plaintiffs\u2019 particular legal rights.\u201d Alva-\nrez, supra, at 93.\n   We have recognized, however, that a defendant cannot\nautomatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful\nconduct once sued. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle,\nInc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). Otherwise, a defendant\ncould engage in unlawful conduct, stop when sued to have\nthe case declared moot, then pick up where he left off,\nrepeating this cycle until he achieves all his unlawful\nends. Given this concern, our cases have explained that\n\u201ca defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots\na case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is\nabsolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not\nreasonably be expected to recur.\u201d Friends of the Earth,\nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528\nU. S. 167, 190 (2000).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n  At the outset of this litigation, both parties had standing\nto pursue their competing claims in court. Nike had\nstanding to sue because Already\u2019s activity was allegedly\ninfringing its rights under trademark law. Already had\nstanding to file its counterclaim because Nike was alleg-\nedly pressing an invalid trademark to halt Already\u2019s le-\ngitimate business activity. See MedImmune, supra, at\n126\u2013137 (a genuine threat of enforcement of intellectual prop-\nerty rights that inhibits commercial activity may support\nstanding). But then Nike dismissed its claims with preju-\ndice and issued its covenant, calling into question the\nexistence of any continuing case or controversy.\n  Under our precedents, it was Nike\u2019s burden to show\nthat it \u201ccould not reasonably be expected\u201d to resume its\nenforcement efforts against Already. Friends of the Earth,\nsupra, at 190. Nike makes a halfhearted effort to avoid\nthis test. Relying on Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193\n(1988), it argues that \u201cwhen a defendant makes a judicially\nenforceable commitment to avoid the conduct that forms\nthe basis for an Article III controversy, there is no reason\nto apply a special rule premised on the defendant\u2019s unfet-\ntered ability to \u2018return to [its] old ways.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Re-\nspondent 42.\n  Nike\u2019s reliance on Deakins is misplaced. In Deakins, the\nCourt did not disavow the voluntary cessation doctrine;\nthe Court employed precisely the analysis required by that\ntest. It found the case was moot because the challenged\naction\u2014pursuing a claim in court\u2014could not be resumed\nin \u201cthis or any subsequent action\u201d and because it was\nentirely \u201cspeculative\u201d that any similar claim would arise\nin the future. 484 U. S., at 201, n. 4 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It distinguished that situation from one\nin which a defendant is \u201cfree to return to his old ways.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). That is the\nquestion the voluntary cessation doctrine poses: Could the\n6                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallegedly wrongful behavior reasonably be expected to re-\ncur? Nike cannot avoid its \u201cformidable burden\u201d by as-\nsuming the answer to that question. Friends of the Earth,\nsupra, at 190.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   Having determined that the voluntary cessation doc-\ntrine applies, we begin our analysis with the terms of the\ncovenant:\n    \u201c[Nike] unconditionally and irrevocably covenants to\n    refrain from making any claim(s) or demand(s) . . .\n    against Already or any of its . . . related business enti-\n    ties . . . [including] distributors . . . and employees of\n    such entities and all customers . . . on account of any\n    possible cause of action based on or involving trade-\n    mark infringement, unfair competition, or dilution,\n    under state or federal law . . . relating to the NIKE\n    Mark based on the appearance of any of Already\u2019s cur-\n    rent and/or previous footwear product designs, and any\n    colorable imitations thereof, regardless of whether\n    that footwear is produced . . . or otherwise used in\n    commerce before or after the Effective Date of this\n    Covenant.\u201d App. 96a\u201397a (emphasis added).\n  The breadth of this covenant suffices to meet the burden\nimposed by the voluntary cessation test. The covenant is\nunconditional and irrevocable. Beyond simply prohibiting\nNike from filing suit, it prohibits Nike from making any\nclaim or any demand. It reaches beyond Already to pro-\ntect Already\u2019s distributors and customers. And it covers\nnot just current or previous designs, but any colorable\nimitations.\n  In addition, Nike originally argued that the Sugars and\nSoulja Boys infringed its trademark; in other words, Nike\nbelieved those shoes were \u201ccolorable imitations\u201d of the Air\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

We agree\nwith the Court of Appeals that \u201cit is hard to imagine a\nscenario that would potentially infringe [Nike\u2019s trade-\nmark] and yet not fall under the Covenant.\u201d* 663 F. 3d, at\n97. Nike, having taken the position in court that there\nis no prospect of such a shoe, would be hard pressed to as-\nsert the contrary down the road. See New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[W]here a party as-\nsumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and suc-\nceeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter,\nsimply because his interests have changed, assume a\ncontrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the\nparty who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken\nby him\u2019 \u201d (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 680, 689\n(1895))). If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed\nto it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it,\nand we cannot conceive of it. It sits, as far as we can tell,\non a shelf between Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers and Perseus\u2019s\nwinged sandals.\n   Given Nike\u2019s demonstration that the covenant encom-\npasses all of its allegedly unlawful conduct, it was incum-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Nike has \u201cacknowledged that if [Already] were to manufacture an\nexact copy of the Air Force 1 shoe . . . Nike could claim that the Cov-\nenant permits an infringement suit on the ground that a counterfeit\ndiffers from a colorable imitation under the Lanham Act.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at\n97, n. 5. Already, however, has never asserted any intent to make\ncounterfeit Air Force 1s. Ibid. Moreover, because a counterfeit would\npresumably include Nike\u2019s swoosh, an independently registered trade-\nmark not at issue here, invalidating the Air Force 1 trademark may\nnot be sufficient to allow Already to proceed to make counterfeits. See\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71127 (defining a counterfeit as a \u201cspurious mark which is\nidentical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered\nmark\u201d).\n8                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has suffi-\nciently concrete plans to engage in activities not covered\nby the covenant. After all, information about Already\u2019s\nbusiness activities and plans is uniquely within its posses-\nsion. The case is moot if the court, considering the cove-\nnant\u2019s language and the plaintiff \u2019s anticipated future\nactivities, is satisfied that it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that the\nallegedly unlawful activity cannot reasonably be expected\nto recur.\n   But when given the opportunity before the District\nCourt, Already did not assert any intent to design or\nmarket a shoe that would expose it to any prospect of in-\nfringement liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (find-\ning that there was \u201cno indication\u201d of any such intent);\n663 F. 3d, at 97, n. 5 (noting the \u201cabsence of record evi-\ndence that [Already] intends to make any arguably in-\nfringing shoe that is not unambiguously covered by the\nCovenant\u201d). The only affidavit it submitted to the District\nCourt on that question was from its president, saying little\nmore than that Already currently has plans to introduce\nnew shoe lines and make modifications to existing shoe\nlines. It never stated that these shoes would arguably\ninfringe Nike\u2019s trademark yet fall outside the scope of the\ncovenant. Nor did it do so on appeal to the Second Circuit.\nAnd again, it failed to do so here, even when counsel for\nAlready was asked at oral argument whether his client\nhad any intention to design or market a shoe that would\neven arguably fall outside the covenant. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n6\u20138. Given the covenant\u2019s broad language, and given that\nAlready has asserted no concrete plans to engage in con-\nduct not covered by the covenant, we can conclude the case\nis moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably\nbe expected to recur.\n   The authorities on which Already relies are not on point.\nIn Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., we affirmed\nthe unremarkable proposition that a court\u2019s \u201cdecision to\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrely on one of two possible alternative grounds (nonin-\nfringement rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power\nto decide the second question, particularly when its decree\nwas subject to review by this Court.\u201d 508 U. S. 83, 98\n(1993). In essence, when a court has jurisdiction to review\na case, and decides the issue on two independent grounds,\nthe first half of its opinion does not moot the second half,\nor vice versa. Here the issue is whether the District Court\nhad jurisdiction to consider the claim in the first place.\n   This case is also unlike Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U. S.\n359 (1943). There, patent holders brought suit against\nlicensees for specific performance of a license. The licen-\nsees counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe patents were invalid. The Court of Appeals, after\nfinding that the license was no longer in force and the\ndevices at issue did not infringe, dismissed the licensees\u2019\ncounterclaim as moot. We reversed, finding the contro-\nversy still live because the licensees continued to \u201cmanu-\nfactur[e] and sell[ ] additional articles claimed to fall under\nthe patents,\u201d and the patent holders continued to \u201cde-\nmand[ ] . . . royalties\u201d for those products. Id., at 364\u2013365.\nHere of course the whole point is that Already is free to\nsell its shoes without any fear of a trademark claim.\n                              B\n  Already argues, however, that there are alternative\ntheories of Article III injuries that save the case from\nmootness. First, it argues that so long as Nike remains\nfree to assert its trademark, investors will be apprehen-\nsive about investing in Already. Second, it argues that\ngiven Nike\u2019s decision to sue in the first place, Nike\u2019s\ntrademarks will now hang over Already\u2019s operations like a\nDamoclean sword. Finally, and relatedly, Already argues\nthat, as one of Nike\u2019s competitors, it inherently has stand-\ning to challenge Nike\u2019s intellectual property.\n  The problem for Already is that none of these injuries\n10               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuffices to support Article III standing. Although the\nvoluntary cessation standard requires the defendant to\nshow that the challenged behavior cannot reasonably be\nexpected to recur, we have never held that the doctrine\u2014\nby imposing this burden on the defendant\u2014allows the\nplaintiff to rely on theories of Article III injury that would\nfail to establish standing in the first place.\n   We begin with Already\u2019s argument that Nike\u2019s trade-\nmark registration \u201cgives false color to state and federal\ntrademark claims which expose [Already\u2019s] business to\nsubstantial and unpredictable risks,\u201d deterring investors.\nBrief for Petitioner 31. To demonstrate this, Already\npresented affidavits from potential investors stating that\nNike\u2019s lawsuit dissuaded them from investing in Already\nor prompted them to withdraw prior investments, and\nthat they would \u201cconsider\u201d investing in Already only if\nNike\u2019s trademark were struck down. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a. Already argues that like the plaintiffs in Village\nof Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926)\u2014\nwho had standing to challenge an ordinance because it re-\nduced their property value\u2014Already should have standing to\nchallenge the trademark because its mere existence ham-\npers its ability to attract capital.\n   But once it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that challenged conduct\ncannot \u201creasonably be expected to recur,\u201d Friends of the\nEarth, 528 U. S., at 190, the fact that some individuals\nmay base decisions on \u201cconjectural or hypothetical\u201d specu-\nlation does not give rise to the sort of \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cac-\ntual\u201d injury necessary to establish Article III standing,\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Euclid, we rea-\nsoned that, assuming the merits of plaintiff \u2019s claim, \u201cthe\nordinance, in effect, constitutes a present invasion of\n[plaintiff \u2019s] property rights.\u201d 272 U. S., at 386. Here\nthere is no such present invasion; in fact there is a cove-\nnant promising no invasion. In addition, unlike the plain-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiffs in Euclid, Already does not claim that Nike\u2019s Air\nForce 1 infringes any of its property rights.\n   Already has also pointed to an affidavit from a vice\npresident stating that Nike has \u201csuggested\u201d to Already\u2019s\nretailers that they refrain from carrying Already\u2019s shoes,\nlest \u201cNike . . . cancel its account or take other actions\nagainst the retailer, e.g., delay shipment of the retailer\u2019s\nNike order or \u2018lose\u2019 the retailer\u2019s Nike order.\u201d App. 177a.\nEven if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based\non a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will\ntake action against the plaintiff \u2019s retailers, the covenant\nhere extends protection to Already\u2019s distributors and\ncustomers. And even if Nike were engaging in harass-\nment or unfair trade practices, Already has not explained\nhow invalidating Nike\u2019s trademark would do anything to\nstop it.\n   Already also complains that it can no longer \u201cjust blithely\ngo about its shoe business as if there were no risk of\nbeing sued again.\u201d Reply Brief 14. As counsel told us at\noral argument: \u201conce bitten, twice shy.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\nBut we have never held that a plaintiff has standing to\npursue declaratory relief merely on the basis of being\n\u201conce bitten.\u201d Quite the opposite. See, e.g., Los Angeles v.\nLyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (holding there is no justici-\nable controversy where plaintiff had once been subjected\nto a chokehold). Given our conclusion that Nike has met\nits burden of demonstrating there is no reasonable risk\nthat Already will be sued again, there is no reason for\nAlready to be so shy. It is the only one of Nike\u2019s competi-\ntors with a judicially enforceable covenant protecting it\nfrom litigation relating to the Air Force 1 trademark.\nInsofar as the injury is a threat of Air Force 1 trademark\nlitigation, Already is Nike\u2019s least injured competitor.\n   Already falls back on a sweeping argument: In the\ncontext of registered trademarks, \u201c[n]o covenant, no mat-\nter how broad, can eradicate the effects\u201d of a registered\n12               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut invalid trademark. Brief for Petitioner 33\u201334. Ac-\ncording to Already, allowing Nike to unilaterally moot the\ncase \u201csubverts\u201d the important role federal courts play in\nthe administration of federal patent and trademark law.\nId., at 40. It allows companies like Nike to register and\nbrandish invalid trademarks to intimidate smaller com-\npetitors, avoiding judicial review by issuing covenants in\nthe rare case where the little guy fights back. Already and\nits amici thus contend that Already, \u201c[a]s a company\nengaged in the business of designing and marketing ath-\nletic shoes,\u201d has standing to challenge Nike\u2019s trademark.\nSee id., at 21; see also Brief for Intellectual Property Pro-\nfessors as Amici Curiae 3 (suggesting that standing ex-\ntends to all \u201cparticipants in that field\u201d); Brief for Public\nPatent Foundation as Amici Curiae 12 (\u201c[T]he public has\nstanding to challenge the validity of any issued patent or\nregistered trademark in court\u201d).\n   Under this approach, Nike need not even have threat-\nened to sue first. Already, even with no plans to make\nanything resembling the Air Force 1, could sue to invali-\ndate the trademark simply because Already and Nike both\ncompete in the athletic footwear market. Taken to its\nlogical conclusion, the theory seems to be that a market\nparticipant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a\ncompetitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\u2014\nwhether a trademark, the awarding of a contract, a landlord-\ntenant arrangement, or so on. We have never accepted\nsuch a boundless theory of standing. The cases Already\ncites for this remarkable proposition stand for no such\nthing. In each of those cases, standing was based on\nan injury more particularized and more concrete than\nthe mere assertion that something unlawful benefited the\nplaintiff \u2019s competitor. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S.\n656 (1993); Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, 416\nU.

This\nconcern cannot compel us to adopt Already\u2019s broad theory\nof standing.\n   First of all, granting covenants not to sue may be a\nrisky long-term strategy for a trademark holder. See, e.g.,\n3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks & Unfair Competition\n\u00a718:48, p. 18\u2013112 (4th ed. 2012) (\u201c[U]ncontrolled and \u2018naked\u2019\nlicensing can result in such a loss of significance of a\ntrademark that a federal registration should be can-\ncelled\u201d); Sun Banks of Fla., Inc. v. Sun Fed. Sav. & Loan\nAssn., 651 F. 2d 311, 316 (CA5 1981) (finding that \u201cexten-\nsive third-party use of the [mark was] impressive evidence\nthat there would be no likelihood of confusion\u201d). In addi-\ntion, the Lanham Act provides some check on abusive\nlitigation practices by providing for an award of attorney\u2019s\nfees in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71117(a); cf., e.g.,\nGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Founda-\ntion, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 67, n. 6 (1987) (explaining that an\naward of litigation costs can protect \u201cfrom the suddenly\nrepentant defendant\u201d).\n   Accepting Already\u2019s theory may benefit the small com-\npetitor in this case. But lowering the gates for one party\nlowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with\nmore resources will have standing to challenge the intel-\nlectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals\u2014\nnot because they are threatened by any particular patent\nor trademark, but simply because they are competitors in\nthe same market. This would further encourage parties to\nemploy litigation as a weapon against their competitors\nrather than as a last resort for settling disputes.\n   Already\u2019s only legally cognizable injury\u2014the fact that\nNike took steps to enforce its trademark\u2014is now gone\nand, given the breadth of the covenant, cannot reasonably\nbe expected to recur. There being no other basis on which\n14               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto find a live controversy, the case is clearly moot.\n                              V\n   The Solicitor General asks us to \u201cremand the case for\nfurther proceedings in which the parties can develop the\nrecord on both the scope of the covenant and petitioner\u2019s\nbusiness activities, and the courts below can apply the\nproper standard to the record.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 28.\n   Such a remand would serve no purpose. The scope of\nthe covenant is clear. Already\u2019s argument is not that the\ncovenant could be drafted more broadly, but instead that\nno covenant would ever do. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313.\n   As for business activities, it is plain that Already has\nsaid all it has to say. The District Court held a hearing\non whether the case was mooted by the covenant. There,\nand at every stage of the proceedings thereafter, Already\nsteadfastly refused to suggest that it has any plans to\ncreate any arguably infringing shoe that does not unam-\nbiguously fall within the scope of the covenant\u2014this de-\nspite every incentive, opportunity, and invitation to do so.\nAs noted, the District Court expressly found \u201cno indica-\ntion\u201d that Already had any such plans, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 31a, and Already never challenged this finding. It\ndid not challenge that finding on appeal to the Second\nCircuit, even though its significance was clear. The Court\nof Appeals expressly found that Already \u201chas not asserted\nany intention to market any such shoe.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 97.\nAlready declined to challenge these conclusions before us,\ndespite questions from the bench addressing that particu-\nlar issue. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u20138.\n   The courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary\ncessation standard, as articulated in our cases. But the\nanalysis in their opinions addressed the same questions\nwe have addressed today under that standard. In deter-\nmining the case was moot, they relied, as we have, on the\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

The Dis-\ntrict Court explained that \u201c[w]hether a covenant not to sue\nwill divest the trial court of jurisdiction depends on what\nis covered by the covenant.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It read the covenant\n\u201cbroadly,\u201d id., at 34a, and found \u201cno indication that any of\n[Already\u2019s] forthcoming models would extend beyond this\nbroad language,\u201d id., at 31a. It even concluded that from\nAlready\u2019s perspective, there was \u201clittle difference\u201d between\ninvalidating the trademark and the scope of protection al-\nready afforded by the covenant. Id., at 34a.\n   Likewise, the Court of Appeals asked \u201cwhether the\ncovenant covers future, as well as past, activity and prod-\nucts,\u201d and inquired into \u201cevidence of intention or lack of\nintention, on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction,\nto engage in new activity or to develop new potentially\ninfringing products that arguably are not covered by the\ncovenant.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 96. It concluded that \u201c[t]he\nbreadth of the Covenant renders the threat of litigation\nremote or nonexistent\u201d because it could not envision a\nshoe that would be within Nike\u2019s trademark yet not pro-\ntected by the covenant, noting that Already \u201chas not as-\nserted any intention to market any such shoe.\u201d Id., at 97.\n   Under such circumstances, a remand would serve no\npurpose.

The burden was not on Already to show\nthat a justiciable controversy remains. Under the volun-\ntary cessation doctrine, Nike bears the \u201cformidable burden\nof showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrong-\nful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Ser-\nvices (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 190 (2000). In the cir-\ncumstances here, then, Nike must demonstrate that the\ncovenant not to sue is of sufficient breadth and force that\nAlready can have no reasonable anticipation of a future\ntrademark infringement claim from Nike.\n  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals issued\ntheir rulings on the erroneous premise that it was for\nAlready to make the relevant showing. When a court has\nimposed the burden to establish a certain proposition on\nthe wrong party, remand from a reviewing court is often\nappropriate to determine whether the outcome would have\nbeen different had the proper rule been applied. Here,\nhowever, the Court concludes the case must be deemed\nmoot in all events, based on the terms and scope of the\n2                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ncovenant and on Already\u2019s seeming insistence that no\nmatter how it might be worded, a covenant drawn by the\ntrademark holder cannot moot the case. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 33\u201334; Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\u201313. For reasons the\nCourt states, this goes too far. Already appears also to dis-\nclaim any need to determine whether there is a real like-\nlihood it will produce a new product that, first, is not a\ncolorable imitation of its existing product line, and, sec-\nond, might be thought to infringe Nike\u2019s trademark.\n   This brief, separate concurrence is written to underscore\nthat covenants like the one Nike filed here ought not to\nbe taken as an automatic means for the party who first\ncharged a competitor with trademark infringement sud-\ndenly to abandon the suit without incurring the risk of\nan ensuing adverse adjudication. Courts should be well\naware that charges of trademark infringement can be\ndisruptive to the good business relations between the\nmanufacturer alleged to have been an infringer and its dis-\ntributors, retailers, and investors. The mere pendency of\nlitigation can mean that other actors in the marketplace\nmay be reluctant to have future dealings with the alleged\ninfringer. Nike appears to have been well aware of that\ndynamic in this case. In referring to Already it stated at\none point: \u201c[O]ver the past eight months, Nike has cleared\nout the worst offending infringers. Now Already remains\nas one of the last few companies that was identified on\nthat top ten list of infringers.\u201d App. 114a.\n   Any demonstrated reluctance by investors, distributors,\nand retailers to maintain good relations with the alleged\ninfringer might, in an appropriate case, be an indication\nthat the market itself anticipates that a new line of prod-\nucts could be outside the covenant not to sue yet still\nwithin a zone of alleged infringement. And, as noted at\nthe outset, it is the trademark holder who has the burden\nto show that this is not the case. It is not the burden of\nthe alleged infringer to prove that the covenant not to sue\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nis inadequate to protect its current and future products\nfrom a trademark enforcement action.\n   In later cases careful consideration must be given to the\nconsequences of using a covenant not to sue as the basis\nfor a motion to dismiss as moot. If the holder of an alleged\ntrademark can commence suit against a competitor; in\nmidcourse file a covenant not to sue; and then require\nthe competitor and its business network to engage in costly,\nsatellite proceedings to demonstrate that future produc-\ntion or sales might still be compromised, it would seem\nthat the trademark holder\u2019s burden to show the case is\nmoot may fall well short of being formidable. The very\nsuit the trademark holder initiated and later seeks to de-\nclare moot may still cause disruption and costs to the\ncompetition. The formidable burden to show the case is\nmoot ought to require the trademark holder, at the outset,\nto make a substantial showing that the business of the\ncompetitor and its supply network will not be disrupted or\nweakened by satellite litigation over mootness or by any\nthreat latent in the terms of the covenant itself. It would\nbe most unfair to allow the party who commences the suit\nto use its delivery of a covenant not to sue as an op-\nportunity to force a competitor to expose its future business\nplans or to otherwise disadvantage the competitor and its\nbusiness network, all in aid of deeming moot a suit the\ntrademark holder itself chose to initiate.\n   There are relatively few cases that have discussed the\nmeaning and effect of covenants not to sue in the context\nof ongoing litigation.

Argued November 7, 2012\u2014Decided January 9, 2013\nNike filed this suit, alleging that two of Already\u2019s athletic shoes violat-\n  ed Nike\u2019s Air Force 1 trademark. Already denied the allegations and\n  filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nike\u2019s Air Force 1\n  trademark. While the suit was pending, Nike issued a \u201cCovenant\n  Not to Sue,\u201d promising not to raise any trademark or unfair competi-\n  tion claims against Already or any affiliated entity based on Al-\n  ready\u2019s existing footwear designs, or any future Already designs that\n  constituted a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of Already\u2019s current products.\n  Nike then moved to dismiss its claims with prejudice, and to dismiss\n  Already\u2019s counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the cov-\n  enant had extinguished the case or controversy. Already opposed\n  dismissal of its counterclaim, contending that Nike had not estab-\n  lished that its covenant had mooted the case. In support, Already\n  presented an affidavit from its president, stating that Already\n  planned to introduce new versions of its lines into the market; affida-\n  vits from three potential investors, asserting that they would not\n  consider investing in Already until Nike\u2019s trademark was invalidat-\n  ed; and an affidavit from an Already executive, stating that Nike had\n  intimidated retailers into refusing to carry Already\u2019s shoes. The Dis-\n  trict Court dismissed Already\u2019s counterclaim, concluding that there\n  was no longer a justiciable controversy. The Second Circuit affirmed.\n  It explained that the covenant was broadly drafted; that the court\n  could not conceive of a shoe that would infringe Nike\u2019s trademark yet\n  not fall within the covenant; and that Already had not asserted any\n  intent to market such a shoe.\nHeld: This case is moot. Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) A case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer a \u201cCase\u201d or \u201cCon-\n troversy\u201d for Article III purposes\u2014\u201cwhen the issues presented are no\n2                     ALREADY, LLC v.

S. 478, 481. A defendant cannot,\n    however, automatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful\n    conduct once sued. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., 455\n    U. S. 283, 289. Instead, \u201ca defendant claiming that its voluntary\n    compliance moots a case bears the formidable burden of showing that\n    it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not rea-\n    sonably be expected to recur.\u201d Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\n    Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 190. Pp. 3\u20134.\n       (b) Nike has the burden to show that it \u201ccould not reasonably be\n    expected\u201d to resume its enforcement efforts against Already. The\n    voluntary cessation doctrine was not disavowed in Deakins v. Mona-\n    ghan, 484 U. S. 193. There, the Court employed precisely the analy-\n    sis the test requires, finding a case moot because the challenged ac-\n    tion\u2014pursuing a claim in court\u2014could not be resumed in \u201cthis or any\n    subsequent action\u201d and because it was entirely \u201c \u2018speculative\u2019 \u201d that\n    any similar claim would arise in the future. Id., at 201, n. 4. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (c) Application of the voluntary cessation doctrine shows that this\n    case is moot. Pp. 6\u201314.\n          (1) The breadth of the covenant suffices to meet the burden im-\n    posed by the doctrine. The covenant is unconditional and irrevocable.\n    It prohibits Nike from filing suit or making any claim or demand;\n    protects both Already and Already\u2019s distributors and customers; and\n    covers not just current or previous designs, but also colorable imita-\n    tions. Once Nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of\n    Already\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct, it became incumbent on Al-\n    ready to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans\n    to engage in activities that would arguably infringe Nike\u2019s trademark\n    yet not be covered by the covenant. But Already failed to do so in the\n    courts below or in this Court. The case is thus moot because the chal-\n    lenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur. Cardinal\n    Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., 508 U. S. 83, and Altvater v. Free-\n    man, 319 U. S. 359, distinguished. Pp. 6\u20139.\n          (2) Already\u2019s alternative theories of Article III injuries do not\n    save the case from mootness, because none of those injuries suffices\n    to support Article III standing in the first place. Already argues that\n    as long as Nike is free to assert its trademark, investors will hesitate\n    to invest in Already. But once it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that challenged\n    conduct cannot \u201creasonably be expected to recur,\u201d Friends of the\n    Earth, supra, at 190, the fact that some individuals may base deci-\n    sions on conjectural or hypothetical speculation does not give rise to\n    the sort of concrete and actual injury necessary to establish Article\n    III standing, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560. Al-\n    ready worries about its retailers, but even if a plaintiff may bring an\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  invalidity claim based on a reasonable expectation that a trademark\n  holder will take action against the plaintiff \u2019s retailers, the covenant\n  here extends protection to Already\u2019s distributors and customers. Al-\n  ready also complains that Nike\u2019s decision to sue in the first place has\n  led Already to fear another suit. But, since Nike has met its burden\n  to demonstrate that there is no reasonable risk of such a suit, this\n  concern is unfounded. Already falls back on the sweeping argument\n  that, as one of Nike\u2019s competitors, it inherently has standing because\n  no covenant can eradicate the effects of a registered but invalid\n  trademark. The logical conclusion of this theory seems to be that a\n  market participant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a\n  competitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\u2014e.g., a\n  trademark or the awarding of a contract\u2014but this Court has never\n  accepted such a boundless theory of standing.\n     Already\u2019s policy objection that dismissing this case allows Nike to\n  bully small innovators does not support adoption of this broad theory.\n  Granting covenants not to sue may be a risky long-term strategy for a\n  trademark holder. And while accepting Already\u2019s theory may benefit\n  the small competitor in this case, it also lowers the gates for larger\n  companies with more resources, who may challenge the intellectual\n  property portfolios of more humble rivals simply because they are\n  competitors in the same market. This would further encourage par-\n  ties to employ litigation as a weapon against their competitors rather\n  than as a last resort for settling disputes. Pp. 9\u201314.\n     (d) No purpose would be served by remanding the case. Already\n  has had every opportunity and incentive to submit evidence in the\n  proceedings below. It has refused, at every stage of the proceedings,\n  to suggest that it has any plans to design a shoe that violates the Air\n  Force 1 trademark yet falls outside the covenant. And while the\n  courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary cessation stand-\n  ard, their analysis addressed the same questions this Court address-\n  es here under that standard.

Petitioner Already also designs and markets\nathletic footwear, including shoe lines known as \u201cSugars\u201d\nand \u201cSoulja Boys.\u201d Nike, alleging that the Soulja Boys in-\nfringed and diluted the Air Force 1 trademark, demanded\nthat Already cease and desist its sale of those shoes.\nWhen Already refused, Nike filed suit in federal court\nalleging that the Soulja Boys as well as the Sugars in-\nfringed and diluted its Air Force 1 trademark. Already\ndenied these allegations and filed a counterclaim contend-\ning that the Air Force 1 trademark is invalid.\n   In March 2010, eight months after Nike filed its com-\nplaint, and four months after Already counterclaimed,\n2               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nNike issued a \u201cCovenant Not to Sue.\u201d Its preamble stated\nthat \u201cAlready\u2019s actions . . . no longer infringe or dilute\nthe NIKE Mark at a level sufficient to warrant the substan-\ntial time and expense of continued litigation.\u201d App. 96a.\nThe covenant promised that Nike would not raise against\nAlready or any affiliated entity any trademark or unfair\ncompetition claim based on any of Already\u2019s existing foot-\nwear designs, or any future Already designs that consti-\ntuted a \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of Already\u2019s current products.\nId., at 96a\u201397a.\n   After issuing this covenant, Nike moved to dismiss its\nclaims with prejudice, and to dismiss Already\u2019s invalid-\nity counterclaim without prejudice on the ground that the\ncovenant had extinguished the case or controversy. Al-\nready opposed dismissal of its counterclaim, arguing that\nNike had not established that its voluntary cessation had\nmooted the case. In support, Already presented an affi-\ndavit from its president, stating that Already had plans to\nintroduce new versions of its shoe lines into the market;\naffidavits from three potential investors, asserting that\nthey would not consider investing in Already until Nike\u2019s\ntrademark was invalidated; and an affidavit from one of\nAlready\u2019s executives, stating that Nike had intimidated\nretailers into refusing to carry Already\u2019s shoes.\n   The District Court dismissed Already\u2019s counterclaim,\nstating that because Already sought \u201cto invoke the Court\u2019s\ndeclaratory judgment jurisdiction, it bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that the Court has subject matter jurisdic-\ntion over its counterclaim[ ].\u201d Civ. No. 09\u20136366 (SDNY,\nJan. 20, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a. The Court\nread the covenant \u201cbroad[ly],\u201d concluding that \u201cany of [Al-\nready\u2019s] future products that arguably infringed the Nike\nMark would be \u2018colorable imitations\u2019 \u201d of Already\u2019s current\nfootwear and therefore protected by the covenant. Id., at\n29a, n. 2. Finding no evidence that Already sought to\ndevelop any shoes not covered by the covenant, the Court\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nheld there was no longer \u201ca substantial controversy . . . of\nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance\nof a declaratory judgment.\u201d Id., at 34a (quoting Med-\nImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 127 (2007)\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   The Second Circuit affirmed. It held that in determin-\ning whether a covenant not to sue \u201celiminates a justiciable\ncase or controversy,\u201d courts should look to the totality\nof the circumstances, including \u201c(1) the language of the\ncovenant, (2) whether the covenant covers future, as well\nas past, activity and products, and (3) evidence of inten-\ntion . . . on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction\u201d to\nengage in conduct not covered by the covenant. 663 F. 3d\n89, 96 (2011) (footnote omitted). Noting that the covenant\ncovers \u201cboth past sales and future sales of both existing\nproducts and colorable imitations,\u201d the Second Circuit\nfound it hard to conceive of a shoe that would infringe the\nAir Force 1 trademark yet not fall within the covenant.\nId., at 97. Given that Already \u201cha[d] not asserted any\nintention to market any such shoe,\u201d the court concluded\nthat Already could not show any continuing injury, and\nthat therefore no justiciable controversy remained. Ibid.\nWe granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Article III of the Constitution grants the Judicial\nBranch authority to adjudicate \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControver-\nsies.\u201d In our system of government, courts have \u201cno busi-\nness\u201d deciding legal disputes or expounding on law in the\nabsence of such a case or controversy.

S. 478, 481 (1982) (per curiam) (some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). No matter how vehe-\nmently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the\nconduct that precipitated the lawsuit, the case is moot if\nthe dispute \u201cis no longer embedded in any actual contro-\nversy about the plaintiffs\u2019 particular legal rights.\u201d Alva-\nrez, supra, at 93.\n   We have recognized, however, that a defendant cannot\nautomatically moot a case simply by ending its unlawful\nconduct once sued. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin\u2019s Castle,\nInc., 455 U. S. 283, 289 (1982). Otherwise, a defendant\ncould engage in unlawful conduct, stop when sued to have\nthe case declared moot, then pick up where he left off,\nrepeating this cycle until he achieves all his unlawful\nends. Given this concern, our cases have explained that\n\u201ca defendant claiming that its voluntary compliance moots\na case bears the formidable burden of showing that it is\nabsolutely clear the allegedly wrongful behavior could not\nreasonably be expected to recur.\u201d Friends of the Earth,\nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528\nU. S. 167, 190 (2000).\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Nike had\nstanding to sue because Already\u2019s activity was allegedly\ninfringing its rights under trademark law. Already had\nstanding to file its counterclaim because Nike was alleg-\nedly pressing an invalid trademark to halt Already\u2019s le-\ngitimate business activity. See MedImmune, supra, at\n126\u2013137 (a genuine threat of enforcement of intellectual prop-\nerty rights that inhibits commercial activity may support\nstanding). But then Nike dismissed its claims with preju-\ndice and issued its covenant, calling into question the\nexistence of any continuing case or controversy.\n  Under our precedents, it was Nike\u2019s burden to show\nthat it \u201ccould not reasonably be expected\u201d to resume its\nenforcement efforts against Already. Friends of the Earth,\nsupra, at 190. Nike makes a halfhearted effort to avoid\nthis test. Relying on Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193\n(1988), it argues that \u201cwhen a defendant makes a judicially\nenforceable commitment to avoid the conduct that forms\nthe basis for an Article III controversy, there is no reason\nto apply a special rule premised on the defendant\u2019s unfet-\ntered ability to \u2018return to [its] old ways.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Re-\nspondent 42.\n  Nike\u2019s reliance on Deakins is misplaced. In Deakins, the\nCourt did not disavow the voluntary cessation doctrine;\nthe Court employed precisely the analysis required by that\ntest. It found the case was moot because the challenged\naction\u2014pursuing a claim in court\u2014could not be resumed\nin \u201cthis or any subsequent action\u201d and because it was\nentirely \u201cspeculative\u201d that any similar claim would arise\nin the future. 484 U. S., at 201, n. 4 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It distinguished that situation from one\nin which a defendant is \u201cfree to return to his old ways.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted). That is the\nquestion the voluntary cessation doctrine poses: Could the\n6                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nallegedly wrongful behavior reasonably be expected to re-\ncur? Nike cannot avoid its \u201cformidable burden\u201d by as-\nsuming the answer to that question. Friends of the Earth,\nsupra, at 190.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n   Having determined that the voluntary cessation doc-\ntrine applies, we begin our analysis with the terms of the\ncovenant:\n    \u201c[Nike] unconditionally and irrevocably covenants to\n    refrain from making any claim(s) or demand(s) . . .\n    against Already or any of its . . . related business enti-\n    ties . . . [including] distributors . . . and employees of\n    such entities and all customers . . . on account of any\n    possible cause of action based on or involving trade-\n    mark infringement, unfair competition, or dilution,\n    under state or federal law . . . relating to the NIKE\n    Mark based on the appearance of any of Already\u2019s cur-\n    rent and/or previous footwear product designs, and any\n    colorable imitations thereof, regardless of whether\n    that footwear is produced . . . or otherwise used in\n    commerce before or after the Effective Date of this\n    Covenant.\u201d App. 96a\u201397a (emphasis added).\n  The breadth of this covenant suffices to meet the burden\nimposed by the voluntary cessation test. The covenant is\nunconditional and irrevocable. Beyond simply prohibiting\nNike from filing suit, it prohibits Nike from making any\nclaim or any demand. It reaches beyond Already to pro-\ntect Already\u2019s distributors and customers. And it covers\nnot just current or previous designs, but any colorable\nimitations.\n  In addition, Nike originally argued that the Sugars and\nSoulja Boys infringed its trademark; in other words, Nike\nbelieved those shoes were \u201ccolorable imitations\u201d of the Air\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

Nike\u2019s cov-\nenant now allows Already to produce all of its existing\nfootwear designs\u2014including the Sugar and Soulja Boy\u2014\nand any \u201ccolorable imitation\u201d of those designs. We agree\nwith the Court of Appeals that \u201cit is hard to imagine a\nscenario that would potentially infringe [Nike\u2019s trade-\nmark] and yet not fall under the Covenant.\u201d* 663 F. 3d, at\n97. Nike, having taken the position in court that there\nis no prospect of such a shoe, would be hard pressed to as-\nsert the contrary down the road. See New Hampshire v.\nMaine, 532 U. S. 742, 749 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[W]here a party as-\nsumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and suc-\nceeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter,\nsimply because his interests have changed, assume a\ncontrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the\nparty who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken\nby him\u2019 \u201d (quoting Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U. S. 680, 689\n(1895))). If such a shoe exists, the parties have not pointed\nto it, there is no evidence that Already has dreamt of it,\nand we cannot conceive of it. It sits, as far as we can tell,\non a shelf between Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers and Perseus\u2019s\nwinged sandals.\n   Given Nike\u2019s demonstration that the covenant encom-\npasses all of its allegedly unlawful conduct, it was incum-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Nike has \u201cacknowledged that if [Already] were to manufacture an\nexact copy of the Air Force 1 shoe . . . Nike could claim that the Cov-\nenant permits an infringement suit on the ground that a counterfeit\ndiffers from a colorable imitation under the Lanham Act.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at\n97, n. 5. Already, however, has never asserted any intent to make\ncounterfeit Air Force 1s. Ibid. Moreover, because a counterfeit would\npresumably include Nike\u2019s swoosh, an independently registered trade-\nmark not at issue here, invalidating the Air Force 1 trademark may\nnot be sufficient to allow Already to proceed to make counterfeits. See\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71127 (defining a counterfeit as a \u201cspurious mark which is\nidentical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered\nmark\u201d).\n8                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has suffi-\nciently concrete plans to engage in activities not covered\nby the covenant. After all, information about Already\u2019s\nbusiness activities and plans is uniquely within its posses-\nsion. The case is moot if the court, considering the cove-\nnant\u2019s language and the plaintiff \u2019s anticipated future\nactivities, is satisfied that it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that the\nallegedly unlawful activity cannot reasonably be expected\nto recur.\n   But when given the opportunity before the District\nCourt, Already did not assert any intent to design or\nmarket a shoe that would expose it to any prospect of in-\nfringement liability. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (find-\ning that there was \u201cno indication\u201d of any such intent);\n663 F. 3d, at 97, n. 5 (noting the \u201cabsence of record evi-\ndence that [Already] intends to make any arguably in-\nfringing shoe that is not unambiguously covered by the\nCovenant\u201d). The only affidavit it submitted to the District\nCourt on that question was from its president, saying little\nmore than that Already currently has plans to introduce\nnew shoe lines and make modifications to existing shoe\nlines. It never stated that these shoes would arguably\ninfringe Nike\u2019s trademark yet fall outside the scope of the\ncovenant. Nor did it do so on appeal to the Second Circuit.\nAnd again, it failed to do so here, even when counsel for\nAlready was asked at oral argument whether his client\nhad any intention to design or market a shoe that would\neven arguably fall outside the covenant. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n6\u20138. Given the covenant\u2019s broad language, and given that\nAlready has asserted no concrete plans to engage in con-\nduct not covered by the covenant, we can conclude the case\nis moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably\nbe expected to recur.\n   The authorities on which Already relies are not on point.\nIn Cardinal Chemical Co. v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., we affirmed\nthe unremarkable proposition that a court\u2019s \u201cdecision to\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrely on one of two possible alternative grounds (nonin-\nfringement rather than invalidity) did not strip it of power\nto decide the second question, particularly when its decree\nwas subject to review by this Court.\u201d 508 U. S. 83, 98\n(1993). In essence, when a court has jurisdiction to review\na case, and decides the issue on two independent grounds,\nthe first half of its opinion does not moot the second half,\nor vice versa. Here the issue is whether the District Court\nhad jurisdiction to consider the claim in the first place.\n   This case is also unlike Altvater v. Freeman, 319 U. S.\n359 (1943). There, patent holders brought suit against\nlicensees for specific performance of a license. The licen-\nsees counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that\nthe patents were invalid. The Court of Appeals, after\nfinding that the license was no longer in force and the\ndevices at issue did not infringe, dismissed the licensees\u2019\ncounterclaim as moot. We reversed, finding the contro-\nversy still live because the licensees continued to \u201cmanu-\nfactur[e] and sell[ ] additional articles claimed to fall under\nthe patents,\u201d and the patent holders continued to \u201cde-\nmand[ ] . . . royalties\u201d for those products. Id., at 364\u2013365.\nHere of course the whole point is that Already is free to\nsell its shoes without any fear of a trademark claim.\n                              B\n  Already argues, however, that there are alternative\ntheories of Article III injuries that save the case from\nmootness. First, it argues that so long as Nike remains\nfree to assert its trademark, investors will be apprehen-\nsive about investing in Already. Second, it argues that\ngiven Nike\u2019s decision to sue in the first place, Nike\u2019s\ntrademarks will now hang over Already\u2019s operations like a\nDamoclean sword. Finally, and relatedly, Already argues\nthat, as one of Nike\u2019s competitors, it inherently has stand-\ning to challenge Nike\u2019s intellectual property.\n  The problem for Already is that none of these injuries\n10               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsuffices to support Article III standing. Although the\nvoluntary cessation standard requires the defendant to\nshow that the challenged behavior cannot reasonably be\nexpected to recur, we have never held that the doctrine\u2014\nby imposing this burden on the defendant\u2014allows the\nplaintiff to rely on theories of Article III injury that would\nfail to establish standing in the first place.\n   We begin with Already\u2019s argument that Nike\u2019s trade-\nmark registration \u201cgives false color to state and federal\ntrademark claims which expose [Already\u2019s] business to\nsubstantial and unpredictable risks,\u201d deterring investors.\nBrief for Petitioner 31. To demonstrate this, Already\npresented affidavits from potential investors stating that\nNike\u2019s lawsuit dissuaded them from investing in Already\nor prompted them to withdraw prior investments, and\nthat they would \u201cconsider\u201d investing in Already only if\nNike\u2019s trademark were struck down. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n33a. Already argues that like the plaintiffs in Village\nof Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926)\u2014\nwho had standing to challenge an ordinance because it re-\nduced their property value\u2014Already should have standing to\nchallenge the trademark because its mere existence ham-\npers its ability to attract capital.\n   But once it is \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that challenged conduct\ncannot \u201creasonably be expected to recur,\u201d Friends of the\nEarth, 528 U. S., at 190, the fact that some individuals\nmay base decisions on \u201cconjectural or hypothetical\u201d specu-\nlation does not give rise to the sort of \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cac-\ntual\u201d injury necessary to establish Article III standing,\nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Euclid, we rea-\nsoned that, assuming the merits of plaintiff \u2019s claim, \u201cthe\nordinance, in effect, constitutes a present invasion of\n[plaintiff \u2019s] property rights.\u201d 272 U.

S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntiffs in Euclid, Already does not claim that Nike\u2019s Air\nForce 1 infringes any of its property rights.\n   Already has also pointed to an affidavit from a vice\npresident stating that Nike has \u201csuggested\u201d to Already\u2019s\nretailers that they refrain from carrying Already\u2019s shoes,\nlest \u201cNike . . . cancel its account or take other actions\nagainst the retailer, e.g., delay shipment of the retailer\u2019s\nNike order or \u2018lose\u2019 the retailer\u2019s Nike order.\u201d App. 177a.\nEven if a plaintiff may bring an invalidity claim based\non a reasonable expectation that a trademark holder will\ntake action against the plaintiff \u2019s retailers, the covenant\nhere extends protection to Already\u2019s distributors and\ncustomers. And even if Nike were engaging in harass-\nment or unfair trade practices, Already has not explained\nhow invalidating Nike\u2019s trademark would do anything to\nstop it.\n   Already also complains that it can no longer \u201cjust blithely\ngo about its shoe business as if there were no risk of\nbeing sued again.\u201d Reply Brief 14. As counsel told us at\noral argument: \u201conce bitten, twice shy.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\nBut we have never held that a plaintiff has standing to\npursue declaratory relief merely on the basis of being\n\u201conce bitten.\u201d Quite the opposite. See, e.g., Los Angeles v.\nLyons, 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983) (holding there is no justici-\nable controversy where plaintiff had once been subjected\nto a chokehold). Given our conclusion that Nike has met\nits burden of demonstrating there is no reasonable risk\nthat Already will be sued again, there is no reason for\nAlready to be so shy. It is the only one of Nike\u2019s competi-\ntors with a judicially enforceable covenant protecting it\nfrom litigation relating to the Air Force 1 trademark.\nInsofar as the injury is a threat of Air Force 1 trademark\nlitigation, Already is Nike\u2019s least injured competitor.\n   Already falls back on a sweeping argument: In the\ncontext of registered trademarks, \u201c[n]o covenant, no mat-\nter how broad, can eradicate the effects\u201d of a registered\n12               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut invalid trademark. Brief for Petitioner 33\u201334. Ac-\ncording to Already, allowing Nike to unilaterally moot the\ncase \u201csubverts\u201d the important role federal courts play in\nthe administration of federal patent and trademark law.\nId., at 40. It allows companies like Nike to register and\nbrandish invalid trademarks to intimidate smaller com-\npetitors, avoiding judicial review by issuing covenants in\nthe rare case where the little guy fights back. Already and\nits amici thus contend that Already, \u201c[a]s a company\nengaged in the business of designing and marketing ath-\nletic shoes,\u201d has standing to challenge Nike\u2019s trademark.\nSee id., at 21; see also Brief for Intellectual Property Pro-\nfessors as Amici Curiae 3 (suggesting that standing ex-\ntends to all \u201cparticipants in that field\u201d); Brief for Public\nPatent Foundation as Amici Curiae 12 (\u201c[T]he public has\nstanding to challenge the validity of any issued patent or\nregistered trademark in court\u201d).\n   Under this approach, Nike need not even have threat-\nened to sue first. Already, even with no plans to make\nanything resembling the Air Force 1, could sue to invali-\ndate the trademark simply because Already and Nike both\ncompete in the athletic footwear market. Taken to its\nlogical conclusion, the theory seems to be that a market\nparticipant is injured for Article III purposes whenever a\ncompetitor benefits from something allegedly unlawful\u2014\nwhether a trademark, the awarding of a contract, a landlord-\ntenant arrangement, or so on. We have never accepted\nsuch a boundless theory of standing. The cases Already\ncites for this remarkable proposition stand for no such\nthing. In each of those cases, standing was based on\nan injury more particularized and more concrete than\nthe mere assertion that something unlawful benefited the\nplaintiff \u2019s competitor. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U. S.\n656 (1993); Super Tire Engineering Co. v. McCorkle, 416\nU.

This\nconcern cannot compel us to adopt Already\u2019s broad theory\nof standing.\n   First of all, granting covenants not to sue may be a\nrisky long-term strategy for a trademark holder. See, e.g.,\n3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks & Unfair Competition\n\u00a718:48, p. 18\u2013112 (4th ed. 2012) (\u201c[U]ncontrolled and \u2018naked\u2019\nlicensing can result in such a loss of significance of a\ntrademark that a federal registration should be can-\ncelled\u201d); Sun Banks of Fla., Inc. v. Sun Fed. Sav. & Loan\nAssn., 651 F. 2d 311, 316 (CA5 1981) (finding that \u201cexten-\nsive third-party use of the [mark was] impressive evidence\nthat there would be no likelihood of confusion\u201d). In addi-\ntion, the Lanham Act provides some check on abusive\nlitigation practices by providing for an award of attorney\u2019s\nfees in \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a71117(a); cf., e.g.,\nGwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Founda-\ntion, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 67, n. 6 (1987) (explaining that an\naward of litigation costs can protect \u201cfrom the suddenly\nrepentant defendant\u201d).\n   Accepting Already\u2019s theory may benefit the small com-\npetitor in this case. But lowering the gates for one party\nlowers the gates for all. As a result, larger companies with\nmore resources will have standing to challenge the intel-\nlectual property portfolios of their more humble rivals\u2014\nnot because they are threatened by any particular patent\nor trademark, but simply because they are competitors in\nthe same market. This would further encourage parties to\nemploy litigation as a weapon against their competitors\nrather than as a last resort for settling disputes.\n   Already\u2019s only legally cognizable injury\u2014the fact that\nNike took steps to enforce its trademark\u2014is now gone\nand, given the breadth of the covenant, cannot reasonably\nbe expected to recur. There being no other basis on which\n14               ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto find a live controversy, the case is clearly moot.\n                              V\n   The Solicitor General asks us to \u201cremand the case for\nfurther proceedings in which the parties can develop the\nrecord on both the scope of the covenant and petitioner\u2019s\nbusiness activities, and the courts below can apply the\nproper standard to the record.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 28.\n   Such a remand would serve no purpose. The scope of\nthe covenant is clear. Already\u2019s argument is not that the\ncovenant could be drafted more broadly, but instead that\nno covenant would ever do. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313.\n   As for business activities, it is plain that Already has\nsaid all it has to say. The District Court held a hearing\non whether the case was mooted by the covenant. There,\nand at every stage of the proceedings thereafter, Already\nsteadfastly refused to suggest that it has any plans to\ncreate any arguably infringing shoe that does not unam-\nbiguously fall within the scope of the covenant\u2014this de-\nspite every incentive, opportunity, and invitation to do so.\nAs noted, the District Court expressly found \u201cno indica-\ntion\u201d that Already had any such plans, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 31a, and Already never challenged this finding. It\ndid not challenge that finding on appeal to the Second\nCircuit, even though its significance was clear. The Court\nof Appeals expressly found that Already \u201chas not asserted\nany intention to market any such shoe.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 97.\nAlready declined to challenge these conclusions before us,\ndespite questions from the bench addressing that particu-\nlar issue. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u20138.\n   The courts below did not expressly invoke the voluntary\ncessation standard, as articulated in our cases. But the\nanalysis in their opinions addressed the same questions\nwe have addressed today under that standard. In deter-\nmining the case was moot, they relied, as we have, on the\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

The Dis-\ntrict Court explained that \u201c[w]hether a covenant not to sue\nwill divest the trial court of jurisdiction depends on what\nis covered by the covenant.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It read the covenant\n\u201cbroadly,\u201d id., at 34a, and found \u201cno indication that any of\n[Already\u2019s] forthcoming models would extend beyond this\nbroad language,\u201d id., at 31a. It even concluded that from\nAlready\u2019s perspective, there was \u201clittle difference\u201d between\ninvalidating the trademark and the scope of protection al-\nready afforded by the covenant. Id., at 34a.\n   Likewise, the Court of Appeals asked \u201cwhether the\ncovenant covers future, as well as past, activity and prod-\nucts,\u201d and inquired into \u201cevidence of intention or lack of\nintention, on the part of the party asserting jurisdiction,\nto engage in new activity or to develop new potentially\ninfringing products that arguably are not covered by the\ncovenant.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 96. It concluded that \u201c[t]he\nbreadth of the Covenant renders the threat of litigation\nremote or nonexistent\u201d because it could not envision a\nshoe that would be within Nike\u2019s trademark yet not pro-\ntected by the covenant, noting that Already \u201chas not as-\nserted any intention to market any such shoe.\u201d Id., at 97.\n   Under such circumstances, a remand would serve no\npurpose.

The burden was not on Already to show\nthat a justiciable controversy remains. Under the volun-\ntary cessation doctrine, Nike bears the \u201cformidable burden\nof showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly wrong-\nful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Ser-\nvices (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 190 (2000). In the cir-\ncumstances here, then, Nike must demonstrate that the\ncovenant not to sue is of sufficient breadth and force that\nAlready can have no reasonable anticipation of a future\ntrademark infringement claim from Nike.\n  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals issued\ntheir rulings on the erroneous premise that it was for\nAlready to make the relevant showing. When a court has\nimposed the burden to establish a certain proposition on\nthe wrong party, remand from a reviewing court is often\nappropriate to determine whether the outcome would have\nbeen different had the proper rule been applied. Here,\nhowever, the Court concludes the case must be deemed\nmoot in all events, based on the terms and scope of the\n2                ALREADY, LLC v. NIKE, INC.\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\ncovenant and on Already\u2019s seeming insistence that no\nmatter how it might be worded, a covenant drawn by the\ntrademark holder cannot moot the case. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 33\u201334; Tr. of Oral Arg. 10\u201313. For reasons the\nCourt states, this goes too far. Already appears also to dis-\nclaim any need to determine whether there is a real like-\nlihood it will produce a new product that, first, is not a\ncolorable imitation of its existing product line, and, sec-\nond, might be thought to infringe Nike\u2019s trademark.\n   This brief, separate concurrence is written to underscore\nthat covenants like the one Nike filed here ought not to\nbe taken as an automatic means for the party who first\ncharged a competitor with trademark infringement sud-\ndenly to abandon the suit without incurring the risk of\nan ensuing adverse adjudication. Courts should be well\naware that charges of trademark infringement can be\ndisruptive to the good business relations between the\nmanufacturer alleged to have been an infringer and its dis-\ntributors, retailers, and investors. The mere pendency of\nlitigation can mean that other actors in the marketplace\nmay be reluctant to have future dealings with the alleged\ninfringer. Nike appears to have been well aware of that\ndynamic in this case. In referring to Already it stated at\none point: \u201c[O]ver the past eight months, Nike has cleared\nout the worst offending infringers. Now Already remains\nas one of the last few companies that was identified on\nthat top ten list of infringers.\u201d App. 114a.\n   Any demonstrated reluctance by investors, distributors,\nand retailers to maintain good relations with the alleged\ninfringer might, in an appropriate case, be an indication\nthat the market itself anticipates that a new line of prod-\nucts could be outside the covenant not to sue yet still\nwithin a zone of alleged infringement. And, as noted at\nthe outset, it is the trademark holder who has the burden\nto show that this is not the case. It is not the burden of\nthe alleged infringer to prove that the covenant not to sue\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\nis inadequate to protect its current and future products\nfrom a trademark enforcement action.\n   In later cases careful consideration must be given to the\nconsequences of using a covenant not to sue as the basis\nfor a motion to dismiss as moot. If the holder of an alleged\ntrademark can commence suit against a competitor; in\nmidcourse file a covenant not to sue; and then require\nthe competitor and its business network to engage in costly,\nsatellite proceedings to demonstrate that future produc-\ntion or sales might still be compromised, it would seem\nthat the trademark holder\u2019s burden to show the case is\nmoot may fall well short of being formidable. The very\nsuit the trademark holder initiated and later seeks to de-\nclare moot may still cause disruption and costs to the\ncompetition. The formidable burden to show the case is\nmoot ought to require the trademark holder, at the outset,\nto make a substantial showing that the business of the\ncompetitor and its supply network will not be disrupted or\nweakened by satellite litigation over mootness or by any\nthreat latent in the terms of the covenant itself. It would\nbe most unfair to allow the party who commences the suit\nto use its delivery of a covenant not to sue as an op-\nportunity to force a competitor to expose its future business\nplans or to otherwise disadvantage the competitor and its\nbusiness network, all in aid of deeming moot a suit the\ntrademark holder itself chose to initiate.\n   There are relatively few cases that have discussed the\nmeaning and effect of covenants not to sue in the context\nof ongoing litigation. See, e.g., Revolution Eyewear, Inc. v.\nAspex Eyewear, Inc., 556 F. 3d 1294 (CA Fed. 2009); Car-\naco Pharmaceutical Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc., 527\nF. 3d 1278 (CA Fed. 2008). Courts should proceed with\ncaution before ruling that they can be used to terminate\nlitigation. An insistence on the proper allocation of the\nformidable burden on the party asserting mootness is\none way to ensure that covenants are not automatic mech-\n4               ALREADY, LLC v.
