UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11\u20138976. Argued November 6, 2012\u2014Decided January 9, 2013\nPetitioner Smith claimed that conspiracy charges brought against him\n  for his role in an illegal drug business, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 and 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71962(d), were barred by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73282\u2019s 5-year statute of\n  limitations. The District Court instructed the jury to convict Smith\n  of each conspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a rea-\n  sonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith was a mem-\n  ber of those conspiracies, and that the conspiracies continued within\n  the applicable statute-of-limitations period. As to the affirmative de-\n  fense of withdrawal from the conspiracy, the court instructed the jury\n  that once the Government proved that Smith was a member of the\n  conspiracy, Smith had the burden to prove withdrawal outside the\n  statute of limitations by a preponderance of the evidence. Smith was\n  convicted, and the D. C. Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A defendant bears the burden of proving a defense of withdrawal.\n Pp. 3\u20138.\n    (a) Allocating to the defendant the burden of proving withdrawal\n does not violate the Due Process Clause. Unless an affirmative de-\n fense negates an element of the crime, the Government has no consti-\n tutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n See Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 6. Withdrawal does not ne-\n gate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here, but instead\n presupposes that the defendant committed the offense. Withdrawal\n terminates a defendant\u2019s liability for his co-conspirators\u2019 postwith-\n drawal acts, but he remains guilty of conspiracy.\n    Withdrawal that occurs beyond the statute-of-limitations period\n provides a complete defense to prosecution, but does not render the\n underlying conduct noncriminal. Thus, while union of withdrawal\n with a statute-of-limitations defense can free a defendant of criminal\n2                      SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    liability, it does not place upon the prosecution a constitutional re-\n    sponsibility to prove that he did not withdraw. As with other affirm-\n    ative defenses, the burden is on him. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Although Congress may assign the Government the burden of\n    proving the nonexistence of withdrawal, it did not do so here. Be-\n    cause Congress did not address the burden of proof for withdrawal in\n    21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(d), it is presumed that Congress\n    intended to preserve the common-law rule that affirmative defenses\n    are for the defendant to prove. Dixon, supra, at 13\u201314. The analysis\n    does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-of-\n    limitations defense. In that circumstance, the Government need only\n    prove that the conspiracy continued past the statute-of-limitations\n    period. A conspiracy continues until it is terminated or, as to a par-\n    ticular defendant, until that defendant withdraws. And the burden\n    of establishing withdrawal rests upon the defendant.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 9, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Upon joining a criminal conspiracy, a defendant\u2019s mem-\nbership in the ongoing unlawful scheme continues until he\nwithdraws. A defendant who withdraws outside the rele-\nvant statute-of-limitations period has a complete defense\nto prosecution. We consider whether, when the defend-\nant produces some evidence supporting such a defense,\nthe Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat he did not withdraw outside the statute-of-limitations\nperiod.\n                                I\n   Petitioner Calvin Smith was indicted for crimes con-\nnected to his role in an organization that distributed\ncocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in Washing-\nton, D. C., for about a decade. The 158-count indictment\ncharged Smith and 16 alleged co-conspirators with con-\nspiring to run, and actually running, an illegal drug busi-\nness, as well as with committing acts of violence, including\n31 murders, to further their goals. Smith was tried along-\nside five codefendants. A jury of the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Columbia convicted him of (1)\nconspiracy to distribute narcotics and to possess narcotics\n2                     SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the intent to distribute them, in violation of 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7846; (2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Or-\nganizations Act (RICO) conspiracy, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71962(d); (3) murder in connection with a contin-\nuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7848(e)(1)(A); and (4) four counts of murder while armed,\nin violation of D. C. Code \u00a7\u00a722\u20132401 and 22\u20133202 (1996).1\n   At issue here are Smith\u2019s conspiracy convictions. Before\ntrial, Smith moved to dismiss the conspiracy counts as\nbarred by the applicable 5-year statute of limitations, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73282, because he had spent the last six years of\nthe charged conspiracies in prison for a felony conviction.\nThe court denied his motion and Smith renewed his\nstatute-of-limitations defense at trial. In the final jury\ncharge, the court instructed the jury to convict Smith of each\nconspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith\nwas a member of those conspiracies, and that the conspir-\nacies \u201ccontinued in existence within five years\u201d before the\nindictment. App. 289a, 300a.\n   After it began deliberations, the jury asked the court\nwhat to do in the event that a defendant withdrew from\nthe conspiracies outside the relevant limitations period.2\nSmith had not yet raised an affirmative defense of with-\ndrawal, so the court for the first time instructed the jury\non the defense. The court explained that \u201c[t]he relevant\ndate for purposes of determining the statute of limitations\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 On appeal, the D. C. Circuit remanded two of the murder counts for\n\nthe District Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding whether\nSmith received ineffective assistance of counsel as to those convictions.\nUnited States v. Moore, 651 F. 3d 30, 89 (2011) (per curiam).\n   2 The note to the judge inquired: \u201c \u2018If we find that the Narcotics or\n\nRICO conspiracies continued after the relevant date under the statute\nof limitations, but that a particular defendant left the conspiracy before\nthe relevant date under the statute of limitations, must we find that\ndefendant not guilty? \u2019 \u201d App. 174a.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis the date, if any, on which a conspiracy concludes or a\ndate on which that defendant withdrew from that conspir-\nacy.\u201d Id., at 328a. It defined withdrawal as \u201caffirmative\nacts inconsistent with the goals of the conspiracy\u201d that\n\u201cwere communicated to the defendant\u2019s coconspirators in\na manner reasonably calculated to reach those conspira-\ntors.\u201d \u201cWithdrawal,\u201d the court instructed, \u201cmust be un-\nequivocal.\u201d Ibid. Over the defense\u2019s objection, the court\ntold the jury that \u201c[o]nce the government has proven that\na defendant was a member of a conspiracy, the burden is\non the defendant to prove withdrawal from a conspiracy\nby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Ibid. The jury then\nconvicted Smith of the conspiracy crimes.\n   As relevant here, the Court of Appeals affirmed Smith\u2019s\nconspiracy convictions. Recognizing that the Circuits are\ndivided on which party bears the burden of proving or dis-\nproving a defense of withdrawal prior to the limitations\nperiod, the court concluded that the defendant bears the\nburden of proof and that such a disposition does not vio-\nlate the Due Process Clause. United States v. Moore, 651\nF. 3d 30, 89\u201390 (CADC 2011) (per curiam). We granted\ncertiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n  Petitioner\u2019s claim lies at the intersection of a withdrawal\ndefense and a statute-of-limitations defense. He asserts\nthat once he presented evidence that he ended his mem-\nbership in the conspiracy prior to the statute-of-\nlimitations period, it became the Government\u2019s burden to\nprove that his individual participation in the conspiracy\npersisted within the applicable five-year window. This\nposition draws support neither from the Constitution (as\ndiscussed in this Part II), nor from the conspiracy and\nlimitations statutes at issue (as discussed in Part III,\ninfra). Establishing individual withdrawal was a burden\nthat rested firmly on the defendant regardless of when the\n4                     SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npurported withdrawal took place.\n   Allocating to a defendant the burden of proving with-\ndrawal does not violate the Due Process Clause. While the\nGovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cevery\nfact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the de-\nfendant] is charged,\u201d In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970), \u201c[p]roof of the nonexistence of all affirmative de-\nfenses has never been constitutionally required,\u201d Patterson\nv. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). The State is fore-\nclosed from shifting the burden of proof to the defendant\nonly \u201cwhen an affirmative defense does negate an element\nof the crime.\u201d Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 237 (1987)\n(Powell, J., dissenting). Where instead it \u201cexcuse[s] con-\nduct that would otherwise be punishable,\u201d but \u201cdoes not\ncontrovert any of the elements of the offense itself,\u201d the\nGovernment has no constitutional duty to overcome the\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt. Dixon v. United\nStates, 548 U. S. 1, 6 (2006).\n   Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspir-\nacy crimes charged here. The essence of conspiracy is \u201cthe\ncombination of minds in an unlawful purpose.\u201d United\nStates v. Hirsch, 100 U. S. 33, 34 (1879). To convict a de-\nfendant of narcotics or RICO conspiracy, the Govern-\nment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that two or\nmore people agreed to commit a crime covered by the\nspecific conspiracy statute (that a conspiracy existed) and\nthat the defendant knowingly and willfully participated in\nthe agreement (that he was a member of the conspiracy).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Narcoticsconspiracy under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 criminalizes \u201ccon-\nspir[ing] to commit any offense\u201d under the Controlled Substances\nAct, including the knowing distribution of, or possession with intent to\ndistribute, controlled substances, \u00a7841(a)(1). Section 1962(d) of Title 18\nmakes it unlawful to \u201cconspire to violate\u201d RICO, which makes it unlaw-\nful, among other things, \u201cfor any person employed by or associated with\nany enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or\nforeign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFar from contradicting an element of the offense, with-\ndrawal presupposes that the defendant committed the\noffense. Withdrawal achieves more modest ends than\nexoneration. Since conspiracy is a continuing offense,\nUnited States v. Kissel, 218 U. S. 601, 610 (1910), a de-\nfendant who has joined a conspiracy continues to violate\nthe law \u201cthrough every moment of [the conspiracy\u2019s] exist-\nence,\u201d Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 369 (1912),\nand he becomes responsible for the acts of his co-\nconspirators in pursuit of their common plot, Pinkerton v.\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 640, 646 (1946). Withdrawal\nterminates the defendant\u2019s liability for postwithdrawal\nacts of his co-conspirators, but he remains guilty of\nconspiracy.\n  Withdrawal also starts the clock running on the time\nwithin which the defendant may be prosecuted, and pro-\nvides a complete defense when the withdrawal occurs\nbeyond the applicable statute-of-limitations period.4 A\ncomplete defense, however, is not necessarily one that\nestablishes the defendant\u2019s innocence. For example, we\nhave held that although self-defense may entirely excuse\nor justify aggravated murder, \u201cthe elements of aggravated\nmurder and self-defense [do not] overlap in the sense that\nevidence to prove the latter will often tend to negate the\nformer.\u201d Martin, supra, at 234; see Leland v. Oregon, 343\nU. S. 790, 794\u2013796 (1952) (same for insanity defense).\nLikewise, although the statute of limitations may inhibit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity,\u201d \u00a71962(c).\n   4 The conspiracy statutes at issue here do not contain their own limi-\n\ntations periods, but are governed by \u00a73282(a), which provides: \u201cExcept\nas otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted,\ntried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is\nfound or the information is instituted within five years next after such\noffense shall have been committed.\u201d At the time petitioner was in-\ndicted, \u00a73282 contained no subsections; what was the full text of the sec-\ntion is now subsection (a).\n6                 SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprosecution, it does not render the underlying conduct\nnoncriminal. Commission of the crime within the statute-\nof-limitations period is not an element of the conspiracy\noffense. See United States v. Cook, 17 Wall. 168, 180\n(1872). The Government need not allege the time of the\noffense in the indictment, id., at 179\u2013180, and it is up to\nthe defendant to raise the limitations defense, Biddinger\nv. Commissioner of Police of City of New York, 245 U. S.\n128, 135 (1917). A statute-of-limitations defense does not\ncall the criminality of the defendant\u2019s conduct into ques-\ntion, but rather reflects a policy judgment by the legis-\nlature that the lapse of time may render criminal acts ill\nsuited for prosecution. See, e.g., Toussie v. United States,\n397 U. S. 112, 114\u2013115 (1970). Thus, although union of\nwithdrawal with a statute-of-limitations defense can free\nthe defendant of criminal liability, it does not place upon\nthe prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that\nhe did not withdraw. As with other affirmative defenses,\nthe burden is on him.\n                              III\n  Of course, Congress may choose to assign the Govern-\nment the burden of proving the nonexistence of withdrawal,\neven if that is not constitutionally required. It did not\ndo so here. \u201c[T]he common-law rule was that affirmative\ndefenses . . . were matters for the defendant to prove.\u201d\nMartin, supra, at 235; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 201 (1769). Because Congress did\nnot address in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(d)\nthe burden of proof for withdrawal, we presume that Con-\ngress intended to preserve the common-law rule. Dixon, 548\nU. S., at 13\u201314.\n  That Congress left the traditional burden of proof undis-\nturbed is both practical and fair. \u201c \u2018[W]here the facts with\nregard to an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a\nparty,\u2019 \u201d that party is best situated to bear the burden of\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproof. Id., at 9. On the matter of withdrawal, the in-\nformational asymmetry heavily favors the defendant. Pas-\nsive nonparticipation in the continuing scheme is not\nenough to sever the meeting of minds that constitutes the\nconspiracy. \u201c[T]o avert a continuing criminality\u201d there\nmust be \u201caffirmative action . . . to disavow or defeat the\npurpose\u201d of the conspiracy. Hyde, supra, at 369. The\ndefendant knows what steps, if any, he took to dissociate\nfrom his confederates. He can testify to his act of with-\ndrawal or direct the court to other evidence substantiating\nhis claim.5 It would be nearly impossible for the Gov-\nernment to prove the negative that an act of with-\ndrawal never happened. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72486,\np. 288 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (\u201cIt is often said that the\nburden is upon the party having in form the affirmative\nallegation\u201d). Witnesses with the primary power to refute a\nwithdrawal defense will often be beyond the Government\u2019s\nreach: The defendant\u2019s co-conspirators are likely to invoke\ntheir right against self-incrimination rather than explain\ntheir unlawful association with him.\n  Here again, the analysis does not change when with-\ndrawal is the basis for a statute-of-limitations defense. To\nbe sure, we have held that the Government must prove\nthe time of the conspiracy offense if a statute-of-limitations\ndefense is raised. Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S.\n391, 396 (1957). But the Government satisfied that bur-\nden here when it proved that the conspiracy continued\npast the statute-of-limitations period. For the offense in\nthese conspiracy prosecutions was not the initial act of\nagreement, but the banding-together against the law\neffected by that act, which continues until termination of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Here, Smith introduced a stipulation of his dates spent incarcerated,\n\nas well as \u201ctestimonial evidence showing that he was no longer a\nmember of the charged conspiracies during his incarceration.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 3. The jury found that this did not establish by a preponder-\nance of the evidence an affirmative act of withdrawal.\n8                SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe conspiracy or, as to a particular defendant, until that\ndefendant\u2019s withdrawal. And as we have discussed, the\nburden of establishing that withdrawal rests upon the\ndefendant.\n  Petitioner\u2019s claim that assertion of a statute-of-\nlimitations defense shifts that burden is incompatible with\nthe established proposition that a defendant\u2019s membership\nin the conspiracy, and his responsibility for its acts, en-\ndures even if he is entirely inactive after joining it. (\u201cAs\nhe has started evil forces he must withdraw his support\nfrom them or incur the guilt of their continuance.\u201d Hyde,\n225 U. S., at 369\u2013370.) For as a practical matter, the only\nway the Government would be able to establish a failure\nto withdraw would be to show active participation in the\nconspiracy during the limitations period.\n                       *     *   *\n  Having joined forces to achieve collectively more evil\nthan he could accomplish alone, Smith tied his fate to that\nof the group. His individual change of heart (assuming it\noccurred) could not put the conspiracy genie back in the\nbottle. We punish him for the havoc wreaked by the un-\nlawful scheme, whether or not he remained actively in-\nvolved. It is his withdrawal that must be active, and it\nwas his burden to show that.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n",

Argued November 6, 2012\u2014Decided January 9, 2013\nPetitioner Smith claimed that conspiracy charges brought against him\n  for his role in an illegal drug business, see 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 and 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71962(d), were barred by 18 U. S. C. \u00a73282\u2019s 5-year statute of\n  limitations. The District Court instructed the jury to convict Smith\n  of each conspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a rea-\n  sonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith was a mem-\n  ber of those conspiracies, and that the conspiracies continued within\n  the applicable statute-of-limitations period. As to the affirmative de-\n  fense of withdrawal from the conspiracy, the court instructed the jury\n  that once the Government proved that Smith was a member of the\n  conspiracy, Smith had the burden to prove withdrawal outside the\n  statute of limitations by a preponderance of the evidence. Smith was\n  convicted, and the D. C. Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: A defendant bears the burden of proving a defense of withdrawal.\n Pp. 3\u20138.\n    (a) Allocating to the defendant the burden of proving withdrawal\n does not violate the Due Process Clause. Unless an affirmative de-\n fense negates an element of the crime, the Government has no consti-\n tutional duty to overcome the defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n See Dixon v. United States, 548 U. S. 1, 6. Withdrawal does not ne-\n gate an element of the conspiracy crimes charged here, but instead\n presupposes that the defendant committed the offense. Withdrawal\n terminates a defendant\u2019s liability for his co-conspirators\u2019 postwith-\n drawal acts, but he remains guilty of conspiracy.\n    Withdrawal that occurs beyond the statute-of-limitations period\n provides a complete defense to prosecution, but does not render the\n underlying conduct noncriminal. Thus, while union of withdrawal\n with a statute-of-limitations defense can free a defendant of criminal\n2                      SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    liability, it does not place upon the prosecution a constitutional re-\n    sponsibility to prove that he did not withdraw. As with other affirm-\n    ative defenses, the burden is on him. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Although Congress may assign the Government the burden of\n    proving the nonexistence of withdrawal, it did not do so here. Be-\n    cause Congress did not address the burden of proof for withdrawal in\n    21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(d), it is presumed that Congress\n    intended to preserve the common-law rule that affirmative defenses\n    are for the defendant to prove. Dixon, supra, at 13\u201314. The analysis\n    does not change when withdrawal is the basis for a statute-of-\n    limitations defense. In that circumstance, the Government need only\n    prove that the conspiracy continued past the statute-of-limitations\n    period. A conspiracy continues until it is terminated or, as to a par-\n    ticular defendant, until that defendant withdraws. And the burden\n    of establishing withdrawal rests upon the defendant.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 9, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Upon joining a criminal conspiracy, a defendant\u2019s mem-\nbership in the ongoing unlawful scheme continues until he\nwithdraws. A defendant who withdraws outside the rele-\nvant statute-of-limitations period has a complete defense\nto prosecution. We consider whether, when the defend-\nant produces some evidence supporting such a defense,\nthe Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat he did not withdraw outside the statute-of-limitations\nperiod.\n                                I\n   Petitioner Calvin Smith was indicted for crimes con-\nnected to his role in an organization that distributed\ncocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, and marijuana in Washing-\nton, D. C., for about a decade. The 158-count indictment\ncharged Smith and 16 alleged co-conspirators with con-\nspiring to run, and actually running, an illegal drug busi-\nness, as well as with committing acts of violence, including\n31 murders, to further their goals. Smith was tried along-\nside five codefendants. A jury of the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Columbia convicted him of (1)\nconspiracy to distribute narcotics and to possess narcotics\n2                     SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the intent to distribute them, in violation of 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7846; (2) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Or-\nganizations Act (RICO) conspiracy, in violation of 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71962(d); (3) murder in connection with a contin-\nuing criminal enterprise, in violation of 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7848(e)(1)(A); and (4) four counts of murder while armed,\nin violation of D. C. Code \u00a7\u00a722\u20132401 and 22\u20133202 (1996).1\n   At issue here are Smith\u2019s conspiracy convictions. Before\ntrial, Smith moved to dismiss the conspiracy counts as\nbarred by the applicable 5-year statute of limitations, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a73282, because he had spent the last six years of\nthe charged conspiracies in prison for a felony conviction.\nThe court denied his motion and Smith renewed his\nstatute-of-limitations defense at trial. In the final jury\ncharge, the court instructed the jury to convict Smith of each\nconspiracy count if the Government had proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the conspiracies existed, that Smith\nwas a member of those conspiracies, and that the conspir-\nacies \u201ccontinued in existence within five years\u201d before the\nindictment. App. 289a, 300a.\n   After it began deliberations, the jury asked the court\nwhat to do in the event that a defendant withdrew from\nthe conspiracies outside the relevant limitations period.2\nSmith had not yet raised an affirmative defense of with-\ndrawal, so the court for the first time instructed the jury\non the defense. The court explained that \u201c[t]he relevant\ndate for purposes of determining the statute of limitations\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 On appeal, the D. C. Circuit remanded two of the murder counts for\n\nthe District Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding whether\nSmith received ineffective assistance of counsel as to those convictions.\nUnited States v. Moore, 651 F. 3d 30, 89 (2011) (per curiam).\n   2 The note to the judge inquired: \u201c \u2018If we find that the Narcotics or\n\nRICO conspiracies continued after the relevant date under the statute\nof limitations, but that a particular defendant left the conspiracy before\nthe relevant date under the statute of limitations, must we find that\ndefendant not guilty? \u2019 \u201d App. 174a.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis the date, if any, on which a conspiracy concludes or a\ndate on which that defendant withdrew from that conspir-\nacy.\u201d Id., at 328a. It defined withdrawal as \u201caffirmative\nacts inconsistent with the goals of the conspiracy\u201d that\n\u201cwere communicated to the defendant\u2019s coconspirators in\na manner reasonably calculated to reach those conspira-\ntors.\u201d \u201cWithdrawal,\u201d the court instructed, \u201cmust be un-\nequivocal.\u201d Ibid. Over the defense\u2019s objection, the court\ntold the jury that \u201c[o]nce the government has proven that\na defendant was a member of a conspiracy, the burden is\non the defendant to prove withdrawal from a conspiracy\nby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Ibid. The jury then\nconvicted Smith of the conspiracy crimes.\n   As relevant here, the Court of Appeals affirmed Smith\u2019s\nconspiracy convictions. Recognizing that the Circuits are\ndivided on which party bears the burden of proving or dis-\nproving a defense of withdrawal prior to the limitations\nperiod, the court concluded that the defendant bears the\nburden of proof and that such a disposition does not vio-\nlate the Due Process Clause. United States v. Moore, 651\nF. 3d 30, 89\u201390 (CADC 2011) (per curiam). We granted\ncertiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n  Petitioner\u2019s claim lies at the intersection of a withdrawal\ndefense and a statute-of-limitations defense. He asserts\nthat once he presented evidence that he ended his mem-\nbership in the conspiracy prior to the statute-of-\nlimitations period, it became the Government\u2019s burden to\nprove that his individual participation in the conspiracy\npersisted within the applicable five-year window. This\nposition draws support neither from the Constitution (as\ndiscussed in this Part II), nor from the conspiracy and\nlimitations statutes at issue (as discussed in Part III,\ninfra). Establishing individual withdrawal was a burden\nthat rested firmly on the defendant regardless of when the\n4                     SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npurported withdrawal took place.\n   Allocating to a defendant the burden of proving with-\ndrawal does not violate the Due Process Clause. While the\nGovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cevery\nfact necessary to constitute the crime with which [the de-\nfendant] is charged,\u201d In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970), \u201c[p]roof of the nonexistence of all affirmative de-\nfenses has never been constitutionally required,\u201d Patterson\nv. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). The State is fore-\nclosed from shifting the burden of proof to the defendant\nonly \u201cwhen an affirmative defense does negate an element\nof the crime.\u201d Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 237 (1987)\n(Powell, J., dissenting). Where instead it \u201cexcuse[s] con-\nduct that would otherwise be punishable,\u201d but \u201cdoes not\ncontrovert any of the elements of the offense itself,\u201d the\nGovernment has no constitutional duty to overcome the\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt. Dixon v. United\nStates, 548 U. S. 1, 6 (2006).\n   Withdrawal does not negate an element of the conspir-\nacy crimes charged here. The essence of conspiracy is \u201cthe\ncombination of minds in an unlawful purpose.\u201d United\nStates v. Hirsch, 100 U. S. 33, 34 (1879). To convict a de-\nfendant of narcotics or RICO conspiracy, the Govern-\nment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that two or\nmore people agreed to commit a crime covered by the\nspecific conspiracy statute (that a conspiracy existed) and\nthat the defendant knowingly and willfully participated in\nthe agreement (that he was a member of the conspiracy).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Narcoticsconspiracy under 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 criminalizes \u201ccon-\nspir[ing] to commit any offense\u201d under the Controlled Substances\nAct, including the knowing distribution of, or possession with intent to\ndistribute, controlled substances, \u00a7841(a)(1). Section 1962(d) of Title 18\nmakes it unlawful to \u201cconspire to violate\u201d RICO, which makes it unlaw-\nful, among other things, \u201cfor any person employed by or associated with\nany enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or\nforeign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFar from contradicting an element of the offense, with-\ndrawal presupposes that the defendant committed the\noffense. Withdrawal achieves more modest ends than\nexoneration. Since conspiracy is a continuing offense,\nUnited States v. Kissel, 218 U. S. 601, 610 (1910), a de-\nfendant who has joined a conspiracy continues to violate\nthe law \u201cthrough every moment of [the conspiracy\u2019s] exist-\nence,\u201d Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347, 369 (1912),\nand he becomes responsible for the acts of his co-\nconspirators in pursuit of their common plot, Pinkerton v.\nUnited States, 328 U. S. 640, 646 (1946). Withdrawal\nterminates the defendant\u2019s liability for postwithdrawal\nacts of his co-conspirators, but he remains guilty of\nconspiracy.\n  Withdrawal also starts the clock running on the time\nwithin which the defendant may be prosecuted, and pro-\nvides a complete defense when the withdrawal occurs\nbeyond the applicable statute-of-limitations period.4 A\ncomplete defense, however, is not necessarily one that\nestablishes the defendant\u2019s innocence. For example, we\nhave held that although self-defense may entirely excuse\nor justify aggravated murder, \u201cthe elements of aggravated\nmurder and self-defense [do not] overlap in the sense that\nevidence to prove the latter will often tend to negate the\nformer.\u201d Martin, supra, at 234; see Leland v. Oregon, 343\nU. S. 790, 794\u2013796 (1952) (same for insanity defense).\nLikewise, although the statute of limitations may inhibit\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering\nactivity,\u201d \u00a71962(c).\n   4 The conspiracy statutes at issue here do not contain their own limi-\n\ntations periods, but are governed by \u00a73282(a), which provides: \u201cExcept\nas otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted,\ntried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is\nfound or the information is instituted within five years next after such\noffense shall have been committed.\u201d At the time petitioner was in-\ndicted, \u00a73282 contained no subsections; what was the full text of the sec-\ntion is now subsection (a).\n6                 SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nprosecution, it does not render the underlying conduct\nnoncriminal. Commission of the crime within the statute-\nof-limitations period is not an element of the conspiracy\noffense. See United States v. Cook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88735\"><a href=\"/scotus/snV/united-states-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180\n(1872). The Government need not allege the time of the\noffense in the indictment, id., at 179\u2013180, and it is up to\nthe defendant to raise the limitations defense, Biddinger\nv. Commissioner of Police of City of New York, 245 U. S.\n128, 135 (1917). A statute-of-limitations defense does not\ncall the criminality of the defendant\u2019s conduct into ques-\ntion, but rather reflects a policy judgment by the legis-\nlature that the lapse of time may render criminal acts ill\nsuited for prosecution. See, e.g., Toussie v. United States,\n397 U. S. 112, 114\u2013115 (1970). Thus, although union of\nwithdrawal with a statute-of-limitations defense can free\nthe defendant of criminal liability, it does not place upon\nthe prosecution a constitutional responsibility to prove that\nhe did not withdraw. As with other affirmative defenses,\nthe burden is on him.\n                              III\n  Of course, Congress may choose to assign the Govern-\nment the burden of proving the nonexistence of withdrawal,\neven if that is not constitutionally required. It did not\ndo so here. \u201c[T]he common-law rule was that affirmative\ndefenses . . . were matters for the defendant to prove.\u201d\nMartin, supra, at 235; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\non the Laws of England 201 (1769). Because Congress did\nnot address in 21 U. S. C. \u00a7846 or 18 U. S. C. \u00a71962(d)\nthe burden of proof for withdrawal, we presume that Con-\ngress intended to preserve the common-law rule. Dixon, 548\nU. S., at 13\u201314.\n  That Congress left the traditional burden of proof undis-\nturbed is both practical and fair. \u201c \u2018[W]here the facts with\nregard to an issue lie peculiarly in the knowledge of a\nparty,\u2019 \u201d that party is best situated to bear the burden of\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproof. Id., at 9. On the matter of withdrawal, the in-\nformational asymmetry heavily favors the defendant. Pas-\nsive nonparticipation in the continuing scheme is not\nenough to sever the meeting of minds that constitutes the\nconspiracy. \u201c[T]o avert a continuing criminality\u201d there\nmust be \u201caffirmative action . . . to disavow or defeat the\npurpose\u201d of the conspiracy. Hyde, supra, at 369. The\ndefendant knows what steps, if any, he took to dissociate\nfrom his confederates. He can testify to his act of with-\ndrawal or direct the court to other evidence substantiating\nhis claim.5 It would be nearly impossible for the Gov-\nernment to prove the negative that an act of with-\ndrawal never happened. See 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72486,\np. 288 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1981) (\u201cIt is often said that the\nburden is upon the party having in form the affirmative\nallegation\u201d). Witnesses with the primary power to refute a\nwithdrawal defense will often be beyond the Government\u2019s\nreach: The defendant\u2019s co-conspirators are likely to invoke\ntheir right against self-incrimination rather than explain\ntheir unlawful association with him.\n  Here again, the analysis does not change when with-\ndrawal is the basis for a statute-of-limitations defense. To\nbe sure, we have held that the Government must prove\nthe time of the conspiracy offense if a statute-of-limitations\ndefense is raised. Grunewald v. United States, 353 U. S.\n391, 396 (1957). But the Government satisfied that bur-\nden here when it proved that the conspiracy continued\npast the statute-of-limitations period. For the offense in\nthese conspiracy prosecutions was not the initial act of\nagreement, but the banding-together against the law\neffected by that act, which continues until termination of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Here, Smith introduced a stipulation of his dates spent incarcerated,\n\nas well as \u201ctestimonial evidence showing that he was no longer a\nmember of the charged conspiracies during his incarceration.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 3. The jury found that this did not establish by a preponder-\nance of the evidence an affirmative act of withdrawal.\n8                SMITH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe conspiracy or, as to a particular defendant, until that\ndefendant\u2019s withdrawal. And as we have discussed, the\nburden of establishing that withdrawal rests upon the\ndefendant.\n  Petitioner\u2019s claim that assertion of a statute-of-\nlimitations defense shifts that burden is incompatible with\nthe established proposition that a defendant\u2019s membership\nin the conspiracy, and his responsibility for its acts, en-\ndures even if he is entirely inactive after joining it. (\u201cAs\nhe has started evil forces he must withdraw his support\nfrom them or incur the guilt of their continuance.\u201d Hyde,\n225 U. S., at 369\u2013370.) For as a practical matter, the only\nway the Government would be able to establish a failure\nto withdraw would be to show active participation in the\nconspiracy during the limitations period.\n                       *     *   *\n  Having joined forces to achieve collectively more evil\nthan he could accomplish alone, Smith tied his fate to that\nof the group. His individual change of heart (assuming it\noccurred) could not put the conspiracy genie back in the\nbottle. We punish him for the havoc wreaked by the un-\nlawful scheme, whether or not he remained actively in-\nvolved. It is his withdrawal that must be active, and it\nwas his burden to show that.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
