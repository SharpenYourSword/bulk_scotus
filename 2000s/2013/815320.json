CITY OF RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11\u2013626.     Argued October 1, 2012\u2014Decided January 15, 2013\nPetitioner Lozman\u2019s floating home was a house-like plywood structure\n  with empty bilge space underneath the main floor to keep it afloat.\n  He had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by\n  the city of Riviera Beach (City). After various disputes with Lozman\n  and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina, the City\n  brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home,\n  seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass. Lozman\n  moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction. The Dis-\n  trict Court found the floating home to be a \u201cvessel\u201d under the Rules of\n  Construction Act, which defines a \u201cvessel\u201d as including \u201cevery de-\n  scription of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable\n  of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a73,\n  concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper, and awarded the\n  City dockage fees and nominal damages. The Eleventh Circuit af-\n  firmed, agreeing that the home was a \u201cvessel\u201d since it was \u201ccapable\u201d\n  of movement over water despite petitioner\u2019s subjective intent to re-\n  main moored indefinitely.\nHeld:\n     1. This case is not moot. The District Court ordered the floating\n home sold, and the City purchased the home at auction and had it\n destroyed. Before the sale, the court ordered the City to post a bond\n to ensure Lozman could obtain monetary relief if he prevailed. P. 3.\n     2. Lozman\u2019s floating home is not a \u00a73 \u201cvessel.\u201d Pp. 3\u201315.\n        (a) The Eleventh Circuit found the home \u201ccapable of being used\n . . . as a means of transportation on water\u201d because it could float and\n proceed under tow and its shore connections did not render it incapa-\n ble of transportation. This interpretation is too broad. The definition\n of \u201ctransportation,\u201d the conveyance of persons or things from one\n2                      LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    place to another, must be applied in a practical way. Stewart v. Du-\n    tra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 496. Consequently, a structure does\n    not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable\n    observer, looking to the home\u2019s physical characteristics and activities,\n    would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or\n    things over water. Pp. 3\u20135.\n         (b) But for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman\u2019s home\n    suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport\n    persons or things over water. It had no steering mechanism, had an\n    unraked hull and rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water, and\n    had no capacity to generate or store electricity. It also lacked self-\n    propulsion, differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.\n    Pp. 5\u20136.\n         (c) This view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent,\n    and relevant purposes. The statute\u2019s language, read naturally, lends\n    itself to that interpretation: The term \u201ccontrivance\u201d refers to some-\n    thing \u201cemployed in contriving to effect a purpose\u201d; \u201ccraft\u201d explains\n    that purpose as \u201cwater carriage and transport\u201d; the addition of \u201cwa-\n    ter\u201d to \u201ccraft\u201d emphasizes the point; and the words, \u201cused, or capable\n    of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\u201d drive the point\n    home. Both Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola\n    Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19, and Stewart, supra, support this conclu-\n    sion. Evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock, used to\n    transfer cargo, and towed to harbor each winter; and Stewart in-\n    volved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor, which car-\n    ried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating\n    anchors and cables or by being towed. Water transportation was not\n    the primary purpose of either structure; neither was in motion at rel-\n    evant times; and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom\n    or to land. However, Stewart\u2019s dredge, which was regularly, but not\n    primarily, used to transport workers and equipment over water, fell\n    within the statutory definition while Evansville\u2019s wharfboat, which\n    was not designed to, and did not, serve a transportation function, did\n    not. Lower court cases, on balance, also tend to support this conclu-\n    sion. Further, the purposes of major federal maritime statutes\u2014e.g.,\n    admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a\n    vessel avoid liability by sailing away, recognize that sailors face spe-\n    cial perils at sea, and encourage shipowners to engage in port-related\n    commerce\u2014reveal little reason to classify floating homes as \u201cvessels.\u201d\n    Finally, this conclusion is consistent with state laws in States where\n    floating home owners have congregated in communities. Pp. 6\u201311.\n         (d) Several important arguments made by the City and its amici\n    are unavailing. They argue that a purpose-based test may introduce\n    a subjective element into \u201cvessel\u201d determinations. But the Court has\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

They also argue against using criteria that are too abstract,\n  complex, or open-ended. While this Court\u2019s approach is neither per-\n  fectly precise nor always determinative, it is workable and consistent\n  and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.\n  And contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the Court sees nothing to be\n  gained by a remand. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       (e) The City\u2019s additional argument that Lozman\u2019s floating home\n  was actually used for transportation over water is similarly unper-\n  suasive.

THE CITY OF\n\n           RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 15, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Rules of Construction Act defines a \u201cvessel\u201d as in-\ncluding \u201cevery description of watercraft or other artificial\ncontrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of\ntransportation on water.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a73. The question before\nus is whether petitioner\u2019s floating home (which is not self-\npropelled) falls within the terms of that definition.\n  In answering that question we focus primarily upon the\nphrase \u201ccapable of being used.\u201d This term encompasses\n\u201cpractical\u201d possibilities, not \u201cmerely . . . theoretical\u201d ones.\nStewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 496 (2005).\nWe believe that a reasonable observer, looking to the\nhome\u2019s physical characteristics and activities, would not\nconsider it to be designed to any practical degree for carry-\ning people or things on water. And we consequently con-\nclude that the floating home is not a \u201cvessel.\u201d\n                               I\n  In 2002 Fane Lozman, petitioner, bought a 60-foot by\n12-foot floating home. App. 37, 71. The home consisted of\na house-like plywood structure with French doors on three\nsides. Id., at 38, 44. It contained a sitting room, bedroom,\n2                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncloset, bathroom, and kitchen, along with a stairway\nleading to a second level with office space. Id., at 45\u201366.\nAn empty bilge space underneath the main floor kept it\nafloat. Id., at 38. (See Appendix, infra, for a photograph.)\nAfter buying the floating home, Lozman had it towed\nabout 200 miles to North Bay Village, Florida, where he\nmoored it and then twice more had it towed between\nnearby marinas. In 2006 Lozman had the home towed a\nfurther 70 miles to a marina owned by the city of Riviera\nBeach (City), respondent, where he kept it docked. Brief\nfor Respondent 5.\n   After various disputes with Lozman and unsuccessful\nefforts to evict him from the marina, the City brought\nthis federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating\nhome. It sought a maritime lien for dockage fees and\ndamages for trespass. See Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46\nU. S. C. \u00a731342 (authorizing federal maritime lien against\nvessel to collect debts owed for the provision of \u201cneces-\nsaries to a vessel\u201d); 28 U. S. C. \u00a71333(1) (civil admiralty\njurisdiction). See also Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185\n(1871); The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 215 (1867).\n   Lozman, acting pro se, asked the District Court to dis-\nmiss the suit on the ground that the court lacked admi-\nralty jurisdiction. See 2 Record, Doc. 64. After summary\njudgment proceedings, the court found that the floating\nhome was a \u201cvessel\u201d and concluded that admiralty juris-\ndiction was consequently proper. Pet. for Cert. 42a. The\njudge then conducted a bench trial on the merits and\nawarded the City $3,039.88 for dockage along with $1 in\nnominal damages for trespass. Id., at 49a.\n   On appeal the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. Riviera Beach\nv. That Certain Unnamed Gray, Two-Story Vessel Approx-\nimately Fifty-Seven Feet in Length, 649 F. 3d 1259 (2011).\nIt agreed with the District Court that the home was a\n\u201cvessel.\u201d In its view, the home was \u201ccapable\u201d of movement\nover water and the owner\u2019s subjective intent to remain\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmoored \u201cindefinitely\u201d at a dock could not show the con-\ntrary. Id., at 1267\u20131269.\n  Lozman sought certiorari. In light of uncertainty among\nthe Circuits about application of the term \u201ccapable\u201d we\ngranted his petition. Compare De La Rosa v. St. Charles\nGaming Co., 474 F. 3d 185, 187 (CA5 2006) (structure is\nnot a \u201cvessel\u201d where \u201cphysically,\u201d but only \u201ctheoretical[ly],\u201d\n\u201ccapable of sailing,\u201d and owner intends to moor it indef-\ninitely as floating casino), with Board of Comm\u2019rs of Or-\nleans Levee Dist. v. M/V Belle of Orleans, 535 F. 3d 1299,\n1311\u20131312 (CA11 2008) (structure is a \u201cvessel\u201d where\ncapable of moving over water under tow, \u201calbeit to her\ndetriment,\u201d despite intent to moor indefinitely). See also\n649 F. 3d, at 1267 (rejecting views of Circuits that \u201c \u2018focus\non the intent of the shipowner\u2019 \u201d).\n                              II\n   At the outset we consider one threshold matter. The\nDistrict Court ordered the floating home sold to satisfy\nthe City\u2019s judgment. The City bought the home at public\nauction and subsequently had it destroyed. And, after the\nparties filed their merits briefs, we ordered further brief-\ning on the question of mootness in light of the home\u2019s\ndestruction. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). The parties now have\npointed out that, prior to the home\u2019s sale, the District\nCourt ordered the City to post a $25,000 bond \u201cto secure\nMr. Lozman\u2019s value in the vessel.\u201d 1 Record, Doc. 20, p. 2.\nThe bond ensures that Lozman can obtain monetary relief\nif he ultimately prevails. We consequently agree with the\nparties that the case is not moot.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  We focus primarily upon the statutory phrase \u201ccapable\nof being used . . . as a means of transportation on water.\u201d\n1 U. S. C. \u00a73. The Court of Appeals found that the home\n4                 LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwas \u201ccapable\u201d of transportation because it could float, it\ncould proceed under tow, and its shore connections (power\ncable, water hose, rope lines) did not \u201c \u2018rende[r]\u2019 \u201d it \u201c \u2018prac-\ntically incapable of transportation or movement.\u2019 \u201d 649\nF. 3d, at 1266 (quoting Belle of Orleans, supra, at 1312,\nin turn quoting Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494). At least for\nargument\u2019s sake we agree with the Court of Appeals about\nthe last-mentioned point, namely that Lozman\u2019s shore\nconnections did not \u201c \u2018render\u2019 \u201d the home \u201c \u2018practically inca-\npable of transportation.\u2019 \u201d But unlike the Eleventh Circuit,\nwe do not find these considerations (even when combined\nwith the home\u2019s other characteristics) sufficient to show\nthat Lozman\u2019s home was a \u201cvessel.\u201d\n   The Court of Appeals recognized that it had applied\nthe term \u201ccapable\u201d broadly. 649 F. 3d, at 1266. Indeed,\nit pointed with approval to language in an earlier case,\nBurks v. American River Transp. Co., 679 F. 2d 69 (1982),\nin which the Fifth Circuit said:\n    \u201c \u2018No doubt the three men in a tub would also fit with-\n    in our definition, and one probably could make a con-\n    vincing case for Jonah inside the whale.\u2019 \u201d 649 F. 3d,\n    at 1269 (brackets omitted) (quoting Burks, supra, at\n    75).\nBut the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation is too broad. Not\nevery floating structure is a \u201cvessel.\u201d To state the obvious,\na wooden washtub, a plastic dishpan, a swimming plat-\nform on pontoons, a large fishing net, a door taken off\nits hinges, or Pinocchio (when inside the whale) are not\n\u201cvessels,\u201d even if they are \u201cartificial contrivance[s]\u201d capable\nof floating, moving under tow, and incidentally carrying\neven a fair-sized item or two when they do so. Rather, the\nstatute applies to an \u201cartificial contrivance . . . capable of\nbeing used . . . as a means of transportation on water.\u201d 1\nU. S. C. \u00a73 (emphasis added). \u201c[T]ransportation\u201d involves\nthe \u201cconveyance (of things or persons) from one place to\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nanother.\u201d 18 Oxford English Dictionary 424 (2d ed. 1989)\n(OED). Accord, N. Webster, An American Dictionary of\nthe English Language 1406 (C. Goodrich & N. Porter\neds. 1873) (\u201c[t]he act of transporting, carrying, or conveying\nfrom one place to another\u201d). And we must apply this\ndefinition in a \u201cpractical,\u201d not a \u201ctheoretical,\u201d way. Stew-\nart, supra, at 496. Consequently, in our view a structure\ndoes not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase\nunless a reasonable observer, looking to the home\u2019s phys-\nical characteristics and activities, would consider it de-\nsigned to a practical degree for carrying people or things\nover water.\n                              B\n   Though our criterion is general, the facts of this case\nillustrate more specifically what we have in mind. But\nfor the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman\u2019s home\nsuggests that it was designed to any practical degree to\ntransport persons or things over water. It had no rudder\nor other steering mechanism. 649 F. 3d, at 1269. Its hull\nwas unraked, ibid., and it had a rectangular bottom 10\ninches below the water. Brief for Petitioner 27; App. 37.\nIt had no special capacity to generate or store electricity\nbut could obtain that utility only through ongoing connec-\ntions with the land. Id., at 40. Its small rooms looked like\nordinary nonmaritime living quarters. And those inside\nthose rooms looked out upon the world, not through water-\ntight portholes, but through French doors or ordinary\nwindows. Id., at 44\u201366.\n   Although lack of self-propulsion is not dispositive, e.g.,\nThe Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 31 (1903), it may be\na relevant physical characteristic. And Lozman\u2019s home\ndiffers significantly from an ordinary houseboat in that it\nhas no ability to propel itself. Cf. 33 CFR \u00a7173.3 (2012)\n(\u201cHouseboat means a motorized vessel . . . designed pri-\nmarily for multi-purpose accommodation spaces with low\n6                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfreeboard and little or no foredeck or cockpit\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Lozman\u2019s home was able to travel over water\nonly by being towed. Prior to its arrest, that home\u2019s travel\nby tow over water took place on only four occasions over a\nperiod of seven years. Supra, at 2. And when the home\nwas towed a significant distance in 2006, the towing com-\npany had a second boat follow behind to prevent the home\nfrom swinging dangerously from side to side. App. 104.\n  The home has no other feature that might suggest a\ndesign to transport over water anything other than its\nown furnishings and related personal effects. In a word,\nwe can find nothing about the home that could lead a\nreasonable observer to consider it designed to a practical\ndegree for \u201ctransportation on water.\u201d\n                                C\n   Our view of the statute is consistent with its text, prece-\ndent, and relevant purposes. For one thing, the statute\u2019s\nlanguage, read naturally, lends itself to that interpreta-\ntion. We concede that the statute uses the word \u201cevery,\u201d\nreferring to \u201cevery description of watercraft or other artifi-\ncial contrivance.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a73 (emphasis added). But\nthe term \u201ccontrivance\u201d refers to \u201csomething contrived for,\nor employed in contriving to effect a purpose.\u201d 3 OED 850\n(def. 7). The term \u201ccraft\u201d explains that purpose as \u201cwater\ncarriage and transport.\u201d Id., at 1104 (def. V(9)(b)) (de-\nfining \u201ccraft\u201d as a \u201cvesse[l] . . . for\u201d that purpose). The ad-\ndition of the word \u201cwater\u201d to \u201ccraft,\u201d yielding the term\n\u201cwatercraft,\u201d emphasizes the point. And the next few words,\n\u201cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transporta-\ntion on water,\u201d drive the point home.\n   For another thing, the bulk of precedent supports our\nconclusion. In Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v.\nChero Cola Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19 (1926), the Court\nheld that a wharfboat was not a \u201cvessel.\u201d The wharfboat\nfloated next to a dock; it was used to transfer cargo from\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

At\nthe same time, it was capable of being towed. And it\nwas towed each winter to a harbor to avoid river ice. Id.,\nat 20\u201321. The Court reasoned that, despite the annual\nmovement under tow, the wharfboat \u201cwas not used to\ncarry freight from one place to another,\u201d nor did it \u201cen-\ncounter perils of navigation to which craft used for trans-\nportation are exposed.\u201d Id., at 22. (See Appendix, infra,\nfor photograph of a period wharfboat).\n   The Court\u2019s reasoning in Stewart also supports our\nconclusion. We there considered the application of the\nstatutory definition to a dredge. 543 U. S., at 494. The\ndredge was \u201ca massive floating platform\u201d from which a\nsuspended clamshell bucket would \u201cremov[e] silt from the\nocean floor,\u201d depositing it \u201conto one of two scows\u201d floating\nalongside the dredge. Id., at 484. Like more traditional\n\u201cseagoing vessels,\u201d the dredge had, e.g., \u201ca captain and\ncrew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining\narea.\u201d Ibid. Unlike more ordinary vessels, it could navi-\ngate only by \u201cmanipulating its anchors and cables\u201d or by\nbeing towed. Ibid. Nonetheless it did move. In fact it\nmoved over water \u201cevery couple of hours.\u201d Id., at 485.\n   We held that the dredge was a \u201cvessel.\u201d We wrote that\n\u00a73\u2019s definition \u201cmerely codified the meaning that the term\n\u2018vessel\u2019 had acquired in general maritime law.\u201d Id., at 490.\nWe added that the question of the \u201cwatercraft\u2019s use \u2018as a\nmeans of transportation on water\u2019 is . . . practical,\u201d and not\n\u201cmerely . . . theoretical.\u201d Id., at 496. And we pointed to\ncases holding that dredges ordinarily \u201cserved a waterborne\ntransportation function,\u201d namely that \u201cin performing their\nwork they carried machinery, equipment, and crew over\nwater.\u201d Id., at 491\u2013492 (citing, e.g., Butler v. Ellis, 45\nF. 2d 951, 955 (CA4 1930)).\n   As the Court of Appeals pointed out, in Stewart we also\nwrote that \u00a73 \u201cdoes not require that a watercraft be used\n8                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprimarily for that [transportation] purpose,\u201d 543 U. S.,\nat 495; that a \u201cwatercraft need not be in motion to qualify\nas a vessel,\u201d ibid.; and that a structure may qualify as a\nvessel even if attached\u2014but not \u201cpermanently\u201d attached\u2014\nto the land or ocean floor. Id., at 493\u2013494. We did not\ntake these statements, however, as implying a universal\nset of sufficient conditions for application of the definition.\nRather, they say, and they mean, that the statutory defi-\nnition may (or may not) apply\u2014not that it automatically\nmust apply\u2014where a structure has some other primary\npurpose, where it is stationary at relevant times, and\nwhere it is attached\u2014but not permanently attached\u2014to\nland.\n   After all, a washtub is normally not a \u201cvessel\u201d though it\ndoes not have water transportation as its primary pur-\npose, it may be stationary much of the time, and it might\nbe attached\u2014but not permanently attached\u2014to land.\nMore to the point, water transportation was not the pri-\nmary purpose of either Stewart\u2019s dredge or Evansville\u2019s\nwharfboat; neither structure was \u201cin motion\u201d at relevant\ntimes; and both were sometimes attached (though not\npermanently attached) to the ocean bottom or to land.\nNonetheless Stewart\u2019s dredge fell within the statute\u2019s\ndefinition while Evansville\u2019s wharfboat did not.\n   The basic difference, we believe, is that the dredge was\nregularly, but not primarily, used (and designed in part to\nbe used) to transport workers and equipment over water\nwhile the wharfboat was not designed (to any practical\ndegree) to serve a transportation function and did not do\nso. Compare Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U. S. 625\n(1887) (floating drydock not a \u201cvessel\u201d because permanently\nfixed to wharf), with Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great\nLakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S. 527, 535 (1995) (barge\nsometimes attached to river bottom to use as a work plat-\nform remains a \u201cvessel\u201d when \u201cat other times it was used\nfor transportation\u201d).

See, e.g., Bernard v. Binnings Constr. Co., 741\nF. 2d 824, 828, n. 13, 832, n. 25 (CA5 1984) (work punt\nlacking features objectively indicating a transportation\nfunction not a \u201cvessel,\u201d for \u201cour decisions make clear that\nthe mere capacity to float or move across navigable waters\ndoes not necessarily make a structure a vessel\u201d); Rud-\ndiman v.

Co., 199 F. 2d\n715 (CA4 1952) (derrick anchored in the river engaged in\nbuilding a bridge is a vessel). For the reasons we have\nstated, we find such an approach inappropriate and incon-\nsistent with our precedents.\n   Further, our examination of the purposes of major fed-\neral maritime statutes reveals little reason to classify\nfloating homes as \u201cvessels.\u201d Admiralty law, for example,\nprovides special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid\nliability by sailing away. 46 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a731341\u201331343 (2006\ned. and Supp. IV). Liability statutes such as the Jones Act\nrecognize that sailors face the special \u201c \u2018perils of the sea.\u2019 \u201d\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354, 373 (1995)\n(referring to \u201c \u2018vessel[s] in navigation\u2019 \u201d). Certain admiralty\ntort doctrines can encourage shipowners to engage in\nport-related commerce. E.g., 46 U. S. C. \u00a730505; Executive\nJet Aviation, Inc. v. Cleveland, 409 U. S. 249, 269\u2013270\n(1972). And maritime safety statutes subject vessels to U. S.\nCoast Guard inspections. E.g., 46 U. S. C. \u00a73301.\n   Lozman, however, cannot easily escape liability by\nsailing away in his home. He faces no special sea dangers.\nHe does not significantly engage in port-related commerce.\nAnd the Solicitor General tells us that to adopt a version\nof the \u201canything that floats\u201d test would place unneces-\nsary and undesirable inspection burdens upon the Coast\nGuard. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29,\nn. 11.\n   Finally, our conclusion is consistent with state laws\nin States where floating home owners have congregated in\ncommunities. See Brief for Seattle Floating Homes As-\nsociation et al. as Amici Curiae 1. A Washington State\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenvironmental statute, for example, defines a floating\nhome (for regulatory purposes) as \u201ca single-family dwell-\ning unit constructed on a float, that is moored, anchored,\nor otherwise secured in waters, and is not a vessel, even\nthough it may be capable of being towed.\u201d Wash. Rev.\nCode Ann. \u00a790.58.270(5)(b)(ii) (Supp. 2012). A California\nstatute defines a floating home (for tax purposes) as \u201ca\nfloating structure\u201d that is \u201cdesigned and built to be used,\nor is modified to be used, as a stationary waterborne resi-\ndential dwelling,\u201d and which (unlike a typical houseboat),\nhas no independent power generation, and is dependent\non shore utilities. Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\u00a718075.55(d) (West 2006). These States, we are told, treat\nstructures that meet their \u201cfloating home\u201d definitions like\nordinary land-based homes rather than like vessels. Brief\nfor Seattle Floating Homes Association 2. Consistency of\ninterpretation of related state and federal laws is a virtue\nin that it helps to create simplicity making the law easier\nto understand and to follow for lawyers and for nonlaw-\nyers alike. And that consideration here supports our\nconclusion.\n                             D\n  The City and supporting amici make several important\narguments that warrant our response. First, they ar-\ngue against use of any purpose-based test lest we intro-\nduce into \u201cvessel\u201d determinations a subjective element\u2014\nnamely, the owner\u2019s intent. That element, they say, is\noften \u201cunverifiable\u201d and too easily manipulated. Its intro-\nduction would \u201cfoment unpredictability and invite games-\nmanship.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33.\n  We agree with the City about the need to eliminate the\nconsideration of evidence of subjective intent. But we\ncannot agree that the need requires abandonment of all\ncriteria based on \u201cpurpose.\u201d Cf. Stewart, 543 U. S., at 495\n(discussing transportation purpose). Indeed, it is difficult,\n12               LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif not impossible, to determine the use of a human \u201ccon-\ntrivance\u201d without some consideration of human purposes.\nAt the same time, we have sought to avoid subjective\nelements, such as owner\u2019s intent, by permitting considera-\ntion only of objective evidence of a waterborne transporta-\ntion purpose. That is why we have referred to the views of\na reasonable observer. Supra, at 1. And it is why we have\nlooked to the physical attributes and behavior of the struc-\nture, as objective manifestations of any relevant purpose,\nand not to the subjective intent of the owner. Supra, at\n5\u20136. We note that various admiralty treatises refer to\nthe use of purpose-based tests without any suggestion that\nadministration of those tests has introduced too much\nsubjectivity into the vessel-determination process.        1\nBenedict on Admiralty \u00a7164; 1 Admiralty and Maritime\nLaw \u00a73\u20136.\n   Second, the City, with support of amici, argues against\nthe use of criteria that are too abstract, complex, or open-\nended. Brief for Respondent 28\u201329. A court\u2019s jurisdiction,\ne.g., admiralty jurisdiction, may turn on application of\nthe term \u201cvessel.\u201d And jurisdictional tests, often applied\nat the outset of a case, should be \u201cas simple as possible.\u201d\nHertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 1).\n   We agree with the last-mentioned sentiment. And we\nalso understand that our approach is neither perfectly pre-\ncise nor always determinative. Satisfaction of a design-\nbased or purpose-related criterion, for example, is not\nalways sufficient for application of the statutory word\n\u201cvessel.\u201d A craft whose physical characteristics and activi-\nties objectively evidence a waterborne transportation\npurpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by\nlater physical alterations. For example, an owner might\ntake a structure that is otherwise a vessel (even the Queen\nMary) and connect it permanently to the land for use, say,\nas a hotel. See Stewart, supra, at 493\u2013494. Further,\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchanges over time may produce a new form, i.e., a newly\ndesigned structure\u2014in which case it may be the new de-\nsign that is relevant. See Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., 975\nF. 2d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was\nno longer a vessel where a \u201clarge opening [had been] cut\ninto her hull\u201d).\n    Nor is satisfaction of the criterion always a necessary\ncondition, see Part IV, infra. It is conceivable that an\nowner might actually use a floating structure not designed\nto any practical degree for transportation as, say, a ferry\nboat, regularly transporting goods and persons over water.\n    Nonetheless, we believe the criterion we have used,\ntaken together with our example of its application here,\nshould offer guidance in a significant number of borderline\ncases where \u201ccapacity\u201d to transport over water is in doubt.\nMoreover, borderline cases will always exist; they require\na method for resolution; we believe the method we have\nused is workable; and, unlike, say, an \u201canything that\nfloats\u201d test, it is consistent with statutory text, purpose,\nand precedent. Nor do we believe that the dissent\u2019s ap-\nproach would prove any more workable. For example,\nthe dissent suggests a relevant distinction between an own-\ner\u2019s \u201cclothes and personal effects\u201d and \u201clarge appliances\n(like an oven or a refrigerator).\u201d Post, at 8 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). But a transportation function need not\nturn on the size of the items in question, and we believe\nthe line between items being transported from place to\nplace (e.g., cargo) and items that are mere appurtenances\nis the one more likely to be relevant. Cf. Benedict, Ameri-\ncan Admiralty \u00a7222, at 121 (\u201cA ship is usually described as\nconsisting of the ship, her tackle, apparel, and furniture\n. . .\u201d).\n    Finally, the dissent and the Solicitor General (as amicus\nfor Lozman) argue that a remand is warranted for further\nfactfinding. See post, at 10\u201312; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 29\u201331. But neither the City nor Lozman\n14               LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes such a request. Brief for Respondent 18, 49, 52.\nAnd the only potentially relevant factual dispute the dis-\nsent points to is that the home suffered serious damage\nduring a tow. Post, at 10\u201311. But this would add support\nto our ultimate conclusion that this floating home was not\na vessel. We consequently see nothing to be gained by a\nremand.\n                               IV\n   Although we have focused on the phrase \u201ccapable of be-\ning used\u201d for transportation over water, the statute also\nincludes as a \u201cvessel\u201d a structure that is actually \u201cused\u201d\nfor that transportation. 1 U. S. C. \u00a73 (emphasis added).\nAnd the City argues that, irrespective of its design, Loz-\nman\u2019s floating home was actually so used. Brief for\nRespondent 32. We are not persuaded by its argument.\n   We are willing to assume for argument\u2019s sake that\nsometimes it is possible actually to use for water transpor-\ntation a structure that is in no practical way designed for\nthat purpose. See supra, at 12\u201313. But even so, the City\ncannot show the actual use for which it argues. Lozman\u2019s\nfloating home moved only under tow. Before its arrest, it\nmoved significant distances only twice in seven years.\nAnd when it moved, it carried, not passengers or cargo,\nbut at the very most (giving the benefit of any factual\nambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its owner\u2019s\npersonal effects, and personnel present to assure the\nhome\u2019s safety. 649 F. 3d, at 1268; Brief for Respondent 32;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338. This is far too little actual \u201cuse\u201d to\nbring the floating home within the terms of the statute.\nSee Evansville, 271 U.

Our prece-\ndents fully support the Court\u2019s reasoning that the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s test is overinclusive; that the subjective\nintentions of a watercraft\u2019s owner or designer play no role\nin the vessel analysis of 1 U. S. C. \u00a73; and that an ob-\njective assessment of a watercraft\u2019s purpose or function\ngoverns whether that structure is a vessel. The Court,\nhowever, creates a novel and unnecessary \u201creasonable\nobserver\u201d reformulation of these principles and errs in its\ndetermination, under this new standard, that the craft\nbefore us is not a vessel. Given the underdeveloped rec-\nord below, we should remand. Therefore, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   The relevant statute, 1 U. S.

S. 625, 627 (1887).\nAt its core, vessel status has always rested upon the objec-\ntive physical characteristics of a vessel (such as its struc-\nture, shape, and materials of construction), as well as its\nusage history. But over time, several important principles\nhave guided both this Court and the lower courts in de-\ntermining what kinds of watercraft fall properly within\nthe scope of admiralty jurisdiction.\n    Consider the most basic of requirements. For a water-\ncraft to be \u201cpractically capable\u201d of maritime transporta-\ntion, it must first be \u201ccapable\u201d of such transportation.\nOnly those structures that can simultaneously float and\ncarry people or things over water are even presumptively\nwithin \u00a73\u2019s reach. Stopping here, as the Eleventh Circuit\nessentially did, results in an overinclusive test. Section 3,\nafter all, does not drag every bit of floating and towable\nflotsam and jetsam into admiralty jurisdiction. Rather,\nthe terms \u201ccapable of being used\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d have real\nsignificance in our maritime jurisprudence.\n    \u201c[A] water craft is not \u2018capable of being used\u2019 for mari-\ntime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been\npermanently moored.\u201d Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494. So, to\ntake an obvious example, a floating bridge over water does\nnot constitute a vessel; such mooring is clearly permanent.\nCf. The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 216 (1867).

We held as much in Stewart\nwhen we concluded that a dredge was a vessel notwith-\nstanding that its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d was \u201cdredging rather\nthan transportation.\u201d Id., at 486, 495. So long as one\npurpose of a craft is transportation, whether of cargo or\npeople or both, \u00a73\u2019s practical capability requirement is\nsatisfied.\n   Certainly, difficult and marginal cases will arise.

So, for example, when we were confronted in Stew-\nart with the question whether a dredge is a \u00a73 vessel, we\ndid not commence with a clean slate; we instead sought\nguidance from previous cases that had confronted similar\nstructures. See id., at 490, and n. 5; see also Norton v.\nWarner Co., 321 U. S. 565, 571\u2013572 (1944) (likewise sur-\nveying earlier cases).\n   In sum, our precedents offer substantial guidance for\nhow objectively to determine whether a watercraft is\npractically capable of maritime transport and thus quali-\nfies as a \u00a73 vessel. First, the capacity to float and carry\nthings or people is an obvious prerequisite to vessel status.\nSecond, structures or ships that are permanently moored\nor fixed in place are not \u00a73 vessels. Likewise, structures\nthat are practically incapable of maritime transport are\nnot vessels, whether they are ships that have been altered\nso that they may no longer be put to sea, dead ships, or\nships removed from navigation for extended periods of\ntime. Third, those watercraft whose physical characteris-\ntics and usage history reveal no maritime transport pur-\npose or use are not \u00a73 vessels.\n                            II\n  The majority does not appear to disavow the legal prin-\nciples described above. The majority apparently accepts\nthat permanent mooring suffices to take a ship out of\nvessel status, ante, at 8, 12,2 and that \u201c[a] craft whose\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In discussing permanent mooring, as well as Stewart\u2019s rejection of\n\nprimary-purpose and state-of-transit tests for vessel status, Stewart v.\nDutra Constr.

This must mean, by negative impli-\ncation, that a permanently moored structure never falls within \u00a73\u2019s\n6                   LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nphysical characteristics and activities objectively evidence\na waterborne transportation purpose or function may still\nbe rendered a nonvessel by later physical alterations,\u201d\nante, at 12\u201313.3 No one argues that Lozman\u2019s craft was\npermanently moored, see App. 32 (describing the \u201cdeterio-\nrated\u201d ropes holding the craft in place), or that it had un-\ndergone physical alterations sufficient to take it out of\nvessel status, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 13 (Lozman\u2019s counsel\narguing that the craft was never a vessel in the first\nplace). Our precedents make clear that the Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s \u201canything that floats\u201d test is overinclusive and\nignores that purpose is a crucial factor in determining\nwhether a particular craft is or is not a vessel. Accord-\ningly, the majority is correct that determining whether\nLozman\u2019s craft is a vessel hinges on whether that craft\nhad any maritime transportation purpose or function.\n  The majority errs, though, in concluding that the pur-\npose component of the \u00a73 test is whether \u201ca reasonable\nobserver, looking to the [craft]\u2019s physical characteristics\nand activities, would not consider it to be designed to any\npractical degree for carrying people or things on water.\u201d\nAnte, at 1. This phrasing has never appeared in any of\nour cases and the majority\u2019s use of it, despite its seemingly\nobjective gloss, effectively (and erroneously) introduces a\nsubjective component into the vessel-status inquiry.\n  For one thing, in applying this test the majority points\nto some characteristics of Lozman\u2019s craft that have no\nrelationship to maritime transport, such as the style of the\ncraft\u2019s rooms or that \u201cthose inside those rooms looked out\nupon the world, not through water-tight portholes, but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndefinition.\n  3 Presumably, this encompasses those kinds of ships \u201cotherwise ren-\n\ndered practically incapable of transportation or movement.\u201d Stewart,\n543 U. S., at 494. That is, ships which have been altered so they cannot\ntravel the seas, dead ships, and ships removed from the water for an\nextended period of time.

In fact, they are not. Section 3 is focused on\nwhether a structure is \u201cused, or capable of being used, as\na means of transportation on water.\u201d By importing win-\ndows, doors, room style, and other esthetic criteria into the\n\u00a73 analysis, the majority gives our vessel test an \u201cI know it\nwhen I see it\u201d flavor. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197\n(1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). But that has never been\nnor should it be the test: A badly designed and unattrac-\ntive vessel is different from a structure that lacks any\n\u201cpractical capacity\u201d for maritime transport. In the major-\nity\u2019s eyes, the two appear to be one and the same.\n   The majority\u2019s treatment of the craft\u2019s past voyages is\nalso strange. The majority notes that Lozman\u2019s craft could\nbe and was, in fact, towed over long distances, including\nover 200 miles at one point. Ante, at 2\u20136. But the major-\nity determines that, given the design of Lozman\u2019s craft,\nthis is \u201cfar too little actual \u2018use\u2019 to bring the floating home\nwithin the terms of the statute.\u201d Ante, at 14. This is\nbecause \u201cwhen it moved, it carried, not passengers or\ncargo, but at the very most (giving the benefit of any\nfactual ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its\nowner\u2019s personal effects, and personnel present to assure\nthe home\u2019s safety.\u201d Ante, at 13\u201314.\n   I find this analysis confusing. The majority accepts that\nthe record indicates that Lozman\u2019s craft traveled hundreds\nof miles while \u201ccarrying people or things.\u201d Ante, at 1. But\nthen, in the same breath, the majority concludes that a\n\u201creasonable observer\u201d would nonetheless conclude that the\ncraft was not \u201cdesigned to any practical degree for carry-\ning people or things on water.\u201d Ibid. The majority fails to\nexplain how a craft that apparently did carry people and\nthings over water for long distances was not \u201cpractically\ncapable\u201d of maritime transport.\n8                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   This is not to say that a structure capable of such feats\nis necessarily a vessel. A craft like Lozman\u2019s might not\nbe a vessel, for example, if it could only carry its owner\u2019s\nclothes and personal effects, or if it is only capable of\ntransporting itself and its appurtenances. Jerome B. Gru-\nbart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S.\n527, 535 (1995) (\u201c[M]aritime law . . . ordinarily treats an\n\u2018appurtenance\u2019 attached to a vessel in navigable waters as\npart of the vessel itself \u201d). But if such a craft can carry\nlarge appliances (like an oven or a refrigerator) and all of\nthe other things we might find in a normal home in addi-\ntion to the occupants of that home, as the existing record\nsuggests Lozman\u2019s craft may have done, then it would\nseem to be much more like a mobile home (and therefore a\nvessel) than a firmly rooted residence. The simple truth is\nthat we know very little about the craft\u2019s capabilities and\nwhat did or did not happen on its various trips. By fo-\ncusing on the little we do know for certain about this craft\n(i.e., its windows, doors, and the style of its rooms) in\ndetermining whether it is a vessel, the majority renders\nthe \u00a73 inquiry opaque and unpredictable.\n   Indeed, the little we do know about Lozman\u2019s craft\nsuggests only that it was an unusual structure. A sur-\nveyor was unable to find any comparable craft for sale in the\nState of Florida. App. 43. Lozman\u2019s home was neither\nobviously a houseboat, as the majority describes such\nships, ante, at 5\u20136, nor clearly a floating home, ante, at\n10\u201311. See App. 13, 31, 79 (sale, lease, and surveying\ndocuments describing Lozman\u2019s craft as a \u201chouseboat\u201d).\nThe only clear difference that the majority identifies be-\ntween these two kinds of structures is that the former are\nself-propelled, while the latter are not. Ante, at 5\u20136. But\neven the majority recognizes that self-propulsion has\nnever been a prerequisite for vessel status. Ante, at 5\n(citing The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.

If\nwindows, doors, and other esthetic attributes are what\ntake Lozman\u2019s craft out of vessel status, then the major-\nity\u2019s test is completely malleable. If it is the craft\u2019s lack of\nself-propulsion, then the majority\u2019s test is unfaithful to our\nlongstanding precedents. See The Robert W. Parsons, 191\nU. S., at 30\u201331. If it is something else, then that some-\nthing is not apparent from the majority\u2019s opinion.\n   Worse still, in straining to find that Lozman\u2019s craft\nwas a floating home and therefore not a vessel, the major-\nity calls into question the conclusions of numerous lower\ncourts that have found houseboats that lacked self-\npropulsion to be \u00a73 vessels. See ante, at 9\u201310 (citing\nMiami River Boat Yard, Inc. v. 60\u2019 Houseboat, 390 F. 2d\n596, 597 (CA5 1968); Sea Village Marina, LLC v.

At most,\nsuch a remand would introduce a relatively short delay\nbefore finally ending the years-long battle between Loz-\nman and the city of Riviera Beach.\n  On the other hand, there is great harm in stretching the\nfacts below and overriding settled and likely correct lower\ncourt precedents to reach the unnecessary conclusion that\nLozman\u2019s craft was not a vessel. Without an objective\napplication of the \u00a73 standard, one that relies in a predict-\nable fashion only on those physical characteristics of a\ncraft that are related to maritime transport and use,\nparties will have no ex ante notion whether a particular\nship is a vessel. As a wide range of amici have cautioned\nus, numerous maritime industries rely heavily on clear\nand predictable legal rules for determining which ships\nare vessels.6 The majority\u2019s distorted application of our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 For example, without knowing whether a particular ship is a \u00a73\n\nvessel, it is impossible for lenders to know how properly to characterize\nit as collateral for a financing agreement because they do not know\nwhat remedies they will have recourse to in the event of a default.\nBrief for National Marine Bankers Assn. as Amicus Curiae 14\u201315.\nSimilarly, cities like Riviera Beach provide docking for crafts like\nLozman\u2019s on the assumption that such crafts actually are \u201cvessels,\u201d\nApp. 13\u201321 (Riviera Beach\u2019s wet-slip agreement referring to Lozman\u2019s\ncraft as a \u201cvessel,\u201d \u201cboat,\u201d or \u201chouseboat\u201d), that can be \u201cremove[d]\u201d upon\nshort notice, id., at 17 (requiring removal of the craft on three days\u2019\nnotice). The majority makes it impossible for these marinas to know\nwhether the \u201chouseboats\u201d that fill their slips are actually vessels and\nwhat remedies they can exercise in the event of a dispute. See id., at\n15 (\u201cIn addition to any other remedies provided for in this Agreement,\n12                  LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsettled law to the facts of this case frustrates these ends.\nMoreover, the majority\u2019s decision reaches well beyond rel-\natively insignificant boats like Lozman\u2019s craft, id., at 79\n(listing purchase price of Lozman\u2019s craft as $17,000),\nbecause it specifically disapproves of lower court decisions\ndealing with much larger ships, see ante, at 10 (question-\ning Holmes v. Atlantic Sounding Co., 437 F. 3d 441 (CA5\n2006) (finding a 140-foot-long and 40-foot-wide dormitory\nbarge with 50 beds to be a \u00a73 vessel)).\n                             IV\n  It is not clear that Lozman\u2019s craft is a \u00a73 vessel. It is\nclear, however, that we are not in a good position to make\nsuch a determination based on the limited record we pos-\nsess. The appropriate response is to remand the case\nfor further proceedings in light of the proper legal stand-\nard. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\u201331.\nThe Court resists this move and in its haste to christen\nLozman\u2019s craft a nonvessel delivers an analysis that will\nconfuse the lower courts and upset our longstanding admi-\nralty precedent. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Marina, as a provider of necessities to this vessel, has a maritime\nlien on the vessel and may bring a civil action in rem under 46 United\nStates Code 31342 in Federal Court, to arrest the vessel and enforce\nthe lien . . . \u201d (emphasis added)). Lozman\u2019s behavior over the years is\nemblematic of this problem. For example, in 2003, prior to his move to\nRiviera Beach, Lozman had his craft towed from one marina to another\nafter a dispute arose with the first marina and he was threatened with\neviction. App. 76\u201378. The possibility that a shipowner like Lozman\ncan depart so easily over water and go beyond the reach of a provider of\nnecessaries like the marina in response to a legal dispute is exactly the\nkind of problem that the Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46 U. S. C. \u00a731342,\nwas intended to address. See Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal\nOil & Gas Co. of Cal., 310 U. S. 268, 272\u2013273 (1940).\n",

CITY OF RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11\u2013626.     Argued October 1, 2012\u2014Decided January 15, 2013\nPetitioner Lozman\u2019s floating home was a house-like plywood structure\n  with empty bilge space underneath the main floor to keep it afloat.\n  He had it towed several times before deciding on a marina owned by\n  the city of Riviera Beach (City). After various disputes with Lozman\n  and unsuccessful efforts to evict him from the marina, the City\n  brought a federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating home,\n  seeking a lien for dockage fees and damages for trespass. Lozman\n  moved to dismiss the suit for lack of admiralty jurisdiction. The Dis-\n  trict Court found the floating home to be a \u201cvessel\u201d under the Rules of\n  Construction Act, which defines a \u201cvessel\u201d as including \u201cevery de-\n  scription of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable\n  of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a73,\n  concluded that admiralty jurisdiction was proper, and awarded the\n  City dockage fees and nominal damages. The Eleventh Circuit af-\n  firmed, agreeing that the home was a \u201cvessel\u201d since it was \u201ccapable\u201d\n  of movement over water despite petitioner\u2019s subjective intent to re-\n  main moored indefinitely.\nHeld:\n     1. This case is not moot. The District Court ordered the floating\n home sold, and the City purchased the home at auction and had it\n destroyed. Before the sale, the court ordered the City to post a bond\n to ensure Lozman could obtain monetary relief if he prevailed. P. 3.\n     2. Lozman\u2019s floating home is not a \u00a73 \u201cvessel.\u201d Pp. 3\u201315.\n        (a) The Eleventh Circuit found the home \u201ccapable of being used\n . . . as a means of transportation on water\u201d because it could float and\n proceed under tow and its shore connections did not render it incapa-\n ble of transportation. This interpretation is too broad. The definition\n of \u201ctransportation,\u201d the conveyance of persons or things from one\n2                      LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    place to another, must be applied in a practical way. Stewart v. Du-\n    tra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 496. Consequently, a structure does\n    not fall within the scope of the statutory phrase unless a reasonable\n    observer, looking to the home\u2019s physical characteristics and activities,\n    would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or\n    things over water. Pp. 3\u20135.\n         (b) But for the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman\u2019s home\n    suggests that it was designed to any practical degree to transport\n    persons or things over water. It had no steering mechanism, had an\n    unraked hull and rectangular bottom 10 inches below the water, and\n    had no capacity to generate or store electricity. It also lacked self-\n    propulsion, differing significantly from an ordinary houseboat.\n    Pp. 5\u20136.\n         (c) This view of the statute is consistent with its text, precedent,\n    and relevant purposes. The statute\u2019s language, read naturally, lends\n    itself to that interpretation: The term \u201ccontrivance\u201d refers to some-\n    thing \u201cemployed in contriving to effect a purpose\u201d; \u201ccraft\u201d explains\n    that purpose as \u201cwater carriage and transport\u201d; the addition of \u201cwa-\n    ter\u201d to \u201ccraft\u201d emphasizes the point; and the words, \u201cused, or capable\n    of being used, as a means of transportation on water,\u201d drive the point\n    home. Both Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v. Chero Cola\n    Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19, and Stewart, supra, support this conclu-\n    sion. Evansville involved a wharfboat floated next to a dock, used to\n    transfer cargo, and towed to harbor each winter; and Stewart in-\n    volved a dredge used to remove silt from the ocean floor, which car-\n    ried a captain and crew and could be navigated only by manipulating\n    anchors and cables or by being towed. Water transportation was not\n    the primary purpose of either structure; neither was in motion at rel-\n    evant times; and both were sometimes attached to the ocean bottom\n    or to land. However, Stewart\u2019s dredge, which was regularly, but not\n    primarily, used to transport workers and equipment over water, fell\n    within the statutory definition while Evansville\u2019s wharfboat, which\n    was not designed to, and did not, serve a transportation function, did\n    not. Lower court cases, on balance, also tend to support this conclu-\n    sion. Further, the purposes of major federal maritime statutes\u2014e.g.,\n    admiralty provisions provide special attachment procedures lest a\n    vessel avoid liability by sailing away, recognize that sailors face spe-\n    cial perils at sea, and encourage shipowners to engage in port-related\n    commerce\u2014reveal little reason to classify floating homes as \u201cvessels.\u201d\n    Finally, this conclusion is consistent with state laws in States where\n    floating home owners have congregated in communities. Pp. 6\u201311.\n         (d) Several important arguments made by the City and its amici\n    are unavailing. They argue that a purpose-based test may introduce\n    a subjective element into \u201cvessel\u201d determinations. But the Court has\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

They also argue against using criteria that are too abstract,\n  complex, or open-ended. While this Court\u2019s approach is neither per-\n  fectly precise nor always determinative, it is workable and consistent\n  and should offer guidance in a significant number of borderline cases.\n  And contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the Court sees nothing to be\n  gained by a remand. Pp. 11\u201314.\n       (e) The City\u2019s additional argument that Lozman\u2019s floating home\n  was actually used for transportation over water is similarly unper-\n  suasive.

S. C. \u00a73. The question before\nus is whether petitioner\u2019s floating home (which is not self-\npropelled) falls within the terms of that definition.\n  In answering that question we focus primarily upon the\nphrase \u201ccapable of being used.\u201d This term encompasses\n\u201cpractical\u201d possibilities, not \u201cmerely . . . theoretical\u201d ones.\nStewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 543 U.

And we consequently con-\nclude that the floating home is not a \u201cvessel.\u201d\n                               I\n  In 2002 Fane Lozman, petitioner, bought a 60-foot by\n12-foot floating home. App. 37, 71. The home consisted of\na house-like plywood structure with French doors on three\nsides. Id., at 38, 44. It contained a sitting room, bedroom,\n2                LOZMAN v.

(See Appendix, infra, for a photograph.)\nAfter buying the floating home, Lozman had it towed\nabout 200 miles to North Bay Village, Florida, where he\nmoored it and then twice more had it towed between\nnearby marinas.

Brief\nfor Respondent 5.\n   After various disputes with Lozman and unsuccessful\nefforts to evict him from the marina, the City brought\nthis federal admiralty lawsuit in rem against the floating\nhome. It sought a maritime lien for dockage fees and\ndamages for trespass. See Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46\nU. S.

Id., at 1267\u20131269.\n  Lozman sought certiorari. In light of uncertainty among\nthe Circuits about application of the term \u201ccapable\u201d we\ngranted his petition. Compare De La Rosa v. St. Charles\nGaming Co., 474 F. 3d 185, 187 (CA5 2006) (structure is\nnot a \u201cvessel\u201d where \u201cphysically,\u201d but only \u201ctheoretical[ly],\u201d\n\u201ccapable of sailing,\u201d and owner intends to moor it indef-\ninitely as floating casino), with Board of Comm\u2019rs of Or-\nleans Levee Dist. v.

The\nDistrict Court ordered the floating home sold to satisfy\nthe City\u2019s judgment. The City bought the home at public\nauction and subsequently had it destroyed. And, after the\nparties filed their merits briefs, we ordered further brief-\ning on the question of mootness in light of the home\u2019s\ndestruction. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). The parties now have\npointed out that, prior to the home\u2019s sale, the District\nCourt ordered the City to post a $25,000 bond \u201cto secure\nMr. Lozman\u2019s value in the vessel.\u201d 1 Record, Doc. 20, p. 2.\nThe bond ensures that Lozman can obtain monetary relief\nif he ultimately prevails. We consequently agree with the\nparties that the case is not moot.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  We focus primarily upon the statutory phrase \u201ccapable\nof being used . . . as a means of transportation on water.\u201d\n1 U. S. C. \u00a73. The Court of Appeals found that the home\n4                 LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwas \u201ccapable\u201d of transportation because it could float, it\ncould proceed under tow, and its shore connections (power\ncable, water hose, rope lines) did not \u201c \u2018rende[r]\u2019 \u201d it \u201c \u2018prac-\ntically incapable of transportation or movement.\u2019 \u201d 649\nF. 3d, at 1266 (quoting Belle of Orleans, supra, at 1312,\nin turn quoting Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494). At least for\nargument\u2019s sake we agree with the Court of Appeals about\nthe last-mentioned point, namely that Lozman\u2019s shore\nconnections did not \u201c \u2018render\u2019 \u201d the home \u201c \u2018practically inca-\npable of transportation.\u2019 \u201d But unlike the Eleventh Circuit,\nwe do not find these considerations (even when combined\nwith the home\u2019s other characteristics) sufficient to show\nthat Lozman\u2019s home was a \u201cvessel.\u201d\n   The Court of Appeals recognized that it had applied\nthe term \u201ccapable\u201d broadly. 649 F. 3d, at 1266. Indeed,\nit pointed with approval to language in an earlier case,\nBurks v. American River Transp. Co., 679 F. 2d 69 (1982),\nin which the Fifth Circuit said:\n    \u201c \u2018No doubt the three men in a tub would also fit with-\n    in our definition, and one probably could make a con-\n    vincing case for Jonah inside the whale.\u2019 \u201d 649 F. 3d,\n    at 1269 (brackets omitted) (quoting Burks, supra, at\n    75).\nBut the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation is too broad. Not\nevery floating structure is a \u201cvessel.\u201d To state the obvious,\na wooden washtub, a plastic dishpan, a swimming plat-\nform on pontoons, a large fishing net, a door taken off\nits hinges, or Pinocchio (when inside the whale) are not\n\u201cvessels,\u201d even if they are \u201cartificial contrivance[s]\u201d capable\nof floating, moving under tow, and incidentally carrying\neven a fair-sized item or two when they do so.

And we must apply this\ndefinition in a \u201cpractical,\u201d not a \u201ctheoretical,\u201d way. Stew-\nart, supra, at 496. Consequently, in our view a structure\ndoes not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase\nunless a reasonable observer, looking to the home\u2019s phys-\nical characteristics and activities, would consider it de-\nsigned to a practical degree for carrying people or things\nover water.\n                              B\n   Though our criterion is general, the facts of this case\nillustrate more specifically what we have in mind. But\nfor the fact that it floats, nothing about Lozman\u2019s home\nsuggests that it was designed to any practical degree to\ntransport persons or things over water. It had no rudder\nor other steering mechanism. 649 F. 3d, at 1269. Its hull\nwas unraked, ibid., and it had a rectangular bottom 10\ninches below the water. Brief for Petitioner 27; App. 37.\nIt had no special capacity to generate or store electricity\nbut could obtain that utility only through ongoing connec-\ntions with the land. Id., at 40. Its small rooms looked like\nordinary nonmaritime living quarters. And those inside\nthose rooms looked out upon the world, not through water-\ntight portholes, but through French doors or ordinary\nwindows. Id., at 44\u201366.\n   Although lack of self-propulsion is not dispositive, e.g.,\nThe Robert W. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 31 (1903), it may be\na relevant physical characteristic. And Lozman\u2019s home\ndiffers significantly from an ordinary houseboat in that it\nhas no ability to propel itself. Cf. 33 CFR \u00a7173.3 (2012)\n(\u201cHouseboat means a motorized vessel . . . designed pri-\nmarily for multi-purpose accommodation spaces with low\n6                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfreeboard and little or no foredeck or cockpit\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Lozman\u2019s home was able to travel over water\nonly by being towed. Prior to its arrest, that home\u2019s travel\nby tow over water took place on only four occasions over a\nperiod of seven years. Supra, at 2. And when the home\nwas towed a significant distance in 2006, the towing com-\npany had a second boat follow behind to prevent the home\nfrom swinging dangerously from side to side. App. 104.\n  The home has no other feature that might suggest a\ndesign to transport over water anything other than its\nown furnishings and related personal effects. In a word,\nwe can find nothing about the home that could lead a\nreasonable observer to consider it designed to a practical\ndegree for \u201ctransportation on water.\u201d\n                                C\n   Our view of the statute is consistent with its text, prece-\ndent, and relevant purposes. For one thing, the statute\u2019s\nlanguage, read naturally, lends itself to that interpreta-\ntion. We concede that the statute uses the word \u201cevery,\u201d\nreferring to \u201cevery description of watercraft or other artifi-\ncial contrivance.\u201d 1 U. S. C. \u00a73 (emphasis added). But\nthe term \u201ccontrivance\u201d refers to \u201csomething contrived for,\nor employed in contriving to effect a purpose.\u201d 3 OED 850\n(def. 7). The term \u201ccraft\u201d explains that purpose as \u201cwater\ncarriage and transport.\u201d Id., at 1104 (def. V(9)(b)) (de-\nfining \u201ccraft\u201d as a \u201cvesse[l] . . . for\u201d that purpose). The ad-\ndition of the word \u201cwater\u201d to \u201ccraft,\u201d yielding the term\n\u201cwatercraft,\u201d emphasizes the point. And the next few words,\n\u201cused, or capable of being used, as a means of transporta-\ntion on water,\u201d drive the point home.\n   For another thing, the bulk of precedent supports our\nconclusion. In Evansville & Bowling Green Packet Co. v.\nChero Cola Bottling Co., 271 U. S. 19 (1926), the Court\nheld that a wharfboat was not a \u201cvessel.\u201d The wharfboat\nfloated next to a dock; it was used to transfer cargo from\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nship to dock and ship to ship; and it was connected to the\ndock with cables, utility lines, and a ramp. Id., at 21. At\nthe same time, it was capable of being towed. And it\nwas towed each winter to a harbor to avoid river ice. Id.,\nat 20\u201321. The Court reasoned that, despite the annual\nmovement under tow, the wharfboat \u201cwas not used to\ncarry freight from one place to another,\u201d nor did it \u201cen-\ncounter perils of navigation to which craft used for trans-\nportation are exposed.\u201d Id., at 22. (See Appendix, infra,\nfor photograph of a period wharfboat).\n   The Court\u2019s reasoning in Stewart also supports our\nconclusion. We there considered the application of the\nstatutory definition to a dredge. 543 U. S., at 494. The\ndredge was \u201ca massive floating platform\u201d from which a\nsuspended clamshell bucket would \u201cremov[e] silt from the\nocean floor,\u201d depositing it \u201conto one of two scows\u201d floating\nalongside the dredge. Id., at 484. Like more traditional\n\u201cseagoing vessels,\u201d the dredge had, e.g., \u201ca captain and\ncrew, navigational lights, ballast tanks, and a crew dining\narea.\u201d Ibid. Unlike more ordinary vessels, it could navi-\ngate only by \u201cmanipulating its anchors and cables\u201d or by\nbeing towed. Ibid. Nonetheless it did move. In fact it\nmoved over water \u201cevery couple of hours.\u201d Id., at 485.\n   We held that the dredge was a \u201cvessel.\u201d We wrote that\n\u00a73\u2019s definition \u201cmerely codified the meaning that the term\n\u2018vessel\u2019 had acquired in general maritime law.\u201d Id., at 490.\nWe added that the question of the \u201cwatercraft\u2019s use \u2018as a\nmeans of transportation on water\u2019 is . . . practical,\u201d and not\n\u201cmerely . . . theoretical.\u201d Id., at 496. And we pointed to\ncases holding that dredges ordinarily \u201cserved a waterborne\ntransportation function,\u201d namely that \u201cin performing their\nwork they carried machinery, equipment, and crew over\nwater.\u201d Id., at 491\u2013492 (citing, e.g., Butler v. Ellis, 45\nF. 2d 951, 955 (CA4 1930)).\n   As the Court of Appeals pointed out, in Stewart we also\nwrote that \u00a73 \u201cdoes not require that a watercraft be used\n8                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprimarily for that [transportation] purpose,\u201d 543 U. S.,\nat 495; that a \u201cwatercraft need not be in motion to qualify\nas a vessel,\u201d ibid.; and that a structure may qualify as a\nvessel even if attached\u2014but not \u201cpermanently\u201d attached\u2014\nto the land or ocean floor. Id., at 493\u2013494. We did not\ntake these statements, however, as implying a universal\nset of sufficient conditions for application of the definition.\nRather, they say, and they mean, that the statutory defi-\nnition may (or may not) apply\u2014not that it automatically\nmust apply\u2014where a structure has some other primary\npurpose, where it is stationary at relevant times, and\nwhere it is attached\u2014but not permanently attached\u2014to\nland.\n   After all, a washtub is normally not a \u201cvessel\u201d though it\ndoes not have water transportation as its primary pur-\npose, it may be stationary much of the time, and it might\nbe attached\u2014but not permanently attached\u2014to land.\nMore to the point, water transportation was not the pri-\nmary purpose of either Stewart\u2019s dredge or Evansville\u2019s\nwharfboat; neither structure was \u201cin motion\u201d at relevant\ntimes; and both were sometimes attached (though not\npermanently attached) to the ocean bottom or to land.\nNonetheless Stewart\u2019s dredge fell within the statute\u2019s\ndefinition while Evansville\u2019s wharfboat did not.\n   The basic difference, we believe, is that the dredge was\nregularly, but not primarily, used (and designed in part to\nbe used) to transport workers and equipment over water\nwhile the wharfboat was not designed (to any practical\ndegree) to serve a transportation function and did not do\nso. Compare Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Co., 119 U. S. 625\n(1887) (floating drydock not a \u201cvessel\u201d because permanently\nfixed to wharf), with Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v.

For the reasons we have\nstated, we find such an approach inappropriate and incon-\nsistent with our precedents.\n   Further, our examination of the purposes of major fed-\neral maritime statutes reveals little reason to classify\nfloating homes as \u201cvessels.\u201d Admiralty law, for example,\nprovides special attachment procedures lest a vessel avoid\nliability by sailing away. 46 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a731341\u201331343 (2006\ned. and Supp. IV). Liability statutes such as the Jones Act\nrecognize that sailors face the special \u201c \u2018perils of the sea.\u2019 \u201d\nChandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354, 373 (1995)\n(referring to \u201c \u2018vessel[s] in navigation\u2019 \u201d). Certain admiralty\ntort doctrines can encourage shipowners to engage in\nport-related commerce. E.g., 46 U. S. C. \u00a730505; Executive\nJet Aviation, Inc. v. Cleveland, 409 U. S. 249, 269\u2013270\n(1972). And maritime safety statutes subject vessels to U. S.\nCoast Guard inspections. E.g., 46 U. S. C. \u00a73301.\n   Lozman, however, cannot easily escape liability by\nsailing away in his home. He faces no special sea dangers.\nHe does not significantly engage in port-related commerce.\nAnd the Solicitor General tells us that to adopt a version\nof the \u201canything that floats\u201d test would place unneces-\nsary and undesirable inspection burdens upon the Coast\nGuard. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29,\nn. 11.\n   Finally, our conclusion is consistent with state laws\nin States where floating home owners have congregated in\ncommunities.

Rev.\nCode Ann. \u00a790.58.270(5)(b)(ii) (Supp. 2012). A California\nstatute defines a floating home (for tax purposes) as \u201ca\nfloating structure\u201d that is \u201cdesigned and built to be used,\nor is modified to be used, as a stationary waterborne resi-\ndential dwelling,\u201d and which (unlike a typical houseboat),\nhas no independent power generation, and is dependent\non shore utilities. Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann.\n\u00a718075.55(d) (West 2006). These States, we are told, treat\nstructures that meet their \u201cfloating home\u201d definitions like\nordinary land-based homes rather than like vessels. Brief\nfor Seattle Floating Homes Association 2. Consistency of\ninterpretation of related state and federal laws is a virtue\nin that it helps to create simplicity making the law easier\nto understand and to follow for lawyers and for nonlaw-\nyers alike. And that consideration here supports our\nconclusion.\n                             D\n  The City and supporting amici make several important\narguments that warrant our response. First, they ar-\ngue against use of any purpose-based test lest we intro-\nduce into \u201cvessel\u201d determinations a subjective element\u2014\nnamely, the owner\u2019s intent. That element, they say, is\noften \u201cunverifiable\u201d and too easily manipulated. Its intro-\nduction would \u201cfoment unpredictability and invite games-\nmanship.\u201d Brief for Respondent 33.\n  We agree with the City about the need to eliminate the\nconsideration of evidence of subjective intent. But we\ncannot agree that the need requires abandonment of all\ncriteria based on \u201cpurpose.\u201d Cf. Stewart, 543 U. S., at 495\n(discussing transportation purpose). Indeed, it is difficult,\n12               LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nif not impossible, to determine the use of a human \u201ccon-\ntrivance\u201d without some consideration of human purposes.\nAt the same time, we have sought to avoid subjective\nelements, such as owner\u2019s intent, by permitting considera-\ntion only of objective evidence of a waterborne transporta-\ntion purpose. That is why we have referred to the views of\na reasonable observer. Supra, at 1. And it is why we have\nlooked to the physical attributes and behavior of the struc-\nture, as objective manifestations of any relevant purpose,\nand not to the subjective intent of the owner. Supra, at\n5\u20136. We note that various admiralty treatises refer to\nthe use of purpose-based tests without any suggestion that\nadministration of those tests has introduced too much\nsubjectivity into the vessel-determination process.        1\nBenedict on Admiralty \u00a7164; 1 Admiralty and Maritime\nLaw \u00a73\u20136.\n   Second, the City, with support of amici, argues against\nthe use of criteria that are too abstract, complex, or open-\nended. Brief for Respondent 28\u201329. A court\u2019s jurisdiction,\ne.g., admiralty jurisdiction, may turn on application of\nthe term \u201cvessel.\u201d And jurisdictional tests, often applied\nat the outset of a case, should be \u201cas simple as possible.\u201d\nHertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op.,\nat 1).\n   We agree with the last-mentioned sentiment. And we\nalso understand that our approach is neither perfectly pre-\ncise nor always determinative. Satisfaction of a design-\nbased or purpose-related criterion, for example, is not\nalways sufficient for application of the statutory word\n\u201cvessel.\u201d A craft whose physical characteristics and activi-\nties objectively evidence a waterborne transportation\npurpose or function may still be rendered a nonvessel by\nlater physical alterations. For example, an owner might\ntake a structure that is otherwise a vessel (even the Queen\nMary) and connect it permanently to the land for use, say,\nas a hotel. See Stewart, supra, at 493\u2013494. Further,\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nchanges over time may produce a new form, i.e., a newly\ndesigned structure\u2014in which case it may be the new de-\nsign that is relevant. See Kathriner v. Unisea, Inc., 975\nF. 2d 657, 660 (CA9 1992) (floating processing plant was\nno longer a vessel where a \u201clarge opening [had been] cut\ninto her hull\u201d).\n    Nor is satisfaction of the criterion always a necessary\ncondition, see Part IV, infra. It is conceivable that an\nowner might actually use a floating structure not designed\nto any practical degree for transportation as, say, a ferry\nboat, regularly transporting goods and persons over water.\n    Nonetheless, we believe the criterion we have used,\ntaken together with our example of its application here,\nshould offer guidance in a significant number of borderline\ncases where \u201ccapacity\u201d to transport over water is in doubt.\nMoreover, borderline cases will always exist; they require\na method for resolution; we believe the method we have\nused is workable; and, unlike, say, an \u201canything that\nfloats\u201d test, it is consistent with statutory text, purpose,\nand precedent. Nor do we believe that the dissent\u2019s ap-\nproach would prove any more workable. For example,\nthe dissent suggests a relevant distinction between an own-\ner\u2019s \u201cclothes and personal effects\u201d and \u201clarge appliances\n(like an oven or a refrigerator).\u201d Post, at 8 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.). But a transportation function need not\nturn on the size of the items in question, and we believe\nthe line between items being transported from place to\nplace (e.g., cargo) and items that are mere appurtenances\nis the one more likely to be relevant. Cf. Benedict, Ameri-\ncan Admiralty \u00a7222, at 121 (\u201cA ship is usually described as\nconsisting of the ship, her tackle, apparel, and furniture\n. . .\u201d).\n    Finally, the dissent and the Solicitor General (as amicus\nfor Lozman) argue that a remand is warranted for further\nfactfinding. See post, at 10\u201312; Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 29\u201331. But neither the City nor Lozman\n14               LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmakes such a request. Brief for Respondent 18, 49, 52.\nAnd the only potentially relevant factual dispute the dis-\nsent points to is that the home suffered serious damage\nduring a tow. Post, at 10\u201311. But this would add support\nto our ultimate conclusion that this floating home was not\na vessel. We consequently see nothing to be gained by a\nremand.\n                               IV\n   Although we have focused on the phrase \u201ccapable of be-\ning used\u201d for transportation over water, the statute also\nincludes as a \u201cvessel\u201d a structure that is actually \u201cused\u201d\nfor that transportation. 1 U. S. C. \u00a73 (emphasis added).\nAnd the City argues that, irrespective of its design, Loz-\nman\u2019s floating home was actually so used. Brief for\nRespondent 32. We are not persuaded by its argument.\n   We are willing to assume for argument\u2019s sake that\nsometimes it is possible actually to use for water transpor-\ntation a structure that is in no practical way designed for\nthat purpose. See supra, at 12\u201313. But even so, the City\ncannot show the actual use for which it argues. Lozman\u2019s\nfloating home moved only under tow. Before its arrest, it\nmoved significant distances only twice in seven years.\nAnd when it moved, it carried, not passengers or cargo,\nbut at the very most (giving the benefit of any factual\nambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its owner\u2019s\npersonal effects, and personnel present to assure the\nhome\u2019s safety. 649 F. 3d, at 1268; Brief for Respondent 32;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 37\u201338. This is far too little actual \u201cuse\u201d to\nbring the floating home within the terms of the statute.\nSee Evansville, 271 U.

THE CITY OF\n\n           RIVIERA BEACH, FLORIDA\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [January 15, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY\njoins, dissenting.\n   I agree with much of the Court\u2019s reasoning. Our prece-\ndents fully support the Court\u2019s reasoning that the Elev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s test is overinclusive; that the subjective\nintentions of a watercraft\u2019s owner or designer play no role\nin the vessel analysis of 1 U. S. C. \u00a73; and that an ob-\njective assessment of a watercraft\u2019s purpose or function\ngoverns whether that structure is a vessel. The Court,\nhowever, creates a novel and unnecessary \u201creasonable\nobserver\u201d reformulation of these principles and errs in its\ndetermination, under this new standard, that the craft\nbefore us is not a vessel. Given the underdeveloped rec-\nord below, we should remand. Therefore, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   The relevant statute, 1 U. S. C. \u00a73, \u201csweeps broadly.\u201d\nStewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 494 (2005). It\nprovides that \u201c[t]he word \u2018vessel\u2019 includes every descrip-\ntion of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or\ncapable of being used, as a means of transportation on\nwater.\u201d This broad phrasing flows from admiralty law\u2019s\nlong recognition that vessels come in many shapes and\nsizes. See E. Benedict, American Admiralty \u00a7218, p. 121\n2                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n(1870 ed.) (\u201c[V]essel, is a general word, many times used\nfor any kind of navigation\u201d); M. Cohen, Admiralty Juris-\ndiction, Law, and Practice 232 (1883) (\u201c[T]he term \u2018ves-\nsel\u2019 shall be understood to comprehend every description of\nvessel navigating on any sea or channel, lake or river\n. . . \u201d).\n    Our test for vessel status has remained the same for\ndecades: \u201cUnder \u00a73, a \u2018vessel\u2019 is any watercraft practically\ncapable of maritime transportation . . . .\u201d Stewart, 543\nU.

S. 625, 627 (1887).\nAt its core, vessel status has always rested upon the objec-\ntive physical characteristics of a vessel (such as its struc-\nture, shape, and materials of construction), as well as its\nusage history. But over time, several important principles\nhave guided both this Court and the lower courts in de-\ntermining what kinds of watercraft fall properly within\nthe scope of admiralty jurisdiction.\n    Consider the most basic of requirements. For a water-\ncraft to be \u201cpractically capable\u201d of maritime transporta-\ntion, it must first be \u201ccapable\u201d of such transportation.\nOnly those structures that can simultaneously float and\ncarry people or things over water are even presumptively\nwithin \u00a73\u2019s reach. Stopping here, as the Eleventh Circuit\nessentially did, results in an overinclusive test. Section 3,\nafter all, does not drag every bit of floating and towable\nflotsam and jetsam into admiralty jurisdiction. Rather,\nthe terms \u201ccapable of being used\u201d and \u201cpractical\u201d have real\nsignificance in our maritime jurisprudence.\n    \u201c[A] water craft is not \u2018capable of being used\u2019 for mari-\ntime transport in any meaningful sense if it has been\npermanently moored.\u201d Stewart, 543 U. S., at 494. So, to\ntake an obvious example, a floating bridge over water does\nnot constitute a vessel; such mooring is clearly permanent.\nCf.

Put\nplainly, structures \u201cpermanently affixed to shore or rest-\ning on the ocean floor,\u201d Stewart, 543 U.

Take the easiest\ncase, a vessel whose physical characteristics have been so\naltered as to make waterborne transportation a practical\nimpossibility. Ibid.

She was undergoing major repairs and\ncomplete renovation . . . \u201d).\n   Finally, our maritime jurisprudence excludes from ves-\nsel status those floating structures that, based on their\nphysical characteristics, do not \u201ctransport people, freight,\nor cargo from place to place\u201d as one of their purposes.\nStewart, 543 U. S., at 493. \u201cPurpose,\u201d in this context,\nis determined solely by an objective inquiry into a craft\u2019s\nfunction. \u201c[N]either size, form, equipment nor means of\npropulsion are determinative factors upon the question of\n[vessel status],\u201d though all may be considered. The Robert\nW. Parsons, 191 U. S. 17, 30 (1903). Moreover, in as-\nsessing a particular structure\u2019s function, we have consis-\ntently examined its past and present activities. Stewart,\n543 U. S., at 495; Cope, 119 U. S., at 627. Of course, a\nseaborne craft is not excluded from vessel status simply\nbecause its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d is not maritime transport.\nStewart, 543 U. S., at 497. We held as much in Stewart\nwhen we concluded that a dredge was a vessel notwith-\nstanding that its \u201cprimary purpose\u201d was \u201cdredging rather\nthan transportation.\u201d Id., at 486, 495. So long as one\npurpose of a craft is transportation, whether of cargo or\npeople or both, \u00a73\u2019s practical capability requirement is\nsatisfied.\n   Certainly, difficult and marginal cases will arise.

So, for example, when we were confronted in Stew-\nart with the question whether a dredge is a \u00a73 vessel, we\ndid not commence with a clean slate; we instead sought\nguidance from previous cases that had confronted similar\nstructures. See id., at 490, and n. 5; see also Norton v.\nWarner Co., 321 U. S. 565, 571\u2013572 (1944) (likewise sur-\nveying earlier cases).\n   In sum, our precedents offer substantial guidance for\nhow objectively to determine whether a watercraft is\npractically capable of maritime transport and thus quali-\nfies as a \u00a73 vessel. First, the capacity to float and carry\nthings or people is an obvious prerequisite to vessel status.\nSecond, structures or ships that are permanently moored\nor fixed in place are not \u00a73 vessels. Likewise, structures\nthat are practically incapable of maritime transport are\nnot vessels, whether they are ships that have been altered\nso that they may no longer be put to sea, dead ships, or\nships removed from navigation for extended periods of\ntime. Third, those watercraft whose physical characteris-\ntics and usage history reveal no maritime transport pur-\npose or use are not \u00a73 vessels.\n                            II\n  The majority does not appear to disavow the legal prin-\nciples described above. The majority apparently accepts\nthat permanent mooring suffices to take a ship out of\nvessel status, ante, at 8, 12,2 and that \u201c[a] craft whose\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In discussing permanent mooring, as well as Stewart\u2019s rejection of\n\nprimary-purpose and state-of-transit tests for vessel status, Stewart v.\nDutra Constr. Co., 543 U. S. 481, 495 (2005), the majority states that\nour holdings \u201csay, and they mean, that the statutory definition [given\nby \u00a73] may (or may not) apply\u2014not that it automatically must apply\u2014\nwhere a structure has some other primary purpose, where it is station-\nary at relevant times, and where it is attached\u2014but not permanently\nattached\u2014to land.\u201d Ante, at 8. This must mean, by negative impli-\ncation, that a permanently moored structure never falls within \u00a73\u2019s\n6                   LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nphysical characteristics and activities objectively evidence\na waterborne transportation purpose or function may still\nbe rendered a nonvessel by later physical alterations,\u201d\nante, at 12\u201313.3 No one argues that Lozman\u2019s craft was\npermanently moored, see App. 32 (describing the \u201cdeterio-\nrated\u201d ropes holding the craft in place), or that it had un-\ndergone physical alterations sufficient to take it out of\nvessel status, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 13 (Lozman\u2019s counsel\narguing that the craft was never a vessel in the first\nplace). Our precedents make clear that the Eleventh\nCircuit\u2019s \u201canything that floats\u201d test is overinclusive and\nignores that purpose is a crucial factor in determining\nwhether a particular craft is or is not a vessel. Accord-\ningly, the majority is correct that determining whether\nLozman\u2019s craft is a vessel hinges on whether that craft\nhad any maritime transportation purpose or function.\n  The majority errs, though, in concluding that the pur-\npose component of the \u00a73 test is whether \u201ca reasonable\nobserver, looking to the [craft]\u2019s physical characteristics\nand activities, would not consider it to be designed to any\npractical degree for carrying people or things on water.\u201d\nAnte, at 1. This phrasing has never appeared in any of\nour cases and the majority\u2019s use of it, despite its seemingly\nobjective gloss, effectively (and erroneously) introduces a\nsubjective component into the vessel-status inquiry.\n  For one thing, in applying this test the majority points\nto some characteristics of Lozman\u2019s craft that have no\nrelationship to maritime transport, such as the style of the\ncraft\u2019s rooms or that \u201cthose inside those rooms looked out\nupon the world, not through water-tight portholes, but\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndefinition.\n  3 Presumably, this encompasses those kinds of ships \u201cotherwise ren-\n\ndered practically incapable of transportation or movement.\u201d Stewart,\n543 U. S., at 494. That is, ships which have been altered so they cannot\ntravel the seas, dead ships, and ships removed from the water for an\nextended period of time.

In fact, they are not. Section 3 is focused on\nwhether a structure is \u201cused, or capable of being used, as\na means of transportation on water.\u201d By importing win-\ndows, doors, room style, and other esthetic criteria into the\n\u00a73 analysis, the majority gives our vessel test an \u201cI know it\nwhen I see it\u201d flavor. Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197\n(1964) (Stewart, J., concurring). But that has never been\nnor should it be the test: A badly designed and unattrac-\ntive vessel is different from a structure that lacks any\n\u201cpractical capacity\u201d for maritime transport. In the major-\nity\u2019s eyes, the two appear to be one and the same.\n   The majority\u2019s treatment of the craft\u2019s past voyages is\nalso strange. The majority notes that Lozman\u2019s craft could\nbe and was, in fact, towed over long distances, including\nover 200 miles at one point. Ante, at 2\u20136. But the major-\nity determines that, given the design of Lozman\u2019s craft,\nthis is \u201cfar too little actual \u2018use\u2019 to bring the floating home\nwithin the terms of the statute.\u201d Ante, at 14. This is\nbecause \u201cwhen it moved, it carried, not passengers or\ncargo, but at the very most (giving the benefit of any\nfactual ambiguity to the City) only its own furnishings, its\nowner\u2019s personal effects, and personnel present to assure\nthe home\u2019s safety.\u201d Ante, at 13\u201314.\n   I find this analysis confusing. The majority accepts that\nthe record indicates that Lozman\u2019s craft traveled hundreds\nof miles while \u201ccarrying people or things.\u201d Ante, at 1. But\nthen, in the same breath, the majority concludes that a\n\u201creasonable observer\u201d would nonetheless conclude that the\ncraft was not \u201cdesigned to any practical degree for carry-\ning people or things on water.\u201d Ibid. The majority fails to\nexplain how a craft that apparently did carry people and\nthings over water for long distances was not \u201cpractically\ncapable\u201d of maritime transport.\n8                LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   This is not to say that a structure capable of such feats\nis necessarily a vessel. A craft like Lozman\u2019s might not\nbe a vessel, for example, if it could only carry its owner\u2019s\nclothes and personal effects, or if it is only capable of\ntransporting itself and its appurtenances. Jerome B. Gru-\nbart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U. S.\n527, 535 (1995) (\u201c[M]aritime law . . . ordinarily treats an\n\u2018appurtenance\u2019 attached to a vessel in navigable waters as\npart of the vessel itself \u201d). But if such a craft can carry\nlarge appliances (like an oven or a refrigerator) and all of\nthe other things we might find in a normal home in addi-\ntion to the occupants of that home, as the existing record\nsuggests Lozman\u2019s craft may have done, then it would\nseem to be much more like a mobile home (and therefore a\nvessel) than a firmly rooted residence. The simple truth is\nthat we know very little about the craft\u2019s capabilities and\nwhat did or did not happen on its various trips. By fo-\ncusing on the little we do know for certain about this craft\n(i.e., its windows, doors, and the style of its rooms) in\ndetermining whether it is a vessel, the majority renders\nthe \u00a73 inquiry opaque and unpredictable.\n   Indeed, the little we do know about Lozman\u2019s craft\nsuggests only that it was an unusual structure. A sur-\nveyor was unable to find any comparable craft for sale in the\nState of Florida. App. 43. Lozman\u2019s home was neither\nobviously a houseboat, as the majority describes such\nships, ante, at 5\u20136, nor clearly a floating home, ante, at\n10\u201311. See App. 13, 31, 79 (sale, lease, and surveying\ndocuments describing Lozman\u2019s craft as a \u201chouseboat\u201d).\nThe only clear difference that the majority identifies be-\ntween these two kinds of structures is that the former are\nself-propelled, while the latter are not. Ante, at 5\u20136. But\neven the majority recognizes that self-propulsion has\nnever been a prerequisite for vessel status. Ante, at 5\n(citing The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.

If\nwindows, doors, and other esthetic attributes are what\ntake Lozman\u2019s craft out of vessel status, then the major-\nity\u2019s test is completely malleable. If it is the craft\u2019s lack of\nself-propulsion, then the majority\u2019s test is unfaithful to our\nlongstanding precedents. See The Robert W. Parsons, 191\nU. S., at 30\u201331. If it is something else, then that some-\nthing is not apparent from the majority\u2019s opinion.\n   Worse still, in straining to find that Lozman\u2019s craft\nwas a floating home and therefore not a vessel, the major-\nity calls into question the conclusions of numerous lower\ncourts that have found houseboats that lacked self-\npropulsion to be \u00a73 vessels.

Their holdings are consistent with older\ncases, see, e.g., The Ark, 17 F. 2d 446, 447 (SD Fla. 1926),\nand the crafts at issue in these cases have been widely\naccepted as vessels by most treatises in this area, see 1 S.\nFriedell, Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7164, p. 10\u20136, n. 2 (7th ed.\nrev. 2012); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty & Maritime Law\n\u00a73\u20136, p. 153, n. 10 (5th ed. 2011); 1 R. Force & M. Norris,\nThe Law of Seamen \u00a72:12, p. 2\u201382 (5th ed. 2003). The\nmajority\u2019s suggestion that rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\ntest necessitates jettisoning these other precedents is\nsimply wrong. And, in its rejection, the majority works\nreal damage to what has long been a settled area of mari-\ntime law.5\n                          III\n  With a more developed record, Lozman\u2019s craft might be\ndistinguished from the houseboats in those lower court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The majority\u2019s invocation of two state environmental and tax stat-\n\nutes as a reason to reject this well-established lower court precedent\nis particularly misguided. See ante, at 10\u201311. We have repeatedly\nemphasized that the \u201cregulation of maritime vessels\u201d is a \u201cuniquely\nfederal are[a] of regulation.\u201d Chamber of Commerce of United States\nof America v. Whiting, 563 U. S. __, __ (2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op.,\nat 19) (emphasis added); see also United States v. Locke, 529 U. S. 89,\n99 (2000) (explaining that \u201cthe federal interest [in regulating interstate\nnavigation] has been manifest since the beginning of our Republic and\nis now well established\u201d). Our previous cases did not turn to state law\nin determining whether a given craft is a vessel. There are no good\nreasons to do so now.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    11\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncases just discussed. For example, if Lozman\u2019s craft\u2019s\nprevious voyages caused it serious damage, then that\nwould strongly suggest that it lacked a maritime trans-\nportation purpose or function. There is no harm in re-\nmanding the case for further factfinding along the lines\ndescribed above, cautioning the lower courts to be aware\nthat features of Lozman\u2019s \u201cincomparable\u201d craft, see App. 43,\nmay distinguish it from previous precedents. At most,\nsuch a remand would introduce a relatively short delay\nbefore finally ending the years-long battle between Loz-\nman and the city of Riviera Beach.\n  On the other hand, there is great harm in stretching the\nfacts below and overriding settled and likely correct lower\ncourt precedents to reach the unnecessary conclusion that\nLozman\u2019s craft was not a vessel. Without an objective\napplication of the \u00a73 standard, one that relies in a predict-\nable fashion only on those physical characteristics of a\ncraft that are related to maritime transport and use,\nparties will have no ex ante notion whether a particular\nship is a vessel. As a wide range of amici have cautioned\nus, numerous maritime industries rely heavily on clear\nand predictable legal rules for determining which ships\nare vessels.6 The majority\u2019s distorted application of our\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 For example, without knowing whether a particular ship is a \u00a73\n\nvessel, it is impossible for lenders to know how properly to characterize\nit as collateral for a financing agreement because they do not know\nwhat remedies they will have recourse to in the event of a default.\nBrief for National Marine Bankers Assn. as Amicus Curiae 14\u201315.\nSimilarly, cities like Riviera Beach provide docking for crafts like\nLozman\u2019s on the assumption that such crafts actually are \u201cvessels,\u201d\nApp. 13\u201321 (Riviera Beach\u2019s wet-slip agreement referring to Lozman\u2019s\ncraft as a \u201cvessel,\u201d \u201cboat,\u201d or \u201chouseboat\u201d), that can be \u201cremove[d]\u201d upon\nshort notice, id., at 17 (requiring removal of the craft on three days\u2019\nnotice). The majority makes it impossible for these marinas to know\nwhether the \u201chouseboats\u201d that fill their slips are actually vessels and\nwhat remedies they can exercise in the event of a dispute. See id., at\n15 (\u201cIn addition to any other remedies provided for in this Agreement,\n12                  LOZMAN v. RIVIERA BEACH\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsettled law to the facts of this case frustrates these ends.\nMoreover, the majority\u2019s decision reaches well beyond rel-\natively insignificant boats like Lozman\u2019s craft, id., at 79\n(listing purchase price of Lozman\u2019s craft as $17,000),\nbecause it specifically disapproves of lower court decisions\ndealing with much larger ships, see ante, at 10 (question-\ning Holmes v. Atlantic Sounding Co., 437 F. 3d 441 (CA5\n2006) (finding a 140-foot-long and 40-foot-wide dormitory\nbarge with 50 beds to be a \u00a73 vessel)).\n                             IV\n  It is not clear that Lozman\u2019s craft is a \u00a73 vessel. It is\nclear, however, that we are not in a good position to make\nsuch a determination based on the limited record we pos-\nsess. The appropriate response is to remand the case\nfor further proceedings in light of the proper legal stand-\nard. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29\u201331.\nThe Court resists this move and in its haste to christen\nLozman\u2019s craft a nonvessel delivers an analysis that will\nconfuse the lower courts and upset our longstanding admi-\nralty precedent. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Marina, as a provider of necessities to this vessel, has a maritime\nlien on the vessel and may bring a civil action in rem under 46 United\nStates Code 31342 in Federal Court, to arrest the vessel and enforce\nthe lien . . . \u201d (emphasis added)). Lozman\u2019s behavior over the years is\nemblematic of this problem. For example, in 2003, prior to his move to\nRiviera Beach, Lozman had his craft towed from one marina to another\nafter a dispute arose with the first marina and he was threatened with\neviction. App. 76\u201378. The possibility that a shipowner like Lozman\ncan depart so easily over water and go beyond the reach of a provider of\nnecessaries like the marina in response to a legal dispute is exactly the\nkind of problem that the Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46 U. S. C. \u00a731342,\nwas intended to address. See Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal\nOil & Gas Co. of Cal., 310 U. S. 268, 272\u2013273 (1940).\n</pre>",
