HARRIS\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n  No. 11–817.      Argued October 31, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013\nOfficer Wheetley pulled over respondent Harris for a routine traffic\n  stop. Observing Harris’s nervousness and an open beer can, Wheet-\n  ley sought consent to search Harris’s truck. When Harris refused,\n  Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo.\n  The dog alerted at the driver’s-side door handle, leading Wheetley to\n  conclude that he had probable cause for a search. That search turned\n  up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephed-\n  rine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine.\n  Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those in-\n  gredients. In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo\n  again alerted on Harris’s truck but nothing of interest was found. At\n  a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldo’s exten-\n  sive training in drug detection. Harris’s attorney did not contest the\n  quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldo’s certification and\n  performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harris’s\n  truck. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida\n  Supreme Court reversed. It held that a wide array of evidence was\n  always necessary to establish probable cause, including field-\n  performance records showing how many times the dog has falsely\n  alerted. If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he\n  could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator\n  of drugs.\nHeld: Because training and testing records supported Aldo’s reliability\n in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that evidence,\n Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris’s truck. Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) In testing whether an officer has probable cause to conduct a\n search, all that is required is the kind of “fair probability” on which\n “reasonable and prudent [people] act.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.\n 213, 235. To evaluate whether the State has met this practical and\n2                          FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    common-sensical standard, this Court has consistently looked to the\n    totality of the circumstances and rejected rigid rules, bright-line\n    tests, and mechanistic inquiries. Ibid.\n       The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established approach by\n    creating a strict evidentiary checklist to assess a drug-detection dog’s\n    reliability. Requiring the State to introduce comprehensive docu-\n    mentation of the dog’s prior hits and misses in the field, and holding\n    that absent field records will preclude a finding of probable cause no\n    matter how much other proof the State offers, is the antithesis of a\n    totality-of-the-circumstances approach. This is made worse by the\n    State Supreme Court’s treatment of field-performance records as the\n    evidentiary gold standard when, in fact, such data may not capture a\n    dog’s false negatives or may markedly overstate a dog’s false posi-\n    tives. Such inaccuracies do not taint records of a dog’s performance\n    in standard training and certification settings, making that perfor-\n    mance a better measure of a dog’s reliability. Field records may\n    sometimes be relevant, but the court should evaluate all the evi-\n    dence, and should not prescribe an inflexible set of requirements.\n       Under the correct approach, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a\n    dog’s alert should proceed much like any other, with the court allow-\n    ing the parties to make their best case and evaluating the totality of\n    the circumstances. If the State has produced proof from controlled\n    settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the de-\n    fendant has not contested that showing, the court should find proba-\n    ble cause. But a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge\n    such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by cross-examining the\n    testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.\n    The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed or\n    too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert. The court\n    should then consider all the evidence and apply the usual test for\n    probable cause—whether all the facts surrounding the alert, viewed\n    through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent\n    person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a\n    crime. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) The record in this case amply supported the trial court’s deter-\n    mination that Aldo’s alert gave Wheetley probable cause to search\n    the truck. The State introduced substantial evidence of Aldo’s train-\n    ing and his proficiency in finding drugs. Harris declined to challenge\n    any aspect of that training or testing in the trial court, and the Court\n    does not consider such arguments when they are presented for this\n    first time in this Court. Harris principally relied below on Wheetley’s\n    failure to find any substance that Aldo was trained to detect. That\n    infers too much from the failure of a particular alert to lead to drugs,\n    and did not rebut the State’s evidence from recent training and test-\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

We think that de-\nmand inconsistent with the “flexible, common-sense\nstandard” of probable cause. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.\n213, 239 (1983).\n                             I\n   William Wheetley is a K–9 Officer in the Liberty County,\nFlorida Sheriff ’s Office. On June 24, 2006, he was on a\nroutine patrol with Aldo, a German shepherd trained to\ndetect certain narcotics (methamphetamine, marijuana,\ncocaine, heroin, and ecstasy). Wheetley pulled over re-\nspondent Clayton Harris’s truck because it had an expired\nlicense plate. On approaching the driver’s-side door,\nWheetley saw that Harris was “visibly nervous,” unable to\nsit still, shaking, and breathing rapidly. Wheetley also\nnoticed an open can of beer in the truck’s cup holder. App.\n2                    FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n62. Wheetley asked Harris for consent to search the truck,\nbut Harris refused. At that point, Wheetley retrieved Aldo\nfrom the patrol car and walked him around Harris’s truck\nfor a “free air sniff.” Id., at 63. Aldo alerted at the\ndriver’s-side door handle—signaling, through a distinctive\nset of behaviors, that he smelled drugs there.\n  Wheetley concluded, based principally on Aldo’s alert,\nthat he had probable cause to search the truck. His search\ndid not turn up any of the drugs Aldo was trained to de-\ntect. But it did reveal 200 loose pseudoephedrine pills,\n8,000 matches, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, two contain-\ners of antifreeze, and a coffee filter full of iodine crystals—\nall ingredients for making methamphetamine. Wheetley\naccordingly arrested Harris, who admitted after proper\nMiranda warnings that he routinely “cooked” metham-\nphetamine at his house and could not go “more than a few\ndays without using” it. Id., at 68. The State charged\nHarris with possessing pseudoephedrine for use in manu-\nfacturing methamphetamine.\n  While out on bail, Harris had another run-in with\nWheetley and Aldo. This time, Wheetley pulled Harris\nover for a broken brake light. Aldo again sniffed the\ntruck’s exterior, and again alerted at the driver’s-side door\nhandle. Wheetley once more searched the truck, but on\nthis occasion discovered nothing of interest.\n  Harris moved to suppress the evidence found in his\ntruck on the ground that Aldo’s alert had not given Wheet-\nley probable cause for a search. At the hearing on that\nmotion, Wheetley testified about both his and Aldo’s train-\ning in drug detection. See id., at 52–82. In 2004, Wheet-\nley (and a different dog) completed a 160-hour course in\nnarcotics detection offered by the Dothan, Alabama Police\nDepartment, while Aldo (and a different handler) completed\na similar, 120-hour course given by the Apopka, Florida\nPolice Department. That same year, Aldo received a one-\nyear certification from Drug Beat, a private company that\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecializes in testing and certifying K–9 dogs. Wheetley\nand Aldo teamed up in 2005 and went through another,\n40-hour refresher course in Dothan together. They also\ndid four hours of training exercises each week to maintain\ntheir skills. Wheetley would hide drugs in certain ve-\nhicles or buildings while leaving others “blank” to deter-\nmine whether Aldo alerted at the right places. Id., at 57.\nAccording to Wheetley, Aldo’s performance in those exer-\ncises was “really good.” Id., at 60. The State introduced\n“Monthly Canine Detection Training Logs” consistent with\nthat testimony: They showed that Aldo always found\nhidden drugs and that he performed “satisfactorily” (the\nhigher of two possible assessments) on each day of train-\ning. Id., at 109–116.\n   On cross-examination, Harris’s attorney chose not to\ncontest the quality of Aldo’s or Wheetley’s training. She\nfocused instead on Aldo’s certification and his performance\nin the field, particularly the two stops of Harris’s truck.\nWheetley conceded that the certification (which, he noted,\nFlorida law did not require) had expired the year before\nhe pulled Harris over. See id., at 70–71. Wheetley also\nacknowledged that he did not keep complete records of\nAldo’s performance in traffic stops or other field work;\ninstead, he maintained records only of alerts resulting in\narrests. See id., at 71–72, 74. But Wheetley defended\nAldo’s two alerts to Harris’s seemingly narcotics-free\ntruck: According to Wheetley, Harris probably transferred\nthe odor of methamphetamine to the door handle, and\nAldo responded to that “residual odor.” Id., at 80.\n   The trial court concluded that Wheetley had probable\ncause to search Harris’s truck and so denied the motion to\nsuppress. Harris then entered a no-contest plea while\nreserving the right to appeal the trial court’s ruling. An\nintermediate state court summarily affirmed.

HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWheetley lacked probable cause to search Harris’s vehicle\nunder the Fourth Amendment. “[W]hen a dog alerts,” the\ncourt wrote, “the fact that the dog has been trained and\ncertified is simply not enough to establish probable cause.”\n71 So. 3d, at 767. To demonstrate a dog’s reliability, the\nState needed to produce a wider array of evidence:\n    “[T]he State must present . . . the dog’s training and\n    certification records, an explanation of the meaning of\n    the particular training and certification, field perfor-\n    mance records (including any unverified alerts), and\n    evidence concerning the experience and training of the\n    officer handling the dog, as well as any other objective\n    evidence known to the officer about the dog’s reliabil-\n    ity.” Id., at 775.\nThe court particularly stressed the need for “evidence of\nthe dog’s performance history,” including records showing\n“how often the dog has alerted in the field without illegal\ncontraband having been found.” Id., at 769. That data,\nthe court stated, could help to expose such problems as a\nhandler’s tendency (conscious or not) to “cue [a] dog to\nalert” and “a dog’s inability to distinguish between resid-\nual odors and actual drugs.” Id., at 769, 774. Accordingly,\nan officer like Wheetley who did not keep full records of\nhis dog’s field performance could never have the requisite\ncause to think “that the dog is a reliable indicator of\ndrugs.” Id., at 773.\n   Judge Canady dissented, maintaining that the major-\nity’s “elaborate and inflexible evidentiary requirements”\nwent beyond the demands of probable cause. Id., at 775.\nHe would have affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the\nstrength of Aldo’s training history and Harris’s “fail[ure]\nto present any evidence challenging” it.

Texas v. Brown, 460\nU. S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion) (quoting Carroll v.\nUnited States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)); see Safford\nUnified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. 364, 370–\n371 (2009). The test for probable cause is not reducible to\n“precise definition or quantification.” Maryland v. Pringle,\n540 U. S. 366, 371 (2003). “Finely tuned standards such\nas proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance\nof the evidence . . . have no place in the [probable-cause]\ndecision.” Gates, 462 U. S., at 235. All we have required\nis the kind of “fair probability” on which “reasonable and\nprudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.” Id., at 238,\n231 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In evaluating whether the State has met this practical\nand common-sensical standard, we have consistently\nlooked to the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g., Prin-\ngle, 540 U. S., at 371; Gates, 462 U. S., at 232; Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949). We have rejected\nrigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries in\nfavor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach. In\nGates, for example, we abandoned our old test for as-\nsessing the reliability of informants’ tips because it had\ndevolved into a “complex superstructure of evidentiary\nand analytical rules,” any one of which, if not complied\nwith, would derail a finding of probable cause. 462 U. S.,\nat 235. We lamented the development of a list of “inflexi-\nble, independent requirements applicable in every case.”\nId., at 230, n. 6. Probable cause, we emphasized, is “a\nfluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities\nin particular factual contexts—not readily, or even use-\nfully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.” Id., at 232.\n   The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established\n6                         FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napproach to determining probable cause. To assess the\nreliability of a drug-detection dog, the court created a\nstrict evidentiary checklist, whose every item the State\nmust tick off.1 Most prominently, an alert cannot estab-\nlish probable cause under the Florida court’s decision\nunless the State introduces comprehensive documentation\nof the dog’s prior “hits” and “misses” in the field. (One\nwonders how the court would apply its test to a rookie\ndog.) No matter how much other proof the State offers of\nthe dog’s reliability, the absent field performance records\nwill preclude a finding of probable cause. That is the\nantithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. It\nis, indeed, the very thing we criticized in Gates when we\noverhauled our method for assessing the trustworthiness\nof an informant’s tip. A gap as to any one matter, we\nexplained, should not sink the State’s case; rather, that\n“deficiency . . . may be compensated for, in determining\nthe overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to . . .\nother indicia of reliability.” Id., at 233. So too here, a\nfinding of a drug-detection dog’s reliability cannot depend\non the State’s satisfaction of multiple, independent eviden-\ntiary requirements. No more for dogs than for human\ninformants is such an inflexible checklist the way to prove\nreliability, and thus establish probable cause.\n   Making matters worse, the decision below treats records\nof a dog’s field performance as the gold standard in evi-\n——————\n    1 Bythe time of oral argument in this case, even Harris declined to\ndefend the idea that the Fourth Amendment compels the State to\nproduce each item of evidence the Florida Supreme Court enumerated.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30 (“I don’t believe the Constitution requires\n[that list]”). Harris instead argued that the court’s decision, although\n“look[ing] rather didactic,” in fact did not impose any such requirement.\nId., at 29; see id., at 31 (“[I]t’s not a specific recipe that can’t be de-\nviated from”). But in reading the decision below as establishing a man-\ndatory checklist, we do no more than take the court at its (oft-repeated)\nword. See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">756</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 758, 759, 771, 775 (Fla. 2011) (holding\nthat the State “must” present the itemized evidence).\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

If a dog\non patrol fails to alert to a car containing drugs, the mis-\ntake usually will go undetected because the officer will not\ninitiate a search. Field data thus may not capture a dog’s\nfalse negatives. Conversely (and more relevant here), if\nthe dog alerts to a car in which the officer finds no narcot-\nics, the dog may not have made a mistake at all. The dog\nmay have detected substances that were too well hidden or\npresent in quantities too small for the officer to locate. Or\nthe dog may have smelled the residual odor of drugs pre-\nviously in the vehicle or on the driver’s person.2 Field data\nthus may markedly overstate a dog’s real false positives.\nBy contrast, those inaccuracies—in either direction—do\nnot taint records of a dog’s performance in standard train-\ning and certification settings. There, the designers of an\nassessment know where drugs are hidden and where they\nare not—and so where a dog should alert and where he\n——————\n  2 See  U. S. Dept. of Army, Military Working Dog Program 30 (Pam-\nphlet 190–12, 1993) (“The odor of a substance may be present in enough\nconcentration to cause the dog to respond even after the substance has\nbeen removed. Therefore, when a detector dog responds and no drug\nor explosive is found, do not assume the dog has made an error”);\nS. Bryson, Police Dog Tactics 257 (2d ed. 2000) (“Four skiers toke up in\nthe parking lot before going up the mountain. Five minutes later a\nnarcotic detector dog alerts to the car. There is no dope inside. How-\never, the dog has performed correctly”). The Florida Supreme Court\ntreated a dog’s response to residual odor as an error, referring to the\n“inability to distinguish between [such] odors and actual drugs” as a\n“facto[r] that call[s] into question Aldo’s reliability.” 71 So. 3d, at 773–\n774; see supra, at 4. But that statement reflects a misunderstanding.\nA detection dog recognizes an odor, not a drug, and should alert when-\never the scent is present, even if the substance is gone (just as a police\nofficer’s much inferior nose detects the odor of marijuana for some time\nafter a joint has been smoked). In the usual case, the mere chance that\nthe substance might no longer be at the location does not matter; a\nwell-trained dog’s alert establishes a fair probability—all that is re-\nquired for probable cause—that either drugs or evidence of a drug\ncrime (like the precursor chemicals in Harris’s truck) will be found.\n8                        FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshould not. The better measure of a dog’s reliability\nthus comes away from the field, in controlled testing\nenvironments.3\n  For that reason, evidence of a dog’s satisfactory perfor-\nmance in a certification or training program can itself\nprovide sufficient reason to trust his alert. If a bona fide\norganization has certified a dog after testing his reliability\nin a controlled setting, a court can presume (subject to any\nconflicting evidence offered) that the dog’s alert provides\nprobable cause to search. The same is true, even in the\nabsence of formal certification, if the dog has recently and\nsuccessfully completed a training program that evaluated\nhis proficiency in locating drugs. After all, law enforce-\nment units have their own strong incentive to use effective\ntraining and certification programs, because only accurate\ndrug-detection dogs enable officers to locate contraband\nwithout incurring unnecessary risks or wasting limited\ntime and resources.\n  A defendant, however, must have an opportunity to\nchallenge such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by\ncross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his\nown fact or expert witnesses. The defendant, for example,\nmay contest the adequacy of a certification or training\nprogram, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax\nor its methods faulty. So too, the defendant may examine\nhow the dog (or handler) performed in the assessments\nmade in those settings. Indeed, evidence of the dog’s (or\nhandler’s) history in the field, although susceptible to the\nkind of misinterpretation we have discussed, may some-\ntimes be relevant, as the Solicitor General acknowledged\n——————\n   3 See K.

And\neven assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances\nsurrounding a particular alert may undermine the case\nfor probable cause—if, say, the officer cued the dog (con-\nsciously or not), or if the team was working under un-\nfamiliar conditions.\n   In short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog’s\nalert should proceed much like any other. The court\nshould allow the parties to make their best case, con-\nsistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure. And\nthe court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to\ndecide what all the circumstances demonstrate. If the\nState has produced proof from controlled settings that a\ndog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defend-\nant has not contested that showing, then the court should\nfind probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has\nchallenged the State’s case (by disputing the reliability of\nthe dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court\nshould weigh the competing evidence. In all events, the\ncourt should not prescribe, as the Florida Supreme Court\ndid, an inflexible set of evidentiary requirements. The\nquestion—similar to every inquiry into probable cause—is\nwhether all the facts surrounding a dog’s alert, viewed\nthrough the lens of common sense, would make a reason-\nably prudent person think that a search would reveal con-\ntraband or evidence of a crime. A sniff is up to snuff when\nit meets that test.\n                             III\n  And here, Aldo’s did. The record in this case amply\nsupported the trial court’s determination that Aldo’s alert\ngave Wheetley probable cause to search Harris’s truck.\n  The State, as earlier described, introduced substantial\n10                  FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence of Aldo’s training and his proficiency in finding\ndrugs. See supra, at 2–3. The State showed that two\nyears before alerting to Harris’s truck, Aldo had success-\nfully completed a 120-hour program in narcotics detection,\nand separately obtained a certification from an independ-\nent company. And although the certification expired after\na year, the Sheriff ’s Office required continuing training\nfor Aldo and Wheetley. The two satisfied the require-\nments of another, 40-hour training program one year prior\nto the search at issue. And Wheetley worked with Aldo\nfor four hours each week on exercises designed to keep\ntheir skills sharp. Wheetley testified, and written records\nconfirmed, that in those settings Aldo always performed at\nthe highest level.\n   Harris, as also noted above, declined to challenge in the\ntrial court any aspect of Aldo’s training. See supra, at 3.\nTo be sure, Harris’s briefs in this Court raise questions\nabout that training’s adequacy—for example, whether the\nprograms simulated sufficiently diverse environments and\nwhether they used enough blind testing (in which the\nhandler does not know the location of drugs and so cannot\ncue the dog). See Brief for Respondent 57–58. Similarly,\nHarris here queries just how well Aldo performed in con-\ntrolled testing. See id., at 58. But Harris never voiced\nthose doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the\nfirst time here. See, e.g., Rugendorf v. United States, 376\nU. S. 528, 534 (1964). As the case came to the trial court,\nAldo had successfully completed two recent drug-detection\ncourses and maintained his proficiency through weekly\ntraining exercises. Viewed alone, that training record—\nwith or without the prior certification—sufficed to estab-\nlish Aldo’s reliability. See supra, at 8–9.\n   And Harris’s cross-examination of Wheetley, which\nfocused on Aldo’s field performance, failed to rebut the\nState’s case. Harris principally contended in the trial\ncourt that because Wheetley did not find any of the sub-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances Aldo was trained to detect, Aldo’s two alerts must\nhave been false. See Brief for Respondent 1; App. 77–80.\nBut we have already described the hazards of inferring too\nmuch from the failure of a dog’s alert to lead to drugs, see\nsupra, at 7; and here we doubt that Harris’s logic does\njustice to Aldo’s skills. Harris cooked and used metham-\nphetamine on a regular basis; so as Wheetley later sur-\nmised, Aldo likely responded to odors that Harris had\ntransferred to the driver’s-side door handle of his truck.\nSee supra, at 3. A well-trained drug-detection dog should\nalert to such odors; his response to them might appear\na mistake, but in fact is not. See n. 2, supra. And still\nmore fundamentally, we do not evaluate probable cause in\nhindsight, based on what a search does or does not turn\nup. See United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948).\nFor the reasons already stated, Wheetley had good cause\nto view Aldo as a reliable detector of drugs. And no special\ncircumstance here gave Wheetley reason to discount Aldo’s\nusual dependability or distrust his response to Harris’s\ntruck.\n   Because training records established Aldo’s reliability in\ndetecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that show-\ning, we agree with the trial court that Wheetley had prob-\nable cause to search Harris’s truck. We accordingly\nreverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 820744, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/02/19/florida_v._harris.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 31, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013\nOfficer Wheetley pulled over respondent Harris for a routine traffic\n  stop. Observing Harris’s nervousness and an open beer can, Wheet-\n  ley sought consent to search Harris’s truck. When Harris refused,\n  Wheetley executed a sniff test with his trained narcotics dog, Aldo.\n  The dog alerted at the driver’s-side door handle, leading Wheetley to\n  conclude that he had probable cause for a search. That search turned\n  up nothing Aldo was trained to detect, but did reveal pseudoephed-\n  rine and other ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine.\n  Harris was arrested and charged with illegal possession of those in-\n  gredients. In a subsequent stop while Harris was out on bail, Aldo\n  again alerted on Harris’s truck but nothing of interest was found. At\n  a suppression hearing, Wheetley testified about his and Aldo’s exten-\n  sive training in drug detection. Harris’s attorney did not contest the\n  quality of that training, focusing instead on Aldo’s certification and\n  performance in the field, particularly in the two stops of Harris’s\n  truck. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, but the Florida\n  Supreme Court reversed. It held that a wide array of evidence was\n  always necessary to establish probable cause, including field-\n  performance records showing how many times the dog has falsely\n  alerted. If an officer like Wheetley failed to keep such records, he\n  could never have probable cause to think the dog a reliable indicator\n  of drugs.\nHeld: Because training and testing records supported Aldo’s reliability\n in detecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that evidence,\n Wheetley had probable cause to search Harris’s truck. Pp. 5–11.\n    (a) In testing whether an officer has probable cause to conduct a\n search, all that is required is the kind of “fair probability” on which\n “reasonable and prudent [people] act.” Illinois v.

HARRIS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    common-sensical standard, this Court has consistently looked to the\n    totality of the circumstances and rejected rigid rules, bright-line\n    tests, and mechanistic inquiries. Ibid.\n       The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established approach by\n    creating a strict evidentiary checklist to assess a drug-detection dog’s\n    reliability. Requiring the State to introduce comprehensive docu-\n    mentation of the dog’s prior hits and misses in the field, and holding\n    that absent field records will preclude a finding of probable cause no\n    matter how much other proof the State offers, is the antithesis of a\n    totality-of-the-circumstances approach. This is made worse by the\n    State Supreme Court’s treatment of field-performance records as the\n    evidentiary gold standard when, in fact, such data may not capture a\n    dog’s false negatives or may markedly overstate a dog’s false posi-\n    tives. Such inaccuracies do not taint records of a dog’s performance\n    in standard training and certification settings, making that perfor-\n    mance a better measure of a dog’s reliability. Field records may\n    sometimes be relevant, but the court should evaluate all the evi-\n    dence, and should not prescribe an inflexible set of requirements.\n       Under the correct approach, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a\n    dog’s alert should proceed much like any other, with the court allow-\n    ing the parties to make their best case and evaluating the totality of\n    the circumstances. If the State has produced proof from controlled\n    settings that a dog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the de-\n    fendant has not contested that showing, the court should find proba-\n    ble cause. But a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge\n    such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by cross-examining the\n    testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses.\n    The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed or\n    too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert. The court\n    should then consider all the evidence and apply the usual test for\n    probable cause—whether all the facts surrounding the alert, viewed\n    through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent\n    person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a\n    crime. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) The record in this case amply supported the trial court’s deter-\n    mination that Aldo’s alert gave Wheetley probable cause to search\n    the truck. The State introduced substantial evidence of Aldo’s train-\n    ing and his proficiency in finding drugs. Harris declined to challenge\n    any aspect of that training or testing in the trial court, and the Court\n    does not consider such arguments when they are presented for this\n    first time in this Court. Harris principally relied below on Wheetley’s\n    failure to find any substance that Aldo was trained to detect.

CLAYTON HARRIS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                       FLORIDA\n\n                              [February 19, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In this case, we consider how a court should determine\nif the “alert” of a drug-detection dog during a traffic stop\nprovides probable cause to search a vehicle. The Florida\nSupreme Court held that the State must in every case\npresent an exhaustive set of records, including a log of the\ndog’s performance in the field, to establish the dog’s relia-\nbility. See 71 So. 3d 756, 775 (2011). We think that de-\nmand inconsistent with the “flexible, common-sense\nstandard” of probable cause. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.\n213, 239 (1983).\n                             I\n   William Wheetley is a K–9 Officer in the Liberty County,\nFlorida Sheriff ’s Office. On June 24, 2006, he was on a\nroutine patrol with Aldo, a German shepherd trained to\ndetect certain narcotics (methamphetamine, marijuana,\ncocaine, heroin, and ecstasy). Wheetley pulled over re-\nspondent Clayton Harris’s truck because it had an expired\nlicense plate. On approaching the driver’s-side door,\nWheetley saw that Harris was “visibly nervous,” unable to\nsit still, shaking, and breathing rapidly. Wheetley also\nnoticed an open can of beer in the truck’s cup holder. App.\n2                    FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n62. Wheetley asked Harris for consent to search the truck,\nbut Harris refused. At that point, Wheetley retrieved Aldo\nfrom the patrol car and walked him around Harris’s truck\nfor a “free air sniff.” Id., at 63. Aldo alerted at the\ndriver’s-side door handle—signaling, through a distinctive\nset of behaviors, that he smelled drugs there.\n  Wheetley concluded, based principally on Aldo’s alert,\nthat he had probable cause to search the truck. His search\ndid not turn up any of the drugs Aldo was trained to de-\ntect. But it did reveal 200 loose pseudoephedrine pills,\n8,000 matches, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, two contain-\ners of antifreeze, and a coffee filter full of iodine crystals—\nall ingredients for making methamphetamine. Wheetley\naccordingly arrested Harris, who admitted after proper\nMiranda warnings that he routinely “cooked” metham-\nphetamine at his house and could not go “more than a few\ndays without using” it. Id., at 68. The State charged\nHarris with possessing pseudoephedrine for use in manu-\nfacturing methamphetamine.\n  While out on bail, Harris had another run-in with\nWheetley and Aldo. This time, Wheetley pulled Harris\nover for a broken brake light. Aldo again sniffed the\ntruck’s exterior, and again alerted at the driver’s-side door\nhandle. Wheetley once more searched the truck, but on\nthis occasion discovered nothing of interest.\n  Harris moved to suppress the evidence found in his\ntruck on the ground that Aldo’s alert had not given Wheet-\nley probable cause for a search. At the hearing on that\nmotion, Wheetley testified about both his and Aldo’s train-\ning in drug detection. See id., at 52–82. In 2004, Wheet-\nley (and a different dog) completed a 160-hour course in\nnarcotics detection offered by the Dothan, Alabama Police\nDepartment, while Aldo (and a different handler) completed\na similar, 120-hour course given by the Apopka, Florida\nPolice Department. That same year, Aldo received a one-\nyear certification from Drug Beat, a private company that\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecializes in testing and certifying K–9 dogs. Wheetley\nand Aldo teamed up in 2005 and went through another,\n40-hour refresher course in Dothan together. They also\ndid four hours of training exercises each week to maintain\ntheir skills. Wheetley would hide drugs in certain ve-\nhicles or buildings while leaving others “blank” to deter-\nmine whether Aldo alerted at the right places. Id., at 57.\nAccording to Wheetley, Aldo’s performance in those exer-\ncises was “really good.” Id., at 60. The State introduced\n“Monthly Canine Detection Training Logs” consistent with\nthat testimony: They showed that Aldo always found\nhidden drugs and that he performed “satisfactorily” (the\nhigher of two possible assessments) on each day of train-\ning. Id., at 109–116.\n   On cross-examination, Harris’s attorney chose not to\ncontest the quality of Aldo’s or Wheetley’s training. She\nfocused instead on Aldo’s certification and his performance\nin the field, particularly the two stops of Harris’s truck.\nWheetley conceded that the certification (which, he noted,\nFlorida law did not require) had expired the year before\nhe pulled Harris over. See id., at 70–71. Wheetley also\nacknowledged that he did not keep complete records of\nAldo’s performance in traffic stops or other field work;\ninstead, he maintained records only of alerts resulting in\narrests. See id., at 71–72, 74. But Wheetley defended\nAldo’s two alerts to Harris’s seemingly narcotics-free\ntruck: According to Wheetley, Harris probably transferred\nthe odor of methamphetamine to the door handle, and\nAldo responded to that “residual odor.” Id., at 80.\n   The trial court concluded that Wheetley had probable\ncause to search Harris’s truck and so denied the motion to\nsuppress. Harris then entered a no-contest plea while\nreserving the right to appeal the trial court’s ruling. An\nintermediate state court summarily affirmed. See 989\nSo. 2d 1214, 1215 (2008) (per curiam).\n   The Florida Supreme Court reversed, holding that\n4                   FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWheetley lacked probable cause to search Harris’s vehicle\nunder the Fourth Amendment. “[W]hen a dog alerts,” the\ncourt wrote, “the fact that the dog has been trained and\ncertified is simply not enough to establish probable cause.”\n71 So. 3d, at 767. To demonstrate a dog’s reliability, the\nState needed to produce a wider array of evidence:\n    “[T]he State must present . . . the dog’s training and\n    certification records, an explanation of the meaning of\n    the particular training and certification, field perfor-\n    mance records (including any unverified alerts), and\n    evidence concerning the experience and training of the\n    officer handling the dog, as well as any other objective\n    evidence known to the officer about the dog’s reliabil-\n    ity.” Id., at 775.\nThe court particularly stressed the need for “evidence of\nthe dog’s performance history,” including records showing\n“how often the dog has alerted in the field without illegal\ncontraband having been found.” Id., at 769. That data,\nthe court stated, could help to expose such problems as a\nhandler’s tendency (conscious or not) to “cue [a] dog to\nalert” and “a dog’s inability to distinguish between resid-\nual odors and actual drugs.” Id., at 769, 774. Accordingly,\nan officer like Wheetley who did not keep full records of\nhis dog’s field performance could never have the requisite\ncause to think “that the dog is a reliable indicator of\ndrugs.” Id., at 773.\n   Judge Canady dissented, maintaining that the major-\nity’s “elaborate and inflexible evidentiary requirements”\nwent beyond the demands of probable cause. Id., at 775.\nHe would have affirmed the trial court’s ruling on the\nstrength of Aldo’s training history and Harris’s “fail[ure]\nto present any evidence challenging” it. Id., at 776.\n   We granted certiorari, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), and now\nreverse.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Texas v. Brown, 460\nU. S. 730, 742 (1983) (plurality opinion) (quoting Carroll v.\nUnited States, 267 U. S. 132, 162 (1925)); see Safford\nUnified School Dist. #1 v. Redding, 557 U. S. 364, 370–\n371 (2009). The test for probable cause is not reducible to\n“precise definition or quantification.” Maryland v. Pringle,\n540 U. S. 366, 371 (2003). “Finely tuned standards such\nas proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance\nof the evidence . . . have no place in the [probable-cause]\ndecision.” Gates, 462 U. S., at 235. All we have required\nis the kind of “fair probability” on which “reasonable and\nprudent [people,] not legal technicians, act.” Id., at 238,\n231 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In evaluating whether the State has met this practical\nand common-sensical standard, we have consistently\nlooked to the totality of the circumstances. See, e.g., Prin-\ngle, 540 U. S., at 371; Gates, 462 U. S., at 232; Brinegar v.\nUnited States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949). We have rejected\nrigid rules, bright-line tests, and mechanistic inquiries in\nfavor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach. In\nGates, for example, we abandoned our old test for as-\nsessing the reliability of informants’ tips because it had\ndevolved into a “complex superstructure of evidentiary\nand analytical rules,” any one of which, if not complied\nwith, would derail a finding of probable cause. 462 U. S.,\nat 235. We lamented the development of a list of “inflexi-\nble, independent requirements applicable in every case.”\nId., at 230, n. 6. Probable cause, we emphasized, is “a\nfluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities\nin particular factual contexts—not readily, or even use-\nfully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.” Id., at 232.\n   The Florida Supreme Court flouted this established\n6                         FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\napproach to determining probable cause. To assess the\nreliability of a drug-detection dog, the court created a\nstrict evidentiary checklist, whose every item the State\nmust tick off.1 Most prominently, an alert cannot estab-\nlish probable cause under the Florida court’s decision\nunless the State introduces comprehensive documentation\nof the dog’s prior “hits” and “misses” in the field. (One\nwonders how the court would apply its test to a rookie\ndog.) No matter how much other proof the State offers of\nthe dog’s reliability, the absent field performance records\nwill preclude a finding of probable cause. That is the\nantithesis of a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. It\nis, indeed, the very thing we criticized in Gates when we\noverhauled our method for assessing the trustworthiness\nof an informant’s tip. A gap as to any one matter, we\nexplained, should not sink the State’s case; rather, that\n“deficiency . . . may be compensated for, in determining\nthe overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to . . .\nother indicia of reliability.” Id., at 233. So too here, a\nfinding of a drug-detection dog’s reliability cannot depend\non the State’s satisfaction of multiple, independent eviden-\ntiary requirements. No more for dogs than for human\ninformants is such an inflexible checklist the way to prove\nreliability, and thus establish probable cause.\n   Making matters worse, the decision below treats records\nof a dog’s field performance as the gold standard in evi-\n——————\n    1 Bythe time of oral argument in this case, even Harris declined to\ndefend the idea that the Fourth Amendment compels the State to\nproduce each item of evidence the Florida Supreme Court enumerated.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 29–30 (“I don’t believe the Constitution requires\n[that list]”). Harris instead argued that the court’s decision, although\n“look[ing] rather didactic,” in fact did not impose any such requirement.\nId., at 29; see id., at 31 (“[I]t’s not a specific recipe that can’t be de-\nviated from”). But in reading the decision below as establishing a man-\ndatory checklist, we do no more than take the court at its (oft-repeated)\nword. See, e.g., 71 So. 3d 756, 758, 759, 771, 775 (Fla. 2011) (holding\nthat the State “must” present the itemized evidence).\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

If a dog\non patrol fails to alert to a car containing drugs, the mis-\ntake usually will go undetected because the officer will not\ninitiate a search. Field data thus may not capture a dog’s\nfalse negatives. Conversely (and more relevant here), if\nthe dog alerts to a car in which the officer finds no narcot-\nics, the dog may not have made a mistake at all. The dog\nmay have detected substances that were too well hidden or\npresent in quantities too small for the officer to locate. Or\nthe dog may have smelled the residual odor of drugs pre-\nviously in the vehicle or on the driver’s person.2 Field data\nthus may markedly overstate a dog’s real false positives.\nBy contrast, those inaccuracies—in either direction—do\nnot taint records of a dog’s performance in standard train-\ning and certification settings. There, the designers of an\nassessment know where drugs are hidden and where they\nare not—and so where a dog should alert and where he\n——————\n  2 See  U. S. Dept. of Army, Military Working Dog Program 30 (Pam-\nphlet 190–12, 1993) (“The odor of a substance may be present in enough\nconcentration to cause the dog to respond even after the substance has\nbeen removed. Therefore, when a detector dog responds and no drug\nor explosive is found, do not assume the dog has made an error”);\nS. Bryson, Police Dog Tactics 257 (2d ed. 2000) (“Four skiers toke up in\nthe parking lot before going up the mountain. Five minutes later a\nnarcotic detector dog alerts to the car. There is no dope inside. How-\never, the dog has performed correctly”). The Florida Supreme Court\ntreated a dog’s response to residual odor as an error, referring to the\n“inability to distinguish between [such] odors and actual drugs” as a\n“facto[r] that call[s] into question Aldo’s reliability.” 71 So. 3d, at 773–\n774; see supra, at 4. But that statement reflects a misunderstanding.\nA detection dog recognizes an odor, not a drug, and should alert when-\never the scent is present, even if the substance is gone (just as a police\nofficer’s much inferior nose detects the odor of marijuana for some time\nafter a joint has been smoked). In the usual case, the mere chance that\nthe substance might no longer be at the location does not matter; a\nwell-trained dog’s alert establishes a fair probability—all that is re-\nquired for probable cause—that either drugs or evidence of a drug\ncrime (like the precursor chemicals in Harris’s truck) will be found.\n8                        FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nshould not. The better measure of a dog’s reliability\nthus comes away from the field, in controlled testing\nenvironments.3\n  For that reason, evidence of a dog’s satisfactory perfor-\nmance in a certification or training program can itself\nprovide sufficient reason to trust his alert. If a bona fide\norganization has certified a dog after testing his reliability\nin a controlled setting, a court can presume (subject to any\nconflicting evidence offered) that the dog’s alert provides\nprobable cause to search. The same is true, even in the\nabsence of formal certification, if the dog has recently and\nsuccessfully completed a training program that evaluated\nhis proficiency in locating drugs. After all, law enforce-\nment units have their own strong incentive to use effective\ntraining and certification programs, because only accurate\ndrug-detection dogs enable officers to locate contraband\nwithout incurring unnecessary risks or wasting limited\ntime and resources.\n  A defendant, however, must have an opportunity to\nchallenge such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by\ncross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his\nown fact or expert witnesses. The defendant, for example,\nmay contest the adequacy of a certification or training\nprogram, perhaps asserting that its standards are too lax\nor its methods faulty. So too, the defendant may examine\nhow the dog (or handler) performed in the assessments\nmade in those settings. Indeed, evidence of the dog’s (or\nhandler’s) history in the field, although susceptible to the\nkind of misinterpretation we have discussed, may some-\ntimes be relevant, as the Solicitor General acknowledged\n——————\n   3 See K. Furton, J. Greb, & H. Holness, Florida Int’l Univ., The Scien-\n\ntific Working Group on Dog and Orthogonal Detector Guidelines 1, 61–\n62, 66 (2010) (recommending as a “best practice” that a dog’s reliability\nshould be assessed based on “the results of certification and proficiency\nassessments,” because in those “procedure[s] you should know whether\nyou have a false positive,” unlike in “most operational situations”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–24 (“[T]he\ndefendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the\nstand, about field performance, and then the court can\ngive that answer whatever weight is appropriate”). And\neven assuming a dog is generally reliable, circumstances\nsurrounding a particular alert may undermine the case\nfor probable cause—if, say, the officer cued the dog (con-\nsciously or not), or if the team was working under un-\nfamiliar conditions.\n   In short, a probable-cause hearing focusing on a dog’s\nalert should proceed much like any other. The court\nshould allow the parties to make their best case, con-\nsistent with the usual rules of criminal procedure. And\nthe court should then evaluate the proffered evidence to\ndecide what all the circumstances demonstrate. If the\nState has produced proof from controlled settings that a\ndog performs reliably in detecting drugs, and the defend-\nant has not contested that showing, then the court should\nfind probable cause. If, in contrast, the defendant has\nchallenged the State’s case (by disputing the reliability of\nthe dog overall or of a particular alert), then the court\nshould weigh the competing evidence. In all events, the\ncourt should not prescribe, as the Florida Supreme Court\ndid, an inflexible set of evidentiary requirements. The\nquestion—similar to every inquiry into probable cause—is\nwhether all the facts surrounding a dog’s alert, viewed\nthrough the lens of common sense, would make a reason-\nably prudent person think that a search would reveal con-\ntraband or evidence of a crime. A sniff is up to snuff when\nit meets that test.\n                             III\n  And here, Aldo’s did. The record in this case amply\nsupported the trial court’s determination that Aldo’s alert\ngave Wheetley probable cause to search Harris’s truck.\n  The State, as earlier described, introduced substantial\n10                  FLORIDA v. HARRIS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence of Aldo’s training and his proficiency in finding\ndrugs. See supra, at 2–3. The State showed that two\nyears before alerting to Harris’s truck, Aldo had success-\nfully completed a 120-hour program in narcotics detection,\nand separately obtained a certification from an independ-\nent company. And although the certification expired after\na year, the Sheriff ’s Office required continuing training\nfor Aldo and Wheetley. The two satisfied the require-\nments of another, 40-hour training program one year prior\nto the search at issue. And Wheetley worked with Aldo\nfor four hours each week on exercises designed to keep\ntheir skills sharp. Wheetley testified, and written records\nconfirmed, that in those settings Aldo always performed at\nthe highest level.\n   Harris, as also noted above, declined to challenge in the\ntrial court any aspect of Aldo’s training. See supra, at 3.\nTo be sure, Harris’s briefs in this Court raise questions\nabout that training’s adequacy—for example, whether the\nprograms simulated sufficiently diverse environments and\nwhether they used enough blind testing (in which the\nhandler does not know the location of drugs and so cannot\ncue the dog). See Brief for Respondent 57–58. Similarly,\nHarris here queries just how well Aldo performed in con-\ntrolled testing. See id., at 58. But Harris never voiced\nthose doubts in the trial court, and cannot do so for the\nfirst time here. See, e.g., Rugendorf v. United States, 376\nU. S. 528, 534 (1964). As the case came to the trial court,\nAldo had successfully completed two recent drug-detection\ncourses and maintained his proficiency through weekly\ntraining exercises. Viewed alone, that training record—\nwith or without the prior certification—sufficed to estab-\nlish Aldo’s reliability. See supra, at 8–9.\n   And Harris’s cross-examination of Wheetley, which\nfocused on Aldo’s field performance, failed to rebut the\nState’s case. Harris principally contended in the trial\ncourt that because Wheetley did not find any of the sub-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances Aldo was trained to detect, Aldo’s two alerts must\nhave been false. See Brief for Respondent 1; App. 77–80.\nBut we have already described the hazards of inferring too\nmuch from the failure of a dog’s alert to lead to drugs, see\nsupra, at 7; and here we doubt that Harris’s logic does\njustice to Aldo’s skills. Harris cooked and used metham-\nphetamine on a regular basis; so as Wheetley later sur-\nmised, Aldo likely responded to odors that Harris had\ntransferred to the driver’s-side door handle of his truck.\nSee supra, at 3. A well-trained drug-detection dog should\nalert to such odors; his response to them might appear\na mistake, but in fact is not. See n. 2, supra. And still\nmore fundamentally, we do not evaluate probable cause in\nhindsight, based on what a search does or does not turn\nup. See United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948).\nFor the reasons already stated, Wheetley had good cause\nto view Aldo as a reliable detector of drugs. And no special\ncircumstance here gave Wheetley reason to discount Aldo’s\nusual dependability or distrust his response to Harris’s\ntruck.\n   Because training records established Aldo’s reliability in\ndetecting drugs and Harris failed to undermine that show-\ning, we agree with the trial court that Wheetley had prob-\nable cause to search Harris’s truck. We accordingly\nreverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/820744/", "sha1": "b26111ef83add1a046100518711cfd7859942361", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2013-02-19T07:12:41.093659"}
