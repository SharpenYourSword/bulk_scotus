PHOEBE PUTNEY\n         HEALTH SYSTEM, INC., ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 11\u20131160. Argued November 26, 2012\u2014Decided February 19, 2013\nUnder Georgia\u2019s Hospital Authorities Law (Law), political subdivisions\n may create special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities\n to provide \u201cfor the operation and maintenance of needed health care\n facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th[e] state.\u201d\n The Law permits authorities to \u201cexercise public and essential gov-\n ernmental functions\u201d and delegates to them numerous general pow-\n ers, including the ability to acquire and lease hospitals and other\n public health facilities. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375.\n    The Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County (Authority)\n owns Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (Memorial), one of two hos-\n pitals in the county. The Authority formed two private nonprofit cor-\n porations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.\n (PPHS) and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc. (PPMH). After\n the Authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county\n and lease it to a subsidiary of PPHS, the Federal Trade Commission\n (FTC) issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transac-\n tion would substantially reduce competition in the market for acute-\n care hospital services, in violation of \u00a75 of the Federal Trade Com-\n mission Act and \u00a77 of the Clayton Act. The FTC and Georgia subse-\n quently sued the Authority, PPHS, PPMH, and others (collectively\n respondents), seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administra-\n tive proceedings. The District Court denied the request for a prelim-\n inary injunction and granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss, holding\n that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the state-\n action doctrine. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It concluded that the\n Authority, as a local governmental entity, was entitled to state-action\n immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a fore-\n2          FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    seeable result of the Law. The court reasoned that the state legisla-\n    ture could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect, given\n    the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities, particu-\n    larly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation\n    of hospital ownership.\nHeld: Because Georgia has not clearly articulated and affirmatively\n expressed a policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions\n that substantially lessen competition, state-action immunity does not\n apply. Pp. 6\u201319.\n    (a) This Court recognized in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, 350\u2013\n 352, that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent States from impos-\n ing market restraints \u201cas an act of government . . . .\u201d Under the\n state-action doctrine, immunity from federal antitrust law may ex-\n tend to nonstate actors carrying out the State\u2019s regulatory program.\n See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 99\u2013100. But given the anti-\n trust laws\u2019 values of free enterprise and economic competition, \u201cstate-\n action immunity is disfavored,\u201d FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S.\n 621, 636, and is recognized only when it is clear that the challenged\n anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to the \u201cState\u2019s own\u201d\n regulatory scheme, id., at 635. Immunity will attach only to activi-\n ties of substate governmental entities that are undertaken pursuant\n to a \u201cclearly articulated and affirmatively expressed\u201d state policy to\n displace competition. Community Communications Co. v. Boulder,\n 455 U. S. 40, 52. A state legislature need not \u201cexpressly state\u201d that\n intent, Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 43, but the anticompetitive\n effect must have been the \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of what the State au-\n thorized, id., at 42. Pp. 6\u20139.\n    (b) Respondents\u2019 state-action immunity defense fails under the\n clear-articulation test because there is no evidence the State affirma-\n tively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competi-\n tion by consolidating hospital ownership. The Authority\u2019s powers, in-\n cluding its acquisition and leasing powers, mirror general powers\n routinely conferred by state law on private corporations. More is re-\n quired to establish state-action immunity; the Authority must show\n that it has been delegated authority not just to act, but to act or regu-\n late anticompetitively. Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,\n 499 U. S. 365, 372. In Boulder, this Court concluded that a Colorado\n law granting municipalities the power to enact ordinances governing\n local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test, 455 U. S., at\n 55\u201356, because, when a State\u2019s position \u201cis one of mere neutrality re-\n specting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive,\u201d the\n State cannot be said to have \u201c \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d those anticompetitive\n actions, id., at 55.\n    That principle controls here. Grants of general corporate power al-\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nlowing substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive\nmarketplace are typically used without raising federal antitrust con-\ncerns, so a State cannot be said to have contemplated that such pow-\ners will be used anticompetitively. Here, though the Law allows the\nAuthority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and af-\nfirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to make\nacquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen com-\npetition. Pp. 9\u201310.\n   (c) In concluding otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit applied the con-\ncept of \u201cforeseeability\u201d too loosely. This Court, recognizing that no\nlegislature \u201ccan be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects\u201d of\na statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity,\nHallie, 471 U. S., at 43, has approached the clear-articulation inquiry\npractically, but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the\nState must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of\ncompetition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be\nattributed to the \u201cstate itself,\u201d Parker, 317 U. S., at 352. Thus, the\nCourt has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was\nsufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the\ninherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority dele-\ngated by the state legislature. In that scenario, the State must have\nforeseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as con-\nsistent with its policy goals. See Hallie, 471 U. S., at 41; Omni, 499\nU. S., at 373. By contrast, when a State grants an entity a general\npower to act, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.\nEntities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their\npowers anticompetitively, but a reasonable legislature\u2019s ability to an-\nticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an af-\nfirmative state policy to displace competition. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\nargument, echoed by respondents, that the case falls within the fore-\nseeability standard used in Hallie and Omni is rejected. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   (d) Respondents\u2019 additional arguments are also unpersuasive.\nThey contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique\npowers and responsibilities to fulfill Georgia\u2019s objective of providing\naccess to adequate and affordable health care, it was foreseeable that\nthey would decide that the best way to serve their communities was\nto acquire an existing local hospital, instead of incurring the addi-\ntional expense and regulatory burden of expanding, or constructing, a\nfacility. But even though the authorities may differ from private cor-\nporations offering hospital services, neither the Law nor any other\nstate-law provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authori-\nties to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anti-\ncompetitive effects. Respondents also contend that when there is\ndoubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied, federal\n4          FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid im-\n    proper interference with state policy choices. But the Law here is not\n    ambiguous, and respondents\u2019 suggestion is inconsistent with the\n    principle that \u201cstate-action immunity is disfavored,\u201d Ticor Title, 504\n    U. S., at 636. Pp. 14\u201319.\n663 F. 3d 1369, reversed and remanded.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 568 U.

In this case, we must decide\nwhether a Georgia law that creates special-purpose public\nentities called hospital authorities and gives those entities\ngeneral corporate powers, including the power to acquire\nhospitals, clearly articulates and affirmatively expresses a\nstate policy to permit acquisitions that substantially lessen\ncompetition. Because Georgia\u2019s grant of general cor-\nporate powers to hospital authorities does not include\npermission to use those powers anticompetitively, we hold\nthat the clear-articulation test is not satisfied and state\u00ad\naction immunity does not apply.\n                              I\n                             A\n  In 1941, the State of Georgia amended its Constitution\nto allow political subdivisions to provide health care ser\u00ad\n2       FTC v.

Hospital Auth. of Albany,\n195 Ga. 189, 200, 23 S. E. 2d 716, 723 (1942) (citations\nomitted). As amended, the Law authorizes each county\nand municipality, and certain combinations of counties\nor municipalities, to create \u201ca public body corporate and\npolitic\u201d called a \u201chospital authority.\u201d \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201372(a), (d).\nHospital authorities are governed by 5- to 9-member\nboards that are appointed by the governing body of the\ncounty or municipality in their area of operation. \u00a731\u20137\u2013\n72(a).\n   Under the Law, a hospital authority \u201cexercise[s] public\nand essential governmental functions\u201d and is delegated\n\u201call the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and\neffectuate\u201d the Law\u2019s purposes. \u00a731\u20137\u201375. Giving more\ncontent to that general delegation, the Law enumerates 27\npowers conferred upon hospital authorities, including the\npower \u201c[t]o acquire by purchase, lease, or otherwise and to\noperate projects,\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4), which are defined to in\u00ad\nclude hospitals and other public health facilities, \u00a731\u20137\u2013\n71(5); \u201c[t]o construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, and\nrepair projects,\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201375(5); \u201c[t]o lease . . . for operation\nby others any project\u201d provided certain conditions are\nsatisfied, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7); and \u201c[t]o establish rates and charges\nfor the services and use of the facilities of the authority,\u201d\n\u00a731\u20137\u201375(10).

In 1990, the Authority restructured its\noperations by forming two private nonprofit corporations\nto manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.\n(PPHS), and its subsidiary, Phoebe Putney Memorial\nHospital, Inc. (PPMH). The Authority leased Memorial\nto PPMH for $1 per year for 40 years. Under the lease,\nPPMH has exclusive authority over the operation of Me\u00ad\nmorial, including the ability to set rates for services.\nConsistent with \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7), PPMH is subject to lease\nconditions that require provision of care to the indigent\nsick and limit its rate of return.\n   Memorial is one of two hospitals in Dougherty County.\nThe second, Palmyra Medical Center (Palmyra), was estab\u00ad\nlished in Albany in 1971 and is located just two miles\nfrom Memorial. At the time suit was brought in this case,\nPalmyra was operated by a national for-profit hospital\nnetwork, HCA, Inc. (HCA). Together, Memorial and Pal\u00ad\nmyra account for 86 percent of the market for acute-care\nhospital services provided to commercial health care plans\nand their customers in the six counties surrounding Al-\nbany. Memorial accounts for 75 percent of that market on\nits own.\n   In 2010, PPHS began discussions with HCA about\nacquiring Palmyra. Following negotiations, PPHS pre\u00ad\nsented the Authority with a plan under which the Author\u00ad\nity would purchase Palmyra with PPHS controlled funds\nand then lease Palmyra to a PPHS subsidiary for $1 per\nyear under the Memorial lease agreement. The Authority\n4        FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nunanimously approved the transaction.\n   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shortly there\u00ad\nafter issued an administrative complaint alleging that the\nproposed purchase-and-lease transaction would create a\nvirtual monopoly and would substantially reduce competi\u00ad\ntion in the market for acute-care hospital services, in\nviolation of \u00a75 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38\nStat. 719, 15 U. S. C. \u00a745, and \u00a77 of the Clayton Act, 38\nStat. 731, 15 U. S. C. \u00a718. The FTC, along with the State\nof Georgia,1 subsequently filed suit against the Authority,\nHCA, Palmyra, PPHS, PPMH, and the new PPHS subsid\u00ad\niary created to manage Palmyra (collectively respondents),\nseeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative\nproceedings. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a726, 53(b).\n   The United States District Court for the Middle District\nof Georgia denied the request for a preliminary injunction\nand granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss. 793 F. Supp.\n2d 1356 (2011). The District Court held that respondents\nare immune from antitrust liability under the state-action\ndoctrine. See id., at 1366\u20131381.\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit affirmed. 663 F. 3d 1369 (2011). As an initial\nmatter, the court \u201cagree[d] with the [FTC] that, on the\nfacts alleged, the joint operation of Memorial and Palmyra\nwould substantially lessen competition or tend to create,\nif not create, a monopoly.\u201d Id., at 1375. But the court con\u00ad\ncluded that the transaction was immune from antitrust\nliability. See id., at 1375\u20131378. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that as a local governmental entity, the Author\u00ad\nity was entitled to state-action immunity if the challenged\nanticompetitive conduct was a \u201c \u2018foreseeable result\u2019 \u201d of\nGeorgia\u2019s legislation. Id., at 1375. According to the court,\nanticompetitive conduct is foreseeable if it could have been\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Georgia did not join the notice of appeal filed by the FTC and is no\n\nlonger a party in the case.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Hospital\nBd. of Directors of Lee Cty., 38 F. 3d 1184, 1188, 1190\u2013\n1191 (CA11 1994)). Applying that standard, the Court of\nAppeals concluded that the Law contemplated the anti\u00ad\ncompetitive conduct challenged by the FTC. The court\nnoted the \u201cimpressive breadth\u201d of the powers given to\nhospital authorities, which include traditional powers of\nprivate corporations and a few additional capabilities,\nsuch as the power to exercise eminent domain. See 663\nF. 3d, at 1376. More specifically, the court reasoned that\nthe Georgia Legislature must have anticipated that the\ngrant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease\nprojects would produce anticompetitive effects because\n\u201c[f]oreseeably, acquisitions could consolidate ownership\nof competing hospitals, eliminating competition between\nthem.\u201d Id., at 1377.2\n    The Court of Appeals also rejected the FTC\u2019s alternative\nargument that state-action immunity did not apply be\u00ad\ncause the transaction in substance involved a transfer of\ncontrol over Palmyra from one private entity to another,\nwith the Authority acting as a mere conduit for the sale to\nevade antitrust liability. See id., at 1376, n. 12.\n    We granted certiorari on two questions: whether the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In tension with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, other Circuits have\n\nheld in analogous circumstances that substate governmental entities\nexercising general corporate powers were not entitled to state-action\nimmunity.

PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nGeorgia Legislature, through the powers it vested in hos\u00ad\npital authorities, clearly articulated and affirmatively\nexpressed a state policy to displace competition in the\nmarket for hospital services; and if so, whether state\u00ad\naction immunity is nonetheless inapplicable as a result of\nthe Authority\u2019s minimal participation in negotiating the\nterms of the sale of Palymra and the Authority\u2019s limited\nsupervision of the two hospitals\u2019 operations. See 567\nU. S. ___ (2012). Concluding that the answer to the first\nquestion is \u201cno,\u201d we reverse without reaching the second\nquestion.3\n                             II\n  In Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), this Court\nheld that because \u201cnothing in the language of the Sher\u00ad\nman Act [15 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.] or in its history\u201d suggested\nthat Congress intended to restrict the sovereign capacity\nof the States to regulate their economies, the Act should\nnot be read to bar States from imposing market restraints\n\u201cas an act of government.\u201d Id., at 350, 352.

PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstate governmental entity must also show that it has\nbeen delegated authority to act or regulate anticompeti\u00ad\ntively. See Omni, 499 U. S., at 372. In Boulder, we held\nthat Colorado\u2019s Home Rule Amendment allowing munici\u00ad\npalities to govern local affairs did not satisfy the clear\u00ad\narticulation test. 455 U. S., at 55\u201356. There was no doubt\nin that case that the city had authority as a matter of\nstate law to pass an ordinance imposing a moratorium on\na cable provider\u2019s expansion of service. Id., at 45\u201346. But\nwe rejected the proposition that \u201cthe general grant of\npower to enact ordinances necessarily implies state au\u00ad\nthorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances\u201d\nbecause such an approach \u201cwould wholly eviscerate the\nconcepts of \u2018clear articulation and affirmative expression\u2019\nthat our precedents require.\u201d Id., at 56. We explained\nthat when a State\u2019s position \u201cis one of mere neutrality\nrespecting the municipal actions challenged as anticom\u00ad\npetitive,\u201d the State cannot be said to have \u201c \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d\nthose anticompetitive actions. Id., at 55.\n   The principle articulated in Boulder controls this case.\nGrants of general corporate power that allow substate\ngovernmental entities to participate in a competitive\nmarketplace should be, can be, and typically are used in\nways that raise no federal antitrust concerns. As a result,\na State that has delegated such general powers \u201ccan\nhardly be said to have \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d that they will be\nused anticompetitively. Ibid. See also 1A P.

Thus, while the Law does allow the Authority\nto acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and\naffirmatively express a state policy empowering the Au\u00ad\nthority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will\nsubstantially lessen competition.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Ibid. Instead, we have\napproached the clear-articulation inquiry more practically,\nbut without diluting the ultimate requirement that the\nState must have affirmatively contemplated the displace\u00ad\nment of competition such that the challenged anticompeti\u00ad\ntive effects can be attributed to the \u201cstate itself.\u201d Parker,\n317 U. S., at 352. Thus, we have concluded that a state\npolicy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently\nexpressed where the displacement of competition was the\ninherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of\nauthority delegated by the state legislature. In that sce\u00ad\nnario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly en\u00ad\ndorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its\npolicy goals.\n   For example, in Hallie, Wisconsin statutory law regulat\u00ad\ning the municipal provision of sewage services expressly\npermitted cities to limit their service to surrounding unin\u00ad\ncorporated areas. See 471 U. S., at 41. While unincorpo\u00ad\nrated towns alleged that the city\u2019s exercise of that power\nconstituted an unlawful tying arrangement, an unlawful\nrefusal to deal, and an abuse of monopoly power, we had\nno trouble concluding that these alleged anticompetitive\n12       FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\neffects were affirmatively contemplated by the State be\u00ad\ncause it was \u201cclear\u201d that they \u201clogically would result\u201d from\nthe grant of authority. Id., at 42. As described by the\nWisconsin Supreme Court, the state legislature \u201c \u2018viewed\nannexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated\narea as a reasonable quid pro quo that a city could require\nbefore extending sewer services to the area.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 44\u2013\n45, n. 8 (quoting Hallie v. Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d\n533, 540\u2013541, 314 N. W. 2d 321, 325 (1982)). Without\nimmunity, federal antitrust law could have undermined\nthat arrangement and taken completely off the table the\npolicy option that the State clearly intended for cities to\nhave.\n  Similarly, in Omni, where the respondents alleged that\nthe city had used its zoning power to protect an incumbent\nbillboard provider against competition, we found that the\nclear-articulation test was easily satisfied even though the\nstate statutes delegating zoning authority to the city did\nnot explicitly permit the suppression of competition. We\nexplained that \u201c[t]he very purpose of zoning regulation is\nto displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that\nregularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of com\u00ad\npetition\u201d and that a zoning ordinance regulating the size,\nlocation, and spacing of billboards \u201cnecessarily protects\nexisting billboards against some competition from new\u00ad\ncomers.\u201d 499 U. S., at 373. Other cases in which we have\nfound a \u201cclear articulation\u201d of the State\u2019s intent to displace\ncompetition without an explicit statement have also in\u00ad\nvolved authorizations to act or regulate in ways that were\ninherently anticompetitive.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.

When a State\ngrants some entity general power to act, whether it is a\nprivate corporation or a public entity like the Authority, it\ndoes so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law. See\nTicor Title, 504 U. S., at 632. Of course, both private\nparties and local governmental entities conceivably may\ntransgress antitrust requirements by exercising their\ngeneral powers in anticompetitive ways. But a reasonable\nlegislature\u2019s ability to anticipate that (potentially undesir\u00ad\nable) possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an\naffirmative state policy to displace competition with a\nregulatory alternative.\n  Believing that this case falls within the scope of the\nforeseeability standard applied in Hallie and Omni, the\nCourt of Appeals stated that \u201c[i]t defies imagination to\nsuppose the [state] legislature could have believed that\nevery geographic market in Georgia was so replete with\nhospitals that authorizing acquisitions by the authorities\ncould have no serious anticompetitive consequences.\u201d 663\nF. 3d, at 1377. Respondents echo this argument, noting\nthat each of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties covers a small geo\u00ad\ngraphical area and that most of them are sparsely popu\u00ad\nlated, with nearly three-quarters having fewer than\n50,000 residents as of the 2010 Census.

Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4) has the potential\nto negatively affect competition. Contrary to the Court of\nAppeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 characterization, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(4) is\nnot principally concerned with hospital authorities\u2019 ability\nto acquire multiple hospitals and consolidate their opera\u00ad\ntions. Section 31\u20137\u201375(4) allows authorities to acquire\n\u201cprojects,\u201d which includes not only \u201chospitals,\u201d but also\n\u201chealth care facilities, dormitories, office buildings, clinics,\nhousing accommodations, nursing homes, rehabilitation\ncenters, extended care facilities, and other public health\nfacilities.\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201371(5). Narrowing our focus to the mar\u00ad\nket for hospital services, the power to acquire hospitals\nstill does not ordinarily produce anticompetitive effects.\nSection 31\u20137\u201375(4) was, after all, the source of power for\nnewly formed hospital authorities to acquire a hospital in\nthe first instance\u2014a transaction that was unlikely to raise\nany antitrust concerns even in small markets because the\ntransfer of ownership from private to public hands does\nnot increase market concentration. See 1A Areeda &\nHovenkamp \u00b6224e(c), at 126 (\u201c[S]ubstitution of one mo\u00ad\nnopolist for another is not an antitrust violation\u201d). While\nsubsequent acquisitions by authorities have the potential\nto reduce competition, they will raise federal antitrust\nconcerns only in markets that are large enough to support\nmore than one hospital but sufficiently small that the\nmerger of competitors would lead to a significant increase\nin market concentration. This is too slender a reed to\nsupport the Court of Appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 inference.\n                           IV\n                            A\n Taking a somewhat different approach than the Court of\nAppeals, respondents insist that the Law should not be\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Rather, they contend that hos\u00ad\npital authorities are granted unique powers and respon-\nsibilities to fulfill the State\u2019s objective of providing all\nresidents with access to adequate and affordable health\nand hospital care. See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375(22).\nRespondents argue that in view of hospital authorities\u2019\nstatutory objective, their specific attributes, and the regu\u00ad\nlatory context in which they operate, it was foreseeable\nthat authorities facing capacity constraints would decide\nthey could best serve their communities\u2019 needs by acquir\u00ad\ning an existing local hospital rather than incur the addi\u00ad\ntional expense and regulatory burden of expanding a\nfacility or constructing a new one. See Brief for Respond\u00ad\nents 33\u201339.\n   In support of this argument, respondents observe that\nhospital authorities are simultaneously empowered to act\nin ways private entities cannot while also being subject to\nsignificant regulatory constraints. On the power side, as\nthe Court of Appeals noted, 663 F. 3d, at 1376\u20131377,\nhospital authorities may acquire through eminent domain\nproperty that is \u201cessential to the [authority\u2019s] purposes.\u201d\n\u00a731\u20137\u201375(12).8 On the restraint side, hospital authorities\nare managed by a publicly accountable board, \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u2013\n74.1, 31\u20137\u201376, they must operate on a nonprofit basis,\n\u00a731\u20137\u201377, and they may only lease a project for others to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Court of Appeals also invoked Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201384, which\n\nprovides that hospital authorities do not have the power to assess\ntaxes, but allows the applicable governing body in the authority\u2019s area\nof operation to impose taxes to cover the authority\u2019s expenses. See 663\nF. 3d, at 1377. This provision applies in cases in which the county or\nmunicipality has entered into a contract with a hospital authority for\nthe use of its facilities. See \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201384(a), 31\u20137\u201385. No such contract\nexists in this case, and respondents have not relied on this provision in\nbriefing or argument before us.\n16        FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\noperate after determining that doing so will promote the\ncommunity\u2019s public health needs and that the lessee will\nnot receive more than a reasonable rate of return on its\ninvestment, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7). Moreover, hospital authorities\noperate within a broader regulatory context in which\nGeorgia requires any party seeking to establish or signifi\u00ad\ncantly expand certain medical facilities, including hospi\u00ad\ntals, to obtain a certificate of need from state regulators.\nSee \u00a731\u20136\u201340 et seq.9\n   We have no doubt that Georgia\u2019s hospital authorities\ndiffer materially from private corporations that offer\nhospital services. But nothing in the Law or any other\nprovision of Georgia law clearly articulates a state policy\nto allow authorities to exercise their general corporate\npowers, including their acquisition power, without regard\nto negative effects on competition. The state legislature\u2019s\nobjective of improving access to affordable health care does\nnot logically suggest that the State intended that hospital\nauthorities pursue that end through mergers that create\nmonopolies. Nor do the restrictions imposed on hospital\nauthorities, including the requirement that they operate\non a nonprofit basis, reveal such a policy. Particularly in\nlight of our national policy favoring competition, these\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Georgia  first adopted certificate of need legislation in 1978 in part to\ncomply with a since-repealed federal law conditioning federal funding\nfor a number of health care programs on a State\u2019s enactment of certifi\u00ad\ncate of need laws. See 1978 Ga. Laws p. 941, as amended, Ga. Code\nAnn. \u00a731\u20136\u201340 et seq. (2012); see also National Health Planning and\nResources Development Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2246, repealed by \u00a7701(a),\n100 Stat. 3799. Many other States also have certificate of need laws.\nSee National Conference of State Legislatures, Certificate of Need:\nState Health Laws and Programs, online at http://www.ncsl.org/issues\u00ad\nresearch/health/con-certificate-of-need-state-laws.aspx (as visited Feb.\n15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (indicating in\n\u201cStates with CON Programs\u201d table that 35 States retained some type of\ncertificate of need program as of December 2011 while 15 other States\nhad such programs but have repealed them).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrestrictions should be read to reflect more modest aims.\nThe legislature may have viewed profit generation as\nincompatible with its goal of providing care for the indi\u00ad\ngent sick. In addition, the legislature may have believed\nthat some hospital authorities would operate in markets\nwith characteristics of natural monopolies, in which case\nthe legislature could not rely on competition to control\nprices. See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579,\n595\u2013596 (1976).\n  We recognize that Georgia, particularly through its\ncertificate of need requirement, does limit competition in\nthe market for hospital services in some respects. But\nregulation of an industry, and even the authorization of\ndiscrete forms of anticompetitive conduct pursuant to a\nregulatory structure, does not establish that the State has\naffirmatively contemplated other forms of anticompetitive\nconduct that are only tangentially related. Thus, in Gold-\nfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773 (1975), we re-\njected a state-action defense to price-fixing claims where a\nstate bar adopted a compulsory minimum fee schedule.\nAlthough the State heavily regulated the practice of law,\nwe found no evidence that it had adopted a policy to dis\u00ad\nplace price competition among lawyers. Id., at 788\u2013792.\nAnd in Cantor, we concluded that a state commission\u2019s\nregulation of rates for electricity charged by a public utili\u00ad\nty did not confer state-action immunity for a claim that\nthe utility\u2019s free distribution of light bulbs restrained\ntrade in the light-bulb market. 428 U. S., at 596.\n  In this case, the fact that Georgia imposes limits on\nentry into the market for medical services, which apply to\nboth hospital authorities and private corporations, does\nnot clearly articulate a policy favoring the consolidation of\nexisting hospitals that are engaged in active competition.\nAccord, FTC v. University Health, Inc., 938 F. 2d 1206,\n1213, n. 13 (CA11 1991). As to the Authority\u2019s eminent\ndomain power, it was not exercised here and we do not\n18     FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfind it relevant to the question whether the State author\u00ad\nized hospital authorities to consolidate market power\nthrough potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of exist\u00ad\ning hospitals.\n                               B\n  Finally, respondents contend that to the extent there\nis any doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is\nsatisfied in this context, federal courts should err on the\nside of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interfer\u00ad\nence with state policy choices. See Brief for Respondents\n43\u201344. But we do not find the Law ambiguous on the\nquestion whether it clearly articulates a policy authorizing\nanticompetitive acquisitions; it does not.\n  More fundamentally, respondents\u2019 suggestion is incon\u00ad\nsistent with the principle that \u201cstate-action immunity is\ndisfavored.\u201d Ticor Title, 504 U. S., at 636. Parker and its\nprogeny are premised on an understanding that respect\nfor the States\u2019 coordinate role in government counsels\nagainst reading the federal antitrust laws to restrict the\nStates\u2019 sovereign capacity to regulate their economies and\nprovide services to their citizens. But federalism and state\nsovereignty are poorly served by a rule of construction\nthat would allow \u201cessential national policies\u201d embodied in\nthe antitrust laws to be displaced by state delegations of\nauthority \u201cintended to achieve more limited ends.\u201d 504\nU. S., at 636. As an amici brief filed by 20 States in sup\u00ad\nport of the FTC contends, loose application of the clear\u00ad\narticulation test would attach significant unintended\nconsequences to States\u2019 frequent delegations of corporate\nauthority to local bodies, effectively requiring States to\ndisclaim any intent to displace competition to avoid inad\u00ad\nvertently authorizing anticompetitive conduct.

Argued November 26, 2012\u2014Decided February 19, 2013\nUnder Georgia\u2019s Hospital Authorities Law (Law), political subdivisions\n may create special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities\n to provide \u201cfor the operation and maintenance of needed health care\n facilities in the several counties and municipalities of th[e] state.\u201d\n The Law permits authorities to \u201cexercise public and essential gov-\n ernmental functions\u201d and delegates to them numerous general pow-\n ers, including the ability to acquire and lease hospitals and other\n public health facilities. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375.\n    The Hospital Authority of Albany-Dougherty County (Authority)\n owns Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital (Memorial), one of two hos-\n pitals in the county. The Authority formed two private nonprofit cor-\n porations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.\n (PPHS) and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc. (PPMH). After\n the Authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county\n and lease it to a subsidiary of PPHS, the Federal Trade Commission\n (FTC) issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transac-\n tion would substantially reduce competition in the market for acute-\n care hospital services, in violation of \u00a75 of the Federal Trade Com-\n mission Act and \u00a77 of the Clayton Act. The FTC and Georgia subse-\n quently sued the Authority, PPHS, PPMH, and others (collectively\n respondents), seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administra-\n tive proceedings. The District Court denied the request for a prelim-\n inary injunction and granted respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss, holding\n that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the state-\n action doctrine. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It concluded that the\n Authority, as a local governmental entity, was entitled to state-action\n immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a fore-\n2          FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    seeable result of the Law. The court reasoned that the state legisla-\n    ture could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect, given\n    the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities, particu-\n    larly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation\n    of hospital ownership.\nHeld: Because Georgia has not clearly articulated and affirmatively\n expressed a policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions\n that substantially lessen competition, state-action immunity does not\n apply. Pp. 6\u201319.\n    (a) This Court recognized in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, 350\u2013\n 352, that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent States from impos-\n ing market restraints \u201cas an act of government . . . .\u201d Under the\n state-action doctrine, immunity from federal antitrust law may ex-\n tend to nonstate actors carrying out the State\u2019s regulatory program.\n See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94, 99\u2013100. But given the anti-\n trust laws\u2019 values of free enterprise and economic competition, \u201cstate-\n action immunity is disfavored,\u201d FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U. S.\n 621, 636, and is recognized only when it is clear that the challenged\n anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to the \u201cState\u2019s own\u201d\n regulatory scheme, id., at 635. Immunity will attach only to activi-\n ties of substate governmental entities that are undertaken pursuant\n to a \u201cclearly articulated and affirmatively expressed\u201d state policy to\n displace competition. Community Communications Co. v. Boulder,\n 455 U. S. 40, 52. A state legislature need not \u201cexpressly state\u201d that\n intent, Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 43, but the anticompetitive\n effect must have been the \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of what the State au-\n thorized, id., at 42. Pp. 6\u20139.\n    (b) Respondents\u2019 state-action immunity defense fails under the\n clear-articulation test because there is no evidence the State affirma-\n tively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competi-\n tion by consolidating hospital ownership. The Authority\u2019s powers, in-\n cluding its acquisition and leasing powers, mirror general powers\n routinely conferred by state law on private corporations. More is re-\n quired to establish state-action immunity; the Authority must show\n that it has been delegated authority not just to act, but to act or regu-\n late anticompetitively. Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,\n 499 U. S. 365, 372. In Boulder, this Court concluded that a Colorado\n law granting municipalities the power to enact ordinances governing\n local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test, 455 U. S., at\n 55\u201356, because, when a State\u2019s position \u201cis one of mere neutrality re-\n specting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive,\u201d the\n State cannot be said to have \u201c \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d those anticompetitive\n actions, id., at 55.\n    That principle controls here.

Here, though the Law allows the\nAuthority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and af-\nfirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to make\nacquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen com-\npetition. Pp. 9\u201310.\n   (c) In concluding otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit applied the con-\ncept of \u201cforeseeability\u201d too loosely. This Court, recognizing that no\nlegislature \u201ccan be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects\u201d of\na statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity,\nHallie, 471 U. S., at 43, has approached the clear-articulation inquiry\npractically, but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the\nState must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of\ncompetition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be\nattributed to the \u201cstate itself,\u201d Parker, 317 U. S., at 352. Thus, the\nCourt has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was\nsufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the\ninherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority dele-\ngated by the state legislature. In that scenario, the State must have\nforeseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as con-\nsistent with its policy goals. See Hallie, 471 U. S., at 41; Omni, 499\nU. S., at 373. By contrast, when a State grants an entity a general\npower to act, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.\nEntities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their\npowers anticompetitively, but a reasonable legislature\u2019s ability to an-\nticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an af-\nfirmative state policy to displace competition. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s\nargument, echoed by respondents, that the case falls within the fore-\nseeability standard used in Hallie and Omni is rejected. Pp. 11\u201314.\n   (d) Respondents\u2019 additional arguments are also unpersuasive.\nThey contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique\npowers and responsibilities to fulfill Georgia\u2019s objective of providing\naccess to adequate and affordable health care, it was foreseeable that\nthey would decide that the best way to serve their communities was\nto acquire an existing local hospital, instead of incurring the addi-\ntional expense and regulatory burden of expanding, or constructing, a\nfacility. But even though the authorities may differ from private cor-\nporations offering hospital services, neither the Law nor any other\nstate-law provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authori-\nties to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anti-\ncompetitive effects. Respondents also contend that when there is\ndoubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied, federal\n4          FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid im-\n    proper interference with state policy choices. But the Law here is not\n    ambiguous, and respondents\u2019 suggestion is inconsistent with the\n    principle that \u201cstate-action immunity is disfavored,\u201d Ticor Title, 504\n    U.

In this case, we must decide\nwhether a Georgia law that creates special-purpose public\nentities called hospital authorities and gives those entities\ngeneral corporate powers, including the power to acquire\nhospitals, clearly articulates and affirmatively expresses a\nstate policy to permit acquisitions that substantially lessen\ncompetition. Because Georgia\u2019s grant of general cor-\nporate powers to hospital authorities does not include\npermission to use those powers anticompetitively, we hold\nthat the clear-articulation test is not satisfied and state\u00ad\naction immunity does not apply.\n                              I\n                             A\n  In 1941, the State of Georgia amended its Constitution\nto allow political subdivisions to provide health care ser\u00ad\n2       FTC v.

As amended, the Law authorizes each county\nand municipality, and certain combinations of counties\nor municipalities, to create \u201ca public body corporate and\npolitic\u201d called a \u201chospital authority.\u201d \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201372(a), (d).\nHospital authorities are governed by 5- to 9-member\nboards that are appointed by the governing body of the\ncounty or municipality in their area of operation. \u00a731\u20137\u2013\n72(a).\n   Under the Law, a hospital authority \u201cexercise[s] public\nand essential governmental functions\u201d and is delegated\n\u201call the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and\neffectuate\u201d the Law\u2019s purposes. \u00a731\u20137\u201375.

In 1990, the Authority restructured its\noperations by forming two private nonprofit corporations\nto manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.\n(PPHS), and its subsidiary, Phoebe Putney Memorial\nHospital, Inc. (PPMH). The Authority leased Memorial\nto PPMH for $1 per year for 40 years. Under the lease,\nPPMH has exclusive authority over the operation of Me\u00ad\nmorial, including the ability to set rates for services.\nConsistent with \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7), PPMH is subject to lease\nconditions that require provision of care to the indigent\nsick and limit its rate of return.\n   Memorial is one of two hospitals in Dougherty County.\nThe second, Palmyra Medical Center (Palmyra), was estab\u00ad\nlished in Albany in 1971 and is located just two miles\nfrom Memorial. At the time suit was brought in this case,\nPalmyra was operated by a national for-profit hospital\nnetwork, HCA, Inc. (HCA). Together, Memorial and Pal\u00ad\nmyra account for 86 percent of the market for acute-care\nhospital services provided to commercial health care plans\nand their customers in the six counties surrounding Al-\nbany. Memorial accounts for 75 percent of that market on\nits own.\n   In 2010, PPHS began discussions with HCA about\nacquiring Palmyra. Following negotiations, PPHS pre\u00ad\nsented the Authority with a plan under which the Author\u00ad\nity would purchase Palmyra with PPHS controlled funds\nand then lease Palmyra to a PPHS subsidiary for $1 per\nyear under the Memorial lease agreement.

S. C. \u00a745, and \u00a77 of the Clayton Act, 38\nStat. 731, 15 U. S. C. \u00a718. The FTC, along with the State\nof Georgia,1 subsequently filed suit against the Authority,\nHCA, Palmyra, PPHS, PPMH, and the new PPHS subsid\u00ad\niary created to manage Palmyra (collectively respondents),\nseeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative\nproceedings.

But the court con\u00ad\ncluded that the transaction was immune from antitrust\nliability. See id., at 1375\u20131378. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that as a local governmental entity, the Author\u00ad\nity was entitled to state-action immunity if the challenged\nanticompetitive conduct was a \u201c \u2018foreseeable result\u2019 \u201d of\nGeorgia\u2019s legislation.

Hospital\nBd. of Directors of Lee Cty., 38 F. 3d 1184, 1188, 1190\u2013\n1191 (CA11 1994)). Applying that standard, the Court of\nAppeals concluded that the Law contemplated the anti\u00ad\ncompetitive conduct challenged by the FTC. The court\nnoted the \u201cimpressive breadth\u201d of the powers given to\nhospital authorities, which include traditional powers of\nprivate corporations and a few additional capabilities,\nsuch as the power to exercise eminent domain. See 663\nF. 3d, at 1376. More specifically, the court reasoned that\nthe Georgia Legislature must have anticipated that the\ngrant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease\nprojects would produce anticompetitive effects because\n\u201c[f]oreseeably, acquisitions could consolidate ownership\nof competing hospitals, eliminating competition between\nthem.\u201d Id., at 1377.2\n    The Court of Appeals also rejected the FTC\u2019s alternative\nargument that state-action immunity did not apply be\u00ad\ncause the transaction in substance involved a transfer of\ncontrol over Palmyra from one private entity to another,\nwith the Authority acting as a mere conduit for the sale to\nevade antitrust liability.

See 567\nU. S. ___ (2012). Concluding that the answer to the first\nquestion is \u201cno,\u201d we reverse without reaching the second\nquestion.3\n                             II\n  In Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), this Court\nheld that because \u201cnothing in the language of the Sher\u00ad\nman Act [15 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.] or in its history\u201d suggested\nthat Congress intended to restrict the sovereign capacity\nof the States to regulate their economies, the Act should\nnot be read to bar States from imposing market restraints\n\u201cas an act of government.\u201d Id., at 350, 352. Following\nParker, we have held that under certain circumstances,\nimmunity from the federal antitrust laws may extend to\nnonstate actors carrying out the State\u2019s regulatory pro\u00ad\ngram.

Ticor\nTitle Ins. Co., 504 U. S. 621, 636 (1992). Consistent with\nthis preference, we recognize state-action immunity only\nwhen it is clear that the challenged anticompetitive con\u00ad\nduct is undertaken pursuant to a regulatory scheme that\n\u201cis the State\u2019s own.\u201d Id., at 635.

When determining whether\nthe anticompetitive acts of private parties are entitled\nto immunity, we employ a two-part test, requiring first\nthat \u201cthe challenged restraint . . . be one clearly articu\u00ad\nlated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,\u201d and second\nthat \u201cthe policy . . . be actively supervised by the State.\u201d\nCalifornia Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Alumi-\nnum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105 (1980) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   This case involves allegedly anticompetitive conduct\nundertaken by a substate governmental entity.

PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstate governmental entity must also show that it has\nbeen delegated authority to act or regulate anticompeti\u00ad\ntively. See Omni, 499 U. S., at 372. In Boulder, we held\nthat Colorado\u2019s Home Rule Amendment allowing munici\u00ad\npalities to govern local affairs did not satisfy the clear\u00ad\narticulation test. 455 U. S., at 55\u201356. There was no doubt\nin that case that the city had authority as a matter of\nstate law to pass an ordinance imposing a moratorium on\na cable provider\u2019s expansion of service. Id., at 45\u201346. But\nwe rejected the proposition that \u201cthe general grant of\npower to enact ordinances necessarily implies state au\u00ad\nthorization to enact specific anticompetitive ordinances\u201d\nbecause such an approach \u201cwould wholly eviscerate the\nconcepts of \u2018clear articulation and affirmative expression\u2019\nthat our precedents require.\u201d Id., at 56. We explained\nthat when a State\u2019s position \u201cis one of mere neutrality\nrespecting the municipal actions challenged as anticom\u00ad\npetitive,\u201d the State cannot be said to have \u201c \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d\nthose anticompetitive actions. Id., at 55.\n   The principle articulated in Boulder controls this case.\nGrants of general corporate power that allow substate\ngovernmental entities to participate in a competitive\nmarketplace should be, can be, and typically are used in\nways that raise no federal antitrust concerns. As a result,\na State that has delegated such general powers \u201ccan\nhardly be said to have \u2018contemplated\u2019 \u201d that they will be\nused anticompetitively. Ibid. See also 1A P.

Thus, while the Law does allow the Authority\nto acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and\naffirmatively express a state policy empowering the Au\u00ad\nthority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will\nsubstantially lessen competition.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Ibid. Instead, we have\napproached the clear-articulation inquiry more practically,\nbut without diluting the ultimate requirement that the\nState must have affirmatively contemplated the displace\u00ad\nment of competition such that the challenged anticompeti\u00ad\ntive effects can be attributed to the \u201cstate itself.\u201d Parker,\n317 U. S., at 352. Thus, we have concluded that a state\npolicy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently\nexpressed where the displacement of competition was the\ninherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of\nauthority delegated by the state legislature. In that sce\u00ad\nnario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly en\u00ad\ndorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its\npolicy goals.\n   For example, in Hallie, Wisconsin statutory law regulat\u00ad\ning the municipal provision of sewage services expressly\npermitted cities to limit their service to surrounding unin\u00ad\ncorporated areas. See 471 U. S., at 41. While unincorpo\u00ad\nrated towns alleged that the city\u2019s exercise of that power\nconstituted an unlawful tying arrangement, an unlawful\nrefusal to deal, and an abuse of monopoly power, we had\nno trouble concluding that these alleged anticompetitive\n12       FTC v.

Id., at 42. As described by the\nWisconsin Supreme Court, the state legislature \u201c \u2018viewed\nannexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated\narea as a reasonable quid pro quo that a city could require\nbefore extending sewer services to the area.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 44\u2013\n45, n. 8 (quoting Hallie v.

W. 2d 321, 325 (1982)). Without\nimmunity, federal antitrust law could have undermined\nthat arrangement and taken completely off the table the\npolicy option that the State clearly intended for cities to\nhave.\n  Similarly, in Omni, where the respondents alleged that\nthe city had used its zoning power to protect an incumbent\nbillboard provider against competition, we found that the\nclear-articulation test was easily satisfied even though the\nstate statutes delegating zoning authority to the city did\nnot explicitly permit the suppression of competition. We\nexplained that \u201c[t]he very purpose of zoning regulation is\nto displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that\nregularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of com\u00ad\npetition\u201d and that a zoning ordinance regulating the size,\nlocation, and spacing of billboards \u201cnecessarily protects\nexisting billboards against some competition from new\u00ad\ncomers.\u201d 499 U.

Other cases in which we have\nfound a \u201cclear articulation\u201d of the State\u2019s intent to displace\ncompetition without an explicit statement have also in\u00ad\nvolved authorizations to act or regulate in ways that were\ninherently anticompetitive.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v.

When a State\ngrants some entity general power to act, whether it is a\nprivate corporation or a public entity like the Authority, it\ndoes so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law. See\nTicor Title, 504 U. S., at 632. Of course, both private\nparties and local governmental entities conceivably may\ntransgress antitrust requirements by exercising their\ngeneral powers in anticompetitive ways. But a reasonable\nlegislature\u2019s ability to anticipate that (potentially undesir\u00ad\nable) possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an\naffirmative state policy to displace competition with a\nregulatory alternative.\n  Believing that this case falls within the scope of the\nforeseeability standard applied in Hallie and Omni, the\nCourt of Appeals stated that \u201c[i]t defies imagination to\nsuppose the [state] legislature could have believed that\nevery geographic market in Georgia was so replete with\nhospitals that authorizing acquisitions by the authorities\ncould have no serious anticompetitive consequences.\u201d 663\nF. 3d, at 1377.

Section 31\u20137\u201375(4) allows authorities to acquire\n\u201cprojects,\u201d which includes not only \u201chospitals,\u201d but also\n\u201chealth care facilities, dormitories, office buildings, clinics,\nhousing accommodations, nursing homes, rehabilitation\ncenters, extended care facilities, and other public health\nfacilities.\u201d \u00a731\u20137\u201371(5). Narrowing our focus to the mar\u00ad\nket for hospital services, the power to acquire hospitals\nstill does not ordinarily produce anticompetitive effects.\nSection 31\u20137\u201375(4) was, after all, the source of power for\nnewly formed hospital authorities to acquire a hospital in\nthe first instance\u2014a transaction that was unlikely to raise\nany antitrust concerns even in small markets because the\ntransfer of ownership from private to public hands does\nnot increase market concentration. See 1A Areeda &\nHovenkamp \u00b6224e(c), at 126 (\u201c[S]ubstitution of one mo\u00ad\nnopolist for another is not an antitrust violation\u201d). While\nsubsequent acquisitions by authorities have the potential\nto reduce competition, they will raise federal antitrust\nconcerns only in markets that are large enough to support\nmore than one hospital but sufficiently small that the\nmerger of competitors would lead to a significant increase\nin market concentration. This is too slender a reed to\nsupport the Court of Appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 inference.\n                           IV\n                            A\n Taking a somewhat different approach than the Court of\nAppeals, respondents insist that the Law should not be\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   15\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nread as a mere authorization for hospital authorities to\nparticipate in the hospital-services market and exercise\ngeneral corporate powers. Rather, they contend that hos\u00ad\npital authorities are granted unique powers and respon-\nsibilities to fulfill the State\u2019s objective of providing all\nresidents with access to adequate and affordable health\nand hospital care. See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201375(22).\nRespondents argue that in view of hospital authorities\u2019\nstatutory objective, their specific attributes, and the regu\u00ad\nlatory context in which they operate, it was foreseeable\nthat authorities facing capacity constraints would decide\nthey could best serve their communities\u2019 needs by acquir\u00ad\ning an existing local hospital rather than incur the addi\u00ad\ntional expense and regulatory burden of expanding a\nfacility or constructing a new one. See Brief for Respond\u00ad\nents 33\u201339.\n   In support of this argument, respondents observe that\nhospital authorities are simultaneously empowered to act\nin ways private entities cannot while also being subject to\nsignificant regulatory constraints. On the power side, as\nthe Court of Appeals noted, 663 F. 3d, at 1376\u20131377,\nhospital authorities may acquire through eminent domain\nproperty that is \u201cessential to the [authority\u2019s] purposes.\u201d\n\u00a731\u20137\u201375(12).8 On the restraint side, hospital authorities\nare managed by a publicly accountable board, \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u2013\n74.1, 31\u20137\u201376, they must operate on a nonprofit basis,\n\u00a731\u20137\u201377, and they may only lease a project for others to\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The Court of Appeals also invoked Ga. Code Ann. \u00a731\u20137\u201384, which\n\nprovides that hospital authorities do not have the power to assess\ntaxes, but allows the applicable governing body in the authority\u2019s area\nof operation to impose taxes to cover the authority\u2019s expenses. See 663\nF. 3d, at 1377. This provision applies in cases in which the county or\nmunicipality has entered into a contract with a hospital authority for\nthe use of its facilities. See \u00a7\u00a731\u20137\u201384(a), 31\u20137\u201385. No such contract\nexists in this case, and respondents have not relied on this provision in\nbriefing or argument before us.\n16        FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\noperate after determining that doing so will promote the\ncommunity\u2019s public health needs and that the lessee will\nnot receive more than a reasonable rate of return on its\ninvestment, \u00a731\u20137\u201375(7). Moreover, hospital authorities\noperate within a broader regulatory context in which\nGeorgia requires any party seeking to establish or signifi\u00ad\ncantly expand certain medical facilities, including hospi\u00ad\ntals, to obtain a certificate of need from state regulators.\nSee \u00a731\u20136\u201340 et seq.9\n   We have no doubt that Georgia\u2019s hospital authorities\ndiffer materially from private corporations that offer\nhospital services. But nothing in the Law or any other\nprovision of Georgia law clearly articulates a state policy\nto allow authorities to exercise their general corporate\npowers, including their acquisition power, without regard\nto negative effects on competition. The state legislature\u2019s\nobjective of improving access to affordable health care does\nnot logically suggest that the State intended that hospital\nauthorities pursue that end through mergers that create\nmonopolies. Nor do the restrictions imposed on hospital\nauthorities, including the requirement that they operate\non a nonprofit basis, reveal such a policy. Particularly in\nlight of our national policy favoring competition, these\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Georgia  first adopted certificate of need legislation in 1978 in part to\ncomply with a since-repealed federal law conditioning federal funding\nfor a number of health care programs on a State\u2019s enactment of certifi\u00ad\ncate of need laws. See 1978 Ga. Laws p. 941, as amended, Ga. Code\nAnn. \u00a731\u20136\u201340 et seq. (2012); see also National Health Planning and\nResources Development Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2246, repealed by \u00a7701(a),\n100 Stat. 3799. Many other States also have certificate of need laws.\nSee National Conference of State Legislatures, Certificate of Need:\nState Health Laws and Programs, online at http://www.ncsl.org/issues\u00ad\nresearch/health/con-certificate-of-need-state-laws.aspx (as visited Feb.\n15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (indicating in\n\u201cStates with CON Programs\u201d table that 35 States retained some type of\ncertificate of need program as of December 2011 while 15 other States\nhad such programs but have repealed them).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrestrictions should be read to reflect more modest aims.\nThe legislature may have viewed profit generation as\nincompatible with its goal of providing care for the indi\u00ad\ngent sick. In addition, the legislature may have believed\nthat some hospital authorities would operate in markets\nwith characteristics of natural monopolies, in which case\nthe legislature could not rely on competition to control\nprices. See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579,\n595\u2013596 (1976).\n  We recognize that Georgia, particularly through its\ncertificate of need requirement, does limit competition in\nthe market for hospital services in some respects. But\nregulation of an industry, and even the authorization of\ndiscrete forms of anticompetitive conduct pursuant to a\nregulatory structure, does not establish that the State has\naffirmatively contemplated other forms of anticompetitive\nconduct that are only tangentially related. Thus, in Gold-\nfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773 (1975), we re-\njected a state-action defense to price-fixing claims where a\nstate bar adopted a compulsory minimum fee schedule.\nAlthough the State heavily regulated the practice of law,\nwe found no evidence that it had adopted a policy to dis\u00ad\nplace price competition among lawyers. Id., at 788\u2013792.\nAnd in Cantor, we concluded that a state commission\u2019s\nregulation of rates for electricity charged by a public utili\u00ad\nty did not confer state-action immunity for a claim that\nthe utility\u2019s free distribution of light bulbs restrained\ntrade in the light-bulb market. 428 U. S., at 596.\n  In this case, the fact that Georgia imposes limits on\nentry into the market for medical services, which apply to\nboth hospital authorities and private corporations, does\nnot clearly articulate a policy favoring the consolidation of\nexisting hospitals that are engaged in active competition.\nAccord, FTC v. University Health, Inc., 938 F. 2d 1206,\n1213, n. 13 (CA11 1991). As to the Authority\u2019s eminent\ndomain power, it was not exercised here and we do not\n18     FTC v. PHOEBE PUTNEY HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfind it relevant to the question whether the State author\u00ad\nized hospital authorities to consolidate market power\nthrough potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of exist\u00ad\ning hospitals.\n                               B\n  Finally, respondents contend that to the extent there\nis any doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is\nsatisfied in this context, federal courts should err on the\nside of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interfer\u00ad\nence with state policy choices. See Brief for Respondents\n43\u201344. But we do not find the Law ambiguous on the\nquestion whether it clearly articulates a policy authorizing\nanticompetitive acquisitions; it does not.\n  More fundamentally, respondents\u2019 suggestion is incon\u00ad\nsistent with the principle that \u201cstate-action immunity is\ndisfavored.\u201d Ticor Title, 504 U. S., at 636. Parker and its\nprogeny are premised on an understanding that respect\nfor the States\u2019 coordinate role in government counsels\nagainst reading the federal antitrust laws to restrict the\nStates\u2019 sovereign capacity to regulate their economies and\nprovide services to their citizens. But federalism and state\nsovereignty are poorly served by a rule of construction\nthat would allow \u201cessential national policies\u201d embodied in\nthe antitrust laws to be displaced by state delegations of\nauthority \u201cintended to achieve more limited ends.\u201d 504\nU. S., at 636. As an amici brief filed by 20 States in sup\u00ad\nport of the FTC contends, loose application of the clear\u00ad\narticulation test would attach significant unintended\nconsequences to States\u2019 frequent delegations of corporate\nauthority to local bodies, effectively requiring States to\ndisclaim any intent to displace competition to avoid inad\u00ad\nvertently authorizing anticompetitive conduct.
