CHAFIN\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11\u20131347. Argued December 5, 2012\u2014Decided February 19, 2013\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-\n  duction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Con-\n  tracting State to order a child returned to her country of habitual res-\n  idence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully\n  removed to or retained in the Contracting State. The International\n  Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) implements the Convention\n  in the United States, granting federal and state courts concurrent ju-\n  risdiction over Convention actions and directing those courts to de-\n  cide cases in accordance with the Convention. ICARA also requires\n  defendants to pay various expenses incurred by plaintiffs associated\n  with the return of children.\n     Petitioner Mr. Chafin, a United States citizen and member of the\n  military, married respondent Ms. Chafin, a United Kingdom citizen,\n  in Germany, where they later had a daughter, E. C. When Mr. Chaf-\n  in was deployed to Afghanistan, Ms. Chafin took E. C. to Scotland.\n  Mr. Chafin was later transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Ms.\n  Chafin eventually traveled there with E. C. Soon after Ms. Chafin\u2019s\n  arrival, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and child custody in Alabama.\n  Ms. Chafin was subsequently deported, but E. C. remained in Ala-\n  bama with Mr. Chafin. Several months later, Ms. Chafin filed a peti-\n  tion under the Convention and ICARA, seeking E. C.\u2019s return to Scot-\n  land. The District Court concluded that E. C.\u2019s country of habitual\n  residence was Scotland and granted the petition for return. Ms.\n  Chafin immediately departed for Scotland with E. C. Ms. Chafin\n  then initiated custody proceedings in Scotland and was granted inter-\n  im custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mr. Chafin from\n  removing E. C. from Scotland. Mr. Chafin appealed the District\n  Court\u2019s order, but the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot,\n2                          CHAFIN v.CHAFIN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    on the ground that once a child has been returned to a foreign coun-\n    try, a U. S. court becomes powerless to grant relief. On remand, the\n    District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for court\n    costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and travel expenses.\nHeld: The return of a child to a foreign country pursuant to a Conven-\n tion return order does not render an appeal of that order moot.\n Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) Article III restricts the power of federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and\n \u201cControversies,\u201d and this \u201crequirement subsists through all stages of\n [the] proceedings,\u201d Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472,\n 477. No case or controversy exists, and a suit becomes moot, \u201cwhen\n the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally\n cognizable interest in the outcome,\u201d Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568\n U. S. ___, ___. But a case \u201cbecomes moot only when it is impossible\n for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing\n party,\u201d Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___, ___. As \u201clong as the\n parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the\n litigation, the case is not moot,\u201d ibid. Pp. 5\u20136.\n    (b) Because the Chafins continue to vigorously contest the question\n of where their daughter will be raised, this dispute is very much\n alive. This case does not address \u201ca hypothetical state of facts,\u201d Lew-\n is, supra, at 477, and there continues to exist between the parties\n \u201cthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of is-\n sues,\u201d Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 6\u201311.\n      (1) Mr. Chafin seeks typical appellate relief: reversal of the Dis-\n trict Court determination that E. C.\u2019s habitual residence was Scot-\n land and, upon reversal, an order that E. C. be returned to the Unit-\n ed States. The question is whether such relief would be effectual. In\n arguing that this case is moot because the District Court has no au-\n thority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pur-\n suant to its inherent equitable powers, Ms. Chafin confuses mootness\n with the merits. See, e.g., Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 500.\n Mr. Chafin\u2019s claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausi-\n ble that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, and his prospects of\n success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry. As to the\n effectiveness of any relief, even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return\n order, this case would not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have\n personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin and may command her to take\n action under threat of sanctions. She could decide to comply with an\n order against her and return E. C. to the United States. Enforcement\n of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but\n such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot. Pp. 7\u201310.\n      (2) Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the District\n Court\u2019s expense orders. That too is common relief on appeal, and the\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  mootness inquiry comes down to its effectiveness. In contending that\n  this case is moot due to Mr. Chafin\u2019s failure to pursue an appeal of\n  the expense orders, which were entered as separate judgments, Ms.\n  Chafin again confuses mootness with the merits. Because there is\n  authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments\n  separately does not preclude relief, it is for lower courts at later stag-\n  es of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to\n  the relief he seeks. That relief would not be \u201c \u2018fully satisfactory,\u2019 \u201d but\n  \u201ceven the availability of a \u2018partial remedy\u2019 is \u2018sufficient to prevent [a]\n  case from being moot,\u2019 \u201d Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150.\n  Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (c) Manipulating constitutional doctrine and holding these cases\n  moot is not necessary to achieve the ends of the Convention and IC-\n  ARA, and may undermine the treaty\u2019s goals and harm the children\n  meant to be protected. If these cases were to become moot upon re-\n  turn, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,\n  to prevent the loss of any right to appeal. Such routine stays would\n  conflict with the Convention\u2019s mandate of prompt return. Courts\n  should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to\n  stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434, thus\n  ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment\n  necessary for appropriate consideration of the child\u2019s best interests.\n  Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should\n  take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.

S. Army. While\nstationed in Germany in 2006, he married respondent\nLynne Hales Chafin, a citizen of the United Kingdom.\nTheir daughter E. C. was born the following year.\n  Later in 2007, Mr. Chafin was deployed to Afghanistan,\n4                   CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Ms. Chafin took E. C. to Scotland. Mr. Chafin was\neventually transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and in\nFebruary 2010, Ms. Chafin traveled to Alabama with E. C.\nSoon thereafter, however, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and\nfor child custody in Alabama state court. Towards the end\nof the year, Ms. Chafin was arrested for domestic violence,\nan incident that alerted U. S. Citizenship and Immigra\u00ad\ntion Services to the fact that she had overstayed her visa.\nShe was deported in February 2011, and E. C. remained in\nMr. Chafin\u2019s care for several more months.\n   In May 2011, Ms. Chafin initiated this case in the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Alabama. She\nfiled a petition under the Convention and ICARA seeking\nan order for E. C.\u2019s return to Scotland. On October 11 and\n12, 2011, the District Court held a bench trial. Upon the\nclose of arguments, the court ruled in favor of Ms. Chafin,\nconcluding that E. C.\u2019s country of habitual residence was\nScotland and granting the petition for return. Mr. Chafin\nimmediately moved for a stay pending appeal, but the\ncourt denied his request. Within hours, Ms. Chafin left\nthe country with E. C., headed for Scotland. By December\n2011, she had initiated custody proceedings there. The\nScottish court soon granted her interim custody and a\npreliminary injunction, prohibiting Mr. Chafin from re\u00ad\nmoving E. C. from Scotland. In the meantime, Mr. Chafin\nhad appealed the District Court order to the Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n   In February 2012, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mr.\nChafin\u2019s appeal as moot in a one-paragraph order, citing\nBekier v. Bekier, 248 F. 3d 1051 (2001). App. to Pet. for\nCert. 1\u20132. In Bekier, the Eleventh Circuit had concluded\nthat an appeal of a Convention return order was moot\nwhen the child had been returned to the foreign country,\nbecause the court \u201cbecame powerless\u201d to grant relief. 248\nF. 3d, at 1055. In accordance with Bekier, the Court of\nAppeals remanded this case to the District Court with\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Meanwhile, the\nAlabama state court had dismissed the child custody\nproceeding initiated by Mr. Chafin for lack of jurisdiction.\nThe Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, relying in\npart on the U. S. District Court\u2019s finding that the child\u2019s\nhabitual residence was not Alabama, but Scotland.\n  We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. 567 U.

In short,\nMr. Chafin is asking for typical appellate relief: that the\nCourt of Appeals reverse the District Court and that the\nDistrict Court undo what it has done. See Arkadelphia\nMilling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., 249 U. S.\n134, 145\u2013146 (1919); Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, 139\nU. S. 216, 219 (1891) (\u201cJurisdiction to correct what had\nbeen wrongfully done must remain with the court so long\nas the parties and the case are properly before it, either in\nthe first instance or when remanded to it by an appellate\ntribunal\u201d). The question is whether such relief would be\neffectual in this case.\n   Ms. Chafin argues that this case is moot because the\nDistrict Court lacks the authority to issue a re-return\norder either under the Convention or pursuant to its in-\nherent equitable powers. But that argument\u2014which\ngoes to the meaning of the Convention and the legal avail\u00ad\nability of a certain kind of relief\u2014confuses mootness with\nthe merits. In Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486 (1969),\nthis Court held that a claim for backpay saved the case\nfrom mootness, even though the defendants argued that\nthe backpay claim had been brought in the wrong court\nand therefore could not result in relief. As the Court\n8                        CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained, \u201cthis argument . . . confuses mootness with\nwhether [the plaintiff] has established a right to recover\n. . . , a question which it is inappropriate to treat at this\nstage of the litigation.\u201d Id., at 500. Mr. Chafin\u2019s claim\nfor re-return\u2014under the Convention itself or according to\ngeneral equitable principles\u2014cannot be dismissed as so\nimplausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction,\nsee Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.\n83, 89 (1998), and his prospects of success are therefore\nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\n    As to the effectiveness of any relief, Ms. Chafin asserts\nthat even if the habitual residence ruling were reversed\nand the District Court were to issue a re-return order, that\nrelief would be ineffectual because Scotland would simply\nignore it.1 But even if Scotland were to ignore a U. S. re\u00ad\nreturn order, or decline to assist in enforcing it, this case\nwould not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have\npersonal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin, may command her\nto take action even outside the United States, and may\nback up any such command with sanctions. See Steele v.\nBulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280, 289 (1952); cf. Leman v.\nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U. S. 448, 451\u2013452\n(1932). No law of physics prevents E. C.\u2019s return from\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Whether Scotland would do so is unclear; Ms. Chafin cited no au\u00ad\n\nthority for her assertion in her brief or at oral argument. In a recently\nissued decision from the Family Division of the High Court of Justice\nof England and Wales, a judge of that court rejected the \u201cconcept of\nautomatic re-return of a child in response to the overturn of [a] Hague\norder.\u201d DL v. EL, [2013] EWHC 49, \u00b659 (Judgt. of Jan. 17). The judge\nin that case did not ignore the pertinent re-return order\u2014issued by the\nDistrict Court in Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d 295 (CA5 2012), cert.\npending, No. 12\u2013304\u2014but did not consider it binding in light of the\nproceedings in England.\n  Earlier in those proceedings, the Family Division of the High Court\ndirected the parties to provide this Court with a joint statement on\nthe status of those proceedings. This Court is grateful for that\nconsideration.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nScotland, see Fawcett v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 496\n(CA4 2003), abrogated on other grounds by Abbott v.\nAbbott, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), and Ms. Chafin might decide\nto comply with an order against her and return E. C. to\nthe United States, see, e.g., Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d\n295, 303\u2013304 (CA5 2012) (mother who had taken child\nto United Kingdom complied with Texas court sanctions\norder and order to return child to United States for trial),\ncert. pending, No. 12\u2013304.2 After all, the consequence of\ncompliance presumably would not be relinquishment of\ncustody rights, but simply custody proceedings in a differ\u00ad\nent forum.\n   Enforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Cha-\nfin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typi\u00ad\ncally render cases moot. Courts often adjudicate disputes\nwhere the practical impact of any decision is not assured.\nFor example, courts issue default judgments against de\u00ad\nfendants who failed to appear or participate in the pro\u00ad\nceedings and therefore seem less likely to comply. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55. Similarly, the fact that a defend\u00ad\nant is insolvent does not moot a claim for damages. See\n13C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a73533.3, p. 3 (3d ed. 2008) (cases not moot\n\u201ceven though the defendant does not seem able to pay any\nportion of the damages claimed\u201d). Courts also decide cases\nagainst foreign nations, whose choices to respect final\nrulings are not guaranteed. See, e.g., Republic of Austria\nv. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677 (2004) (suit against Austria for\nreturn of paintings); Republic of Argentina v. Weltover,\nInc., 504 U. S. 607 (1992) (suit against Argentina for\nrepayment of bonds). And we have heard the Govern\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Ms. Chafin suggests that the Scottish court\u2019s ne exeat order prohib\u00ad\nits E. C. from leaving Scotland. The ne exeat order, however, only\nprohibits Mr. Chafin from removing E. C. from Scotland; it does not\nconstrain Ms. Chafin in the same way.\n10                         CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nment\u2019s appeal from the reversal of a conviction, even\nthough the defendants had been deported, reducing the\npractical impact of any decision; we concluded that the\ncase was not moot because the defendants might \u201cre-enter\nthis country on their own\u201d and encounter the consequences\nof our ruling. United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462\nU. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983).\n  So too here. A re-return order may not result in the\nreturn of E. C. to the United States, just as an order that\nan insolvent defendant pay $100 million may not make\nthe plaintiff rich. But it cannot be said that the parties\nhere have no \u201cconcrete interest\u201d in whether Mr. Chafin\nsecures a re-return order. Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[H]owever\nsmall\u201d that concrete interest may be due to potential\ndifficulties in enforcement, it is not simply a matter of\nacademic debate, and is enough to save this case from\nmootness. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                             B\n  Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s expense orders. The District Court or\u00ad\ndered Mr. Chafin to pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 in court\ncosts, attorney\u2019s fees, and travel expenses. See Civ. No.\n11\u20131461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 15\u201316; Civ. No. 11\u2013\n1461 (ND Ala., June 5, 2012), p. 2. That award was predi\u00ad\ncated on the District Court\u2019s earlier judgment allowing\nMs. Chafin to return with her daughter to Scotland. See\nCiv. No. 11\u20131461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 2\u20133, and\nn. 2.3 Thus, in conjunction with reversal of the judgment,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The award was predicated on the earlier judgment even though that\n\njudgment was vacated. The District Court cited Eleventh Circuit cases\nfor the proposition that if a plaintiff obtains relief before a district court\nand the case becomes moot on appeal, the plaintiff is still a prevailing\nparty entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. We express no view on that question.\nThe fact remains that the District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to pay\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nMr. Chafin desires vacatur of the award. That too is\ncommon relief on appeal, see, e.g., Fawcett, supra, at 501,\nn. 6 (reversing costs and fees award when reversing on the\nissue of wrongful removal), and the mootness inquiry\ncomes down to its effectiveness.\n   At oral argument, Ms. Chafin contended that such relief\nwas \u201cgone in this case,\u201d and that the case was therefore\nmoot, because Mr. Chafin had failed to pursue an appeal\nof the expense orders, which had been entered as separate\njudgments. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see Civ. No. 11\u20131461 (ND\nAla., Mar. 7, 2012); Civ. No. 11\u20131461 (ND Ala., June 5,\n2012). But this is another argument on the merits. Mr.\nChafin\u2019s requested relief is not so implausible that it may\nbe disregarded on the question of jurisdiction; there is\nauthority for the proposition that failure to appeal such\njudgments separately does not preclude relief. See 15B\nWright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, \u00a73915.6, at 230, and\nn. 39.5 (2d ed., Supp. 2012) (citing cases). It is thus for\nlower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide\nwhether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks\u2014\nvacatur of the expense orders.\n   Such relief would of course not be \u201c \u2018fully satisfactory,\u2019 \u201d\nbut with respect to the case as whole, \u201ceven the availabil\u00ad\nity of a \u2018partial remedy\u2019 is \u2018sufficient to prevent [a] case\nfrom being moot.\u2019 \u201d Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150\n(1996) (per curiam) (quoting Church of Scientology, 506\nU. S., at 13).\n                            IV\n  Ms. Chafin is correct to emphasize that both the Hague\nConvention and ICARA stress the importance of the\nprompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained.\nWe are also sympathetic to the concern that shuttling\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nattorney\u2019s fees and travel expenses based on its earlier ruling. A\nreversal, as opposed to vacatur, of the earlier ruling could change the\nprevailing party calculus and afford Mr. Chafin effective relief.\n12                   CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchildren back and forth between parents and across inter\u00ad\nnational borders may be detrimental to those children.\nBut courts can achieve the ends of the Convention and\nICARA\u2014and protect the well-being of the affected chil\u00ad\ndren\u2014through the familiar judicial tools of expediting\nproceedings and granting stays where appropriate. There\nis no need to manipulate constitutional doctrine and hold\nthese cases moot. Indeed, doing so may very well under\u00ad\nmine the goals of the treaty and harm the children it is\nmeant to protect.\n   If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts\nwould be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,\nto prevent the loss of any right to appeal. See, e.g., Garri-\nson v. Hudson, 468 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1984) (Burger, C. J.,\nin chambers) (\u201cWhen . . . the normal course of appellate\nreview might otherwise cause the case to become moot,\nissuance of a stay is warranted\u201d (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Nicolson v. Pappalardo, Civ.\nNo. 10\u20131125 (CA1, Feb. 19, 2010) (\u201cWithout necessarily\nfinding a clear probability that appellant will prevail, we\ngrant the stay because . . . a risk exists that the case could\neffectively be mooted by the child\u2019s departure\u201d). In cases\nin which a stay would not be granted but for the prospect\nof mootness, a child would lose precious months when she\ncould have been readjusting to life in her country of habit\u00ad\nual residence, even though the appeal had little chance of\nsuccess. Such routine stays due to mootness would be\nlikely but would conflict with the Convention\u2019s mandate of\nprompt return to a child\u2019s country of habitual residence.\n   Routine stays could also increase the number of appeals.\nCurrently, only about 15% of Hague Convention cases are\nappealed.

A mootness holding here might\nalso encourage flight in future Hague Convention cases, as\nprevailing parents try to flee the jurisdiction to moot the\ncase. See Bekier, 248 F. 3d, at 1055 (mootness holding \u201cto\nsome degree conflicts with the purposes of the Convention:\nto prevent parents from fleeing jurisdictions to find a more\nfavorable judicial forum\u201d).\n   Courts should apply the four traditional stay factors in\nconsidering whether to stay a return order: \u201c \u2018(1) whether\nthe stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant\nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether\nissuance of the stay will substantially injure the other\nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the\npublic interest lies.\u2019 \u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434\n(2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776\n(1987)). In every case under the Hague Convention, the\nwell-being of a child is at stake; application of the tradi\u00ad\ntional stay factors ensures that each case will receive the\nindividualized treatment necessary for appropriate con\u00ad\nsideration of the child\u2019s best interests.\n   Importantly, whether at the district or appellate court\nlevel, courts can and should take steps to decide these\ncases as expeditiously as possible, for the sake of the\nchildren who find themselves in such an unfortunate\nsituation. Many courts already do so. See Federal Judi\u00ad\ncial Center, J. Garbolino, The 1980 Hague Convention on\nthe Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction: A\nGuide for Judges 116, n. 435 (2012) (listing courts that\nexpedite appeals). Cases in American courts often take\nover two years from filing to resolution; for a six-year-old\nsuch as E. C., that is one-third of her lifetime.

See Convention, Oct. 25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670,\nArts. 1, 3, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99\u201311, p. 7 (Treaty Doc.). To\nthat end, the Convention instructs Contracting States to\nuse \u201cthe most expeditious procedures available\u201d to secure\nthe return of a child wrongfully removed or retained away\nfrom her place of habitual residence. Art. 2, ibid.; see Art.\n11, id., at 9 (indicating six weeks as the target time for\ndecision of a return-order petition); Hague Conference on\nPrivate International Law, Guide to Good Practice Under\nthe Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil\nAspects of International Child Abduction, Part I\u2013Central\nAuthority Practice, \u00a71.5.1, p. 19 (2010) (Guide to Good\nPractice) (\u201cExpeditious procedures are essential at all\nstages of the Convention process.\u201d).

S. C. \u00a711601(a)(4), Congress did\nnot specifically address appeal proceedings in the legisla\u00ad\ntion implementing the Convention. The case before us illus\u00ad\ntrates the protraction likely to ensue when the finality\nof a return order is left in limbo.\n   Upon determining that the daughter of Jeffrey Chafin\nand Lynne Chafin resided in Scotland, the District Court\ndenied Mr. Chafin\u2019s request for a stay pending appeal, and\nauthorized the child\u2019s immediate departure for Scotland.\nThe Eleventh Circuit, viewing the matter as a fait accom-\npli, dismissed the appeal filed by Mr. Chafin as moot.1 As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion explains, the Eleventh Circuit erred in\nholding that the child\u2019s removal to Scotland rendered\nfurther adjudication in the U. S. meaningless. Reversal of\nthe District Court\u2019s return order, I agree, could provide\nMr. Chafin with meaningful relief. A determination that\nthe child\u2019s habitual residence was Alabama, not Scotland,\nwould open the way for an order directing Ms. Chafin to\n\u201cre-return\u201d the child to the United States and for Mr.\nChafin to seek a custody adjudication in an Alabama state\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to vacate the\nreturn order, thus leaving the child\u2019s habitual residence undetermined.\nThe Convention envisions an adjudication of habitual residence by the\nreturn forum so that the forum abroad may proceed, immediately, to\nthe adjudication of custody.

EL, [2013] EWHC 49,\n\u00b659(e). If Mr. Chafin were able to secure a reversal of the District\nCourt\u2019s return order, the Scottish court adjudicating the custody\ndispute might similarly conclude that the child should not be re\u00ad\nreturned to Alabama, notwithstanding any U. S. court order to the\ncontrary, and that jurisdiction over her welfare should remain with the\nScottish court.\n  3 For the federal courts, the Advisory Committees on Federal Rules of\n\nCivil and Appellate Procedures might consider whether uniform rules\nfor expediting Convention proceedings are in order.

Argued December 5, 2012\u2014Decided February 19, 2013\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-\n  duction requires the judicial or administrative authority of a Con-\n  tracting State to order a child returned to her country of habitual res-\n  idence if the authority finds that the child has been wrongfully\n  removed to or retained in the Contracting State. The International\n  Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA) implements the Convention\n  in the United States, granting federal and state courts concurrent ju-\n  risdiction over Convention actions and directing those courts to de-\n  cide cases in accordance with the Convention. ICARA also requires\n  defendants to pay various expenses incurred by plaintiffs associated\n  with the return of children.\n     Petitioner Mr. Chafin, a United States citizen and member of the\n  military, married respondent Ms. Chafin, a United Kingdom citizen,\n  in Germany, where they later had a daughter, E. C. When Mr. Chaf-\n  in was deployed to Afghanistan, Ms. Chafin took E. C. to Scotland.\n  Mr. Chafin was later transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and Ms.\n  Chafin eventually traveled there with E. C. Soon after Ms. Chafin\u2019s\n  arrival, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and child custody in Alabama.\n  Ms. Chafin was subsequently deported, but E. C. remained in Ala-\n  bama with Mr. Chafin. Several months later, Ms. Chafin filed a peti-\n  tion under the Convention and ICARA, seeking E. C.\u2019s return to Scot-\n  land. The District Court concluded that E. C.\u2019s country of habitual\n  residence was Scotland and granted the petition for return. Ms.\n  Chafin immediately departed for Scotland with E. C. Ms. Chafin\n  then initiated custody proceedings in Scotland and was granted inter-\n  im custody and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mr. Chafin from\n  removing E. C. from Scotland. Mr. Chafin appealed the District\n  Court\u2019s order, but the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the appeal as moot,\n2                          CHAFIN v.CHAFIN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    on the ground that once a child has been returned to a foreign coun-\n    try, a U. S. court becomes powerless to grant relief. On remand, the\n    District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for court\n    costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and travel expenses.\nHeld: The return of a child to a foreign country pursuant to a Conven-\n tion return order does not render an appeal of that order moot.\n Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) Article III restricts the power of federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and\n \u201cControversies,\u201d and this \u201crequirement subsists through all stages of\n [the] proceedings,\u201d Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472,\n 477. No case or controversy exists, and a suit becomes moot, \u201cwhen\n the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally\n cognizable interest in the outcome,\u201d Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568\n U. S. ___, ___. But a case \u201cbecomes moot only when it is impossible\n for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing\n party,\u201d Knox v. Service Employees, 567 U. S. ___, ___. As \u201clong as the\n parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the\n litigation, the case is not moot,\u201d ibid. Pp. 5\u20136.\n    (b) Because the Chafins continue to vigorously contest the question\n of where their daughter will be raised, this dispute is very much\n alive. This case does not address \u201ca hypothetical state of facts,\u201d Lew-\n is, supra, at 477, and there continues to exist between the parties\n \u201cthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of is-\n sues,\u201d Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 6\u201311.\n      (1) Mr. Chafin seeks typical appellate relief: reversal of the Dis-\n trict Court determination that E. C.\u2019s habitual residence was Scot-\n land and, upon reversal, an order that E. C. be returned to the Unit-\n ed States. The question is whether such relief would be effectual. In\n arguing that this case is moot because the District Court has no au-\n thority to issue a re-return order either under the Convention or pur-\n suant to its inherent equitable powers, Ms. Chafin confuses mootness\n with the merits. See, e.g., Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 500.\n Mr. Chafin\u2019s claim for re-return cannot be dismissed as so implausi-\n ble that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction, and his prospects of\n success are therefore not pertinent to the mootness inquiry. As to the\n effectiveness of any relief, even if Scotland were to ignore a re-return\n order, this case would not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have\n personal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin and may command her to take\n action under threat of sanctions. She could decide to comply with an\n order against her and return E. C. to the United States. Enforcement\n of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but\n such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot. Pp. 7\u201310.\n      (2) Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the District\n Court\u2019s expense orders. That too is common relief on appeal, and the\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

In contending that\n  this case is moot due to Mr. Chafin\u2019s failure to pursue an appeal of\n  the expense orders, which were entered as separate judgments, Ms.\n  Chafin again confuses mootness with the merits. Because there is\n  authority for the proposition that failure to appeal such judgments\n  separately does not preclude relief, it is for lower courts at later stag-\n  es of the litigation to decide whether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to\n  the relief he seeks. That relief would not be \u201c \u2018fully satisfactory,\u2019 \u201d but\n  \u201ceven the availability of a \u2018partial remedy\u2019 is \u2018sufficient to prevent [a]\n  case from being moot,\u2019 \u201d Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150.\n  Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (c) Manipulating constitutional doctrine and holding these cases\n  moot is not necessary to achieve the ends of the Convention and IC-\n  ARA, and may undermine the treaty\u2019s goals and harm the children\n  meant to be protected. If these cases were to become moot upon re-\n  turn, courts would be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,\n  to prevent the loss of any right to appeal. Such routine stays would\n  conflict with the Convention\u2019s mandate of prompt return. Courts\n  should instead apply traditional factors in considering whether to\n  stay a return order, see, e.g., Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434, thus\n  ensuring that each case will receive the individualized treatment\n  necessary for appropriate consideration of the child\u2019s best interests.\n  Finally, at both the district and appellate court level, courts should\n  take steps to decide these cases as expeditiously as possible.

S. Army. While\nstationed in Germany in 2006, he married respondent\nLynne Hales Chafin, a citizen of the United Kingdom.\nTheir daughter E. C. was born the following year.\n  Later in 2007, Mr. Chafin was deployed to Afghanistan,\n4                   CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Ms. Chafin took E. C. to Scotland. Mr. Chafin was\neventually transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and in\nFebruary 2010, Ms. Chafin traveled to Alabama with E. C.\nSoon thereafter, however, Mr. Chafin filed for divorce and\nfor child custody in Alabama state court. Towards the end\nof the year, Ms. Chafin was arrested for domestic violence,\nan incident that alerted U. S. Citizenship and Immigra\u00ad\ntion Services to the fact that she had overstayed her visa.\nShe was deported in February 2011, and E. C. remained in\nMr. Chafin\u2019s care for several more months.\n   In May 2011, Ms. Chafin initiated this case in the U. S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Alabama. She\nfiled a petition under the Convention and ICARA seeking\nan order for E. C.\u2019s return to Scotland. On October 11 and\n12, 2011, the District Court held a bench trial. Upon the\nclose of arguments, the court ruled in favor of Ms. Chafin,\nconcluding that E. C.\u2019s country of habitual residence was\nScotland and granting the petition for return. Mr. Chafin\nimmediately moved for a stay pending appeal, but the\ncourt denied his request. Within hours, Ms. Chafin left\nthe country with E. C., headed for Scotland. By December\n2011, she had initiated custody proceedings there. The\nScottish court soon granted her interim custody and a\npreliminary injunction, prohibiting Mr. Chafin from re\u00ad\nmoving E. C. from Scotland. In the meantime, Mr. Chafin\nhad appealed the District Court order to the Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n   In February 2012, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed Mr.\nChafin\u2019s appeal as moot in a one-paragraph order, citing\nBekier v.

Meanwhile, the\nAlabama state court had dismissed the child custody\nproceeding initiated by Mr. Chafin for lack of jurisdiction.\nThe Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed, relying in\npart on the U.

Mr. Chafin seeks\ncustody of E. C., and wants to pursue that relief in the\nUnited States, while Ms. Chafin is pursuing that right for\nherself in Scotland. And Mr. Chafin wants the orders that\nhe pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 vacated, while Ms. Chafin\nasserts the money is rightfully owed.\n  On many levels, the Chafins continue to vigorously\ncontest the question of where their daughter will be\nraised.

C.\u2019s\nhabitual residence was Scotland and, if that determination\nis reversed, an order that E. C. be returned to the United\nStates (or \u201cre-return,\u201d as the parties have put it). In short,\nMr. Chafin is asking for typical appellate relief: that the\nCourt of Appeals reverse the District Court and that the\nDistrict Court undo what it has done. See Arkadelphia\nMilling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., 249 U. S.\n134, 145\u2013146 (1919); Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, 139\nU. S. 216, 219 (1891) (\u201cJurisdiction to correct what had\nbeen wrongfully done must remain with the court so long\nas the parties and the case are properly before it, either in\nthe first instance or when remanded to it by an appellate\ntribunal\u201d). The question is whether such relief would be\neffectual in this case.\n   Ms. Chafin argues that this case is moot because the\nDistrict Court lacks the authority to issue a re-return\norder either under the Convention or pursuant to its in-\nherent equitable powers. But that argument\u2014which\ngoes to the meaning of the Convention and the legal avail\u00ad\nability of a certain kind of relief\u2014confuses mootness with\nthe merits. In Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486 (1969),\nthis Court held that a claim for backpay saved the case\nfrom mootness, even though the defendants argued that\nthe backpay claim had been brought in the wrong court\nand therefore could not result in relief. As the Court\n8                        CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained, \u201cthis argument . . . confuses mootness with\nwhether [the plaintiff] has established a right to recover\n. . . , a question which it is inappropriate to treat at this\nstage of the litigation.\u201d Id., at 500. Mr. Chafin\u2019s claim\nfor re-return\u2014under the Convention itself or according to\ngeneral equitable principles\u2014cannot be dismissed as so\nimplausible that it is insufficient to preserve jurisdiction,\nsee Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.\n83, 89 (1998), and his prospects of success are therefore\nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\n    As to the effectiveness of any relief, Ms. Chafin asserts\nthat even if the habitual residence ruling were reversed\nand the District Court were to issue a re-return order, that\nrelief would be ineffectual because Scotland would simply\nignore it.1 But even if Scotland were to ignore a U. S. re\u00ad\nreturn order, or decline to assist in enforcing it, this case\nwould not be moot. The U. S. courts continue to have\npersonal jurisdiction over Ms. Chafin, may command her\nto take action even outside the United States, and may\nback up any such command with sanctions. See Steele v.\nBulova Watch Co., 344 U. S. 280, 289 (1952); cf. Leman v.\nKrentler-Arnold Hinge Last Co., 284 U. S. 448, 451\u2013452\n(1932). No law of physics prevents E. C.\u2019s return from\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Whether Scotland would do so is unclear; Ms. Chafin cited no au\u00ad\n\nthority for her assertion in her brief or at oral argument. In a recently\nissued decision from the Family Division of the High Court of Justice\nof England and Wales, a judge of that court rejected the \u201cconcept of\nautomatic re-return of a child in response to the overturn of [a] Hague\norder.\u201d DL v. EL, [2013] EWHC 49, \u00b659 (Judgt. of Jan. 17). The judge\nin that case did not ignore the pertinent re-return order\u2014issued by the\nDistrict Court in Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d 295 (CA5 2012), cert.\npending, No. 12\u2013304\u2014but did not consider it binding in light of the\nproceedings in England.\n  Earlier in those proceedings, the Family Division of the High Court\ndirected the parties to provide this Court with a joint statement on\nthe status of those proceedings. This Court is grateful for that\nconsideration.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nScotland, see Fawcett v. McRoberts, 326 F. 3d 491, 496\n(CA4 2003), abrogated on other grounds by Abbott v.\nAbbott, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), and Ms. Chafin might decide\nto comply with an order against her and return E. C. to\nthe United States, see, e.g., Larbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d\n295, 303\u2013304 (CA5 2012) (mother who had taken child\nto United Kingdom complied with Texas court sanctions\norder and order to return child to United States for trial),\ncert. pending, No. 12\u2013304.2 After all, the consequence of\ncompliance presumably would not be relinquishment of\ncustody rights, but simply custody proceedings in a differ\u00ad\nent forum.\n   Enforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Cha-\nfin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typi\u00ad\ncally render cases moot. Courts often adjudicate disputes\nwhere the practical impact of any decision is not assured.\nFor example, courts issue default judgments against de\u00ad\nfendants who failed to appear or participate in the pro\u00ad\nceedings and therefore seem less likely to comply. See\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 55. Similarly, the fact that a defend\u00ad\nant is insolvent does not moot a claim for damages. See\n13C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice\nand Procedure \u00a73533.3, p. 3 (3d ed. 2008) (cases not moot\n\u201ceven though the defendant does not seem able to pay any\nportion of the damages claimed\u201d). Courts also decide cases\nagainst foreign nations, whose choices to respect final\nrulings are not guaranteed. See, e.g., Republic of Austria\nv. Altmann, 541 U. S. 677 (2004) (suit against Austria for\nreturn of paintings); Republic of Argentina v. Weltover,\nInc., 504 U. S. 607 (1992) (suit against Argentina for\nrepayment of bonds). And we have heard the Govern\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Ms. Chafin suggests that the Scottish court\u2019s ne exeat order prohib\u00ad\nits E. C. from leaving Scotland. The ne exeat order, however, only\nprohibits Mr. Chafin from removing E. C. from Scotland; it does not\nconstrain Ms. Chafin in the same way.\n10                         CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nment\u2019s appeal from the reversal of a conviction, even\nthough the defendants had been deported, reducing the\npractical impact of any decision; we concluded that the\ncase was not moot because the defendants might \u201cre-enter\nthis country on their own\u201d and encounter the consequences\nof our ruling. United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462\nU. S. 579, 581, n. 2 (1983).\n  So too here. A re-return order may not result in the\nreturn of E. C. to the United States, just as an order that\nan insolvent defendant pay $100 million may not make\nthe plaintiff rich. But it cannot be said that the parties\nhere have no \u201cconcrete interest\u201d in whether Mr. Chafin\nsecures a re-return order. Knox, 567 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[H]owever\nsmall\u201d that concrete interest may be due to potential\ndifficulties in enforcement, it is not simply a matter of\nacademic debate, and is enough to save this case from\nmootness. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                             B\n  Mr. Chafin also seeks, if he prevails, vacatur of the\nDistrict Court\u2019s expense orders. The District Court or\u00ad\ndered Mr. Chafin to pay Ms. Chafin over $94,000 in court\ncosts, attorney\u2019s fees, and travel expenses. See Civ. No.\n11\u20131461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 15\u201316; Civ. No. 11\u2013\n1461 (ND Ala., June 5, 2012), p. 2. That award was predi\u00ad\ncated on the District Court\u2019s earlier judgment allowing\nMs. Chafin to return with her daughter to Scotland. See\nCiv. No. 11\u20131461 (ND Ala., Mar. 7, 2012), pp. 2\u20133, and\nn. 2.3 Thus, in conjunction with reversal of the judgment,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The award was predicated on the earlier judgment even though that\n\njudgment was vacated. The District Court cited Eleventh Circuit cases\nfor the proposition that if a plaintiff obtains relief before a district court\nand the case becomes moot on appeal, the plaintiff is still a prevailing\nparty entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. We express no view on that question.\nThe fact remains that the District Court ordered Mr. Chafin to pay\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nMr. Chafin desires vacatur of the award. That too is\ncommon relief on appeal, see, e.g., Fawcett, supra, at 501,\nn. 6 (reversing costs and fees award when reversing on the\nissue of wrongful removal), and the mootness inquiry\ncomes down to its effectiveness.\n   At oral argument, Ms. Chafin contended that such relief\nwas \u201cgone in this case,\u201d and that the case was therefore\nmoot, because Mr. Chafin had failed to pursue an appeal\nof the expense orders, which had been entered as separate\njudgments. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; see Civ. No. 11\u20131461 (ND\nAla., Mar. 7, 2012); Civ. No. 11\u20131461 (ND Ala., June 5,\n2012). But this is another argument on the merits. Mr.\nChafin\u2019s requested relief is not so implausible that it may\nbe disregarded on the question of jurisdiction; there is\nauthority for the proposition that failure to appeal such\njudgments separately does not preclude relief. See 15B\nWright, Miller, & Cooper, supra, \u00a73915.6, at 230, and\nn. 39.5 (2d ed., Supp. 2012) (citing cases). It is thus for\nlower courts at later stages of the litigation to decide\nwhether Mr. Chafin is in fact entitled to the relief he seeks\u2014\nvacatur of the expense orders.\n   Such relief would of course not be \u201c \u2018fully satisfactory,\u2019 \u201d\nbut with respect to the case as whole, \u201ceven the availabil\u00ad\nity of a \u2018partial remedy\u2019 is \u2018sufficient to prevent [a] case\nfrom being moot.\u2019 \u201d Calderon v. Moore, 518 U. S. 149, 150\n(1996) (per curiam) (quoting Church of Scientology, 506\nU. S., at 13).\n                            IV\n  Ms. Chafin is correct to emphasize that both the Hague\nConvention and ICARA stress the importance of the\nprompt return of children wrongfully removed or retained.\nWe are also sympathetic to the concern that shuttling\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nattorney\u2019s fees and travel expenses based on its earlier ruling. A\nreversal, as opposed to vacatur, of the earlier ruling could change the\nprevailing party calculus and afford Mr. Chafin effective relief.\n12                   CHAFIN v. CHAFIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchildren back and forth between parents and across inter\u00ad\nnational borders may be detrimental to those children.\nBut courts can achieve the ends of the Convention and\nICARA\u2014and protect the well-being of the affected chil\u00ad\ndren\u2014through the familiar judicial tools of expediting\nproceedings and granting stays where appropriate. There\nis no need to manipulate constitutional doctrine and hold\nthese cases moot. Indeed, doing so may very well under\u00ad\nmine the goals of the treaty and harm the children it is\nmeant to protect.\n   If these cases were to become moot upon return, courts\nwould be more likely to grant stays as a matter of course,\nto prevent the loss of any right to appeal. See, e.g., Garri-\nson v. Hudson, 468 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1984) (Burger, C. J.,\nin chambers) (\u201cWhen . . . the normal course of appellate\nreview might otherwise cause the case to become moot,\nissuance of a stay is warranted\u201d (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Nicolson v. Pappalardo, Civ.\nNo. 10\u20131125 (CA1, Feb. 19, 2010) (\u201cWithout necessarily\nfinding a clear probability that appellant will prevail, we\ngrant the stay because . . . a risk exists that the case could\neffectively be mooted by the child\u2019s departure\u201d). In cases\nin which a stay would not be granted but for the prospect\nof mootness, a child would lose precious months when she\ncould have been readjusting to life in her country of habit\u00ad\nual residence, even though the appeal had little chance of\nsuccess. Such routine stays due to mootness would be\nlikely but would conflict with the Convention\u2019s mandate of\nprompt return to a child\u2019s country of habitual residence.\n   Routine stays could also increase the number of appeals.\nCurrently, only about 15% of Hague Convention cases are\nappealed.

A mootness holding here might\nalso encourage flight in future Hague Convention cases, as\nprevailing parents try to flee the jurisdiction to moot the\ncase. See Bekier, 248 F. 3d, at 1055 (mootness holding \u201cto\nsome degree conflicts with the purposes of the Convention:\nto prevent parents from fleeing jurisdictions to find a more\nfavorable judicial forum\u201d).\n   Courts should apply the four traditional stay factors in\nconsidering whether to stay a return order: \u201c \u2018(1) whether\nthe stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is\nlikely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant\nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether\nissuance of the stay will substantially injure the other\nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the\npublic interest lies.\u2019 \u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434\n(2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U. S. 770, 776\n(1987)). In every case under the Hague Convention, the\nwell-being of a child is at stake; application of the tradi\u00ad\ntional stay factors ensures that each case will receive the\nindividualized treatment necessary for appropriate con\u00ad\nsideration of the child\u2019s best interests.\n   Importantly, whether at the district or appellate court\nlevel, courts can and should take steps to decide these\ncases as expeditiously as possible, for the sake of the\nchildren who find themselves in such an unfortunate\nsituation. Many courts already do so. See Federal Judi\u00ad\ncial Center, J. Garbolino, The 1980 Hague Convention on\nthe Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction: A\nGuide for Judges 116, n. 435 (2012) (listing courts that\nexpedite appeals).

The case before us illus\u00ad\ntrates the protraction likely to ensue when the finality\nof a return order is left in limbo.\n   Upon determining that the daughter of Jeffrey Chafin\nand Lynne Chafin resided in Scotland, the District Court\ndenied Mr. Chafin\u2019s request for a stay pending appeal, and\nauthorized the child\u2019s immediate departure for Scotland.\nThe Eleventh Circuit, viewing the matter as a fait accom-\npli, dismissed the appeal filed by Mr. Chafin as moot.1 As\nthe Court\u2019s opinion explains, the Eleventh Circuit erred in\nholding that the child\u2019s removal to Scotland rendered\nfurther adjudication in the U. S. meaningless. Reversal of\nthe District Court\u2019s return order, I agree, could provide\nMr. Chafin with meaningful relief. A determination that\nthe child\u2019s habitual residence was Alabama, not Scotland,\nwould open the way for an order directing Ms. Chafin to\n\u201cre-return\u201d the child to the United States and for Mr.\nChafin to seek a custody adjudication in an Alabama state\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 The\n        Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to vacate the\nreturn order, thus leaving the child\u2019s habitual residence undetermined.\nThe Convention envisions an adjudication of habitual residence by the\nreturn forum so that the forum abroad may proceed, immediately, to\nthe adjudication of custody. See Convention, Arts. 1, 16, 19, Treaty\nDoc., at 7, 10, 11. See also DL v.

And the advent of\nrival custody proceedings in Scotland and Alabama is just\nwhat the Convention aimed to stave off.\n   This case highlights the need for both speed and cer\u00ad\ntainty in Convention decisionmaking. Most Contracting\nStates permit challenges to first instance return orders.\nSee Guide to Good Practice, Part IV\u2013Enforcement, \u00a72.3,\n\u00b657, at 14. How might appellate review proceed con\u00ad\nsistent with the Convention\u2019s emphasis on expedition?\nAccording to a Federal Judicial Center guide, \u201c[e]xpedited\nprocedures for briefing and handling of [return-order]\nappeals have become common in most circuits.\u201d J. Gar\u00ad\nbolino, The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of\nInternational Child Abduction: A Guide for Judges 116\n(2012).3 As an example, the guide describes Charalam-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 As the Court observes, ante, at 8, n. 1, a judge of the Family Divi\u00ad\n\nsion of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales recently con\u00ad\ncluded that \u201cthe concept of automatic re-return of a child in response to\nthe overturn of [a] Hague order pursuant to which [the child] came [to\nEngland] is unsupported by law or principle, and would . . . be deeply\ninimical to [the child\u2019s] best interests.\u201d DL v. EL, [2013] EWHC 49,\n\u00b659(e). If Mr. Chafin were able to secure a reversal of the District\nCourt\u2019s return order, the Scottish court adjudicating the custody\ndispute might similarly conclude that the child should not be re\u00ad\nreturned to Alabama, notwithstanding any U. S. court order to the\ncontrary, and that jurisdiction over her welfare should remain with the\nScottish court.\n  3 For the federal courts, the Advisory Committees on Federal Rules of\n\nCivil and Appellate Procedures might consider whether uniform rules\nfor expediting Convention proceedings are in order. Cf. ante, at 14\n(noting that \u201c[c]ases in American courts often take over two years from\n4                        CHAFIN v.CHAFIN\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., concurring\n\nbous v. Charalambous, 627 F. 3d 462 (CA1 2010)\n(per curiam), in which the Court of Appeals stayed a re\u00ad\nturn order, expedited the appeal, and issued a final judg\u00ad\nment affirming the return order 57 days after its entry.\nOnce appellate review established the finality of the re\u00ad\nturn order, custody could be litigated in the child\u2019s place\nof habitual residence with no risk of a rival proceeding\nelsewhere.\n   But as the Court indicates, stays, even of short duration,\nshould not be granted \u201cas a matter of course,\u201d for they\ninevitably entail loss of \u201cprecious months when [the child]\ncould have been readjusting to life in her country of habit\u00ad\nual residence.\u201d Ante, at 12; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. See\nalso DL v. EL, [2013] EWHC 49 (Family Div.), \u00b638 (Judgt.\nof Jan. 17) (\u201c[Children] find themselves in a sort of Hague\ntriangle limbo, marooned in a jurisdiction from which\ntheir return has been ordered but becalmed by extended\nuncertainty whether they will in the event go or stay.\u201d).\nWhere no stay is ordered, the risk of a two-front battle\nover custody will remain real. See supra, at 2\u20133. See also\nLarbie v. Larbie, 690 F. 3d 295 (CA5 2012) (vacating re\u00ad\nturn order following appeal in which no stay was sought).4\n   Amicus Centre for Family Law and Policy calls our\nattention to the management of Convention hearings and\nappeals in England and Wales and suggests that proce\u00ad\ndures there may be instructive.

To pursue\nan appeal from a return order in those domains, leave\nmust be obtained from the first instance judge or the\nCourt of Appeal. Family Procedure Rules 2010, Rule 30.3\n(U. K.).

Although an appeal does not trigger an automatic\nstay, see Rule 30.8, if leave to appeal is granted, we are\ninformed, a stay is ordinarily ordered by the court that\ngranted leave.

And by providing for stays when an appeal is well\nfounded, the system reduces the risk of rival custody\nproceedings. Congressional action would be necessary if\nreturn-order appeals are not to be available in U. S. courts\nas a matter of right, but legislation requiring leave to\nappeal would not be entirely novel.
