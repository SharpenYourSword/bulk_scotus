UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–770.      Argued November 1, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013\nWhile police were preparing to execute a warrant to search a basement\n apartment for a handgun, detectives conducting surveillance in an\n unmarked car outside the apartment saw two men―later identified\n as petitioner Chunon Bailey and Bryant Middleton―leave the gated\n area above the apartment, get in a car, and drive away. The detec-\n tives waited for the men to leave and then followed the car approxi-\n mately a mile before stopping it. They found keys during a patdown\n search of Bailey, who initially said that he resided in the apartment\n but later denied it when informed of the search. Both men were\n handcuffed and driven in a patrol car to the apartment, where the\n search team had already found a gun and illicit drugs. After arrest-\n ing the men, police discovered that one of Bailey’s keys unlocked the\n apartment’s door.\n    At trial, the District Court denied Bailey’s motion to suppress the\n apartment key and the statements he made to the detectives when\n stopped, holding that Bailey’s detention was justified under Michigan\n v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, as a detention incident to the execution of\n a search warrant, and, in the alternative, that the detention was\n supported by reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1.\n Bailey was convicted. The Second Circuit affirmed denial of the sup-\n pression motion. Finding that Summers authorized Bailey’s deten-\n tion, it did not address the alternative Terry holding.\nHeld: The rule in Summers is limited to the immediate vicinity of the\n premises to be searched and does not apply here, where Bailey was\n detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the im-\n mediate vicinity of the premises in question. Pp. 4−15.\n    (a) The Summers rule permits officers executing a search warrant\n “to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is con-\n2                       BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ducted,” 452 U. S., at 705, even when there is no particular suspicion\n    that an individual is involved in criminal activity or poses a specific\n    danger to the officers, Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93. Detention is\n    permitted “because the character of the additional intrusion caused\n    by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are\n    substantial.” Id., at 98. In Summers and later cases the detained oc-\n    cupants were found within or immediately outside the residence be-\n    ing searched. Here, however, petitioner left the apartment before the\n    search began and was detained nearly a mile away. Pp. 4−6.\n       (b) In Summers, the Court recognized three important law en-\n    forcement interests that, taken together, justify detaining an occu-\n    pant who is on the premises during the search warrant’s execution,\n    452 U. S., at 702−703. The first, officer safety, requires officers to se-\n    cure the premises, which may include detaining current occupants so\n    the officers can search without fear that the occupants will become\n    disruptive, dangerous, or otherwise frustrate the search. If an occu-\n    pant returns home during the search, officers can mitigate the risk by\n    taking routine precautions. Here, however, Bailey posed little risk to\n    the officers at the scene after he left the premises, apparently with-\n    out knowledge of the search. Had he returned, he could have been\n    apprehended and detained under Summers. Were police to have the\n    authority to detain persons away from the premises, the authority to\n    detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach be-\n    yond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detain-\n    ing those who are on the scene. As for the Second Circuit’s additional\n    concerns, if officers believe that it would be dangerous to detain a de-\n    parting individual in front of a residence, they are not required to\n    stop him; and if officers have reasonable suspicion of criminal activi-\n    ty, they can instead rely on Terry. The risk that a departing occu-\n    pant might alert those still inside the residence is also an insufficient\n    safety rationale for expanding the detention authority beyond the\n    immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.\n       The second law enforcement interest is the facilitation of the com-\n    pletion of the search. Unrestrained occupants can hide or destroy ev-\n    idence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the way. But a\n    general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search cannot justify de-\n    tention beyond the vicinity of the premises. Occupants who are kept\n    from leaving may assist the officers by opening locked doors or con-\n    tainers in order to avoid the use of force that can damage property or\n    delay completion of the search. But this justification must be con-\n    fined to persons on site as the search warrant is executed and so in a\n    position to observe the progression of the search.\n       The third interest is the interest in preventing flight, which also\n    serves to preserve the integrity of the search. If officers are con-\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cerned about flight in the event incriminating evidence is found, they\n  might rush the search, causing unnecessary damage or compromising\n  its careful execution. The need to prevent flight, however, if un-\n  bounded, might be used to argue for detention of any regular occu-\n  pant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search, e.g.,\n  detaining a suspect 10 miles away, ready to board a plane. Even if\n  the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could fa-\n  cilitate a later arrest if incriminating evidence is discovered, “the\n  mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never\n  by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment.” Mincey v. Ari-\n  zona, 437 U. S. 385, 393.\n     In sum, none of the three law enforcement interests identified in\n  Summers applies with the same or similar force to the detention of\n  recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\n  searched. And each is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an ex-\n  pansion of the rule in Summers to permit the detention of a former\n  occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the\n  search. Pp. 6–12.\n     (c) As recognized in Summers, the detention of a current occupant\n  “represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when\n  the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant,” 452\n  U. S., at 703, but an arrest of an individual away from his home in-\n  volves an additional level of intrusiveness. A public detention, even\n  if merely incident to a search, will resemble a full-fledged arrest and\n  can involve the indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premis-\n  es. P. 12.\n     (d) Limiting the rule in Summers to the area within which an occu-\n  pant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search\n  warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search\n  is confined to its underlying justification. Because petitioner was de-\n  tained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of immediate\n  vicinity, there is no need to further define that term here. Since de-\n  tention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient\n  search, the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the\n  search and not at a later time in a more remote place.

A search may\nbe of a person, a thing, or a place. So too a seizure may be\nof a person, a thing, or even a place. A search or a seizure\nmay occur singly or in combination, and in differing se-\nquence. In some cases the validity of one determines the\nvalidity of the other. The instant case involves the search\nof a place (an apartment dwelling) and the seizure of a\nperson. But here, though it is acknowledged that the\nsearch was lawful, it does not follow that the seizure was\nlawful as well. The seizure of the person is quite in ques-\ntion. The issue to be resolved is whether the seizure of the\nperson was reasonable when he was stopped and detained\nat some distance away from the premises to be searched\nwhen the only justification for the detention was to ensure\nthe safety and efficacy of the search.\n                            I\n                           A\n At 8:45 p.m. on July 28, 2005, local police obtained a\nwarrant to search a residence for a .380-caliber handgun.\n2                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe residence was a basement apartment at 103 Lake\nDrive, in Wyandanch, New York. A confidential informant\nhad told police he observed the gun when he was at the\napartment to purchase drugs from “a heavy set black male\nwith short hair” known as “Polo.” App. 16–26. As the\nsearch unit began preparations for executing the warrant,\ntwo officers, Detectives Richard Sneider and Richard\nGorbecki, were conducting surveillance in an unmarked\ncar outside the residence. About 9:56 p.m., Sneider and\nGorbecki observed two men—later identified as petitioner\nChunon Bailey and Bryant Middleton—leave the gated\narea above the basement apartment and enter a car\nparked in the driveway. Both matched the general physi-\ncal description of “Polo” provided by the informant. There\nwas no indication that the men were aware of the officers’\npresence or had any knowledge of the impending search.\nThe detectives watched the car leave the driveway. They\nwaited for it to go a few hundred yards down the street\nand followed. The detectives informed the search team of\ntheir intent to follow and detain the departing occupants.\nThe search team then executed the search warrant at the\napartment.\n  Detectives Sneider and Gorbecki tailed Bailey’s car for\nabout a mile—and for about five minutes—before pulling\nthe vehicle over in a parking lot by a fire station. They\nordered Bailey and Middleton out of the car and did a\npatdown search of both men. The officers found no weap-\nons but discovered a ring of keys in Bailey’s pocket. Bailey\nidentified himself and said he was coming from his home\nat 103 Lake Drive. His driver’s license, however, showed\nhis address as Bayshore, New York, the town where the\nconfidential informant told the police the suspect, “Polo,”\nused to live. Id., at 89. Bailey’s passenger, Middleton,\nsaid Bailey was giving him a ride home and confirmed\nthey were coming from Bailey’s residence at 103 Lake\nDrive. The officers put both men in handcuffs. When\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBailey asked why, Gorbecki stated that they were being\ndetained incident to the execution of a search warrant\nat 103 Lake Drive. Bailey responded: “I don’t live there.\nAnything you find there ain’t mine, and I’m not cooperat-\ning with your investigation.” Id., at 57, 77.\n  The detectives called for a patrol car to take Bailey and\nMiddleton back to the Lake Drive apartment. Detective\nSneider drove the unmarked car back, while Detective\nGorbecki used Bailey’s set of keys to drive Bailey’s car\nback to the search scene. By the time the group returned\nto 103 Lake Drive, the search team had discovered a gun\nand drugs in plain view inside the apartment. Bailey and\nMiddleton were placed under arrest, and Bailey’s keys\nwere seized incident to the arrest. Officers later discov-\nered that one of Bailey’s keys opened the door of the\nbasement apartment.\n                             B\n  Bailey was charged with three federal offenses: posses-\nsion of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21\nU. S. C. §§841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii); possession of a fire-\narm by a felon, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1); and\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\noffense, in violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i). At trial Bailey\nmoved to suppress the apartment key and the statements\nhe made when stopped by Detectives Sneider and Gor-\nbecki. That evidence, Bailey argued, derived from an\nunreasonable seizure. After an evidentiary hearing the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York denied the motion to suppress. The District\nCourt held that Bailey’s detention was permissible under\nMichigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), as a detention\nincident to the execution of a search warrant. In the\nalternative, it held that Bailey’s detention was lawful as\nan investigatory detention supported by reasonable suspi-\ncion under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). After a trial\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe jury found Bailey guilty on all three counts.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that\nBailey’s detention was proper and affirmed denial of the\nsuppression motion. It interpreted this Court’s decision\nin Summers to “authoriz[e] law enforcement to detain the\noccupant of premises subject to a valid search warrant\nwhen that person is seen leaving those premises and the\ndetention is effected as soon as reasonably practicable.”\n652 F. 3d 197, 208 (2011). Having found Bailey’s deten-\ntion justified under Summers, the Court of Appeals did not\naddress the District Court’s alternative holding that the\nstop was permitted under Terry.\n   The Federal Courts of Appeals have reached differing\nconclusions as to whether Michigan v. Summers justifies\nthe detention of occupants beyond the immediate vicinity\nof the premises covered by a search warrant. This Court\ngranted certiorari to address the question. 566 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment, applicable through the Four-\nteenth Amendment to the States, provides: “The right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons . . . against unrea-\nsonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . .\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the\npersons or things to be seized.” This Court has stated “the\ngeneral rule that Fourth Amendment seizures are ‘rea-\nsonable’ only if based on probable cause” to believe that\nthe individual has committed a crime. Dunaway v. New\nYork, 442 U. S. 200, 213 (1979). The standard of probable\ncause, with “roots that are deep in our history,” Henry v.\nUnited States, 361 U. S. 98, 100 (1959), “represent[s] the\naccumulated wisdom of precedent and experience as to\nthe minimum justification necessary to make the kind\nof intrusion involved in an arrest ‘reasonable’ under the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFourth Amendment.” Dunaway, supra, at 208.\n   Within the framework of these fundamental rules there\nis some latitude for police to detain where “the intrusion\non the citizen’s privacy ‘was so much less severe’ than that\ninvolved in a traditional arrest that ‘the opposing interests\nin crime prevention and detection and in the police of-\nficer’s safety’ could support the seizure as reasonable.”\nSummers, supra, at 697–698 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at\n209); see also Terry, supra, at 27 (holding that a police\nofficer who has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity\nmay conduct a brief investigative stop).\n   In Summers, the Court defined an important category of\ncases in which detention is allowed without probable cause\nto arrest for a crime. It permitted officers executing a\nsearch warrant “to detain the occupants of the premises\nwhile a proper search is conducted.” 452 U. S., at 705.\nThe rule in Summers extends farther than some earlier\nexceptions because it does not require law enforcement to\nhave particular suspicion that an individual is involved in\ncriminal activity or poses a specific danger to the officers.\nMuehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93 (2005). In Muehler, apply-\ning the rule in Summers, the Court stated: “An officer’s\nauthority to detain incident to a search is categorical; it\ndoes not depend on the ‘quantum of proof justifying deten-\ntion or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the\nseizure.’ ” 544 U. S., at 98 (quoting Summers, supra, at\n705, n. 19). The rule announced in Summers allows deten-\ntion incident to the execution of a search warrant “because\nthe character of the additional intrusion caused by deten-\ntion is slight and because the justifications for detention\nare substantial.” Muehler, supra, at 98.\n   In Summers and later cases the occupants detained\nwere found within or immediately outside a residence at\nthe moment the police officers executed the search war-\nrant. In Summers, the defendant was detained on a walk\nleading down from the front steps of the house. See Tr. of\n6                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOral Arg. in O. T. 1980, No. 79–1794, pp. 41–42; see also\nMuehler, supra, at 96 (detention of occupant in adjoining\ngarage); Los Angeles County v. Rettele, 550 U. S. 609, 611\n(2007) (per curiam) (detention of occupants in bedroom).\nHere, however, petitioner left the apartment before the\nsearch began; and the police officers waited to detain him\nuntil he was almost a mile away. The issue is whether the\nreasoning in Summers can justify detentions beyond the\nimmediate vicinity of the premises being searched. An\nexception to the Fourth Amendment rule prohibiting\ndetention absent probable cause must not diverge from its\npurpose and rationale. See Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S.\n491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion) (“The scope of the de-\ntention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justifi-\ncation”). It is necessary, then, to discuss the reasons for\nthe rule explained in Summers to determine if its ra-\ntionale extends to a detention like the one here.\n                            A\n  In Summers, the Court recognized three important law\nenforcement interests that, taken together, justify the\ndetention of an occupant who is on the premises during\nthe execution of a search warrant: officer safety, facilitat-\ning the completion of the search, and preventing flight.\n452 U. S., at 702–703.\n                               1\n   The first interest identified in Summers was “the inter-\nest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.” Id., at\n702. There the Court held that “the execution of a war-\nrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that\nmay give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to con-\nceal or destroy evidence,” and “[t]he risk of harm to both\nthe police and the occupants is minimized if the officers\nroutinely exercise unquestioned command of the situa-\ntion.” Id., at 702–703.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   When law enforcement officers execute a search war-\nrant, safety considerations require that they secure the\npremises, which may include detaining current occupants.\nBy taking “unquestioned command of the situation,” id., at\n703, the officers can search without fear that occupants,\nwho are on the premises and able to observe the course of\nthe search, will become disruptive, dangerous, or other-\nwise frustrate the search.\n   After Summers, this Court decided Muehler v. Mena.\nThe reasoning and conclusions in Muehler in applying the\nSummers rule go quite far in allowing seizure and deten-\ntion of persons to accommodate the necessities of a search.\nThere, the person detained and held in handcuffs was not\nsuspected of the criminal activity being investigated; but,\nthe Court held, she could be detained nonetheless, to\nsecure the premises while the search was underway. The\n“safety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for\nweapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs,\n[and] the need to detain multiple occupants made the use\nof handcuffs all the more reasonable.” 544 U. S., at 100.\nWhile the Court in Muehler did remand for consideration\nof whether the detention there—alleged to have been two\nor three hours—was necessary in light of all the circum-\nstances, the fact that so prolonged a detention indeed\nmight have been permitted illustrates the far-reaching\nauthority the police have when the detention is made at\nthe scene of the search. This in turn counsels caution\nbefore extending the power to detain persons stopped or\napprehended away from the premises where the search is\nbeing conducted.\n   It is likely, indeed almost inevitable in the case of a\nresident, that an occupant will return to the premises at\nsome point; and this might occur when the officers are still\nconducting the search. Officers can and do mitigate that\nrisk, however, by taking routine precautions, for instance\nby erecting barricades or posting someone on the perime-\n8                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter or at the door. In the instant case Bailey had left the\npremises, apparently without knowledge of the search. He\nposed little risk to the officers at the scene. If Bailey had\nrushed back to his apartment, the police could have ap-\nprehended and detained him under Summers. There is no\nestablished principle, however, that allows the arrest of\nanyone away from the premises who is likely to return.\n  The risk, furthermore, that someone could return home\nduring the execution of a search warrant is not limited to\noccupants who depart shortly before the start of a search.\nThe risk that a resident might return home, either for\nreasons unrelated to the search or after being alerted by\nsomeone at the scene, exists whether he left five minutes\nor five hours earlier. Unexpected arrivals by occupants or\nother persons accustomed to visiting the premises might\noccur in many instances. Were police to have the authority\nto detain those persons away from the premises, the\nauthority to detain incident to the execution of a search\nwarrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the\nintegrity of the search by detaining those who are in fact\non the scene.\n  The Court of Appeals relied on an additional safety\nconsideration. It concluded that limiting the application of\nthe authority to detain to the immediate vicinity would\nput law enforcement officers in a dilemma. They would\nhave to choose between detaining an individual immedi-\nately (and risk alerting occupants still inside) or allowing\nthe individual to leave (and risk not being able to arrest\nhim later if incriminating evidence were discovered). 652\nF. 3d, at 205–206. Although the danger of alerting occu-\npants who remain inside may be of real concern in some\ninstances, as in the case when a no-knock warrant has\nbeen issued, this safety rationale rests on the false prem-\nise that a detention must take place. If the officers find\nthat it would be dangerous to detain a departing individ-\nual in front of a residence, they are not required to stop\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhim. And, where there are grounds to believe the depart-\ning occupant is dangerous, or involved in criminal activity,\npolice will generally not need Summers to detain him at\nleast for brief questioning, as they can rely instead on\nTerry.\n   The risk that a departing occupant might notice the\npolice surveillance and alert others still inside the resi-\ndence is also an insufficient safety rationale to justify ex-\npanding the existing categorical authority to detain so\nthat it extends beyond the immediate vicinity of the prem-\nises to be searched. If extended in this way the rationale\nwould justify detaining anyone in the neighborhood who\ncould alert occupants that the police are outside, all with-\nout individualized suspicion of criminal activity or connec-\ntion to the residence to be searched. This possibility\ndemonstrates why it is necessary to confine the Summers\nrule to those who are present when and where the search\nis being conducted.\n                               2\n   The second law enforcement interest relied on in Sum-\nmers was that “the orderly completion of the search may\nbe facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.”\n452 U. S., at 703. This interest in efficiency derives from\ndistinct, but related, concerns.\n   If occupants are permitted to wander around the prem-\nises, there is the potential for interference with the execu-\ntion of the search warrant. They can hide or destroy\nevidence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the\nway. Those risks are not presented by an occupant who\ndeparts beforehand. So, in this case, after Bailey drove\naway from the Lake Drive apartment, he was not a threat\nto the proper execution of the search. Had he returned,\nofficers would have been free to detain him at that point.\nA general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search,\nhowever, cannot justify detention beyond the vicinity of\n10               BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe premises to be searched.\n   Summers also noted that occupants can assist the offi-\ncers. Under the reasoning in Summers, the occupants’\n“self-interest may induce them to open locked doors or\nlocked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only\ndamaging to property but may also delay the completion of\nthe task at hand.” Ibid. This justification must be con-\nfined to those persons who are on site and so in a position,\nwhen detained, to at once observe the progression of the\nsearch; and it would have no limiting principle were it to\nbe applied to persons beyond the premises of the search.\nHere, it appears the police officers decided to wait until\nBailey had left the vicinity of the search before detaining\nhim. In any event it later became clear to the officers that\nBailey did not wish to cooperate. See App. 57, 77 (“I don’t\nlive there. Anything you find there ain’t mine, and I’m not\ncooperating with your investigation”). And, by the time\nthe officers brought Bailey back to the apartment, the\nsearch team had discovered contraband. Bailey’s deten-\ntion thus served no purpose in ensuring the efficient com-\npletion of the search.\n                               3\n   The third law enforcement interest addressed in Sum-\nmers was the “the legitimate law enforcement interest in\npreventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence\nis found.” 452 U. S., at 702. The proper interpretation of\nthis language, in the context of Summers and in the\nbroader context of the reasonableness standard that must\ngovern and inform the detention incident to a search, is\nthat the police can prohibit an occupant from leaving the\nscene of the search. As with the other interests identified\nin Summers, this justification serves to preserve the integ-\nrity of the search by controlling those persons who are on\nthe scene. If police officers are concerned about flight, and\nhave to keep close supervision of occupants who are not\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrestrained, they might rush the search, causing unneces-\nsary damage to property or compromising its careful exe-\ncution. Allowing officers to secure the scene by detaining\nthose present also prevents the search from being impeded\nby occupants leaving with the evidence being sought or the\nmeans to find it.\n   The concern over flight is not because of the danger of\nflight itself but because of the damage that potential flight\ncan cause to the integrity of the search. This interest does\nnot independently justify detention of an occupant be-\nyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.\nThe need to prevent flight, if unbounded, might be used to\nargue for detention, while a search is underway, of any\nregular occupant regardless of his or her location at the\ntime of the search. If not circumscribed, the rationale of\npreventing flight would justify, for instance, detaining a\nsuspect who is 10 miles away, ready to board a plane. The\ninterest in preventing escape from police cannot extend\nthis far without undermining the usual rules for arrest\nbased on probable cause or a brief stop for questioning\nunder standards derived from Terry. Even if the detention\nof a former occupant away from the premises could facili-\ntate a later arrest should incriminating evidence be dis-\ncovered, “the mere fact that law enforcement may be made\nmore efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the\nFourth Amendment.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385,\n393 (1978).\n   In sum, of the three law enforcement interests identified\nto justify the detention in Summers, none applies with the\nsame or similar force to the detention of recent occupants\nbeyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\nsearched. Any of the individual interests is also insuffi-\ncient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in\nSummers to permit the detention of a former occupant,\nwherever he may be found away from the scene of the\nsearch. This would give officers too much discretion. The\n12               BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncategorical authority to detain incident to the execution of\na search warrant must be limited to the immediate vicini-\nty of the premises to be searched.\n                              B\n   In Summers, the Court recognized the authority to\ndetain occupants incident to the execution of a search\nwarrant not only in light of the law enforcement interests\nat stake but also because the intrusion on personal liberty\nwas limited. The Court held detention of a current occu-\npant “represents only an incremental intrusion on personal\nliberty when the search of a home has been authorized\nby a valid warrant.” 452 U. S., at 703. Because the deten-\ntion occurs in the individual’s own home, “it could add only\nminimally to the public stigma associated with the search\nitself and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the\nindignity associated with a compelled visit to the police\nstation.” Id., at 702.\n   Where officers arrest an individual away from his home,\nhowever, there is an additional level of intrusiveness. A\npublic detention, even if merely incident to a search, will\nresemble a full-fledged arrest. As demonstrated here,\ndetention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an\ninitial detention away from the scene and a second deten-\ntion at the residence. In between, the individual will\nsuffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back\nto the premises, giving all the appearances of an arrest.\nThe detention here was more intrusive than a usual de-\ntention at the search scene. Bailey’s car was stopped; he\nwas ordered to step out and was detained in full public\nview; he was handcuffed, transported in a marked patrol\ncar, and detained further outside the apartment. These\nfacts illustrate that detention away from a premises where\npolice are already present often will be more intrusive\nthan detentions at the scene.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n   Summers recognized that a rule permitting the deten-\ntion of occupants on the premises during the execution of a\nsearch warrant, even absent individualized suspicion, was\nreasonable and necessary in light of the law enforcement\ninterests in conducting a safe and efficient search. Be-\ncause this exception grants substantial authority to police\nofficers to detain outside of the traditional rules of the\nFourth Amendment, it must be circumscribed.\n   A spatial constraint defined by the immediate vicinity of\nthe premises to be searched is therefore required for de-\ntentions incident to the execution of a search warrant.\nThe police action permitted here—the search of a resi-\ndence—has a spatial dimension, and so a spatial or geo-\ngraphical boundary can be used to determine the area\nwithin which both the search and detention incident to\nthat search may occur. Limiting the rule in Summers to\nthe area in which an occupant poses a real threat to the\nsafe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures\nthat the scope of the detention incident to a search is\nconfined to its underlying justification. Once an occupant\nis beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\nsearched, the search-related law enforcement interests are\ndiminished and the intrusiveness of the detention is more\nsevere.\n   Here, petitioner was detained at a point beyond any\nreasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the\npremises in question; and so this case presents neither the\nnecessity nor the occasion to further define the meaning of\nimmediate vicinity. In closer cases courts can consider a\nnumber of factors to determine whether an occupant was\ndetained within the immediate vicinity of the premises to\nbe searched, including the lawful limits of the premises,\nwhether the occupant was within the line of sight of his\ndwelling, the ease of reentry from the occupant’s location,\nand other relevant factors.\n14                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Confining an officer’s authority to detain under Sum-\nmers to the immediate vicinity of a premises to be\nsearched is a proper limit because it accords with the\nrationale of the rule. The rule adopted by the Court of\nAppeals here, allowing detentions of a departed occupant\n“as soon as reasonably practicable,” departs from the\nspatial limit that is necessary to confine the rule in light of\nthe substantial intrusions on the liberty of those detained.\n  Because detention is justified by the interests in execut-\ning a safe and efficient search, the decision to detain must\nbe acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later\ntime in a more remote place. If officers elect to defer the\ndetention until the suspect or departing occupant leaves\nthe immediate vicinity, the lawfulness of detention is\ncontrolled by other standards, including, of course, a brief\nstop for questioning based on reasonable suspicion under\nTerry or an arrest based on probable cause. A suspect’s\nparticular actions in leaving the scene, including whether\nhe appears to be armed or fleeing with the evidence\nsought, and any information the officers acquire from\nthose who are conducting the search, including infor-\nmation that incriminating evidence has been discovered,\nwill bear, of course, on the lawfulness of a later stop or\ndetention. For example, had the search team radioed\nDetectives Sneider and Gorbecki about the gun and drugs\ndiscovered in the Lake Drive apartment as the officers\nstopped Bailey and Middleton, this may have provided\nthem with probable cause for an arrest.\n                            III\n  Detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant\nare reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because the\nlimited intrusion on personal liberty is outweighed by the\nspecial law enforcement interests at stake. Once an indi-\nvidual has left the immediate vicinity of a premises to be\nsearched, however, detentions must be justified by some\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

In this respect it must be noted that the\nDistrict Court, as an alternative ruling, held that stopping\npetitioner was lawful under Terry. This opinion expresses\nno view on that issue. It will be open, on remand, for the\nCourt of Appeals to address the matter and to determine\nwhether, assuming the Terry stop was valid, it yielded\ninformation that justified the detention the officers then\nimposed.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

I write separately to em-\nphasize why the Court of Appeals’ interest-balancing\napproach to this case—endorsed by the dissent—is incom-\npatible with the categorical rule set forth in Michigan\nv. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981).\n   Summers identified several law-enforcement interests\nsupporting the detention of occupants incident to the\nexecution of a warrant to search for contraband, along\nwith several reasons why such detentions are typically\nless intrusive than an arrest. See id., at 701–704. Weigh-\ning those factors, the Court determined that “it is constitu-\ntionally reasonable to require [a] citizen to remain while\nofficers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his\nhome.” Id., at 705.\n   The existence and scope of the Summers exception were\npredicated on that balancing of the interests and burdens.\nBut—crucially—whether Summers authorizes a seizure in\nan individual case does not depend on any balancing,\nbecause the Summers exception, within its scope, is “cate-\ngorical.” Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 98 (2005). That\nSummers establishes a categorical, bright-line rule is\nsimply not open to debate—Summers itself insisted on it:\n“The rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an\n2                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nad hoc determination, because the officer is not required to\nevaluate either the quantum of proof justifying detention\nor the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the sei-\nzure.” 452 U. S., at 705, n. 19. Where Summers applies, a\nseizure is ipso facto “constitutionally reasonable.” Id., at\n705.\n  The question in this case is whether Summers applies\nat all. It applies only to seizures of “occupants”—that is,\npersons within “the immediate vicinity of the premises to\nbe searched.” Ante, at 11. Bailey was seized a mile\naway. Ergo, Summers cannot sanction Bailey’s detention. It\nreally is that simple.\n  The Court of Appeals’ mistake, echoed by the dissent,\nwas to replace that straightforward, binary inquiry with\nopen-ended balancing. Weighing the equities—Bailey\n“posed a risk of harm to the officers,” his detention “was\nnot unreasonably prolonged,” and so forth—the Court of\nAppeals proclaimed the officers’ conduct, “in the circum-\nstances presented, reasonable and prudent.” 652 F. 3d\n197, 206 (CA2 2011) (internal quotation marks and brack-\nets omitted); see also post, at 3–4 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\nThat may be so, but it is irrelevant to whether Summers\nauthorized the officers to seize Bailey without probable\ncause. To resolve that issue, a court need ask only one\nquestion: Was the person seized within “the immediate\nvicinity of the premises to be searched”? Ante, at 11.\n  The Court of Appeals read Summers’ spatial constraint\nsomewhat more promiscuously: In its view, it sufficed that\npolice observed Bailey “in the process of leaving the prem-\nises” and detained him “as soon as practicable.” 652 F. 3d,\nat 206 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 6–7. That has\npragmatic appeal; police, the argument runs, should not\nbe precluded from seizing the departing occupant at a\ndistance from the premises if that would be safer than\nstopping him on the front steps. But it rests on the fallacy\nthat each search warrant entitles the Government to a\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nconcomitant Summers detention. Conducting a Summers\nseizure incident to the execution of a warrant “is not the\nGovernment’s right; it is an exception—justified by neces-\nsity—to a rule that would otherwise render the [seizure]\nunlawful.” Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 627\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n   It bears repeating that the “general rule” is “that Fourth\nAmendment seizures are ‘reasonable’ only if based on\nprobable cause.” Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n213 (1979). Summers embodies a categorical judgment\nthat in one narrow circumstance—the presence of occu-\npants during the execution of a search warrant—seizures\nare reasonable despite the absence of probable cause. Sum-\nmers itself foresaw that without clear limits its excep-\ntion could swallow the general rule: If a “multifactor\nbalancing test of ‘reasonable police conduct under the cir-\ncumstances’” were extended “to cover all seizures that do not\namount to technical arrests,” it recognized, the “ ‘protec-\ntions intended by the Framers could all too easily dis-\nappear in the consideration and balancing of the multi-\nfarious circumstances presented by different cases.’ ” 452\nU. S., at 705, n. 19 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at 213 (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). The dissent would\nharvest from Summers what it likes (permission to seize\nwithout probable cause) and leave behind what it finds\nuncongenial (limitation of that permission to a narrow,\ncategorical exception, not an open-ended “reasonableness”\ninquiry).* Summers anticipated that gambit and explicitly\ndisavowed the dissent’s balancing test. See 452 U. S., at\n705, n. 19 (“[T]he rule we adopt today does not depend\n——————\n   * The dissent purports to agree “that the question involves drawing a\nline of demarcation granting a categorical form of detention authority.”\nPost, at 3. What the dissent misses is that a “categorical” exception\nmust be defined by categorical limits. Summers’ authorization to\ndetain applies only to “occupants”—a bright-line limitation that the\ndissent’s “reasonably practicable” test discards altogether.\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nupon such an ad hoc determination”).\n   Regrettably, this Court’s opinion in Summers facilitated\nthe Court of Appeals’ error here by setting forth a smor-\ngasbord of law-enforcement interests assertedly justifying\nits holding, including “preventing flight in the event that\nincriminating evidence is found” and obtaining residents’\nassistance in “open[ing] locked doors or locked containers.”\nId., at 701–703. We should not have been so expansive.\nThe Summers exception is appropriately predicated only\non law enforcement’s interest in carrying out the search\nunimpeded by violence or other disruptions. “The common\ndenominator” of the few Fourth Amendment doctrines\npermitting seizures based on less than probable cause “is\nthe presence of some governmental interest independent\nof the ordinary interest in investigating crime and appre-\nhending suspects.” Id., at 707 (Stewart, J., dissenting).\nPreventing flight is not a special governmental interest—\nit is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in appre-\nhending suspects. Similarly, the interest in inducing\nresidents to open locked doors or containers is nothing\nmore than the ordinary interest in investigating crime.\nThat Summers detentions aid police in uncovering evi-\ndence and nabbing criminals does not distinguish them\nfrom the mine run of seizures unsupported by probable\ncause, which the Fourth Amendment generally proscribes.\n                         *    *    *\n  Summers’ clear rule simplifies the task of officers who\nencounter occupants during a search. “[I]f police are to\nhave workable rules, the balancing of the competing in-\nterests . . . ‘must in large part be done on a categorical\nbasis—not in an ad hoc, case-by-case fashion by individual\npolice officers.’ ” Id., at 705, n. 19 (quoting Dunaway,\nsupra, at 219–220 (White, J., concurring)); see also Ari-\nzona v.

Supp. 2d, at 377.\n   Thus, given Summers, only one question is open. In\nSummers the police detained the occupant before he left\n“the sidewalk outside” of the house. 452 U. S., at 702,\nn. 16. Here the police, for good reason, permitted the\noccupants to leave the premises and stopped them a few\nblocks from the house. App. 48, 72, 86, 103. (See Appen-\ndix, infra.) The resulting question is whether this differ-\nence makes a constitutional difference. In particular,\nwhich is the right constitutional line to demarcate where a\nSummers detention may be initiated? Is it the Court’s\nline, drawn at the “immediate vicinity” of the house? Ante,\nat 12. Or is it the Second Circuit’s line, drawn on the\nbasis of what is “reasonably practicable”? 652 F. 3d, at\n207. I agree, of course, with the concurrence that the\nquestion involves drawing a line of demarcation granting a\ncategorical form of detention authority. The question is\nsimply where that line should be drawn.\n                            III\n   The Court in Summers rested its conclusion upon four\nconsiderations, each of which strongly supports the rea-\nsonableness of Bailey’s detention, and each of which is as\nlikely or more likely to support detention of an occupant\nof searchable premises detained “as soon as reasonably\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npracticable,” 652 F. 3d, at 208, as it is to support the de-\ntention of an occupant detained “within the immediate\nvicinity” of those premises, ante, at 13. First, the Court in\nSummers found “[o]f prime importance . . . the fact that\nthe police had obtained a warrant to search [the occu-\npant’s] house for contraband.” 452 U. S., at 701. That fact\nmeant that the additional detention-related “invasion of\nthe privacy of the persons who resided there” was “less\nintrusive” than in a typical detention. Ibid. The same is\ntrue here and always true in this class of cases.\n   Second, the Court in Summers said that the detention\nwas justified in part by “the legitimate law enforcement\ninterest in preventing flight in the event that incriminat-\ning evidence is found.” Id., at 702. This factor, which\nSummers identifies as the “[m]ost obvious” rationale\nsupporting detention, ibid., will be present in all Summers\ndetentions. Summers applies when police have a search\nwarrant for contraband, id., at 701, 705, n. 20, and any\noccupant departing a residence containing contraband will\nhave incentive to flee once he encounters police. Indeed,\nsince here the warrant itself described the possessor of the\nunlawful gun in terms that applied to both of the detained\noccupants, App. 46, the strength of this interest is equal to\nor greater than its strength in Summers.\n   Third, the Court in Summers said that the detention\nwas justified in part by “the interest in minimizing the\nrisk of harm to the officers.” 452 U. S., at 702. The\nstrength of this interest is greater here than in Summers,\nfor here there was good reason, backed by probable cause,\nto believe that “[a] chrome .380 handgun, ammunition,\n[and] magazine clips” were on the premises. App. 17. As I\ndiscuss below, the interest in minimizing harm to officers\nis compromised by encouraging them to initiate searches\nbefore they are prepared to do so safely.\n   Fourth, the Court in Summers said that “the orderly\ncompletion of the search may be facilitated if the occu-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npants of the premises are present.” 452 U. S., at 703. The\nstrength of this interest here is equal to its strength in\nSummers. See, e.g., United States v. Montieth, 662 F. 3d\n660, 663 (CA4 2011) (After being followed, detained, and\nreturned to his home, Montieth helped officers find “mari-\njuana, firearms, and cash”).\n  The Court in Summers did not emphasize any other\nconsideration.\n                              IV\n   There is, however, one further consideration, namely an\nadministrative consideration. A bright line will some-\ntimes help police more easily administer Fourth Amend-\nment rules, while also helping to ensure that the police do\nnot go beyond the bounds of the reasonable. The majority,\nhowever, offers no easily administered bright line. It de-\nscribes its line as one drawn at “the immediate vicinity\nof the premises to be searched,” to be determined by “a\nnumber of factors . . . including [but not limited to] the\nlawful limits of the premises, whether the occupant was\nwithin the line of sight of his dwelling, the ease of reentry\nfrom the occupant’s location, and other relevant factors.”\nAnte, at 13. The majority’s line invites case-by-case litiga-\ntion although, divorced as it is from interests that directly\nmotivate the Fourth Amendment, it offers no clear case-\nby-case guidance.\n   In any event, as the lower courts pointed out, considera-\ntions related to the risks of flight, of evidence destruction,\nand of physical danger overcome any administrative ad-\nvantages. Consider why the officers here waited until the\noccupants had left the block to stop them: They did so\nbecause the occupants might have been armed.\n   Indeed, even if those emerging occupants were not\narmed (and even if the police knew it), those emerging\noccupants might have seen the officers outside the house.\nAnd they might have alerted others inside the house\n6                 BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhere, as we now know (and the officers had probable\ncause to believe), there was a gun lying on the floor in\nplain view. App. 202. Suppose those inside the house,\nonce alerted, had tried to flee with the evidence. Suppose\nthey had destroyed the evidence. Suppose that one of\nthem had picked up the gun and fired when the officers\nentered. Suppose that an individual inside the house\n(perhaps under the influence of drugs) had grabbed the\ngun and begun to fire through the window, endangering\npolice, neighbors, or families passing by. See id., at 26\n(informant describing gun’s relation to drugs in the\nhouse).\n   Considerations of this kind reveal the dangers inherent\nin the majority’s effort to draw a semi-bright line. And\nthey show the need here and in this class of cases to test\nthe constitutionality of the details of a search warrant’s\nexecution by taking more directly into account concerns\nrelated to safety, evidence, and flight, i.e., the kinds of\nconcerns more directly related to the Fourth Amendment’s\n“ultimate touchstone of . . . reasonableness.” Kentucky v.\nKing, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (slip op., at 5). See New York v. Class, 475 U. S.\n106, 116–117 (1986) (assessing Fourth Amendment rea-\nsonableness “[i]n light of the danger to the officers’ safe-\nty”); Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 110 (1977)\n(per curiam) (“We think it too plain for argument that the\nState’s proffered justification [for a stop]—the safety of the\nofficer—is both legitimate and weighty”). See also Mary-\nland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325, 335, n. 2 (1990) (assessing\nFourth Amendment reasonableness based on “the proper\nbalance between officer safety and citizen privacy”).\n                             V\n  The majority responds by pointing out that the police\n“are not required to stop” “a departing individual.” Ante,\nat 8. Quite right. But that response is not convincing.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nAfter all, the police do not know whether an emerging\nindividual has seen an officer. If he has, the risks are as I\nhave described them, e.g., that those inside may learn of\nimminent police entry and fire the gun. In any event, the\npolice may fear that they might be or have been spotted.\nAnd they may consequently feel the need, under the ma-\njority’s rule, to seize the emerging individual just before he\nleaves the “vicinity” but just too soon to guard against the\ndanger of physical harm inherent in any search for guns.\n   The majority adds that, where the departing individ-\nuals themselves are dangerous, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1\n(1968), may authorize detention. Terry, however, is irrele-\nvant where the risks at issue are those of flight, destruc-\ntion of evidence, or harm caused by those inside the house\nshooting at police or passersby.\n   Finally, the majority creates hypothetical specific exam-\nples of abuse, such as detention “10 miles away” from one’s\nhome at an airport and detention “five hours” after an\noccupant departs from the premises. Ante, at 11, 8. The\nseizures the majority imagines, however, strike me as red\nherrings, for I do not see how they could be justified as\nhaving taken place as soon as “reasonably practicable.”\nIndeed, the majority can find no such example in any\nactual case—even though almost every Court of Appeals to\nhave considered the matter has taken the Second Circuit’s\napproach. See, e.g., Montieth, 662 F. 3d, at 666–669 (“as\nsoon as practicable”); United States v. Cavazos, 288 F. 3d\n706, 711–712 (CA5 2002) (rejecting “geographic proximity”\nas the test under Summers); United States v. Cochran, 939\nF. 2d 337, 338–340 (CA6 1991) (“as soon as practicable”);\nUnited States v. Bullock, 632 F. 3d 1004, 1018–1021 (CA7\n2011) (“as soon as practicable”); United States v. Castro-\nPortillo, 211 Fed. Appx. 715, 720–723 (CA10 2007) (“as\nsoon as practicable”); United States v. Sears, 139 Fed.\nAppx. 162, 166 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (“as soon as\npracticable”).\n8                 BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   While it is true that a hypothetical occupant whom\npolice do not encounter until he is far from the searchable\npremises could engage some of the Summers rationales,\nthat hypothetical occupant would do so significantly less\noften than would an occupant like Bailey. The difference\nis obvious: A hypothetical occupant 10 miles away from\nthe searchable premises is less likely to learn of the search\n(and thus less likely to alert those inside or return to\ndisrupt the search) than is an occupant like Bailey, who\nmay perceive the police presence without alerting the\npolice to the fact that he noticed them.\n   It is even less likely—indeed impossible—that the lower\ncourt’s rule would (as the majority claims) permit “detain-\ning anyone in the neighborhood,” ante, at 9, for the rule\nexplicitly applies only to those “in the process of leaving\nthe premises,” 652 F. 3d, at 206.\n   More fundamentally, Summers explained that detention\nincident to a search is permissible because, once police\nhave obtained a search warrant, they “have an articulable\nbasis for suspecting criminal activity.” 452 U. S., at 699.\nThat articulable, individualized suspicion attaches to the\n“particularly describ[ed] . . . place to be searched.” U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 4. In turn, the connection between individ-\nualized suspicion of that place and individualized suspi-\ncion of “an individual in the process of leaving the premises”\nis sufficiently tight to justify detention. 652 F. 3d, at\n206. That connection dissipates when the individual is not\nactually leaving the premises where, according to a neutral\nmagistrate, there is probable cause to believe contraband\ncan be found, and the Summers justification therefore\ndoes not apply. Hence, Summers applies only where the\nconnection between the searchable premises and the\ndetained occupant is as tight as it is in cases like Summers\nand this one: In both, a departing occupant had just left\nhis home and was merely turned around and escorted\nback there for the duration of a search.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In my view, these latter considerations\nshould govern the Fourth Amendment determination at\nissue here. I consequently dissent.\n10               BAILEY v.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11–770.      Argued November 1, 2012—Decided February 19, 2013\nWhile police were preparing to execute a warrant to search a basement\n apartment for a handgun, detectives conducting surveillance in an\n unmarked car outside the apartment saw two men―later identified\n as petitioner Chunon Bailey and Bryant Middleton―leave the gated\n area above the apartment, get in a car, and drive away. The detec-\n tives waited for the men to leave and then followed the car approxi-\n mately a mile before stopping it. They found keys during a patdown\n search of Bailey, who initially said that he resided in the apartment\n but later denied it when informed of the search. Both men were\n handcuffed and driven in a patrol car to the apartment, where the\n search team had already found a gun and illicit drugs. After arrest-\n ing the men, police discovered that one of Bailey’s keys unlocked the\n apartment’s door.\n    At trial, the District Court denied Bailey’s motion to suppress the\n apartment key and the statements he made to the detectives when\n stopped, holding that Bailey’s detention was justified under Michigan\n v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, as a detention incident to the execution of\n a search warrant, and, in the alternative, that the detention was\n supported by reasonable suspicion under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1.\n Bailey was convicted. The Second Circuit affirmed denial of the sup-\n pression motion. Finding that Summers authorized Bailey’s deten-\n tion, it did not address the alternative Terry holding.\nHeld: The rule in Summers is limited to the immediate vicinity of the\n premises to be searched and does not apply here, where Bailey was\n detained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of the im-\n mediate vicinity of the premises in question. Pp. 4−15.\n    (a) The Summers rule permits officers executing a search warrant\n “to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is con-\n2                       BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ducted,” 452 U. S., at 705, even when there is no particular suspicion\n    that an individual is involved in criminal activity or poses a specific\n    danger to the officers, Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93. Detention is\n    permitted “because the character of the additional intrusion caused\n    by detention is slight and because the justifications for detention are\n    substantial.” Id., at 98. In Summers and later cases the detained oc-\n    cupants were found within or immediately outside the residence be-\n    ing searched. Here, however, petitioner left the apartment before the\n    search began and was detained nearly a mile away. Pp. 4−6.\n       (b) In Summers, the Court recognized three important law en-\n    forcement interests that, taken together, justify detaining an occu-\n    pant who is on the premises during the search warrant’s execution,\n    452 U. S., at 702−703. The first, officer safety, requires officers to se-\n    cure the premises, which may include detaining current occupants so\n    the officers can search without fear that the occupants will become\n    disruptive, dangerous, or otherwise frustrate the search. If an occu-\n    pant returns home during the search, officers can mitigate the risk by\n    taking routine precautions. Here, however, Bailey posed little risk to\n    the officers at the scene after he left the premises, apparently with-\n    out knowledge of the search. Had he returned, he could have been\n    apprehended and detained under Summers. Were police to have the\n    authority to detain persons away from the premises, the authority to\n    detain incident to the execution of a search warrant would reach be-\n    yond the rationale of ensuring the integrity of the search by detain-\n    ing those who are on the scene. As for the Second Circuit’s additional\n    concerns, if officers believe that it would be dangerous to detain a de-\n    parting individual in front of a residence, they are not required to\n    stop him; and if officers have reasonable suspicion of criminal activi-\n    ty, they can instead rely on Terry. The risk that a departing occu-\n    pant might alert those still inside the residence is also an insufficient\n    safety rationale for expanding the detention authority beyond the\n    immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.\n       The second law enforcement interest is the facilitation of the com-\n    pletion of the search. Unrestrained occupants can hide or destroy ev-\n    idence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the way. But a\n    general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search cannot justify de-\n    tention beyond the vicinity of the premises. Occupants who are kept\n    from leaving may assist the officers by opening locked doors or con-\n    tainers in order to avoid the use of force that can damage property or\n    delay completion of the search. But this justification must be con-\n    fined to persons on site as the search warrant is executed and so in a\n    position to observe the progression of the search.\n       The third interest is the interest in preventing flight, which also\n    serves to preserve the integrity of the search. If officers are con-\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cerned about flight in the event incriminating evidence is found, they\n  might rush the search, causing unnecessary damage or compromising\n  its careful execution. The need to prevent flight, however, if un-\n  bounded, might be used to argue for detention of any regular occu-\n  pant regardless of his or her location at the time of the search, e.g.,\n  detaining a suspect 10 miles away, ready to board a plane. Even if\n  the detention of a former occupant away from the premises could fa-\n  cilitate a later arrest if incriminating evidence is discovered, “the\n  mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never\n  by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment.” Mincey v. Ari-\n  zona, 437 U. S. 385, 393.\n     In sum, none of the three law enforcement interests identified in\n  Summers applies with the same or similar force to the detention of\n  recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\n  searched. And each is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an ex-\n  pansion of the rule in Summers to permit the detention of a former\n  occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the\n  search. Pp. 6–12.\n     (c) As recognized in Summers, the detention of a current occupant\n  “represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when\n  the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant,” 452\n  U. S., at 703, but an arrest of an individual away from his home in-\n  volves an additional level of intrusiveness. A public detention, even\n  if merely incident to a search, will resemble a full-fledged arrest and\n  can involve the indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premis-\n  es. P. 12.\n     (d) Limiting the rule in Summers to the area within which an occu-\n  pant poses a real threat to the safe and efficient execution of a search\n  warrant ensures that the scope of the detention incident to a search\n  is confined to its underlying justification. Because petitioner was de-\n  tained at a point beyond any reasonable understanding of immediate\n  vicinity, there is no need to further define that term here. Since de-\n  tention is justified by the interests in executing a safe and efficient\n  search, the decision to detain must be acted upon at the scene of the\n  search and not at a later time in a more remote place.

A search may\nbe of a person, a thing, or a place. So too a seizure may be\nof a person, a thing, or even a place. A search or a seizure\nmay occur singly or in combination, and in differing se-\nquence. In some cases the validity of one determines the\nvalidity of the other. The instant case involves the search\nof a place (an apartment dwelling) and the seizure of a\nperson. But here, though it is acknowledged that the\nsearch was lawful, it does not follow that the seizure was\nlawful as well. The seizure of the person is quite in ques-\ntion. The issue to be resolved is whether the seizure of the\nperson was reasonable when he was stopped and detained\nat some distance away from the premises to be searched\nwhen the only justification for the detention was to ensure\nthe safety and efficacy of the search.\n                            I\n                           A\n At 8:45 p.m. on July 28, 2005, local police obtained a\nwarrant to search a residence for a .380-caliber handgun.\n2                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe residence was a basement apartment at 103 Lake\nDrive, in Wyandanch, New York. A confidential informant\nhad told police he observed the gun when he was at the\napartment to purchase drugs from “a heavy set black male\nwith short hair” known as “Polo.” App. 16–26. As the\nsearch unit began preparations for executing the warrant,\ntwo officers, Detectives Richard Sneider and Richard\nGorbecki, were conducting surveillance in an unmarked\ncar outside the residence. About 9:56 p.m., Sneider and\nGorbecki observed two men—later identified as petitioner\nChunon Bailey and Bryant Middleton—leave the gated\narea above the basement apartment and enter a car\nparked in the driveway. Both matched the general physi-\ncal description of “Polo” provided by the informant. There\nwas no indication that the men were aware of the officers’\npresence or had any knowledge of the impending search.\nThe detectives watched the car leave the driveway. They\nwaited for it to go a few hundred yards down the street\nand followed. The detectives informed the search team of\ntheir intent to follow and detain the departing occupants.\nThe search team then executed the search warrant at the\napartment.\n  Detectives Sneider and Gorbecki tailed Bailey’s car for\nabout a mile—and for about five minutes—before pulling\nthe vehicle over in a parking lot by a fire station. They\nordered Bailey and Middleton out of the car and did a\npatdown search of both men. The officers found no weap-\nons but discovered a ring of keys in Bailey’s pocket. Bailey\nidentified himself and said he was coming from his home\nat 103 Lake Drive. His driver’s license, however, showed\nhis address as Bayshore, New York, the town where the\nconfidential informant told the police the suspect, “Polo,”\nused to live. Id., at 89. Bailey’s passenger, Middleton,\nsaid Bailey was giving him a ride home and confirmed\nthey were coming from Bailey’s residence at 103 Lake\nDrive. The officers put both men in handcuffs. When\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBailey asked why, Gorbecki stated that they were being\ndetained incident to the execution of a search warrant\nat 103 Lake Drive. Bailey responded: “I don’t live there.\nAnything you find there ain’t mine, and I’m not cooperat-\ning with your investigation.” Id., at 57, 77.\n  The detectives called for a patrol car to take Bailey and\nMiddleton back to the Lake Drive apartment. Detective\nSneider drove the unmarked car back, while Detective\nGorbecki used Bailey’s set of keys to drive Bailey’s car\nback to the search scene. By the time the group returned\nto 103 Lake Drive, the search team had discovered a gun\nand drugs in plain view inside the apartment. Bailey and\nMiddleton were placed under arrest, and Bailey’s keys\nwere seized incident to the arrest. Officers later discov-\nered that one of Bailey’s keys opened the door of the\nbasement apartment.\n                             B\n  Bailey was charged with three federal offenses: posses-\nsion of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21\nU. S. C. §§841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(iii); possession of a fire-\narm by a felon, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1); and\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\noffense, in violation of §924(c)(1)(A)(i). At trial Bailey\nmoved to suppress the apartment key and the statements\nhe made when stopped by Detectives Sneider and Gor-\nbecki. That evidence, Bailey argued, derived from an\nunreasonable seizure. After an evidentiary hearing the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of\nNew York denied the motion to suppress. The District\nCourt held that Bailey’s detention was permissible under\nMichigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981), as a detention\nincident to the execution of a search warrant. In the\nalternative, it held that Bailey’s detention was lawful as\nan investigatory detention supported by reasonable suspi-\ncion under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). After a trial\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe jury found Bailey guilty on all three counts.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that\nBailey’s detention was proper and affirmed denial of the\nsuppression motion. It interpreted this Court’s decision\nin Summers to “authoriz[e] law enforcement to detain the\noccupant of premises subject to a valid search warrant\nwhen that person is seen leaving those premises and the\ndetention is effected as soon as reasonably practicable.”\n652 F. 3d 197, 208 (2011). Having found Bailey’s deten-\ntion justified under Summers, the Court of Appeals did not\naddress the District Court’s alternative holding that the\nstop was permitted under Terry.\n   The Federal Courts of Appeals have reached differing\nconclusions as to whether Michigan v. Summers justifies\nthe detention of occupants beyond the immediate vicinity\nof the premises covered by a search warrant. This Court\ngranted certiorari to address the question. 566 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                             II\n  The Fourth Amendment, applicable through the Four-\nteenth Amendment to the States, provides: “The right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons . . . against unrea-\nsonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and\nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . .\nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the\npersons or things to be seized.” This Court has stated “the\ngeneral rule that Fourth Amendment seizures are ‘rea-\nsonable’ only if based on probable cause” to believe that\nthe individual has committed a crime. Dunaway v. New\nYork, 442 U. S. 200, 213 (1979). The standard of probable\ncause, with “roots that are deep in our history,” Henry v.\nUnited States, 361 U. S. 98, 100 (1959), “represent[s] the\naccumulated wisdom of precedent and experience as to\nthe minimum justification necessary to make the kind\nof intrusion involved in an arrest ‘reasonable’ under the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFourth Amendment.” Dunaway, supra, at 208.\n   Within the framework of these fundamental rules there\nis some latitude for police to detain where “the intrusion\non the citizen’s privacy ‘was so much less severe’ than that\ninvolved in a traditional arrest that ‘the opposing interests\nin crime prevention and detection and in the police of-\nficer’s safety’ could support the seizure as reasonable.”\nSummers, supra, at 697–698 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at\n209); see also Terry, supra, at 27 (holding that a police\nofficer who has reasonable suspicion of criminal activity\nmay conduct a brief investigative stop).\n   In Summers, the Court defined an important category of\ncases in which detention is allowed without probable cause\nto arrest for a crime. It permitted officers executing a\nsearch warrant “to detain the occupants of the premises\nwhile a proper search is conducted.” 452 U. S., at 705.\nThe rule in Summers extends farther than some earlier\nexceptions because it does not require law enforcement to\nhave particular suspicion that an individual is involved in\ncriminal activity or poses a specific danger to the officers.\nMuehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93 (2005). In Muehler, apply-\ning the rule in Summers, the Court stated: “An officer’s\nauthority to detain incident to a search is categorical; it\ndoes not depend on the ‘quantum of proof justifying deten-\ntion or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the\nseizure.’ ” 544 U. S., at 98 (quoting Summers, supra, at\n705, n. 19). The rule announced in Summers allows deten-\ntion incident to the execution of a search warrant “because\nthe character of the additional intrusion caused by deten-\ntion is slight and because the justifications for detention\nare substantial.” Muehler, supra, at 98.\n   In Summers and later cases the occupants detained\nwere found within or immediately outside a residence at\nthe moment the police officers executed the search war-\nrant. In Summers, the defendant was detained on a walk\nleading down from the front steps of the house. See Tr. of\n6                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nOral Arg. in O. T. 1980, No. 79–1794, pp. 41–42; see also\nMuehler, supra, at 96 (detention of occupant in adjoining\ngarage); Los Angeles County v. Rettele, 550 U. S. 609, 611\n(2007) (per curiam) (detention of occupants in bedroom).\nHere, however, petitioner left the apartment before the\nsearch began; and the police officers waited to detain him\nuntil he was almost a mile away. The issue is whether the\nreasoning in Summers can justify detentions beyond the\nimmediate vicinity of the premises being searched. An\nexception to the Fourth Amendment rule prohibiting\ndetention absent probable cause must not diverge from its\npurpose and rationale. See Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S.\n491, 500 (1983) (plurality opinion) (“The scope of the de-\ntention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justifi-\ncation”). It is necessary, then, to discuss the reasons for\nthe rule explained in Summers to determine if its ra-\ntionale extends to a detention like the one here.\n                            A\n  In Summers, the Court recognized three important law\nenforcement interests that, taken together, justify the\ndetention of an occupant who is on the premises during\nthe execution of a search warrant: officer safety, facilitat-\ning the completion of the search, and preventing flight.\n452 U. S., at 702–703.\n                               1\n   The first interest identified in Summers was “the inter-\nest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.” Id., at\n702. There the Court held that “the execution of a war-\nrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that\nmay give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to con-\nceal or destroy evidence,” and “[t]he risk of harm to both\nthe police and the occupants is minimized if the officers\nroutinely exercise unquestioned command of the situa-\ntion.” Id., at 702–703.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   When law enforcement officers execute a search war-\nrant, safety considerations require that they secure the\npremises, which may include detaining current occupants.\nBy taking “unquestioned command of the situation,” id., at\n703, the officers can search without fear that occupants,\nwho are on the premises and able to observe the course of\nthe search, will become disruptive, dangerous, or other-\nwise frustrate the search.\n   After Summers, this Court decided Muehler v. Mena.\nThe reasoning and conclusions in Muehler in applying the\nSummers rule go quite far in allowing seizure and deten-\ntion of persons to accommodate the necessities of a search.\nThere, the person detained and held in handcuffs was not\nsuspected of the criminal activity being investigated; but,\nthe Court held, she could be detained nonetheless, to\nsecure the premises while the search was underway. The\n“safety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for\nweapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs,\n[and] the need to detain multiple occupants made the use\nof handcuffs all the more reasonable.” 544 U. S., at 100.\nWhile the Court in Muehler did remand for consideration\nof whether the detention there—alleged to have been two\nor three hours—was necessary in light of all the circum-\nstances, the fact that so prolonged a detention indeed\nmight have been permitted illustrates the far-reaching\nauthority the police have when the detention is made at\nthe scene of the search. This in turn counsels caution\nbefore extending the power to detain persons stopped or\napprehended away from the premises where the search is\nbeing conducted.\n   It is likely, indeed almost inevitable in the case of a\nresident, that an occupant will return to the premises at\nsome point; and this might occur when the officers are still\nconducting the search. Officers can and do mitigate that\nrisk, however, by taking routine precautions, for instance\nby erecting barricades or posting someone on the perime-\n8                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nter or at the door. In the instant case Bailey had left the\npremises, apparently without knowledge of the search. He\nposed little risk to the officers at the scene. If Bailey had\nrushed back to his apartment, the police could have ap-\nprehended and detained him under Summers. There is no\nestablished principle, however, that allows the arrest of\nanyone away from the premises who is likely to return.\n  The risk, furthermore, that someone could return home\nduring the execution of a search warrant is not limited to\noccupants who depart shortly before the start of a search.\nThe risk that a resident might return home, either for\nreasons unrelated to the search or after being alerted by\nsomeone at the scene, exists whether he left five minutes\nor five hours earlier. Unexpected arrivals by occupants or\nother persons accustomed to visiting the premises might\noccur in many instances. Were police to have the authority\nto detain those persons away from the premises, the\nauthority to detain incident to the execution of a search\nwarrant would reach beyond the rationale of ensuring the\nintegrity of the search by detaining those who are in fact\non the scene.\n  The Court of Appeals relied on an additional safety\nconsideration. It concluded that limiting the application of\nthe authority to detain to the immediate vicinity would\nput law enforcement officers in a dilemma. They would\nhave to choose between detaining an individual immedi-\nately (and risk alerting occupants still inside) or allowing\nthe individual to leave (and risk not being able to arrest\nhim later if incriminating evidence were discovered). 652\nF. 3d, at 205–206. Although the danger of alerting occu-\npants who remain inside may be of real concern in some\ninstances, as in the case when a no-knock warrant has\nbeen issued, this safety rationale rests on the false prem-\nise that a detention must take place. If the officers find\nthat it would be dangerous to detain a departing individ-\nual in front of a residence, they are not required to stop\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhim. And, where there are grounds to believe the depart-\ning occupant is dangerous, or involved in criminal activity,\npolice will generally not need Summers to detain him at\nleast for brief questioning, as they can rely instead on\nTerry.\n   The risk that a departing occupant might notice the\npolice surveillance and alert others still inside the resi-\ndence is also an insufficient safety rationale to justify ex-\npanding the existing categorical authority to detain so\nthat it extends beyond the immediate vicinity of the prem-\nises to be searched. If extended in this way the rationale\nwould justify detaining anyone in the neighborhood who\ncould alert occupants that the police are outside, all with-\nout individualized suspicion of criminal activity or connec-\ntion to the residence to be searched. This possibility\ndemonstrates why it is necessary to confine the Summers\nrule to those who are present when and where the search\nis being conducted.\n                               2\n   The second law enforcement interest relied on in Sum-\nmers was that “the orderly completion of the search may\nbe facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.”\n452 U. S., at 703. This interest in efficiency derives from\ndistinct, but related, concerns.\n   If occupants are permitted to wander around the prem-\nises, there is the potential for interference with the execu-\ntion of the search warrant. They can hide or destroy\nevidence, seek to distract the officers, or simply get in the\nway. Those risks are not presented by an occupant who\ndeparts beforehand. So, in this case, after Bailey drove\naway from the Lake Drive apartment, he was not a threat\nto the proper execution of the search. Had he returned,\nofficers would have been free to detain him at that point.\nA general interest in avoiding obstruction of a search,\nhowever, cannot justify detention beyond the vicinity of\n10               BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe premises to be searched.\n   Summers also noted that occupants can assist the offi-\ncers. Under the reasoning in Summers, the occupants’\n“self-interest may induce them to open locked doors or\nlocked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only\ndamaging to property but may also delay the completion of\nthe task at hand.” Ibid. This justification must be con-\nfined to those persons who are on site and so in a position,\nwhen detained, to at once observe the progression of the\nsearch; and it would have no limiting principle were it to\nbe applied to persons beyond the premises of the search.\nHere, it appears the police officers decided to wait until\nBailey had left the vicinity of the search before detaining\nhim. In any event it later became clear to the officers that\nBailey did not wish to cooperate. See App. 57, 77 (“I don’t\nlive there. Anything you find there ain’t mine, and I’m not\ncooperating with your investigation”). And, by the time\nthe officers brought Bailey back to the apartment, the\nsearch team had discovered contraband. Bailey’s deten-\ntion thus served no purpose in ensuring the efficient com-\npletion of the search.\n                               3\n   The third law enforcement interest addressed in Sum-\nmers was the “the legitimate law enforcement interest in\npreventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence\nis found.” 452 U. S., at 702. The proper interpretation of\nthis language, in the context of Summers and in the\nbroader context of the reasonableness standard that must\ngovern and inform the detention incident to a search, is\nthat the police can prohibit an occupant from leaving the\nscene of the search. As with the other interests identified\nin Summers, this justification serves to preserve the integ-\nrity of the search by controlling those persons who are on\nthe scene. If police officers are concerned about flight, and\nhave to keep close supervision of occupants who are not\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrestrained, they might rush the search, causing unneces-\nsary damage to property or compromising its careful exe-\ncution. Allowing officers to secure the scene by detaining\nthose present also prevents the search from being impeded\nby occupants leaving with the evidence being sought or the\nmeans to find it.\n   The concern over flight is not because of the danger of\nflight itself but because of the damage that potential flight\ncan cause to the integrity of the search. This interest does\nnot independently justify detention of an occupant be-\nyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.\nThe need to prevent flight, if unbounded, might be used to\nargue for detention, while a search is underway, of any\nregular occupant regardless of his or her location at the\ntime of the search. If not circumscribed, the rationale of\npreventing flight would justify, for instance, detaining a\nsuspect who is 10 miles away, ready to board a plane. The\ninterest in preventing escape from police cannot extend\nthis far without undermining the usual rules for arrest\nbased on probable cause or a brief stop for questioning\nunder standards derived from Terry. Even if the detention\nof a former occupant away from the premises could facili-\ntate a later arrest should incriminating evidence be dis-\ncovered, “the mere fact that law enforcement may be made\nmore efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the\nFourth Amendment.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385,\n393 (1978).\n   In sum, of the three law enforcement interests identified\nto justify the detention in Summers, none applies with the\nsame or similar force to the detention of recent occupants\nbeyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\nsearched. Any of the individual interests is also insuffi-\ncient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in\nSummers to permit the detention of a former occupant,\nwherever he may be found away from the scene of the\nsearch. This would give officers too much discretion. The\n12               BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncategorical authority to detain incident to the execution of\na search warrant must be limited to the immediate vicini-\nty of the premises to be searched.\n                              B\n   In Summers, the Court recognized the authority to\ndetain occupants incident to the execution of a search\nwarrant not only in light of the law enforcement interests\nat stake but also because the intrusion on personal liberty\nwas limited. The Court held detention of a current occu-\npant “represents only an incremental intrusion on personal\nliberty when the search of a home has been authorized\nby a valid warrant.” 452 U. S., at 703. Because the deten-\ntion occurs in the individual’s own home, “it could add only\nminimally to the public stigma associated with the search\nitself and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the\nindignity associated with a compelled visit to the police\nstation.” Id., at 702.\n   Where officers arrest an individual away from his home,\nhowever, there is an additional level of intrusiveness. A\npublic detention, even if merely incident to a search, will\nresemble a full-fledged arrest. As demonstrated here,\ndetention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an\ninitial detention away from the scene and a second deten-\ntion at the residence. In between, the individual will\nsuffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back\nto the premises, giving all the appearances of an arrest.\nThe detention here was more intrusive than a usual de-\ntention at the search scene. Bailey’s car was stopped; he\nwas ordered to step out and was detained in full public\nview; he was handcuffed, transported in a marked patrol\ncar, and detained further outside the apartment. These\nfacts illustrate that detention away from a premises where\npolice are already present often will be more intrusive\nthan detentions at the scene.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n\n   Summers recognized that a rule permitting the deten-\ntion of occupants on the premises during the execution of a\nsearch warrant, even absent individualized suspicion, was\nreasonable and necessary in light of the law enforcement\ninterests in conducting a safe and efficient search. Be-\ncause this exception grants substantial authority to police\nofficers to detain outside of the traditional rules of the\nFourth Amendment, it must be circumscribed.\n   A spatial constraint defined by the immediate vicinity of\nthe premises to be searched is therefore required for de-\ntentions incident to the execution of a search warrant.\nThe police action permitted here—the search of a resi-\ndence—has a spatial dimension, and so a spatial or geo-\ngraphical boundary can be used to determine the area\nwithin which both the search and detention incident to\nthat search may occur. Limiting the rule in Summers to\nthe area in which an occupant poses a real threat to the\nsafe and efficient execution of a search warrant ensures\nthat the scope of the detention incident to a search is\nconfined to its underlying justification. Once an occupant\nis beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be\nsearched, the search-related law enforcement interests are\ndiminished and the intrusiveness of the detention is more\nsevere.\n   Here, petitioner was detained at a point beyond any\nreasonable understanding of the immediate vicinity of the\npremises in question; and so this case presents neither the\nnecessity nor the occasion to further define the meaning of\nimmediate vicinity. In closer cases courts can consider a\nnumber of factors to determine whether an occupant was\ndetained within the immediate vicinity of the premises to\nbe searched, including the lawful limits of the premises,\nwhether the occupant was within the line of sight of his\ndwelling, the ease of reentry from the occupant’s location,\nand other relevant factors.\n14                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Confining an officer’s authority to detain under Sum-\nmers to the immediate vicinity of a premises to be\nsearched is a proper limit because it accords with the\nrationale of the rule. The rule adopted by the Court of\nAppeals here, allowing detentions of a departed occupant\n“as soon as reasonably practicable,” departs from the\nspatial limit that is necessary to confine the rule in light of\nthe substantial intrusions on the liberty of those detained.\n  Because detention is justified by the interests in execut-\ning a safe and efficient search, the decision to detain must\nbe acted upon at the scene of the search and not at a later\ntime in a more remote place. If officers elect to defer the\ndetention until the suspect or departing occupant leaves\nthe immediate vicinity, the lawfulness of detention is\ncontrolled by other standards, including, of course, a brief\nstop for questioning based on reasonable suspicion under\nTerry or an arrest based on probable cause. A suspect’s\nparticular actions in leaving the scene, including whether\nhe appears to be armed or fleeing with the evidence\nsought, and any information the officers acquire from\nthose who are conducting the search, including infor-\nmation that incriminating evidence has been discovered,\nwill bear, of course, on the lawfulness of a later stop or\ndetention. For example, had the search team radioed\nDetectives Sneider and Gorbecki about the gun and drugs\ndiscovered in the Lake Drive apartment as the officers\nstopped Bailey and Middleton, this may have provided\nthem with probable cause for an arrest.\n                            III\n  Detentions incident to the execution of a search warrant\nare reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because the\nlimited intrusion on personal liberty is outweighed by the\nspecial law enforcement interests at stake. Once an indi-\nvidual has left the immediate vicinity of a premises to be\nsearched, however, detentions must be justified by some\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

In this respect it must be noted that the\nDistrict Court, as an alternative ruling, held that stopping\npetitioner was lawful under Terry. This opinion expresses\nno view on that issue. It will be open, on remand, for the\nCourt of Appeals to address the matter and to determine\nwhether, assuming the Terry stop was valid, it yielded\ninformation that justified the detention the officers then\nimposed.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Summers, 452 U. S. 692 (1981).\n   Summers identified several law-enforcement interests\nsupporting the detention of occupants incident to the\nexecution of a warrant to search for contraband, along\nwith several reasons why such detentions are typically\nless intrusive than an arrest. See id., at 701–704. Weigh-\ning those factors, the Court determined that “it is constitu-\ntionally reasonable to require [a] citizen to remain while\nofficers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his\nhome.” Id., at 705.\n   The existence and scope of the Summers exception were\npredicated on that balancing of the interests and burdens.\nBut—crucially—whether Summers authorizes a seizure in\nan individual case does not depend on any balancing,\nbecause the Summers exception, within its scope, is “cate-\ngorical.” Muehler v. Mena, 544 U. S. 93, 98 (2005). That\nSummers establishes a categorical, bright-line rule is\nsimply not open to debate—Summers itself insisted on it:\n“The rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an\n2                BAILEY v.

S., at 705, n. 19. Where Summers applies, a\nseizure is ipso facto “constitutionally reasonable.” Id., at\n705.\n  The question in this case is whether Summers applies\nat all. It applies only to seizures of “occupants”—that is,\npersons within “the immediate vicinity of the premises to\nbe searched.” Ante, at 11. Bailey was seized a mile\naway. Ergo, Summers cannot sanction Bailey’s detention. It\nreally is that simple.\n  The Court of Appeals’ mistake, echoed by the dissent,\nwas to replace that straightforward, binary inquiry with\nopen-ended balancing. Weighing the equities—Bailey\n“posed a risk of harm to the officers,” his detention “was\nnot unreasonably prolonged,” and so forth—the Court of\nAppeals proclaimed the officers’ conduct, “in the circum-\nstances presented, reasonable and prudent.” 652 F. 3d\n197, 206 (CA2 2011) (internal quotation marks and brack-\nets omitted); see also post, at 3–4 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\nThat may be so, but it is irrelevant to whether Summers\nauthorized the officers to seize Bailey without probable\ncause. To resolve that issue, a court need ask only one\nquestion: Was the person seized within “the immediate\nvicinity of the premises to be searched”? Ante, at 11.\n  The Court of Appeals read Summers’ spatial constraint\nsomewhat more promiscuously: In its view, it sufficed that\npolice observed Bailey “in the process of leaving the prem-\nises” and detained him “as soon as practicable.” 652 F. 3d,\nat 206 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 6–7. That has\npragmatic appeal; police, the argument runs, should not\nbe precluded from seizing the departing occupant at a\ndistance from the premises if that would be safer than\nstopping him on the front steps. But it rests on the fallacy\nthat each search warrant entitles the Government to a\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Conducting a Summers\nseizure incident to the execution of a warrant “is not the\nGovernment’s right; it is an exception—justified by neces-\nsity—to a rule that would otherwise render the [seizure]\nunlawful.” Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615, 627\n(2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n   It bears repeating that the “general rule” is “that Fourth\nAmendment seizures are ‘reasonable’ only if based on\nprobable cause.” Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200,\n213 (1979). Summers embodies a categorical judgment\nthat in one narrow circumstance—the presence of occu-\npants during the execution of a search warrant—seizures\nare reasonable despite the absence of probable cause. Sum-\nmers itself foresaw that without clear limits its excep-\ntion could swallow the general rule: If a “multifactor\nbalancing test of ‘reasonable police conduct under the cir-\ncumstances’” were extended “to cover all seizures that do not\namount to technical arrests,” it recognized, the “ ‘protec-\ntions intended by the Framers could all too easily dis-\nappear in the consideration and balancing of the multi-\nfarious circumstances presented by different cases.’ ” 452\nU. S., at 705, n. 19 (quoting Dunaway, supra, at 213 (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). The dissent would\nharvest from Summers what it likes (permission to seize\nwithout probable cause) and leave behind what it finds\nuncongenial (limitation of that permission to a narrow,\ncategorical exception, not an open-ended “reasonableness”\ninquiry).* Summers anticipated that gambit and explicitly\ndisavowed the dissent’s balancing test. See 452 U. S., at\n705, n. 19 (“[T]he rule we adopt today does not depend\n——————\n   * The dissent purports to agree “that the question involves drawing a\nline of demarcation granting a categorical form of detention authority.”\nPost, at 3. What the dissent misses is that a “categorical” exception\nmust be defined by categorical limits. Summers’ authorization to\ndetain applies only to “occupants”—a bright-line limitation that the\ndissent’s “reasonably practicable” test discards altogether.\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nupon such an ad hoc determination”).\n   Regrettably, this Court’s opinion in Summers facilitated\nthe Court of Appeals’ error here by setting forth a smor-\ngasbord of law-enforcement interests assertedly justifying\nits holding, including “preventing flight in the event that\nincriminating evidence is found” and obtaining residents’\nassistance in “open[ing] locked doors or locked containers.”\nId., at 701–703. We should not have been so expansive.\nThe Summers exception is appropriately predicated only\non law enforcement’s interest in carrying out the search\nunimpeded by violence or other disruptions. “The common\ndenominator” of the few Fourth Amendment doctrines\npermitting seizures based on less than probable cause “is\nthe presence of some governmental interest independent\nof the ordinary interest in investigating crime and appre-\nhending suspects.” Id., at 707 (Stewart, J., dissenting).\nPreventing flight is not a special governmental interest—\nit is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in appre-\nhending suspects. Similarly, the interest in inducing\nresidents to open locked doors or containers is nothing\nmore than the ordinary interest in investigating crime.\nThat Summers detentions aid police in uncovering evi-\ndence and nabbing criminals does not distinguish them\nfrom the mine run of seizures unsupported by probable\ncause, which the Fourth Amendment generally proscribes.\n                         *    *    *\n  Summers’ clear rule simplifies the task of officers who\nencounter occupants during a search. “[I]f police are to\nhave workable rules, the balancing of the competing in-\nterests . . . ‘must in large part be done on a categorical\nbasis—not in an ad hoc, case-by-case fashion by individual\npolice officers.’ ” Id., at 705, n. 19 (quoting Dunaway,\nsupra, at 219–220 (White, J., concurring)); see also Ari-\nzona v.

The Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit found that the police action was reasonable\nbecause (1) the “premises [were] subject to a valid search\nwarrant,” (2) the detained persons were “seen leaving\nthose premises,” and (3) “the detention [was] effected as\nsoon as reasonably practicable.” 652 F. 3d 197, 208 (2011).\nIn light of the risks of flight, of evidence destruction, and\nof human injury present in this and similar cases, I would\nfollow the approach of the Court of Appeals and uphold its\ndetermination.\n                             I\n  The Court of Appeals rested its holding upon well-\nsupported District Court findings. The police stopped the\nmen “at the earliest practicable location that was con-\nsistent with the safety and security of the officers and\nthe public.” 468 F. Supp. 2d 373, 380 (EDNY 2006).\n“[D]etention in open view outside the residence” would\nhave subjected the officers “to additional dangers during\nthe execution of the search,” and it would have “poten-\n2                 BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntially frustrat[ed] the whole purpose of the search due to\ndestruction of evidence.” Id., at 379. It also could have\n    “jeopardize[d] the search or endanger[ed] the lives of\n    the officers . . . by allowing any other occupants inside\n    the residence, who might see or hear the detention of\n    the individual outside the residence as he was leaving,\n    to have some time to (1) destroy or hide incriminating\n    evidence just before the police are about to enter for\n    the search; (2) flee through a back door or window;\n    or (3) arm themselves in preparation for a violent\n    confrontation with the police when they entered to\n    conduct the search.” Id., at 380.\nMoreover, the police stopped the men’s car “at the first\nspot where they determined it was safe to conduct the\nstop,” namely after the car, which had traveled a few\nblocks along busier streets and intersections, turned off on\na quieter side road. Id., at 379.\n                               II\n   The holding by the Court of Appeals is strongly supported\nby Supreme Court precedent. In Michigan v. Summers,\n452 U. S. 692 (1981), this Court held that “a warrant to\nsearch for contraband founded on probable cause implic-\nitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occu-\npants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.”\nId., at 705 (footnote omitted). And the similarities be-\ntween Summers and this case are multiple. In Summers\nthe police had a valid warrant based on probable cause to\nsearch a house for drugs. Id., at 693. Here the police had\na valid warrant based on probable cause to search a house\nfor a gun and ammunition, believed to be used in multiple\ndrug deals. App. 16–18, 26. In Summers the police, be-\nginning to execute that warrant, were outside the house.\n452 U. S., at 693. Here the police, beginning to execute\nthat warrant, were outside the house. 468 F. Supp. 2d, at\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n376. In Summers the police then “encountered” an occu-\npant of the house “descending the front steps.” 452 U. S.,\nat 693. Here the police then encountered two occupants\nof the house ascending the back (basement) steps. 468\nF. Supp. 2d, at 376; App. 43, 45. In Summers the police\nentered the house soon after encountering that occupant.\n452 U. S., at 693. Here the police entered the house soon\nafter encountering those occupants (while other officers\npursued them). App. 49, 59–60. In Summers the police\ndetained the occupant while they engaged in their search.\n452 U. S., at 693. Here the police did the same. 468\nF. Supp. 2d, at 377.\n   Thus, given Summers, only one question is open. In\nSummers the police detained the occupant before he left\n“the sidewalk outside” of the house. 452 U. S., at 702,\nn. 16. Here the police, for good reason, permitted the\noccupants to leave the premises and stopped them a few\nblocks from the house. App. 48, 72, 86, 103. (See Appen-\ndix, infra.) The resulting question is whether this differ-\nence makes a constitutional difference. In particular,\nwhich is the right constitutional line to demarcate where a\nSummers detention may be initiated? Is it the Court’s\nline, drawn at the “immediate vicinity” of the house? Ante,\nat 12. Or is it the Second Circuit’s line, drawn on the\nbasis of what is “reasonably practicable”? 652 F. 3d, at\n207. I agree, of course, with the concurrence that the\nquestion involves drawing a line of demarcation granting a\ncategorical form of detention authority. The question is\nsimply where that line should be drawn.\n                            III\n   The Court in Summers rested its conclusion upon four\nconsiderations, each of which strongly supports the rea-\nsonableness of Bailey’s detention, and each of which is as\nlikely or more likely to support detention of an occupant\nof searchable premises detained “as soon as reasonably\n4                BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npracticable,” 652 F. 3d, at 208, as it is to support the de-\ntention of an occupant detained “within the immediate\nvicinity” of those premises, ante, at 13. First, the Court in\nSummers found “[o]f prime importance . . . the fact that\nthe police had obtained a warrant to search [the occu-\npant’s] house for contraband.” 452 U. S., at 701. That fact\nmeant that the additional detention-related “invasion of\nthe privacy of the persons who resided there” was “less\nintrusive” than in a typical detention. Ibid. The same is\ntrue here and always true in this class of cases.\n   Second, the Court in Summers said that the detention\nwas justified in part by “the legitimate law enforcement\ninterest in preventing flight in the event that incriminat-\ning evidence is found.” Id., at 702. This factor, which\nSummers identifies as the “[m]ost obvious” rationale\nsupporting detention, ibid., will be present in all Summers\ndetentions. Summers applies when police have a search\nwarrant for contraband, id., at 701, 705, n. 20, and any\noccupant departing a residence containing contraband will\nhave incentive to flee once he encounters police. Indeed,\nsince here the warrant itself described the possessor of the\nunlawful gun in terms that applied to both of the detained\noccupants, App. 46, the strength of this interest is equal to\nor greater than its strength in Summers.\n   Third, the Court in Summers said that the detention\nwas justified in part by “the interest in minimizing the\nrisk of harm to the officers.” 452 U. S., at 702. The\nstrength of this interest is greater here than in Summers,\nfor here there was good reason, backed by probable cause,\nto believe that “[a] chrome .380 handgun, ammunition,\n[and] magazine clips” were on the premises. App. 17. As I\ndiscuss below, the interest in minimizing harm to officers\nis compromised by encouraging them to initiate searches\nbefore they are prepared to do so safely.\n   Fourth, the Court in Summers said that “the orderly\ncompletion of the search may be facilitated if the occu-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npants of the premises are present.” 452 U. S., at 703. The\nstrength of this interest here is equal to its strength in\nSummers. See, e.g., United States v. Montieth, 662 F. 3d\n660, 663 (CA4 2011) (After being followed, detained, and\nreturned to his home, Montieth helped officers find “mari-\njuana, firearms, and cash”).\n  The Court in Summers did not emphasize any other\nconsideration.\n                              IV\n   There is, however, one further consideration, namely an\nadministrative consideration. A bright line will some-\ntimes help police more easily administer Fourth Amend-\nment rules, while also helping to ensure that the police do\nnot go beyond the bounds of the reasonable. The majority,\nhowever, offers no easily administered bright line. It de-\nscribes its line as one drawn at “the immediate vicinity\nof the premises to be searched,” to be determined by “a\nnumber of factors . . . including [but not limited to] the\nlawful limits of the premises, whether the occupant was\nwithin the line of sight of his dwelling, the ease of reentry\nfrom the occupant’s location, and other relevant factors.”\nAnte, at 13. The majority’s line invites case-by-case litiga-\ntion although, divorced as it is from interests that directly\nmotivate the Fourth Amendment, it offers no clear case-\nby-case guidance.\n   In any event, as the lower courts pointed out, considera-\ntions related to the risks of flight, of evidence destruction,\nand of physical danger overcome any administrative ad-\nvantages. Consider why the officers here waited until the\noccupants had left the block to stop them: They did so\nbecause the occupants might have been armed.\n   Indeed, even if those emerging occupants were not\narmed (and even if the police knew it), those emerging\noccupants might have seen the officers outside the house.\nAnd they might have alerted others inside the house\n6                 BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhere, as we now know (and the officers had probable\ncause to believe), there was a gun lying on the floor in\nplain view. App. 202. Suppose those inside the house,\nonce alerted, had tried to flee with the evidence. Suppose\nthey had destroyed the evidence. Suppose that one of\nthem had picked up the gun and fired when the officers\nentered. Suppose that an individual inside the house\n(perhaps under the influence of drugs) had grabbed the\ngun and begun to fire through the window, endangering\npolice, neighbors, or families passing by. See id., at 26\n(informant describing gun’s relation to drugs in the\nhouse).\n   Considerations of this kind reveal the dangers inherent\nin the majority’s effort to draw a semi-bright line. And\nthey show the need here and in this class of cases to test\nthe constitutionality of the details of a search warrant’s\nexecution by taking more directly into account concerns\nrelated to safety, evidence, and flight, i.e., the kinds of\nconcerns more directly related to the Fourth Amendment’s\n“ultimate touchstone of . . . reasonableness.” Kentucky v.\nKing, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (internal quotation marks\nomitted) (slip op., at 5). See New York v. Class, 475 U.

S. 106, 110 (1977)\n(per curiam) (“We think it too plain for argument that the\nState’s proffered justification [for a stop]—the safety of the\nofficer—is both legitimate and weighty”). See also Mary-\nland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325, 335, n. 2 (1990) (assessing\nFourth Amendment reasonableness based on “the proper\nbalance between officer safety and citizen privacy”).\n                             V\n  The majority responds by pointing out that the police\n“are not required to stop” “a departing individual.” Ante,\nat 8. Quite right. But that response is not convincing.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nAfter all, the police do not know whether an emerging\nindividual has seen an officer. If he has, the risks are as I\nhave described them, e.g., that those inside may learn of\nimminent police entry and fire the gun. In any event, the\npolice may fear that they might be or have been spotted.\nAnd they may consequently feel the need, under the ma-\njority’s rule, to seize the emerging individual just before he\nleaves the “vicinity” but just too soon to guard against the\ndanger of physical harm inherent in any search for guns.\n   The majority adds that, where the departing individ-\nuals themselves are dangerous, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1\n(1968), may authorize detention. Terry, however, is irrele-\nvant where the risks at issue are those of flight, destruc-\ntion of evidence, or harm caused by those inside the house\nshooting at police or passersby.\n   Finally, the majority creates hypothetical specific exam-\nples of abuse, such as detention “10 miles away” from one’s\nhome at an airport and detention “five hours” after an\noccupant departs from the premises. Ante, at 11, 8. The\nseizures the majority imagines, however, strike me as red\nherrings, for I do not see how they could be justified as\nhaving taken place as soon as “reasonably practicable.”\nIndeed, the majority can find no such example in any\nactual case—even though almost every Court of Appeals to\nhave considered the matter has taken the Second Circuit’s\napproach. See, e.g., Montieth, 662 F. 3d, at 666–669 (“as\nsoon as practicable”); United States v. Cavazos, 288 F. 3d\n706, 711–712 (CA5 2002) (rejecting “geographic proximity”\nas the test under Summers); United States v.

Sears, 139 Fed.\nAppx. 162, 166 (CA11 2005) (per curiam) (“as soon as\npracticable”).\n8                 BAILEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   While it is true that a hypothetical occupant whom\npolice do not encounter until he is far from the searchable\npremises could engage some of the Summers rationales,\nthat hypothetical occupant would do so significantly less\noften than would an occupant like Bailey. The difference\nis obvious: A hypothetical occupant 10 miles away from\nthe searchable premises is less likely to learn of the search\n(and thus less likely to alert those inside or return to\ndisrupt the search) than is an occupant like Bailey, who\nmay perceive the police presence without alerting the\npolice to the fact that he noticed them.\n   It is even less likely—indeed impossible—that the lower\ncourt’s rule would (as the majority claims) permit “detain-\ning anyone in the neighborhood,” ante, at 9, for the rule\nexplicitly applies only to those “in the process of leaving\nthe premises,” 652 F. 3d, at 206.\n   More fundamentally, Summers explained that detention\nincident to a search is permissible because, once police\nhave obtained a search warrant, they “have an articulable\nbasis for suspecting criminal activity.” 452 U. S., at 699.\nThat articulable, individualized suspicion attaches to the\n“particularly describ[ed] . . . place to be searched.” U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 4. In turn, the connection between individ-\nualized suspicion of that place and individualized suspi-\ncion of “an individual in the process of leaving the premises”\nis sufficiently tight to justify detention. 652 F. 3d, at\n206. That connection dissipates when the individual is not\nactually leaving the premises where, according to a neutral\nmagistrate, there is probable cause to believe contraband\ncan be found, and the Summers justification therefore\ndoes not apply. Hence, Summers applies only where the\nconnection between the searchable premises and the\ndetained occupant is as tight as it is in cases like Summers\nand this one: In both, a departing occupant had just left\nhis home and was merely turned around and escorted\nback there for the duration of a search.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.
