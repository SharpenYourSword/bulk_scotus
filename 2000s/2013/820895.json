WILLIAMS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u2013465.      Argued October 3, 2012\u2014Decided February 20, 2013\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)\n  provides that a federal habeas court may not grant relief to a state\n  prisoner whose claim has already been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in\n  State court,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d), unless the claim\u2019s adjudication re-\n  sulted in a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasona-\n  ble application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n  [this] Court,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determina-\n  tion of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\n  proceeding,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2).\n     A California jury convicted respondent Williams of first-degree\n  murder. On direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal, she\n  claimed that the trial court\u2019s questioning and dismissal of a juror\n  during deliberations violated both the Sixth Amendment and Cali-\n  fornia law. In holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for\n  bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted the definition of \u201cimpar-\n  tiality\u201d from United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145\u2013146, but it did\n  not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment\n  issue. The State Supreme Court remanded for further consideration\n  in light of its intervening Cleveland decision, which held that a trial\n  court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a ju-\n  ror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the evi-\n  dence. Reaffirming its prior decision on remand, the State Court of\n  Appeal discussed Cleveland, again quoted Wood, and failed to ex-\n  pressly acknowledge that Williams had raised a federal claim.\n     When Williams later sought federal habeas relief, the District\n  Court applied \u00a72254\u2019s deferential standard of review for claims adju-\n  dicated on the merits and denied relief. But the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that the State Court of Appeal had not considered Williams\u2019\n2                       JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Sixth Amendment claim. The court then reviewed that claim de novo\n    and held that the questioning and dismissal of the juror violated the\n    Sixth Amendment.\nHeld:\n    1. For purposes of \u00a72254(d), when a state court rules against a de-\n fendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendant\u2019s claims but\n does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court\n must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudi-\n cated on the merits. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (a) This conclusion follows logically from Harrington v. Richter,\n 562 U. S. ___. There, the Court held that when a state court issues\n an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims\n raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant\n subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court\n must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.\n Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address\n any of the defendant\u2019s claims, there is no sound reason not to apply\n its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not\n all of those claims. Federal habeas courts should not assume that\n any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state\n courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by\n a defendant. In fact, they frequently take a different course. They\n may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related\n federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a\n provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as suffi-\n cient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too in-\n substantial to merit discussion. Pp. 7\u221210.\n       (b) Petitioner\u2019s argument for an irrebuttable presumption goes\n too far. Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard,\n the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the\n merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8. But where, e.g., the state\n standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in\n passing, the presumption may be rebutted\u2014either by a habeas peti-\n tioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de\n novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be re-\n garded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman v. Thompson, 501\n U. S. 722, 739. An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never\n overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong. It would also im-\n properly excise \u00a72254(d)\u2019s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that\n is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated\n on the merits. The experience of the lower federal courts shows that\n allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not\n prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation. Pp. 10\u221213.\n    2. Applying the rebuttable presumption of merits adjudication\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Several facts\n  lead to that conclusion. Most important is that the court discussed\n  Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three\n  Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the Sixth Amendment im-\n  plications of discharging holdout jurors. Though Cleveland refused to\n  follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not\n  bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional\n  question. Regardless of whether a California court would consider\n  Williams\u2019 state-law and Sixth Amendment claims to be coextensive,\n  their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal de-\n  cided one while overlooking the other. The State Court of Appeal\u2019s\n  quotation of Wood, supra, at 145\u2212146, further confirms that it was\n  well aware that the juror\u2019s questioning and dismissal implicated fed-\n  eral law. Williams\u2019 litigation strategy also supports this result. She\n  treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not\n  surprising that the state courts did as well. Notably, Williams nei-\n  ther petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in\n  subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had\n  failed to adjudicate her Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.\n  Pp. 13\u221216.\n646 F. 3d 626, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

TARA SHENEVA WILLIAMS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA) restricts the circumstances under which a\nfederal habeas court may grant relief to a state prisoner\nwhose claim has already been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\nin State court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). Specifically, if a\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court,\u201d\na federal habeas court may not grant relief unless \u201cthe\nadjudication of the claim\u2014\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\n    Ibid.\n  Because the requirements of \u00a72254(d) are difficult to\nmeet, it is important whether a federal claim was \u201cadjudi-\ncated on the merits in State court,\u201d and this case requires\nus to ascertain the meaning of the adjudication-on-the\n2                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits requirement. This issue arises when a defendant\nconvicted in state court attempts to raise a federal claim,\neither on direct appeal or in a collateral state proceeding,\nand a state court rules against the defendant and issues\nan opinion that addresses some issues but does not ex-\npressly address the federal claim in question. If this\ndefendant then raises the same claim in a federal habeas\nproceeding, should the federal court regard the claim as\nhaving been adjudicated on the merits by the state court\nand apply deference under \u00a72254(d)? Or may the federal\ncourt assume that the state court simply overlooked the\nfederal claim and proceed to adjudicate the claim de novo,\nthe course taken by the Court of Appeals in the case at\nhand?\n  We believe that the answer to this question follows\nlogically from our decision in Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). In that case, we held that, when a state\ncourt issues an order that summarily rejects without\ndiscussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including\na federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in\na federal habeas proceeding, the federal habeas court must\npresume (subject to rebuttal) that the federal claim was\nadjudicated on the merits. We see no reason why this\nsame rule should not apply when the state court addresses\nsome of the claims raised by a defendant but not a claim\nthat is later raised in a federal habeas proceeding.\n  Applying this rule in the present case, we hold that the\nfederal claim at issue here (a Sixth Amendment jury trial\nclaim) must be presumed to have been adjudicated on the\nmerits by the California courts, that this presumption was\nnot adequately rebutted, that the restrictive standard of\nreview set out in \u00a72254(d)(2) consequently applies, and\nthat under that standard respondent is not entitled to\nhabeas relief. We therefore reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n                                 I\n\n                                 A\n\n   In October 1993, respondent Tara Williams took two\nof her friends for a drive in southern California with\nthe objective of committing a robbery. They stopped at a\nliquor store in Long Beach, and while Williams waited in\nthe getaway car, her friends stole money from the cash\nregister and fatally shot the store\u2019s owner. Williams then\ndrove one of her friends away, and the other fled on foot.\nWilliams avoided capture for five years but was ultimately\napprehended and charged with first-degree murder.\n   At trial, Williams admitted that she had served as the\ngetaway driver but claimed that she did not know that her\nfriends were going to rob the liquor store at the particular\ntime in question. Instead, she contended that the three\nfriends had agreed only that they would \u201ccase\u201d the store\nand would possibly return later that evening to rob it. The\nState countered that, regardless of whether Williams\nknew precisely when and where the robbery was to take\nplace, she had agreed to help commit a robbery and that\nthis was sufficient to provide the predicate for felony\nmurder under California law.\n   After deliberating for about three hours, the jury fore-\nman sent the judge two notes. The first note asked the\nfollowing question:\n        \u201c \u2018Is it legally permissible for a juror to interpret . . .\n     the jury instructions to mean that the conspiracy\n     should involve a plan to commit a specific robbery ra-\n     ther than a general plan to commit robberies in the\n     future?\u2019 \u201d Tr. 1247.\nThe second note stated:\n     \u201cI wish to inform you that we have one juror who . . .\n     has expressed an intention to disregard the law . . .\n     and . . . has expressed concern relative to the severity\n     of the charge (first degree murder).\u201d Id., at 1246.\n4                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe judge told the jury that the answer to the question in\nthe first note was \u201cno.\u201d Id., at 1249. Then, over Williams\u2019\nobjection, the judge briefly questioned the foreman outside\nthe presence of the rest of the jury about the second note.\nThe foreman said that he thought the judge\u2019s answer to\nthe first note might resolve the problem, and the judge\ninstructed the jury to resume its deliberations.\n   The next morning, once again over Williams\u2019 objection,\nthe judge decided to inquire further about the foreman\u2019s\nsecond note. On questioning by the judge and lawyers for\nboth parties, the foreman testified that Juror 6 had\nbrought up past instances of jury nullification. The fore-\nman also expressed doubt about whether Juror 6 was\nwilling to apply the felony-murder rule. The trial judge\nthen ordered questioning of Juror 6, who first denied and\nthen admitted bringing up instances of nullification.\nJuror 6 also testified that this was a serious case and that\nhe would vote to convict only if he was \u201cvery convinced . . .\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 1280. He later clari-\nfied that in his view \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\u201d and \u201cvery convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\nmeant the same thing. Id., at 1281. After taking testi-\nmony from the remaining jurors, who corroborated the\nforeman\u2019s testimony to varying degrees, the trial judge dis-\nmissed Juror 6 for bias. With an alternate juror in place,\nthe jury convicted Williams of first-degree murder.\n                             B\n  On appeal to the California Court of Appeal, Williams\nargued, among other things, that the discharge of Juror 6\nviolated both the Sixth Amendment and the California\nPenal Code, which allows a California trial judge to dis-\nmiss a juror who \u201cupon . . . good cause shown to the court\nis found to be unable to perform his or her duty.\u201d Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a71089 (West 2004). Although Williams\u2019\nbrief challenged the questioning and dismissal of Juror 6\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\non both state and federal grounds, it did not clearly distin-\nguish between these two lines of authority.\n   In a written opinion affirming Williams\u2019 conviction,\nthe California Court of Appeal devoted several pages to\ndiscussing the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s decision to dis-\nmiss the juror. People v. Taylor, No. B137365 (Mar. 27,\n2001). The court held that Juror 6 had been properly\ndismissed for bias and quoted this Court\u2019s definition of\n\u201cimpartiality\u201d in United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123,\n145\u2013146 (1936). But despite its extended discussion of\nJuror 6\u2019s dismissal and the questioning that preceded it,\nthe California Court of Appeal never expressly acknowl-\nedged that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment issue.\n   Williams petitioned the California Supreme Court for\nreview, and while her petition was pending, that court\ndecided People v. Cleveland, 25 Cal. 4th 466, 21 P. 3d 1225\n(2001), which held that a trial court had abused its discre-\ntion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a juror who\nappeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the\nevidence. The California Supreme Court granted Wil-\nliams\u2019 petition for review and remanded her case for fur-\nther consideration in light of this intervening authority.\nPeople v. Taylor, No. S097387 (July 11, 2001).\n   On remand, the California Court of Appeal issued a\nrevised opinion holding that the trial court had not abused\nits discretion by questioning the jury and dismissing Juror\n6. Williams argued that Juror 6\u2014like the holdout juror in\nCleveland\u2014was dismissed because he was uncooperative\nwith other jurors who did not share his view of the evi-\ndence. But the California Court of Appeal disagreed,\nexplaining that Williams\u2019 argument \u201cnot only misstate[d]\nthe evidence,\u201d but also \u201cignore[d] the trial court\u2019s explana-\ntion that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had\nshown himself to be biased, not because he was failing to\ndeliberate or engaging in juror nullification.\u201d People v.\nTaylor, No. B137365 (Jan. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n6                     JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n105a. As in its earlier opinion, the California Court of\nAppeal quoted our definition of juror bias in Wood, but the\ncourt did not expressly acknowledge that Williams had\ninvoked a federal basis for her argument. Despite that\nomission, however, Williams did not seek rehearing or other-\nwise suggest that the court had overlooked her federal\nclaim. Instead, she filed another petition for review in\nthe California Supreme Court, but this time that court\ndenied relief in a one-sentence order. People v. Taylor, No.\nS104661 (Apr. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a.\n   Williams sought but failed to obtain relief through state\nhabeas proceedings, and she then filed a federal habeas\npetition under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District Court ap-\nplied AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review for claims\npreviously adjudicated on the merits and denied relief.\nWilliams v. Mitchell, No. 03\u20132691 (CD Cal., May 30,\n2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. In so holding, the Dis-\ntrict Court adopted a Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that the\nevidence \u201camply support[ed] the trial judge\u2019s determina-\ntion that good cause existed for the discharge of Juror 6.\u201d\nWilliams v. Mitchell, No. 03\u20132691 (CD Cal., Mar. 19,\n2007), id., at 70a.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed. Unlike the District Court,\nthe Ninth Circuit declined to apply the deferential stand-\nard of review contained in \u00a72254(d). The Ninth Circuit\ntook this approach because it thought it \u201cobvious\u201d that the\nState Court of Appeal had \u201coverlooked or disregarded\u201d\nWilliams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim.1 Williams v. Cavazos,\n646 F. 3d 626, 639 (2011). The Ninth Circuit reasoned\nthat Cleveland, the State Supreme Court decision on\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Consistent with our decision in Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.

Reviewing Williams\u2019 Sixth\nAmendment claim de novo, the Ninth Circuit applied its\nown precedent and held that the questioning and dismis-\nsal of Juror 6 violated the Sixth Amendment. 646 F. 3d, at\n646\u2013647. We granted the warden\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, 565 U.

S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). In Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), we\nheld that \u00a72254(d) \u201cdoes not require a state court to give\nreasons before its decision can be deemed to have been\n\u2018adjudicated on the merits.\u2019 \u201d       Rather, we explained,\n\u201c[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court\nand the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed\nthat the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in\nthe absence of any indication or state-law procedural\nprinciples to the contrary.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  Our reasoning in Richter points clearly to the answer to\nthe question presented in the case at hand. Although\nRichter itself concerned a state-court order that did not\naddress any of the defendant\u2019s claims, we see no reason\nwhy the Richter presumption should not also apply when a\nstate-court opinion addresses some but not all of a defend-\nant\u2019s claims. There would be a reason for drawing a dis-\ntinction between these two situations if opinions issued by\nstate appellate courts always separately addressed every\n8                  JOHNSON v.

If\nthere were such a uniform practice, then federal habeas\ncourts could assume that any unaddressed federal claim\nwas simply overlooked.\n   No such assumption is warranted, however, because it is\nnot the uniform practice of busy state courts to discuss\nseparately every single claim to which a defendant makes\neven a passing reference. On the contrary, there are\nseveral situations in which state courts frequently take a\ndifferent course.\n   First, there are circumstances in which a line of state\nprecedent is viewed as fully incorporating a related federal\nconstitutional right. In California, for example, the state\nconstitutional right to be present at trial \u201c \u2018is generally\ncoextensive with\u2019 \u201d the protections of the Federal Constitu-\ntion. People v. Butler, 46 Cal. 4th 847, 861, 209 P. 3d 596,\n606 (2009); see also, e.g., Commonwealth v. Prunty, 462\nMass. 295, 305, n. 14, 968 N. E. 2d 361, 371, n. 14 (2012)\n(standard for racial discrimination in juror selection \u201c \u2018is\nthe same under the Federal Constitution and the [Massa-\nchusetts] Declaration of Rights\u2019 \u201d); State v. Krause, 817\nN. W. 2d 136, 144 (Minn. 2012) (\u201c \u2018The due process protec-\ntion provided under the Minnesota Constitution is identi-\ncal to the due proces[s] guaranteed under the Constitution\nof the United States\u2019 \u201d); State v. Engelhardt, 280 Kan. 113,\n122, 119 P. 3d 1148, 1158 (2005) (observing that a Kansas\nstatute is \u201canalytically and functionally identical to the\nrequirements under the Confrontation Clause and the Due\nProcess Clause of the federal Constitution\u201d). In this situa-\ntion, a state appellate court may regard its discussion of\nthe state precedent as sufficient to cover a claim based on\nthe related federal right.\n   Second, a state court may not regard a fleeting reference\nto a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal prece-\ndent as sufficient to raise a separate federal claim. Federal\ncourts of appeals refuse to take cognizance of arguments\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthat are made in passing without proper development.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cloud, 680 F. 3d 396, 409, n. 7\n(CA4 2012); United States v. Mitchell, 502 F. 3d 931, 953,\nn. 2 (CA9 2007); United States v. Charles, 469 F. 3d 402,\n408 (CA5 2006); Reynolds v. Wagner, 128 F. 3d 166, 178\n(CA3 1997); Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC\n1983). State appellate courts are entitled to follow the\nsame practice.\n   Third, there are instances in which a state court may\nsimply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discus-\nsion. Indeed, the California Court of Appeal has expressly\nstated that it has no obligation to address claims that lack\narguable merit. See People v. Rojas, 118 Cal. App. 3d 278,\n290, 173 Cal. Rptr. 91, 93 (1981). That court has ex-\nplained: \u201cIn an era in which there is concern that the\nquality of justice is being diminished by appellate backlog\nwith its attendant delay, which in turn contributes to a\nlack of finality of judgment, it behooves us as an appellate\ncourt to \u2018get to the heart\u2019 of cases presented and dispose of\nthem expeditiously.\u201d Ibid. See also People v. Burke, 18\nCal. App. 72, 79, 122 P. 435, 439 (1912) (\u201cThe author of an\nopinion . . . must follow his own judgment as to the degree\nof elaboration to be accorded to the treatment of any prop-\nosition and as to the questions which are worthy of notice\nat all\u201d (emphasis added)). While it is preferable for an\nappellate court in a criminal case to list all of the argu-\nments that the court recognizes as having been properly\npresented, see R. Aldisert, Opinion Writing 95\u201396 (3d ed.\n2012), federal courts have no authority to impose manda-\ntory opinion-writing standards on state courts, see Cole-\nman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 739 (1991) (\u201c[W]e have\nno power to tell state courts how they must write their\nopinions\u201d). The caseloads shouldered by many state appel-\nlate courts are very heavy,2 and the opinions issued by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 See,   e.g., Judicial Council of California, 2011 Court Statistics Re-\n10                     JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthese courts must be read with that factor in mind.\n  In sum, because it is by no means uncommon for a state\ncourt to fail to address separately a federal claim that the\ncourt has not simply overlooked, we see no sound reason\nfor failing to apply the Richter presumption in cases like\nthe one now before us. When a state court rejects a federal\nclaim without expressly addressing that claim, a federal\nhabeas court must presume that the federal claim was\nadjudicated on the merits\u2014but that presumption can in\nsome limited circumstances be rebutted.\n                              B\n   Not satisfied with a strong but rebuttable presumption,\npetitioner urges us to make the presumption irrebuttable.\nSpecifically, petitioner contends that a state court must be\nregarded as having adjudicated a federal claim on the\nmerits if the state court addressed \u201cthe substance of [an]\nasserted trial error.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27. Suppose, for\nexample, that a defendant claimed in state court that\nsomething that occurred at trial violated both a provision\nof the Federal Constitution and a related provision of state\nlaw, and suppose further that the state court, in denying\nrelief, made no reference to federal law.

To be sure, if the state-law\nrule subsumes the federal standard\u2014that is, if it is\nat least as protective as the federal standard\u2014then the\nfederal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated\non the merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002)\n(per curiam). But what if, for example, in at least some\ncircumstances the state standard is less protective? Or\nwhat if the state standard is quite different from the\nfederal standard, and the defendant\u2019s papers made no\neffort to develop the basis for the federal claim? What if a\nprovision of the Federal Constitution or a federal prece-\ndent was simply mentioned in passing in a footnote or was\nburied in a string cite? In such circumstances, the pre-\nsumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the\nmerits may be rebutted\u2014either by the habeas petitioner\n(for the purpose of showing that the claim should be con-\nsidered by the federal court de novo) or by the State (for\nthe purpose of showing that the federal claim should be\nregarded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman, supra,\nat 739 (rebuttable presumption of no independent and\nadequate state ground applies so long as \u201cit fairly appears\nthat a state court judgment rested primarily on federal\nlaw or was interwoven with federal law\u201d). Thus, while the\nRichter presumption is a strong one that may be rebutted\nonly in unusual circumstances, it is not irrebuttable.3 \u201cPer\nse rules should not be applied . . . in situations where the\ngeneralization is incorrect as an empirical matter,\u201d Cole-\nman, 501 U. S., at 737, and an irrebuttable presumption\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For example, when a defendant does so little to raise his claim that\nhe fails to \u201c \u2018fairly present\u2019 \u201d it in \u201ceach appropriate state court,\u201d Bald-\nwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 29 (2004), the Richter presumption is fully\nrebutted.\n12                 JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat state courts never overlook federal claims would\noccasionally miss the mark.\n   The language of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) makes it clear that\nthis provision applies only when a federal claim was \u201cad-\njudicated on the merits in State court.\u201d A judgment is\nnormally said to have been rendered \u201con the merits\u201d only\nif it was \u201cdelivered after the court . . . heard and evaluated\nthe evidence and the parties\u2019 substantive arguments.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1199 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis\nadded). And as used in this context, the word \u201cmerits\u201d is\ndefined as \u201c[t]he intrinsic rights and wrongs of a case as\ndetermined by matters of substance, in distinction from\nmatters of form.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1540 (2d ed. 1954) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., 9 Ox-\nford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cthe intrinsic\n\u2018rights and wrongs\u2019 of the matter, in contradistinction to\nextraneous points such as the competence of the tribunal\nor the like\u201d (emphasis added)); Random House Dictionary\nof the English Language 897 (1967) (\u201cthe intrinsic right\nand wrong of a matter, as a law case, unobscured by pro-\ncedural details, technicalities, personal feelings, etc.\u201d\n(emphasis added)). If a federal claim is rejected as a\nresult of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evaluated\nbased on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA is surely correct that such claims have\nbeen adjudicated and present federal questions we may\nreview, post, at 3\u20134, but it does not follow that they have\nbeen adjudicated \u201con the merits.\u201d By having us neverthe-\nless apply AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review in such\ncases, petitioner\u2019s argument would improperly excise\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s on-the-merits requirement.\n   Nor does petitioner\u2019s preferred approach follow inexora-\nbly from AEDPA\u2019s deferential architecture. Even while\nleaving \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for adjudicating federal\nclaims to the States, Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 27\n(2002) (per curiam), AEDPA permits de novo review in\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930,\n953 (2007). When the evidence leads very clearly to the\nconclusion that a federal claim was inadvertently over-\nlooked in state court, \u00a72254(d) entitles the prisoner to an\nunencumbered opportunity to make his case before a fed-\neral judge.\n  We are not persuaded that applying a rebuttable pre-\nsumption in this context will be unduly burdensome for\nfederal courts. Before Richter, every Court of Appeals to\nconsider the issue allowed a prisoner to argue that a state\ncourt had overlooked his federal claim.4 That approach\ndid not prompt an unmanageable flood of litigation, and\nwe see no reason to fear that it will do so now.\n                             III\n   Applying the presumption of merits adjudication to the\nfacts of this case, we hold that the Ninth Circuit erred by\nfinding that the California Court of Appeal overlooked\nWilliams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. Several facts make\nthis conclusion inescapable.\n   Most important is the state court\u2019s discussion of Cleve-\nland, 25 Cal. 4th 466, 21 P. 3d 1225, a California Supreme\nCourt decision on which the Court of Appeal solicited\nbriefing. Cleveland held that a California trial court, \u201cif\nput on notice that a juror is not participating in delib-\nerations,\u201d may \u201cconduct \u2018whatever inquiry is reasonably\nnecessary to determine\u2019 whether such grounds exist and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See, e.g., Lyell v.

The\nCleveland court acknowledged \u201c[t]he need to protect the\nsanctity of jury deliberations,\u201d id., at 476, 21 P. 3d, at\n1231, and included a lengthy discussion of three Federal\nCourt of Appeals cases that it said had \u201cconsidered these\nissues in depth,\u201d id., at 480\u2013484, 21 P. 3d, at 1234\u20131237.\nThose three cases\u2014United States v. Symington, 195 F. 3d\n1080 (CA9 1999), United States v. Thomas, 116 F. 3d 606\n(CA2 1997), and United States v. Brown, 823 F. 2d 591\n(CADC 1987)\u2014concern the discharge of holdout jurors in\nfederal court. Each case discusses the Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial and concludes that a trial court should\nnot inquire further if it appears that there is \u201c \u2018any reason-\nable possibility that the impetus for a juror\u2019s dismissal\nstems from the juror\u2019s views on the merits of the case.\u2019 \u201d\nCleveland, supra, at 484, 21 P. 3d, at 1237 (quoting Sym-\nington, supra, at 1087); see also Thomas, supra, at 621\u2013\n622; Brown, supra, at 596. Though the Cleveland court\nfound much to praise in these decisions, it expressly de-\nclined to follow them on this point. 25 Cal. 4th, at 483\u2013\n484, 21 P. 3d, at 1236\u20131237.\n    Cleveland did not expressly purport to decide a federal\nconstitutional question, but its discussion of Symington,\nThomas, and Brown shows that the California Supreme\nCourt understood itself to be deciding a question with\nfederal constitutional dimensions. See 25 Cal. 4th, at 487,\n21 P. 3d, at 1239 (Werdegar, J., concurring) (emphasizing\nimportance of careful appellate review in juror discharge\ncases in light of the \u201cconstitutional dimension to the prob-\nlem\u201d). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine the California\nSupreme Court announcing an interpretation of Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a71089 that it believed to be less protective than\nthe Sixth Amendment, as any such interpretation would\nprovide no guidance to state trial judges bound to follow\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nboth state and federal law.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rested\non the fact that Cleveland refused to follow Symington,\nBrown, and Thomas. 646 F. 3d, at 640. But the views of\nthe federal courts of appeals do not bind the California\nSupreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional\nquestion, and disagreeing with the lower federal courts is\nnot the same as ignoring federal law. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s\napparent assumption that the California Supreme Court\ncould not refuse to follow federal court of appeals prece-\ndent without disregarding the Federal Constitution would\nundo \u00a72254(d)\u2019s \u201ccontrary to\u201d provision, which requires\ndeference unless a state court fails to follow Supreme\nCourt precedent. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   Regardless of whether a California court would consider\nWilliams\u2019 \u00a71089 and Sixth Amendment claims to be per-\nfectly coextensive, the fact that these claims are so similar\nmakes it unlikely that the California Court of Appeal\ndecided one while overlooking the other. Indeed, it is dif-\nficult to imagine any panel of appellate judges reading\nCleveland and passing on the propriety of dismissing a\nholdout juror under \u00a71089 without realizing that such\nsituations also bear on the federal constitutional right to a\nfair trial. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s quotation of\nour definition of \u201cimpartiality\u201d from Wood, 299 U. S., at\n145\u2013146, points to the same conclusion, confirming that\nthe state court was well aware that the questioning and\ndismissal of Juror 6 implicated both state and federal law.\n   Williams\u2019 litigation strategy supports the same result.\nThroughout her state proceedings, Williams treated her\nstate and federal claims as interchangeable, and it is\nhardly surprising that the state courts did so as well. See\nBrief for Appellant in No. B137365 (Cal. App.), App. 29\n(citing \u00a71089 precedent and concluding that Williams \u201cwas\naccordingly denied her Sixth Amendment right to a unan-\nimous jury\u201d).

The\npossibility that the California Court of Appeal had simply\noverlooked Williams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim apparently\ndid not occur to anyone until that issue was raised by two\njudges during the oral argument in the Ninth Circuit. See\n646 F. 3d, at 638, n. 7.

In my view the rebuttal must consist of a show-\ning, based on the explicit text of the court\u2019s order, or upon\nstandard practice and understanding in the jurisdiction\nwith regard to the meaning of an ambiguous text, that the\njudgment did not purport to decide the federal question.\n\u201cDecided after due consideration\u201d is not, and has never\nbeen, the meaning of the legal term of art \u201cdecided on the\nmerits,\u201d and giving it that meaning burdens our lower\ncourts with an unusual subjective inquiry that demeans\nstate courts and will be a fertile source of litigation and\ndelay.\n  In the Court\u2019s view, a habeas petitioner receives de novo\nreview if he can prove that the state court, although ad-\ndressing his state claim, overlooked his federal claim. A\nnonexhaustive list of factors, we are told, may bear on the\nanalysis: state-court opinion-writing practices, ante, at 8,\n9; state-law precedents and whether and how they incor-\nporate federal law, ante, at 8; substantiality of the federal\n2                   JOHNSON v.

Only after conducting its\nown detective work does the Court conclude that the fed-\neral claim was not overlooked in this case.\n   This complex exercise is unnecessary. A judgment that\ndenies relief necessarily denies\u2014and thus adjudicates\u2014all\nthe claims a petitioner has raised. See 1 H.

Perhaps not, but it nonetheless may have\nbeen rejected \u201con the merits.\u201d That phrase does not sug-\ngest a line between a considered rejection of a claim and\nan unconsidered, inadequately considered, or inadvertent\nrejection. Rather, it refers to a \u201cdetermination that there\nexist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner\u201d to relief\nunder his claim, as contrasted with a \u201cdenial for such rea-\nsons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-\nof-limitations bar.\u201d Gonzalez v.

An \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d is \u201cbest\nunderstood by stating what it is not: it is not a resolution\nof a claim on procedural grounds.\u201d Muth v. Frank, 412\nF. 3d 808, 815 (CA7 2005). And, as we have affirmed and\nreaffirmed recently, where a claim has been denied, but it\nis unclear from the record whether the denial was on the\nmerits or on another basis, we presume the former. Har-\nrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u2013\n10) (citing Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 265 (1989)); see\nalso Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732\u2013733 (1991).\n   We apply a presumption of merits determination in that\nsense not just with respect to \u00a72254(d) but for other pur-\nposes as well. We have long applied it, for example, in\ndetermining whether a claim is barred by res judicata:\n    \u201cOrdinarily, such a question is answered by a mere\n    inspection of the decree\u2014the presumption being that\n    a dismissal in equity, without qualifying words, is a\n    final decision on the merits. That presumption of fi-\n    nality . . . disappears whenever the record shows that\n    the court did not pass upon the merits but dismissed\n    the bill because of a want of jurisdiction, for want of\n    parties, because the suit was brought prematurely,\n    because the plaintiff had a right to file a subsequent\n    bill on the same subject-matter, or on any other\n    ground not going to the merits.\u201d Swift v. McPherson,\n    232 U. S. 51, 55\u201356 (1914) (emphasis added); see also\n    Hubbell v. United States, 171 U. S. 203, 207 (1898);\n    Durant v. Essex Co., 7 Wall. 107, 109 (1868).\n  We also apply a presumption of merits determination in\nthe sense I have described for purposes of 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71257, which imposes a federal-question requirement as a\ncondition of this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Michigan\nv. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983). Indeed, the\napplication of the presumption in direct-review cases was\nthe genesis of the presumption in federal habeas cases.\n4                   JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThe condition for federal habeas\u2014that the federal ques-\ntion must have been addressed on the merits by the state\ncourts\u2014did not originate with the enactment of the Anti-\nterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in 1996, but\nwas established as early as 1977 in Wainwright v. Sykes,\n433 U. S. 72, 81, 86\u201387. We described the assessment\nof whether that requirement was met as presenting \u201cthe\nsame problem of ambiguity that this Court resolved in\nMichigan v. Long.\u201d Harris, 489 U. S., at 262. And indeed,\nwe described the habeas requirement as an application of\nthe \u201cadequate and independent state ground doctrine,\u201d\nwhich inquires whether a \u201cfinding of procedural default\nwill bar federal habeas review.\u201d Ibid. It is of course un-\nthinkable that a state-court resolution of a federal ques-\ntion will escape our review under \u00a71257 if it is inadvertent\nrather than intentional.\n   Given this background, there is no reason to believe that\nAEDPA established a new and peculiar regime in which\nthe federal habeas court must make one assessment of\nwhether the federal question has been decided \u201con the\nmerits\u201d for purposes of determining its authority to review\nthe question (a Long assessment which counts, as \u00a71257\ncases count, inadvertent resolution of a federal question);\nand then must proceed to a different assessment of \u201con the\nmerits\u201d (one that does not count inadvertent resolution)\nfor purposes of determining whether deference to the\nstate-court judgment is required.\n   But, it will be argued, how can a court \u201cdefer\u201d to a state-\ncourt determination that was in fact never made? Must\nnot one first be sure it exists before one can accord it\nrespect? The answer is no; according respect only to de-\nterminations that have for-sure been made is demonstra-\nbly not the scheme that AEDPA envisions. Federal ha-\nbeas courts defer to state determinations that may in fact\nnever have been made whenever they find a summary,\nunexplained rejection of a federal claim to be sustainable\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The validating basis that the\nfederal habeas court posits need not have been the one\nthat the state court actually relied upon; the state court\nmay well have applied a theory that was flat-out wrong,\nand may not have made the subsidiary determinations\n(including factual assessments) necessary to support the\ncorrect theory. That does not matter. For what is accorded\ndeference is not the state court\u2019s reasoning but the state\ncourt\u2019s judgment, which is presumed to be supported by\nwhatever valid support was available. See Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\u201cUnder \u00a72254(d) a habeas\ncourt must determine what arguments or theories sup-\nported or, as here, could have supported, the state court\u2019s\ndecision\u201d). Indeed, the deference with regard to the basis\nof decision is much more \u201cblind\u201d than the deference I\nassert is necessary in the present case. I demand a state-\ncourt statement (contained in the unqualified terms of its\njudgment) that it has rejected the federal claim; I sim-\nply refuse to question the veracity of that statement. By\ncontrast, no statement is ever even required that the state\ncourt relied upon the theory of federal law that the habeas\ncourt finds validating.\n   I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by its novel\ninterpretation of \u201con the merits\u201d for purposes of \u00a72254(d).\nImagine that the state court formulated its judgment as\nfollows: \u201cAll claims raised by the defendant have been\nconsidered and denied.\u201d I cannot believe that the Court\nwould require federal courts to test the veracity of that\nstatement. Yet, as we have described, that is precisely\nwhat an (unadorned) judgment denying relief already\nconveys. Although the Court acknowledges that \u201c \u2018[w]e\nhave no power to tell state courts how they must write\ntheir opinions,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9, its analysis would turn solely\non how the order of judgment is styled.\n   Resolution of this case is direct: Respondent\u2019s claim was\n6                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits,\u201d because the state court ren-\ndered a judgment rejecting all her claims, and the judg-\nment gave no indication (such as a statement that it was\n\u201cwithout prejudice\u201d) that it was based on a procedural or\nother nonmerits ground.\n   The Court\u2019s novel resolution of the \u201con the merits\u201d ques-\ntion produces a clear enough answer in this case. The\nweight of the evidence demonstrated that it was \u201cexceed-\ningly unlikely\u201d that the state court overlooked the federal\nclaim. Ante, at 16. But such ready resolution will not be\ncommonplace. Consider another case, where the federal\nand state claims are not related, where there is no rele-\nvant state precedent referring to federal law, where state\nlaw might be interpreted as less defendant-friendly than\nthe federal standard, or where a confluence of such factors\nexists. The answer to whether the federal claim has been\n\u201cevaluated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the\nmatter\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. One thing, however, is cer-\ntain: The Court\u2019s case-by-case approach will guarantee\nprotracted litigation over whether a state-court judge was\naware of a claim on the day he rejected it.\n   The Court tells us not to worry about a flood of liti-\ngation, because the Courts of Appeals have previously al-\nlowed arguments from petitioners that the state courts\noverlooked their federal claims. Ante, at 13, and n. 4\n(citing cases). But many of those cases applied a much\nsimpler (and even less justifiable) test than the one\nadopted today: if the federal claim was not addressed in\nthe opinion, then it was not adjudicated on the merits. See,\ne.g., Lyell v. Renico, 470 F. 3d 1177, 1181\u20131182 (CA6\n2006); Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F. 3d 39, 47 (CA1 2001).\nAnd even those courts that attempted to \u201cdivin[e] the\nthought processes of\u201d the judge limited their inquiry to\n\u201cwhat a state court has said.\u201d Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F.\n3d 458, 461 (CA8 2004) (emphasis added); see also, e.g.,\nChadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 606 (CA3 2002). By\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Are federal habeas courts now to consider evidence\nrelevant to the internal deliberations of the state judici-\nary? Can a petitioner introduce testimony showing that\nstate-court judges\u2014because of time constraints, heavy\ncaseloads, or other reasons\u2014fail to read the briefs but\nleave that to their assistants, whose recommendations\nthey rarely reject? Or testimony showing that, typically,\nonly one judge on the state-court appellate panel reads the\nbriefs and considers all the claims, and the others simply\njoin the drafted order? Has there been an \u201cadjudication\non the merits\u201d then? Future litigation will supply the\nanswers.\n   For these reasons, I do not join the opinion of the Court\nand concur only in the judgment.\n",

C. \u00a72254(d), unless the claim\u2019s adjudication re-\n  sulted in a decision that was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasona-\n  ble application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n  [this] Court,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1), or \u201cbased on an unreasonable determina-\n  tion of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\n  proceeding,\u201d \u00a72254(d)(2).\n     A California jury convicted respondent Williams of first-degree\n  murder. On direct appeal to the California Court of Appeal, she\n  claimed that the trial court\u2019s questioning and dismissal of a juror\n  during deliberations violated both the Sixth Amendment and Cali-\n  fornia law. In holding that the juror had been properly dismissed for\n  bias, the California Court of Appeal quoted the definition of \u201cimpar-\n  tiality\u201d from United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145\u2013146, but it did\n  not expressly acknowledge that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment\n  issue. The State Supreme Court remanded for further consideration\n  in light of its intervening Cleveland decision, which held that a trial\n  court abused its discretion by dismissing for failure to deliberate a ju-\n  ror who appeared to disagree with the rest of the jury about the evi-\n  dence. Reaffirming its prior decision on remand, the State Court of\n  Appeal discussed Cleveland, again quoted Wood, and failed to ex-\n  pressly acknowledge that Williams had raised a federal claim.\n     When Williams later sought federal habeas relief, the District\n  Court applied \u00a72254\u2019s deferential standard of review for claims adju-\n  dicated on the merits and denied relief. But the Ninth Circuit con-\n  cluded that the State Court of Appeal had not considered Williams\u2019\n2                       JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    Sixth Amendment claim. The court then reviewed that claim de novo\n    and held that the questioning and dismissal of the juror violated the\n    Sixth Amendment.\nHeld:\n    1. For purposes of \u00a72254(d), when a state court rules against a de-\n fendant in an opinion that rejects some of the defendant\u2019s claims but\n does not expressly address a federal claim, a federal habeas court\n must presume, subject to rebuttal, that the federal claim was adjudi-\n cated on the merits. Pp. 7\u201313.\n       (a) This conclusion follows logically from Harrington v. Richter,\n 562 U. S. ___. There, the Court held that when a state court issues\n an order that summarily rejects without discussion all the claims\n raised by a defendant, including a federal claim that the defendant\n subsequently presses in federal habeas, the federal habeas court\n must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits.\n Though Richter concerned a state-court order that did not address\n any of the defendant\u2019s claims, there is no sound reason not to apply\n its presumption when a state-court opinion addresses some but not\n all of those claims. Federal habeas courts should not assume that\n any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked because state\n courts do not uniformly discuss separately every claim referenced by\n a defendant. In fact, they frequently take a different course. They\n may view a line of state precedent as fully incorporating a related\n federal constitutional right, may not regard a fleeting reference to a\n provision of the Federal Constitution or federal precedent as suffi-\n cient to raise a federal claim, or may simply regard a claim as too in-\n substantial to merit discussion. Pp. 7\u221210.\n       (b) Petitioner\u2019s argument for an irrebuttable presumption goes\n too far. Certainly, if a state standard subsumes the federal standard,\n the federal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated on the\n merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8. But where, e.g., the state\n standard is less protective or the federal precedent was mentioned in\n passing, the presumption may be rebutted\u2014either by a habeas peti-\n tioner (to show that the federal court should consider the claim de\n novo) or by the State (to show that the federal claim should be re-\n garded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman v. Thompson, 501\n U. S. 722, 739. An irrebuttable presumption that state courts never\n overlook federal claims would sometimes be wrong. It would also im-\n properly excise \u00a72254(d)\u2019s on-the-merits requirement, for a claim that\n is rejected as a result of sheer inadvertence has not been evaluated\n on the merits. The experience of the lower federal courts shows that\n allowing federal habeas petitioners to rebut the presumption will not\n prompt an unduly burdensome flood of litigation.

Several facts\n  lead to that conclusion. Most important is that the court discussed\n  Cleveland, a State Supreme Court case that in turn examined three\n  Federal Court of Appeals cases concerning the Sixth Amendment im-\n  plications of discharging holdout jurors. Though Cleveland refused to\n  follow those cases, the views of the federal courts of appeals do not\n  bind a State Supreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional\n  question. Regardless of whether a California court would consider\n  Williams\u2019 state-law and Sixth Amendment claims to be coextensive,\n  their similarity makes it unlikely that the State Court of Appeal de-\n  cided one while overlooking the other. The State Court of Appeal\u2019s\n  quotation of Wood, supra, at 145\u2212146, further confirms that it was\n  well aware that the juror\u2019s questioning and dismissal implicated fed-\n  eral law. Williams\u2019 litigation strategy also supports this result. She\n  treated her state and federal claims as interchangeable, so it is not\n  surprising that the state courts did as well. Notably, Williams nei-\n  ther petitioned the State Court of Appeal for rehearing nor argued in\n  subsequent state and federal proceedings that the state court had\n  failed to adjudicate her Sixth Amendment claim on the merits.\n  Pp. 13\u221216.\n646 F. 3d 626, reversed and remanded.\n\n  ALITO, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C.

Specifically, if a\nclaim has been \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court,\u201d\na federal habeas court may not grant relief unless \u201cthe\nadjudication of the claim\u2014\n       \u201c(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n    involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab-\n    lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n    Court of the United States; or\n       \u201c(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un-\n    reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n    evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d\n    Ibid.\n  Because the requirements of \u00a72254(d) are difficult to\nmeet, it is important whether a federal claim was \u201cadjudi-\ncated on the merits in State court,\u201d and this case requires\nus to ascertain the meaning of the adjudication-on-the\n2                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmerits requirement. This issue arises when a defendant\nconvicted in state court attempts to raise a federal claim,\neither on direct appeal or in a collateral state proceeding,\nand a state court rules against the defendant and issues\nan opinion that addresses some issues but does not ex-\npressly address the federal claim in question. If this\ndefendant then raises the same claim in a federal habeas\nproceeding, should the federal court regard the claim as\nhaving been adjudicated on the merits by the state court\nand apply deference under \u00a72254(d)? Or may the federal\ncourt assume that the state court simply overlooked the\nfederal claim and proceed to adjudicate the claim de novo,\nthe course taken by the Court of Appeals in the case at\nhand?\n  We believe that the answer to this question follows\nlogically from our decision in Harrington v. Richter, 562\nU. S. ___ (2011). In that case, we held that, when a state\ncourt issues an order that summarily rejects without\ndiscussion all the claims raised by a defendant, including\na federal claim that the defendant subsequently presses in\na federal habeas proceeding, the federal habeas court must\npresume (subject to rebuttal) that the federal claim was\nadjudicated on the merits. We see no reason why this\nsame rule should not apply when the state court addresses\nsome of the claims raised by a defendant but not a claim\nthat is later raised in a federal habeas proceeding.\n  Applying this rule in the present case, we hold that the\nfederal claim at issue here (a Sixth Amendment jury trial\nclaim) must be presumed to have been adjudicated on the\nmerits by the California courts, that this presumption was\nnot adequately rebutted, that the restrictive standard of\nreview set out in \u00a72254(d)(2) consequently applies, and\nthat under that standard respondent is not entitled to\nhabeas relief. We therefore reverse the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals.\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

They stopped at a\nliquor store in Long Beach, and while Williams waited in\nthe getaway car, her friends stole money from the cash\nregister and fatally shot the store\u2019s owner. Williams then\ndrove one of her friends away, and the other fled on foot.\nWilliams avoided capture for five years but was ultimately\napprehended and charged with first-degree murder.\n   At trial, Williams admitted that she had served as the\ngetaway driver but claimed that she did not know that her\nfriends were going to rob the liquor store at the particular\ntime in question. Instead, she contended that the three\nfriends had agreed only that they would \u201ccase\u201d the store\nand would possibly return later that evening to rob it. The\nState countered that, regardless of whether Williams\nknew precisely when and where the robbery was to take\nplace, she had agreed to help commit a robbery and that\nthis was sufficient to provide the predicate for felony\nmurder under California law.\n   After deliberating for about three hours, the jury fore-\nman sent the judge two notes.

WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe judge told the jury that the answer to the question in\nthe first note was \u201cno.\u201d Id., at 1249. Then, over Williams\u2019\nobjection, the judge briefly questioned the foreman outside\nthe presence of the rest of the jury about the second note.\nThe foreman said that he thought the judge\u2019s answer to\nthe first note might resolve the problem, and the judge\ninstructed the jury to resume its deliberations.\n   The next morning, once again over Williams\u2019 objection,\nthe judge decided to inquire further about the foreman\u2019s\nsecond note. On questioning by the judge and lawyers for\nboth parties, the foreman testified that Juror 6 had\nbrought up past instances of jury nullification. The fore-\nman also expressed doubt about whether Juror 6 was\nwilling to apply the felony-murder rule. The trial judge\nthen ordered questioning of Juror 6, who first denied and\nthen admitted bringing up instances of nullification.\nJuror 6 also testified that this was a serious case and that\nhe would vote to convict only if he was \u201cvery convinced . . .\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at 1280. He later clari-\nfied that in his view \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\u201d and \u201cvery convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d\nmeant the same thing. Id., at 1281. After taking testi-\nmony from the remaining jurors, who corroborated the\nforeman\u2019s testimony to varying degrees, the trial judge dis-\nmissed Juror 6 for bias. With an alternate juror in place,\nthe jury convicted Williams of first-degree murder.\n                             B\n  On appeal to the California Court of Appeal, Williams\nargued, among other things, that the discharge of Juror 6\nviolated both the Sixth Amendment and the California\nPenal Code, which allows a California trial judge to dis-\nmiss a juror who \u201cupon . . . good cause shown to the court\nis found to be unable to perform his or her duty.\u201d Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a71089 (West 2004).

People v. Taylor, No. B137365 (Mar. 27,\n2001). The court held that Juror 6 had been properly\ndismissed for bias and quoted this Court\u2019s definition of\n\u201cimpartiality\u201d in United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123,\n145\u2013146 (1936). But despite its extended discussion of\nJuror 6\u2019s dismissal and the questioning that preceded it,\nthe California Court of Appeal never expressly acknowl-\nedged that it was deciding a Sixth Amendment issue.\n   Williams petitioned the California Supreme Court for\nreview, and while her petition was pending, that court\ndecided People v.

The California Supreme Court granted Wil-\nliams\u2019 petition for review and remanded her case for fur-\nther consideration in light of this intervening authority.\nPeople v. Taylor, No. S097387 (July 11, 2001).\n   On remand, the California Court of Appeal issued a\nrevised opinion holding that the trial court had not abused\nits discretion by questioning the jury and dismissing Juror\n6. Williams argued that Juror 6\u2014like the holdout juror in\nCleveland\u2014was dismissed because he was uncooperative\nwith other jurors who did not share his view of the evi-\ndence. But the California Court of Appeal disagreed,\nexplaining that Williams\u2019 argument \u201cnot only misstate[d]\nthe evidence,\u201d but also \u201cignore[d] the trial court\u2019s explana-\ntion that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had\nshown himself to be biased, not because he was failing to\ndeliberate or engaging in juror nullification.\u201d People v.\nTaylor, No. B137365 (Jan. 18, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n6                     JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n105a. As in its earlier opinion, the California Court of\nAppeal quoted our definition of juror bias in Wood, but the\ncourt did not expressly acknowledge that Williams had\ninvoked a federal basis for her argument. Despite that\nomission, however, Williams did not seek rehearing or other-\nwise suggest that the court had overlooked her federal\nclaim. Instead, she filed another petition for review in\nthe California Supreme Court, but this time that court\ndenied relief in a one-sentence order. People v. Taylor, No.\nS104661 (Apr. 10, 2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a.\n   Williams sought but failed to obtain relief through state\nhabeas proceedings, and she then filed a federal habeas\npetition under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District Court ap-\nplied AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review for claims\npreviously adjudicated on the merits and denied relief.\nWilliams v. Mitchell, No. 03\u20132691 (CD Cal., May 30,\n2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a. In so holding, the Dis-\ntrict Court adopted a Magistrate Judge\u2019s finding that the\nevidence \u201camply support[ed] the trial judge\u2019s determina-\ntion that good cause existed for the discharge of Juror 6.\u201d\nWilliams v. Mitchell, No. 03\u20132691 (CD Cal., Mar. 19,\n2007), id., at 70a.\n   The Ninth Circuit reversed. Unlike the District Court,\nthe Ninth Circuit declined to apply the deferential stand-\nard of review contained in \u00a72254(d). The Ninth Circuit\ntook this approach because it thought it \u201cobvious\u201d that the\nState Court of Appeal had \u201coverlooked or disregarded\u201d\nWilliams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim.1 Williams v.

Reviewing Williams\u2019 Sixth\nAmendment claim de novo, the Ninth Circuit applied its\nown precedent and held that the questioning and dismis-\nsal of Juror 6 violated the Sixth Amendment. 646 F. 3d, at\n646\u2013647. We granted the warden\u2019s petition for a writ of\ncertiorari, 565 U.

S. C.\n\u00a72254(d). In Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), we\nheld that \u00a72254(d) \u201cdoes not require a state court to give\nreasons before its decision can be deemed to have been\n\u2018adjudicated on the merits.\u2019 \u201d       Rather, we explained,\n\u201c[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court\nand the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed\nthat the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in\nthe absence of any indication or state-law procedural\nprinciples to the contrary.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n  Our reasoning in Richter points clearly to the answer to\nthe question presented in the case at hand. Although\nRichter itself concerned a state-court order that did not\naddress any of the defendant\u2019s claims, we see no reason\nwhy the Richter presumption should not also apply when a\nstate-court opinion addresses some but not all of a defend-\nant\u2019s claims. There would be a reason for drawing a dis-\ntinction between these two situations if opinions issued by\nstate appellate courts always separately addressed every\n8                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsingle claim that is mentioned in a defendant\u2019s papers. If\nthere were such a uniform practice, then federal habeas\ncourts could assume that any unaddressed federal claim\nwas simply overlooked.\n   No such assumption is warranted, however, because it is\nnot the uniform practice of busy state courts to discuss\nseparately every single claim to which a defendant makes\neven a passing reference. On the contrary, there are\nseveral situations in which state courts frequently take a\ndifferent course.\n   First, there are circumstances in which a line of state\nprecedent is viewed as fully incorporating a related federal\nconstitutional right. In California, for example, the state\nconstitutional right to be present at trial \u201c \u2018is generally\ncoextensive with\u2019 \u201d the protections of the Federal Constitu-\ntion. People v.

In this situa-\ntion, a state appellate court may regard its discussion of\nthe state precedent as sufficient to cover a claim based on\nthe related federal right.\n   Second, a state court may not regard a fleeting reference\nto a provision of the Federal Constitution or federal prece-\ndent as sufficient to raise a separate federal claim.

State appellate courts are entitled to follow the\nsame practice.\n   Third, there are instances in which a state court may\nsimply regard a claim as too insubstantial to merit discus-\nsion. Indeed, the California Court of Appeal has expressly\nstated that it has no obligation to address claims that lack\narguable merit. See People v.

When a state court rejects a federal\nclaim without expressly addressing that claim, a federal\nhabeas court must presume that the federal claim was\nadjudicated on the merits\u2014but that presumption can in\nsome limited circumstances be rebutted.\n                              B\n   Not satisfied with a strong but rebuttable presumption,\npetitioner urges us to make the presumption irrebuttable.\nSpecifically, petitioner contends that a state court must be\nregarded as having adjudicated a federal claim on the\nmerits if the state court addressed \u201cthe substance of [an]\nasserted trial error.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 27.

To be sure, if the state-law\nrule subsumes the federal standard\u2014that is, if it is\nat least as protective as the federal standard\u2014then the\nfederal claim may be regarded as having been adjudicated\non the merits. See Early v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002)\n(per curiam). But what if, for example, in at least some\ncircumstances the state standard is less protective? Or\nwhat if the state standard is quite different from the\nfederal standard, and the defendant\u2019s papers made no\neffort to develop the basis for the federal claim? What if a\nprovision of the Federal Constitution or a federal prece-\ndent was simply mentioned in passing in a footnote or was\nburied in a string cite? In such circumstances, the pre-\nsumption that the federal claim was adjudicated on the\nmerits may be rebutted\u2014either by the habeas petitioner\n(for the purpose of showing that the claim should be con-\nsidered by the federal court de novo) or by the State (for\nthe purpose of showing that the federal claim should be\nregarded as procedurally defaulted). See Coleman, supra,\nat 739 (rebuttable presumption of no independent and\nadequate state ground applies so long as \u201cit fairly appears\nthat a state court judgment rested primarily on federal\nlaw or was interwoven with federal law\u201d). Thus, while the\nRichter presumption is a strong one that may be rebutted\nonly in unusual circumstances, it is not irrebuttable.3 \u201cPer\nse rules should not be applied . . . in situations where the\ngeneralization is incorrect as an empirical matter,\u201d Cole-\nman, 501 U.

Reese, 541 U. S. 27, 29 (2004), the Richter presumption is fully\nrebutted.\n12                 JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat state courts never overlook federal claims would\noccasionally miss the mark.\n   The language of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d) makes it clear that\nthis provision applies only when a federal claim was \u201cad-\njudicated on the merits in State court.\u201d A judgment is\nnormally said to have been rendered \u201con the merits\u201d only\nif it was \u201cdelivered after the court . . . heard and evaluated\nthe evidence and the parties\u2019 substantive arguments.\u201d\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1199 (9th ed. 2009) (emphasis\nadded). And as used in this context, the word \u201cmerits\u201d is\ndefined as \u201c[t]he intrinsic rights and wrongs of a case as\ndetermined by matters of substance, in distinction from\nmatters of form.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1540 (2d ed. 1954) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., 9 Ox-\nford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cthe intrinsic\n\u2018rights and wrongs\u2019 of the matter, in contradistinction to\nextraneous points such as the competence of the tribunal\nor the like\u201d (emphasis added)); Random House Dictionary\nof the English Language 897 (1967) (\u201cthe intrinsic right\nand wrong of a matter, as a law case, unobscured by pro-\ncedural details, technicalities, personal feelings, etc.\u201d\n(emphasis added)). If a federal claim is rejected as a\nresult of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evaluated\nbased on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA is surely correct that such claims have\nbeen adjudicated and present federal questions we may\nreview, post, at 3\u20134, but it does not follow that they have\nbeen adjudicated \u201con the merits.\u201d By having us neverthe-\nless apply AEDPA\u2019s deferential standard of review in such\ncases, petitioner\u2019s argument would improperly excise\n\u00a72254(d)\u2019s on-the-merits requirement.\n   Nor does petitioner\u2019s preferred approach follow inexora-\nbly from AEDPA\u2019s deferential architecture. Even while\nleaving \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for adjudicating federal\nclaims to the States, Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.

Quarterman, 551 U. S. 930,\n953 (2007). When the evidence leads very clearly to the\nconclusion that a federal claim was inadvertently over-\nlooked in state court, \u00a72254(d) entitles the prisoner to an\nunencumbered opportunity to make his case before a fed-\neral judge.\n  We are not persuaded that applying a rebuttable pre-\nsumption in this context will be unduly burdensome for\nfederal courts. Before Richter, every Court of Appeals to\nconsider the issue allowed a prisoner to argue that a state\ncourt had overlooked his federal claim.4 That approach\ndid not prompt an unmanageable flood of litigation, and\nwe see no reason to fear that it will do so now.\n                             III\n   Applying the presumption of merits adjudication to the\nfacts of this case, we hold that the Ninth Circuit erred by\nfinding that the California Court of Appeal overlooked\nWilliams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim.

The\nCleveland court acknowledged \u201c[t]he need to protect the\nsanctity of jury deliberations,\u201d id., at 476, 21 P. 3d, at\n1231, and included a lengthy discussion of three Federal\nCourt of Appeals cases that it said had \u201cconsidered these\nissues in depth,\u201d id., at 480\u2013484, 21 P. 3d, at 1234\u20131237.\nThose three cases\u2014United States v. Symington, 195 F. 3d\n1080 (CA9 1999), United States v. Thomas, 116 F. 3d 606\n(CA2 1997), and United States v. Brown, 823 F. 2d 591\n(CADC 1987)\u2014concern the discharge of holdout jurors in\nfederal court. Each case discusses the Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial and concludes that a trial court should\nnot inquire further if it appears that there is \u201c \u2018any reason-\nable possibility that the impetus for a juror\u2019s dismissal\nstems from the juror\u2019s views on the merits of the case.\u2019 \u201d\nCleveland, supra, at 484, 21 P. 3d, at 1237 (quoting Sym-\nington, supra, at 1087); see also Thomas, supra, at 621\u2013\n622; Brown, supra, at 596. Though the Cleveland court\nfound much to praise in these decisions, it expressly de-\nclined to follow them on this point. 25 Cal. 4th, at 483\u2013\n484, 21 P. 3d, at 1236\u20131237.\n    Cleveland did not expressly purport to decide a federal\nconstitutional question, but its discussion of Symington,\nThomas, and Brown shows that the California Supreme\nCourt understood itself to be deciding a question with\nfederal constitutional dimensions. See 25 Cal. 4th, at 487,\n21 P. 3d, at 1239 (Werdegar, J., concurring) (emphasizing\nimportance of careful appellate review in juror discharge\ncases in light of the \u201cconstitutional dimension to the prob-\nlem\u201d). Indeed, it is difficult to imagine the California\nSupreme Court announcing an interpretation of Cal. Penal\nCode Ann. \u00a71089 that it believed to be less protective than\nthe Sixth Amendment, as any such interpretation would\nprovide no guidance to state trial judges bound to follow\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nboth state and federal law.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion to the contrary rested\non the fact that Cleveland refused to follow Symington,\nBrown, and Thomas. 646 F. 3d, at 640. But the views of\nthe federal courts of appeals do not bind the California\nSupreme Court when it decides a federal constitutional\nquestion, and disagreeing with the lower federal courts is\nnot the same as ignoring federal law. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s\napparent assumption that the California Supreme Court\ncould not refuse to follow federal court of appeals prece-\ndent without disregarding the Federal Constitution would\nundo \u00a72254(d)\u2019s \u201ccontrary to\u201d provision, which requires\ndeference unless a state court fails to follow Supreme\nCourt precedent. 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   Regardless of whether a California court would consider\nWilliams\u2019 \u00a71089 and Sixth Amendment claims to be per-\nfectly coextensive, the fact that these claims are so similar\nmakes it unlikely that the California Court of Appeal\ndecided one while overlooking the other. Indeed, it is dif-\nficult to imagine any panel of appellate judges reading\nCleveland and passing on the propriety of dismissing a\nholdout juror under \u00a71089 without realizing that such\nsituations also bear on the federal constitutional right to a\nfair trial. The California Court of Appeal\u2019s quotation of\nour definition of \u201cimpartiality\u201d from Wood, 299 U. S., at\n145\u2013146, points to the same conclusion, confirming that\nthe state court was well aware that the questioning and\ndismissal of Juror 6 implicated both state and federal law.\n   Williams\u2019 litigation strategy supports the same result.\nThroughout her state proceedings, Williams treated her\nstate and federal claims as interchangeable, and it is\nhardly surprising that the state courts did so as well. See\nBrief for Appellant in No. B137365 (Cal. App.), App. 29\n(citing \u00a71089 precedent and concluding that Williams \u201cwas\naccordingly denied her Sixth Amendment right to a unan-\nimous jury\u201d). After the California Court of Appeal ren-\n16                 JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndered its decision, Williams neither petitioned that court\nfor rehearing nor argued in the subsequent state and\nfederal proceedings that the state court had failed to\nadjudicate her Sixth Amendment claim on the merits. The\npossibility that the California Court of Appeal had simply\noverlooked Williams\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim apparently\ndid not occur to anyone until that issue was raised by two\njudges during the oral argument in the Ninth Circuit. See\n646 F. 3d, at 638, n. 7. Williams presumably knows her\ncase better than anyone else, and the fact that she does\nnot appear to have thought that there was an oversight\nmakes such a mistake most improbable.\n  We think it exceedingly unlikely that the California\nCourt of Appeal overlooked Williams\u2019 federal claim, and\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment to the contrary is reversed.\nThe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

TARA SHENEVA WILLIAMS \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                      [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\n  I agree with the Court\u2019s rejection of the proposition that\na judgment denying a federal claim is irrebuttably pre-\nsumed to have been \u201cadjudicated on the merits\u201d within the\nmeaning of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d). I disagree, however, that\none of the grounds on which the rebuttal may rely is that\nthe federal claim was \u201cinadvertently overlooked.\u201d Ante,\nat 13. In my view the rebuttal must consist of a show-\ning, based on the explicit text of the court\u2019s order, or upon\nstandard practice and understanding in the jurisdiction\nwith regard to the meaning of an ambiguous text, that the\njudgment did not purport to decide the federal question.\n\u201cDecided after due consideration\u201d is not, and has never\nbeen, the meaning of the legal term of art \u201cdecided on the\nmerits,\u201d and giving it that meaning burdens our lower\ncourts with an unusual subjective inquiry that demeans\nstate courts and will be a fertile source of litigation and\ndelay.\n  In the Court\u2019s view, a habeas petitioner receives de novo\nreview if he can prove that the state court, although ad-\ndressing his state claim, overlooked his federal claim. A\nnonexhaustive list of factors, we are told, may bear on the\nanalysis: state-court opinion-writing practices, ante, at 8,\n9; state-law precedents and whether and how they incor-\nporate federal law, ante, at 8; substantiality of the federal\n2                   JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nclaim, ante, at 9; citations to federal cases in state-court\nopinions (or citations to state cases that contain citations\nto federal cases), ante, at 13\u201314; the degree of similarity\nbetween the federal and state claim, ante, at 15; a peti-\ntioner\u2019s \u201clitigation strategy,\u201d ante, at 15\u201316; and other\nclues that may possibly illuminate the inner thought\nprocesses of a state-court judge. Only after conducting its\nown detective work does the Court conclude that the fed-\neral claim was not overlooked in this case.\n   This complex exercise is unnecessary. A judgment that\ndenies relief necessarily denies\u2014and thus adjudicates\u2014all\nthe claims a petitioner has raised. See 1 H. Black, Law of\nJudgments \u00a71, p. 2 (2d ed. 1902) (\u201c[T]he judgment neces-\nsarily affirms, or else denies, that [an alleged] duty or . . .\nliability rests upon the person against whom the aid of the\nlaw is invoked\u201d); id., \u00a724, at 37. The judgment itself\ngives conclusive expression that the claims have been con-\nsidered and rejected\u2014whatever the individual judge\nmight have been pondering (or not pondering). At common\nlaw the formal language traditionally preceding the an-\nnouncement of a court\u2019s judgment was \u201cconsideratum est\nper curiam\u201d (\u201cIt is considered by the court\u201d). See Black\u2019s\nLaw Dictionary 349\u2013350 (9th ed. 2009); 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law\nDictionary 619 (8th ed. 1914).\n   The Court maintains that \u201c[i]f a federal claim is rejected\nas a result of sheer inadvertence, it has not been evalu-\nated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the matter,\u201d\nante, at 12. Perhaps not, but it nonetheless may have\nbeen rejected \u201con the merits.\u201d That phrase does not sug-\ngest a line between a considered rejection of a claim and\nan unconsidered, inadequately considered, or inadvertent\nrejection. Rather, it refers to a \u201cdetermination that there\nexist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner\u201d to relief\nunder his claim, as contrasted with a \u201cdenial for such rea-\nsons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-\nof-limitations bar.\u201d Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U. S. 524,\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n532, n. 4 (2005). An \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d is \u201cbest\nunderstood by stating what it is not: it is not a resolution\nof a claim on procedural grounds.\u201d Muth v. Frank, 412\nF. 3d 808, 815 (CA7 2005). And, as we have affirmed and\nreaffirmed recently, where a claim has been denied, but it\nis unclear from the record whether the denial was on the\nmerits or on another basis, we presume the former. Har-\nrington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u2013\n10) (citing Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 265 (1989)); see\nalso Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732\u2013733 (1991).\n   We apply a presumption of merits determination in that\nsense not just with respect to \u00a72254(d) but for other pur-\nposes as well. We have long applied it, for example, in\ndetermining whether a claim is barred by res judicata:\n    \u201cOrdinarily, such a question is answered by a mere\n    inspection of the decree\u2014the presumption being that\n    a dismissal in equity, without qualifying words, is a\n    final decision on the merits. That presumption of fi-\n    nality . . . disappears whenever the record shows that\n    the court did not pass upon the merits but dismissed\n    the bill because of a want of jurisdiction, for want of\n    parties, because the suit was brought prematurely,\n    because the plaintiff had a right to file a subsequent\n    bill on the same subject-matter, or on any other\n    ground not going to the merits.\u201d Swift v.

S. C.\n\u00a71257, which imposes a federal-question requirement as a\ncondition of this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Michigan\nv. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040\u20131041 (1983). Indeed, the\napplication of the presumption in direct-review cases was\nthe genesis of the presumption in federal habeas cases.\n4                   JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\nThe condition for federal habeas\u2014that the federal ques-\ntion must have been addressed on the merits by the state\ncourts\u2014did not originate with the enactment of the Anti-\nterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in 1996, but\nwas established as early as 1977 in Wainwright v. Sykes,\n433 U. S. 72, 81, 86\u201387. We described the assessment\nof whether that requirement was met as presenting \u201cthe\nsame problem of ambiguity that this Court resolved in\nMichigan v. Long.\u201d Harris, 489 U. S., at 262. And indeed,\nwe described the habeas requirement as an application of\nthe \u201cadequate and independent state ground doctrine,\u201d\nwhich inquires whether a \u201cfinding of procedural default\nwill bar federal habeas review.\u201d Ibid. It is of course un-\nthinkable that a state-court resolution of a federal ques-\ntion will escape our review under \u00a71257 if it is inadvertent\nrather than intentional.\n   Given this background, there is no reason to believe that\nAEDPA established a new and peculiar regime in which\nthe federal habeas court must make one assessment of\nwhether the federal question has been decided \u201con the\nmerits\u201d for purposes of determining its authority to review\nthe question (a Long assessment which counts, as \u00a71257\ncases count, inadvertent resolution of a federal question);\nand then must proceed to a different assessment of \u201con the\nmerits\u201d (one that does not count inadvertent resolution)\nfor purposes of determining whether deference to the\nstate-court judgment is required.\n   But, it will be argued, how can a court \u201cdefer\u201d to a state-\ncourt determination that was in fact never made? Must\nnot one first be sure it exists before one can accord it\nrespect? The answer is no; according respect only to de-\nterminations that have for-sure been made is demonstra-\nbly not the scheme that AEDPA envisions. Federal ha-\nbeas courts defer to state determinations that may in fact\nnever have been made whenever they find a summary,\nunexplained rejection of a federal claim to be sustainable\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n(e.g., not contrary to clearly established federal law as\ndetermined by this Court). The validating basis that the\nfederal habeas court posits need not have been the one\nthat the state court actually relied upon; the state court\nmay well have applied a theory that was flat-out wrong,\nand may not have made the subsidiary determinations\n(including factual assessments) necessary to support the\ncorrect theory. That does not matter. For what is accorded\ndeference is not the state court\u2019s reasoning but the state\ncourt\u2019s judgment, which is presumed to be supported by\nwhatever valid support was available. See Harrington,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\u201cUnder \u00a72254(d) a habeas\ncourt must determine what arguments or theories sup-\nported or, as here, could have supported, the state court\u2019s\ndecision\u201d). Indeed, the deference with regard to the basis\nof decision is much more \u201cblind\u201d than the deference I\nassert is necessary in the present case. I demand a state-\ncourt statement (contained in the unqualified terms of its\njudgment) that it has rejected the federal claim; I sim-\nply refuse to question the veracity of that statement. By\ncontrast, no statement is ever even required that the state\ncourt relied upon the theory of federal law that the habeas\ncourt finds validating.\n   I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by its novel\ninterpretation of \u201con the merits\u201d for purposes of \u00a72254(d).\nImagine that the state court formulated its judgment as\nfollows: \u201cAll claims raised by the defendant have been\nconsidered and denied.\u201d I cannot believe that the Court\nwould require federal courts to test the veracity of that\nstatement. Yet, as we have described, that is precisely\nwhat an (unadorned) judgment denying relief already\nconveys. Although the Court acknowledges that \u201c \u2018[w]e\nhave no power to tell state courts how they must write\ntheir opinions,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 9, its analysis would turn solely\non how the order of judgment is styled.\n   Resolution of this case is direct: Respondent\u2019s claim was\n6                  JOHNSON v. WILLIAMS\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u201cadjudicated on the merits,\u201d because the state court ren-\ndered a judgment rejecting all her claims, and the judg-\nment gave no indication (such as a statement that it was\n\u201cwithout prejudice\u201d) that it was based on a procedural or\nother nonmerits ground.\n   The Court\u2019s novel resolution of the \u201con the merits\u201d ques-\ntion produces a clear enough answer in this case. The\nweight of the evidence demonstrated that it was \u201cexceed-\ningly unlikely\u201d that the state court overlooked the federal\nclaim. Ante, at 16. But such ready resolution will not be\ncommonplace. Consider another case, where the federal\nand state claims are not related, where there is no rele-\nvant state precedent referring to federal law, where state\nlaw might be interpreted as less defendant-friendly than\nthe federal standard, or where a confluence of such factors\nexists. The answer to whether the federal claim has been\n\u201cevaluated based on the intrinsic right and wrong of the\nmatter\u201d is anybody\u2019s guess. One thing, however, is cer-\ntain: The Court\u2019s case-by-case approach will guarantee\nprotracted litigation over whether a state-court judge was\naware of a claim on the day he rejected it.\n   The Court tells us not to worry about a flood of liti-\ngation, because the Courts of Appeals have previously al-\nlowed arguments from petitioners that the state courts\noverlooked their federal claims. Ante, at 13, and n. 4\n(citing cases). But many of those cases applied a much\nsimpler (and even less justifiable) test than the one\nadopted today: if the federal claim was not addressed in\nthe opinion, then it was not adjudicated on the merits. See,\ne.g., Lyell v. Renico, 470 F. 3d 1177, 1181\u20131182 (CA6\n2006); Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F. 3d 39, 47 (CA1 2001).\nAnd even those courts that attempted to \u201cdivin[e] the\nthought processes of\u201d the judge limited their inquiry to\n\u201cwhat a state court has said.\u201d Brown v. Luebbers, 371 F.\n3d 458, 461 (CA8 2004) (emphasis added); see also, e.g.,\nChadwick v. Janecka, 312 F. 3d 597, 606 (CA3 2002). By\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n               SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncontrast, the Court today asks whether a judge thought\nabout the merits of an unaddressed claim, and leaves on\nthe table any evidence relevant to that inquiry.\n   This newly-sponsored enterprise of probing the judicial\nmind is inappropriately intrusive upon state-court pro-\ncesses. Are federal habeas courts now to consider evidence\nrelevant to the internal deliberations of the state judici-\nary? Can a petitioner introduce testimony showing that\nstate-court judges\u2014because of time constraints, heavy\ncaseloads, or other reasons\u2014fail to read the briefs but\nleave that to their assistants, whose recommendations\nthey rarely reject? Or testimony showing that, typically,\nonly one judge on the state-court appellate panel reads the\nbriefs and considers all the claims, and the others simply\njoin the drafted order? Has there been an \u201cadjudication\non the merits\u201d then? Future litigation will supply the\nanswers.\n   For these reasons, I do not join the opinion of the Court\nand concur only in the judgment.\n</pre>",
