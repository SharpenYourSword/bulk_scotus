MICHIGAN\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN\n\n No. 11\u20131327. Argued November 6, 2012\u2014Decided February 20, 2013\nAfter the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner Evans\u2019 arson\n  trial, the court granted Evans\u2019 motion for a directed verdict of acquit-\n  tal, concluding that the State had failed to prove that the burned\n  building was not a dwelling, a fact the court mistakenly believed was\n  an \u201celement\u201d of the statutory offense. The State Court of Appeals re-\n  versed and remanded for retrial. In affirming, the State Supreme\n  Court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did\n  not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an ac-\n  quittal for double jeopardy purposes.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial for Evans\u2019 offense.\n Pp. 4\u221217.\n    (a) Retrial following a court-decreed acquittal is barred, even if the\n acquittal is \u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,\u201d Fong\n Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, such as an erroneous deci-\n sion to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n 68\u221269; a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to\n sustain a conviction, Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 473; or a\n \u201cmisconstruction of the statute\u201d defining the requirements to convict,\n Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 303, 211. Most relevant here, an ac-\n quittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is insuffi-\n cient to establish criminal liability for an offense. See, e.g., United\n States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n 10. In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or\n mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals\n are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and\n thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns. Scott, 437 U. S., at\n 91. Here, the trial court clearly \u201cevaluated the [State\u2019s] evidence and\n determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d\n United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 572. Evans\u2019\n2                          EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing\n    legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the deter-\n    mination to acquit, not its essential character. See Scott, 437 U. S.,\n    at 98. Pp. 4\u22126.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court attempted to distinguish this Court\u2019s\n    cases on the ground that they involved \u201cthe sufficiency of the factual\n    elements of the charged offense,\u201d while Evans\u2019 case concerned \u201can er-\n    ror of law unrelated to [his] guilt or innocence,\u201d but this Court per-\n    ceives no such difference. This case, like the Court\u2019s previous ones,\n    involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because\n    the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.\n    The State and the United States claim that only when an actual ele-\n    ment of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the of-\n    fense, but Evans\u2019 verdict was based on something that was conceded-\n    ly not an element. Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly\n    and is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decisions since then. Martin\n    Linen focused on the significance of the District Court\u2019s acquittal\n    based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not de-\n    pend on defining the \u201celements\u201d of the offense. Culpability is the\n    touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or\n    whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct. Scott,\n    437 U. S., at 98. Pp. 7\u221211.\n       (c) Additional arguments the State and the United States raise in\n    support of the lower court\u2019s distinction are unpersuasive. The State\n    claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the\n    trial court, the only way to know whether the court\u2019s ruling was an\n    \u201cacquittal\u201d is to rely upon the court\u2019s label, which would wrongly al-\n    low the form of the trial court\u2019s action to control. However, the in-\n    stant decision turns not on the form of the trial court\u2019s action but on\n    whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes. The\n    State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal\n    are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court\n    could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to\n    convict for any reason at all. But this Court presumes that courts ex-\n    ercise their duties in good faith. The State also suggests that Evans\n    should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he in-\n    duced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most mid-\n    trial acquittals result from defense motions. The United States\n    claims that, under Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, Evans was re-\n    quired to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an\n    element of the offense before jeopardy attached. However, Lee in-\n    volved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this\n    case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s proof.\n    Pp. 11\u221214.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140. There is\n  no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so \u201cunwork-\n  able\u201d as to justify overruling precedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.\n  808, 827. And the logic of those cases still holds. As for the objection\n  that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to\n  present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a \u201cwind-\n  fall\u201d from the trial court\u2019s unreviewable error, sovereigns have power\n  to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial ac-\n  quittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to ac-\n  quit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory\n  continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

MICHIGAN\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      MICHIGAN\n\n                              [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  When the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner\nLamar Evans\u2019 arson trial, the court entered a directed\nverdict of acquittal, based upon its view that the State had\nnot provided sufficient evidence of a particular element\nof the offense. It turns out that the unproven \u201celement\u201d\nwas not actually a required element at all. We must de-\ncide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this neverthe-\nless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,\nwhich would mean that Evans could not be retried. This\nCourt has previously held that a judicial acquittal prem-\nised upon a \u201cmisconstruction\u201d of a criminal statute is an\n\u201cacquittal on the merits . . . [that] bars retrial.\u201d Arizona v.\nRumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 211 (1984). Seeing no meaningful\nconstitutional distinction between a trial court\u2019s \u201cmiscon-\nstruction\u201d of a statute and its erroneous addition of a\nstatutory element, we hold that a midtrial acquittal in\nthese circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy\npurposes as well.\n                            I\n  The State charged Evans with burning \u201cother real prop-\nerty,\u201d a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73 (1981).\n2                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State\u2019s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had\nburned down an unoccupied house. At the close of the\nState\u2019s case, however, Evans moved for a directed ver-\ndict of acquittal. He pointed the court to the applicable\nMichigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed as the\n\u201cFourth\u201d element of the offense \u201cthat the building was not\na dwelling house.\u201d 3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a731.3, p. 31\u20137\n(2d ed., Supp. 2006/2007). And the commentary to the\nInstructions emphasized, \u201can essential element is that\nthe structure burned is not a dwelling house.\u201d Id., at\n31\u20138. Evans argued that Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.72 criminal-\nizes common-law arson, which requires that the structure\nburned be a dwelling, while the provision under which he\nwas charged, \u00a7750.73, covers all other real property.1\nPersuaded, the trial court granted the motion. 491 Mich.\n1, 8, 810 N. W. 2d 535, 539 (2012). The court explained\nthat the \u201c \u2018testimony [of the homeowner] was this was a\ndwelling house,\u2019 \u201d so the nondwelling requirement of\n\u00a7750.73 was not met. Ibid.\n   On the State\u2019s appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nreversed and remanded. 288 Mich. App. 410, 794 N. W. 2d\n848 (2010). Evans had conceded, and the court held, that\nunder controlling precedent, burning \u201cother real property\u201d\nis a lesser included offense under Michigan law, and dis-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Mich.

S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproving the greater offense is not required. Id., at 416,\n794 N. W. 2d, at 852 (citing People v. Antonelli, 66 Mich.\nApp. 138, 140, 238 N. W. 2d 551, 552 (1975) (on rehear-\ning)).2 The court thus explained it was \u201cundisputed that\nthe trial court misperceived the elements of the offense\nwith which [Evans] was charged and erred by directing\na verdict.\u201d 288 Mich. App., at 416, 794 N. W. 2d, at 852.\nBut the court rejected Evans\u2019 argument that the Double\nJeopardy Clause barred retrial. Id., at 421\u2013422, 794 N. W.\n2d, at 856.\n   In a divided decision, the Supreme Court of Michigan\naffirmed. It held that \u201cwhen a trial court grants a defend-\nant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error\nof law that did not resolve any factual element of the\ncharged offense, the trial court\u2019s ruling does not constitute\nan acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and re-\ntrial is therefore not barred.\u201d 491 Mich., at 4, 810 N. W.\n2d, at 536\u2013537.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement\namong state and federal courts on the question whether\nretrial is barred when a trial court grants an acquittal be-\ncause the prosecution had failed to prove an \u201celement\u201d of\nthe offense that, in actuality, it did not have to prove.3\n567 U. S. ___ (2012). We now reverse.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In other words, the pattern jury instructions were incorrect. The\n\nState later revised them. See 288 Mich. App. 410, 416, n. 3, 794 N. W.\n2d 848, 852, n. 3 (2010).\n  3 Compare 491 Mich. 1, 810 N. W. 2d 535 (2012) (case below), and\n\nState v. Korsen, 138 Idaho 706, 716\u2013717, 69 P. 3d 126, 136\u2013137 (2003)\n(same conclusion), and United States v. Maker, 751 F. 2d 614, 624 (CA3\n1984) (same), with Carter v. State, 365 Ark. 224, 228, 227 S. W. 3d 895,\n898 (2006) (rejecting this distinction), and State v. Lynch, 79 N. J. 327,\n337\u2013343, 399 A. 2d 629, 634\u2013637 (1979) (holding double jeopardy\nbarred retrial after trial court erroneously required extra element).\n4                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    In answering this question, we do not write on a clean\nslate. Quite the opposite. It has been half a century since\nwe first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nretrial following a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac-\nquittal is \u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous founda-\ntion.\u201d Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962)\n(per curiam). A mistaken acquittal is an acquittal none-\ntheless, and we have long held that \u201c[a] verdict of acquittal\n. . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without\nputting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby vio-\nlating the Constitution.\u201d United States v. Ball, 163 U. S.\n662, 671 (1896).\n    Our cases have applied Fong Foo\u2019s principle broadly. An\nacquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, e.g., Fong Foo, 369 U. S.,\nat 143, or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of\nacquittal herself. See Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S.\n462, 467\u2013468 (2005) (collecting cases). And an acquittal\nprecludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous\ndecision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States,\n437 U. S. 54, 68\u201369, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding\nof what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,\nSmith, 543 U. S., at 473; or a \u201cmisconstruction of the stat-\nute\u201d defining the requirements to convict, Rumsey, 467\nU. S., at 203, 211; cf. Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S.\n140, 144\u2013145, n. 7 (1986). In all these circumstances, \u201cthe\nfact that the acquittal may result from erroneous eviden-\ntiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing\nlegal principles affects the accuracy of that determination,\nbut it does not alter its essential character.\u201d United States\nv. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98 (1978) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n    Most relevant here, our cases have defined an acquittal\nto encompass any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\nSee ibid., and n. 11; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n10 (1978); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430\nU. S. 564, 571 (1977). Thus an \u201cacquittal\u201d includes \u201ca\nruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to\nconvict,\u201d a \u201cfactual finding [that] necessarily establish[es]\nthe criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and\nany other \u201crulin[g] which relate[s] to the ultimate question\nof guilt or innocence.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 91, 98, and n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). These sorts of sub-\nstantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that\nmay also terminate a case midtrial, which we generally\nrefer to as dismissals or mistrials. Procedural dismissals\ninclude rulings on questions that \u201care unrelated to factual\nguilt or innocence,\u201d but \u201cwhich serve other purposes,\u201d\nincluding \u201ca legal judgment that a defendant, although\ncriminally culpable, may not be punished\u201d because of some\nproblem like an error with the indictment. Id., at 98, and\nn. 11.\n   Both procedural dismissals and substantive rulings\nresult in an early end to trial, but we explained in Scott\nthat the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.\n\u201c[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquit-\ntal,\u201d so a merits-related ruling concludes proceedings\nabsolutely. Id., at 91. This is because \u201c[t]o permit a se-\ncond trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquit-\ntal may have been, would present an unacceptably high\nrisk that the Government, with its vastly superior re-\nsources, might wear down the defendant so that \u2018even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957)). And\nretrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant\u2019s ex-\npectation of repose, for it would subject him to additional\n\u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal\u201d while \u201ccompelling\nhim to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.\u201d\nId., at 187. In contrast, a \u201ctermination of the proceedings\n6                    EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst [a defendant] on a basis unrelated to factual guilt\nor innocence of the offense of which he is accused,\u201d 437\nU. S., at 98\u201399, i.e., some procedural ground, does not pose\nthe same concerns, because no expectation of finality\nattaches to a properly granted mistrial.\n   Here, \u201cit is plain that the [trial court] . . . evaluated\nthe [State\u2019s] evidence and determined that it was legally\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 572. The trial court granted Evans\u2019 motion under\na rule that requires the court to \u201cdirect a verdict of acquit-\ntal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is\ninsufficient to support conviction.\u201d Mich. Rule Crim. Proc.\n6.419(A) (2012). And the court\u2019s oral ruling leaves no\ndoubt that it made its determination on the basis of \u201c \u2018[t]he\ntestimony\u2019 \u201d that the State had presented. 491 Mich., at 8,\n810 N. W. 2d, at 539. This ruling was not a dismissal on\na procedural ground \u201cunrelated to factual guilt or inno-\ncence,\u201d like the question of \u201cpreindictment delay\u201d in Scott,\nbut rather a determination that the State had failed to\nprove its case. 437 U. S., at 98, 99. Under our precedents,\nthen, Evans was acquitted.\n   There is no question the trial court\u2019s ruling was wrong;\nit was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what\nfacts the State needed to prove under State law. But that\nis of no moment. Martin Linen, Sanabria, Rumsey,\nSmalis, and Smith all instruct that an acquittal due to\ninsufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court\u2019s\nevaluation of the evidence was \u201ccorrect or not,\u201d Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571, and regardless of whether the\ncourt\u2019s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling\nof law. Here Evans\u2019 acquittal was the product of an \u201cerro-\nneous interpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,\u201d but\nas in our other cases, that error affects only \u201cthe accuracy\nof [the] determination\u201d to acquit, not \u201cits essential charac-\nter.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 98 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

It identified a\n\u201cconstitutionally meaningful difference\u201d between this case\nand our previous decisions. Those cases, the court found,\n\u201cinvolve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed\nto establish a factual element of the . . . crimes at issue,\u201d\nbut still ultimately involved \u201ca resolution regarding the\nsufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.\u201d\n491 Mich., at 14\u201315, 810 N. W. 2d, at 542\u2013543. When a\ncourt mistakenly \u201cidentifie[s] an extraneous element and\ndismisse[s] the case solely on that basis,\u201d however, it has\n\u201cnot resolve[d] or even address[ed] any factual element\nnecessary to establish\u201d the offense. Id., at 15, 20, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 543, 546. As a result, the court below rea-\nsoned, the case terminates \u201cbased on an error of law\nunrelated to [the] defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the ele-\nments of the charged offense,\u201d and thus falls outside the\ndefinition of an acquittal. Id., at 21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546.\n   We fail to perceive the difference. This case, like our\nprevious ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led\nto an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact\nit was not actually required to prove. Consider Rumsey.\nThere the trial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case\ninvolving a murder committed during a robbery, mistak-\nenly held that Arizona\u2019s statutory aggravating factor\ndescribing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to mur-\nders for hire. Accordingly, it found the State had failed to\nprove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. After the State success-\nfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand,\nwe held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a\ndouble jeopardy violation.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Under Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), a capital de-\n\nfendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d of the death penalty if, at the end of a separate\nsentencing proceeding, the factfinder concludes that the prosecution\n8                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  The only relevant difference between that situation and\nthis one is that in Rumsey the trial court\u2019s error was called\na \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d and a \u201cmisconstruction of the stat-\nute,\u201d 467 U. S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error has\nbeen designated the \u201cerroneous addition of [an] extraneous\nelement to the charged offense.\u201d 491 Mich., at 3\u20134, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 536. But we have emphasized that labels do\nnot control our analysis in this context; rather, the sub-\nstance of a court\u2019s decision does. See Smalis, 476 U. S.,\nat 144, n. 5; Scott, 437 U. S., at 96\u201397; Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 571. The error in Rumsey could just as easily\nhave been characterized as the erroneous addition of an\nelement of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that\nthe homicide be a murder-for-hire. Conversely, the error\nhere could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the stat-\nute\u2019s phrase \u201cbuilding or other real property\u201d to exclude\ndwellings.5 This is far too fine a distinction to be meaning-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhas failed to prove required additional facts to support a sentence of\ndeath. Thus in Rumsey, the trial court\u2019s initial \u201cjudgment, based on\nfindings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence,\namounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars any retrial of\nthe appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d 467 U. S., at 211.\n   5 Indeed, it is possible that this is what the trial court thought it was\n\ndoing, not articulating an additional element. The statute criminalizes\nburning \u201cany building or other real property, . . . other than those\nspecified in\u201d the previous section, which criminalizes the burning of a\ndwelling house. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73. In light of the statute\u2019s\nphrasing, the trial court interpreted \u201cbuilding or other real property\u201d to\nbe exclusive of the type of property described in \u00a7750.72, although the\nMichigan courts have explained that the term is actually meant to be\ninclusive. So the trial court decision could be viewed as having given\nthe statutory \u201cbuilding\u201d element an unduly narrow construction (by\nlimiting it to nondwellings), just as the trial court in Rumsey gave the\npecuniary-gain provision an unduly narrow construction (by limiting it\nto contract killings). Nevertheless, we accept the parties\u2019 and the\nMichigan courts\u2019 alternative characterization of the trial court\u2019s error\nas the \u201caddition\u201d of an extraneous element. Our observation simply\nunderscores how malleable the distinction adopted by the Michigan\nSupreme Court, and defended by the State and the United States, can\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful, and we reject the notion that a defendant\u2019s constitu-\ntional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an\nappellate court chooses to describe a trial court\u2019s error.\n   Echoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State and the\nUnited States, as well as the dissent, emphasize Martin\nLinen\u2019s description of an acquittal as the \u201cresolution,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged.\u201d 430 U. S., at 571 (emphasis added); see\nBrief for Respondent 11\u201317; see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11\u201315 (hereinafter U. S. Brief); see post, at\n6\u20138. They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause pro-\ntects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same\n\u201coffence,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl. 2, and they note that\nan offense comprises constituent parts called elements,\nwhich are facts that must be proved to sustain a convic-\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696\u2013\n697 (1993). Consequently, they argue, only if an actual\nelement of the offense is resolved can it be said that there\nhas been an acquittal of the offense, because \u201c \u2018innocence of\nthe charged offense\u2019 cannot turn on something that is\nconcededly not an element of the offense.\u201d U. S. Brief 15.\nBecause Evans\u2019 trial ended without resolution of even one\nactual element, they conclude, there was no acquittal.\n   This argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly, and it\nis inconsistent with our decisions since then. Our focus in\nMartin Linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal\nunder Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court in\nthat case had \u201cevaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and\ndetermined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-\nviction.\u201d 430 U. S., at 572. That determination of noncul-\npability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury\nverdict; our holding did not depend upon defining the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbe. And it belies the dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 11 (opinion of ALITO, \n\nJ.), that drawing this distinction is \u201cquite easy\u201d here, and that the basis\n\nfor the trial court\u2019s ruling could not be subject to \u201creal dispute.\u201d \n\n10                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201celements\u201d of the offense. As we have explained, supra,\nat 5\u20136, Scott confirms that the relevant distinction is\nbetween judicial determinations that go to \u201cthe criminal\ndefendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and those that\nhold \u201cthat a defendant, although criminally culpable, may\nnot be punished because of a supposed\u201d procedural error.\n437 U. S., at 98. Culpability (i.e., the \u201cultimate question of\nguilt or innocence\u201d) is the touchstone, not whether any\nparticular elements were resolved or whether the deter-\nmination of nonculpability was legally correct. Id., at 98,\nn. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Perhaps most inconsistent with the State\u2019s and United\nStates\u2019 argument is Burks. There we held that when a\ndefendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides\nthe \u201cGovernment ha[s] failed to come forward with suffi-\ncient proof of [the defendant\u2019s] capacity to be responsible\nfor criminal acts,\u201d the defendant has been acquitted be-\ncause the court decided that \u201ccriminal culpability ha[s] not\nbeen established.\u201d 437 U. S., at 10. Lack of insanity was\nnot an \u201celement\u201d of Burks\u2019 offense, bank robbery by use of\na dangerous weapon. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72113(d) (1976 ed.).\nRather, insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal\nliability. Our conclusion thus depended upon equating a\njudicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evi-\ndence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of any par-\nticular element of the offense.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 To  account for Burks, the United States posits that, \u201c[a]s used in\n[its] brief, the \u2018elements\u2019 of an offense encompass legally recognized\ndefenses that would negate culpability.\u201d U. S. Brief 11, n. 3. So too\nwould the dissent hold that, \u201cas used in this opinion, the \u2018elements\u2019 of\nan offense include legally recognized affirmative defenses that would\nnegate culpability.\u201d Post, at 8, n. 2. Rather than adopt a novel defini-\ntion of the word \u201celement\u201d to mean \u201celements and affirmative defenses,\u201d\nand then promptly limit that novel definition to these circumstances,\nwe prefer to read Burks for what it says, which is that the issue is\nwhether the bottom-line question of \u201ccriminal culpability\u201d was resolved.\n437 U. S., at 10.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the end, this case follows those that have come before\nit. The trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal resolved the\nquestion of Evans\u2019 guilt or innocence as a matter of\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural\ngrounds. That judgment, \u201chowever erroneous\u201d it was,\nprecludes reprosecution on this charge, and so should have\nbarred the State\u2019s appeal as well. Sanabria, 437 U. S.,\nat 69.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   The State, supported by the United States, offers three\nother reasons why the distinction drawn by the court be-\nlow should be maintained. None persuades us.\n   To start, the State argues that unless an actual element\nof the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to\nknow whether the court\u2019s ruling was an \u201cacquittal\u201d is to rely\nupon the label used by the court, which would wrongly\nallow the form of the trial court\u2019s action to control. Brief\nfor Respondent 17\u201318, 21\u201322. We disagree. Our decision\nturns not on the form of the trial court\u2019s action, but rather\nwhether it \u201cserve[s]\u201d substantive \u201cpurposes\u201d or procedural\nones. Scott, 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11. If a trial court were\nto announce, midtrial, \u201cThe defendant shall be acquitted\nbecause he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,\u201d the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause would pose no barrier to reprose-\ncution, notwithstanding the \u201cacquittal\u201d label. Cf. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82. Here we know the trial court acquitted\nEvans, not because it incanted the word \u201cacquit\u201d (which it\ndid not), but because it acted on its view that the prosecu-\ntion had failed to prove its case.\n   Next, the State and the United States fear that if the\ngrounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual\nelements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unre-\nviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for\nany reason at all, such as that the prosecution failed to\n12                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove \u201cthat the structure burned [was] blue.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 16\u201317; U. S. Brief 15. If the concern is that\nthere is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could\nyield an acquittal, the response is that we have long held\nas much. See supra, at 4. If the concern is instead that\nour holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from\nreview acquittals that are granted as a form of nullifi-\ncation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 58, we reject the\npremise. We presume here, as in other contexts, that\ncourts exercise their duties in good faith. Cf. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Finally, the State suggests that because Evans induced\nthe trial court\u2019s error, he should not be heard to complain\nwhen that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry\nhim. Brief for Respondent 32\u201333; cf. id., at 5\u20139. But we\nhave recognized that \u201cmost [judgments of acquittal] re-\nsult from defense motions,\u201d so \u201c[t]o hold that a defendant\nwaives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial\ncourt error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an\nacquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on\nwhich our system of criminal justice rests, and would\nvitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the\nFifth Amendment.\u201d Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 78 (citation\nomitted).7 It is true that when a defendant persuades the\ncourt to declare a mistrial, jeopardy continues and retrial\nis generally allowed. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S.\n600 (1976). But in such circumstances the defendant\nconsents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution,\nwhereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does\nnot. See Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 75.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent says that \u201cdefense counsel fooled the judge,\u201d post, at 6,\n\nbut surely that charge is not fair. Nothing suggests counsel exceeded\nthe permissible bounds of zealous advocacy on behalf of his client.\nCounsel presented a colorable legal argument, and marshaled persua-\nsive authority: Michigan\u2019s own criminal jury instructions, which, at the\ntime, supported his position. See supra, at 2, 3, n. 2.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The United States makes a related argument. It con-\ntends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve\nwhether nondwelling status is an element of the offense\nbefore jeopardy attached, so having elected to wait until\ntrial was underway to raise the point, he cannot now claim\na double jeopardy violation. U. S. Brief 22\u201325. The Gov-\nernment relies upon Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23\n(1977), in which the District Court dismissed an indict-\nment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required\nintent element of the offense. We held that retrial on a\ncorrected indictment was not barred, because the dismis-\nsal was akin to a mistrial, not an acquittal. This was clear\nbecause the District Court had separately denied the\ndefendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, explaining\nthat the defendant \u201c \u2018has been proven [guilty] beyond any\nreasonable doubt in the world,\u2019 \u201d while acknowledging that\nthe error in the indictment required dismissal. Id., at 26\u2013\n27. Because the defendant \u201cinvited the court to interrupt\nthe proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits\u201d\nby raising the indictment issue so late, we held the princi-\nples governing a defendant\u2019s consent to mistrial should\napply. Id., at 28 (citing Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600).\n   The Government suggests the situation here is \u201cfunc-\ntionally similar,\u201d because \u201cidentifying the elements of an\noffense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency\nof a charging document.\u201d U. S. Brief 23. But we can-\nnot ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did\nhere was rule on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s proof, not\nthe sufficiency of the information filed against him. Lee\ndemonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.\nAnd even if the Government is correct that Evans could\nhave challenged the charging document on the same legal\ntheory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\nit matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion\nthat necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.\nEvans cannot be penalized for requesting from the court a\n14                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nruling on the merits of the State\u2019s case, as the Michigan\nRules entitled him to do; whether he could have also\nbrought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside\nthe point.\n                             B\n  In the alternative, the State and the United States ask\nus to reconsider our past decisions. Brief for Respondent\n34\u201356 (suggesting overruling our cases since at least\nFong Foo); U. S. Brief 27\u201332 (suggesting overruling Smith,\nRumsey, and Smalis).8 We declined to revisit our cases\nwhen the United States made a similar request in Smalis.\n476 U. S., at 144; see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae in Smalis v. Pennsylvania, O. T. 1985, No. 85\u2013227,\npp. 19\u201325. And we decline to do so here.\n  First, we have no reason to believe the existing rules\nhave become so \u201cunworkable\u201d as to justify overruling\nprecedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).\nThe distinction drawn in Scott has stood the test of time,\nand we expect courts will continue to have little \u201cdifficulty\nin distinguishing between those rulings which relate to\nthe ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those\nwhich serve other purposes.\u201d 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., United States\nv. Dionisio, 503 F. 3d 78, 83\u201388 (CA2 2007) (collecting\ncases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Crimi-\nnal Procedure \u00a725.3(a), p. 629 (3d ed. 2007) (same).\n  Second, the logic of these cases still holds. There is no\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent\u2019s true gripe may be with these cases as well, rather than\nour result here, which, we have explained, follows inevitably from\nthem. See post, at 5 (noting \u201chow far [our cases] have departed from\nthe common-law principles that applied at the time of the founding\u201d);\ncompare post, at 12 (\u201cPermitting retrial in these egregious cases is\nespecially appropriate\u201d), with Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141,\n143 (1962) (per curiam) (according finality to even those acquittals\n\u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous foundation\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes retrial,\nand thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led\nto that acquittal. See Ball, 163 U. S., at 671. So, had the\ntrial court here instructed the jury that it must find the\nburned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict,\nthe jury would have acquitted Evans accordingly; \u201c \u2018[a] jury\nis presumed to follow its instructions.\u2019 \u201d Blueford v. Ar-\nkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (quoting\nWeeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000)). And that\nwould have been the end of the matter. From that prem-\nise, Fong Foo\u2019s holding follows: If a trial court instead\nexercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict\nof acquittal, jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any\nlegal error, because there too it is the jury that returns an\nacquittal. And from there, Martin Linen\u2019s conclusion is\nunavoidable: It should make no difference whether the\ncourt employs the formality of directing the jury to return\nan acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal\nitself. Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith merely apply\nFong Foo and Martin Linen in tandem: If a trial court\nmakes an antecedent legal error (as in Fong Foo), and\nthen grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing\nthe jury to acquit (as in Martin Linen), the result is an\nacquittal all the same.\n   In other words, there is no way for antecedent legal\nerrors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals\nunless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise\nto jury acquittals (contrary to the settled understanding\nthat a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless\nwe distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to\ntheir instructions and judicial acquittals (notwithstand-\ning that this is a purely formal distinction). Neither op-\ntion has become more attractive with time. We therefore\nreiterate: \u201cany contention that the Double Jeopardy\nClause must itself . . . leave open a way of correcting legal\nerrors is at odds with the well-established rule that the\n16                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently\nwrong in law.\u201d Smith, 543 U. S., at 473.\n   Finally, the State and the United States object that this\nrule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity\nto present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant\nreaps a \u201cwindfall\u201d from the trial court\u2019s unreviewable error.\nBrief for Respondent 6; U. S. Brief 31\u201332. But sovereigns\nare hardly powerless to prevent this sort of situation, as\nwe observed in Smith, 543 U. S., at 474. Nothing obligates\na jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a\nmidtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the\npractice. See Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7175.381(1) (2011); State v.\nParfait, 96, 1814 (La. App. 1 Cir. 05/09/97), 693 So. 2d\n1232, 1242. Many jurisdictions, including the federal\nsystem, allow or encourage their courts to defer considera-\ntion of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a\nverdict, which mitigates double jeopardy concerns.9 See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b). And for cases such as this, in\nwhich a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant criminal\nstatute is likely to prove dispositive, we see no reason why\njurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances\nor expedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to pre-\nvent misguided acquittals from being entered.10 But\nhaving chosen to vest its courts with the power to grant\nmidtrial acquittals, the State must bear the corresponding\nrisk that some acquittals will be granted in error.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 If a court grants a motion to acquit after the jury has convicted,\n\nthere is no double jeopardy barrier to an appeal by the government\nfrom the court\u2019s acquittal, because reversal would result in reinstate-\nment of the jury verdict of guilt, not a new trial. United States v.\nWilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975).\n  10 Here, the prosecutor twice asked the court for a recess to review the\n\nMichigan statutes and to discuss the question with her supervisor. 491\nMich., at 7, 810 N. W. 2d, at 538\u2013539. If the trial court\u2019s refusal was ill-\nadvised, that is a matter for state procedure to address, but it does not\nbear on the double jeopardy consequences of the acquittal that followed.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The Court\u2019s\ndecision makes no sense. It is not consistent with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause; it does\nnot serve the purposes of the prohibition against double\njeopardy; and contrary to the Court\u2019s reasoning, the trial\njudge\u2019s ruling was not an \u201cacquittal,\u201d which our cases have\n\u201cconsistently\u201d defined as a decision that \u201c \u2018actually repre-\nsents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the\nfactual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d E.g., Smith v.\nMassachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 468 (2005) (quoting United\nStates v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571\n(1977); emphasis added). For no good reason, the Court\ndeprives the State of Michigan of its right to have one fair\nopportunity to convict petitioner, and I therefore respect-\nfully dissent.\n                             I\n  After Detroit police officers heard an explosion at a\nburning house, they observed petitioner running away\nfrom the building with a gasoline can.

No one was living\nin the house at the time of the fire.\n    If the house in question had been a \u201cdwelling house,\u201d\npetitioner could have been charged under Mich. Comp.\nLaws \u00a7750.72 (1981) for burning a dwelling, an offense\npunishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. But peti-\ntioner was instead charged with \u201c[b]urning other real\nproperty\u201d in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73. This\noffense, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019\nimprisonment, applies to \u201c[a]ny person who wilfully or\nmaliciously burns any building or other real property . . .\nother than those specified in [\u00a7750.72].\u201d This crime is a\nlesser included offense of the crime of burning a dwelling\nhouse. The \u201cnecessary elements to prove either offense\nare the same, except to prove the greater [offense] it must\nbe shown that the building is a dwelling.\u201d 491 Mich. 1,\n19\u201320, 810 N. W. 2d 535, 545\u2013546 (2012) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). To prove the lesser offense, however,\n\u201c \u2018it is not necessary to prove that the building is not a\ndwelling.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 20, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546 (emphasis\nadded).\n    At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, petitioner\u2019s attor-\nney moved for a directed verdict on the ground that (1) the\nprosecution was required to prove, as an \u201celement\u201d of\nthe charged offense, that \u201cthe building was not a dwelling\u201d\nand (2) \u201cthe prosecution had failed to prove that the\nburned building was not a dwelling house.\u201d Id., at 5, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 537. The prosecutor responded by arguing\nthat nothing in the charged offense requires proof that the\nbuilding was not a dwelling, and the prosecutor requested\n\u201ca moment\u201d to \u201cpull the statute\u201d and \u201cconsult with [her]\nsupervisors.\u201d Id., at 5\u20137, 810 N. W. 2d, at 537\u2013539. The\ntrial judge denied the prosecutor\u2019s requests and errone-\nously concluded that the prosecution was required to prove\nthat the burned building was not a dwelling.

The Michigan Court of Appeals\nagreed with this concession and went on to hold that\nthe trial judge\u2019s ruling did not constitute an \u201cacquittal\u201d for\ndouble jeopardy purposes because the ruling did not rep-\nresent \u201ca resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor . . . of a fac-\ntual element necessary for a criminal conviction.\u201d Id., at\n421\u2013422, 794 N. W. 2d, at 856 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed, holding\nthat when, as here, a trial judge erroneously adds an ex-\ntra \u201celement\u201d to a charged offense and subsequently de-\ntermines that the prosecution did not prove that extra\n\u201celement,\u201d the trial judge\u2019s decision is not based on the de-\nfendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the elements of the charged\noffense. 491 Mich., at 3\u20134, 19\u201321, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536\u2013\n537, 545\u2013546. Accordingly, the Michigan Supreme Court\nconcluded that the judge\u2019s ruling in this case \u201cdoes not\nconstitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy\nand retrial is . . . not barred.\u201d Id., at 4, 810 N. W. 2d, at\n537.\n                          II\n  This Court now reverses the decision             of the State Su-\npreme Court, but the Court\u2019s holding               is supported by\nneither the original understanding of               the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy nor any of the             reasons for that\nprohibition.\n4                         EVANS v.

Scott,\n437 U. S. 82, 87 (1978); see Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28,\n33 (1978). As the Court has previously explained, \u201cthe\ncommon-law protection against double jeopardy historically\napplied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a\nverdict.\u201d Smith, 543 U. S., at 466 (emphasis added).1 As a\nresult, the original understanding of the Clause, which is\n\u201chardly a matter of dispute,\u201d Scott, supra, at 87, does not\ncompel the Court\u2019s conclusion that a defendant is acquit-\nted for double jeopardy purposes whenever a judge issues\na preverdict ruling that the prosecution has failed to prove\na nonexistent \u201celement\u201d of the charged offense.\n  Although our decisions have expanded double jeopardy\nprotection beyond its common-law origins, see, e.g., Smith,\nsupra, at 466\u2013467 (acknowledging the Court\u2019s expansion\nof \u201cthe common-law protection against double jeopardy\u201d);\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 See also Crist, 437 U.

And it is clear that in the early years of our national\nhistory the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy was\nconsidered to be equally limited in scope\u201d); 3 J.

S., at 96. And given how far we have depart-\ned from the common-law principles that applied at the\ntime of the founding, we should at least ensure that our\ndecisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the\nconstitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See\nid., at 95\u201396, 100\u2013101. Yet today\u2019s decision fails to ad-\nvance the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n                              B\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause is largely based on \u201cthe\ndeeply ingrained principle that the State with all its re-\nsources and power should not be allowed to make repeated\nattempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and or-\ndeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil-\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d\nYeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 117\u2013118 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Blueford v.\nArkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5); Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 569. Allowing retrial in the circum-\nstances of the present case would not result in any such\nabuse. The prosecution would not be afforded a second\nopportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence\nsatisfies the actual elements of the offense. Instead, be-\ncause the trial judge\u2019s ruling in the first trial was not\nbased on an actual element of the charged offense, retrial\nwould simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to\nprove its case.\n   Allowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecu-\ntors \u201cto make repeated attempts to convict an individual\nfor an alleged offense,\u201d Yeager, supra, at 117. It was\n6                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npetitioner, not the prosecutor, who sought to terminate the\ntrial prior to verdict. Thus, contrary to the Court\u2019s unex-\nplained suggestion, see ante, at 5\u20136, \u201c[t]his case hardly\npresents the specter of \u2018an all-powerful state relentlessly\npursuing a defendant who had either been found not\nguilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of\nguilt submitted to the first trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d Sattazahn v.\nPennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, 114\u2013115 (2003) (quoting\nScott, supra, at 96). On the contrary, this is a case in\nwhich defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an\nerror that provided his client with an undeserved benefit,\nthe termination of a trial that the defense obviously did\nnot want to run to completion. The Double Jeopardy\nClause does not require that the defense receive an even\ngreater benefit, the protection provided by an acquittal.\n   As this Court has repeatedly emphasized in double\njeopardy cases, a State has an interest in receiving \u201cone\ncomplete opportunity to convict those who have violated\nits laws,\u201d Sattazahn, supra, at 115 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Scott, supra, at 100, but today\u2019s decision\ndeprives the State of Michigan of this valuable right.\n                             C\n   The Court\u2019s decision also flies in the face of our estab-\nlished understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nprovides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added).          Thus, \u201c[d]ouble-\njeopardy analysis focuses on the individual \u2018offence\u2019\ncharged.\u201d Smith, 543 U. S., at 469, n. 3. And to determine\nwhat constitutes \u201cthe individual \u2018offence\u2019 charged,\u201d ibid.,\nthe Court homes in on the elements of the offense. See\nUnited States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993) (\u201cIn both\nthe multiple punishment and multiple prosecution con-\ntexts, this Court has concluded that where the two of-\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Consistent with the constitutional text\u2019s focus\non the \u201coffence\u201d\u2014and thus the elements\u2014with which a\ndefendant is charged, the Court\u2019s \u201cdouble-jeopardy cases\nhave consistently\u201d defined an acquittal as a decision that\n\u201c \u2018actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some\nor all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d\nSmith, supra, at 468 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at\n571); see also Scott, supra, at 97 (\u201c[A] defendant is acquit-\nted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,\nactually represents a resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n    Today, the Court effectively abandons the well-\nestablished definition of an acquittal. Indeed, in the face\nof our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeop-\nardy purposes requires a \u201cresolution, correct or not, of\nsome or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,\u201d\nSmith, supra, at 468; Martin Linen, supra, at 571; see\nalso Scott, supra, at 97, the Court now declares that \u201cthe\ntouchstone [is] not whether any particular elements were\nresolved,\u201d ante, at 10 (emphasis added). Instead, the\nCourt proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a\nmidtrial termination represented a \u201cprocedural dismissa[l]\u201d\nor a \u201csubstantive rulin[g],\u201d ante, at 5. This reformulation\nof double jeopardy law is not faithful to our prece-\ndents\u2014or to the Double Jeopardy Clause itself. The key\nquestion is not whether a ruling is \u201cprocedural\u201d or \u201csub-\nstantive\u201d (whatever those terms mean in this context), but\nwhether a ruling relates to the defendant\u2019s factual guilt or\ninnocence with respect to the \u201coffence,\u201d see U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 5\u2014and thus the elements\u2014with which he is\ncharged. See Scott, supra, at 87, 97\u201399, and n. 11.\n    When a judge evaluates the evidence and determines\n8                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally\nsufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged\noffense, the ruling, however labeled, represents an acquit-\ntal because it is founded on the defendant\u2019s factual inno-\ncence. See Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 572. But when a\njudge manufactures an additional \u201celement\u201d of an offense\nand then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove\nthat extra \u201celement,\u201d the judge has not resolved the de-\nfendant\u2019s \u201cfactual guilt or innocence\u201d as to any of the\nactual elements of the offense.2 Thus, the ruling, no mat-\nter what the judge calls it, does not acquit the defendant of\nthe offense with which he is charged. No acquittal occurs\nwhen a criminal trial is terminated \u201con a basis unrelated\nto factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which [a\ndefendant] is accused.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 87, 94\u201395, 98\u2013\n99. \u201c[I]n a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately\nchoosing to seek termination of the proceedings against\nhim on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of\nthe offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cog-\nnizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Govern-\nment is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial\ncourt in favor of the defendant.\u201d Id., at 98\u201399 (reasoning\nthat, in such a case, the defendant was \u201cneither acquitted\nnor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook\nto persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt\nor innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try\nhim\u201d).\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Because culpability for an offense can be negated by proof of an\n\naffirmative defense, the Court has held that a ruling that the prosecu-\ntion did not submit sufficient evidence to rebut an affirmative defense\nconstitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. See Burks v.\nUnited States, 437 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (1978); Scott, 437 U. S., at 97\u201398.\nThus, as used in this opinion, the \u201celements\u201d of an offense include\nlegally recognized affirmative defenses that would negate culpability.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In all three of the\nprincipal cases on which the Court relies\u2014Smalis v. Penn-\nsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986); Smith, 543 U. S. 462; and\nArizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203 (1984)\u2014trial judges\nruled that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof the offenses in question. In none of these cases (and in\nnone of our other double jeopardy cases) did a trial judge\nterminate a prosecution before verdict based on an ele-\nment of the judge\u2019s own creation.\n   The first two cases, Smalis and Smith, involved gar-\nden variety preverdict acquittals, i.e., rulings based on the\nground that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof an offense. (Using conventional modern terminology,\nRule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nexplicitly labels such rulings \u201cacquittal[s].\u201d)\n   In Smalis, the judge, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase in chief, granted a demurrer with respect to certain\ncharges on the ground that the evidence regarding those\ncharges was \u201clegally insufficient to support a conviction.\u201d\n476 U. S., at 141. The State Supreme Court held that this\nruling was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes\nbecause it was based on a legal determination (i.e., that\nthe evidence was not sufficient) rather than a factual\nfinding, but we rejected that distinction. Id., at 143\u2013144.\nSee also Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 71\u201372\n(1978).\n   Smith involved a similar situation. There, one of the\nelements of a firearms offense with which the defendant\nwas charged required proof that the gun \u201chad a barrel \u2018less\nthan 16 inches\u2019 in length,\u201d 543 U.

MICHIGAN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndence to establish this undisputed element, id., at 464\u2013\n465. Before the remaining charges were submitted to the\njury, however, the judge reversed this ruling and allowed\nthe charge to go to the jury. Id., at 465. We held, how-\never, that the judge\u2019s prior ruling constituted an acquittal\nand therefore barred the defendant\u2019s conviction for this\noffense. Id., at 467\u2013469. Thus, both Smalis and Smith\ninvolved rulings that were very different from the one at\nissue here. In both of those earlier cases, the trial judges\nheld that the evidence was insufficient to prove undis-\nputed elements of the offenses in question. In neither case\ndid the judge invent a new element.\n   The final case, Rumsey, differs from Smalis and Smith\nin only one particular. Like Smalis and Smith, Rumsey\ninvolved a ruling that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was in-\nsufficient to prove an element, but in Rumsey the ruling\nwas predicated on a misconstruction of an element. In\nthat case, after the defendant was found guilty of first-\ndegree murder, the \u201ctrial judge, with no jury, . . . con-\nducted a separate sentencing hearing\u201d at which he deter-\nmined that no aggravating circumstances were present. 467\nU. S., at 205. In particular, the judge found that the\nprosecution had not proved that the murder had been\ncommitted \u201c \u2018as consideration for the receipt, or in expecta-\ntion of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n205\u2013206 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013703(F)(5)\n(Supp. 1983\u20131984)). The judge reached this conclusion\nbecause, in his (incorrect) view, that aggravating circum-\nstance was limited to contract killings. 467 U. S., at 205\u2013\n206. Holding that the judge\u2019s ruling constituted an acquit-\ntal on the merits of the question whether a death sentence\nwas appropriate, we noted that the ruling rested on \u201ca\nmisconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain\naggravating circumstance.\u201d Id., at 211. Accordingly, the\nruling was based on a determination that there was insuf-\nficient evidence to prove a real element; it was not based\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non the judicial invention of an extra \u201celement.\u201d And for\nthat reason, it does not support the nonsensical result that\nthe Court reaches today.\n   The Court may feel compelled to reach that result be-\ncause it thinks that it would be unworkable to draw a\ndistinction between a preverdict termination based on the\ntrial judge\u2019s misconstruction of an element of an offense\nand a preverdict termination based on the judge\u2019s percep-\ntion that a statute contains an \u201celement\u201d that is actually\nnonexistent. This practical concern is overblown. There\nmay be cases in which this determination presents prob-\nlems, but surely there are many cases in which the de-\ntermination is quite easy. The present case is a perfect\nexample, for here there is no real dispute that the trial\njudge\u2019s ruling was based on a nonexistent statutory \u201cele-\nment.\u201d As noted, defense counsel conceded on appeal that\nthe judge had \u201cwrongly added an extraneous element to\nthe statute\u201d under which his client was charged. 491\nMich., at 3, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536.\n   Another good example is provided by State v. Korsen,\n138 Idaho 706, 69 P. 3d 126 (2003), where a Magistrate\nerroneously concluded that the offense of criminal trespass\nunder Idaho law requires a showing that the defendant\ndid something to justify the property owner\u2019s request for\nthe defendant to leave the premises. Id., at 710, 716\u2013717,\n69 P. 3d, at 130, 136\u2013137. There is no question that the\nMagistrate in Korsen \u201ceffectively created an additional\nstatutory element\u201d before concluding that the prosecution\nhad presented insufficient evidence as to this purported\n\u201celement.\u201d See ibid. (holding that double jeopardy did not\nbar a retrial because the Magistrate\u2019s \u201cfinding did not\nactually determine in [defendant\u2019s] favor any of the essen-\ntial elements of the crime of trespass\u201d).\n   Cases in which it can be said that a trial judge did not\nsimply misinterpret a real element of an offense but in-\nstead invented an entirely new and nonexistent \u201celement\u201d\n12                  EVANS v.

Argued November 6, 2012\u2014Decided February 20, 2013\nAfter the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner Evans\u2019 arson\n  trial, the court granted Evans\u2019 motion for a directed verdict of acquit-\n  tal, concluding that the State had failed to prove that the burned\n  building was not a dwelling, a fact the court mistakenly believed was\n  an \u201celement\u201d of the statutory offense. The State Court of Appeals re-\n  versed and remanded for retrial. In affirming, the State Supreme\n  Court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did\n  not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an ac-\n  quittal for double jeopardy purposes.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial for Evans\u2019 offense.\n Pp. 4\u221217.\n    (a) Retrial following a court-decreed acquittal is barred, even if the\n acquittal is \u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,\u201d Fong\n Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, such as an erroneous deci-\n sion to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n 68\u221269; a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to\n sustain a conviction, Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 473; or a\n \u201cmisconstruction of the statute\u201d defining the requirements to convict,\n Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 303, 211. Most relevant here, an ac-\n quittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution\u2019s proof is insuffi-\n cient to establish criminal liability for an offense. See, e.g., United\n States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n 10. In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or\n mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals\n are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and\n thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns. Scott, 437 U. S., at\n 91. Here, the trial court clearly \u201cevaluated the [State\u2019s] evidence and\n determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d\n United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 572. Evans\u2019\n2                          EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing\n    legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the deter-\n    mination to acquit, not its essential character. See Scott, 437 U. S.,\n    at 98. Pp. 4\u22126.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court attempted to distinguish this Court\u2019s\n    cases on the ground that they involved \u201cthe sufficiency of the factual\n    elements of the charged offense,\u201d while Evans\u2019 case concerned \u201can er-\n    ror of law unrelated to [his] guilt or innocence,\u201d but this Court per-\n    ceives no such difference. This case, like the Court\u2019s previous ones,\n    involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because\n    the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.\n    The State and the United States claim that only when an actual ele-\n    ment of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the of-\n    fense, but Evans\u2019 verdict was based on something that was conceded-\n    ly not an element. Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly\n    and is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decisions since then. Martin\n    Linen focused on the significance of the District Court\u2019s acquittal\n    based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not de-\n    pend on defining the \u201celements\u201d of the offense. Culpability is the\n    touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or\n    whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct. Scott,\n    437 U. S., at 98. Pp. 7\u221211.\n       (c) Additional arguments the State and the United States raise in\n    support of the lower court\u2019s distinction are unpersuasive. The State\n    claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the\n    trial court, the only way to know whether the court\u2019s ruling was an\n    \u201cacquittal\u201d is to rely upon the court\u2019s label, which would wrongly al-\n    low the form of the trial court\u2019s action to control. However, the in-\n    stant decision turns not on the form of the trial court\u2019s action but on\n    whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes. The\n    State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal\n    are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court\n    could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to\n    convict for any reason at all. But this Court presumes that courts ex-\n    ercise their duties in good faith. The State also suggests that Evans\n    should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he in-\n    duced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most mid-\n    trial acquittals result from defense motions. The United States\n    claims that, under Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, Evans was re-\n    quired to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an\n    element of the offense before jeopardy attached. However, Lee in-\n    volved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this\n    case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s proof.\n    Pp. 11\u221214.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140. There is\n  no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so \u201cunwork-\n  able\u201d as to justify overruling precedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.\n  808, 827. And the logic of those cases still holds. As for the objection\n  that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to\n  present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a \u201cwind-\n  fall\u201d from the trial court\u2019s unreviewable error, sovereigns have power\n  to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial ac-\n  quittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to ac-\n  quit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory\n  continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

It turns out that the unproven \u201celement\u201d\nwas not actually a required element at all. We must de-\ncide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this neverthe-\nless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,\nwhich would mean that Evans could not be retried. This\nCourt has previously held that a judicial acquittal prem-\nised upon a \u201cmisconstruction\u201d of a criminal statute is an\n\u201cacquittal on the merits . . . [that] bars retrial.\u201d Arizona v.\nRumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 211 (1984). Seeing no meaningful\nconstitutional distinction between a trial court\u2019s \u201cmiscon-\nstruction\u201d of a statute and its erroneous addition of a\nstatutory element, we hold that a midtrial acquittal in\nthese circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy\npurposes as well.\n                            I\n  The State charged Evans with burning \u201cother real prop-\nerty,\u201d a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73 (1981).\n2                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State\u2019s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had\nburned down an unoccupied house. At the close of the\nState\u2019s case, however, Evans moved for a directed ver-\ndict of acquittal. He pointed the court to the applicable\nMichigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed as the\n\u201cFourth\u201d element of the offense \u201cthat the building was not\na dwelling house.\u201d 3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. \u00a731.3, p. 31\u20137\n(2d ed., Supp. 2006/2007). And the commentary to the\nInstructions emphasized, \u201can essential element is that\nthe structure burned is not a dwelling house.\u201d Id., at\n31\u20138. Evans argued that Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.72 criminal-\nizes common-law arson, which requires that the structure\nburned be a dwelling, while the provision under which he\nwas charged, \u00a7750.73, covers all other real property.1\nPersuaded, the trial court granted the motion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8, 810 N.

Quite the opposite. It has been half a century since\nwe first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nretrial following a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac-\nquittal is \u201cbased upon an egregiously erroneous founda-\ntion.\u201d Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962)\n(per curiam). A mistaken acquittal is an acquittal none-\ntheless, and we have long held that \u201c[a] verdict of acquittal\n. . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without\nputting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby vio-\nlating the Constitution.\u201d United States v. Ball, 163 U. S.\n662, 671 (1896).\n    Our cases have applied Fong Foo\u2019s principle broadly. An\nacquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, e.g., Fong Foo, 369 U. S.,\nat 143, or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of\nacquittal herself. See Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S.\n462, 467\u2013468 (2005) (collecting cases). And an acquittal\nprecludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous\ndecision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States,\n437 U. S. 54, 68\u201369, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding\nof what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,\nSmith, 543 U.

S.\n140, 144\u2013145, n. 7 (1986). In all these circumstances, \u201cthe\nfact that the acquittal may result from erroneous eviden-\ntiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing\nlegal principles affects the accuracy of that determination,\nbut it does not alter its essential character.\u201d United States\nv.

Thus an \u201cacquittal\u201d includes \u201ca\nruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to\nconvict,\u201d a \u201cfactual finding [that] necessarily establish[es]\nthe criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and\nany other \u201crulin[g] which relate[s] to the ultimate question\nof guilt or innocence.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 91, 98, and n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). These sorts of sub-\nstantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that\nmay also terminate a case midtrial, which we generally\nrefer to as dismissals or mistrials. Procedural dismissals\ninclude rulings on questions that \u201care unrelated to factual\nguilt or innocence,\u201d but \u201cwhich serve other purposes,\u201d\nincluding \u201ca legal judgment that a defendant, although\ncriminally culpable, may not be punished\u201d because of some\nproblem like an error with the indictment. Id., at 98, and\nn. 11.\n   Both procedural dismissals and substantive rulings\nresult in an early end to trial, but we explained in Scott\nthat the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.\n\u201c[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquit-\ntal,\u201d so a merits-related ruling concludes proceedings\nabsolutely. Id., at 91. This is because \u201c[t]o permit a se-\ncond trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquit-\ntal may have been, would present an unacceptably high\nrisk that the Government, with its vastly superior re-\nsources, might wear down the defendant so that \u2018even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty,\u2019 \u201d ibid. (quoting\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957)). And\nretrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant\u2019s ex-\npectation of repose, for it would subject him to additional\n\u201cembarrassment, expense and ordeal\u201d while \u201ccompelling\nhim to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.\u201d\nId., at 187. In contrast, a \u201ctermination of the proceedings\n6                    EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst [a defendant] on a basis unrelated to factual guilt\nor innocence of the offense of which he is accused,\u201d 437\nU. S., at 98\u201399, i.e., some procedural ground, does not pose\nthe same concerns, because no expectation of finality\nattaches to a properly granted mistrial.\n   Here, \u201cit is plain that the [trial court] . . . evaluated\nthe [State\u2019s] evidence and determined that it was legally\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 572. The trial court granted Evans\u2019 motion under\na rule that requires the court to \u201cdirect a verdict of acquit-\ntal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is\ninsufficient to support conviction.\u201d Mich. Rule Crim. Proc.\n6.419(A) (2012). And the court\u2019s oral ruling leaves no\ndoubt that it made its determination on the basis of \u201c \u2018[t]he\ntestimony\u2019 \u201d that the State had presented. 491 Mich., at 8,\n810 N. W. 2d, at 539. This ruling was not a dismissal on\na procedural ground \u201cunrelated to factual guilt or inno-\ncence,\u201d like the question of \u201cpreindictment delay\u201d in Scott,\nbut rather a determination that the State had failed to\nprove its case. 437 U. S., at 98, 99. Under our precedents,\nthen, Evans was acquitted.\n   There is no question the trial court\u2019s ruling was wrong;\nit was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what\nfacts the State needed to prove under State law. But that\nis of no moment. Martin Linen, Sanabria, Rumsey,\nSmalis, and Smith all instruct that an acquittal due to\ninsufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court\u2019s\nevaluation of the evidence was \u201ccorrect or not,\u201d Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571, and regardless of whether the\ncourt\u2019s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling\nof law. Here Evans\u2019 acquittal was the product of an \u201cerro-\nneous interpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,\u201d but\nas in our other cases, that error affects only \u201cthe accuracy\nof [the] determination\u201d to acquit, not \u201cits essential charac-\nter.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 98 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

It identified a\n\u201cconstitutionally meaningful difference\u201d between this case\nand our previous decisions. Those cases, the court found,\n\u201cinvolve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed\nto establish a factual element of the . . . crimes at issue,\u201d\nbut still ultimately involved \u201ca resolution regarding the\nsufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.\u201d\n491 Mich., at 14\u201315, 810 N. W. 2d, at 542\u2013543. When a\ncourt mistakenly \u201cidentifie[s] an extraneous element and\ndismisse[s] the case solely on that basis,\u201d however, it has\n\u201cnot resolve[d] or even address[ed] any factual element\nnecessary to establish\u201d the offense. Id., at 15, 20, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 543, 546. As a result, the court below rea-\nsoned, the case terminates \u201cbased on an error of law\nunrelated to [the] defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the ele-\nments of the charged offense,\u201d and thus falls outside the\ndefinition of an acquittal. Id., at 21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546.\n   We fail to perceive the difference. This case, like our\nprevious ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led\nto an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact\nit was not actually required to prove. Consider Rumsey.\nThere the trial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case\ninvolving a murder committed during a robbery, mistak-\nenly held that Arizona\u2019s statutory aggravating factor\ndescribing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to mur-\nders for hire. Accordingly, it found the State had failed to\nprove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. After the State success-\nfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand,\nwe held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a\ndouble jeopardy violation.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Under Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), a capital de-\n\nfendant is \u201cacquitted\u201d of the death penalty if, at the end of a separate\nsentencing proceeding, the factfinder concludes that the prosecution\n8                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  The only relevant difference between that situation and\nthis one is that in Rumsey the trial court\u2019s error was called\na \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d and a \u201cmisconstruction of the stat-\nute,\u201d 467 U. S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error has\nbeen designated the \u201cerroneous addition of [an] extraneous\nelement to the charged offense.\u201d 491 Mich., at 3\u20134, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 536. But we have emphasized that labels do\nnot control our analysis in this context; rather, the sub-\nstance of a court\u2019s decision does. See Smalis, 476 U. S.,\nat 144, n. 5; Scott, 437 U. S., at 96\u201397; Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 571. The error in Rumsey could just as easily\nhave been characterized as the erroneous addition of an\nelement of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that\nthe homicide be a murder-for-hire. Conversely, the error\nhere could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the stat-\nute\u2019s phrase \u201cbuilding or other real property\u201d to exclude\ndwellings.5 This is far too fine a distinction to be meaning-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhas failed to prove required additional facts to support a sentence of\ndeath. Thus in Rumsey, the trial court\u2019s initial \u201cjudgment, based on\nfindings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence,\namounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars any retrial of\nthe appropriateness of the death penalty.\u201d 467 U. S., at 211.\n   5 Indeed, it is possible that this is what the trial court thought it was\n\ndoing, not articulating an additional element. The statute criminalizes\nburning \u201cany building or other real property, . . . other than those\nspecified in\u201d the previous section, which criminalizes the burning of a\ndwelling house. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7750.73. In light of the statute\u2019s\nphrasing, the trial court interpreted \u201cbuilding or other real property\u201d to\nbe exclusive of the type of property described in \u00a7750.72, although the\nMichigan courts have explained that the term is actually meant to be\ninclusive. So the trial court decision could be viewed as having given\nthe statutory \u201cbuilding\u201d element an unduly narrow construction (by\nlimiting it to nondwellings), just as the trial court in Rumsey gave the\npecuniary-gain provision an unduly narrow construction (by limiting it\nto contract killings). Nevertheless, we accept the parties\u2019 and the\nMichigan courts\u2019 alternative characterization of the trial court\u2019s error\nas the \u201caddition\u201d of an extraneous element. Our observation simply\nunderscores how malleable the distinction adopted by the Michigan\nSupreme Court, and defended by the State and the United States, can\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful, and we reject the notion that a defendant\u2019s constitu-\ntional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an\nappellate court chooses to describe a trial court\u2019s error.\n   Echoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State and the\nUnited States, as well as the dissent, emphasize Martin\nLinen\u2019s description of an acquittal as the \u201cresolution,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged.\u201d 430 U. S., at 571 (emphasis added); see\nBrief for Respondent 11\u201317; see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11\u201315 (hereinafter U. S. Brief); see post, at\n6\u20138. They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause pro-\ntects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same\n\u201coffence,\u201d U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl. 2, and they note that\nan offense comprises constituent parts called elements,\nwhich are facts that must be proved to sustain a convic-\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696\u2013\n697 (1993). Consequently, they argue, only if an actual\nelement of the offense is resolved can it be said that there\nhas been an acquittal of the offense, because \u201c \u2018innocence of\nthe charged offense\u2019 cannot turn on something that is\nconcededly not an element of the offense.\u201d U. S. Brief 15.\nBecause Evans\u2019 trial ended without resolution of even one\nactual element, they conclude, there was no acquittal.\n   This argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly, and it\nis inconsistent with our decisions since then. Our focus in\nMartin Linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal\nunder Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court in\nthat case had \u201cevaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and\ndetermined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-\nviction.\u201d 430 U. S., at 572. That determination of noncul-\npability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury\nverdict; our holding did not depend upon defining the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nbe. And it belies the dissent\u2019s suggestion, post, at 11 (opinion of ALITO, \n\nJ.), that drawing this distinction is \u201cquite easy\u201d here, and that the basis\n\nfor the trial court\u2019s ruling could not be subject to \u201creal dispute.\u201d \n\n10                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201celements\u201d of the offense. As we have explained, supra,\nat 5\u20136, Scott confirms that the relevant distinction is\nbetween judicial determinations that go to \u201cthe criminal\ndefendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability,\u201d and those that\nhold \u201cthat a defendant, although criminally culpable, may\nnot be punished because of a supposed\u201d procedural error.\n437 U. S., at 98. Culpability (i.e., the \u201cultimate question of\nguilt or innocence\u201d) is the touchstone, not whether any\nparticular elements were resolved or whether the deter-\nmination of nonculpability was legally correct. Id., at 98,\nn. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Perhaps most inconsistent with the State\u2019s and United\nStates\u2019 argument is Burks. There we held that when a\ndefendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides\nthe \u201cGovernment ha[s] failed to come forward with suffi-\ncient proof of [the defendant\u2019s] capacity to be responsible\nfor criminal acts,\u201d the defendant has been acquitted be-\ncause the court decided that \u201ccriminal culpability ha[s] not\nbeen established.\u201d 437 U. S., at 10. Lack of insanity was\nnot an \u201celement\u201d of Burks\u2019 offense, bank robbery by use of\na dangerous weapon. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a72113(d) (1976 ed.).\nRather, insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal\nliability. Our conclusion thus depended upon equating a\njudicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evi-\ndence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of any par-\nticular element of the offense.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 To  account for Burks, the United States posits that, \u201c[a]s used in\n[its] brief, the \u2018elements\u2019 of an offense encompass legally recognized\ndefenses that would negate culpability.\u201d U. S. Brief 11, n. 3. So too\nwould the dissent hold that, \u201cas used in this opinion, the \u2018elements\u2019 of\nan offense include legally recognized affirmative defenses that would\nnegate culpability.\u201d Post, at 8, n. 2. Rather than adopt a novel defini-\ntion of the word \u201celement\u201d to mean \u201celements and affirmative defenses,\u201d\nand then promptly limit that novel definition to these circumstances,\nwe prefer to read Burks for what it says, which is that the issue is\nwhether the bottom-line question of \u201ccriminal culpability\u201d was resolved.\n437 U. S., at 10.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the end, this case follows those that have come before\nit. The trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal resolved the\nquestion of Evans\u2019 guilt or innocence as a matter of\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural\ngrounds. That judgment, \u201chowever erroneous\u201d it was,\nprecludes reprosecution on this charge, and so should have\nbarred the State\u2019s appeal as well. Sanabria, 437 U. S.,\nat 69.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   The State, supported by the United States, offers three\nother reasons why the distinction drawn by the court be-\nlow should be maintained. None persuades us.\n   To start, the State argues that unless an actual element\nof the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to\nknow whether the court\u2019s ruling was an \u201cacquittal\u201d is to rely\nupon the label used by the court, which would wrongly\nallow the form of the trial court\u2019s action to control. Brief\nfor Respondent 17\u201318, 21\u201322. We disagree. Our decision\nturns not on the form of the trial court\u2019s action, but rather\nwhether it \u201cserve[s]\u201d substantive \u201cpurposes\u201d or procedural\nones. Scott, 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11. If a trial court were\nto announce, midtrial, \u201cThe defendant shall be acquitted\nbecause he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,\u201d the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause would pose no barrier to reprose-\ncution, notwithstanding the \u201cacquittal\u201d label. Cf. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82. Here we know the trial court acquitted\nEvans, not because it incanted the word \u201cacquit\u201d (which it\ndid not), but because it acted on its view that the prosecu-\ntion had failed to prove its case.\n   Next, the State and the United States fear that if the\ngrounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual\nelements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unre-\nviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for\nany reason at all, such as that the prosecution failed to\n12                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove \u201cthat the structure burned [was] blue.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 16\u201317; U. S. Brief 15. If the concern is that\nthere is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could\nyield an acquittal, the response is that we have long held\nas much. See supra, at 4. If the concern is instead that\nour holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from\nreview acquittals that are granted as a form of nullifi-\ncation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 58, we reject the\npremise. We presume here, as in other contexts, that\ncourts exercise their duties in good faith. Cf. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Finally, the State suggests that because Evans induced\nthe trial court\u2019s error, he should not be heard to complain\nwhen that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry\nhim. Brief for Respondent 32\u201333; cf. id., at 5\u20139. But we\nhave recognized that \u201cmost [judgments of acquittal] re-\nsult from defense motions,\u201d so \u201c[t]o hold that a defendant\nwaives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial\ncourt error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an\nacquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on\nwhich our system of criminal justice rests, and would\nvitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the\nFifth Amendment.\u201d Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 78 (citation\nomitted).7 It is true that when a defendant persuades the\ncourt to declare a mistrial, jeopardy continues and retrial\nis generally allowed. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S.\n600 (1976). But in such circumstances the defendant\nconsents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution,\nwhereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does\nnot. See Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 75.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The dissent says that \u201cdefense counsel fooled the judge,\u201d post, at 6,\n\nbut surely that charge is not fair. Nothing suggests counsel exceeded\nthe permissible bounds of zealous advocacy on behalf of his client.\nCounsel presented a colorable legal argument, and marshaled persua-\nsive authority: Michigan\u2019s own criminal jury instructions, which, at the\ntime, supported his position. See supra, at 2, 3, n. 2.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The United States makes a related argument. It con-\ntends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve\nwhether nondwelling status is an element of the offense\nbefore jeopardy attached, so having elected to wait until\ntrial was underway to raise the point, he cannot now claim\na double jeopardy violation. U. S. Brief 22\u201325. The Gov-\nernment relies upon Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23\n(1977), in which the District Court dismissed an indict-\nment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required\nintent element of the offense. We held that retrial on a\ncorrected indictment was not barred, because the dismis-\nsal was akin to a mistrial, not an acquittal. This was clear\nbecause the District Court had separately denied the\ndefendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, explaining\nthat the defendant \u201c \u2018has been proven [guilty] beyond any\nreasonable doubt in the world,\u2019 \u201d while acknowledging that\nthe error in the indictment required dismissal. Id., at 26\u2013\n27. Because the defendant \u201cinvited the court to interrupt\nthe proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits\u201d\nby raising the indictment issue so late, we held the princi-\nples governing a defendant\u2019s consent to mistrial should\napply. Id., at 28 (citing Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600).\n   The Government suggests the situation here is \u201cfunc-\ntionally similar,\u201d because \u201cidentifying the elements of an\noffense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency\nof a charging document.\u201d U. S. Brief 23. But we can-\nnot ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did\nhere was rule on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s proof, not\nthe sufficiency of the information filed against him. Lee\ndemonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.\nAnd even if the Government is correct that Evans could\nhave challenged the charging document on the same legal\ntheory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\nit matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion\nthat necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.\nEvans cannot be penalized for requesting from the court a\n14                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nruling on the merits of the State\u2019s case, as the Michigan\nRules entitled him to do; whether he could have also\nbrought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside\nthe point.\n                             B\n  In the alternative, the State and the United States ask\nus to reconsider our past decisions. Brief for Respondent\n34\u201356 (suggesting overruling our cases since at least\nFong Foo); U. S. Brief 27\u201332 (suggesting overruling Smith,\nRumsey, and Smalis).8 We declined to revisit our cases\nwhen the United States made a similar request in Smalis.\n476 U. S., at 144; see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae in Smalis v. Pennsylvania, O. T. 1985, No. 85\u2013227,\npp. 19\u201325. And we decline to do so here.\n  First, we have no reason to believe the existing rules\nhave become so \u201cunworkable\u201d as to justify overruling\nprecedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).\nThe distinction drawn in Scott has stood the test of time,\nand we expect courts will continue to have little \u201cdifficulty\nin distinguishing between those rulings which relate to\nthe ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those\nwhich serve other purposes.\u201d 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., United States\nv. Dionisio, 503 F. 3d 78, 83\u201388 (CA2 2007) (collecting\ncases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O.

See Ball, 163 U. S., at 671. So, had the\ntrial court here instructed the jury that it must find the\nburned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict,\nthe jury would have acquitted Evans accordingly; \u201c \u2018[a] jury\nis presumed to follow its instructions.\u2019 \u201d Blueford v. Ar-\nkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (quoting\nWeeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000)). And that\nwould have been the end of the matter. From that prem-\nise, Fong Foo\u2019s holding follows: If a trial court instead\nexercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict\nof acquittal, jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any\nlegal error, because there too it is the jury that returns an\nacquittal. And from there, Martin Linen\u2019s conclusion is\nunavoidable: It should make no difference whether the\ncourt employs the formality of directing the jury to return\nan acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal\nitself. Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith merely apply\nFong Foo and Martin Linen in tandem: If a trial court\nmakes an antecedent legal error (as in Fong Foo), and\nthen grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing\nthe jury to acquit (as in Martin Linen), the result is an\nacquittal all the same.\n   In other words, there is no way for antecedent legal\nerrors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals\nunless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise\nto jury acquittals (contrary to the settled understanding\nthat a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless\nwe distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to\ntheir instructions and judicial acquittals (notwithstand-\ning that this is a purely formal distinction). Neither op-\ntion has become more attractive with time. We therefore\nreiterate: \u201cany contention that the Double Jeopardy\nClause must itself . . . leave open a way of correcting legal\nerrors is at odds with the well-established rule that the\n16                       EVANS v.

S., at 473.\n   Finally, the State and the United States object that this\nrule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity\nto present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant\nreaps a \u201cwindfall\u201d from the trial court\u2019s unreviewable error.\nBrief for Respondent 6; U. S. Brief 31\u201332. But sovereigns\nare hardly powerless to prevent this sort of situation, as\nwe observed in Smith, 543 U. S., at 474. Nothing obligates\na jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a\nmidtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the\npractice. See Nev. Rev.

Many jurisdictions, including the federal\nsystem, allow or encourage their courts to defer considera-\ntion of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a\nverdict, which mitigates double jeopardy concerns.9 See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b). And for cases such as this, in\nwhich a trial court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant criminal\nstatute is likely to prove dispositive, we see no reason why\njurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances\nor expedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to pre-\nvent misguided acquittals from being entered.10 But\nhaving chosen to vest its courts with the power to grant\nmidtrial acquittals, the State must bear the corresponding\nrisk that some acquittals will be granted in error.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 If a court grants a motion to acquit after the jury has convicted,\n\nthere is no double jeopardy barrier to an appeal by the government\nfrom the court\u2019s acquittal, because reversal would result in reinstate-\nment of the jury verdict of guilt, not a new trial.

The Court\u2019s\ndecision makes no sense. It is not consistent with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause; it does\nnot serve the purposes of the prohibition against double\njeopardy; and contrary to the Court\u2019s reasoning, the trial\njudge\u2019s ruling was not an \u201cacquittal,\u201d which our cases have\n\u201cconsistently\u201d defined as a decision that \u201c \u2018actually repre-\nsents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the\nfactual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d E.g., Smith v.\nMassachusetts, 543 U.

And given how far we have depart-\ned from the common-law principles that applied at the\ntime of the founding, we should at least ensure that our\ndecisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the\nconstitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See\nid., at 95\u201396, 100\u2013101. Yet today\u2019s decision fails to ad-\nvance the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n                              B\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause is largely based on \u201cthe\ndeeply ingrained principle that the State with all its re-\nsources and power should not be allowed to make repeated\nattempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and or-\ndeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil-\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d\nYeager v.

Allowing retrial in the circum-\nstances of the present case would not result in any such\nabuse. The prosecution would not be afforded a second\nopportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence\nsatisfies the actual elements of the offense. Instead, be-\ncause the trial judge\u2019s ruling in the first trial was not\nbased on an actual element of the charged offense, retrial\nwould simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to\nprove its case.\n   Allowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecu-\ntors \u201cto make repeated attempts to convict an individual\nfor an alleged offense,\u201d Yeager, supra, at 117.

Thus, contrary to the Court\u2019s unex-\nplained suggestion, see ante, at 5\u20136, \u201c[t]his case hardly\npresents the specter of \u2018an all-powerful state relentlessly\npursuing a defendant who had either been found not\nguilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of\nguilt submitted to the first trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d Sattazahn v.\nPennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, 114\u2013115 (2003) (quoting\nScott, supra, at 96). On the contrary, this is a case in\nwhich defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an\nerror that provided his client with an undeserved benefit,\nthe termination of a trial that the defense obviously did\nnot want to run to completion. The Double Jeopardy\nClause does not require that the defense receive an even\ngreater benefit, the protection provided by an acquittal.\n   As this Court has repeatedly emphasized in double\njeopardy cases, a State has an interest in receiving \u201cone\ncomplete opportunity to convict those who have violated\nits laws,\u201d Sattazahn, supra, at 115 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Scott, supra, at 100, but today\u2019s decision\ndeprives the State of Michigan of this valuable right.\n                             C\n   The Court\u2019s decision also flies in the face of our estab-\nlished understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nprovides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added).

And to determine\nwhat constitutes \u201cthe individual \u2018offence\u2019 charged,\u201d ibid.,\nthe Court homes in on the elements of the offense. See\nUnited States v. Dixon, 509 U.

Consistent with the constitutional text\u2019s focus\non the \u201coffence\u201d\u2014and thus the elements\u2014with which a\ndefendant is charged, the Court\u2019s \u201cdouble-jeopardy cases\nhave consistently\u201d defined an acquittal as a decision that\n\u201c \u2018actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some\nor all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d\nSmith, supra, at 468 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at\n571); see also Scott, supra, at 97 (\u201c[A] defendant is acquit-\nted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,\nactually represents a resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n    Today, the Court effectively abandons the well-\nestablished definition of an acquittal. Indeed, in the face\nof our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeop-\nardy purposes requires a \u201cresolution, correct or not, of\nsome or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,\u201d\nSmith, supra, at 468; Martin Linen, supra, at 571; see\nalso Scott, supra, at 97, the Court now declares that \u201cthe\ntouchstone [is] not whether any particular elements were\nresolved,\u201d ante, at 10 (emphasis added). Instead, the\nCourt proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a\nmidtrial termination represented a \u201cprocedural dismissa[l]\u201d\nor a \u201csubstantive rulin[g],\u201d ante, at 5. This reformulation\nof double jeopardy law is not faithful to our prece-\ndents\u2014or to the Double Jeopardy Clause itself. The key\nquestion is not whether a ruling is \u201cprocedural\u201d or \u201csub-\nstantive\u201d (whatever those terms mean in this context), but\nwhether a ruling relates to the defendant\u2019s factual guilt or\ninnocence with respect to the \u201coffence,\u201d see U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 5\u2014and thus the elements\u2014with which he is\ncharged. See Scott, supra, at 87, 97\u201399, and n. 11.\n    When a judge evaluates the evidence and determines\n8                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally\nsufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged\noffense, the ruling, however labeled, represents an acquit-\ntal because it is founded on the defendant\u2019s factual inno-\ncence. See Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 572. But when a\njudge manufactures an additional \u201celement\u201d of an offense\nand then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove\nthat extra \u201celement,\u201d the judge has not resolved the de-\nfendant\u2019s \u201cfactual guilt or innocence\u201d as to any of the\nactual elements of the offense.2 Thus, the ruling, no mat-\nter what the judge calls it, does not acquit the defendant of\nthe offense with which he is charged. No acquittal occurs\nwhen a criminal trial is terminated \u201con a basis unrelated\nto factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which [a\ndefendant] is accused.\u201d Scott, 437 U. S., at 87, 94\u201395, 98\u2013\n99. \u201c[I]n a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately\nchoosing to seek termination of the proceedings against\nhim on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of\nthe offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cog-\nnizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Govern-\nment is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial\ncourt in favor of the defendant.\u201d Id., at 98\u201399 (reasoning\nthat, in such a case, the defendant was \u201cneither acquitted\nnor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook\nto persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt\nor innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try\nhim\u201d).\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Because culpability for an offense can be negated by proof of an\n\naffirmative defense, the Court has held that a ruling that the prosecu-\ntion did not submit sufficient evidence to rebut an affirmative defense\nconstitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. See Burks v.\nUnited States, 437 U. S. 1, 10\u201311 (1978); Scott, 437 U. S., at 97\u201398.\nThus, as used in this opinion, the \u201celements\u201d of an offense include\nlegally recognized affirmative defenses that would negate culpability.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   Contrary to the Court\u2019s opinion, its decision in this case\nis not supported by prior precedent. In all three of the\nprincipal cases on which the Court relies\u2014Smalis v. Penn-\nsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986); Smith, 543 U. S. 462; and\nArizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203 (1984)\u2014trial judges\nruled that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof the offenses in question. In none of these cases (and in\nnone of our other double jeopardy cases) did a trial judge\nterminate a prosecution before verdict based on an ele-\nment of the judge\u2019s own creation.\n   The first two cases, Smalis and Smith, involved gar-\nden variety preverdict acquittals, i.e., rulings based on the\nground that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof an offense. (Using conventional modern terminology,\nRule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nexplicitly labels such rulings \u201cacquittal[s].\u201d)\n   In Smalis, the judge, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s\ncase in chief, granted a demurrer with respect to certain\ncharges on the ground that the evidence regarding those\ncharges was \u201clegally insufficient to support a conviction.\u201d\n476 U. S., at 141. The State Supreme Court held that this\nruling was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes\nbecause it was based on a legal determination (i.e., that\nthe evidence was not sufficient) rather than a factual\nfinding, but we rejected that distinction. Id., at 143\u2013144.\nSee also Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 71\u201372\n(1978).\n   Smith involved a similar situation. There, one of the\nelements of a firearms offense with which the defendant\nwas charged required proof that the gun \u201chad a barrel \u2018less\nthan 16 inches\u2019 in length,\u201d 543 U. S., at 464, and the trial\njudge dismissed this charge before verdict on the ground\nthat the prosecution had not introduced sufficient evi-\n10                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndence to establish this undisputed element, id., at 464\u2013\n465. Before the remaining charges were submitted to the\njury, however, the judge reversed this ruling and allowed\nthe charge to go to the jury. Id., at 465. We held, how-\never, that the judge\u2019s prior ruling constituted an acquittal\nand therefore barred the defendant\u2019s conviction for this\noffense. Id., at 467\u2013469. Thus, both Smalis and Smith\ninvolved rulings that were very different from the one at\nissue here. In both of those earlier cases, the trial judges\nheld that the evidence was insufficient to prove undis-\nputed elements of the offenses in question. In neither case\ndid the judge invent a new element.\n   The final case, Rumsey, differs from Smalis and Smith\nin only one particular. Like Smalis and Smith, Rumsey\ninvolved a ruling that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was in-\nsufficient to prove an element, but in Rumsey the ruling\nwas predicated on a misconstruction of an element. In\nthat case, after the defendant was found guilty of first-\ndegree murder, the \u201ctrial judge, with no jury, . . . con-\nducted a separate sentencing hearing\u201d at which he deter-\nmined that no aggravating circumstances were present. 467\nU. S., at 205. In particular, the judge found that the\nprosecution had not proved that the murder had been\ncommitted \u201c \u2018as consideration for the receipt, or in expecta-\ntion of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n205\u2013206 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a713\u2013703(F)(5)\n(Supp. 1983\u20131984)). The judge reached this conclusion\nbecause, in his (incorrect) view, that aggravating circum-\nstance was limited to contract killings. 467 U. S., at 205\u2013\n206. Holding that the judge\u2019s ruling constituted an acquit-\ntal on the merits of the question whether a death sentence\nwas appropriate, we noted that the ruling rested on \u201ca\nmisconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain\naggravating circumstance.\u201d Id., at 211. Accordingly, the\nruling was based on a determination that there was insuf-\nficient evidence to prove a real element; it was not based\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non the judicial invention of an extra \u201celement.\u201d And for\nthat reason, it does not support the nonsensical result that\nthe Court reaches today.\n   The Court may feel compelled to reach that result be-\ncause it thinks that it would be unworkable to draw a\ndistinction between a preverdict termination based on the\ntrial judge\u2019s misconstruction of an element of an offense\nand a preverdict termination based on the judge\u2019s percep-\ntion that a statute contains an \u201celement\u201d that is actually\nnonexistent. This practical concern is overblown. There\nmay be cases in which this determination presents prob-\nlems, but surely there are many cases in which the de-\ntermination is quite easy. The present case is a perfect\nexample, for here there is no real dispute that the trial\njudge\u2019s ruling was based on a nonexistent statutory \u201cele-\nment.\u201d As noted, defense counsel conceded on appeal that\nthe judge had \u201cwrongly added an extraneous element to\nthe statute\u201d under which his client was charged. 491\nMich., at 3, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536.\n   Another good example is provided by State v. Korsen,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595006\"><a href=\"/idaho/eipu/state-v-korsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 P. 3d 126 (2003), where a Magistrate\nerroneously concluded that the offense of criminal trespass\nunder Idaho law requires a showing that the defendant\ndid something to justify the property owner\u2019s request for\nthe defendant to leave the premises. Id., at 710, 716\u2013717,\n69 P. 3d, at 130, 136\u2013137. There is no question that the\nMagistrate in Korsen \u201ceffectively created an additional\nstatutory element\u201d before concluding that the prosecution\nhad presented insufficient evidence as to this purported\n\u201celement.\u201d See ibid.
