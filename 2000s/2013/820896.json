MICHIGAN\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN\n\n No. 11–1327. Argued November 6, 2012—Decided February 20, 2013\nAfter the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner Evans’ arson\n  trial, the court granted Evans’ motion for a directed verdict of acquit-\n  tal, concluding that the State had failed to prove that the burned\n  building was not a dwelling, a fact the court mistakenly believed was\n  an “element” of the statutory offense. The State Court of Appeals re-\n  versed and remanded for retrial. In affirming, the State Supreme\n  Court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did\n  not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an ac-\n  quittal for double jeopardy purposes.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial for Evans’ offense.\n Pp. 4−17.\n    (a) Retrial following a court-decreed acquittal is barred, even if the\n acquittal is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,” Fong\n Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, such as an erroneous deci-\n sion to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n 68−69; a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to\n sustain a conviction, Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 473; or a\n “misconstruction of the statute” defining the requirements to convict,\n Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 303, 211. Most relevant here, an ac-\n quittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution’s proof is insuffi-\n cient to establish criminal liability for an offense. See, e.g., United\n States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n 10. In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or\n mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals\n are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and\n thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns. Scott, 437 U. S., at\n 91. Here, the trial court clearly “evaluated the [State’s] evidence and\n determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.”\n United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 572. Evans’\n2                          EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing\n    legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the deter-\n    mination to acquit, not its essential character. See Scott, 437 U. S.,\n    at 98. Pp. 4−6.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court attempted to distinguish this Court’s\n    cases on the ground that they involved “the sufficiency of the factual\n    elements of the charged offense,” while Evans’ case concerned “an er-\n    ror of law unrelated to [his] guilt or innocence,” but this Court per-\n    ceives no such difference. This case, like the Court’s previous ones,\n    involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because\n    the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.\n    The State and the United States claim that only when an actual ele-\n    ment of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the of-\n    fense, but Evans’ verdict was based on something that was conceded-\n    ly not an element. Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly\n    and is inconsistent with this Court’s decisions since then. Martin\n    Linen focused on the significance of the District Court’s acquittal\n    based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not de-\n    pend on defining the “elements” of the offense. Culpability is the\n    touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or\n    whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct. Scott,\n    437 U. S., at 98. Pp. 7−11.\n       (c) Additional arguments the State and the United States raise in\n    support of the lower court’s distinction are unpersuasive. The State\n    claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the\n    trial court, the only way to know whether the court’s ruling was an\n    “acquittal” is to rely upon the court’s label, which would wrongly al-\n    low the form of the trial court’s action to control. However, the in-\n    stant decision turns not on the form of the trial court’s action but on\n    whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes. The\n    State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal\n    are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court\n    could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to\n    convict for any reason at all. But this Court presumes that courts ex-\n    ercise their duties in good faith. The State also suggests that Evans\n    should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he in-\n    duced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most mid-\n    trial acquittals result from defense motions. The United States\n    claims that, under Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, Evans was re-\n    quired to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an\n    element of the offense before jeopardy attached. However, Lee in-\n    volved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this\n    case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the State’s proof.\n    Pp. 11−14.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n    (d) This Court declines to revisit decisions such as Fong Foo,\n  Smith, Rumsey, and Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140. There is\n  no reason to believe that the existing rules have become so “unwork-\n  able” as to justify overruling precedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.\n  808, 827. And the logic of those cases still holds. As for the objection\n  that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to\n  present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a “wind-\n  fall” from the trial court’s unreviewable error, sovereigns have power\n  to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial ac-\n  quittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to ac-\n  quit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory\n  continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

MICHIGAN\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      MICHIGAN\n\n                              [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  When the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner\nLamar Evans’ arson trial, the court entered a directed\nverdict of acquittal, based upon its view that the State had\nnot provided sufficient evidence of a particular element\nof the offense. It turns out that the unproven “element”\nwas not actually a required element at all. We must de-\ncide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this neverthe-\nless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,\nwhich would mean that Evans could not be retried. This\nCourt has previously held that a judicial acquittal prem-\nised upon a “misconstruction” of a criminal statute is an\n“acquittal on the merits . . . [that] bars retrial.” Arizona v.\nRumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 211 (1984). Seeing no meaningful\nconstitutional distinction between a trial court’s “miscon-\nstruction” of a statute and its erroneous addition of a\nstatutory element, we hold that a midtrial acquittal in\nthese circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy\npurposes as well.\n                            I\n  The State charged Evans with burning “other real prop-\nerty,” a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73 (1981).\n2                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State’s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had\nburned down an unoccupied house. At the close of the\nState’s case, however, Evans moved for a directed ver-\ndict of acquittal. He pointed the court to the applicable\nMichigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed as the\n“Fourth” element of the offense “that the building was not\na dwelling house.” 3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. §31.3, p. 31–7\n(2d ed., Supp. 2006/2007). And the commentary to the\nInstructions emphasized, “an essential element is that\nthe structure burned is not a dwelling house.” Id., at\n31–8. Evans argued that Mich. Comp. Laws §750.72 criminal-\nizes common-law arson, which requires that the structure\nburned be a dwelling, while the provision under which he\nwas charged, §750.73, covers all other real property.1\nPersuaded, the trial court granted the motion. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8, 810 N.

Ibid.\n   On the State’s appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nreversed and remanded. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Antonelli, 66 Mich.\nApp. 138, 140, 238 N. W. 2d 551, 552 (1975) (on rehear-\ning)).2 The court thus explained it was “undisputed that\nthe trial court misperceived the elements of the offense\nwith which [Evans] was charged and erred by directing\na verdict.” 288 Mich. App., at 416, 794 N. W. 2d, at 852.\nBut the court rejected Evans’ argument that the Double\nJeopardy Clause barred retrial. Id., at 421–422, 794 N. W.\n2d, at 856.\n   In a divided decision, the Supreme Court of Michigan\naffirmed. It held that “when a trial court grants a defend-\nant’s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error\nof law that did not resolve any factual element of the\ncharged offense, the trial court’s ruling does not constitute\nan acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and re-\ntrial is therefore not barred.” 491 Mich., at 4, 810 N. W.\n2d, at 536–537.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement\namong state and federal courts on the question whether\nretrial is barred when a trial court grants an acquittal be-\ncause the prosecution had failed to prove an “element” of\nthe offense that, in actuality, it did not have to prove.3\n567 U.

MICHIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    In answering this question, we do not write on a clean\nslate. Quite the opposite. It has been half a century since\nwe first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nretrial following a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac-\nquittal is “based upon an egregiously erroneous founda-\ntion.” Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962)\n(per curiam). A mistaken acquittal is an acquittal none-\ntheless, and we have long held that “[a] verdict of acquittal\n. . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without\nputting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby vio-\nlating the Constitution.” United States v. Ball, 163 U. S.\n662, 671 (1896).\n    Our cases have applied Fong Foo’s principle broadly. An\nacquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, e.g., Fong Foo, 369 U. S.,\nat 143, or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of\nacquittal herself. See Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S.\n462, 467–468 (2005) (collecting cases). And an acquittal\nprecludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous\ndecision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States,\n437 U. S. 54, 68–69, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding\nof what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,\nSmith, 543 U. S., at 473; or a “misconstruction of the stat-\nute” defining the requirements to convict, Rumsey, 467\nU. S., at 203, 211; cf. Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S.\n140, 144–145, n. 7 (1986). In all these circumstances, “the\nfact that the acquittal may result from erroneous eviden-\ntiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing\nlegal principles affects the accuracy of that determination,\nbut it does not alter its essential character.” United States\nv. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98 (1978) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n    Most relevant here, our cases have defined an acquittal\nto encompass any ruling that the prosecution’s proof is\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\nSee ibid., and n. 11; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n10 (1978); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430\nU. S. 564, 571 (1977). Thus an “acquittal” includes “a\nruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to\nconvict,” a “factual finding [that] necessarily establish[es]\nthe criminal defendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” and\nany other “rulin[g] which relate[s] to the ultimate question\nof guilt or innocence.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 91, 98, and n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). These sorts of sub-\nstantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that\nmay also terminate a case midtrial, which we generally\nrefer to as dismissals or mistrials. Procedural dismissals\ninclude rulings on questions that “are unrelated to factual\nguilt or innocence,” but “which serve other purposes,”\nincluding “a legal judgment that a defendant, although\ncriminally culpable, may not be punished” because of some\nproblem like an error with the indictment. Id., at 98, and\nn. 11.\n   Both procedural dismissals and substantive rulings\nresult in an early end to trial, but we explained in Scott\nthat the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.\n“[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquit-\ntal,” so a merits-related ruling concludes proceedings\nabsolutely. Id., at 91. This is because “[t]o permit a se-\ncond trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquit-\ntal may have been, would present an unacceptably high\nrisk that the Government, with its vastly superior re-\nsources, might wear down the defendant so that ‘even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty,’ ” ibid. (quoting\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957)). And\nretrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant’s ex-\npectation of repose, for it would subject him to additional\n“embarrassment, expense and ordeal” while “compelling\nhim to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.”\nId., at 187. In contrast, a “termination of the proceedings\n6                    EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst [a defendant] on a basis unrelated to factual guilt\nor innocence of the offense of which he is accused,” 437\nU. S., at 98–99, i.e., some procedural ground, does not pose\nthe same concerns, because no expectation of finality\nattaches to a properly granted mistrial.\n   Here, “it is plain that the [trial court] . . . evaluated\nthe [State’s] evidence and determined that it was legally\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 572. The trial court granted Evans’ motion under\na rule that requires the court to “direct a verdict of acquit-\ntal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is\ninsufficient to support conviction.” Mich. Rule Crim. Proc.\n6.419(A) (2012). And the court’s oral ruling leaves no\ndoubt that it made its determination on the basis of “ ‘[t]he\ntestimony’ ” that the State had presented. 491 Mich., at 8,\n810 N. W. 2d, at 539. This ruling was not a dismissal on\na procedural ground “unrelated to factual guilt or inno-\ncence,” like the question of “preindictment delay” in Scott,\nbut rather a determination that the State had failed to\nprove its case. 437 U. S., at 98, 99. Under our precedents,\nthen, Evans was acquitted.\n   There is no question the trial court’s ruling was wrong;\nit was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what\nfacts the State needed to prove under State law. But that\nis of no moment. Martin Linen, Sanabria, Rumsey,\nSmalis, and Smith all instruct that an acquittal due to\ninsufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court’s\nevaluation of the evidence was “correct or not,” Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571, and regardless of whether the\ncourt’s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling\nof law. Here Evans’ acquittal was the product of an “erro-\nneous interpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,” but\nas in our other cases, that error affects only “the accuracy\nof [the] determination” to acquit, not “its essential charac-\nter.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 98 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The court below saw things differently. It identified a\n“constitutionally meaningful difference” between this case\nand our previous decisions. Those cases, the court found,\n“involve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed\nto establish a factual element of the . . . crimes at issue,”\nbut still ultimately involved “a resolution regarding the\nsufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.”\n491 Mich., at 14–15, 810 N. W. 2d, at 542–543. When a\ncourt mistakenly “identifie[s] an extraneous element and\ndismisse[s] the case solely on that basis,” however, it has\n“not resolve[d] or even address[ed] any factual element\nnecessary to establish” the offense. Id., at 15, 20, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 543, 546. As a result, the court below rea-\nsoned, the case terminates “based on an error of law\nunrelated to [the] defendant’s guilt or innocence on the ele-\nments of the charged offense,” and thus falls outside the\ndefinition of an acquittal. Id., at 21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546.\n   We fail to perceive the difference. This case, like our\nprevious ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led\nto an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact\nit was not actually required to prove. Consider Rumsey.\nThere the trial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case\ninvolving a murder committed during a robbery, mistak-\nenly held that Arizona’s statutory aggravating factor\ndescribing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to mur-\nders for hire. Accordingly, it found the State had failed to\nprove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. After the State success-\nfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand,\nwe held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a\ndouble jeopardy violation.4\n——————\n  4 Under Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), a capital de-\n\nfendant is “acquitted” of the death penalty if, at the end of a separate\nsentencing proceeding, the factfinder concludes that the prosecution\n8                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  The only relevant difference between that situation and\nthis one is that in Rumsey the trial court’s error was called\na “misinterpretation” and a “misconstruction of the stat-\nute,” 467 U. S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error has\nbeen designated the “erroneous addition of [an] extraneous\nelement to the charged offense.” 491 Mich., at 3–4, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 536. But we have emphasized that labels do\nnot control our analysis in this context; rather, the sub-\nstance of a court’s decision does. See Smalis, 476 U. S.,\nat 144, n. 5; Scott, 437 U. S., at 96–97; Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 571. The error in Rumsey could just as easily\nhave been characterized as the erroneous addition of an\nelement of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that\nthe homicide be a murder-for-hire. Conversely, the error\nhere could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the stat-\nute’s phrase “building or other real property” to exclude\ndwellings.5 This is far too fine a distinction to be meaning-\n——————\nhas failed to prove required additional facts to support a sentence of\ndeath. Thus in Rumsey, the trial court’s initial “judgment, based on\nfindings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence,\namounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars any retrial of\nthe appropriateness of the death penalty.” 467 U. S., at 211.\n   5 Indeed, it is possible that this is what the trial court thought it was\n\ndoing, not articulating an additional element. The statute criminalizes\nburning “any building or other real property, . . . other than those\nspecified in” the previous section, which criminalizes the burning of a\ndwelling house. Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73. In light of the statute’s\nphrasing, the trial court interpreted “building or other real property” to\nbe exclusive of the type of property described in §750.72, although the\nMichigan courts have explained that the term is actually meant to be\ninclusive. So the trial court decision could be viewed as having given\nthe statutory “building” element an unduly narrow construction (by\nlimiting it to nondwellings), just as the trial court in Rumsey gave the\npecuniary-gain provision an unduly narrow construction (by limiting it\nto contract killings). Nevertheless, we accept the parties’ and the\nMichigan courts’ alternative characterization of the trial court’s error\nas the “addition” of an extraneous element. Our observation simply\nunderscores how malleable the distinction adopted by the Michigan\nSupreme Court, and defended by the State and the United States, can\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful, and we reject the notion that a defendant’s constitu-\ntional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an\nappellate court chooses to describe a trial court’s error.\n   Echoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State and the\nUnited States, as well as the dissent, emphasize Martin\nLinen’s description of an acquittal as the “resolution,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged.” 430 U. S., at 571 (emphasis added); see\nBrief for Respondent 11–17; see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11–15 (hereinafter U. S. Brief); see post, at\n6–8. They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause pro-\ntects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same\n“offence,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl. 2, and they note that\nan offense comprises constituent parts called elements,\nwhich are facts that must be proved to sustain a convic-\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696–\n697 (1993). Consequently, they argue, only if an actual\nelement of the offense is resolved can it be said that there\nhas been an acquittal of the offense, because “ ‘innocence of\nthe charged offense’ cannot turn on something that is\nconcededly not an element of the offense.” U. S. Brief 15.\nBecause Evans’ trial ended without resolution of even one\nactual element, they conclude, there was no acquittal.\n   This argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly, and it\nis inconsistent with our decisions since then. Our focus in\nMartin Linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal\nunder Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court in\nthat case had “evaluated the Government’s evidence and\ndetermined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-\nviction.” 430 U. S., at 572. That determination of noncul-\npability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury\nverdict; our holding did not depend upon defining the\n—————— \n\nbe. And it belies the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 11 (opinion of ALITO, \n\nJ.), that drawing this distinction is “quite easy” here, and that the basis\n\nfor the trial court’s ruling could not be subject to “real dispute.” \n\n10                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“elements” of the offense. As we have explained, supra,\nat 5–6, Scott confirms that the relevant distinction is\nbetween judicial determinations that go to “the criminal\ndefendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” and those that\nhold “that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may\nnot be punished because of a supposed” procedural error.\n437 U. S., at 98. Culpability (i.e., the “ultimate question of\nguilt or innocence”) is the touchstone, not whether any\nparticular elements were resolved or whether the deter-\nmination of nonculpability was legally correct. Id., at 98,\nn. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Perhaps most inconsistent with the State’s and United\nStates’ argument is Burks. There we held that when a\ndefendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides\nthe “Government ha[s] failed to come forward with suffi-\ncient proof of [the defendant’s] capacity to be responsible\nfor criminal acts,” the defendant has been acquitted be-\ncause the court decided that “criminal culpability ha[s] not\nbeen established.” 437 U. S., at 10. Lack of insanity was\nnot an “element” of Burks’ offense, bank robbery by use of\na dangerous weapon. See 18 U. S. C. §2113(d) (1976 ed.).\nRather, insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal\nliability. Our conclusion thus depended upon equating a\njudicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evi-\ndence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of any par-\nticular element of the offense.6\n——————\n  6 To  account for Burks, the United States posits that, “[a]s used in\n[its] brief, the ‘elements’ of an offense encompass legally recognized\ndefenses that would negate culpability.” U. S. Brief 11, n. 3. So too\nwould the dissent hold that, “as used in this opinion, the ‘elements’ of\nan offense include legally recognized affirmative defenses that would\nnegate culpability.” Post, at 8, n. 2. Rather than adopt a novel defini-\ntion of the word “element” to mean “elements and affirmative defenses,”\nand then promptly limit that novel definition to these circumstances,\nwe prefer to read Burks for what it says, which is that the issue is\nwhether the bottom-line question of “criminal culpability” was resolved.\n437 U. S., at 10.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the end, this case follows those that have come before\nit. The trial court’s judgment of acquittal resolved the\nquestion of Evans’ guilt or innocence as a matter of\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural\ngrounds. That judgment, “however erroneous” it was,\nprecludes reprosecution on this charge, and so should have\nbarred the State’s appeal as well. Sanabria, 437 U. S.,\nat 69.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   The State, supported by the United States, offers three\nother reasons why the distinction drawn by the court be-\nlow should be maintained. None persuades us.\n   To start, the State argues that unless an actual element\nof the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to\nknow whether the court’s ruling was an “acquittal” is to rely\nupon the label used by the court, which would wrongly\nallow the form of the trial court’s action to control. Brief\nfor Respondent 17–18, 21–22. We disagree. Our decision\nturns not on the form of the trial court’s action, but rather\nwhether it “serve[s]” substantive “purposes” or procedural\nones. Scott, 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11. If a trial court were\nto announce, midtrial, “The defendant shall be acquitted\nbecause he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,” the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause would pose no barrier to reprose-\ncution, notwithstanding the “acquittal” label. Cf. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82. Here we know the trial court acquitted\nEvans, not because it incanted the word “acquit” (which it\ndid not), but because it acted on its view that the prosecu-\ntion had failed to prove its case.\n   Next, the State and the United States fear that if the\ngrounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual\nelements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unre-\nviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for\nany reason at all, such as that the prosecution failed to\n12                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove “that the structure burned [was] blue.” Brief for\nRespondent 16–17; U. S. Brief 15. If the concern is that\nthere is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could\nyield an acquittal, the response is that we have long held\nas much. See supra, at 4. If the concern is instead that\nour holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from\nreview acquittals that are granted as a form of nullifi-\ncation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 58, we reject the\npremise. We presume here, as in other contexts, that\ncourts exercise their duties in good faith. Cf. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Finally, the State suggests that because Evans induced\nthe trial court’s error, he should not be heard to complain\nwhen that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry\nhim. Brief for Respondent 32–33; cf. id., at 5–9. But we\nhave recognized that “most [judgments of acquittal] re-\nsult from defense motions,” so “[t]o hold that a defendant\nwaives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial\ncourt error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an\nacquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on\nwhich our system of criminal justice rests, and would\nvitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the\nFifth Amendment.” Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 78 (citation\nomitted).7 It is true that when a defendant persuades the\ncourt to declare a mistrial, jeopardy continues and retrial\nis generally allowed. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S.\n600 (1976). But in such circumstances the defendant\nconsents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution,\nwhereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does\nnot. See Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 75.\n——————\n  7 The dissent says that “defense counsel fooled the judge,” post, at 6,\n\nbut surely that charge is not fair. Nothing suggests counsel exceeded\nthe permissible bounds of zealous advocacy on behalf of his client.\nCounsel presented a colorable legal argument, and marshaled persua-\nsive authority: Michigan’s own criminal jury instructions, which, at the\ntime, supported his position. See supra, at 2, 3, n. 2.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The United States makes a related argument. It con-\ntends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve\nwhether nondwelling status is an element of the offense\nbefore jeopardy attached, so having elected to wait until\ntrial was underway to raise the point, he cannot now claim\na double jeopardy violation. U. S. Brief 22–25. The Gov-\nernment relies upon Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23\n(1977), in which the District Court dismissed an indict-\nment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required\nintent element of the offense. We held that retrial on a\ncorrected indictment was not barred, because the dismis-\nsal was akin to a mistrial, not an acquittal. This was clear\nbecause the District Court had separately denied the\ndefendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, explaining\nthat the defendant “ ‘has been proven [guilty] beyond any\nreasonable doubt in the world,’ ” while acknowledging that\nthe error in the indictment required dismissal. Id., at 26–\n27. Because the defendant “invited the court to interrupt\nthe proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits”\nby raising the indictment issue so late, we held the princi-\nples governing a defendant’s consent to mistrial should\napply. Id., at 28 (citing Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600).\n   The Government suggests the situation here is “func-\ntionally similar,” because “identifying the elements of an\noffense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency\nof a charging document.” U. S. Brief 23. But we can-\nnot ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did\nhere was rule on the sufficiency of the State’s proof, not\nthe sufficiency of the information filed against him. Lee\ndemonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.\nAnd even if the Government is correct that Evans could\nhave challenged the charging document on the same legal\ntheory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\nit matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion\nthat necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.\nEvans cannot be penalized for requesting from the court a\n14                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nruling on the merits of the State’s case, as the Michigan\nRules entitled him to do; whether he could have also\nbrought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside\nthe point.\n                             B\n  In the alternative, the State and the United States ask\nus to reconsider our past decisions. Brief for Respondent\n34–56 (suggesting overruling our cases since at least\nFong Foo); U. S. Brief 27–32 (suggesting overruling Smith,\nRumsey, and Smalis).8 We declined to revisit our cases\nwhen the United States made a similar request in Smalis.\n476 U. S., at 144; see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae in Smalis v. Pennsylvania, O. T. 1985, No. 85–227,\npp. 19–25. And we decline to do so here.\n  First, we have no reason to believe the existing rules\nhave become so “unworkable” as to justify overruling\nprecedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).\nThe distinction drawn in Scott has stood the test of time,\nand we expect courts will continue to have little “difficulty\nin distinguishing between those rulings which relate to\nthe ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those\nwhich serve other purposes.” 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., United States\nv. Dionisio, 503 F. 3d 78, 83–88 (CA2 2007) (collecting\ncases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Crimi-\nnal Procedure §25.3(a), p. 629 (3d ed. 2007) (same).\n  Second, the logic of these cases still holds. There is no\n\n——————\n  8 The dissent’s true gripe may be with these cases as well, rather than\nour result here, which, we have explained, follows inevitably from\nthem. See post, at 5 (noting “how far [our cases] have departed from\nthe common-law principles that applied at the time of the founding”);\ncompare post, at 12 (“Permitting retrial in these egregious cases is\nespecially appropriate”), with Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141,\n143 (1962) (per curiam) (according finality to even those acquittals\n“based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes retrial,\nand thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led\nto that acquittal. See Ball, 163 U. S., at 671. So, had the\ntrial court here instructed the jury that it must find the\nburned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict,\nthe jury would have acquitted Evans accordingly; “ ‘[a] jury\nis presumed to follow its instructions.’ ” Blueford v. Ar-\nkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (quoting\nWeeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000)). And that\nwould have been the end of the matter. From that prem-\nise, Fong Foo’s holding follows: If a trial court instead\nexercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict\nof acquittal, jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any\nlegal error, because there too it is the jury that returns an\nacquittal. And from there, Martin Linen’s conclusion is\nunavoidable: It should make no difference whether the\ncourt employs the formality of directing the jury to return\nan acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal\nitself. Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith merely apply\nFong Foo and Martin Linen in tandem: If a trial court\nmakes an antecedent legal error (as in Fong Foo), and\nthen grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing\nthe jury to acquit (as in Martin Linen), the result is an\nacquittal all the same.\n   In other words, there is no way for antecedent legal\nerrors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals\nunless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise\nto jury acquittals (contrary to the settled understanding\nthat a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless\nwe distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to\ntheir instructions and judicial acquittals (notwithstand-\ning that this is a purely formal distinction). Neither op-\ntion has become more attractive with time. We therefore\nreiterate: “any contention that the Double Jeopardy\nClause must itself . . . leave open a way of correcting legal\nerrors is at odds with the well-established rule that the\n16                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently\nwrong in law.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 473.\n   Finally, the State and the United States object that this\nrule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity\nto present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant\nreaps a “windfall” from the trial court’s unreviewable error.\nBrief for Respondent 6; U. S. Brief 31–32. But sovereigns\nare hardly powerless to prevent this sort of situation, as\nwe observed in Smith, 543 U. S., at 474. Nothing obligates\na jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a\nmidtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the\npractice. See Nev. Rev. Stat. §175.381(1) (2011); State v.\nParfait, 96, 1814 (La. App. 1 Cir. 05/09/97), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135948\"><a href=\"/lactapp/6PFj/state-v-parfait/\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1232</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1242. Many jurisdictions, including the federal\nsystem, allow or encourage their courts to defer considera-\ntion of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a\nverdict, which mitigates double jeopardy concerns.9 See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b). And for cases such as this, in\nwhich a trial court’s interpretation of the relevant criminal\nstatute is likely to prove dispositive, we see no reason why\njurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances\nor expedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to pre-\nvent misguided acquittals from being entered.10 But\nhaving chosen to vest its courts with the power to grant\nmidtrial acquittals, the State must bear the corresponding\nrisk that some acquittals will be granted in error.\n\n——————\n  9 If a court grants a motion to acquit after the jury has convicted,\n\nthere is no double jeopardy barrier to an appeal by the government\nfrom the court’s acquittal, because reversal would result in reinstate-\nment of the jury verdict of guilt, not a new trial. United States v.\nWilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975).\n  10 Here, the prosecutor twice asked the court for a recess to review the\n\nMichigan statutes and to discuss the question with her supervisor. 491\nMich., at 7, 810 N. W. 2d, at 538–539.

The Court’s\ndecision makes no sense. It is not consistent with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause; it does\nnot serve the purposes of the prohibition against double\njeopardy; and contrary to the Court’s reasoning, the trial\njudge’s ruling was not an “acquittal,” which our cases have\n“consistently” defined as a decision that “ ‘actually repre-\nsents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the\nfactual elements of the offense charged.’ ” E.g., Smith v.\nMassachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 468 (2005) (quoting United\nStates v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571\n(1977); emphasis added). For no good reason, the Court\ndeprives the State of Michigan of its right to have one fair\nopportunity to convict petitioner, and I therefore respect-\nfully dissent.\n                             I\n  After Detroit police officers heard an explosion at a\nburning house, they observed petitioner running away\nfrom the building with a gasoline can.

No one was living\nin the house at the time of the fire.\n    If the house in question had been a “dwelling house,”\npetitioner could have been charged under Mich. Comp.\nLaws §750.72 (1981) for burning a dwelling, an offense\npunishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. But peti-\ntioner was instead charged with “[b]urning other real\nproperty” in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73. This\noffense, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’\nimprisonment, applies to “[a]ny person who wilfully or\nmaliciously burns any building or other real property . . .\nother than those specified in [§750.72].” This crime is a\nlesser included offense of the crime of burning a dwelling\nhouse. The “necessary elements to prove either offense\nare the same, except to prove the greater [offense] it must\nbe shown that the building is a dwelling.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n19–20, 810 N.

W. 2d, at 546 (emphasis\nadded).\n    At the close of the prosecution’s case, petitioner’s attor-\nney moved for a directed verdict on the ground that (1) the\nprosecution was required to prove, as an “element” of\nthe charged offense, that “the building was not a dwelling”\nand (2) “the prosecution had failed to prove that the\nburned building was not a dwelling house.” Id., at 5, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 537.

The Michigan Court of Appeals\nagreed with this concession and went on to hold that\nthe trial judge’s ruling did not constitute an “acquittal” for\ndouble jeopardy purposes because the ruling did not rep-\nresent “a resolution in the defendant’s favor . . . of a fac-\ntual element necessary for a criminal conviction.” Id., at\n421–422, 794 N. W. 2d, at 856 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed, holding\nthat when, as here, a trial judge erroneously adds an ex-\ntra “element” to a charged offense and subsequently de-\ntermines that the prosecution did not prove that extra\n“element,” the trial judge’s decision is not based on the de-\nfendant’s guilt or innocence of the elements of the charged\noffense. 491 Mich., at 3–4, 19–21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536–\n537, 545–546. Accordingly, the Michigan Supreme Court\nconcluded that the judge’s ruling in this case “does not\nconstitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy\nand retrial is . . . not barred.” Id., at 4, 810 N.

MICHIGAN\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                             A\n  The prohibition against double jeopardy “had its origin\nin the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autre-\nfois convict, and pardon,” which “prevented the retrial of a\nperson who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or\npardoned for the same offense.” United States v. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82, 87 (1978); see Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28,\n33 (1978). As the Court has previously explained, “the\ncommon-law protection against double jeopardy historically\napplied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a\nverdict.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 466 (emphasis added).1 As a\nresult, the original understanding of the Clause, which is\n“hardly a matter of dispute,” Scott, supra, at 87, does not\ncompel the Court’s conclusion that a defendant is acquit-\nted for double jeopardy purposes whenever a judge issues\na preverdict ruling that the prosecution has failed to prove\na nonexistent “element” of the charged offense.\n  Although our decisions have expanded double jeopardy\nprotection beyond its common-law origins, see, e.g., Smith,\nsupra, at 466–467 (acknowledging the Court’s expansion\nof “the common-law protection against double jeopardy”);\n\n——————\n   1 See also Crist, 437 U.

S., at 96. And given how far we have depart-\ned from the common-law principles that applied at the\ntime of the founding, we should at least ensure that our\ndecisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the\nconstitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See\nid., at 95–96, 100–101. Yet today’s decision fails to ad-\nvance the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n                              B\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause is largely based on “the\ndeeply ingrained principle that the State with all its re-\nsources and power should not be allowed to make repeated\nattempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and or-\ndeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil-\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.”\nYeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 117–118 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Blueford v.\nArkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5); Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 569. Allowing retrial in the circum-\nstances of the present case would not result in any such\nabuse. The prosecution would not be afforded a second\nopportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence\nsatisfies the actual elements of the offense. Instead, be-\ncause the trial judge’s ruling in the first trial was not\nbased on an actual element of the charged offense, retrial\nwould simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to\nprove its case.\n   Allowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecu-\ntors “to make repeated attempts to convict an individual\nfor an alleged offense,” Yeager, supra, at 117. It was\n6                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npetitioner, not the prosecutor, who sought to terminate the\ntrial prior to verdict. Thus, contrary to the Court’s unex-\nplained suggestion, see ante, at 5–6, “[t]his case hardly\npresents the specter of ‘an all-powerful state relentlessly\npursuing a defendant who had either been found not\nguilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of\nguilt submitted to the first trier of fact.’ ” Sattazahn v.\nPennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, 114–115 (2003) (quoting\nScott, supra, at 96). On the contrary, this is a case in\nwhich defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an\nerror that provided his client with an undeserved benefit,\nthe termination of a trial that the defense obviously did\nnot want to run to completion. The Double Jeopardy\nClause does not require that the defense receive an even\ngreater benefit, the protection provided by an acquittal.\n   As this Court has repeatedly emphasized in double\njeopardy cases, a State has an interest in receiving “one\ncomplete opportunity to convict those who have violated\nits laws,” Sattazahn, supra, at 115 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Scott, supra, at 100, but today’s decision\ndeprives the State of Michigan of this valuable right.\n                             C\n   The Court’s decision also flies in the face of our estab-\nlished understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nprovides that no person shall “be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added).          Thus, “[d]ouble-\njeopardy analysis focuses on the individual ‘offence’\ncharged.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 469, n. 3. And to determine\nwhat constitutes “the individual ‘offence’ charged,” ibid.,\nthe Court homes in on the elements of the offense. See\nUnited States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993) (“In both\nthe multiple punishment and multiple prosecution con-\ntexts, this Court has concluded that where the two of-\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Consistent with the constitutional text’s focus\non the “offence”—and thus the elements—with which a\ndefendant is charged, the Court’s “double-jeopardy cases\nhave consistently” defined an acquittal as a decision that\n“ ‘actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some\nor all of the factual elements of the offense charged.’ ”\nSmith, supra, at 468 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at\n571); see also Scott, supra, at 97 (“[A] defendant is acquit-\nted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,\nactually represents a resolution in the defendant’s favor,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged” (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n    Today, the Court effectively abandons the well-\nestablished definition of an acquittal. Indeed, in the face\nof our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeop-\nardy purposes requires a “resolution, correct or not, of\nsome or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,”\nSmith, supra, at 468; Martin Linen, supra, at 571; see\nalso Scott, supra, at 97, the Court now declares that “the\ntouchstone [is] not whether any particular elements were\nresolved,” ante, at 10 (emphasis added). Instead, the\nCourt proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a\nmidtrial termination represented a “procedural dismissa[l]”\nor a “substantive rulin[g],” ante, at 5. This reformulation\nof double jeopardy law is not faithful to our prece-\ndents—or to the Double Jeopardy Clause itself. The key\nquestion is not whether a ruling is “procedural” or “sub-\nstantive” (whatever those terms mean in this context), but\nwhether a ruling relates to the defendant’s factual guilt or\ninnocence with respect to the “offence,” see U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 5—and thus the elements—with which he is\ncharged. See Scott, supra, at 87, 97–99, and n. 11.\n    When a judge evaluates the evidence and determines\n8                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally\nsufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged\noffense, the ruling, however labeled, represents an acquit-\ntal because it is founded on the defendant’s factual inno-\ncence. See Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 572. But when a\njudge manufactures an additional “element” of an offense\nand then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove\nthat extra “element,” the judge has not resolved the de-\nfendant’s “factual guilt or innocence” as to any of the\nactual elements of the offense.2 Thus, the ruling, no mat-\nter what the judge calls it, does not acquit the defendant of\nthe offense with which he is charged. No acquittal occurs\nwhen a criminal trial is terminated “on a basis unrelated\nto factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which [a\ndefendant] is accused.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 87, 94–95, 98–\n99. “[I]n a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately\nchoosing to seek termination of the proceedings against\nhim on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of\nthe offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cog-\nnizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Govern-\nment is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial\ncourt in favor of the defendant.” Id., at 98–99 (reasoning\nthat, in such a case, the defendant was “neither acquitted\nnor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook\nto persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt\nor innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try\nhim”).\n\n\n\n——————\n   2 Because culpability for an offense can be negated by proof of an\n\naffirmative defense, the Court has held that a ruling that the prosecu-\ntion did not submit sufficient evidence to rebut an affirmative defense\nconstitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. See Burks v.\nUnited States, 437 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1978); Scott, 437 U. S., at 97–98.\nThus, as used in this opinion, the “elements” of an offense include\nlegally recognized affirmative defenses that would negate culpability.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   Contrary to the Court’s opinion, its decision in this case\nis not supported by prior precedent. In all three of the\nprincipal cases on which the Court relies—Smalis v. Penn-\nsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986); Smith, 543 U. S. 462; and\nArizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203 (1984)—trial judges\nruled that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof the offenses in question. In none of these cases (and in\nnone of our other double jeopardy cases) did a trial judge\nterminate a prosecution before verdict based on an ele-\nment of the judge’s own creation.\n   The first two cases, Smalis and Smith, involved gar-\nden variety preverdict acquittals, i.e., rulings based on the\nground that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof an offense. (Using conventional modern terminology,\nRule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nexplicitly labels such rulings “acquittal[s].”)\n   In Smalis, the judge, at the close of the prosecution’s\ncase in chief, granted a demurrer with respect to certain\ncharges on the ground that the evidence regarding those\ncharges was “legally insufficient to support a conviction.”\n476 U. S., at 141. The State Supreme Court held that this\nruling was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes\nbecause it was based on a legal determination (i.e., that\nthe evidence was not sufficient) rather than a factual\nfinding, but we rejected that distinction. Id., at 143–144.\nSee also Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 71–72\n(1978).\n   Smith involved a similar situation. There, one of the\nelements of a firearms offense with which the defendant\nwas charged required proof that the gun “had a barrel ‘less\nthan 16 inches’ in length,” 543 U. S., at 464, and the trial\njudge dismissed this charge before verdict on the ground\nthat the prosecution had not introduced sufficient evi-\n10                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndence to establish this undisputed element, id., at 464–\n465. Before the remaining charges were submitted to the\njury, however, the judge reversed this ruling and allowed\nthe charge to go to the jury. Id., at 465. We held, how-\never, that the judge’s prior ruling constituted an acquittal\nand therefore barred the defendant’s conviction for this\noffense. Id., at 467–469. Thus, both Smalis and Smith\ninvolved rulings that were very different from the one at\nissue here. In both of those earlier cases, the trial judges\nheld that the evidence was insufficient to prove undis-\nputed elements of the offenses in question. In neither case\ndid the judge invent a new element.\n   The final case, Rumsey, differs from Smalis and Smith\nin only one particular. Like Smalis and Smith, Rumsey\ninvolved a ruling that the prosecution’s evidence was in-\nsufficient to prove an element, but in Rumsey the ruling\nwas predicated on a misconstruction of an element. In\nthat case, after the defendant was found guilty of first-\ndegree murder, the “trial judge, with no jury, . . . con-\nducted a separate sentencing hearing” at which he deter-\nmined that no aggravating circumstances were present. 467\nU. S., at 205. In particular, the judge found that the\nprosecution had not proved that the murder had been\ncommitted “ ‘as consideration for the receipt, or in expecta-\ntion of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.’ ” Id., at\n205–206 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–703(F)(5)\n(Supp. 1983–1984)). The judge reached this conclusion\nbecause, in his (incorrect) view, that aggravating circum-\nstance was limited to contract killings. 467 U. S., at 205–\n206. Holding that the judge’s ruling constituted an acquit-\ntal on the merits of the question whether a death sentence\nwas appropriate, we noted that the ruling rested on “a\nmisconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain\naggravating circumstance.” Id., at 211. Accordingly, the\nruling was based on a determination that there was insuf-\nficient evidence to prove a real element; it was not based\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non the judicial invention of an extra “element.” And for\nthat reason, it does not support the nonsensical result that\nthe Court reaches today.\n   The Court may feel compelled to reach that result be-\ncause it thinks that it would be unworkable to draw a\ndistinction between a preverdict termination based on the\ntrial judge’s misconstruction of an element of an offense\nand a preverdict termination based on the judge’s percep-\ntion that a statute contains an “element” that is actually\nnonexistent. This practical concern is overblown. There\nmay be cases in which this determination presents prob-\nlems, but surely there are many cases in which the de-\ntermination is quite easy. The present case is a perfect\nexample, for here there is no real dispute that the trial\njudge’s ruling was based on a nonexistent statutory “ele-\nment.” As noted, defense counsel conceded on appeal that\nthe judge had “wrongly added an extraneous element to\nthe statute” under which his client was charged. 491\nMich., at 3, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536.\n   Another good example is provided by State v. Korsen,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595006\"><a href=\"/idaho/eipu/state-v-korsen/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 69 P. 3d 126 (2003), where a Magistrate\nerroneously concluded that the offense of criminal trespass\nunder Idaho law requires a showing that the defendant\ndid something to justify the property owner’s request for\nthe defendant to leave the premises.

MICHIGAN\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MICHIGAN\n\n No. 11–1327. Argued November 6, 2012—Decided February 20, 2013\nAfter the State of Michigan rested its case at petitioner Evans’ arson\n  trial, the court granted Evans’ motion for a directed verdict of acquit-\n  tal, concluding that the State had failed to prove that the burned\n  building was not a dwelling, a fact the court mistakenly believed was\n  an “element” of the statutory offense. The State Court of Appeals re-\n  versed and remanded for retrial. In affirming, the State Supreme\n  Court held that a directed verdict based on an error of law that did\n  not resolve a factual element of the charged offense was not an ac-\n  quittal for double jeopardy purposes.\nHeld: The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial for Evans’ offense.\n Pp. 4−17.\n    (a) Retrial following a court-decreed acquittal is barred, even if the\n acquittal is “based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation,” Fong\n Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143, such as an erroneous deci-\n sion to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54,\n 68−69; a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to\n sustain a conviction, Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 473; or a\n “misconstruction of the statute” defining the requirements to convict,\n Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 303, 211. Most relevant here, an ac-\n quittal encompasses any ruling that the prosecution’s proof is insuffi-\n cient to establish criminal liability for an offense. See, e.g., United\n States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n 10. In contrast to procedural rulings, which lead to dismissals or\n mistrials on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, acquittals\n are substantive rulings that conclude proceedings absolutely, and\n thus raise significant double jeopardy concerns. Scott, 437 U. S., at\n 91. Here, the trial court clearly “evaluated the [State’s] evidence and\n determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.”\n United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 572. Evans’\n2                          EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acquittal was the product of an erroneous interpretation of governing\n    legal principles, but that error affects only the accuracy of the deter-\n    mination to acquit, not its essential character. See Scott, 437 U. S.,\n    at 98. Pp. 4−6.\n       (b) The State Supreme Court attempted to distinguish this Court’s\n    cases on the ground that they involved “the sufficiency of the factual\n    elements of the charged offense,” while Evans’ case concerned “an er-\n    ror of law unrelated to [his] guilt or innocence,” but this Court per-\n    ceives no such difference. This case, like the Court’s previous ones,\n    involves an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because\n    the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove.\n    The State and the United States claim that only when an actual ele-\n    ment of the offense is resolved can there be an acquittal of the of-\n    fense, but Evans’ verdict was based on something that was conceded-\n    ly not an element. Their argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly\n    and is inconsistent with this Court’s decisions since then. Martin\n    Linen focused on the significance of the District Court’s acquittal\n    based on a nonculpability determination, and its result did not de-\n    pend on defining the “elements” of the offense. Culpability is the\n    touchstone, not whether any particular elements were resolved or\n    whether the nonculpability determination was legally correct. Scott,\n    437 U. S., at 98. Pp. 7−11.\n       (c) Additional arguments the State and the United States raise in\n    support of the lower court’s distinction are unpersuasive. The State\n    claims that unless an actual element of the offense is resolved by the\n    trial court, the only way to know whether the court’s ruling was an\n    “acquittal” is to rely upon the court’s label, which would wrongly al-\n    low the form of the trial court’s action to control. However, the in-\n    stant decision turns not on the form of the trial court’s action but on\n    whether that action serves substantive or procedural purposes. The\n    State and the United States argue that if the grounds for an acquittal\n    are untethered from the actual elements of the offense, a trial court\n    could issue an unreviewable order finding insufficient evidence to\n    convict for any reason at all. But this Court presumes that courts ex-\n    ercise their duties in good faith. The State also suggests that Evans\n    should not be heard to complain when a trial-court error that he in-\n    duced is corrected and the State wishes to retry him, but most mid-\n    trial acquittals result from defense motions. The United States\n    claims that, under Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, Evans was re-\n    quired to ask the court to resolve whether nondwelling status was an\n    element of the offense before jeopardy attached. However, Lee in-\n    volved a midtrial dismissal that was akin to a mistrial, while this\n    case involves a ruling on the sufficiency of the State’s proof.\n    Pp. 11−14.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

And the logic of those cases still holds. As for the objection\n  that the rule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity to\n  present its evidence to the jury while the defendant reaps a “wind-\n  fall” from the trial court’s unreviewable error, sovereigns have power\n  to prevent such situations by disallowing the practice of midtrial ac-\n  quittals, encouraging courts to defer consideration of a motion to ac-\n  quit until after the jury renders a verdict, or providing for mandatory\n  continuances or expedited interlocutory appeals.

It turns out that the unproven “element”\nwas not actually a required element at all. We must de-\ncide whether an erroneous acquittal such as this neverthe-\nless constitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes,\nwhich would mean that Evans could not be retried. This\nCourt has previously held that a judicial acquittal prem-\nised upon a “misconstruction” of a criminal statute is an\n“acquittal on the merits . . . [that] bars retrial.” Arizona v.\nRumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 211 (1984). Seeing no meaningful\nconstitutional distinction between a trial court’s “miscon-\nstruction” of a statute and its erroneous addition of a\nstatutory element, we hold that a midtrial acquittal in\nthese circumstances is an acquittal for double jeopardy\npurposes as well.\n                            I\n  The State charged Evans with burning “other real prop-\nerty,” a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73 (1981).\n2                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nThe State’s evidence at trial suggested that Evans had\nburned down an unoccupied house. At the close of the\nState’s case, however, Evans moved for a directed ver-\ndict of acquittal. He pointed the court to the applicable\nMichigan Criminal Jury Instructions, which listed as the\n“Fourth” element of the offense “that the building was not\na dwelling house.” 3 Mich. Crim. Jury Instr. §31.3, p. 31–7\n(2d ed., Supp. 2006/2007). And the commentary to the\nInstructions emphasized, “an essential element is that\nthe structure burned is not a dwelling house.” Id., at\n31–8. Evans argued that Mich. Comp. Laws §750.72 criminal-\nizes common-law arson, which requires that the structure\nburned be a dwelling, while the provision under which he\nwas charged, §750.73, covers all other real property.1\nPersuaded, the trial court granted the motion. 491 Mich.\n1, 8, 810 N. W. 2d 535, 539 (2012). The court explained\nthat the “ ‘testimony [of the homeowner] was this was a\ndwelling house,’ ” so the nondwelling requirement of\n§750.73 was not met. Ibid.\n   On the State’s appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals\nreversed and remanded. 288 Mich. App. 410, 794 N. W. 2d\n848 (2010). Evans had conceded, and the court held, that\nunder controlling precedent, burning “other real property”\nis a lesser included offense under Michigan law, and dis-\n——————\n  1 Mich. Comp. Laws §750.72 (1981), “Burning dwelling house,” pro-\n\nvides: “Any person who wilfully or maliciously burns any dwelling\nhouse, either occupied or unoccupied, or the contents thereof, whether\nowned by himself or another, or any building within the curtilage of\nsuch dwelling house, or the contents thereof, shall be guilty of a felony,\npunishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 20\nyears.”\n  And §750.73, “Burning of other real property,” provides: “Any person\nwho wilfully or maliciously burns any building or other real property, or\nthe contents thereof, other than those specified in the next preceding\nsection of this chapter, the property of himself or another, shall be\nguilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for\nnot more than 10 years.”\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Antonelli, 66 Mich.\nApp. 138, 140, 238 N. W. 2d 551, 552 (1975) (on rehear-\ning)).2 The court thus explained it was “undisputed that\nthe trial court misperceived the elements of the offense\nwith which [Evans] was charged and erred by directing\na verdict.” 288 Mich. App., at 416, 794 N. W. 2d, at 852.\nBut the court rejected Evans’ argument that the Double\nJeopardy Clause barred retrial. Id., at 421–422, 794 N. W.\n2d, at 856.\n   In a divided decision, the Supreme Court of Michigan\naffirmed. It held that “when a trial court grants a defend-\nant’s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error\nof law that did not resolve any factual element of the\ncharged offense, the trial court’s ruling does not constitute\nan acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and re-\ntrial is therefore not barred.” 491 Mich., at 4, 810 N. W.\n2d, at 536–537.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement\namong state and federal courts on the question whether\nretrial is barred when a trial court grants an acquittal be-\ncause the prosecution had failed to prove an “element” of\nthe offense that, in actuality, it did not have to prove.3\n567 U. S. ___ (2012). We now reverse.\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 In other words, the pattern jury instructions were incorrect. The\n\nState later revised them. See 288 Mich. App. 410, 416, n. 3, 794 N. W.\n2d 848, 852, n. 3 (2010).\n  3 Compare 491 Mich. 1, 810 N. W. 2d 535 (2012) (case below), and\n\nState v.

MICHIGAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n    In answering this question, we do not write on a clean\nslate. Quite the opposite. It has been half a century since\nwe first recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\nretrial following a court-decreed acquittal, even if the ac-\nquittal is “based upon an egregiously erroneous founda-\ntion.” Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962)\n(per curiam). A mistaken acquittal is an acquittal none-\ntheless, and we have long held that “[a] verdict of acquittal\n. . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without\nputting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby vio-\nlating the Constitution.” United States v. Ball, 163 U. S.\n662, 671 (1896).\n    Our cases have applied Fong Foo’s principle broadly. An\nacquittal is unreviewable whether a judge directs a jury\nto return a verdict of acquittal, e.g., Fong Foo, 369 U. S.,\nat 143, or forgoes that formality by entering a judgment of\nacquittal herself. See Smith v. Massachusetts, 543 U. S.\n462, 467–468 (2005) (collecting cases). And an acquittal\nprecludes retrial even if it is premised upon an erroneous\ndecision to exclude evidence, Sanabria v. United States,\n437 U. S. 54, 68–69, 78 (1978); a mistaken understanding\nof what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction,\nSmith, 543 U. S., at 473; or a “misconstruction of the stat-\nute” defining the requirements to convict, Rumsey, 467\nU. S., at 203, 211; cf. Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S.\n140, 144–145, n. 7 (1986). In all these circumstances, “the\nfact that the acquittal may result from erroneous eviden-\ntiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing\nlegal principles affects the accuracy of that determination,\nbut it does not alter its essential character.” United States\nv. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 98 (1978) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n    Most relevant here, our cases have defined an acquittal\nto encompass any ruling that the prosecution’s proof is\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninsufficient to establish criminal liability for an offense.\nSee ibid., and n. 11; Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1,\n10 (1978); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430\nU. S. 564, 571 (1977). Thus an “acquittal” includes “a\nruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to\nconvict,” a “factual finding [that] necessarily establish[es]\nthe criminal defendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” and\nany other “rulin[g] which relate[s] to the ultimate question\nof guilt or innocence.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 91, 98, and n. 11\n(internal quotation marks omitted). These sorts of sub-\nstantive rulings stand apart from procedural rulings that\nmay also terminate a case midtrial, which we generally\nrefer to as dismissals or mistrials. Procedural dismissals\ninclude rulings on questions that “are unrelated to factual\nguilt or innocence,” but “which serve other purposes,”\nincluding “a legal judgment that a defendant, although\ncriminally culpable, may not be punished” because of some\nproblem like an error with the indictment. Id., at 98, and\nn. 11.\n   Both procedural dismissals and substantive rulings\nresult in an early end to trial, but we explained in Scott\nthat the double jeopardy consequences of each differ.\n“[T]he law attaches particular significance to an acquit-\ntal,” so a merits-related ruling concludes proceedings\nabsolutely. Id., at 91. This is because “[t]o permit a se-\ncond trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquit-\ntal may have been, would present an unacceptably high\nrisk that the Government, with its vastly superior re-\nsources, might wear down the defendant so that ‘even\nthough innocent he may be found guilty,’ ” ibid. (quoting\nGreen v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957)). And\nretrial following an acquittal would upset a defendant’s ex-\npectation of repose, for it would subject him to additional\n“embarrassment, expense and ordeal” while “compelling\nhim to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.”\nId., at 187. In contrast, a “termination of the proceedings\n6                    EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst [a defendant] on a basis unrelated to factual guilt\nor innocence of the offense of which he is accused,” 437\nU. S., at 98–99, i.e., some procedural ground, does not pose\nthe same concerns, because no expectation of finality\nattaches to a properly granted mistrial.\n   Here, “it is plain that the [trial court] . . . evaluated\nthe [State’s] evidence and determined that it was legally\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 572. The trial court granted Evans’ motion under\na rule that requires the court to “direct a verdict of acquit-\ntal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is\ninsufficient to support conviction.” Mich. Rule Crim. Proc.\n6.419(A) (2012). And the court’s oral ruling leaves no\ndoubt that it made its determination on the basis of “ ‘[t]he\ntestimony’ ” that the State had presented. 491 Mich., at 8,\n810 N. W. 2d, at 539. This ruling was not a dismissal on\na procedural ground “unrelated to factual guilt or inno-\ncence,” like the question of “preindictment delay” in Scott,\nbut rather a determination that the State had failed to\nprove its case. 437 U. S., at 98, 99. Under our precedents,\nthen, Evans was acquitted.\n   There is no question the trial court’s ruling was wrong;\nit was predicated upon a clear misunderstanding of what\nfacts the State needed to prove under State law. But that\nis of no moment. Martin Linen, Sanabria, Rumsey,\nSmalis, and Smith all instruct that an acquittal due to\ninsufficient evidence precludes retrial, whether the court’s\nevaluation of the evidence was “correct or not,” Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 571, and regardless of whether the\ncourt’s decision flowed from an incorrect antecedent ruling\nof law. Here Evans’ acquittal was the product of an “erro-\nneous interpretatio[n] of governing legal principles,” but\nas in our other cases, that error affects only “the accuracy\nof [the] determination” to acquit, not “its essential charac-\nter.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 98 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n   The court below saw things differently. It identified a\n“constitutionally meaningful difference” between this case\nand our previous decisions. Those cases, the court found,\n“involve[d] evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed\nto establish a factual element of the . . . crimes at issue,”\nbut still ultimately involved “a resolution regarding the\nsufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.”\n491 Mich., at 14–15, 810 N. W. 2d, at 542–543. When a\ncourt mistakenly “identifie[s] an extraneous element and\ndismisse[s] the case solely on that basis,” however, it has\n“not resolve[d] or even address[ed] any factual element\nnecessary to establish” the offense. Id., at 15, 20, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 543, 546. As a result, the court below rea-\nsoned, the case terminates “based on an error of law\nunrelated to [the] defendant’s guilt or innocence on the ele-\nments of the charged offense,” and thus falls outside the\ndefinition of an acquittal. Id., at 21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546.\n   We fail to perceive the difference. This case, like our\nprevious ones, involves an antecedent legal error that led\nto an acquittal because the State failed to prove some fact\nit was not actually required to prove. Consider Rumsey.\nThere the trial court, sitting as sentencer in a capital case\ninvolving a murder committed during a robbery, mistak-\nenly held that Arizona’s statutory aggravating factor\ndescribing killings for pecuniary gain was limited to mur-\nders for hire. Accordingly, it found the State had failed to\nprove the killing was for pecuniary gain and sentenced the\ndefendant to life imprisonment. After the State success-\nfully appealed and obtained a death sentence on remand,\nwe held that retrial on the penalty phase question was a\ndouble jeopardy violation.4\n——————\n  4 Under Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), a capital de-\n\nfendant is “acquitted” of the death penalty if, at the end of a separate\nsentencing proceeding, the factfinder concludes that the prosecution\n8                        EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n  The only relevant difference between that situation and\nthis one is that in Rumsey the trial court’s error was called\na “misinterpretation” and a “misconstruction of the stat-\nute,” 467 U. S., at 207, 211, whereas here the error has\nbeen designated the “erroneous addition of [an] extraneous\nelement to the charged offense.” 491 Mich., at 3–4, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 536. But we have emphasized that labels do\nnot control our analysis in this context; rather, the sub-\nstance of a court’s decision does. See Smalis, 476 U. S.,\nat 144, n. 5; Scott, 437 U. S., at 96–97; Martin Linen, 430\nU. S., at 571. The error in Rumsey could just as easily\nhave been characterized as the erroneous addition of an\nelement of the statutory aggravating circumstance: that\nthe homicide be a murder-for-hire. Conversely, the error\nhere could be viewed as a misinterpretation of the stat-\nute’s phrase “building or other real property” to exclude\ndwellings.5 This is far too fine a distinction to be meaning-\n——————\nhas failed to prove required additional facts to support a sentence of\ndeath. Thus in Rumsey, the trial court’s initial “judgment, based on\nfindings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence,\namounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars any retrial of\nthe appropriateness of the death penalty.” 467 U. S., at 211.\n   5 Indeed, it is possible that this is what the trial court thought it was\n\ndoing, not articulating an additional element. The statute criminalizes\nburning “any building or other real property, . . . other than those\nspecified in” the previous section, which criminalizes the burning of a\ndwelling house. Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73. In light of the statute’s\nphrasing, the trial court interpreted “building or other real property” to\nbe exclusive of the type of property described in §750.72, although the\nMichigan courts have explained that the term is actually meant to be\ninclusive. So the trial court decision could be viewed as having given\nthe statutory “building” element an unduly narrow construction (by\nlimiting it to nondwellings), just as the trial court in Rumsey gave the\npecuniary-gain provision an unduly narrow construction (by limiting it\nto contract killings). Nevertheless, we accept the parties’ and the\nMichigan courts’ alternative characterization of the trial court’s error\nas the “addition” of an extraneous element. Our observation simply\nunderscores how malleable the distinction adopted by the Michigan\nSupreme Court, and defended by the State and the United States, can\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nful, and we reject the notion that a defendant’s constitu-\ntional rights would turn on the happenstance of how an\nappellate court chooses to describe a trial court’s error.\n   Echoing the Michigan Supreme Court, the State and the\nUnited States, as well as the dissent, emphasize Martin\nLinen’s description of an acquittal as the “resolution,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged.” 430 U. S., at 571 (emphasis added); see\nBrief for Respondent 11–17; see Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 11–15 (hereinafter U. S. Brief); see post, at\n6–8. They observe that the Double Jeopardy Clause pro-\ntects against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same\n“offence,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, cl. 2, and they note that\nan offense comprises constituent parts called elements,\nwhich are facts that must be proved to sustain a convic-\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696–\n697 (1993). Consequently, they argue, only if an actual\nelement of the offense is resolved can it be said that there\nhas been an acquittal of the offense, because “ ‘innocence of\nthe charged offense’ cannot turn on something that is\nconcededly not an element of the offense.” U. S. Brief 15.\nBecause Evans’ trial ended without resolution of even one\nactual element, they conclude, there was no acquittal.\n   This argument reads Martin Linen too narrowly, and it\nis inconsistent with our decisions since then. Our focus in\nMartin Linen was on the significance of a judicial acquittal\nunder Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court in\nthat case had “evaluated the Government’s evidence and\ndetermined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a con-\nviction.” 430 U. S., at 572. That determination of noncul-\npability was enough to make the acquittal akin to a jury\nverdict; our holding did not depend upon defining the\n—————— \n\nbe. And it belies the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 11 (opinion of ALITO, \n\nJ.), that drawing this distinction is “quite easy” here, and that the basis\n\nfor the trial court’s ruling could not be subject to “real dispute.” \n\n10                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n“elements” of the offense. As we have explained, supra,\nat 5–6, Scott confirms that the relevant distinction is\nbetween judicial determinations that go to “the criminal\ndefendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” and those that\nhold “that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may\nnot be punished because of a supposed” procedural error.\n437 U. S., at 98. Culpability (i.e., the “ultimate question of\nguilt or innocence”) is the touchstone, not whether any\nparticular elements were resolved or whether the deter-\nmination of nonculpability was legally correct. Id., at 98,\nn. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Perhaps most inconsistent with the State’s and United\nStates’ argument is Burks. There we held that when a\ndefendant raises insanity as a defense, and a court decides\nthe “Government ha[s] failed to come forward with suffi-\ncient proof of [the defendant’s] capacity to be responsible\nfor criminal acts,” the defendant has been acquitted be-\ncause the court decided that “criminal culpability ha[s] not\nbeen established.” 437 U. S., at 10. Lack of insanity was\nnot an “element” of Burks’ offense, bank robbery by use of\na dangerous weapon. See 18 U. S. C. §2113(d) (1976 ed.).\nRather, insanity was an affirmative defense to criminal\nliability. Our conclusion thus depended upon equating a\njudicial acquittal with an order finding insufficient evi-\ndence of culpability, not insufficient evidence of any par-\nticular element of the offense.6\n——————\n  6 To  account for Burks, the United States posits that, “[a]s used in\n[its] brief, the ‘elements’ of an offense encompass legally recognized\ndefenses that would negate culpability.” U. S. Brief 11, n. 3. So too\nwould the dissent hold that, “as used in this opinion, the ‘elements’ of\nan offense include legally recognized affirmative defenses that would\nnegate culpability.” Post, at 8, n. 2. Rather than adopt a novel defini-\ntion of the word “element” to mean “elements and affirmative defenses,”\nand then promptly limit that novel definition to these circumstances,\nwe prefer to read Burks for what it says, which is that the issue is\nwhether the bottom-line question of “criminal culpability” was resolved.\n437 U. S., at 10.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   In the end, this case follows those that have come before\nit. The trial court’s judgment of acquittal resolved the\nquestion of Evans’ guilt or innocence as a matter of\nthe sufficiency of the evidence, not on unrelated procedural\ngrounds. That judgment, “however erroneous” it was,\nprecludes reprosecution on this charge, and so should have\nbarred the State’s appeal as well. Sanabria, 437 U. S.,\nat 69.\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   The State, supported by the United States, offers three\nother reasons why the distinction drawn by the court be-\nlow should be maintained. None persuades us.\n   To start, the State argues that unless an actual element\nof the offense is resolved by the trial court, the only way to\nknow whether the court’s ruling was an “acquittal” is to rely\nupon the label used by the court, which would wrongly\nallow the form of the trial court’s action to control. Brief\nfor Respondent 17–18, 21–22. We disagree. Our decision\nturns not on the form of the trial court’s action, but rather\nwhether it “serve[s]” substantive “purposes” or procedural\nones. Scott, 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11. If a trial court were\nto announce, midtrial, “The defendant shall be acquitted\nbecause he was prejudiced by preindictment delay,” the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause would pose no barrier to reprose-\ncution, notwithstanding the “acquittal” label. Cf. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82. Here we know the trial court acquitted\nEvans, not because it incanted the word “acquit” (which it\ndid not), but because it acted on its view that the prosecu-\ntion had failed to prove its case.\n   Next, the State and the United States fear that if the\ngrounds for an acquittal are untethered from the actual\nelements of the offense, a trial court could issue an unre-\nviewable order finding insufficient evidence to convict for\nany reason at all, such as that the prosecution failed to\n12                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprove “that the structure burned [was] blue.” Brief for\nRespondent 16–17; U. S. Brief 15. If the concern is that\nthere is no limit to the magnitude of the error that could\nyield an acquittal, the response is that we have long held\nas much. See supra, at 4. If the concern is instead that\nour holding will make it easier for courts to insulate from\nreview acquittals that are granted as a form of nullifi-\ncation, see Brief for Respondent 30, n. 58, we reject the\npremise. We presume here, as in other contexts, that\ncourts exercise their duties in good faith. Cf. Harrington\nv. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).\n   Finally, the State suggests that because Evans induced\nthe trial court’s error, he should not be heard to complain\nwhen that error is corrected and the State wishes to retry\nhim. Brief for Respondent 32–33; cf. id., at 5–9. But we\nhave recognized that “most [judgments of acquittal] re-\nsult from defense motions,” so “[t]o hold that a defendant\nwaives his double jeopardy protection whenever a trial\ncourt error in his favor on a midtrial motion leads to an\nacquittal would undercut the adversary assumption on\nwhich our system of criminal justice rests, and would\nvitiate one of the fundamental rights established by the\nFifth Amendment.” Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 78 (citation\nomitted).7 It is true that when a defendant persuades the\ncourt to declare a mistrial, jeopardy continues and retrial\nis generally allowed. See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S.\n600 (1976). But in such circumstances the defendant\nconsents to a disposition that contemplates reprosecution,\nwhereas when a defendant moves for acquittal he does\nnot. See Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 75.\n——————\n  7 The dissent says that “defense counsel fooled the judge,” post, at 6,\n\nbut surely that charge is not fair. Nothing suggests counsel exceeded\nthe permissible bounds of zealous advocacy on behalf of his client.\nCounsel presented a colorable legal argument, and marshaled persua-\nsive authority: Michigan’s own criminal jury instructions, which, at the\ntime, supported his position. See supra, at 2, 3, n. 2.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The United States makes a related argument. It con-\ntends that Evans could have asked the court to resolve\nwhether nondwelling status is an element of the offense\nbefore jeopardy attached, so having elected to wait until\ntrial was underway to raise the point, he cannot now claim\na double jeopardy violation. U. S. Brief 22–25. The Gov-\nernment relies upon Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23\n(1977), in which the District Court dismissed an indict-\nment midtrial because it had failed to allege the required\nintent element of the offense. We held that retrial on a\ncorrected indictment was not barred, because the dismis-\nsal was akin to a mistrial, not an acquittal. This was clear\nbecause the District Court had separately denied the\ndefendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, explaining\nthat the defendant “ ‘has been proven [guilty] beyond any\nreasonable doubt in the world,’ ” while acknowledging that\nthe error in the indictment required dismissal. Id., at 26–\n27. Because the defendant “invited the court to interrupt\nthe proceedings before formalizing a finding on the merits”\nby raising the indictment issue so late, we held the princi-\nples governing a defendant’s consent to mistrial should\napply. Id., at 28 (citing Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600).\n   The Government suggests the situation here is “func-\ntionally similar,” because “identifying the elements of an\noffense is a necessary step in determining the sufficiency\nof a charging document.” U. S. Brief 23. But we can-\nnot ignore the fact that what the trial court actually did\nhere was rule on the sufficiency of the State’s proof, not\nthe sufficiency of the information filed against him. Lee\ndemonstrates that the two need not rise or fall together.\nAnd even if the Government is correct that Evans could\nhave challenged the charging document on the same legal\ntheory he used to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\nit matters that he made only the latter motion, a motion\nthat necessarily may not be made until trial is underway.\nEvans cannot be penalized for requesting from the court a\n14                      EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nruling on the merits of the State’s case, as the Michigan\nRules entitled him to do; whether he could have also\nbrought a distinct procedural objection earlier on is beside\nthe point.\n                             B\n  In the alternative, the State and the United States ask\nus to reconsider our past decisions. Brief for Respondent\n34–56 (suggesting overruling our cases since at least\nFong Foo); U. S. Brief 27–32 (suggesting overruling Smith,\nRumsey, and Smalis).8 We declined to revisit our cases\nwhen the United States made a similar request in Smalis.\n476 U. S., at 144; see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae in Smalis v. Pennsylvania, O. T. 1985, No. 85–227,\npp. 19–25. And we decline to do so here.\n  First, we have no reason to believe the existing rules\nhave become so “unworkable” as to justify overruling\nprecedent. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).\nThe distinction drawn in Scott has stood the test of time,\nand we expect courts will continue to have little “difficulty\nin distinguishing between those rulings which relate to\nthe ultimate question of guilt or innocence and those\nwhich serve other purposes.” 437 U. S., at 98, n. 11 (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). See, e.g., United States\nv. Dionisio, 503 F. 3d 78, 83–88 (CA2 2007) (collecting\ncases); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Crimi-\nnal Procedure §25.3(a), p. 629 (3d ed. 2007) (same).\n  Second, the logic of these cases still holds. There is no\n\n——————\n  8 The dissent’s true gripe may be with these cases as well, rather than\nour result here, which, we have explained, follows inevitably from\nthem. See post, at 5 (noting “how far [our cases] have departed from\nthe common-law principles that applied at the time of the founding”);\ncompare post, at 12 (“Permitting retrial in these egregious cases is\nespecially appropriate”), with Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141,\n143 (1962) (per curiam) (according finality to even those acquittals\n“based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion that a jury verdict of acquittal precludes retrial,\nand thus bars appeal of any legal error that may have led\nto that acquittal. See Ball, 163 U. S., at 671. So, had the\ntrial court here instructed the jury that it must find the\nburned structure was not a dwelling in order to convict,\nthe jury would have acquitted Evans accordingly; “ ‘[a] jury\nis presumed to follow its instructions.’ ” Blueford v. Ar-\nkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (quoting\nWeeks v. Angelone, 528 U. S. 225, 234 (2000)). And that\nwould have been the end of the matter. From that prem-\nise, Fong Foo’s holding follows: If a trial court instead\nexercises its discretion to direct a jury to return a verdict\nof acquittal, jeopardy also terminates notwithstanding any\nlegal error, because there too it is the jury that returns an\nacquittal. And from there, Martin Linen’s conclusion is\nunavoidable: It should make no difference whether the\ncourt employs the formality of directing the jury to return\nan acquittal or whether the court enters an acquittal\nitself. Sanabria, Rumsey, Smalis, and Smith merely apply\nFong Foo and Martin Linen in tandem: If a trial court\nmakes an antecedent legal error (as in Fong Foo), and\nthen grants a judgment of acquittal rather than directing\nthe jury to acquit (as in Martin Linen), the result is an\nacquittal all the same.\n   In other words, there is no way for antecedent legal\nerrors to be reviewable in the context of judicial acquittals\nunless those errors are also reviewable when they give rise\nto jury acquittals (contrary to the settled understanding\nthat a jury verdict of acquittal is unreviewable), or unless\nwe distinguish between juries that acquit pursuant to\ntheir instructions and judicial acquittals (notwithstand-\ning that this is a purely formal distinction). Neither op-\ntion has become more attractive with time. We therefore\nreiterate: “any contention that the Double Jeopardy\nClause must itself . . . leave open a way of correcting legal\nerrors is at odds with the well-established rule that the\n16                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nbar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently\nwrong in law.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 473.\n   Finally, the State and the United States object that this\nrule denies the prosecution a full and fair opportunity\nto present its evidence to the jury, while the defendant\nreaps a “windfall” from the trial court’s unreviewable error.\nBrief for Respondent 6; U. S. Brief 31–32. But sovereigns\nare hardly powerless to prevent this sort of situation, as\nwe observed in Smith, 543 U. S., at 474. Nothing obligates\na jurisdiction to afford its trial courts the power to grant a\nmidtrial acquittal, and at least two States disallow the\npractice. See Nev. Rev. Stat. §175.381(1) (2011); State v.\nParfait, 96, 1814 (La. App. 1 Cir. 05/09/97), 693 So. 2d\n1232, 1242. Many jurisdictions, including the federal\nsystem, allow or encourage their courts to defer considera-\ntion of a motion to acquit until after the jury returns a\nverdict, which mitigates double jeopardy concerns.9 See\nFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(b). And for cases such as this, in\nwhich a trial court’s interpretation of the relevant criminal\nstatute is likely to prove dispositive, we see no reason why\njurisdictions could not provide for mandatory continuances\nor expedited interlocutory appeals if they wished to pre-\nvent misguided acquittals from being entered.10 But\nhaving chosen to vest its courts with the power to grant\nmidtrial acquittals, the State must bear the corresponding\nrisk that some acquittals will be granted in error.\n\n——————\n  9 If a court grants a motion to acquit after the jury has convicted,\n\nthere is no double jeopardy barrier to an appeal by the government\nfrom the court’s acquittal, because reversal would result in reinstate-\nment of the jury verdict of guilt, not a new trial. United States v.\nWilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975).\n  10 Here, the prosecutor twice asked the court for a recess to review the\n\nMichigan statutes and to discuss the question with her supervisor. 491\nMich., at 7, 810 N. W. 2d, at 538–539. If the trial court’s refusal was ill-\nadvised, that is a matter for state procedure to address, but it does not\nbear on the double jeopardy consequences of the acquittal that followed.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMichigan is\n                                                  Reversed.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

MICHIGAN\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                      MICHIGAN\n\n                     [February 20, 2013]\n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.\n  The Court holds that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars\npetitioner’s retrial for arson because his attorney managed\nto convince a judge to terminate petitioner’s first trial\nprior to verdict on the specious ground that the offense\nwith which he was charged contains an imaginary “ele-\nment” that the prosecution could not prove. The Court’s\ndecision makes no sense. It is not consistent with the\noriginal meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause; it does\nnot serve the purposes of the prohibition against double\njeopardy; and contrary to the Court’s reasoning, the trial\njudge’s ruling was not an “acquittal,” which our cases have\n“consistently” defined as a decision that “ ‘actually repre-\nsents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the\nfactual elements of the offense charged.’ ” E.g., Smith v.\nMassachusetts, 543 U. S. 462, 468 (2005) (quoting United\nStates v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571\n(1977); emphasis added). For no good reason, the Court\ndeprives the State of Michigan of its right to have one fair\nopportunity to convict petitioner, and I therefore respect-\nfully dissent.\n                             I\n  After Detroit police officers heard an explosion at a\nburning house, they observed petitioner running away\nfrom the building with a gasoline can.

MICHIGAN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsued and ultimately apprehended petitioner, who admit-\nted that he had burned down the house. No one was living\nin the house at the time of the fire.\n    If the house in question had been a “dwelling house,”\npetitioner could have been charged under Mich. Comp.\nLaws §750.72 (1981) for burning a dwelling, an offense\npunishable by imprisonment for up to 20 years. But peti-\ntioner was instead charged with “[b]urning other real\nproperty” in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws §750.73. This\noffense, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’\nimprisonment, applies to “[a]ny person who wilfully or\nmaliciously burns any building or other real property . . .\nother than those specified in [§750.72].” This crime is a\nlesser included offense of the crime of burning a dwelling\nhouse. The “necessary elements to prove either offense\nare the same, except to prove the greater [offense] it must\nbe shown that the building is a dwelling.” 491 Mich. 1,\n19–20, 810 N. W. 2d 535, 545–546 (2012) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). To prove the lesser offense, however,\n“ ‘it is not necessary to prove that the building is not a\ndwelling.’ ” Id., at 20, 810 N. W. 2d, at 546 (emphasis\nadded).\n    At the close of the prosecution’s case, petitioner’s attor-\nney moved for a directed verdict on the ground that (1) the\nprosecution was required to prove, as an “element” of\nthe charged offense, that “the building was not a dwelling”\nand (2) “the prosecution had failed to prove that the\nburned building was not a dwelling house.” Id., at 5, 810\nN. W. 2d, at 537. The prosecutor responded by arguing\nthat nothing in the charged offense requires proof that the\nbuilding was not a dwelling, and the prosecutor requested\n“a moment” to “pull the statute” and “consult with [her]\nsupervisors.” Id., at 5–7, 810 N. W. 2d, at 537–539. The\ntrial judge denied the prosecutor’s requests and errone-\nously concluded that the prosecution was required to prove\nthat the burned building was not a dwelling.

W. 2d, at 536;\nsee also 288 Mich. App. 410, 416, and n. 2, 794 N. W. 2d\n848, 852, and n. 2 (2010). The Michigan Court of Appeals\nagreed with this concession and went on to hold that\nthe trial judge’s ruling did not constitute an “acquittal” for\ndouble jeopardy purposes because the ruling did not rep-\nresent “a resolution in the defendant’s favor . . . of a fac-\ntual element necessary for a criminal conviction.” Id., at\n421–422, 794 N. W. 2d, at 856 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed, holding\nthat when, as here, a trial judge erroneously adds an ex-\ntra “element” to a charged offense and subsequently de-\ntermines that the prosecution did not prove that extra\n“element,” the trial judge’s decision is not based on the de-\nfendant’s guilt or innocence of the elements of the charged\noffense. 491 Mich., at 3–4, 19–21, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536–\n537, 545–546. Accordingly, the Michigan Supreme Court\nconcluded that the judge’s ruling in this case “does not\nconstitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy\nand retrial is . . . not barred.” Id., at 4, 810 N. W. 2d, at\n537.\n                          II\n  This Court now reverses the decision             of the State Su-\npreme Court, but the Court’s holding               is supported by\nneither the original understanding of               the prohibition\nagainst double jeopardy nor any of the             reasons for that\nprohibition.\n4                         EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                             A\n  The prohibition against double jeopardy “had its origin\nin the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autre-\nfois convict, and pardon,” which “prevented the retrial of a\nperson who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or\npardoned for the same offense.” United States v. Scott,\n437 U. S. 82, 87 (1978); see Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28,\n33 (1978). As the Court has previously explained, “the\ncommon-law protection against double jeopardy historically\napplied only to charges on which a jury had rendered a\nverdict.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 466 (emphasis added).1 As a\nresult, the original understanding of the Clause, which is\n“hardly a matter of dispute,” Scott, supra, at 87, does not\ncompel the Court’s conclusion that a defendant is acquit-\nted for double jeopardy purposes whenever a judge issues\na preverdict ruling that the prosecution has failed to prove\na nonexistent “element” of the charged offense.\n  Although our decisions have expanded double jeopardy\nprotection beyond its common-law origins, see, e.g., Smith,\nsupra, at 466–467 (acknowledging the Court’s expansion\nof “the common-law protection against double jeopardy”);\n\n——————\n   1 See also Crist, 437 U.

S., at 96. And given how far we have depart-\ned from the common-law principles that applied at the\ntime of the founding, we should at least ensure that our\ndecisions in this area serve the underlying purposes of the\nconstitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. See\nid., at 95–96, 100–101. Yet today’s decision fails to ad-\nvance the purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n                              B\n   The Double Jeopardy Clause is largely based on “the\ndeeply ingrained principle that the State with all its re-\nsources and power should not be allowed to make repeated\nattempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense,\nthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and or-\ndeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of\nanxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibil-\nity that even though innocent he may be found guilty.”\nYeager v. United States, 557 U. S. 110, 117–118 (2009)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Blueford v.\nArkansas, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5); Martin\nLinen, 430 U. S., at 569. Allowing retrial in the circum-\nstances of the present case would not result in any such\nabuse. The prosecution would not be afforded a second\nopportunity to persuade the factfinder that its evidence\nsatisfies the actual elements of the offense. Instead, be-\ncause the trial judge’s ruling in the first trial was not\nbased on an actual element of the charged offense, retrial\nwould simply give the prosecution one fair opportunity to\nprove its case.\n   Allowing retrial in this case would not permit prosecu-\ntors “to make repeated attempts to convict an individual\nfor an alleged offense,” Yeager, supra, at 117.

Thus, contrary to the Court’s unex-\nplained suggestion, see ante, at 5–6, “[t]his case hardly\npresents the specter of ‘an all-powerful state relentlessly\npursuing a defendant who had either been found not\nguilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of\nguilt submitted to the first trier of fact.’ ” Sattazahn v.\nPennsylvania, 537 U.

On the contrary, this is a case in\nwhich defense counsel fooled the judge into committing an\nerror that provided his client with an undeserved benefit,\nthe termination of a trial that the defense obviously did\nnot want to run to completion. The Double Jeopardy\nClause does not require that the defense receive an even\ngreater benefit, the protection provided by an acquittal.\n   As this Court has repeatedly emphasized in double\njeopardy cases, a State has an interest in receiving “one\ncomplete opportunity to convict those who have violated\nits laws,” Sattazahn, supra, at 115 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Scott, supra, at 100, but today’s decision\ndeprives the State of Michigan of this valuable right.\n                             C\n   The Court’s decision also flies in the face of our estab-\nlished understanding of the meaning of an acquittal for\ndouble jeopardy purposes. The Double Jeopardy Clause\nprovides that no person shall “be subject for the same\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 5 (emphasis added).          Thus, “[d]ouble-\njeopardy analysis focuses on the individual ‘offence’\ncharged.” Smith, 543 U. S., at 469, n. 3. And to determine\nwhat constitutes “the individual ‘offence’ charged,” ibid.,\nthe Court homes in on the elements of the offense. See\nUnited States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993) (“In both\nthe multiple punishment and multiple prosecution con-\ntexts, this Court has concluded that where the two of-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot\nsurvive the ‘same-elements’ test, the double jeopardy bar\napplies”). Consistent with the constitutional text’s focus\non the “offence”—and thus the elements—with which a\ndefendant is charged, the Court’s “double-jeopardy cases\nhave consistently” defined an acquittal as a decision that\n“ ‘actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some\nor all of the factual elements of the offense charged.’ ”\nSmith, supra, at 468 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at\n571); see also Scott, supra, at 97 (“[A] defendant is acquit-\nted only when the ruling of the judge, whatever its label,\nactually represents a resolution in the defendant’s favor,\ncorrect or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the\noffense charged” (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)).\n    Today, the Court effectively abandons the well-\nestablished definition of an acquittal. Indeed, in the face\nof our repeated holdings that an acquittal for double jeop-\nardy purposes requires a “resolution, correct or not, of\nsome or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,”\nSmith, supra, at 468; Martin Linen, supra, at 571; see\nalso Scott, supra, at 97, the Court now declares that “the\ntouchstone [is] not whether any particular elements were\nresolved,” ante, at 10 (emphasis added). Instead, the\nCourt proclaims that the dispositive question is whether a\nmidtrial termination represented a “procedural dismissa[l]”\nor a “substantive rulin[g],” ante, at 5. This reformulation\nof double jeopardy law is not faithful to our prece-\ndents—or to the Double Jeopardy Clause itself. The key\nquestion is not whether a ruling is “procedural” or “sub-\nstantive” (whatever those terms mean in this context), but\nwhether a ruling relates to the defendant’s factual guilt or\ninnocence with respect to the “offence,” see U. S. Const.,\nAmdt. 5—and thus the elements—with which he is\ncharged. See Scott, supra, at 87, 97–99, and n. 11.\n    When a judge evaluates the evidence and determines\n8                       EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the prosecution has not proved facts that are legally\nsufficient to satisfy the actual elements of the charged\noffense, the ruling, however labeled, represents an acquit-\ntal because it is founded on the defendant’s factual inno-\ncence. See Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 572. But when a\njudge manufactures an additional “element” of an offense\nand then holds that there is insufficient evidence to prove\nthat extra “element,” the judge has not resolved the de-\nfendant’s “factual guilt or innocence” as to any of the\nactual elements of the offense.2 Thus, the ruling, no mat-\nter what the judge calls it, does not acquit the defendant of\nthe offense with which he is charged. No acquittal occurs\nwhen a criminal trial is terminated “on a basis unrelated\nto factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which [a\ndefendant] is accused.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 87, 94–95, 98–\n99. “[I]n a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately\nchoosing to seek termination of the proceedings against\nhim on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of\nthe offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cog-\nnizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Govern-\nment is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial\ncourt in favor of the defendant.” Id., at 98–99 (reasoning\nthat, in such a case, the defendant was “neither acquitted\nnor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook\nto persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt\nor innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try\nhim”).\n\n\n\n——————\n   2 Because culpability for an offense can be negated by proof of an\n\naffirmative defense, the Court has held that a ruling that the prosecu-\ntion did not submit sufficient evidence to rebut an affirmative defense\nconstitutes an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes. See Burks v.\nUnited States, 437 U. S. 1, 10–11 (1978); Scott, 437 U. S., at 97–98.\nThus, as used in this opinion, the “elements” of an offense include\nlegally recognized affirmative defenses that would negate culpability.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   Contrary to the Court’s opinion, its decision in this case\nis not supported by prior precedent. In all three of the\nprincipal cases on which the Court relies—Smalis v. Penn-\nsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986); Smith, 543 U. S. 462; and\nArizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203 (1984)—trial judges\nruled that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof the offenses in question. In none of these cases (and in\nnone of our other double jeopardy cases) did a trial judge\nterminate a prosecution before verdict based on an ele-\nment of the judge’s own creation.\n   The first two cases, Smalis and Smith, involved gar-\nden variety preverdict acquittals, i.e., rulings based on the\nground that the prosecution had failed to introduce suffi-\ncient evidence to prove one or more of the actual elements\nof an offense. (Using conventional modern terminology,\nRule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nexplicitly labels such rulings “acquittal[s].”)\n   In Smalis, the judge, at the close of the prosecution’s\ncase in chief, granted a demurrer with respect to certain\ncharges on the ground that the evidence regarding those\ncharges was “legally insufficient to support a conviction.”\n476 U. S., at 141. The State Supreme Court held that this\nruling was not an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes\nbecause it was based on a legal determination (i.e., that\nthe evidence was not sufficient) rather than a factual\nfinding, but we rejected that distinction. Id., at 143–144.\nSee also Sanabria v. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 71–72\n(1978).\n   Smith involved a similar situation. There, one of the\nelements of a firearms offense with which the defendant\nwas charged required proof that the gun “had a barrel ‘less\nthan 16 inches’ in length,” 543 U. S., at 464, and the trial\njudge dismissed this charge before verdict on the ground\nthat the prosecution had not introduced sufficient evi-\n10                   EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ndence to establish this undisputed element, id., at 464–\n465. Before the remaining charges were submitted to the\njury, however, the judge reversed this ruling and allowed\nthe charge to go to the jury. Id., at 465. We held, how-\never, that the judge’s prior ruling constituted an acquittal\nand therefore barred the defendant’s conviction for this\noffense. Id., at 467–469. Thus, both Smalis and Smith\ninvolved rulings that were very different from the one at\nissue here. In both of those earlier cases, the trial judges\nheld that the evidence was insufficient to prove undis-\nputed elements of the offenses in question. In neither case\ndid the judge invent a new element.\n   The final case, Rumsey, differs from Smalis and Smith\nin only one particular. Like Smalis and Smith, Rumsey\ninvolved a ruling that the prosecution’s evidence was in-\nsufficient to prove an element, but in Rumsey the ruling\nwas predicated on a misconstruction of an element. In\nthat case, after the defendant was found guilty of first-\ndegree murder, the “trial judge, with no jury, . . . con-\nducted a separate sentencing hearing” at which he deter-\nmined that no aggravating circumstances were present. 467\nU. S., at 205. In particular, the judge found that the\nprosecution had not proved that the murder had been\ncommitted “ ‘as consideration for the receipt, or in expecta-\ntion of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.’ ” Id., at\n205–206 (quoting Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–703(F)(5)\n(Supp. 1983–1984)). The judge reached this conclusion\nbecause, in his (incorrect) view, that aggravating circum-\nstance was limited to contract killings. 467 U. S., at 205–\n206. Holding that the judge’s ruling constituted an acquit-\ntal on the merits of the question whether a death sentence\nwas appropriate, we noted that the ruling rested on “a\nmisconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain\naggravating circumstance.” Id., at 211. Accordingly, the\nruling was based on a determination that there was insuf-\nficient evidence to prove a real element; it was not based\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\non the judicial invention of an extra “element.” And for\nthat reason, it does not support the nonsensical result that\nthe Court reaches today.\n   The Court may feel compelled to reach that result be-\ncause it thinks that it would be unworkable to draw a\ndistinction between a preverdict termination based on the\ntrial judge’s misconstruction of an element of an offense\nand a preverdict termination based on the judge’s percep-\ntion that a statute contains an “element” that is actually\nnonexistent. This practical concern is overblown. There\nmay be cases in which this determination presents prob-\nlems, but surely there are many cases in which the de-\ntermination is quite easy. The present case is a perfect\nexample, for here there is no real dispute that the trial\njudge’s ruling was based on a nonexistent statutory “ele-\nment.” As noted, defense counsel conceded on appeal that\nthe judge had “wrongly added an extraneous element to\nthe statute” under which his client was charged. 491\nMich., at 3, 810 N. W. 2d, at 536.\n   Another good example is provided by State v. Korsen,\n138 Idaho 706, 69 P. 3d 126 (2003), where a Magistrate\nerroneously concluded that the offense of criminal trespass\nunder Idaho law requires a showing that the defendant\ndid something to justify the property owner’s request for\nthe defendant to leave the premises. Id., at 710, 716–717,\n69 P. 3d, at 130, 136–137. There is no question that the\nMagistrate in Korsen “effectively created an additional\nstatutory element” before concluding that the prosecution\nhad presented insufficient evidence as to this purported\n“element.” See ibid. (holding that double jeopardy did not\nbar a retrial because the Magistrate’s “finding did not\nactually determine in [defendant’s] favor any of the essen-\ntial elements of the crime of trespass”).\n   Cases in which it can be said that a trial judge did not\nsimply misinterpret a real element of an offense but in-\nstead invented an entirely new and nonexistent “element”\n12                  EVANS v. MICHIGAN\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nare cases in which the judge’s error is particularly egre-\ngious.
