MINTON\n\n          CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n\n No. 11–1118. Argued January 16, 2013—Decided February 20, 2013\nPetitioner attorneys represented respondent Minton in a federal patent\n  infringement suit. The District Court declared Minton’s patent inva-\n  lid under the “on sale” bar since he had leased his interactive securi-\n  ties trading system to a securities brokerage “more than one year\n  prior to the date of the [patent] application.” 35 U. S. C. §102(b). In\n  a motion for reconsideration, Minton argued for the first time that\n  the lease was part of ongoing testing, and therefore fell within the\n  “experimental use” exception to the on-sale bar. The District Court\n  denied the motion and the Federal Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n  the District Court had appropriately held that argument waived.\n  Convinced that his attorneys’ failure to timely raise the argument\n  cost him the lawsuit and led to the invalidation of his patent, Minton\n  brought a legal malpractice action in Texas state court. His former\n  attorneys argued that Minton’s infringement claims would have\n  failed even if the experimental-use argument had been timely raised,\n  and the trial court agreed. On appeal, Minton claimed that the fed-\n  eral district courts had exclusive jurisdiction over claims like his un-\n  der 28 U. S. C. §1338(a), which provides for exclusive federal jurisdic-\n  tion over any case “arising under any Act of Congress relating to\n  patents.” Minton argued that the state trial court had therefore\n  lacked jurisdiction, and he should be able to start over with his mal-\n  practice suit in federal court. Applying the test of Grable & Sons\n  Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, the\n  Texas Court of Appeals rejected Minton’s argument, proceeded to the\n  merits, and determined that Minton had failed to establish experi-\n  mental use. The Texas Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the\n  case properly belonged in federal court because the success of Min-\n  ton’s malpractice claim relied upon a question of federal patent law.\nHeld: Section §1338(a) does not deprive the state courts of subject mat-\n2                            GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ter jurisdiction over Minton’s malpractice claim. Pp. 4–13.\n       (a) Congress has authorized the federal district courts to exercise\n    original jurisdiction over “any civil action arising under any Act of\n    Congress relating to patents,” and further decreed that “[n]o State\n    court shall have jurisdiction over any [such] claim.” §1338(a). Be-\n    cause federal law did not create the cause of action asserted by Min-\n    ton’s legal malpractice claim, the claim can “aris[e] under” federal pa-\n    tent law only if it “necessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually\n    disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain with-\n    out disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and\n    state judicial responsibilities.” Grable, 545 U. S., at 314. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Applying Grable’s inquiry here, it is clear that Minton’s legal\n    malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent law. Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Resolution of a federal patent question is “necessary” to Min-\n    ton’s case. To prevail on his claim, Minton must show that an exper-\n    imental-use argument would have prevailed if only petitioners had\n    timely made it in the earlier patent litigation. That hypothetical pa-\n    tent case within the malpractice case must be resolved to decide Min-\n    ton’s malpractice claim. P. 7.\n         (2) The federal issue is also “actually disputed.” Minton argues\n    that the experimental-use exception applied, which would have saved\n    his patent from the on-sale bar; petitioners argue that it did not.\n    Pp. 7–8.\n         (3) Minton’s argument founders, however, on Grable’s substanti-\n    ality requirement. The substantiality inquiry looks to the importance\n    of the issue to the federal system as a whole. Here, the federal issue\n    does not carry the necessary significance. No matter how the state\n    courts resolve the hypothetical “case within a case,” the real-world\n    result of the prior federal patent litigation will not change. Nor will\n    allowing state courts to resolve these cases undermine “the develop-\n    ment of a uniform body of [patent] law.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thun-\n    der Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 162. The federal courts have ex-\n    clusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases, and in resolving the\n    nonhypothetical patent questions those cases present they are of\n    course not bound by state precedents. Minton suggests that state\n    courts’ answers to hypothetical patent questions can sometimes have\n    real-world effect on other patents through issue preclusion, but even\n    assuming that is true, such “fact-bound and situation-specific” effects\n    are not sufficient to establish arising under jurisdiction, Empire\n    HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U. S. 677, 701. Finally,\n    the federal courts’ greater familiarity with patent law is not enough,\n    by itself, to trigger the federal courts’ exclusive patent jurisdiction.\n    Pp. 8–12.\n         (4) It follows from the foregoing that Minton does not meet Gra-\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

GUNN, ET AL., PETITIONERS v.\n\n               VERNON F. MINTON\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n                             [February 20, 2013]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases\n“arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.”\n28 U. S. C. §1338(a). The question presented is whether a\nstate law claim alleging legal malpractice in the handling\nof a patent case must be brought in federal court.\n                              I\n   In the early 1990s, respondent Vernon Minton devel-\noped a computer program and telecommunications net-\nwork designed to facilitate securities trading. In March\n1995, he leased the system—known as the Texas Comput-\ner Exchange Network, or TEXCEN—to R. M. Stark & Co.,\na securities brokerage. A little over a year later, he ap-\nplied for a patent for an interactive securities trading\nsystem that was based substantially on TEXCEN. The\nU. S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the patent in\nJanuary 2000.\n   Patent in hand, Minton filed a patent infringement suit\nin Federal District Court against the National Association\nof Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and the NASDAQ Stock\nMarket, Inc. He was represented by Jerry Gunn and the\n2                     GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother petitioners. NASD and NASDAQ moved for sum-\nmary judgment on the ground that Minton’s patent was\ninvalid under the “on sale” bar, 35 U. S. C. §102(b). That\nprovision specifies that an inventor is not entitled to a\npatent if “the invention was . . . on sale in [the United\nStates], more than one year prior to the date of the appli-\ncation,” and Minton had leased TEXCEN to Stark more\nthan one year prior to filing his patent application. Reject-\ning Minton’s argument that there were differences be-\ntween TEXCEN and the patented system that precluded\napplication of the on-sale bar, the District Court granted\nthe summary judgment motion and declared Minton’s\npatent invalid. Minton v. National Assn. of Securities\nDealers, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2322910\"><a href=\"/txed/cUwb/minton-v-national-assn-of-securities-dealers/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 873, 883–884 (ED Tex.\n2002).\n  Minton then filed a motion for reconsideration in the\nDistrict Court, arguing for the first time that the lease\nagreement with Stark was part of ongoing testing of\nTEXCEN and therefore fell within the “experimental use”\nexception to the on-sale bar. See generally Pfaff v. Wells\nElectronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 64 (1998) (describing the\nexception). The District Court denied the motion. Minton\nv. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., No. 9:00–cv–\n00019 (ED Tex., July 15, 2002).\n  Minton appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit. That court affirmed, concluding that the\nDistrict Court had appropriately held Minton’s experi-\nmental-use argument waived. See Minton v. National\nAssn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 336 F. 3d 1373, 1379–\n1380 (CA Fed. 2003).\n  Minton, convinced that his attorneys’ failure to raise the\nexperimental-use argument earlier had cost him the law-\nsuit and led to invalidation of his patent, brought this\nmalpractice action in Texas state court. His former law-\nyers defended on the ground that the lease to Stark was\nnot, in fact, for an experimental use, and that therefore\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMinton’s patent infringement claims would have failed\neven if the experimental-use argument had been timely\nraised. The trial court agreed, holding that Minton had\nput forward “less than a scintilla of proof ” that the lease\nhad been for an experimental purpose. App. 213. It ac-\ncordingly granted summary judgment to Gunn and the\nother lawyer defendants.\n  On appeal, Minton raised a new argument: Because his\nlegal malpractice claim was based on an alleged error in a\npatent case, it “aris[es] under” federal patent law for\npurposes of 28 U. S. C. §1338(a). And because, under\n§1338(a), “[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any\nclaim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating\nto patents,” the Texas court—where Minton had originally\nbrought his malpractice claim—lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to decide the case. Accordingly, Minton ar-\ngued, the trial court’s order should be vacated and the case\ndismissed, leaving Minton free to start over in the Federal\nDistrict Court.\n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals of Texas rejected\nMinton’s argument. Applying the test we articulated in\nGrable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering\n& Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314 (2005), it held that the federal\ninterests implicated by Minton’s state law claim were not\nsufficiently substantial to trigger §1338 “arising under”\njurisdiction. It also held that finding exclusive federal\njurisdiction over state legal malpractice actions would,\ncontrary to Grable’s commands, disturb the balance of\nfederal and state judicial responsibilities. Proceeding to\nthe merits of Minton’s malpractice claim, the Court of\nAppeals affirmed the trial court’s determination that\nMinton had failed to establish experimental use and that\narguments on that ground therefore would not have saved\nhis infringement suit.\n  The Supreme Court of Texas reversed, relying heavily\non a pair of cases from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\n4                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal Circuit. 355 S. W. 3d 634, 641–642 (2011) (dis-\ncussing Air Measurement Technologies, Inc. v. Akin Gump\nStrauss Hauer & Feld, L. L. P., 504 F. 3d 1262 (2007);\nImmunocept, LLC v. Fulbright & Jaworski, LLP, 504 F. 3d\n1281 (2007)). The Court concluded that Minton’s claim\ninvolved “a substantial federal issue” within the meaning\nof Grable “because the success of Minton’s malpractice\nclaim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use\nexception as a defense to the on-sale bar.” 355 S. W. 3d, at\n644. Adjudication of Minton’s claim in federal court was\nconsistent with the appropriate balance between federal\nand state judicial responsibilities, it held, because “the\nfederal government and patent litigants have an interest\nin the uniform application of patent law by courts well-\nversed in that subject matter.” Id., at 646 (citing Im-\nmunocept, supra, at 1285–1286; Air Measurement Tech-\nnologies, supra, at 1272).\n  Justice Guzman, joined by Justices Medina and Willett,\ndissented. The dissenting justices would have held that\nthe federal issue was neither substantial nor disputed,\nand that maintaining the proper balance of responsibility\nbetween state and federal courts precluded relegating\nstate legal malpractice claims to federal court.\n  We granted certiorari. 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n   “Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,” pos-\nsessing “only that power authorized by Constitution and\nstatute.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America,\n511 U. S. 375, 377 (1994). There is no dispute that the\nConstitution permits Congress to extend federal court\njurisdiction to a case such as this one, see Osborn v. Bank\nof United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85451\"><a href=\"/scotus/rpi/osborn-v-bank-of-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823–824 (1824); the ques-\ntion is whether Congress has done so, see Powell v.\nMcCormack, 395 U.

S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndistrict courts to exercise original jurisdiction in “all civil\nactions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of\nthe United States,” 28 U. S. C. §1331, and, more particu-\nlarly, over “any civil action arising under any Act of Con-\ngress relating to patents,” §1338(a). Adhering to the\ndemands of “[l]inguistic consistency,” we have interpreted\nthe phrase “arising under” in both sections identically,\napplying our §1331 and §1338(a) precedents interchange-\nably. See Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp.,\n486 U. S. 800, 808–809 (1988). For cases falling within\nthe patent-specific arising under jurisdiction of §1338(a),\nhowever, Congress has not only provided for federal juris-\ndiction but also eliminated state jurisdiction, decreeing\nthat “[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any\nclaim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating\nto patents.” §1338(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V). To determine\nwhether jurisdiction was proper in the Texas courts, there-\nfore, we must determine whether it would have been\nproper in a federal district court—whether, that is, the\ncase “aris[es] under any Act of Congress relating to pa-\ntents.”\n   For statutory purposes, a case can “aris[e] under” feder-\nal law in two ways. Most directly, a case arises under\nfederal law when federal law creates the cause of action\nasserted. See American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler\nCo., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916) (“A suit arises under the law\nthat creates the cause of action”). As a rule of inclusion,\nthis “creation” test admits of only extremely rare excep-\ntions, see, e.g., Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S.\n505 (1900), and accounts for the vast bulk of suits that\narise under federal law, see Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.\nConstruction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n463 U. S. 1, 9 (1983). Minton’s original patent infringe-\nment suit against NASD and NASDAQ, for example, arose\nunder federal law in this manner because it was author-\nized by 35 U. S. C. §§271, 281.\n6                      GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   But even where a claim finds its origins in state rather\nthan federal law—as Minton’s legal malpractice claim\nindisputably does—we have identified a “special and small\ncategory” of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still\nlies. Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547\nU. S. 677, 699 (2006). In outlining the contours of this\nslim category, we do not paint on a blank canvas. Unfor-\ntunately, the canvas looks like one that Jackson Pollock\ngot to first. See 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & R.\nFreer, Federal Practice and Procedure §3562, pp. 175–176\n(3d ed. 2008) (reviewing general confusion on question).\n   In an effort to bring some order to this unruly doctrine\nseveral Terms ago, we condensed our prior cases into the\nfollowing inquiry: Does the “state-law claim necessarily\nraise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and sub-\nstantial, which a federal forum may entertain without\ndisturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal\nand state judicial responsibilities”? Grable, 545 U. S., at\n314. That is, federal jurisdiction over a state law claim\nwill lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actu-\nally disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution\nin federal court without disrupting the federal-state bal-\nance approved by Congress. Where all four of these re-\nquirements are met, we held, jurisdiction is proper be-\ncause there is a “serious federal interest in claiming the\nadvantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,”\nwhich can be vindicated without disrupting Congress’s\nintended division of labor between state and federal\ncourts. Id., at 313–314.\n                             III\n  Applying Grable’s inquiry here, it is clear that Minton’s\nlegal malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent\nlaw. Indeed, for the reasons we discuss, we are comforta-\nble concluding that state legal malpractice claims based on\nunderlying patent matters will rarely, if ever, arise under\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal patent law for purposes of §1338(a). Although\nsuch cases may necessarily raise disputed questions of\npatent law, those cases are by their nature unlikely to\nhave the sort of significance for the federal system neces-\nsary to establish jurisdiction.\n                               A\n   To begin, we acknowledge that resolution of a federal\npatent question is “necessary” to Minton’s case. Under\nTexas law, a plaintiff alleging legal malpractice must\nestablish four elements: (1) that the defendant attorney\nowed the plaintiff a duty; (2) that the attorney breached\nthat duty; (3) that the breach was the proximate cause of\nthe plaintiff ’s injury; and (4) that damages occurred. See\nAlexander v. Turtur & Associates, Inc., 146 S. W. 3d 113,\n117 (Tex. 2004). In cases like this one, in which the attor-\nney’s alleged error came in failing to make a particular\nargument, the causation element requires a “case within a\ncase” analysis of whether, had the argument been made,\nthe outcome of the earlier litigation would have been\ndifferent. 355 S. W. 3d, at 639; see 4 R. Mallen & J.\nSmith, Legal Malpractice §37:15, pp. 1509–1520 (2012).\nTo prevail on his legal malpractice claim, therefore, Min-\nton must show that he would have prevailed in his federal\npatent infringement case if only petitioners had timely\nmade an experimental-use argument on his behalf. 355\nS. W. 3d, at 644. That will necessarily require application\nof patent law to the facts of Minton’s case.\n                             B\n  The federal issue is also “actually disputed” here—\nindeed, on the merits, it is the central point of dispute.\nMinton argues that the experimental-use exception\nproperly applied to his lease to Stark, saving his patent\nfrom the on-sale bar; petitioners argue that it did not.\nThis is just the sort of “ ‘dispute . . . respecting the . . .\n8                     GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffect of [federal] law’ ” that Grable envisioned. 545 U. S.,\nat 313 (quoting Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569\n(1912)).\n                              C\n  Minton’s argument founders on Grable’s next require-\nment, however, for the federal issue in this case is not\nsubstantial in the relevant sense. In reaching the opposite\nconclusion, the Supreme Court of Texas focused on the\nimportance of the issue to the plaintiff ’s case and to the\nparties before it. 355 S. W. 3d, at 644 (“because the suc-\ncess of Minton’s malpractice claim is reliant upon the\nviability of the experimental use exception as a defense to\nthe on-sale bar, we hold that it is a substantial federal\nissue”); see also Air Measurement Technologies, 504 F. 3d,\nat 1272 (“the issue is substantial, for it is a necessary\nelement of the malpractice case”). As our past cases show,\nhowever, it is not enough that the federal issue be signifi-\ncant to the particular parties in the immediate suit; that\nwill always be true when the state claim “necessarily\nraise[s]” a disputed federal issue, as Grable separately\nrequires. The substantiality inquiry under Grable looks\ninstead to the importance of the issue to the federal sys-\ntem as a whole.\n  In Grable itself, for example, the Internal Revenue\nService had seized property from the plaintiff and sold it\nto satisfy the plaintiff ’s federal tax delinquency. 545\nU. S., at 310–311. Five years later, the plaintiff filed a\nstate law quiet title action against the third party that\nhad purchased the property, alleging that the IRS had\nfailed to comply with certain federally imposed notice\nrequirements, so that the seizure and sale were invalid.\nIbid. In holding that the case arose under federal law, we\nprimarily focused not on the interests of the litigants\nthemselves, but rather on the broader significance of the\nnotice question for the Federal Government.

Kansas City Title & Trust\nCo., 255 U. S. 180 (1921), which Grable described as “[t]he\nclassic example” of a state claim arising under federal law.\n545 U. S., at 312. In Smith, the plaintiff argued that the\ndefendant bank could not purchase certain bonds issued\nby the Federal Government because the Government had\nacted unconstitutionally in issuing them. 255 U. S., at\n198. We held that the case arose under federal law, be-\ncause the “decision depends upon the determination” of\n“the constitutional validity of an act of Congress which is\ndirectly drawn in question.” Id., at 201. Again, the rele-\nvant point was not the importance of the question to the\nparties alone but rather the importance more generally of\na determination that the Government “securities were\nissued under an unconstitutional law, and hence of no\nvalidity.” Ibid.; see also Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nv. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 814, n. 12 (1986).\n   Here, the federal issue carries no such significance.\nBecause of the backward-looking nature of a legal mal-\npractice claim, the question is posed in a merely hypothet-\nical sense: If Minton’s lawyers had raised a timely experi-\nmental-use argument, would the result in the patent\ninfringement proceeding have been different? No matter\nhow the state courts resolve that hypothetical “case within\na case,” it will not change the real-world result of the prior\nfederal patent litigation. Minton’s patent will remain\n10                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninvalid.\n   Nor will allowing state courts to resolve these cases\nundermine “the development of a uniform body of [patent]\nlaw.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489\nU. S. 141, 162 (1989). Congress ensured such uniformity\nby vesting exclusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases\nin the federal district courts and exclusive appellate juris-\ndiction in the Federal Circuit. See 28 U. S. C. §§1338(a),\n1295(a)(1). In resolving the nonhypothetical patent ques-\ntions those cases present, the federal courts are of course\nnot bound by state court case-within-a-case patent rulings.\nSee Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 465 (1990). In any\nevent, the state court case-within-a-case inquiry asks\nwhat would have happened in the prior federal proceeding\nif a particular argument had been made. In answering\nthat question, state courts can be expected to hew closely\nto the pertinent federal precedents. It is those precedents,\nafter all, that would have applied had the argument been\nmade. Cf. ibid. (“State courts adjudicating civil RICO\nclaims will . . . be guided by federal court interpretations\nof the relevant federal criminal statutes, just as federal\ncourts sitting in diversity are guided by state court inter-\npretations of state law”).\n   As for more novel questions of patent law that may arise\nfor the first time in a state court “case within a case,” they\nwill at some point be decided by a federal court in the\ncontext of an actual patent case, with review in the Feder-\nal Circuit. If the question arises frequently, it will soon be\nresolved within the federal system, laying to rest any\ncontrary state court precedent; if it does not arise fre-\nquently, it is unlikely to implicate substantial federal\ninterests. The present case is “poles apart from Grable,”\nin which a state court’s resolution of the federal question\n“would be controlling in numerous other cases.” Empire\nHealthChoice Assurance, Inc., 547 U. S., at 700.\n   Minton also suggests that state courts’ answers to hypo-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthetical patent questions can sometimes have real-world\neffect on other patents through issue preclusion. Brief for\nRespondent 33–36. Minton, for example, has filed what is\nknown as a “continuation patent” application related to\nhis original patent. See 35 U. S. C. §120; 4A D. Chisum,\nPatents §13.03 (2005) (describing continuation applica-\ntions). He argues that, in evaluating this separate appli-\ncation, the patent examiner could be bound by the Texas\ntrial court’s interpretation of the scope of Minton’s original\npatent. See Brief for Respondent 35–36. It is unclear\nwhether this is true. The Patent and Trademark Office’s\nManual of Patent Examining Procedure provides that res\njudicata is a proper ground for rejecting a patent “only\nwhen the earlier decision was a decision of the Board of\nAppeals” or certain federal reviewing courts, giving no\nindication that state court decisions would have preclusive\neffect. See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark\nOffice, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n§706.03(w), p. 700–79 (rev. 8th ed. 2012); 35 U. S. C.\n§§134(a), 141, 145; Reply Brief 9–10. In fact, Minton has\nnot identified any case finding such preclusive effect based\non a state court decision. But even assuming that a state\ncourt’s case-within-a-case adjudication may be preclusive\nunder some circumstances, the result would be limited to\nthe parties and patents that had been before the state\ncourt. Such “fact-bound and situation-specific” effects are\nnot sufficient to establish federal arising under jurisdic-\ntion. Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc., supra, at 701.\n   Nor can we accept the suggestion that the federal courts’\ngreater familiarity with patent law means that legal\nmalpractice cases like this one belong in federal court. See\nAir Measurement Technologies, 504 F. 3d, at 1272 (“The\nlitigants will also benefit from federal judges who have\nexperience in claim construction and infringement mat-\nters”); 355 S. W. 3d, at 646 (“patent litigants have an\ninterest in the uniform application of patent law by courts\n12                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwell-versed in that subject matter”). It is true that a\nsimilar interest was among those we considered in Grable.\n545 U. S., at 314. But the possibility that a state court\nwill incorrectly resolve a state claim is not, by itself,\nenough to trigger the federal courts’ exclusive patent\njurisdiction, even if the potential error finds its root in a\nmisunderstanding of patent law.\n  There is no doubt that resolution of a patent issue in the\ncontext of a state legal malpractice action can be vitally\nimportant to the particular parties in that case. But\nsomething more, demonstrating that the question is signif-\nicant to the federal system as a whole, is needed. That is\nmissing here.\n                             D\n   It follows from the foregoing that Grable’s fourth re-\nquirement is also not met. That requirement is concerned\nwith the appropriate “balance of federal and state judicial\nresponsibilities.” Ibid. We have already explained the\nabsence of a substantial federal issue within the meaning\nof Grable. The States, on the other hand, have “a special\nresponsibility for maintaining standards among members\nof the licensed professions.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar\nAssn., 436 U. S. 447, 460 (1978). Their “interest . . . in\nregulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are\nessential to the primary governmental function of admin-\nistering justice, and have historically been officers of the\ncourts.” Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792\n(1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have no\nreason to suppose that Congress—in establishing exclu-\nsive federal jurisdiction over patent cases—meant to bar\nfrom state courts state legal malpractice claims simply\nbecause they require resolution of a hypothetical patent\nissue.\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Marshall Engine Co., 223 U. S. 473, 478\n(1912). In this case, although the state courts must an-\nswer a question of patent law to resolve Minton’s legal\nmalpractice claim, their answer will have no broader\neffects. It will not stand as binding precedent for any\nfuture patent claim; it will not even affect the validity of\nMinton’s patent.

Argued January 16, 2013—Decided February 20, 2013\nPetitioner attorneys represented respondent Minton in a federal patent\n  infringement suit. The District Court declared Minton’s patent inva-\n  lid under the “on sale” bar since he had leased his interactive securi-\n  ties trading system to a securities brokerage “more than one year\n  prior to the date of the [patent] application.” 35 U. S. C. §102(b). In\n  a motion for reconsideration, Minton argued for the first time that\n  the lease was part of ongoing testing, and therefore fell within the\n  “experimental use” exception to the on-sale bar. The District Court\n  denied the motion and the Federal Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n  the District Court had appropriately held that argument waived.\n  Convinced that his attorneys’ failure to timely raise the argument\n  cost him the lawsuit and led to the invalidation of his patent, Minton\n  brought a legal malpractice action in Texas state court. His former\n  attorneys argued that Minton’s infringement claims would have\n  failed even if the experimental-use argument had been timely raised,\n  and the trial court agreed. On appeal, Minton claimed that the fed-\n  eral district courts had exclusive jurisdiction over claims like his un-\n  der 28 U. S. C. §1338(a), which provides for exclusive federal jurisdic-\n  tion over any case “arising under any Act of Congress relating to\n  patents.” Minton argued that the state trial court had therefore\n  lacked jurisdiction, and he should be able to start over with his mal-\n  practice suit in federal court. Applying the test of Grable & Sons\n  Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, the\n  Texas Court of Appeals rejected Minton’s argument, proceeded to the\n  merits, and determined that Minton had failed to establish experi-\n  mental use. The Texas Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the\n  case properly belonged in federal court because the success of Min-\n  ton’s malpractice claim relied upon a question of federal patent law.\nHeld: Section §1338(a) does not deprive the state courts of subject mat-\n2                            GUNN v.

Pp. 4–13.\n       (a) Congress has authorized the federal district courts to exercise\n    original jurisdiction over “any civil action arising under any Act of\n    Congress relating to patents,” and further decreed that “[n]o State\n    court shall have jurisdiction over any [such] claim.” §1338(a). Be-\n    cause federal law did not create the cause of action asserted by Min-\n    ton’s legal malpractice claim, the claim can “aris[e] under” federal pa-\n    tent law only if it “necessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually\n    disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain with-\n    out disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and\n    state judicial responsibilities.” Grable, 545 U. S., at 314. Pp. 4–6.\n       (b) Applying Grable’s inquiry here, it is clear that Minton’s legal\n    malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent law. Pp. 6–12.\n         (1) Resolution of a federal patent question is “necessary” to Min-\n    ton’s case. To prevail on his claim, Minton must show that an exper-\n    imental-use argument would have prevailed if only petitioners had\n    timely made it in the earlier patent litigation. That hypothetical pa-\n    tent case within the malpractice case must be resolved to decide Min-\n    ton’s malpractice claim. P. 7.\n         (2) The federal issue is also “actually disputed.” Minton argues\n    that the experimental-use exception applied, which would have saved\n    his patent from the on-sale bar; petitioners argue that it did not.\n    Pp. 7–8.\n         (3) Minton’s argument founders, however, on Grable’s substanti-\n    ality requirement. The substantiality inquiry looks to the importance\n    of the issue to the federal system as a whole. Here, the federal issue\n    does not carry the necessary significance. No matter how the state\n    courts resolve the hypothetical “case within a case,” the real-world\n    result of the prior federal patent litigation will not change. Nor will\n    allowing state courts to resolve these cases undermine “the develop-\n    ment of a uniform body of [patent] law.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thun-\n    der Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 162. The federal courts have ex-\n    clusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases, and in resolving the\n    nonhypothetical patent questions those cases present they are of\n    course not bound by state precedents. Minton suggests that state\n    courts’ answers to hypothetical patent questions can sometimes have\n    real-world effect on other patents through issue preclusion, but even\n    assuming that is true, such “fact-bound and situation-specific” effects\n    are not sufficient to establish arising under jurisdiction, Empire\n    HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v.

MINTON\n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n                             [February 20, 2013]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n   Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases\n“arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.”\n28 U. S. C. §1338(a). The question presented is whether a\nstate law claim alleging legal malpractice in the handling\nof a patent case must be brought in federal court.\n                              I\n   In the early 1990s, respondent Vernon Minton devel-\noped a computer program and telecommunications net-\nwork designed to facilitate securities trading. In March\n1995, he leased the system—known as the Texas Comput-\ner Exchange Network, or TEXCEN—to R. M. Stark & Co.,\na securities brokerage. A little over a year later, he ap-\nplied for a patent for an interactive securities trading\nsystem that was based substantially on TEXCEN. The\nU. S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the patent in\nJanuary 2000.\n   Patent in hand, Minton filed a patent infringement suit\nin Federal District Court against the National Association\nof Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and the NASDAQ Stock\nMarket, Inc. He was represented by Jerry Gunn and the\n2                     GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nother petitioners. NASD and NASDAQ moved for sum-\nmary judgment on the ground that Minton’s patent was\ninvalid under the “on sale” bar, 35 U. S. C. §102(b). That\nprovision specifies that an inventor is not entitled to a\npatent if “the invention was . . . on sale in [the United\nStates], more than one year prior to the date of the appli-\ncation,” and Minton had leased TEXCEN to Stark more\nthan one year prior to filing his patent application. Reject-\ning Minton’s argument that there were differences be-\ntween TEXCEN and the patented system that precluded\napplication of the on-sale bar, the District Court granted\nthe summary judgment motion and declared Minton’s\npatent invalid. Minton v. National Assn. of Securities\nDealers, Inc., 226 F. Supp. 2d 845, 873, 883–884 (ED Tex.\n2002).\n  Minton then filed a motion for reconsideration in the\nDistrict Court, arguing for the first time that the lease\nagreement with Stark was part of ongoing testing of\nTEXCEN and therefore fell within the “experimental use”\nexception to the on-sale bar. See generally Pfaff v. Wells\nElectronics, Inc., 525 U. S. 55, 64 (1998) (describing the\nexception). The District Court denied the motion. Minton\nv. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., No. 9:00–cv–\n00019 (ED Tex., July 15, 2002).\n  Minton appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit. That court affirmed, concluding that the\nDistrict Court had appropriately held Minton’s experi-\nmental-use argument waived. See Minton v. National\nAssn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 336 F. 3d 1373, 1379–\n1380 (CA Fed. 2003).\n  Minton, convinced that his attorneys’ failure to raise the\nexperimental-use argument earlier had cost him the law-\nsuit and led to invalidation of his patent, brought this\nmalpractice action in Texas state court. His former law-\nyers defended on the ground that the lease to Stark was\nnot, in fact, for an experimental use, and that therefore\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMinton’s patent infringement claims would have failed\neven if the experimental-use argument had been timely\nraised. The trial court agreed, holding that Minton had\nput forward “less than a scintilla of proof ” that the lease\nhad been for an experimental purpose. App. 213. It ac-\ncordingly granted summary judgment to Gunn and the\nother lawyer defendants.\n  On appeal, Minton raised a new argument: Because his\nlegal malpractice claim was based on an alleged error in a\npatent case, it “aris[es] under” federal patent law for\npurposes of 28 U. S. C. §1338(a). And because, under\n§1338(a), “[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any\nclaim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating\nto patents,” the Texas court—where Minton had originally\nbrought his malpractice claim—lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to decide the case. Accordingly, Minton ar-\ngued, the trial court’s order should be vacated and the case\ndismissed, leaving Minton free to start over in the Federal\nDistrict Court.\n  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals of Texas rejected\nMinton’s argument. Applying the test we articulated in\nGrable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering\n& Mfg., 545 U. S. 308, 314 (2005), it held that the federal\ninterests implicated by Minton’s state law claim were not\nsufficiently substantial to trigger §1338 “arising under”\njurisdiction. It also held that finding exclusive federal\njurisdiction over state legal malpractice actions would,\ncontrary to Grable’s commands, disturb the balance of\nfederal and state judicial responsibilities. Proceeding to\nthe merits of Minton’s malpractice claim, the Court of\nAppeals affirmed the trial court’s determination that\nMinton had failed to establish experimental use and that\narguments on that ground therefore would not have saved\nhis infringement suit.\n  The Supreme Court of Texas reversed, relying heavily\non a pair of cases from the U. S. Court of Appeals for the\n4                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nFederal Circuit. 355 S.

Fulbright & Jaworski, LLP, 504 F. 3d\n1281 (2007)). The Court concluded that Minton’s claim\ninvolved “a substantial federal issue” within the meaning\nof Grable “because the success of Minton’s malpractice\nclaim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use\nexception as a defense to the on-sale bar.” 355 S. W. 3d, at\n644. Adjudication of Minton’s claim in federal court was\nconsistent with the appropriate balance between federal\nand state judicial responsibilities, it held, because “the\nfederal government and patent litigants have an interest\nin the uniform application of patent law by courts well-\nversed in that subject matter.” Id., at 646 (citing Im-\nmunocept, supra, at 1285–1286; Air Measurement Tech-\nnologies, supra, at 1272).\n  Justice Guzman, joined by Justices Medina and Willett,\ndissented. The dissenting justices would have held that\nthe federal issue was neither substantial nor disputed,\nand that maintaining the proper balance of responsibility\nbetween state and federal courts precluded relegating\nstate legal malpractice claims to federal court.\n  We granted certiorari. 568 U.

For cases falling within\nthe patent-specific arising under jurisdiction of §1338(a),\nhowever, Congress has not only provided for federal juris-\ndiction but also eliminated state jurisdiction, decreeing\nthat “[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any\nclaim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating\nto patents.” §1338(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V). To determine\nwhether jurisdiction was proper in the Texas courts, there-\nfore, we must determine whether it would have been\nproper in a federal district court—whether, that is, the\ncase “aris[es] under any Act of Congress relating to pa-\ntents.”\n   For statutory purposes, a case can “aris[e] under” feder-\nal law in two ways. Most directly, a case arises under\nfederal law when federal law creates the cause of action\nasserted. See American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler\nCo., 241 U. S. 257, 260 (1916) (“A suit arises under the law\nthat creates the cause of action”). As a rule of inclusion,\nthis “creation” test admits of only extremely rare excep-\ntions, see, e.g., Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S.\n505 (1900), and accounts for the vast bulk of suits that\narise under federal law, see Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v.\nConstruction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n463 U. S. 1, 9 (1983). Minton’s original patent infringe-\nment suit against NASD and NASDAQ, for example, arose\nunder federal law in this manner because it was author-\nized by 35 U. S. C. §§271, 281.\n6                      GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n   But even where a claim finds its origins in state rather\nthan federal law—as Minton’s legal malpractice claim\nindisputably does—we have identified a “special and small\ncategory” of cases in which arising under jurisdiction still\nlies. Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547\nU. S. 677, 699 (2006). In outlining the contours of this\nslim category, we do not paint on a blank canvas. Unfor-\ntunately, the canvas looks like one that Jackson Pollock\ngot to first. See 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & R.\nFreer, Federal Practice and Procedure §3562, pp. 175–176\n(3d ed. 2008) (reviewing general confusion on question).\n   In an effort to bring some order to this unruly doctrine\nseveral Terms ago, we condensed our prior cases into the\nfollowing inquiry: Does the “state-law claim necessarily\nraise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and sub-\nstantial, which a federal forum may entertain without\ndisturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal\nand state judicial responsibilities”? Grable, 545 U. S., at\n314. That is, federal jurisdiction over a state law claim\nwill lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actu-\nally disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution\nin federal court without disrupting the federal-state bal-\nance approved by Congress. Where all four of these re-\nquirements are met, we held, jurisdiction is proper be-\ncause there is a “serious federal interest in claiming the\nadvantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,”\nwhich can be vindicated without disrupting Congress’s\nintended division of labor between state and federal\ncourts. Id., at 313–314.\n                             III\n  Applying Grable’s inquiry here, it is clear that Minton’s\nlegal malpractice claim does not arise under federal patent\nlaw. Indeed, for the reasons we discuss, we are comforta-\nble concluding that state legal malpractice claims based on\nunderlying patent matters will rarely, if ever, arise under\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfederal patent law for purposes of §1338(a). Although\nsuch cases may necessarily raise disputed questions of\npatent law, those cases are by their nature unlikely to\nhave the sort of significance for the federal system neces-\nsary to establish jurisdiction.\n                               A\n   To begin, we acknowledge that resolution of a federal\npatent question is “necessary” to Minton’s case. Under\nTexas law, a plaintiff alleging legal malpractice must\nestablish four elements: (1) that the defendant attorney\nowed the plaintiff a duty; (2) that the attorney breached\nthat duty; (3) that the breach was the proximate cause of\nthe plaintiff ’s injury; and (4) that damages occurred. See\nAlexander v. Turtur & Associates, Inc., 146 S. W. 3d 113,\n117 (Tex. 2004). In cases like this one, in which the attor-\nney’s alleged error came in failing to make a particular\nargument, the causation element requires a “case within a\ncase” analysis of whether, had the argument been made,\nthe outcome of the earlier litigation would have been\ndifferent. 355 S. W. 3d, at 639; see 4 R. Mallen & J.\nSmith, Legal Malpractice §37:15, pp. 1509–1520 (2012).\nTo prevail on his legal malpractice claim, therefore, Min-\nton must show that he would have prevailed in his federal\npatent infringement case if only petitioners had timely\nmade an experimental-use argument on his behalf. 355\nS. W. 3d, at 644. That will necessarily require application\nof patent law to the facts of Minton’s case.\n                             B\n  The federal issue is also “actually disputed” here—\nindeed, on the merits, it is the central point of dispute.\nMinton argues that the experimental-use exception\nproperly applied to his lease to Stark, saving his patent\nfrom the on-sale bar; petitioners argue that it did not.\nThis is just the sort of “ ‘dispute . . . respecting the . . .\n8                     GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\neffect of [federal] law’ ” that Grable envisioned. 545 U. S.,\nat 313 (quoting Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569\n(1912)).\n                              C\n  Minton’s argument founders on Grable’s next require-\nment, however, for the federal issue in this case is not\nsubstantial in the relevant sense. In reaching the opposite\nconclusion, the Supreme Court of Texas focused on the\nimportance of the issue to the plaintiff ’s case and to the\nparties before it. 355 S. W. 3d, at 644 (“because the suc-\ncess of Minton’s malpractice claim is reliant upon the\nviability of the experimental use exception as a defense to\nthe on-sale bar, we hold that it is a substantial federal\nissue”); see also Air Measurement Technologies, 504 F. 3d,\nat 1272 (“the issue is substantial, for it is a necessary\nelement of the malpractice case”). As our past cases show,\nhowever, it is not enough that the federal issue be signifi-\ncant to the particular parties in the immediate suit; that\nwill always be true when the state claim “necessarily\nraise[s]” a disputed federal issue, as Grable separately\nrequires. The substantiality inquiry under Grable looks\ninstead to the importance of the issue to the federal sys-\ntem as a whole.\n  In Grable itself, for example, the Internal Revenue\nService had seized property from the plaintiff and sold it\nto satisfy the plaintiff ’s federal tax delinquency. 545\nU. S., at 310–311. Five years later, the plaintiff filed a\nstate law quiet title action against the third party that\nhad purchased the property, alleging that the IRS had\nfailed to comply with certain federally imposed notice\nrequirements, so that the seizure and sale were invalid.\nIbid. In holding that the case arose under federal law, we\nprimarily focused not on the interests of the litigants\nthemselves, but rather on the broader significance of the\nnotice question for the Federal Government. We empha-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsized the Government’s “strong interest” in being able to\nrecover delinquent taxes through seizure and sale of prop-\nerty, which in turn “require[d] clear terms of notice to\nallow buyers . . . to satisfy themselves that the Service has\ntouched the bases necessary for good title.” Id., at 315.\nThe Government’s “direct interest in the availability of a\nfederal forum to vindicate its own administrative action”\nmade the question “an important issue of federal law that\nsensibly belong[ed] in a federal court.” Ibid.\n   A second illustration of the sort of substantiality we\nrequire comes from Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust\nCo., 255 U. S. 180 (1921), which Grable described as “[t]he\nclassic example” of a state claim arising under federal law.\n545 U. S., at 312. In Smith, the plaintiff argued that the\ndefendant bank could not purchase certain bonds issued\nby the Federal Government because the Government had\nacted unconstitutionally in issuing them. 255 U. S., at\n198. We held that the case arose under federal law, be-\ncause the “decision depends upon the determination” of\n“the constitutional validity of an act of Congress which is\ndirectly drawn in question.” Id., at 201. Again, the rele-\nvant point was not the importance of the question to the\nparties alone but rather the importance more generally of\na determination that the Government “securities were\nissued under an unconstitutional law, and hence of no\nvalidity.” Ibid.; see also Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nv. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, 814, n. 12 (1986).\n   Here, the federal issue carries no such significance.\nBecause of the backward-looking nature of a legal mal-\npractice claim, the question is posed in a merely hypothet-\nical sense: If Minton’s lawyers had raised a timely experi-\nmental-use argument, would the result in the patent\ninfringement proceeding have been different? No matter\nhow the state courts resolve that hypothetical “case within\na case,” it will not change the real-world result of the prior\nfederal patent litigation. Minton’s patent will remain\n10                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ninvalid.\n   Nor will allowing state courts to resolve these cases\nundermine “the development of a uniform body of [patent]\nlaw.” Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489\nU. S. 141, 162 (1989). Congress ensured such uniformity\nby vesting exclusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases\nin the federal district courts and exclusive appellate juris-\ndiction in the Federal Circuit. See 28 U. S. C. §§1338(a),\n1295(a)(1). In resolving the nonhypothetical patent ques-\ntions those cases present, the federal courts are of course\nnot bound by state court case-within-a-case patent rulings.\nSee Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 465 (1990). In any\nevent, the state court case-within-a-case inquiry asks\nwhat would have happened in the prior federal proceeding\nif a particular argument had been made. In answering\nthat question, state courts can be expected to hew closely\nto the pertinent federal precedents. It is those precedents,\nafter all, that would have applied had the argument been\nmade. Cf. ibid. (“State courts adjudicating civil RICO\nclaims will . . . be guided by federal court interpretations\nof the relevant federal criminal statutes, just as federal\ncourts sitting in diversity are guided by state court inter-\npretations of state law”).\n   As for more novel questions of patent law that may arise\nfor the first time in a state court “case within a case,” they\nwill at some point be decided by a federal court in the\ncontext of an actual patent case, with review in the Feder-\nal Circuit. If the question arises frequently, it will soon be\nresolved within the federal system, laying to rest any\ncontrary state court precedent; if it does not arise fre-\nquently, it is unlikely to implicate substantial federal\ninterests. The present case is “poles apart from Grable,”\nin which a state court’s resolution of the federal question\n“would be controlling in numerous other cases.” Empire\nHealthChoice Assurance, Inc., 547 U. S., at 700.\n   Minton also suggests that state courts’ answers to hypo-\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthetical patent questions can sometimes have real-world\neffect on other patents through issue preclusion. Brief for\nRespondent 33–36. Minton, for example, has filed what is\nknown as a “continuation patent” application related to\nhis original patent. See 35 U. S. C. §120; 4A D. Chisum,\nPatents §13.03 (2005) (describing continuation applica-\ntions). He argues that, in evaluating this separate appli-\ncation, the patent examiner could be bound by the Texas\ntrial court’s interpretation of the scope of Minton’s original\npatent. See Brief for Respondent 35–36. It is unclear\nwhether this is true. The Patent and Trademark Office’s\nManual of Patent Examining Procedure provides that res\njudicata is a proper ground for rejecting a patent “only\nwhen the earlier decision was a decision of the Board of\nAppeals” or certain federal reviewing courts, giving no\nindication that state court decisions would have preclusive\neffect. See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark\nOffice, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure\n§706.03(w), p. 700–79 (rev. 8th ed. 2012); 35 U. S. C.\n§§134(a), 141, 145; Reply Brief 9–10. In fact, Minton has\nnot identified any case finding such preclusive effect based\non a state court decision. But even assuming that a state\ncourt’s case-within-a-case adjudication may be preclusive\nunder some circumstances, the result would be limited to\nthe parties and patents that had been before the state\ncourt. Such “fact-bound and situation-specific” effects are\nnot sufficient to establish federal arising under jurisdic-\ntion. Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc., supra, at 701.\n   Nor can we accept the suggestion that the federal courts’\ngreater familiarity with patent law means that legal\nmalpractice cases like this one belong in federal court. See\nAir Measurement Technologies, 504 F. 3d, at 1272 (“The\nlitigants will also benefit from federal judges who have\nexperience in claim construction and infringement mat-\nters”); 355 S. W. 3d, at 646 (“patent litigants have an\ninterest in the uniform application of patent law by courts\n12                    GUNN v. MINTON\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwell-versed in that subject matter”). It is true that a\nsimilar interest was among those we considered in Grable.\n545 U. S., at 314. But the possibility that a state court\nwill incorrectly resolve a state claim is not, by itself,\nenough to trigger the federal courts’ exclusive patent\njurisdiction, even if the potential error finds its root in a\nmisunderstanding of patent law.\n  There is no doubt that resolution of a patent issue in the\ncontext of a state legal malpractice action can be vitally\nimportant to the particular parties in that case. But\nsomething more, demonstrating that the question is signif-\nicant to the federal system as a whole, is needed. That is\nmissing here.\n                             D\n   It follows from the foregoing that Grable’s fourth re-\nquirement is also not met. That requirement is concerned\nwith the appropriate “balance of federal and state judicial\nresponsibilities.” Ibid. We have already explained the\nabsence of a substantial federal issue within the meaning\nof Grable. The States, on the other hand, have “a special\nresponsibility for maintaining standards among members\nof the licensed professions.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar\nAssn., 436 U. S. 447, 460 (1978). Their “interest . . . in\nregulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are\nessential to the primary governmental function of admin-\nistering justice, and have historically been officers of the\ncourts.” Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792\n(1975) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have no\nreason to suppose that Congress—in establishing exclu-\nsive federal jurisdiction over patent cases—meant to bar\nfrom state courts state legal malpractice claims simply\nbecause they require resolution of a hypothetical patent\nissue.\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013) \n         13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                        *     *     * \n\n  As we recognized a century ago, “[t]he Federal courts\nhave exclusive jurisdiction of all cases arising under the\npatent laws, but not of all questions in which a patent may\nbe the subject-matter of the controversy.” New Marshall\nEngine Co. v. Marshall Engine Co., 223 U. S. 473, 478\n(1912). In this case, although the state courts must an-\nswer a question of patent law to resolve Minton’s legal\nmalpractice claim, their answer will have no broader\neffects. It will not stand as binding precedent for any\nfuture patent claim; it will not even affect the validity of\nMinton’s patent. Accordingly, there is no “serious federal\ninterest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent\nin a federal forum,” Grable, supra, at 313.
