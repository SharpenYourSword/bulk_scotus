UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                No. 12\u20136142. Decided February 25, 2013\n\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   Statement of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE\nBREYER joins, respecting the denial of the petition for writ\nof certiorari.\n   I write to dispel any doubt whether the Court\u2019s denial of\ncertiorari should be understood to signal our tolerance of a\nfederal prosecutor\u2019s racially charged remark. It should\nnot.\n   Petitioner Bongani Charles Calhoun stood trial in a\nfederal court in Texas for participating in a drug conspir-\nacy. The primary issue was whether Calhoun knew that\nthe friend he had accompanied on a road trip, along with\nthe friend\u2019s associates, were about to engage in a drug\ntransaction, or whether instead Calhoun was merely\npresent during the group\u2019s drive home, when the others\nattempted to purchase cocaine from undercover Drug\nEnforcement Agency (DEA) agents. Two alleged co-\nconspirators who had pleaded guilty testified to Calhoun\u2019s\nknowledge. Law enforcement officers also testified that\nthey discussed the drugs with Calhoun immediately before\nthey broke cover to arrest the group, and that Calhoun\nhad a gun when he was arrested. In his defense, Calhoun\ntestified that he was not part of and had no knowledge of\nhis friend\u2019s plan to purchase drugs, that he did not under-\nstand the DEA agents when they spoke to him in Spanish\nonly, and that he always carried a concealed firearm, as he\n2                CALHOUN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   Statement of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\nwas licensed to do. It was up to the jurors to decide whom\nthey believed.\n   The issue of Calhoun\u2019s intent came to a head when the pros-\necutor cross-examined him. Calhoun related that the\nnight before the arrest, he had detached himself from the\ngroup when his friend arrived at their hotel room with a\nbag of money. He stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d what was\nhappening, and that it \u201cmade me think . . . [t]hat I didn\u2019t\nwant to be there.\u201d Tr. 125\u2013126 (Mar. 8, 2011). (Calhoun\nhad previously testified that he rejoined the group the\nnext morning because he thought they were finally return-\ning home. Id., at 109.) The prosecutor pressed Calhoun\nrepeatedly to explain why he did not want to be in the\nhotel room. Eventually, the District Judge told the prose-\ncutor to move on. That is when the prosecutor asked,\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got African-Americans, you\u2019ve got Hispanics,\nyou\u2019ve got a bag full of money. Does that tell you\u2014a light bulb\ndoesn\u2019t go off in your head and say, This is a drug deal?\u201d\nId., at 127.\n   Calhoun, who is African-American, claims that the\nprosecutor\u2019s racially charged question violated his consti-\ntutional rights. Inexplicably, however, Calhoun\u2019s counsel\ndid not object to the question at trial. So Calhoun\u2019s chal-\nlenge comes to us on plain-error review, under which he\nwould ordinarily have to \u201cdemonstrate that [the error]\n\u2018affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d\nPuckett v. United States, 556 U. S. 129, 135 (2009) (quot-\ning United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 734 (1993)). Yet\nin his petition for writ of certiorari, Calhoun does not\nattempt to make that showing. Instead, Calhoun contends\nthat the comment should lead to automatic reversal be-\ncause it constitutes either structural error or plain error\nregardless of whether it prejudiced the outcome. Those\narguments, however, were forfeited when Calhoun failed\nto press them on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 309, n. 30 (1987). Such argu-\nmentation is an affront to the Constitution\u2019s guarantee\nof equal protection of the laws. And by threatening to\ncultivate bias in the jury, it equally offends the de-\nfendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury. Judge Frank put the\npoint well: \u201cIf government counsel in a criminal suit is\nallowed to inflame the jurors by irrelevantly arousing\ntheir deepest prejudices, the jury may become in his hands\na lethal weapon directed against defendants who may be\ninnocent. He should not be permitted to summon that\nthirteenth juror, prejudice.\u201d United States v. Antonelli\nFireworks Co., 155 F. 2d 631, 659 (CA2 1946) (dissenting\nopinion) (footnote omitted). Thus it is a settled profes-\nsional standard that a \u201cprosecutor should not make argu-\nments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury.\u201d\nABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function\nand Defense Function, Standard 3\u20135.8(c), p. 106 (3d ed.\n1993).\n   By suggesting that race should play a role in establish-\ning a defendant\u2019s criminal intent, the prosecutor here\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The prosecutor\u2019s comment was not an isolated one, but Calhoun\nsimilarly failed to challenge the reprise. During defense counsel\u2019s\nclosing argument, counsel belatedly criticized the prosecutor\u2019s question.\nOn rebuttal, the prosecutor responded: \u201cI got accused by [defense\ncounsel] of, I guess, racially, ethnically profiling people when I asked\nthe question of Mr. Calhoun, Okay, you got African-American[s] and\nHispanics, do you think it\u2019s a drug deal? But there\u2019s one element that\u2019s\nmissing. The money. So what are they doing in this room with a bag\nfull of money? What does your common sense tell you that these people\nare doing in a hotel room with a bag full of money, cash? None of these\npeople are Bill Gates or computer [magnates]?

But it too\nwas pernicious in its attempt to substitute racial stereo-\ntype for evidence, and racial prejudice for reason.\n  It is deeply disappointing to see a representative of the\nUnited States resort to this base tactic more than a decade\ninto the 21st century. Such conduct diminishes the dig-\nnity of our criminal justice system and undermines respect\nfor the rule of law. We expect the Government to seek\njustice, not to fan the flames of fear and prejudice. In\ndischarging the duties of his office in this case, the Assis-\ntant United States Attorney for the Western District of\nTexas missed the mark.\n  Also troubling are the Government\u2019s actions on appeal.\nBefore the Fifth Circuit, the Government failed to recog-\nnize the wrongfulness of the prosecutor\u2019s question, instead\ncalling it only \u201cimpolitic\u201d and arguing that \u201ceven assuming\nthe question crossed the line,\u201d it did not prejudice the\noutcome.
