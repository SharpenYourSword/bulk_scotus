GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11\u20131175. Argued November 7, 2012\u2014Decided February 26, 2013\nPetitioner Marx filed suit, alleging that General Revenue Corporation\n  (GRC) violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by\n  harassing and falsely threatening her in order to collect on a debt.\n  The District Court ruled against Marx and awarded GRC costs pur-\n  suant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 54(d)(1), which gives\n  district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants\n  \u201c[u]nless a federal statute . . . provides otherwise.\u201d Marx sought to\n  vacate the award, arguing that the court\u2019s discretion under Rule\n  54(d)(1) was displaced by 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3), which provides, in\n  pertinent part, that \u201c[o]n a finding by the court that an action under\n  this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harass-\n  ment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees reasona-\n  ble in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d The District Court\n  rejected Marx\u2019s argument. The Tenth Circuit affirmed, in pertinent\n  part, agreeing that costs are allowed under the Rule and concluding\n  that nothing in the statute\u2019s text, history, or purpose indicates that it\n  was meant to displace the Rule.\nHeld: Section \u00a71692k(a)(3) is not contrary to, and, thus, does not dis-\n place a district court\u2019s discretion to award costs under, Rule 54(d)(1).\n Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) Rule 54(d)(1) gives courts discretion to award costs to prevailing\n parties, but this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or\n FRCP that \u201cprovides otherwise,\u201d i.e., is \u201ccontrary\u201d to Rule 54(d)(1).\n Contrary to the argument of Marx and the United States, as amicus,\n language of the original 1937 version of the Rule does not suggest\n that any \u201cexpress provision\u201d for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1),\n regardless of whether it is contrary to the Rule. Pp. 4\u20137.\n    (b) Section 1692k(a)(3)\u2019s language and context demonstrate that\n2                 MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the provision is not contrary to Rule 54(d)(1). Pp. 7\u201315.\n         (1) GRC argues that since \u00a71692k(a)(3) does not address whether\n    costs may be awarded in an FDCPA case brought in good faith, it\n    does not set forth a standard that is contrary to the Rule and there-\n    fore does not displace the presumption that a court has discretion to\n    award costs. Marx and the United States concede that the statute\n    does not expressly limit a court\u2019s discretion to award costs under the\n    Rule, but argue that it does so by negative implication. They claim\n    that unless \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which to\n    award costs, the phrase \u201cand costs\u201d would be superfluous with Rule\n    54(d)(1). And the United States also argues that \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s more\n    specific cost statute displaces Rule 54(d)(1)\u2019s more general rule.\n    Pp. 7\u20139.\n         (2) The argument of Marx and the United States depends criti-\n    cally on whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s allowance of costs creates a negative\n    implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.\n    The expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply \u201cunless it\n    is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility\n    and meant to say no to it,\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S.\n    149, 168, and can be overcome by \u201ccontrary indications that adopting\n    a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any ex-\n    clusion,\u201d United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65. Here, context indi-\n    cates that Congress did not intend \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts\n    from awarding costs under the Rule. First, under the American Rule,\n    each litigant generally pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, but the Court\n    has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award\n    attorney\u2019s fees in a narrow set of circumstances, e.g., when a party\n    brings an action in bad faith. The statute is thus best read as codify-\n    ing a court\u2019s pre-existing authority to award both attorney\u2019s fees and\n    costs. Next, \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s second sentence must be understood in\n    light of its first, which provides an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs,\n    but to prevailing plaintiffs. By adding \u201cand costs\u201d to the second sen-\n    tence, Congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only re-\n    cover attorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and\n    removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as at-\n    torney\u2019s fees in such cases. Finally, \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s language sharply\n    contrasts with that of other statutes in which Congress has placed\n    conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g., 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a71928. Pp. 9\u201312.\n         (3) Even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct, the\n    canon against surplusage is not absolute. First, the canon \u201cassists\n    only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause\n    and word of a statute.\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. Here, no interpretation of \u00a71692k(a)(3) gives effect to\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  every word. Second, redundancy is not unusual in statutes address-\n  ing costs. See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a72607(d)(5). Finally, the canon is\n  strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another\n  part of the same statutory scheme. Because \u00a71692k(a)(3) is not part\n  of Rule 54(d)(1), the force of this canon is diminished. Pp. 13\u201314.\n       (4) Lastly, contrary to the United States\u2019 claim that specific cost-\n  shifting standards displace general ones, the context of the statute\n  indicates that Congress was simply confirming the background pre-\n  sumption that courts may award to defendants attorney\u2019s fees and\n  costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith. Because Marx\n  did not bring this suit in bad faith, the specific provision is not appli-\n  cable.

GENERAL REVENUE\n               CORPORATION\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT\n                             [February 26, 2013]\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) gives district\ncourts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants\n\u201c[u]nless a federal statute . . . provides otherwise.\u201d The\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 91 Stat. 881,\n15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3), provides that \u201c[o]n a finding by\nthe court that an action under this section was brought\nin bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court\nmay award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees reasonable in\nrelation to the work expended and costs.\u201d This case pre-\nsents the question whether \u00a71692k(a)(3) \u201cprovides other-\nwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1). We conclude that \u00a71692k(a)(3)\ndoes not \u201cprovid[e] otherwise,\u201d and thus a district court\nmay award costs to prevailing defendants in FDCPA cases\nwithout finding that the plaintiff brought the case in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\n                          I\n  Petitioner Olivea Marx defaulted on a student loan\nguaranteed by EdFund, a division of the California Stu-\ndent Aid Commission. In September 2008, EdFund hired\nrespondent General Revenue Corporation (GRC) to collect\n2               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debt. One month later, Marx filed an FDCPA en-\nforcement action against GRC.1 Marx alleged that GRC\nhad violated the FDCPA by harassing her with phone calls\nseveral times a day and falsely threatening to garnish up\nto 50% of her wages and to take the money she owed\ndirectly from her bank account. Shortly after the com-\nplaint was filed, GRC made an offer of judgment under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 to pay Marx $1,500,\nplus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, to settle any\nclaims she had against it. Marx did not respond to the\noffer. She subsequently amended her complaint to add\na claim that GRC unlawfully sent a fax to her workplace\nthat requested information about her employment status.\n  Following a 1-day bench trial, the District Court found\nthat Marx had failed to prove any violation of the FDCPA.\nAs the prevailing party, GRC submitted a bill of costs\nseeking $7,779.16 in witness fees, witness travel expenses,\nand deposition transcript fees. The court disallowed sev-\neral items of costs and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 54(d)(1), ordered Marx to pay GRC $4,543.03.\nMarx filed a motion to vacate the award of costs, arguing\nthat the court lacked authority to award costs under Rules\n54(d)(1) and 68(d) because 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets\nforth the exclusive basis for awarding costs in FDCPA\ncases.2 Section 1692k(a)(3) provides, in relevant part: \u201cOn\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The FDCPA is a consumer protection statute that prohibits certain\n\nabusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71692. The FDCPA\u2019s private-enforcement provision, \u00a71692k, author-\nizes any aggrieved person to recover damages from \u201cany debt collector\nwho fails to comply with any provision\u201d of the FDCPA. \u00a71692k(a).\n   2 Under Rule 68(d), if a defendant makes a settlement offer, and the\n\nplaintiff rejects it and later obtains a judgment that is less favorable\nthan the one offered her, the plaintiff must pay the costs incurred by\nthe defendant after the offer was made. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(d)\n(\u201cIf the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable\nthan the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after\nthe offer was made\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na finding by the court that an action under this section\nwas brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harass-\nment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s\nfees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d\nMarx argued that because the court had not found that\nshe brought the case in bad faith and for the purpose\nof harassment, GRC was not entitled to costs. The Dis-\ntrict Court rejected Marx\u2019s argument, concluding that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) does not displace a court\u2019s discretion to award\ncosts under Rule 54(d)(1) and that costs should also be\nawarded under Rule 68(d).\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed but agreed only with part\nof the District Court\u2019s reasoning. In particular, the court\ndisagreed that costs were allowed under Rule 68(d). 668\nF. 3d 1174, 1182 (2011). It explained that \u201cRule 68 applies\nonly where the district court enters judgment in favor of\na plaintiff \u201d for less than the amount of the settlement offer\nand not where the plaintiff loses outright. Ibid. (citing\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 352 (1981)).\nBecause the District Court had not entered judgment in\nfavor of Marx, the court concluded that costs were not\nallowed under Rule 68(d). 668 F. 3d, at 1182. Neverthe-\nless, the court found that costs were allowed under Rule\n54(d)(1), which grants district courts discretion to award\ncosts to prevailing parties unless a federal statute or the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide otherwise. Id., at\n1178, 1182. After describing the \u201cvenerable\u201d presumption\nthat prevailing parties are entitled to costs, id., at 1179,\nthe court concluded that nothing in the text, history, or\npurpose of \u00a71692k(a)(3) indicated that it was meant to\ndisplace Rule 54(d)(1), id., at 1178\u20131182. Judge Lucero\ndissented, arguing that \u201c[t]he only sensible reading of\n[\u00a71692k(a)(3)] is that the district court may only award\ncosts to a defendant\u201d upon finding that the action was\nbrought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment\nand that to read it otherwise rendered the phrase \u201cand\n4               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncosts\u201d superfluous. Id., at 1187 (emphasis in original).\n  We granted certiorari, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nconflict among the Circuits regarding whether a prevailing\ndefendant in an FDCPA case may be awarded costs where\nthe lawsuit was not brought in bad faith and for the pur-\npose of harassment. Compare 668 F. 3d, at 1182 (case\nbelow), with Rouse v. Law Offices of Rory Clark, 603 F. 3d\n699, 701 (CA9 2010). We now affirm the judgment of the\nTenth Circuit.\n                             II\n   As in all statutory construction cases, we \u201c \u2018assum[e]\nthat the ordinary meaning of [the statutory] language\naccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d Hardt v. Re-\nliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 8) (quoting Gross v. FBL Financial Services,\nInc., 557 U. S. 167, 175 (2009) (alteration in original)). In\nthis case, we must construe both Rule 54(d)(1) and\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) and assess the relationship between them.\n                              A\n  Rule 54(d)(1) is straightforward. It provides, in relevant\npart: \u201cUnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court or-\nder provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than attorney\u2019s fees\u2014\nshould be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d\n  As the Tenth Circuit correctly recognized, Rule 54(d)(1)\ncodifies a venerable presumption that prevailing parties\nare entitled to costs.3 Notwithstanding this presumption,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Prior to the adoption of the federal rules, prevailing parties were\n\nentitled to costs as of right in actions at law while courts had discretion\nto award costs in equity proceedings. See Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S.\n300, 317\u2013318 (1920) (\u201cWhile in equity proceedings the allowance and\nimposition of costs is, unless controlled by statute or rule of court, a\nmatter of discretion, it has been uniformly held that in actions at law\nthe prevailing party is entitled to costs as of right, except in those few\ncases where by express statutory provision or by established principles\ncosts are denied\u201d (citation omitted)); Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe word \u201cshould\u201d makes clear that the decision whether\nto award costs ultimately lies within the sound discretion\nof the district court. See Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (\u201cFederal\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the discretion\nto award costs to prevailing parties\u201d). Rule 54(d)(1) also\nmakes clear, however, that this discretion can be displaced\nby a federal statute or a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\nthat \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d\n   A statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1) if it is\n\u201ccontrary\u201d to the Rule. See 10 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal\nPractice \u00a754.101[1][c], p. 54\u2013159 (3d ed. 2012) (hereinafter\n10 Moore\u2019s). Because the Rule grants district courts dis-\ncretion to award costs, a statute is contrary to the Rule if\nit limits that discretion. A statute may limit a court\u2019s dis-\ncretion in several ways, and it need not expressly state\nthat it is displacing Rule 54(d)(1) to do so. For instance,\na statute providing that \u201cplaintiffs shall not be liable for\ncosts\u201d is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) because it precludes a\ncourt from awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See,\ne.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a718(d)(1) (\u201cThe petitioner shall not be liable\nfor costs in the district court\u201d). Similarly, a statute provid-\ning that plaintiffs may recover costs only under certain\nconditions is contrary to Rule 54(d) because it precludes a\ncourt from awarding costs to prevailing plaintiffs when\nthose conditions have not been satisfied. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71928 (\u201c[N]o costs shall be included in such judg-\nment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office\u201d).\n   Importantly, not all statutes that provide for costs are\ncontrary to Rule 54(d)(1). A statute providing that \u201cthe\ncourt may award costs to the prevailing party,\u201d for exam-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nSwan, 111 U. S. 379, 387 (1884) (\u201c[B]y the long established practice and\n\nuniversally recognized rule of the common law, in actions at law, the \n\nprevailing party is entitled to recover a judgment for costs . . . \u201d). \n\n6            MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple, is not contrary to the Rule because it does not limit a\ncourt\u2019s discretion. See 10 Moore\u2019s \u00a754.101[1][c], at 54\u2013159\n(\u201cA number of statutes state simply that the court may\naward costs in its discretion. Such a provision is not con-\ntrary to Rule 54(d)(1) and does not displace the court\u2019s\ndiscretion under the Rule\u201d).\n   Marx and the United States as amicus curiae suggest\nthat any statute that specifically provides for costs dis-\nplaces Rule 54(d)(1), regardless of whether it is contrary to\nthe Rule. Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 11\u201312 (hereinafter Brief for United\nStates). The United States relies on the original 1937\nversion of Rule 54(d)(1), which provided, \u201c \u2018Except when\nexpress provision therefor is made either in a statute of\nthe United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed\nas of course to the prevailing party unless the court oth-\nerwise directs.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 12 (quoting Rule). Though the\nRules Committee updated the language of Rule 54(d)(1) in\n2007, the change was \u201cstylistic only.\u201d Advisory Commit-\ntee\u2019s Notes, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 734 (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nAccordingly, the United States asserts that any \u201cexpress\nprovision\u201d for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1).\n   We are not persuaded, however, that the original ver-\nsion of Rule 54(d) should be interpreted as Marx and the\nUnited States suggest. The original language was meant\nto ensure that Rule 54(d) did not displace existing costs\nprovisions that were contrary to the Rule. Under the prior\nlanguage, statutes that simply permitted a court to award\ncosts did not displace the Rule. See 6 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s\nFederal Practice \u00a754.71[1], p. 54\u2013304 (2d ed. 1996)\n(\u201c[W]hen permissive language is used [in a statute regard-\ning costs] the district court may, pursuant to Rule 54(d),\nexercise a sound discretion relative to the allowance of\ncosts\u201d). Rather, statutes had to set forth a standard for\nawarding costs that was different from Rule 54(d)(1) in\norder to displace the Rule. See Friedman v. Ganassi, 853\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 2d 207, 210 (CA3 1988) (holding that 15 U. S. C. \u00a777k(e)\nis not an \u201cexpress provision\u201d under Rule 54(d) because it\ndoes not provide an \u201calternative standard\u201d for awarding\ntaxable costs). The original version of Rule 54(d) is con-\nsistent with our conclusion that a statute must be contrary\nto Rule 54(d)(1) in order to displace it.4\n                            B\n  We now turn to whether \u00a71692k(a)(3) is contrary to Rule\n54(d)(1). The language of \u00a71692k(a)(3) and the context\nsurrounding it persuade us that it is not.\n                             1\n   The second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) provides: \u201cOn a\nfinding by the court that an action under this section was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent provides no stable definition of \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d\nFirst, it argues that a statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d if it is \u201cdifferent\u201d\nfrom Rule 54(d)(1). Post, at 2 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). That inter-\npretation renders the Rule meaningless because every statute is \u201cdif-\nferent\u201d insofar as it is not an exact copy of the Rule. Next, it argues\nthat a statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d if it is an \u201c \u2018express provision\u2019\nrelating to costs.\u201d Post, at 2\u20133. Under that view, a statute providing\nthat \u201cthe court may award costs to the prevailing party\u201d would \u201cprovide\notherwise.\u201d We do not think such a statute provides otherwise\u2014it\nprovides \u201csame-wise,\u201d and the treatise on which the dissent relies\nsupports our view. See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a72670, p. 258 (3d ed. 1998 and Supp. 2012)\n(\u201c[Statutes that] are permissive in character . . . are not inconsistent\nwith the discretion given the district court by Rule 54(d)\u201d). Finally,\nthe dissent seems to implicitly accept that \u201cotherwise\u201d means \u201cto the\ncontrary\u201d in the course of arguing that a doctor\u2019s instruction to take\nmedication \u201c \u2018in the morning\u2019 \u201d would supersede an instruction on the\nmedication label to \u201c \u2018take [it] twice a day unless otherwise directed,\u2019 \u201d\nbecause the patient would understand the doctor\u2019s advice to mean that\nhe should take the medicine \u201conce a day, each morning.\u201d Post, at 4. If\nthe patient understands the doctor to mean \u201conce a day, each morning,\u201d\nwe agree that such advice would \u201cprovide otherwise,\u201d because the\ndoctor\u2019s order would be \u201ccontrary\u201d to the label\u2019s instruction. For the\nreasons set forth in Part II\u2013B, however, we are not convinced that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) is \u201ccontrary\u201d to Rule 54(d)(1).\n8               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,\nthe court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees\nreasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d5\n  GRC contends that the statute does not address whether\ncosts may be awarded in this case\u2014where the plaintiff\nbrought the case in good faith\u2014and thus it does not set\nforth a standard for awarding costs that is contrary to\nRule 54(d)(1). In its view, Congress intended \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nto deter plaintiffs from bringing nuisance lawsuits. It,\ntherefore, expressly provided that when plaintiffs bring an\naction in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the\ncourt may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the defend-\nant. The statute does address this type of case\u2014i.e., cases\nin which the plaintiff brings the action in bad faith and\nfor the purpose of harassment. But it is silent where bad\nfaith and purpose of harassment are absent, and silence\ndoes not displace the background rule that a court has\ndiscretion to award costs.\n  Marx and the United States take the contrary view.\nThey concede that the language does not expressly limit\na court\u2019s discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d)(1),\nBrief for Petitioner 10; Brief for United States 19, but\nargue that it does so by negative implication. Invoking the\nexpressio unius canon of statutory construction, they\ncontend that by specifying that a court may award attor-\nney\u2019s fees and costs when an action is brought in bad faith\nand for the purpose of harassment, Congress intended to\npreclude a court from awarding fees and costs when bad\nfaith and purpose of harassment are absent. They further\nargue that unless \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 It is undisputed that GRC is not entitled to costs under \u00a71692k(a)(3)\n\nbecause the District Court did not find that Marx brought this action in\nbad faith. But Rule 54(d)(1) independently authorizes district courts to\naward costs to prevailing parties. The question in this case is not\nwhether costs are allowed under \u00a71692k(a)(3) but whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nprecludes an award of costs under Rule 54(d)(1).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbasis on which a court may award costs, the phrase \u201cand\ncosts\u201d would be superfluous. According to this argument,\nCongress would have had no reason to specify that a court\nmay award costs when a plaintiff brings an action in\nbad faith if it could have nevertheless awarded costs under\nRule 54(d)(1). Finally, the United States argues that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) is a more specific cost statute that displaces\nRule 54(d)(1)\u2019s more general rule.\n  The context surrounding \u00a71692k(a)(3) persuades us that\nGRC\u2019s interpretation is correct.\n                              2\n   The argument of Marx and the United States depends\ncritically on whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s allowance of costs\ncreates a negative implication that costs are unavailable\nin any other circumstances. The force of any negative\nimplication, however, depends on context. We have long\nheld that the expressio unius canon does not apply \u201cunless\nit is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed\npossibility and meant to say no to it,\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody\nCoal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003), and that the canon\ncan be overcome by \u201ccontrary indications that adopting a\nparticular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal\nany exclusion,\u201d United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65\n(2002). In this case, context persuades us that Congress\ndid not intend \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from award-\ning costs under Rule 54(d)(1).\n   First, the background presumptions governing attorney\u2019s\nfees and costs are a highly relevant contextual feature.\nAs already explained, under Rule 54(d)(1) a prevailing\nparty is entitled to recover costs from the losing party\nunless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure, or a court order \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d The opposite\npresumption exists with respect to attorney\u2019s fees. Under\nthe \u201cbedrock principle known as the \u2018 \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c[e]ach litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose,\n10             MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nunless a statute or contract provides otherwise.\u201d Hardt,\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Ruckelshaus v.\nSierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 683 (1983)). Notwithstanding\nthe American Rule, however, we have long recognized that\nfederal courts have inherent power to award attorney\u2019s\nfees in a narrow set of circumstances, including when a\nparty brings an action in bad faith. See Chambers v.\nNASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 45\u201346 (1991) (explaining that\na court has inherent power to award attorney\u2019s fees to a\nparty whose litigation efforts directly benefit others, to\nsanction the willful disobedience of a court order, and to\nsanction a party who has acted in bad faith, vexatiously,\nwantonly, or for oppressive reasons); Alyeska Pipeline\nService Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 257\u2013259\n(1975) (same).\n  It is undisputed that \u00a71692k(a)(3) leaves the back-\nground rules for attorney\u2019s fees intact. The statute pro-\nvides that when the plaintiff brings an action in bad\nfaith, the court may award attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant.\nBut, as noted, a court has inherent power to award fees\nbased on a litigant\u2019s bad faith even without \u00a71692k(a)(3).\nSee Chambers, supra, at 45\u201346. Because \u00a71692k(a)(3)\ncodifies the background rule for attorney\u2019s fees, it is dubi-\nous to infer congressional intent to override the back-\nground rule with respect to costs. The statute is best read\nas codifying a court\u2019s pre-existing authority to award both\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs.6\n  Next, the second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) must be un-\nderstood in light of the sentence that precedes it.7 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Indeed, had Congress intended \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose a court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion to award costs, it could not have chosen a more circuitous\nway to do so. The statute sets forth the circumstances in which a court\n\u201cmay\u201d award costs. But under Marx\u2019s and the United States\u2019 view, the\nonly consequence of the statute is to set forth the circumstances in\nwhich it may not award costs.\n  7 Section 1692k(a) provides:\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) provides that defendants\nwho violate the FDCPA are liable for the plaintiff \u2019s attor-\nney\u2019s fees and costs. The second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nsimilarly provides that plaintiffs who bring an action in\nbad faith and for the purpose of harassment may be liable\nfor the defendant\u2019s fees and costs.\n   If Congress had excluded \u201cand costs\u201d in the second sen-\ntence, plaintiffs might have argued that the expression of\ncosts in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in\nthe second meant that defendants could only recover\nattorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith.\nBy adding \u201cand costs\u201d to the second sentence, Congress\nforeclosed that argument, thereby removing any doubt\nthat defendants may recover costs as well as attorney\u2019s\nfees when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith. See Ali v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 226 (2008) (ex-\nplaining that a phrase is not superfluous if used to \u201cre-\nmove . . . doubt\u201d about an issue); Fort Stewart Schools v.\nFLRA, 495 U. S. 641, 646 (1990) (explaining that \u201ctechni-\ncally unnecessary\u201d examples may have been \u201cinserted out\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this section, any debt collector who\nfails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to\nany person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of\u2014\n   \u201c(1) any actual damages sustained by such person as a result of such\nfailure;\n   \u201c(2)(A) in the case of any action by an individual, such additional\ndamages as the court may allow, but not exceeding $1,000; or\n   \u201c(B) in the case of a class action, (i) such amount for each named\nplaintiff as could be recovered under subparagraph (A), and (ii) such\namount as the court may allow for all other class members, without\nregard to a minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the lesser of\n$500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector; and\n   \u201c(3) in the case of any successful action to enforce the foregoing\nliability, the costs of the action, together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s\nfee as determined by the court. On a finding by the court that an action\nunder this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of\nharassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees\nreasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d\n12             MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof an abundance of caution\u201d). The fact that there might\nhave been a negative implication that costs are precluded,\ndepending on whether Congress included or excluded the\nphrase \u201cand costs,\u201d weighs against giving effect to any\nimplied limitation.\n   Finally, the language in \u00a71692k(a)(3) sharply contrasts\nwith other statutes in which Congress has placed condi-\ntions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71928 (\u201c[N]o costs shall be included in such\njudgment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in\nthe United States Patent and Trademark Office prior to\nthe commencement of the action\u201d (emphasis added)); 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (\u201c[I]n any action brought against a judi-\ncial officer . . . such officer shall not be held liable for any\ncosts . . . unless such action was clearly in excess of such\nofficer\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Although Congress need not use explicit language to\nlimit a court\u2019s discretion under Rule 54(d)(1), its use of\nexplicit language in other statutes cautions against infer-\nring a limitation in \u00a71692k(a)(3). These statutes confirm\nthat Congress knows how to limit a court\u2019s discretion\nunder Rule 54(d)(1) when it so desires. See Small v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 385, 398 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019 explicit use of [language]\nin other provisions shows that it specifies such restrictions\nwhen it wants to do so\u201d). Had Congress intended the\nsecond sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) to displace Rule 54(d)(1),\nit could have easily done so by using the word \u201conly\u201d be-\nfore setting forth the condition \u201c[o]n a finding by the court\nthat an action . . . was brought in bad faith and for the\npurpose of harassment . . . .\u201d8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Marx also suggests that \u00a71692k(a)(3) is similar to the Pipeline\n\nSafety Act, 49 U. S. C. \u00a760121(b), which provides: \u201cThe court may award\ncosts to a prevailing defendant when the action is unreasonable, frivo-\nlous, or meritless.\u201d We have never had occasion to interpret \u00a760121(b)\nand its interaction with Rule 54(d)(1).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                3\n    As the above discussion suggests, we also are not per-\nsuaded by Marx\u2019s objection that our interpretation renders\nthe phrase \u201cand costs\u201d superfluous. As noted, supra, at 11,\nthe phrase \u201cand costs\u201d would not be superfluous if Con-\ngress included it to remove doubt that defendants may\nrecover costs when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith. But\neven assuming that our interpretation renders the phrase\n\u201cand costs\u201d superfluous, that would not alter our conclu-\nsion. The canon against surplusage is not an absolute\nrule, see Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Mur-\nphy, 548 U. S. 291, 299, n. 1 (2006) (\u201cWhile it is generally\npresumed that statutes do not contain surplusage, in-\nstances of surplusage are not unknown\u201d); Connecticut Nat.\nBank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992) (\u201cRedundan-\ncies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting\n. . . \u201d), and it has considerably less force in this case.\n    First, the canon against surplusage \u201cassists only where\na competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But, in this case, no interpretation of\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) gives effect to every word. Both Marx and\nthe United States admit that a court has inherent power\nto award attorney\u2019s fees to a defendant when the plaintiff\nbrings an action in bad faith. Because there was, conse-\nquently, no need for Congress to specify that courts have\nthis power, \u00a71692k(a)(3) is superfluous insofar as it ad-\ndresses attorney\u2019s fees. In light of this redundancy, we are\nnot overly concerned that the reference to costs may be\nredundant as well.\n    Second, redundancy is \u201chardly unusual\u201d in statutes\naddressing costs. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Numer-\nous statutes overlap with Rule 54(d)(1). See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. \u00a72607(d)(5) (\u201c[T]he court may award to the pre-\nvailing party the court costs of the action\u201d); \u00a75565(b) (2006\n14           MARX v.

Marx and the United\nStates contend that Congress intended to limit a court\u2019s discretion to\naward costs to prevailing defendants because FDCPA plaintiffs are\noften poor and may be deterred from challenging unlawful debt collec-\ntion practices by the possibility of being held liable for the defendant\u2019s\ncosts. This purposive argument cannot overcome the language and\ncontext of \u00a71692k(a)(3), but even if it could, we find it unpersuasive.\nRule 54(d)(1) does not require courts to award costs to prevailing\ndefendants. District courts may appropriately consider an FDCPA\nplaintiff\u2019s indigency in deciding whether to award costs. See Badillo v.\nCentral Steel & Wire Co., 717 F. 2d 1160, 1165 (CA7 1983) (\u201c[I]t is\nwithin the discretion of the district court to consider a plaintiff\u2019s indi-\ngency in denying costs under Rule 54(d)\u201d).\n16          MARX v.

This default, how-\never, gives way when a federal statute includes a costs\nprovision that \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d The Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act (FDCPA), 91 Stat. 874, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692\net seq., contains a costs provision, \u00a71692k(a)(3), and it\n\u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d That is apparent from the statute\u2019s\nplain language, which limits a court\u2019s discretion to award\ncosts to prevailing defendants to cases \u201cbrought in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\u201d In reaching the\nopposite conclusion, the Court ignores the plain meaning\nof both the FDCPA and Rule 54(d)(1) and renders the\nstatutory language at issue in this case meaningless. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n                           I\n  The majority correctly recognizes, see ante, at 4, the\nfundamental principle of statutory construction that we\nbegin \u201cwith the language of the statute itself.\u201d United\nStates v.

We presume that Congress \u201cmeans in a statute\nwhat it says there,\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain,\n503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992), and \u201cwhere . . . the statute\u2019s\nlanguage is plain, the sole function of the courts is to\nenforce it according to its terms.\u201d Ron Pair, 489 U. S., at\n241 (internal quotation marks omitted). This basic tenet\nis the appropriate starting point for interpreting both Rule\n54(d)(1) and \u00a71692k(a)(3). After invoking this principle,\nhowever, the majority casts it aside entirely in interpret-\ning the statute and the Rule.\n                               A\n   Rule 54(d)(1) states, as relevant here, that \u201c[u]nless a\nfederal statute . . . provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than\nattorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.\u201d The first question is what it means for a statute\nto \u201cprovid[e] otherwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1).\n   Because the phrase \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d is not defined\nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we look to its\nordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513\nU. S. 179, 187 (1995). In common usage, to \u201cprovide oth-\nerwise\u201d means to \u201cmake a . . . stipulation\u201d that is \u201cdiffer-\nen[t].\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1598, 1827 (2002) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defining \u201cprovide\u201d\nand \u201cotherwise,\u201d respectively); see Random House Diction-\nary of the English Language 1372, 1556 (2d ed. 1987)\n(Random House) (\u201cto arrange for or stipulate\u201d \u201c[i]n another\nmanner\u201d); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1989)\n(Oxford Dictionary); 12 id., at 713 (\u201cto stipulate\u201d \u201c[i]n\nanother way . . . ; in a different manner\u201d). This reading of\nthe plain text is confirmed by the original 1937 codifica-\ntion of the Rule, which made clear that any \u201cexpress pro-\nvision\u201d relating to costs in a statute is sufficient to displace\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

If Congress has enacted a provision with\nrespect to costs in a statute, there is no longer any need\nfor the default, so it gives way. This design of the Rule is\nsensible, because many statutes contain specific costs\nprovisions. 10 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a754.101[1][c], p.\n54\u2013160 (3d ed. 2012) (noting that such statutes \u201care far\ntoo numerous to list comprehensively\u201d). Rule 54(d)(1) is\ntherefore consistent with the canon of statutory interpre-\ntation that \u201ca precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts\nmore general remedies.\u201d Hinck v. United States, 550 U. S.\n501, 506 (2007); Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons,\nInc., 482 U. S. 437, 445 (1987); United States v. Erika,\nInc., 456 U. S. 201, 208 (1982).\n  While purporting to interpret the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of\nRule 54(d)(1), ante, at 4, the majority immediately aban-\ndons the ordinary meaning. The majority concludes that a\nstatute provides otherwise for purposes of Rule 54(d)(1)\nonly if it is \u201ccontrary\u201d to the default. Ante, at 5. But the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  original codification of the Rule provided that \u201c[e]xcept when\nexpress provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United\nStates or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the\nprevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d Ante, at 6 (quoting\nthe Rule; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). The\nlanguage in the Rule was later revised to its current form in 2007, but\nas the majority acknowledges, the Rules Committee indicated the\nchanges were \u201c \u2018stylistic only.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.

See ante, 6\u20137 (citing 6 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s\nFederal Practice, p. 54\u2013304 (2d ed. 1996)).\n   \u201cOtherwise\u201d means \u201cdifferent.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 1518;\nsee supra, at 2\u20133. The majority\u2019s preferred term of art,\n\u201ccontrary,\u201d sets a higher bar; it signifies \u201cthe opposite,\u201d\nor \u201ca proposition, fact, or condition incompatible with an-\nother.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third 495 (emphasis added).

In \u00a71692k(a)(3), Con-\ngress described with specificity a single circumstance in\nwhich costs may be awarded. Far from merely restating a\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion to award costs, this provision\nimposes a prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion: a\nfinding by the court that an action was brought in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\n   Because the text is plain, there is no need to proceed\nany further. Even so, relevant canons of statutory inter-\npretation lend added support to reading \u00a71692k(a)(3) as\nhaving a negative implication. That reading accords with\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon, which in-\nstructs that when Congress includes one possibility in a\nstatute, it excludes another by implication. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U. S. 73, 80\u201381 (2002).\nThis rule reinforces what the text makes clear. By limit-\ning a court\u2019s discretion to award costs to cases brought in\nbad faith or for the purpose of harassment, Congress\n6               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nforeclosed the award of costs in other circumstances.4\n   Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute is also strongly\nfavored by the rule that statutes should be read to avoid\nsuperfluity. Under this \u201cmost basic of interpretative\ncanons, . . . \u2018 \u201c[a] statute should be constructed so that\neffect is given to all of its provisions, so that no part will be\ninoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Corley\nv. United States, 556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs\nv. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004)). Respondent\u2019s reading,\nas it mostly acknowledges, renders the entire sentence\nmeaningless because it reiterates powers that federal\ncourts already possess with respect to both costs and\nattorney\u2019s fees. See Brief for Respondent 22\u201324.\n   The majority rejects this argument, citing the rule that\nthis canon \u201c \u2018assists only where a competing interpretation\ngives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 13 (quoting Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12)). In its view, neither\nof the available interpretations can eliminate superfluity\nbecause the attorney\u2019s fees provision is redundant under\nany reading. Ante, at 13. But the canon against super-\nfluity surely counsels against an interpretation that renders\nthe entire provision at issue superfluous when a compet-\ning interpretation would at least render part of the provi-\nsion meaningful. Nor does the majority\u2019s observation that\nredundancy is \u201c \u2018hardly unusual,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 14, in provi-\nsions relating to costs make the canon inapplicable. While\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority suggests that this canon does not apply to \u00a71692k(a)(3)\n\nbecause it only aids where \u201c \u2018it is fair to suppose that Congress consid-\nered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9\n(quoting Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003)). The\nbest evidence of congressional intent, however, is the statutory text\nthat Congress enacted. West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,\n499 U. S. 83, 98 (1991). And here, the plain language of \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nmakes it clear that Congress meant to foreclose other possible mean-\nings.

In Cooper Industries, Inc.\nv. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166 (2004) (opinion\nfor the Court by THOMAS, J.), we considered a provision in\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa-\ntion, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(f)(1) that\nprovided: \u201c[a]ny person may seek contribution . . . during\n. . . any civil action under section 9606 of this title\u201d (em-\nphasis added). We rejected the argument that the word\n\u201cmay\u201d indicated that \u201cduring a civil action\u201d was one but\nnot the exclusive circumstance in which the right of con-\ntribution was available. 543 U. S., at 166. We instead\nadopted the natural reading of the text, holding that a\nparty\u2019s ability to seek contribution was limited by the\nphrase \u201cduring any civil action\u201d and that contribution was\nonly available while a lawsuit is pending. Ibid. The same\nlogic applies here, because \u00a71692k(a)(3) imposes a closely\nanalogous condition on a court\u2019s discretion to award costs.\n                           2\n   The first sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) underscores that\nCongress implemented a different rule than Rule 54(d)(1).\nThat sentence provides that a debt collector who violates\nthe FDCPA is \u201cliable to\u201d a prevailing plaintiff for \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 See, e.g., 15 U.

Cf. Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.,\n566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4). Because Congress\ndeviated from Rule 54(d)(1) in the first sentence of\n\u00a71692k(a)(3), the most reasonable reading is that the\nsentence that immediately follows, which states the rule\nfor prevailing defendants, takes a similar path.\n   The majority believes that its reading of the costs provi-\nsion follows from the first sentence as well, but for a dif-\nferent reason. Ante, at 11\u201312. It suggests that if Congress\nhad not included costs in the second sentence, a plaintiff\nmight have been able to argue that the inclusion of costs\nin the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the\nsecond indicated that defendants could recover only fees\nwhen an action is brought in bad faith. The majority then\nspeculates that Congress included costs in the second\nsentence to foreclose that argument.\n   The text of the previous sentence makes plain, however,\nthat the second sentence departs from the Rule 54(d)(1)\ndefault, and the majority offers no evidence in support of\nits supposition that Congress intended a different mean-\ning.6 Moreover, I see no basis for invoking potential con-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 The majority does not explain why its speculation about legislative\n\nintent is more persuasive than the Solicitor General\u2019s view that sad-\ndling potential plaintiffs with costs would undermine the FDCPA\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018calibrated scheme\u2019 \u201d of enforcement.

Under the\nSolicitor General\u2019s interpretation, because the recoveries in these cases\nare not certain to be large, consumers may be deterred from bringing\nFDCPA claims if they are faced with the risk of paying costs.

Aniskoff, 507 U. S. 511, 519\n(1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). But speculat-\ning whole cloth about congressional intent, as the majority\ndoes, is surely more problematic. The majority is saved\nthe trouble of having to look for its friends at the party; it\nsimply invites them.\n                              II\n   Reduced to its essence, the majority\u2019s analysis turns on\nreading \u00a71692k(a)(3) in the context of what it calls the\n\u201cvenerable presumption\u201d that prevailing parties are enti-\ntled to costs. See ante, at 4. Even if it were appropriate to\nconsider a background presumption rather than reading\nthe plain text at issue, the majority\u2019s characterization of\nthe presumption is at best incomplete.\n   First, the Court\u2019s suggestion that the presumption\nregarding costs is a \u201cvenerable\u201d one in American law is an\noverstatement. Ibid. It is true, as the majority points out,\nthat prior to the federal rules, \u201cprevailing parties were\nentitled to costs as of right in actions at law while courts\nhad discretion to award costs in equity proceedings.\u201d Ante,\nat 4, n. 3; see Wright & Miller \u00a72665, at 199.

Argued November 7, 2012\u2014Decided February 26, 2013\nPetitioner Marx filed suit, alleging that General Revenue Corporation\n  (GRC) violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by\n  harassing and falsely threatening her in order to collect on a debt.\n  The District Court ruled against Marx and awarded GRC costs pur-\n  suant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 54(d)(1), which gives\n  district courts discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants\n  \u201c[u]nless a federal statute . . . provides otherwise.\u201d Marx sought to\n  vacate the award, arguing that the court\u2019s discretion under Rule\n  54(d)(1) was displaced by 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3), which provides, in\n  pertinent part, that \u201c[o]n a finding by the court that an action under\n  this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harass-\n  ment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees reasona-\n  ble in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d The District Court\n  rejected Marx\u2019s argument. The Tenth Circuit affirmed, in pertinent\n  part, agreeing that costs are allowed under the Rule and concluding\n  that nothing in the statute\u2019s text, history, or purpose indicates that it\n  was meant to displace the Rule.\nHeld: Section \u00a71692k(a)(3) is not contrary to, and, thus, does not dis-\n place a district court\u2019s discretion to award costs under, Rule 54(d)(1).\n Pp. 4\u201316.\n    (a) Rule 54(d)(1) gives courts discretion to award costs to prevailing\n parties, but this discretion can be displaced by a federal statute or\n FRCP that \u201cprovides otherwise,\u201d i.e., is \u201ccontrary\u201d to Rule 54(d)(1).\n Contrary to the argument of Marx and the United States, as amicus,\n language of the original 1937 version of the Rule does not suggest\n that any \u201cexpress provision\u201d for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1),\n regardless of whether it is contrary to the Rule. Pp. 4\u20137.\n    (b) Section 1692k(a)(3)\u2019s language and context demonstrate that\n2                 MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    the provision is not contrary to Rule 54(d)(1). Pp. 7\u201315.\n         (1) GRC argues that since \u00a71692k(a)(3) does not address whether\n    costs may be awarded in an FDCPA case brought in good faith, it\n    does not set forth a standard that is contrary to the Rule and there-\n    fore does not displace the presumption that a court has discretion to\n    award costs. Marx and the United States concede that the statute\n    does not expressly limit a court\u2019s discretion to award costs under the\n    Rule, but argue that it does so by negative implication. They claim\n    that unless \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive basis on which to\n    award costs, the phrase \u201cand costs\u201d would be superfluous with Rule\n    54(d)(1). And the United States also argues that \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s more\n    specific cost statute displaces Rule 54(d)(1)\u2019s more general rule.\n    Pp. 7\u20139.\n         (2) The argument of Marx and the United States depends criti-\n    cally on whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s allowance of costs creates a negative\n    implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances.\n    The expressio unius canon that they invoke does not apply \u201cunless it\n    is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility\n    and meant to say no to it,\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U. S.\n    149, 168, and can be overcome by \u201ccontrary indications that adopting\n    a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any ex-\n    clusion,\u201d United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65. Here, context indi-\n    cates that Congress did not intend \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts\n    from awarding costs under the Rule. First, under the American Rule,\n    each litigant generally pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, but the Court\n    has long recognized that federal courts have inherent power to award\n    attorney\u2019s fees in a narrow set of circumstances, e.g., when a party\n    brings an action in bad faith. The statute is thus best read as codify-\n    ing a court\u2019s pre-existing authority to award both attorney\u2019s fees and\n    costs. Next, \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s second sentence must be understood in\n    light of its first, which provides an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs,\n    but to prevailing plaintiffs. By adding \u201cand costs\u201d to the second sen-\n    tence, Congress foreclosed the argument that defendants can only re-\n    cover attorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith and\n    removed any doubt that defendants may recover costs as well as at-\n    torney\u2019s fees in such cases. Finally, \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s language sharply\n    contrasts with that of other statutes in which Congress has placed\n    conditions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g., 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a71928. Pp. 9\u201312.\n         (3) Even assuming that their surplusage argument is correct, the\n    canon against surplusage is not absolute. First, the canon \u201cassists\n    only where a competing interpretation gives effect to every clause\n    and word of a statute.\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. Here, no interpretation of \u00a71692k(a)(3) gives effect to\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  every word. Second, redundancy is not unusual in statutes address-\n  ing costs. See, e.g., 12 U. S. C. \u00a72607(d)(5). Finally, the canon is\n  strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another\n  part of the same statutory scheme. Because \u00a71692k(a)(3) is not part\n  of Rule 54(d)(1), the force of this canon is diminished. Pp. 13\u201314.\n       (4) Lastly, contrary to the United States\u2019 claim that specific cost-\n  shifting standards displace general ones, the context of the statute\n  indicates that Congress was simply confirming the background pre-\n  sumption that courts may award to defendants attorney\u2019s fees and\n  costs when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith. Because Marx\n  did not bring this suit in bad faith, the specific provision is not appli-\n  cable.

S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3), provides that \u201c[o]n a finding by\nthe court that an action under this section was brought\nin bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court\nmay award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees reasonable in\nrelation to the work expended and costs.\u201d This case pre-\nsents the question whether \u00a71692k(a)(3) \u201cprovides other-\nwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1). We conclude that \u00a71692k(a)(3)\ndoes not \u201cprovid[e] otherwise,\u201d and thus a district court\nmay award costs to prevailing defendants in FDCPA cases\nwithout finding that the plaintiff brought the case in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\n                          I\n  Petitioner Olivea Marx defaulted on a student loan\nguaranteed by EdFund, a division of the California Stu-\ndent Aid Commission. In September 2008, EdFund hired\nrespondent General Revenue Corporation (GRC) to collect\n2               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debt. One month later, Marx filed an FDCPA en-\nforcement action against GRC.1 Marx alleged that GRC\nhad violated the FDCPA by harassing her with phone calls\nseveral times a day and falsely threatening to garnish up\nto 50% of her wages and to take the money she owed\ndirectly from her bank account. Shortly after the com-\nplaint was filed, GRC made an offer of judgment under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 to pay Marx $1,500,\nplus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, to settle any\nclaims she had against it. Marx did not respond to the\noffer. She subsequently amended her complaint to add\na claim that GRC unlawfully sent a fax to her workplace\nthat requested information about her employment status.\n  Following a 1-day bench trial, the District Court found\nthat Marx had failed to prove any violation of the FDCPA.\nAs the prevailing party, GRC submitted a bill of costs\nseeking $7,779.16 in witness fees, witness travel expenses,\nand deposition transcript fees. The court disallowed sev-\neral items of costs and, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 54(d)(1), ordered Marx to pay GRC $4,543.03.\nMarx filed a motion to vacate the award of costs, arguing\nthat the court lacked authority to award costs under Rules\n54(d)(1) and 68(d) because 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets\nforth the exclusive basis for awarding costs in FDCPA\ncases.2 Section 1692k(a)(3) provides, in relevant part: \u201cOn\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The FDCPA is a consumer protection statute that prohibits certain\n\nabusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a71692. The FDCPA\u2019s private-enforcement provision, \u00a71692k, author-\nizes any aggrieved person to recover damages from \u201cany debt collector\nwho fails to comply with any provision\u201d of the FDCPA. \u00a71692k(a).\n   2 Under Rule 68(d), if a defendant makes a settlement offer, and the\n\nplaintiff rejects it and later obtains a judgment that is less favorable\nthan the one offered her, the plaintiff must pay the costs incurred by\nthe defendant after the offer was made. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(d)\n(\u201cIf the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable\nthan the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after\nthe offer was made\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

The Dis-\ntrict Court rejected Marx\u2019s argument, concluding that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) does not displace a court\u2019s discretion to award\ncosts under Rule 54(d)(1) and that costs should also be\nawarded under Rule 68(d).\n   The Tenth Circuit affirmed but agreed only with part\nof the District Court\u2019s reasoning. In particular, the court\ndisagreed that costs were allowed under Rule 68(d). 668\nF. 3d 1174, 1182 (2011). It explained that \u201cRule 68 applies\nonly where the district court enters judgment in favor of\na plaintiff \u201d for less than the amount of the settlement offer\nand not where the plaintiff loses outright. Ibid. (citing\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 352 (1981)).\nBecause the District Court had not entered judgment in\nfavor of Marx, the court concluded that costs were not\nallowed under Rule 68(d). 668 F. 3d, at 1182. Neverthe-\nless, the court found that costs were allowed under Rule\n54(d)(1), which grants district courts discretion to award\ncosts to prevailing parties unless a federal statute or the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure provide otherwise. Id., at\n1178, 1182. After describing the \u201cvenerable\u201d presumption\nthat prevailing parties are entitled to costs, id., at 1179,\nthe court concluded that nothing in the text, history, or\npurpose of \u00a71692k(a)(3) indicated that it was meant to\ndisplace Rule 54(d)(1), id., at 1178\u20131182. Judge Lucero\ndissented, arguing that \u201c[t]he only sensible reading of\n[\u00a71692k(a)(3)] is that the district court may only award\ncosts to a defendant\u201d upon finding that the action was\nbrought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment\nand that to read it otherwise rendered the phrase \u201cand\n4               MARX v.

S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nconflict among the Circuits regarding whether a prevailing\ndefendant in an FDCPA case may be awarded costs where\nthe lawsuit was not brought in bad faith and for the pur-\npose of harassment. Compare 668 F. 3d, at 1182 (case\nbelow), with Rouse v. Law Offices of Rory Clark, 603 F. 3d\n699, 701 (CA9 2010). We now affirm the judgment of the\nTenth Circuit.\n                             II\n   As in all statutory construction cases, we \u201c \u2018assum[e]\nthat the ordinary meaning of [the statutory] language\naccurately expresses the legislative purpose.\u2019 \u201d Hardt v.

In\nthis case, we must construe both Rule 54(d)(1) and\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) and assess the relationship between them.\n                              A\n  Rule 54(d)(1) is straightforward. It provides, in relevant\npart: \u201cUnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court or-\nder provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than attorney\u2019s fees\u2014\nshould be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d\n  As the Tenth Circuit correctly recognized, Rule 54(d)(1)\ncodifies a venerable presumption that prevailing parties\nare entitled to costs.3 Notwithstanding this presumption,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Prior to the adoption of the federal rules, prevailing parties were\n\nentitled to costs as of right in actions at law while courts had discretion\nto award costs in equity proceedings.

See Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan,\nLtd., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4) (\u201cFederal\nRule of Civil Procedure 54(d) gives courts the discretion\nto award costs to prevailing parties\u201d). Rule 54(d)(1) also\nmakes clear, however, that this discretion can be displaced\nby a federal statute or a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\nthat \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d\n   A statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1) if it is\n\u201ccontrary\u201d to the Rule. See 10 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal\nPractice \u00a754.101[1][c], p. 54\u2013159 (3d ed. 2012) (hereinafter\n10 Moore\u2019s). Because the Rule grants district courts dis-\ncretion to award costs, a statute is contrary to the Rule if\nit limits that discretion. A statute may limit a court\u2019s dis-\ncretion in several ways, and it need not expressly state\nthat it is displacing Rule 54(d)(1) to do so. For instance,\na statute providing that \u201cplaintiffs shall not be liable for\ncosts\u201d is contrary to Rule 54(d)(1) because it precludes a\ncourt from awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See,\ne.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a718(d)(1) (\u201cThe petitioner shall not be liable\nfor costs in the district court\u201d). Similarly, a statute provid-\ning that plaintiffs may recover costs only under certain\nconditions is contrary to Rule 54(d) because it precludes a\ncourt from awarding costs to prevailing plaintiffs when\nthose conditions have not been satisfied. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71928 (\u201c[N]o costs shall be included in such judg-\nment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office\u201d).\n   Importantly, not all statutes that provide for costs are\ncontrary to Rule 54(d)(1).

App., p. 734 (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nAccordingly, the United States asserts that any \u201cexpress\nprovision\u201d for costs should displace Rule 54(d)(1).\n   We are not persuaded, however, that the original ver-\nsion of Rule 54(d) should be interpreted as Marx and the\nUnited States suggest. The original language was meant\nto ensure that Rule 54(d) did not displace existing costs\nprovisions that were contrary to the Rule. Under the prior\nlanguage, statutes that simply permitted a court to award\ncosts did not displace the Rule. See 6 J. Moore, Moore\u2019s\nFederal Practice \u00a754.71[1], p. 54\u2013304 (2d ed. 1996)\n(\u201c[W]hen permissive language is used [in a statute regard-\ning costs] the district court may, pursuant to Rule 54(d),\nexercise a sound discretion relative to the allowance of\ncosts\u201d). Rather, statutes had to set forth a standard for\nawarding costs that was different from Rule 54(d)(1) in\norder to displace the Rule. See Friedman v. Ganassi, 853\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nF. 2d 207, 210 (CA3 1988) (holding that 15 U. S. C. \u00a777k(e)\nis not an \u201cexpress provision\u201d under Rule 54(d) because it\ndoes not provide an \u201calternative standard\u201d for awarding\ntaxable costs). The original version of Rule 54(d) is con-\nsistent with our conclusion that a statute must be contrary\nto Rule 54(d)(1) in order to displace it.4\n                            B\n  We now turn to whether \u00a71692k(a)(3) is contrary to Rule\n54(d)(1). The language of \u00a71692k(a)(3) and the context\nsurrounding it persuade us that it is not.\n                             1\n   The second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) provides: \u201cOn a\nfinding by the court that an action under this section was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  dissent provides no stable definition of \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d\nFirst, it argues that a statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d if it is \u201cdifferent\u201d\nfrom Rule 54(d)(1). Post, at 2 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.). That inter-\npretation renders the Rule meaningless because every statute is \u201cdif-\nferent\u201d insofar as it is not an exact copy of the Rule. Next, it argues\nthat a statute \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d if it is an \u201c \u2018express provision\u2019\nrelating to costs.\u201d Post, at 2\u20133. Under that view, a statute providing\nthat \u201cthe court may award costs to the prevailing party\u201d would \u201cprovide\notherwise.\u201d We do not think such a statute provides otherwise\u2014it\nprovides \u201csame-wise,\u201d and the treatise on which the dissent relies\nsupports our view. See 10 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal\nPractice and Procedure \u00a72670, p. 258 (3d ed. 1998 and Supp. 2012)\n(\u201c[Statutes that] are permissive in character . . . are not inconsistent\nwith the discretion given the district court by Rule 54(d)\u201d). Finally,\nthe dissent seems to implicitly accept that \u201cotherwise\u201d means \u201cto the\ncontrary\u201d in the course of arguing that a doctor\u2019s instruction to take\nmedication \u201c \u2018in the morning\u2019 \u201d would supersede an instruction on the\nmedication label to \u201c \u2018take [it] twice a day unless otherwise directed,\u2019 \u201d\nbecause the patient would understand the doctor\u2019s advice to mean that\nhe should take the medicine \u201conce a day, each morning.\u201d Post, at 4. If\nthe patient understands the doctor to mean \u201conce a day, each morning,\u201d\nwe agree that such advice would \u201cprovide otherwise,\u201d because the\ndoctor\u2019s order would be \u201ccontrary\u201d to the label\u2019s instruction. For the\nreasons set forth in Part II\u2013B, however, we are not convinced that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) is \u201ccontrary\u201d to Rule 54(d)(1).\n8               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment,\nthe court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees\nreasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d5\n  GRC contends that the statute does not address whether\ncosts may be awarded in this case\u2014where the plaintiff\nbrought the case in good faith\u2014and thus it does not set\nforth a standard for awarding costs that is contrary to\nRule 54(d)(1). In its view, Congress intended \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nto deter plaintiffs from bringing nuisance lawsuits. It,\ntherefore, expressly provided that when plaintiffs bring an\naction in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the\ncourt may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the defend-\nant. The statute does address this type of case\u2014i.e., cases\nin which the plaintiff brings the action in bad faith and\nfor the purpose of harassment. But it is silent where bad\nfaith and purpose of harassment are absent, and silence\ndoes not displace the background rule that a court has\ndiscretion to award costs.\n  Marx and the United States take the contrary view.\nThey concede that the language does not expressly limit\na court\u2019s discretion to award costs under Rule 54(d)(1),\nBrief for Petitioner 10; Brief for United States 19, but\nargue that it does so by negative implication. Invoking the\nexpressio unius canon of statutory construction, they\ncontend that by specifying that a court may award attor-\nney\u2019s fees and costs when an action is brought in bad faith\nand for the purpose of harassment, Congress intended to\npreclude a court from awarding fees and costs when bad\nfaith and purpose of harassment are absent. They further\nargue that unless \u00a71692k(a)(3) sets forth the exclusive\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 It is undisputed that GRC is not entitled to costs under \u00a71692k(a)(3)\n\nbecause the District Court did not find that Marx brought this action in\nbad faith. But Rule 54(d)(1) independently authorizes district courts to\naward costs to prevailing parties. The question in this case is not\nwhether costs are allowed under \u00a71692k(a)(3) but whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nprecludes an award of costs under Rule 54(d)(1).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbasis on which a court may award costs, the phrase \u201cand\ncosts\u201d would be superfluous. According to this argument,\nCongress would have had no reason to specify that a court\nmay award costs when a plaintiff brings an action in\nbad faith if it could have nevertheless awarded costs under\nRule 54(d)(1). Finally, the United States argues that\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) is a more specific cost statute that displaces\nRule 54(d)(1)\u2019s more general rule.\n  The context surrounding \u00a71692k(a)(3) persuades us that\nGRC\u2019s interpretation is correct.\n                              2\n   The argument of Marx and the United States depends\ncritically on whether \u00a71692k(a)(3)\u2019s allowance of costs\ncreates a negative implication that costs are unavailable\nin any other circumstances. The force of any negative\nimplication, however, depends on context. We have long\nheld that the expressio unius canon does not apply \u201cunless\nit is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed\npossibility and meant to say no to it,\u201d Barnhart v. Peabody\nCoal Co., 537 U. S. 149, 168 (2003), and that the canon\ncan be overcome by \u201ccontrary indications that adopting a\nparticular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal\nany exclusion,\u201d United States v. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65\n(2002). In this case, context persuades us that Congress\ndid not intend \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from award-\ning costs under Rule 54(d)(1).\n   First, the background presumptions governing attorney\u2019s\nfees and costs are a highly relevant contextual feature.\nAs already explained, under Rule 54(d)(1) a prevailing\nparty is entitled to recover costs from the losing party\nunless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure, or a court order \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d The opposite\npresumption exists with respect to attorney\u2019s fees. Under\nthe \u201cbedrock principle known as the \u2018 \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c[e]ach litigant pays his own attorney\u2019s fees, win or lose,\n10             MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nunless a statute or contract provides otherwise.\u201d Hardt,\n560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Ruckelshaus v.\nSierra Club, 463 U. S. 680, 683 (1983)). Notwithstanding\nthe American Rule, however, we have long recognized that\nfederal courts have inherent power to award attorney\u2019s\nfees in a narrow set of circumstances, including when a\nparty brings an action in bad faith. See Chambers v.\nNASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 45\u201346 (1991) (explaining that\na court has inherent power to award attorney\u2019s fees to a\nparty whose litigation efforts directly benefit others, to\nsanction the willful disobedience of a court order, and to\nsanction a party who has acted in bad faith, vexatiously,\nwantonly, or for oppressive reasons); Alyeska Pipeline\nService Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 257\u2013259\n(1975) (same).\n  It is undisputed that \u00a71692k(a)(3) leaves the back-\nground rules for attorney\u2019s fees intact. The statute pro-\nvides that when the plaintiff brings an action in bad\nfaith, the court may award attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant.\nBut, as noted, a court has inherent power to award fees\nbased on a litigant\u2019s bad faith even without \u00a71692k(a)(3).\nSee Chambers, supra, at 45\u201346. Because \u00a71692k(a)(3)\ncodifies the background rule for attorney\u2019s fees, it is dubi-\nous to infer congressional intent to override the back-\nground rule with respect to costs. The statute is best read\nas codifying a court\u2019s pre-existing authority to award both\nattorney\u2019s fees and costs.6\n  Next, the second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) must be un-\nderstood in light of the sentence that precedes it.7 The\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Indeed, had Congress intended \u00a71692k(a)(3) to foreclose a court\u2019s\n\ndiscretion to award costs, it could not have chosen a more circuitous\nway to do so. The statute sets forth the circumstances in which a court\n\u201cmay\u201d award costs. But under Marx\u2019s and the United States\u2019 view, the\nonly consequence of the statute is to set forth the circumstances in\nwhich it may not award costs.\n  7 Section 1692k(a) provides:\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nfirst sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) provides that defendants\nwho violate the FDCPA are liable for the plaintiff \u2019s attor-\nney\u2019s fees and costs. The second sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nsimilarly provides that plaintiffs who bring an action in\nbad faith and for the purpose of harassment may be liable\nfor the defendant\u2019s fees and costs.\n   If Congress had excluded \u201cand costs\u201d in the second sen-\ntence, plaintiffs might have argued that the expression of\ncosts in the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in\nthe second meant that defendants could only recover\nattorney\u2019s fees when plaintiffs bring an action in bad faith.\nBy adding \u201cand costs\u201d to the second sentence, Congress\nforeclosed that argument, thereby removing any doubt\nthat defendants may recover costs as well as attorney\u2019s\nfees when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith. See Ali v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 226 (2008) (ex-\nplaining that a phrase is not superfluous if used to \u201cre-\nmove . . . doubt\u201d about an issue); Fort Stewart Schools v.\nFLRA, 495 U.

On a finding by the court that an action\nunder this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of\nharassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney\u2019s fees\nreasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.\u201d\n12             MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nof an abundance of caution\u201d). The fact that there might\nhave been a negative implication that costs are precluded,\ndepending on whether Congress included or excluded the\nphrase \u201cand costs,\u201d weighs against giving effect to any\nimplied limitation.\n   Finally, the language in \u00a71692k(a)(3) sharply contrasts\nwith other statutes in which Congress has placed condi-\ntions on awarding costs to prevailing defendants. See, e.g.,\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71928 (\u201c[N]o costs shall be included in such\njudgment, unless the proper disclaimer has been filed in\nthe United States Patent and Trademark Office prior to\nthe commencement of the action\u201d (emphasis added)); 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71988(b) (\u201c[I]n any action brought against a judi-\ncial officer . . . such officer shall not be held liable for any\ncosts . . . unless such action was clearly in excess of such\nofficer\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Although Congress need not use explicit language to\nlimit a court\u2019s discretion under Rule 54(d)(1), its use of\nexplicit language in other statutes cautions against infer-\nring a limitation in \u00a71692k(a)(3). These statutes confirm\nthat Congress knows how to limit a court\u2019s discretion\nunder Rule 54(d)(1) when it so desires. See Small v. United\nStates, 544 U. S. 385, 398 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning) (explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019 explicit use of [language]\nin other provisions shows that it specifies such restrictions\nwhen it wants to do so\u201d). Had Congress intended the\nsecond sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) to displace Rule 54(d)(1),\nit could have easily done so by using the word \u201conly\u201d be-\nfore setting forth the condition \u201c[o]n a finding by the court\nthat an action . . . was brought in bad faith and for the\npurpose of harassment . . . .\u201d8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 Marx also suggests that \u00a71692k(a)(3) is similar to the Pipeline\n\nSafety Act, 49 U. S. C. \u00a760121(b), which provides: \u201cThe court may award\ncosts to a prevailing defendant when the action is unreasonable, frivo-\nlous, or meritless.\u201d We have never had occasion to interpret \u00a760121(b)\nand its interaction with Rule 54(d)(1).\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                                3\n    As the above discussion suggests, we also are not per-\nsuaded by Marx\u2019s objection that our interpretation renders\nthe phrase \u201cand costs\u201d superfluous. As noted, supra, at 11,\nthe phrase \u201cand costs\u201d would not be superfluous if Con-\ngress included it to remove doubt that defendants may\nrecover costs when plaintiffs bring suits in bad faith. But\neven assuming that our interpretation renders the phrase\n\u201cand costs\u201d superfluous, that would not alter our conclu-\nsion. The canon against surplusage is not an absolute\nrule, see Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Mur-\nphy, 548 U. S. 291, 299, n. 1 (2006) (\u201cWhile it is generally\npresumed that statutes do not contain surplusage, in-\nstances of surplusage are not unknown\u201d); Connecticut Nat.\nBank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992) (\u201cRedundan-\ncies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting\n. . . \u201d), and it has considerably less force in this case.\n    First, the canon against surplusage \u201cassists only where\na competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and\nword of a statute.\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership,\n564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But, in this case, no interpretation of\n\u00a71692k(a)(3) gives effect to every word. Both Marx and\nthe United States admit that a court has inherent power\nto award attorney\u2019s fees to a defendant when the plaintiff\nbrings an action in bad faith. Because there was, conse-\nquently, no need for Congress to specify that courts have\nthis power, \u00a71692k(a)(3) is superfluous insofar as it ad-\ndresses attorney\u2019s fees. In light of this redundancy, we are\nnot overly concerned that the reference to costs may be\nredundant as well.\n    Second, redundancy is \u201chardly unusual\u201d in statutes\naddressing costs. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 13). Numer-\nous statutes overlap with Rule 54(d)(1). See, e.g., 12\nU. S. C. \u00a72607(d)(5) (\u201c[T]he court may award to the pre-\nvailing party the court costs of the action\u201d); \u00a75565(b) (2006\n14           MARX v.

Marx and the United\nStates contend that Congress intended to limit a court\u2019s discretion to\naward costs to prevailing defendants because FDCPA plaintiffs are\noften poor and may be deterred from challenging unlawful debt collec-\ntion practices by the possibility of being held liable for the defendant\u2019s\ncosts. This purposive argument cannot overcome the language and\ncontext of \u00a71692k(a)(3), but even if it could, we find it unpersuasive.\nRule 54(d)(1) does not require courts to award costs to prevailing\ndefendants. District courts may appropriately consider an FDCPA\nplaintiff\u2019s indigency in deciding whether to award costs.

This default, how-\never, gives way when a federal statute includes a costs\nprovision that \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d The Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act (FDCPA), 91 Stat. 874, 15 U. S. C. \u00a71692\net seq., contains a costs provision, \u00a71692k(a)(3), and it\n\u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d That is apparent from the statute\u2019s\nplain language, which limits a court\u2019s discretion to award\ncosts to prevailing defendants to cases \u201cbrought in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\u201d In reaching the\nopposite conclusion, the Court ignores the plain meaning\nof both the FDCPA and Rule 54(d)(1) and renders the\nstatutory language at issue in this case meaningless.

S., at\n241 (internal quotation marks omitted). This basic tenet\nis the appropriate starting point for interpreting both Rule\n54(d)(1) and \u00a71692k(a)(3). After invoking this principle,\nhowever, the majority casts it aside entirely in interpret-\ning the statute and the Rule.\n                               A\n   Rule 54(d)(1) states, as relevant here, that \u201c[u]nless a\nfederal statute . . . provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than\nattorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing\nparty.\u201d The first question is what it means for a statute\nto \u201cprovid[e] otherwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1).\n   Because the phrase \u201cprovides otherwise\u201d is not defined\nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we look to its\nordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513\nU. S. 179, 187 (1995). In common usage, to \u201cprovide oth-\nerwise\u201d means to \u201cmake a . . . stipulation\u201d that is \u201cdiffer-\nen[t].\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n1598, 1827 (2002) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defining \u201cprovide\u201d\nand \u201cotherwise,\u201d respectively); see Random House Diction-\nary of the English Language 1372, 1556 (2d ed. 1987)\n(Random House) (\u201cto arrange for or stipulate\u201d \u201c[i]n another\nmanner\u201d); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1989)\n(Oxford Dictionary); 12 id., at 713 (\u201cto stipulate\u201d \u201c[i]n\nanother way . . . ; in a different manner\u201d).

If Congress has enacted a provision with\nrespect to costs in a statute, there is no longer any need\nfor the default, so it gives way. This design of the Rule is\nsensible, because many statutes contain specific costs\nprovisions. 10 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a754.101[1][c], p.\n54\u2013160 (3d ed. 2012) (noting that such statutes \u201care far\ntoo numerous to list comprehensively\u201d). Rule 54(d)(1) is\ntherefore consistent with the canon of statutory interpre-\ntation that \u201ca precisely drawn, detailed statute pre-empts\nmore general remedies.\u201d Hinck v. United States, 550 U. S.\n501, 506 (2007); Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons,\nInc., 482 U. S. 437, 445 (1987); United States v. Erika,\nInc., 456 U.

In \u00a71692k(a)(3), Con-\ngress described with specificity a single circumstance in\nwhich costs may be awarded. Far from merely restating a\ndistrict court\u2019s discretion to award costs, this provision\nimposes a prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion: a\nfinding by the court that an action was brought in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment.\n   Because the text is plain, there is no need to proceed\nany further. Even so, relevant canons of statutory inter-\npretation lend added support to reading \u00a71692k(a)(3) as\nhaving a negative implication. That reading accords with\nthe expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon, which in-\nstructs that when Congress includes one possibility in a\nstatute, it excludes another by implication. See Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U. S. 73, 80\u201381 (2002).\nThis rule reinforces what the text makes clear. By limit-\ning a court\u2019s discretion to award costs to cases brought in\nbad faith or for the purpose of harassment, Congress\n6               MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nforeclosed the award of costs in other circumstances.4\n   Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute is also strongly\nfavored by the rule that statutes should be read to avoid\nsuperfluity. Under this \u201cmost basic of interpretative\ncanons, . . . \u2018 \u201c[a] statute should be constructed so that\neffect is given to all of its provisions, so that no part will be\ninoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Corley\nv. United States, 556 U. S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs\nv. Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101 (2004)). Respondent\u2019s reading,\nas it mostly acknowledges, renders the entire sentence\nmeaningless because it reiterates powers that federal\ncourts already possess with respect to both costs and\nattorney\u2019s fees. See Brief for Respondent 22\u201324.\n   The majority rejects this argument, citing the rule that\nthis canon \u201c \u2018assists only where a competing interpretation\ngives effect to every clause and word of a statute.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\nat 13 (quoting Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12)). In its view, neither\nof the available interpretations can eliminate superfluity\nbecause the attorney\u2019s fees provision is redundant under\nany reading. Ante, at 13. But the canon against super-\nfluity surely counsels against an interpretation that renders\nthe entire provision at issue superfluous when a compet-\ning interpretation would at least render part of the provi-\nsion meaningful. Nor does the majority\u2019s observation that\nredundancy is \u201c \u2018hardly unusual,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 14, in provi-\nsions relating to costs make the canon inapplicable. While\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The majority suggests that this canon does not apply to \u00a71692k(a)(3)\n\nbecause it only aids where \u201c \u2018it is fair to suppose that Congress consid-\nered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9\n(quoting Barnhart v.

S. 83, 98 (1991). And here, the plain language of \u00a71692k(a)(3)\nmakes it clear that Congress meant to foreclose other possible mean-\nings.

In Cooper Industries, Inc.\nv. Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 157, 166 (2004) (opinion\nfor the Court by THOMAS, J.), we considered a provision in\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensa-\ntion, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S. C. \u00a79613(f)(1) that\nprovided: \u201c[a]ny person may seek contribution . . . during\n. . . any civil action under section 9606 of this title\u201d (em-\nphasis added). We rejected the argument that the word\n\u201cmay\u201d indicated that \u201cduring a civil action\u201d was one but\nnot the exclusive circumstance in which the right of con-\ntribution was available. 543 U. S., at 166. We instead\nadopted the natural reading of the text, holding that a\nparty\u2019s ability to seek contribution was limited by the\nphrase \u201cduring any civil action\u201d and that contribution was\nonly available while a lawsuit is pending. Ibid. The same\nlogic applies here, because \u00a71692k(a)(3) imposes a closely\nanalogous condition on a court\u2019s discretion to award costs.\n                           2\n   The first sentence of \u00a71692k(a)(3) underscores that\nCongress implemented a different rule than Rule 54(d)(1).\nThat sentence provides that a debt collector who violates\nthe FDCPA is \u201cliable to\u201d a prevailing plaintiff for \u201cthe\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 See, e.g., 15 U.

Cf. Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.,\n566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4). Because Congress\ndeviated from Rule 54(d)(1) in the first sentence of\n\u00a71692k(a)(3), the most reasonable reading is that the\nsentence that immediately follows, which states the rule\nfor prevailing defendants, takes a similar path.\n   The majority believes that its reading of the costs provi-\nsion follows from the first sentence as well, but for a dif-\nferent reason. Ante, at 11\u201312. It suggests that if Congress\nhad not included costs in the second sentence, a plaintiff\nmight have been able to argue that the inclusion of costs\nin the first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the\nsecond indicated that defendants could recover only fees\nwhen an action is brought in bad faith. The majority then\nspeculates that Congress included costs in the second\nsentence to foreclose that argument.\n   The text of the previous sentence makes plain, however,\nthat the second sentence departs from the Rule 54(d)(1)\ndefault, and the majority offers no evidence in support of\nits supposition that Congress intended a different mean-\ning.6 Moreover, I see no basis for invoking potential con-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    6 The majority does not explain why its speculation about legislative\n\nintent is more persuasive than the Solicitor General\u2019s view that sad-\ndling potential plaintiffs with costs would undermine the FDCPA\u2019s\n\u201c \u2018calibrated scheme\u2019 \u201d of enforcement.

See ante, at 4. Even if it were appropriate to\nconsider a background presumption rather than reading\nthe plain text at issue, the majority\u2019s characterization of\nthe presumption is at best incomplete.\n   First, the Court\u2019s suggestion that the presumption\nregarding costs is a \u201cvenerable\u201d one in American law is an\noverstatement. Ibid. It is true, as the majority points out,\nthat prior to the federal rules, \u201cprevailing parties were\nentitled to costs as of right in actions at law while courts\nhad discretion to award costs in equity proceedings.\u201d Ante,\nat 4, n. 3; see Wright & Miller \u00a72665, at 199. But the\ndoctrine governing costs at law carved out an important\nexception for statutory provisions that set forth a differ-\nent rule.7 Where there was such a statute, courts would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See Ex parte Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 318 (1920) (\u201c[I]n actions at law\n\nthe prevailing party is entitled to costs as of right . . . , except in those\nfew cases where by express statutory provision or established principles\ncosts are denied\u201d (emphasis added)); see also United States v. Tread-\nwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 534 (SDNY 1883) (\u201c[T]he prevailing party shall be\nentitled to costs in all cases, unless otherwise expressly provided by law\u201d\n10             MARX v. GENERAL REVENUE CORP.\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsimply apply it. In its assessment of the background princi-\nples underlying its approach, the majority glosses over the\nlongstanding expectation that Congress often enacts dif-\nferent rules with respect to costs, and when it does, these\nrules govern.\n   Second, Rule 54(d)(1) embraces this long-recognized\nexception because it specifies that a statute can displace\nits default rule. To repeat, Rule 54(d)(1) merely enacts a\ndefault standard that applies unless, among other things,\na statute or rule \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d Here, for the rea-\nsons explained, Congress enacted exactly such a statute.\nThat is clear from the text, because \u00a71692k(a)(3) condi-\ntions the award of costs on the satisfaction of a condition,\nand because the previous sentence of the same provision\nbreaks from the default.\n                        *    *     *\n  The plain text of Rule 54(d)(1) and \u00a71692k(a)(3) dictates\nthe result in this case. Accordingly, I would reverse the\nTenth Circuit and hold that \u00a71692k(a)(3) \u201cprovides other-\nwise\u201d than Rule 54(d)(1), such that a district court cannot\naward costs to a prevailing defendant in an FDCPA action\nexcept upon a showing that the action was brought in bad\nfaith and for the purpose of harassment. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n(emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted)); Payne, Costs in\nCommon Law Actions in the Federal Courts, 21 Va. L. Rev. 397, 430\n(1934) (\u201cBy reason of the numerous changes in the acts of Congress\nrespecting costs, many of the older cases are not now safe precedents.\nCare should be exercised, therefore, to make an intelligent use of the\ncases decided prior to the enactment of various statutes\u201d).\n</pre>",
