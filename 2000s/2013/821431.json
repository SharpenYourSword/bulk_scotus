SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE \n\n                    COMMISSION \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11–1274. Argued January 8, 2013—Decided February 27, 2013\nThe Investment Advisers Act makes it illegal for investment advisers to\n  defraud their clients, 15 U. S. C. §§80b–6(1), (2), and authorizes the\n  Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions\n  against investment advisers who violate the Act, or against individu-\n  als who aid and abet such violations, §80b–9(d). If the SEC seeks civ-\n  il penalties as part of those actions, it must file suit “within five years\n  from the date when the claim first accrued,” pursuant to a general\n  statute of limitations that governs many penalty provisions through-\n  out the U. S. Code, 28 U. S. C. §2462.\n     In 2008, the SEC sought civil penalties from petitioners Alpert and\n  Gabelli. The complaint alleged that they aided and abetted invest-\n  ment adviser fraud from 1999 until 2002. Petitioners moved to dis-\n  miss, arguing in part that the civil penalty claim was untimely. In-\n  voking the five-year statute of limitations in §2462, they pointed out\n  that the complaint alleged illegal activity up until August 2002 but\n  was not filed until April 2008. The District Court agreed and dis-\n  missed the civil penalty claim as time barred. The Second Circuit re-\n  versed, accepting the SEC’s argument that because the underlying\n  violations sounded in fraud, the “discovery rule” applied, meaning\n  that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the SEC dis-\n  covered or reasonably could have discovered the fraud.\nHeld: The five-year clock in §2462 begins to tick when the fraud occurs,\n not when it is discovered. Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) This is the most natural reading of the statute. “In common\n parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence.” United States\n v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569. The “standard rule” is that a claim\n accrues “when the plaintiff has ‘ “a complete and present cause of ac-\n2                            GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion.” ’ ” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 388. Such an understanding\n    appears in cases and dictionaries from the 19th century, when the\n    predecessor to §2462 was enacted. And this reading sets a fixed date\n    when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts ends,\n    advancing “the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,\n    elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff’s oppor-\n    tunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella v.\n    Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Government nonetheless argues that the discovery rule\n    should apply here. That doctrine is an “exception” to the standard\n    rule, and delays accrual “until a plaintiff has ‘discovered’ ” his cause\n    of action. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. It arose from\n    the recognition that “something different was needed in the case of\n    fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff\n    from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. Thus\n    “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and ‘remains in igno-\n    rance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,\n    the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discov-\n    ered.’ ” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397. This Court, how-\n    ever, has never applied the discovery rule in this context, where the\n    plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is instead\n    the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.\n    The Government’s case is not saved by Exploration Co. v. United\n    States, 247 U. S. 435. There, the discovery rule was applied in favor\n    of the Government, but the Government was itself a victim; it had\n    been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss. It was not bringing\n    an enforcement action for penalties.\n       There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been\n    extended to Government civil penalty enforcement actions. The dis-\n    covery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have\n    no reason to suspect fraud. The Government is a different kind of\n    plaintiff. The SEC’s very purpose, for example, is to root out fraud,\n    and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit. The Gov-\n    ernment in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.\n    The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recom-\n    pense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation, are intended to\n    punish, and label defendants wrongdoers. Emphasizing the im-\n    portance of time limits on penalty actions, Chief Justice Marshall\n    admonished that it “would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our\n    laws” if actions for penalties could “be brought at any distance of\n    time.” Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342. Yet grafting the discov-\n    ery rule onto §2462 would raise similar concerns. It would leave de-\n    fendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five\n    years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

And repose would hinge on speculation about what the\n  Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known\n  it. Deciding when the Government knew or reasonably should have\n  known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the\n  courts, such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing\n  Government knowledge, whether and how to consider agency priori-\n  ties and resource constraints in deciding when the Government rea-\n  sonably should have known of a fraud, and so on. Applying a discov-\n  ery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than\n  applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and the Court de-\n  clines to do so.

Under the general\nstatute of limitations for civil penalty actions, the SEC has\nfive years to seek such penalties. The question is whether\nthe five-year clock begins to tick when the fraud is com-\nplete or when the fraud is discovered.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, it is unlaw-\nful for an investment adviser “to employ any device,\nscheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective\nclient” or “to engage in any transaction, practice, or course\nof business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any\nclient or prospective client.” 54 Stat. 852, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §§80b–6(1), (2). The Securities and Exchange\nCommission is authorized to bring enforcement actions\n2                      GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst investment advisers who violate the Act, or indi-\nviduals who aid and abet such violations. §80b–9(d).\n  As part of such enforcement actions, the SEC may seek\ncivil penalties, §§80b–9(e), (f) (2006 ed. and Supp. V), in\nwhich case a five-year statute of limitations applies:\n    “Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an\n    action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any\n    civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or other-\n    wise, shall not be entertained unless commenced\n    within five years from the date when the claim first ac-\n    crued if, within the same period, the offender or the\n    property is found within the United States in order\n    that proper service may be made thereon.” 28 U. S. C.\n    §2462.\nThis statute of limitations is not specific to the Investment\nAdvisers Act, or even to securities law; it governs many\npenalty provisions throughout the U. S. Code. Its origins\ndate back to at least 1839, and it took on its current form\nin 1948. See Act of Feb. 28, 1839, ch. 36, §4, 5 Stat. 322.\n                             B\n  Gabelli Funds, LLC, is an investment adviser to a mu-\ntual fund formerly known as Gabelli Global Growth Fund\n(GGGF). Petitioner Bruce Alpert is Gabelli Funds’ chief\noperating officer, and petitioner Marc Gabelli used to be\nGGGF’s portfolio manager.\n  In 2008, the SEC brought a civil enforcement action\nagainst Alpert and Gabelli. According to the complaint,\nfrom 1999 until 2002 Alpert and Gabelli allowed one\nGGGF investor—Headstart Advisers, Ltd.—to engage in\n“market timing” in the fund.\n  As this Court has explained, “[m]arket timing is a trad-\ning strategy that exploits time delay in mutual funds’\ndaily valuation system.” Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.\nFirst Derivative Traders, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2011)\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(slip op., at 2, n. 1). Mutual funds are typically valued\nonce a day, at the close of the New York Stock Exchange.\nBecause funds often hold securities traded on different\nexchanges around the world, their reported valuation may\nbe based on stale information. If a mutual fund’s reported\nvaluation is artificially low compared to its real value,\nmarket timers will buy that day and sell the next to real-\nize quick profits. Market timing is not illegal but can\nharm long-term investors in a fund. See id., at ___–___,\nand n. 1 (slip op., at 2–3, and n. 1).\n   The SEC’s complaint alleged that Alpert and Gabelli\npermitted Headstart to engage in market timing in ex-\nchange for Headstart’s investment in a hedge fund run by\nGabelli. According to the SEC, petitioners did not disclose\nHeadstart’s market timing or the quid pro quo agreement,\nand instead banned others from engaging in market\ntiming and made statements indicating that the practice\nwould not be tolerated. The complaint stated that during\nthe relevant period, Headstart earned rates of return of up\nto 185%, while “the rate of return for long-term investors\nin GGGF was no more than negative 24.1 percent.” App.\n73.\n   The SEC alleged that Alpert and Gabelli aided and\nabetted violations of §§80b–6(1) and (2), and it sought civil\npenalties under §80b–9. Petitioners moved to dismiss,\narguing in part that the claim for civil penalties was un-\ntimely. They invoked the five-year statute of limitations\nin §2462, pointing out that the complaint alleged market\ntiming up until August 2002 but was not filed until April\n2008. The District Court agreed and dismissed the SEC’s\ncivil penalty claim as time barred.1\n   The Second Circuit reversed. It acknowledged that\n——————\n  1 The SEC also sought injunctive relief and disgorgement, claims the\n\nDistrict Court found timely on the ground that they were not subject to\n§2462. Those issues are not before us.\n4                         GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§2462 required an action for civil penalties to be brought\nwithin five years “from the date when the claim first\naccrued,” but accepted the SEC’s argument that because\nthe underlying violations sounded in fraud, the “discovery\nrule” applied to the statute of limitations. As explained by\nthe Second Circuit, “[u]nder the discovery rule, the statute\nof limitations for a particular claim does not accrue until\nthat claim is discovered, or could have been discovered\nwith reasonable diligence, by the plaintiff.” 653 F. 3d 49,\n59 (2011). The court concluded that while “this rule does\nnot govern the accrual of most claims,” it does govern the\nclaims at issue here. Ibid. As the court explained, “for\nclaims that sound in fraud a discovery rule is read into the\nrelevant statute of limitation.” Id., at 60.2\n  We granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  This case centers around the meaning of 28 U. S. C.\n§2462: “an action . . . for the enforcement of any civil fine,\npenalty, or forfeiture . . . shall not be entertained unless\ncommenced within five years from the date when the\nclaim first accrued.” Petitioners argue that a claim based\non fraud accrues—and the five-year clock begins to tick—\nwhen a defendant’s allegedly fraudulent conduct occurs.\n  That is the most natural reading of the statute. “In\ncommon parlance a right accrues when it comes into exist-\nence . . . .” United States v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569\n——————\n  2 The court distinguished the discovery rule, which governs when a\n\nclaim accrues, from doctrines that toll the running of an applicable\nlimitations period when the defendant takes steps beyond the chal-\nlenged conduct itself to conceal that conduct from the plaintiff. 653\nF. 3d, at 59–60. The SEC abandoned any reliance on such doctrines\nbelow, and they are not before us. See Response and Reply Brief for\nSEC Appellant/Cross-Appellee in No. 10–3581 (CA2), p. 34 (“The\nCommission is not seeking application of the fraudulent concealment\ndoctrine or other equitable tolling principles”).\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Thus the “standard rule” is that a claim accrues\n“when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of\naction.” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 388 (2007) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Bay Area\nLaundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar\nCorp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997); Clark v.

That rule has governed since the\n1830s when the predecessor to §2462 was enacted. See,\ne.g., Bank of United States v.

And that definition\nappears in dictionaries from the 19th century up until\ntoday. See, e.g., 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glos-\nsary 17 (1850) (“an action accrues when the plaintiff has a\nright to commence it”); Black’s Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining “accrue” as “[t]o come into existence as an\nenforceable claim or right”).\n   This reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the\nspecified Government enforcement efforts ends, advancing\n“the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,\nelimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plain-\ntiff ’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential\nliabilities.” Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555 (2000).\nStatutes of limitations are intended to “promote justice by\npreventing surprises through the revival of claims that\nhave been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,\nmemories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.”\nRailroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.,\n321 U. S. 342, 348–349 (1944). They provide “security and\nstability to human affairs.” Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U. S.\n135, 139 (1879). We have deemed them “vital to the\nwelfare of society,” ibid., and concluded that “even wrong-\ndoers are entitled to assume that their sins may be forgot-\nten,” Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 271 (1985).\n                          B\n  Notwithstanding these considerations, the Government\n6                      GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nargues that the discovery rule should apply instead.\nUnder this rule, accrual is delayed “until the plaintiff has\n‘discovered’ ” his cause of action. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8). The doctrine arose\nin 18th-century fraud cases as an “exception” to the stand-\nard rule, based on the recognition that “something differ-\nent was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant’s\ndeceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even know-\ning that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. This Court\nhas held that “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud\nand ‘remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want\nof diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does\nnot begin to run until the fraud is discovered.’ ” Holmberg\nv. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946) (quoting Bailey v.\nGlover, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89018\"><a href=\"/scotus/ssN/bailey-v-glover/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 348 (1875)). And we have explained\nthat “fraud is deemed to be discovered when, in the exer-\ncise of reasonable diligence, it could have been discovered.”\nMerck & Co., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quota-\ntion marks and alterations omitted).\n   But we have never applied the discovery rule in this\ncontext, where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim\nseeking recompense, but is instead the Government bring-\ning an enforcement action for civil penalties. Despite the\ndiscovery rule’s centuries-old roots, the Government cites\nno lower court case before 2008 employing a fraud-based\ndiscovery rule in a Government enforcement action for\ncivil penalties. See Brief for Respondent 23 (citing SEC v.\nTambone, 550 F. 3d 106, 148–149 (CA1 2008); SEC v.\nKoenig, 557 F. 3d 736, 739 (CA7 2009)). When pressed at\noral argument, the Government conceded that it was\naware of no such case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. The Govern-\nment was also unable to point to any example from the\nfirst 160 years after enactment of this statute of limita-\ntions where it had even asserted that the fraud discovery\nrule applied in such a context.

United States, 247 U. S. 435 (1918), in an attempt to\nshow that the discovery rule should benefit the Govern-\nment to the same extent as private parties. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Respondent 10–11, 16, 17, 33–34, 41–45. In that\ncase, a company had fraudulently procured land from the\nUnited States, and the United States sued to undo the trans-\naction. The company raised the statute of limitations as a\ndefense, but this Court allowed the case to proceed, con-\ncluding that the rule “that statutes of limitations upon\nsuits to set aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin\nto run until the discovery of the fraud” applied “in favor of\nthe Government as well as a private individual.” Explora-\ntion Co., supra, at 449. But in Exploration Co., the Gov-\nernment was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and\nwas suing to recover its loss. The Government was not\nbringing an enforcement action for penalties. Exploration\nCo. cannot save the Government’s case here.\n   There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has\nnot been extended to Government enforcement actions for\ncivil penalties. The discovery rule exists in part to pre-\nserve the claims of victims who do not know they are\ninjured and who reasonably do not inquire as to any\ninjury. Usually when a private party is injured, he is imme-\ndiately aware of that injury and put on notice that his time\nto sue is running. But when the injury is self-concealing,\nprivate parties may be unaware that they have been\nharmed. Most of us do not live in a state of constant in-\nvestigation; absent any reason to think we have been\ninjured, we do not typically spend our days looking for\nevidence that we were lied to or defrauded. And the law\ndoes not require that we do so. Instead, courts have de-\nveloped the discovery rule, providing that the statute of\nlimitations in fraud cases should typically begin to run\n8                       GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nonly when the injury is or reasonably could have been\ndiscovered.\n   The same conclusion does not follow for the Government\nin the context of enforcement actions for civil penalties.\nThe SEC, for example, is not like an individual victim who\nrelies on apparent injury to learn of a wrong. Rather, a\ncentral “mission” of the Commission is to “investigat[e]\npotential violations of the federal securities laws.” SEC,\nEnforcement Manual 1 (2012). Unlike the private party\nwho has no reason to suspect fraud, the SEC’s very pur-\npose is to root it out, and it has many legal tools at hand to\naid in that pursuit. It can demand that securities brokers\nand dealers submit detailed trading information. Id., at\n44. It can require investment advisers to turn over their\ncomprehensive books and records at any time. 15 U. S. C.\n§80b–4 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). And even without fil-\ning suit, it can subpoena any documents and witnesses\nit deems relevant or material to an investigation. See\n§§77s(c), 78u(b), 80a–41(b), 80b–9(b) (2006 ed.).\n   The SEC is also authorized to pay monetary awards to\nwhistleblowers, who provide information relating to viola-\ntions of the securities laws. §78u–6 (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nIn addition, the SEC may offer “cooperation agreements”\nto violators to procure information about others in ex-\nchange for more lenient treatment. See Enforcement\nManual, at 119–137. Charged with this mission and\narmed with these weapons, the SEC as enforcer is a far\ncry from the defrauded victim the discovery rule evolved to\nprotect.\n   In a civil penalty action, the Government is not only a\ndifferent kind of plaintiff, it seeks a different kind of relief.\nThe discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive\nrecompense. But this case involves penalties, which go\nbeyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label\ndefendants wrongdoers. See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R.\nCo., 236 U. S. 412, 423 (1915) (a penalty covered by the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor to §2462 is “something imposed in a punitive\nway for an infraction of a public law”); see also Tull v.\nUnited States, 481 U. S. 412, 422 (1987) (penalties are\n“intended to punish culpable individuals,” not “to extract\ncompensation or restore the status quo”).\n  Chief Justice Marshall used particularly forceful lan-\nguage in emphasizing the importance of time limits on\npenalty actions, stating that it “would be utterly repug-\nnant to the genius of our laws” if actions for penalties\ncould “be brought at any distance of time.” Adams v.\nWoods, 2 Cranch 336, 342 (1805). Yet grafting the discov-\nery rule onto §2462 would raise similar concerns. It would\nleave defendants exposed to Government enforcement\naction not only for five years after their misdeeds, but for\nan additional uncertain period into the future. Repose\nwould hinge on speculation about what the Government\nknew, when it knew it, and when it should have known it.\nSee Rotella, 528 U. S., at 554 (disapproving a rule that\nwould have “extended the limitations period to many\ndecades” because such a rule was “beyond any limit that\nCongress could have contemplated” and “would have\nthwarted the basic objective of repose underlying the very\nnotion of a limitations period”).\n  Determining when the Government, as opposed to an\nindividual, knew or reasonably should have known of a\nfraud presents particular challenges for the courts. Agen-\ncies often have hundreds of employees, dozens of offices,\nand several levels of leadership. In such a case, when does\n“the Government” know of a violation? Who is the rele-\nvant actor? Different agencies often have overlapping\nresponsibilities; is the knowledge of one attributed to all?\n  In determining what a plaintiff should have known, we\nask what facts “a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered.” Merck & Co., 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nIt is unclear whether and how courts should consider\nagency priorities and resource constraints in applying that\n10                     GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntest to Government enforcement actions. See 3M Co. v.\nBrowner, 17 F. 3d 1453, 1461 (CADC 1994) (“An agency\nmay experience problems in detecting statutory violations\nbecause its enforcement effort is not sufficiently funded; or\nbecause the agency has not devoted an adequate number\nof trained personnel to the task; or because the agency’s\nenforcement program is ill-designed or inefficient; or\nbecause the nature of the statute makes it difficult to\nuncover violations; or because of some combination of\nthese factors and others”). And in the midst of any inquiry\nas to what it knew when, the Government can be expected\nto assert various privileges, such as law enforcement,\nattorney-client, work product, or deliberative process,\nfurther complicating judicial attempts to apply the discov-\nery rule. See, e.g., App. in No. 10–3581 (CA2), p. 147\n(Government invoking such privileges in this case, in\nresponse to a request for documents relating to the SEC’s\ninvestigation of Headstart); see also Rotella, supra, at 559\n(rejecting a rule in part due to “the controversy inherent in\ndivining when a plaintiff should have discovered” a\nwrong).\n  To be sure, Congress has expressly required such inquir-\nies in some statutes. But in many of those instances, the\nGovernment is itself an injured victim looking for recom-\npense, not a prosecutor seeking penalties. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §§2415, 2416(c) (Government suits for money dam-\nages founded on contracts or torts). Moreover, statutes\napplying a discovery rule in the context of Govern-\nment suits often couple that rule with an absolute provi-\nsion for repose, which a judicially imposed discovery rule\nwould lack. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §335b(b)(3) (limiting\ncertain Government civil penalty actions to “6 years after\nthe date when facts material to the act are known or\nreasonably should have been known by the Secretary but\nin no event more than 10 years after the date the act\ntook place”). And several statutes applying a discovery\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

C.\n§3731(b)(2) (relevant knowledge is that of “the official of\nthe United States charged with responsibility to act in the\ncircumstances”).\n   Applying a discovery rule to Government penalty ac-\ntions is far more challenging than applying the rule to\nsuits by defrauded victims, and we have no mandate from\nCongress to undertake that challenge here.\n                           *     *    *\n  As we held long ago, the cases in which “a statute of\nlimitation may be suspended by causes not mentioned in\nthe statute itself . . . are very limited in character, and are\nto be admitted with great caution; otherwise the court\nwould make the law instead of administering it.” Amy v.\nWatertown (No. 2), 130 U.

Argued January 8, 2013—Decided February 27, 2013\nThe Investment Advisers Act makes it illegal for investment advisers to\n  defraud their clients, 15 U. S. C. §§80b–6(1), (2), and authorizes the\n  Securities and Exchange Commission to bring enforcement actions\n  against investment advisers who violate the Act, or against individu-\n  als who aid and abet such violations, §80b–9(d). If the SEC seeks civ-\n  il penalties as part of those actions, it must file suit “within five years\n  from the date when the claim first accrued,” pursuant to a general\n  statute of limitations that governs many penalty provisions through-\n  out the U. S. Code, 28 U. S. C. §2462.\n     In 2008, the SEC sought civil penalties from petitioners Alpert and\n  Gabelli. The complaint alleged that they aided and abetted invest-\n  ment adviser fraud from 1999 until 2002. Petitioners moved to dis-\n  miss, arguing in part that the civil penalty claim was untimely. In-\n  voking the five-year statute of limitations in §2462, they pointed out\n  that the complaint alleged illegal activity up until August 2002 but\n  was not filed until April 2008. The District Court agreed and dis-\n  missed the civil penalty claim as time barred. The Second Circuit re-\n  versed, accepting the SEC’s argument that because the underlying\n  violations sounded in fraud, the “discovery rule” applied, meaning\n  that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the SEC dis-\n  covered or reasonably could have discovered the fraud.\nHeld: The five-year clock in §2462 begins to tick when the fraud occurs,\n not when it is discovered. Pp. 4–11.\n    (a) This is the most natural reading of the statute. “In common\n parlance a right accrues when it comes into existence.” United States\n v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569. The “standard rule” is that a claim\n accrues “when the plaintiff has ‘ “a complete and present cause of ac-\n2                            GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion.” ’ ” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 388. Such an understanding\n    appears in cases and dictionaries from the 19th century, when the\n    predecessor to §2462 was enacted. And this reading sets a fixed date\n    when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts ends,\n    advancing “the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,\n    elimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plaintiff’s oppor-\n    tunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential liabilities.” Rotella v.\n    Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Government nonetheless argues that the discovery rule\n    should apply here. That doctrine is an “exception” to the standard\n    rule, and delays accrual “until a plaintiff has ‘discovered’ ” his cause\n    of action. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U. S. ___, ___. It arose from\n    the recognition that “something different was needed in the case of\n    fraud, where a defendant’s deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff\n    from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. Thus\n    “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and ‘remains in igno-\n    rance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,\n    the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discov-\n    ered.’ ” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397. This Court, how-\n    ever, has never applied the discovery rule in this context, where the\n    plaintiff is not a defrauded victim seeking recompense, but is instead\n    the Government bringing an enforcement action for civil penalties.\n    The Government’s case is not saved by Exploration Co. v. United\n    States, 247 U. S. 435. There, the discovery rule was applied in favor\n    of the Government, but the Government was itself a victim; it had\n    been defrauded and was suing to recover its loss. It was not bringing\n    an enforcement action for penalties.\n       There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been\n    extended to Government civil penalty enforcement actions. The dis-\n    covery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of parties who have\n    no reason to suspect fraud. The Government is a different kind of\n    plaintiff. The SEC’s very purpose, for example, is to root out fraud,\n    and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit. The Gov-\n    ernment in these types of cases also seeks a different type of relief.\n    The discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive recom-\n    pense, but civil penalties go beyond compensation, are intended to\n    punish, and label defendants wrongdoers. Emphasizing the im-\n    portance of time limits on penalty actions, Chief Justice Marshall\n    admonished that it “would be utterly repugnant to the genius of our\n    laws” if actions for penalties could “be brought at any distance of\n    time.” Adams v. Woods, 2 Cranch 336, 342. Yet grafting the discov-\n    ery rule onto §2462 would raise similar concerns. It would leave de-\n    fendants exposed to Government enforcement action not only for five\n    years after their misdeeds, but for an additional uncertain period into\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

And repose would hinge on speculation about what the\n  Government knew, when it knew it, and when it should have known\n  it. Deciding when the Government knew or reasonably should have\n  known of a fraud would also present particular challenges for the\n  courts, such as determining who the relevant actor is in assessing\n  Government knowledge, whether and how to consider agency priori-\n  ties and resource constraints in deciding when the Government rea-\n  sonably should have known of a fraud, and so on. Applying a discov-\n  ery rule to Government penalty actions is far more challenging than\n  applying the rule to suits by defrauded victims, and the Court de-\n  clines to do so.

Under the general\nstatute of limitations for civil penalty actions, the SEC has\nfive years to seek such penalties. The question is whether\nthe five-year clock begins to tick when the fraud is com-\nplete or when the fraud is discovered.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, it is unlaw-\nful for an investment adviser “to employ any device,\nscheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective\nclient” or “to engage in any transaction, practice, or course\nof business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any\nclient or prospective client.” 54 Stat. 852, as amended, 15\nU. S. C. §§80b–6(1), (2). The Securities and Exchange\nCommission is authorized to bring enforcement actions\n2                      GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagainst investment advisers who violate the Act, or indi-\nviduals who aid and abet such violations. §80b–9(d).\n  As part of such enforcement actions, the SEC may seek\ncivil penalties, §§80b–9(e), (f) (2006 ed. and Supp. V), in\nwhich case a five-year statute of limitations applies:\n    “Except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, an\n    action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any\n    civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or other-\n    wise, shall not be entertained unless commenced\n    within five years from the date when the claim first ac-\n    crued if, within the same period, the offender or the\n    property is found within the United States in order\n    that proper service may be made thereon.” 28 U. S. C.\n    §2462.\nThis statute of limitations is not specific to the Investment\nAdvisers Act, or even to securities law; it governs many\npenalty provisions throughout the U. S. Code. Its origins\ndate back to at least 1839, and it took on its current form\nin 1948. See Act of Feb. 28, 1839, ch. 36, §4, 5 Stat. 322.\n                             B\n  Gabelli Funds, LLC, is an investment adviser to a mu-\ntual fund formerly known as Gabelli Global Growth Fund\n(GGGF). Petitioner Bruce Alpert is Gabelli Funds’ chief\noperating officer, and petitioner Marc Gabelli used to be\nGGGF’s portfolio manager.\n  In 2008, the SEC brought a civil enforcement action\nagainst Alpert and Gabelli. According to the complaint,\nfrom 1999 until 2002 Alpert and Gabelli allowed one\nGGGF investor—Headstart Advisers, Ltd.—to engage in\n“market timing” in the fund.\n  As this Court has explained, “[m]arket timing is a trad-\ning strategy that exploits time delay in mutual funds’\ndaily valuation system.” Janus Capital Group, Inc. v.\nFirst Derivative Traders, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 1 (2011)\n                    Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(slip op., at 2, n. 1). Mutual funds are typically valued\nonce a day, at the close of the New York Stock Exchange.\nBecause funds often hold securities traded on different\nexchanges around the world, their reported valuation may\nbe based on stale information. If a mutual fund’s reported\nvaluation is artificially low compared to its real value,\nmarket timers will buy that day and sell the next to real-\nize quick profits. Market timing is not illegal but can\nharm long-term investors in a fund. See id., at ___–___,\nand n. 1 (slip op., at 2–3, and n. 1).\n   The SEC’s complaint alleged that Alpert and Gabelli\npermitted Headstart to engage in market timing in ex-\nchange for Headstart’s investment in a hedge fund run by\nGabelli. According to the SEC, petitioners did not disclose\nHeadstart’s market timing or the quid pro quo agreement,\nand instead banned others from engaging in market\ntiming and made statements indicating that the practice\nwould not be tolerated. The complaint stated that during\nthe relevant period, Headstart earned rates of return of up\nto 185%, while “the rate of return for long-term investors\nin GGGF was no more than negative 24.1 percent.” App.\n73.\n   The SEC alleged that Alpert and Gabelli aided and\nabetted violations of §§80b–6(1) and (2), and it sought civil\npenalties under §80b–9. Petitioners moved to dismiss,\narguing in part that the claim for civil penalties was un-\ntimely. They invoked the five-year statute of limitations\nin §2462, pointing out that the complaint alleged market\ntiming up until August 2002 but was not filed until April\n2008. The District Court agreed and dismissed the SEC’s\ncivil penalty claim as time barred.1\n   The Second Circuit reversed. It acknowledged that\n——————\n  1 The SEC also sought injunctive relief and disgorgement, claims the\n\nDistrict Court found timely on the ground that they were not subject to\n§2462. Those issues are not before us.\n4                         GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n§2462 required an action for civil penalties to be brought\nwithin five years “from the date when the claim first\naccrued,” but accepted the SEC’s argument that because\nthe underlying violations sounded in fraud, the “discovery\nrule” applied to the statute of limitations. As explained by\nthe Second Circuit, “[u]nder the discovery rule, the statute\nof limitations for a particular claim does not accrue until\nthat claim is discovered, or could have been discovered\nwith reasonable diligence, by the plaintiff.” 653 F. 3d 49,\n59 (2011). The court concluded that while “this rule does\nnot govern the accrual of most claims,” it does govern the\nclaims at issue here. Ibid. As the court explained, “for\nclaims that sound in fraud a discovery rule is read into the\nrelevant statute of limitation.” Id., at 60.2\n  We granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  This case centers around the meaning of 28 U. S. C.\n§2462: “an action . . . for the enforcement of any civil fine,\npenalty, or forfeiture . . . shall not be entertained unless\ncommenced within five years from the date when the\nclaim first accrued.” Petitioners argue that a claim based\non fraud accrues—and the five-year clock begins to tick—\nwhen a defendant’s allegedly fraudulent conduct occurs.\n  That is the most natural reading of the statute. “In\ncommon parlance a right accrues when it comes into exist-\nence . . . .” United States v. Lindsay, 346 U. S. 568, 569\n——————\n  2 The court distinguished the discovery rule, which governs when a\n\nclaim accrues, from doctrines that toll the running of an applicable\nlimitations period when the defendant takes steps beyond the chal-\nlenged conduct itself to conceal that conduct from the plaintiff. 653\nF. 3d, at 59–60. The SEC abandoned any reliance on such doctrines\nbelow, and they are not before us.

Thus the “standard rule” is that a claim accrues\n“when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of\naction.” Wallace v. Kato, 549 U. S. 384, 388 (2007) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Bay Area\nLaundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar\nCorp. of Cal., 522 U. S. 192, 201 (1997); Clark v. Iowa City,\n20 Wall. 583, 589 (1875). That rule has governed since the\n1830s when the predecessor to §2462 was enacted. See,\ne.g., Bank of United States v. Daniel, 12 Pet. 32, 56 (1838);\nEvans v. Gee, 11 Pet. 80, 84 (1837). And that definition\nappears in dictionaries from the 19th century up until\ntoday. See, e.g., 1 A. Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glos-\nsary 17 (1850) (“an action accrues when the plaintiff has a\nright to commence it”); Black’s Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed.\n2009) (defining “accrue” as “[t]o come into existence as an\nenforceable claim or right”).\n   This reading sets a fixed date when exposure to the\nspecified Government enforcement efforts ends, advancing\n“the basic policies of all limitations provisions: repose,\nelimination of stale claims, and certainty about a plain-\ntiff ’s opportunity for recovery and a defendant’s potential\nliabilities.” Rotella v. Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 555 (2000).\nStatutes of limitations are intended to “promote justice by\npreventing surprises through the revival of claims that\nhave been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,\nmemories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.”\nRailroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.,\n321 U. S. 342, 348–349 (1944). They provide “security and\nstability to human affairs.” Wood v. Carpenter, 101 U. S.\n135, 139 (1879). We have deemed them “vital to the\nwelfare of society,” ibid., and concluded that “even wrong-\ndoers are entitled to assume that their sins may be forgot-\nten,” Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.

SEC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nargues that the discovery rule should apply instead.\nUnder this rule, accrual is delayed “until the plaintiff has\n‘discovered’ ” his cause of action. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds,\n559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 8). The doctrine arose\nin 18th-century fraud cases as an “exception” to the stand-\nard rule, based on the recognition that “something differ-\nent was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant’s\ndeceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even know-\ning that he or she has been defrauded.” Ibid. This Court\nhas held that “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud\nand ‘remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want\nof diligence or care on his part, the bar of the statute does\nnot begin to run until the fraud is discovered.’ ” Holmberg\nv. Armbrecht, 327 U. S. 392, 397 (1946) (quoting Bailey v.\nGlover, 21 Wall. 342, 348 (1875)). And we have explained\nthat “fraud is deemed to be discovered when, in the exer-\ncise of reasonable diligence, it could have been discovered.”\nMerck & Co., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quota-\ntion marks and alterations omitted).\n   But we have never applied the discovery rule in this\ncontext, where the plaintiff is not a defrauded victim\nseeking recompense, but is instead the Government bring-\ning an enforcement action for civil penalties. Despite the\ndiscovery rule’s centuries-old roots, the Government cites\nno lower court case before 2008 employing a fraud-based\ndiscovery rule in a Government enforcement action for\ncivil penalties. See Brief for Respondent 23 (citing SEC v.\nTambone, 550 F. 3d 106, 148–149 (CA1 2008); SEC v.\nKoenig, 557 F. 3d 736, 739 (CA7 2009)). When pressed at\noral argument, the Government conceded that it was\naware of no such case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25. The Govern-\nment was also unable to point to any example from the\nfirst 160 years after enactment of this statute of limita-\ntions where it had even asserted that the fraud discovery\nrule applied in such a context. Id., at 26–27 (citing only\nUnited States v. Maillard, 26 F. Cas. 1140, 1142 (No.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n15,709) (SDNY 1871), a “fraudulent concealment” case, see\nn. 2, supra).\n   Instead the Government relies heavily on Exploration\nCo. v. United States, 247 U. S. 435 (1918), in an attempt to\nshow that the discovery rule should benefit the Govern-\nment to the same extent as private parties. See, e.g., Brief\nfor Respondent 10–11, 16, 17, 33–34, 41–45. In that\ncase, a company had fraudulently procured land from the\nUnited States, and the United States sued to undo the trans-\naction. The company raised the statute of limitations as a\ndefense, but this Court allowed the case to proceed, con-\ncluding that the rule “that statutes of limitations upon\nsuits to set aside fraudulent transactions shall not begin\nto run until the discovery of the fraud” applied “in favor of\nthe Government as well as a private individual.” Explora-\ntion Co., supra, at 449. But in Exploration Co., the Gov-\nernment was itself a victim; it had been defrauded and\nwas suing to recover its loss. The Government was not\nbringing an enforcement action for penalties. Exploration\nCo. cannot save the Government’s case here.\n   There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has\nnot been extended to Government enforcement actions for\ncivil penalties. The discovery rule exists in part to pre-\nserve the claims of victims who do not know they are\ninjured and who reasonably do not inquire as to any\ninjury. Usually when a private party is injured, he is imme-\ndiately aware of that injury and put on notice that his time\nto sue is running. But when the injury is self-concealing,\nprivate parties may be unaware that they have been\nharmed. Most of us do not live in a state of constant in-\nvestigation; absent any reason to think we have been\ninjured, we do not typically spend our days looking for\nevidence that we were lied to or defrauded. And the law\ndoes not require that we do so. Instead, courts have de-\nveloped the discovery rule, providing that the statute of\nlimitations in fraud cases should typically begin to run\n8                       GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nonly when the injury is or reasonably could have been\ndiscovered.\n   The same conclusion does not follow for the Government\nin the context of enforcement actions for civil penalties.\nThe SEC, for example, is not like an individual victim who\nrelies on apparent injury to learn of a wrong. Rather, a\ncentral “mission” of the Commission is to “investigat[e]\npotential violations of the federal securities laws.” SEC,\nEnforcement Manual 1 (2012). Unlike the private party\nwho has no reason to suspect fraud, the SEC’s very pur-\npose is to root it out, and it has many legal tools at hand to\naid in that pursuit. It can demand that securities brokers\nand dealers submit detailed trading information. Id., at\n44. It can require investment advisers to turn over their\ncomprehensive books and records at any time. 15 U. S. C.\n§80b–4 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). And even without fil-\ning suit, it can subpoena any documents and witnesses\nit deems relevant or material to an investigation. See\n§§77s(c), 78u(b), 80a–41(b), 80b–9(b) (2006 ed.).\n   The SEC is also authorized to pay monetary awards to\nwhistleblowers, who provide information relating to viola-\ntions of the securities laws. §78u–6 (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nIn addition, the SEC may offer “cooperation agreements”\nto violators to procure information about others in ex-\nchange for more lenient treatment. See Enforcement\nManual, at 119–137. Charged with this mission and\narmed with these weapons, the SEC as enforcer is a far\ncry from the defrauded victim the discovery rule evolved to\nprotect.\n   In a civil penalty action, the Government is not only a\ndifferent kind of plaintiff, it seeks a different kind of relief.\nThe discovery rule helps to ensure that the injured receive\nrecompense. But this case involves penalties, which go\nbeyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label\ndefendants wrongdoers. See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R.\nCo., 236 U. S. 412, 423 (1915) (a penalty covered by the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor to §2462 is “something imposed in a punitive\nway for an infraction of a public law”); see also Tull v.\nUnited States, 481 U. S. 412, 422 (1987) (penalties are\n“intended to punish culpable individuals,” not “to extract\ncompensation or restore the status quo”).\n  Chief Justice Marshall used particularly forceful lan-\nguage in emphasizing the importance of time limits on\npenalty actions, stating that it “would be utterly repug-\nnant to the genius of our laws” if actions for penalties\ncould “be brought at any distance of time.” Adams v.\nWoods, 2 Cranch 336, 342 (1805). Yet grafting the discov-\nery rule onto §2462 would raise similar concerns. It would\nleave defendants exposed to Government enforcement\naction not only for five years after their misdeeds, but for\nan additional uncertain period into the future. Repose\nwould hinge on speculation about what the Government\nknew, when it knew it, and when it should have known it.\nSee Rotella, 528 U. S., at 554 (disapproving a rule that\nwould have “extended the limitations period to many\ndecades” because such a rule was “beyond any limit that\nCongress could have contemplated” and “would have\nthwarted the basic objective of repose underlying the very\nnotion of a limitations period”).\n  Determining when the Government, as opposed to an\nindividual, knew or reasonably should have known of a\nfraud presents particular challenges for the courts. Agen-\ncies often have hundreds of employees, dozens of offices,\nand several levels of leadership. In such a case, when does\n“the Government” know of a violation? Who is the rele-\nvant actor? Different agencies often have overlapping\nresponsibilities; is the knowledge of one attributed to all?\n  In determining what a plaintiff should have known, we\nask what facts “a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have\ndiscovered.” Merck & Co., 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\nIt is unclear whether and how courts should consider\nagency priorities and resource constraints in applying that\n10                     GABELLI v. SEC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntest to Government enforcement actions. See 3M Co. v.\nBrowner, 17 F. 3d 1453, 1461 (CADC 1994) (“An agency\nmay experience problems in detecting statutory violations\nbecause its enforcement effort is not sufficiently funded; or\nbecause the agency has not devoted an adequate number\nof trained personnel to the task; or because the agency’s\nenforcement program is ill-designed or inefficient; or\nbecause the nature of the statute makes it difficult to\nuncover violations; or because of some combination of\nthese factors and others”). And in the midst of any inquiry\nas to what it knew when, the Government can be expected\nto assert various privileges, such as law enforcement,\nattorney-client, work product, or deliberative process,\nfurther complicating judicial attempts to apply the discov-\nery rule. See, e.g., App. in No. 10–3581 (CA2), p. 147\n(Government invoking such privileges in this case, in\nresponse to a request for documents relating to the SEC’s\ninvestigation of Headstart); see also Rotella, supra, at 559\n(rejecting a rule in part due to “the controversy inherent in\ndivining when a plaintiff should have discovered” a\nwrong).\n  To be sure, Congress has expressly required such inquir-\nies in some statutes. But in many of those instances, the\nGovernment is itself an injured victim looking for recom-\npense, not a prosecutor seeking penalties. See, e.g., 28\nU. S. C. §§2415, 2416(c) (Government suits for money dam-\nages founded on contracts or torts). Moreover, statutes\napplying a discovery rule in the context of Govern-\nment suits often couple that rule with an absolute provi-\nsion for repose, which a judicially imposed discovery rule\nwould lack. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §335b(b)(3) (limiting\ncertain Government civil penalty actions to “6 years after\nthe date when facts material to the act are known or\nreasonably should have been known by the Secretary but\nin no event more than 10 years after the date the act\ntook place”). And several statutes applying a discovery\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrule to the Government make some effort to identify the\nofficial whose knowledge is relevant. See 31 U. S. C.\n§3731(b)(2) (relevant knowledge is that of “the official of\nthe United States charged with responsibility to act in the\ncircumstances”).\n   Applying a discovery rule to Government penalty ac-\ntions is far more challenging than applying the rule to\nsuits by defrauded victims, and we have no mandate from\nCongress to undertake that challenge here.\n                           *     *    *\n  As we held long ago, the cases in which “a statute of\nlimitation may be suspended by causes not mentioned in\nthe statute itself . . . are very limited in character, and are\nto be admitted with great caution; otherwise the court\nwould make the law instead of administering it.” Amy v.\nWatertown (No. 2), 130 U. S. 320, 324 (1889) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).
