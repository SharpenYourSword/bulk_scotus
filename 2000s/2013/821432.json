CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT\n          PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11\u20131085. Argued November 5, 2012\u2014Decided February 27, 2013\nTo recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under \u00a710(b) of\n  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange\n  Commission Rule 10b\u20135, a plaintiff must prove, among other things,\n  reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the de-\n  fendant. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___, ___.\n  Requiring proof of direct reliance \u201cwould place an unnecessarily un-\n  realistic evidentiary burden on [a] plaintiff who has traded on an im-\n  personal market.\u201d Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245. Thus,\n  this Court has endorsed a \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory, which per-\n  mits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\n  reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities\n  traded in an efficient market. Id., at 241\u2013249. The fraud-on-the-\n  market theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class ac-\n  tions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.\n     Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut\n  Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought\n  certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of\n  Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc.\n  and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen). The District Court\n  certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit\n  rejected Amgen\u2019s argument that Connecticut Retirement was re-\n  quired to prove the materiality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresenta-\n  tions and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule\n  23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class\n  members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n  members.\u201d The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did\n  not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had pre-\n2       AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n\n                        AND TRUST FUNDS                                        \n\n                             Syllabus\n\n\n    sented on the issue of materiality at the class-certification stage.\nHeld: Proof of materiality is not a prerequisite to certification of a secu-\n rities-fraud class action seeking money damages for alleged violations\n of \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135. Pp. 9\u201326.\n    (a) The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality\n is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\n class will \u201cpredominate over any questions affecting only individual\n members\u201d as the litigation progresses. For two reasons, the answer\n to this question is \u201cno.\u201d First, because materiality is judged accord-\n ing to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence com-\n mon to the class. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S.\n 438, 445. Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.\n Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality\n would not result in individual questions predominating. Instead, it\n would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a secu-\n rities-fraud claim. Pp. 9\u201314.\n    (b) Amgen\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 14\u2013\n 24.\n      (1) Amgen points to the Court\u2019s statement in Erica P. John\n Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___, that \u201csecurities\n fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic\u2019s\n rebuttable presumption of reliance,\u201d including \u201cthat the alleged mis-\n representations were publicly known . . . , that the stock traded in an\n efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place \u2018be-\n tween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the\n truth was revealed.\u2019 \u201d If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must\n be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality\u2014\n another fraud-on-the-market predicate\u2014should be treated no differ-\n ently. The Court disagrees. The requirement that a putative class\n representative establish that it executed trades \u201cbetween the time\n the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was re-\n vealed\u201d relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into\n typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\n predominance inquiry. And unlike materiality, market efficiency and\n the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispen-\n sable elements of a Rule 10\u20135 claim. While the failure of common,\n classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the pro-\n spect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof\n on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.\n Pp. 15\u201318.\n      (2) Amgen also contends that \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d militate in\n favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality. Because class\n certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle\n rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at\n  the class-certification stage. In this regard, however, materiality\n  does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim,\n  notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which\n  the plaintiff \u2019s claims are based were false or misleading and that the\n  alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer econom-\n  ic loss. Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures as-\n  sociated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected\n  calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory. And contrary to\n  Amgen\u2019s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class\n  certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen\u2019s position\n  would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materi-\n  ality at the class-certification stage. Pp. 18\u201322.\n     (c) Also unavailing is Amgen\u2019s claim that the District Court erred\n  by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in op-\n  posing Connecticut Retirement\u2019s class-certification motion. The\n  Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen\u2019s\n  rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and\n  omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint were imma-\n  terial. The potential immateriality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresen-\n  tations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common\n  questions predominate. Just as a plaintiff class\u2019s inability to prove\n  materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predomi-\n  nate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not un-\n  dermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

CONNECTICUT\n   RETIREMENT PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 27, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case involves a securities-fraud complaint filed\nby Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Con\u00ad\nnecticut Retirement) against biotechnology company\nAmgen Inc. and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen).\nSeeking class-action certification under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23, Connecticut Retirement invoked the\n\u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d presumption endorsed by this Court\nin Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), and recog-\nnized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011). The fraud-on-the-market\npremise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient\nmarket will reflect all publicly available information about\na company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be\npresumed to have relied on that information in purchasing\nthe security.\n   Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for\nthe securities at issue and has not contested the public\ncharacter of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which\nConnecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint is based. Nor does\nAmgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets\n2     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a):\n(1) the alleged class \u201cis so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable\u201d; (2) \u201cthere are questions of law\nor fact common to the class\u201d; (3) Connecticut Retirement\u2019s\nclaims are \u201ctypical of the claims . . . of the class\u201d; and (4)\nConnecticut Retirement will \u201cfairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.\u201d\n  The issue presented concerns the requirement stated in\nRule 23(b)(3) that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members.\u201d Amgen contends that to meet\nthe predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement\nmust do more than plausibly plead that Amgen\u2019s alleged\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions materially\naffected Amgen\u2019s stock price. According to Amgen, certifi\u00ad\ncation must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement\nproves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or\nomissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen\u2019s\nstock price in an efficient market.\n  While Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove\nmateriality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such\nproof is not a prerequisite to class certification. Rule\n23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the\nclass predominate, not that those questions will be an\u00ad\nswered, on the merits, in favor of the class. Because mate\u00ad\nriality is judged according to an objective standard, the\nmateriality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is a question common to all members of the\nclass Connecticut Retirement would represent. The al\u00ad\nleged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material\nor immaterial, would be so equally for all investors com\u00ad\nposing the class. As vital, the plaintiff class\u2019s inability to\nprove materiality would not result in individual questions\npredominating. Instead, a failure of proof on the issue\nof materiality would end the case, given that materiality\nis an essential element of the class members\u2019 securities\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In no\nevent will the individual circumstances of particular class\nmembers bear on the inquiry.\n   Essentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today\u2019s\ndecision, would have us put the cart before the horse. To\ngain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the\ndissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first estab\u00ad\nlish that it will win the fray. But the office of a Rule\n23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case;\nrather, it is to select the \u201cmetho[d]\u201d best suited to adjudi\u00ad\ncation of the controversy \u201cfairly and efficiently.\u201d\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case involves the interaction between federal\nsecurities-fraud laws and Rule 23\u2019s requirements for\nclass certification. To obtain certification of a class ac-\ntion for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff\nmust satisfy Rule 23(a)\u2019s above-mentioned prerequisites\nof numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation, see supra, at 1\u20132, and must also establish\nthat \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class mem\u00ad\nbers predominate over any questions affecting only indi\u00ad\nvidual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudi\u00ad\ncating the controversy.\u201d To recover damages in a private\nsecurities-fraud action under \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15\nU.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201cThe traditional (and most\ndirect) way\u201d for a plaintiff to demonstrate reliance \u201cis by\nshowing that he was aware of a company\u2019s statement and\nengaged in a relevant transaction . . . based on that specific\nmisrepresentation.\u201d Ibid. We have recognized, however,\nthat requiring proof of direct reliance \u201cwould place an\nunnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on [a] plain\u00ad\ntiff who has traded on an impersonal market.\u201d Basic, 485\nU. S., at 245. Accordingly, in Basic the Court endorsed the\n\u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory, which permits certain Rule\n10b\u20135 plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\nreliance on material misrepresentations aired to the gen\u00ad\neral public. Id., at 241\u2013249.1\n   The fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise\nthat certain well developed markets are efficient proces\u00ad\nsors of public information. In such markets, the \u201cmarket\nprice of shares\u201d will \u201creflec[t] all publicly available infor\u00ad\nmation.\u201d Id., at 246. Few investors in such markets, if\nany, can consistently achieve above-market returns by\ntrading based on publicly available information alone, for\nif such above-market returns were readily attainable, it\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Part IV of Justice Blackmun\u2019s opinion in Basic\u2014the part endors\u00ad\n\ning the fraud-on-the-market theory\u2014was joined by Justices Brennan,\nMarshall, and Stevens. Together, these Justices composed a majority\nof the quorum of six Justices who participated in the case. See 28\nU. S.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould mean that market prices were not efficiently incor\u00ad\nporating the full supply of public information. See R.\nBrealey, S. Myers, & F. Allen, Principles of Corporate\nFinance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (\u201c[I]n an efficient market,\nthere is no way for most investors to achieve consistently\nsuperior rates of return.\u201d).\n  In Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be effi\u00ad\ncient, courts may presume that investors who traded\nsecurities in that market relied on public, material mis\u00ad\nrepresentations regarding those securities. See 485 U. S.,\nat 245\u2013247. This presumption springs from the very\nconcept of market efficiency. If a market is generally\nefficient in incorporating publicly available information\ninto a security\u2019s market price, it is reasonable to presume\nthat a particular public, material misrepresentation will\nbe reflected in the security\u2019s price. Furthermore, it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors\u2014knowing that\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa\u00ad\nble information\u2014will rely on the security\u2019s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security\u2019s value in light of\nall public information. Thus, courts may presume that\ninvestors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on\npublic, material misrepresentations through their \u201creli\u00ad\nance on the integrity of the price set by the market.\u201d Id.,\nat 245. \u201c[T]he presumption,\u201d however, is \u201cjust that, and\n[can] be rebutted by appropriate evidence.\u201d Halliburton,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5). See also Basic, 485 U. S.,\nat 248\u2013249 (providing examples of showings that would\nrebut the fraud-on-the-market presumption).\n  Although fraud on the market is a substantive doctrine\nof federal securities-fraud law that can be invoked by any\nRule 10b\u20135 plaintiff, see, e.g., Black v. Finantra Capital,\nInc., 418 F. 3d 203, 209 (CA2 2005); Blackie v. Barrack,\n524 F. 2d 891, 908 (CA9 1975), the doctrine has particular\nsignificance in securities-fraud class actions. Absent the\n6       AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                       AND TRUST FUNDS\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nfraud-on-the-market theory, the requirement that Rule\n10b\u20135 plaintiffs establish reliance would ordinarily pre\u00ad\nclude certification of a class action seeking money dam-\nages because individual reliance issues would overwhelm\nquestions common to the class. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242. The fraud-on-the-market theory, however, facilitates\nclass certification by recognizing a rebuttable presumption\nof classwide reliance on public, material misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions when shares are traded in an efficient market. Ibid.2\n                             B\n   In its complaint, Connecticut Retirement alleges that\nAmgen violated \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135 through certain\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions regarding\nthe safety, efficacy, and marketing of two of its flagship\ndrugs.3 According to Connecticut Retirement, these mis\u00ad\nrepresentations and omissions artificially inflated the\nprice of Amgen\u2019s stock at the time Connecticut Retirement\nand numerous other securities buyers purchased the\nstock. When the truth came to light, Connecticut Retire\u00ad\nment asserts, Amgen\u2019s stock price declined, resulting in\nfinancial losses to those who purchased the stock at the\ninflated price.

After\ngranting Amgen\u2019s request to take an interlocutory appeal\nfrom the District Court\u2019s class-certification order, see Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 23(f), the Court of Appeals affirmed. See\n660 F. 3d 1170 (CA9 2011).\n   Amgen raised two arguments on appeal. First, Amgen\ncontended that the District Court erred by certifying the\nproposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retire\u00ad\nment to prove that Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations\nand omissions were material. Second, Amgen argued that\nthe District Court erred by refusing to consider certain\nrebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition\nto Connecticut Retirement\u2019s class-certification motion.\nThis evidence, in Amgen\u2019s view, demonstrated that the\nmarket was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged\nmisrepresentations and omissions at the time the class\nmembers purchased their shares.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.\nAmgen\u2019s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made\nthe uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions and omissions \u201cby definition [do] not affect . . . stock\nprice[s] in an efficient market.\u201d Id., at 1175. Thus,\nwhere misrepresentations and omissions are not material,\nthere is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on\nthose misrepresentations and omissions through the\ninformation-processing mechanism of the market price.\n\u201cThe problem with that argument,\u201d the Court of Appeals ob\u00ad\nserved, is evident: \u201c[B]ecause materiality is an element of\n8    AMGEN INC. v.

The Court of Appeals thus concluded that\n\u201cproof of materiality is not necessary\u201d to ensure compli\u00ad\nance with Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that common ques\u00ad\ntions predominate. Id., at 1177.\n   With respect to Amgen\u2019s second argument, the Court of\nAppeals determined that Amgen\u2019s proffered rebuttal\nevidence was merely \u201ca method of refuting [the] materi-\nality\u201d of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged\nin Connecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint. Ibid. Having al-\nready concluded that a securities-fraud plaintiff does not\nneed to prove materiality before class certification, the\ncourt similarly held that \u201cthe district court correctly re\u00ad\nfused to consider\u201d Amgen\u2019s rebuttal evidence \u201cat the class\ncertification stage.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted Amgen\u2019s petition for certiorari, 567 U.

App.,\np. 144 (\u201c[A]n evaluation of the probable outcome on the\nmerits is not properly part of the certification decision.\u201d).\n   Bearing firmly in mind that the focus of Rule 23(b)(3)\nis on the predominance of common questions, we turn to\nAmgen\u2019s contention that the courts below erred by failing\nto require Connecticut Retirement to prove the material\u00ad\nity of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and omissions\nbefore certifying Connecticut Retirement\u2019s proposed class.\nAs Amgen notes, materiality is not only an element of the\nRule 10b\u20135 cause of action; it is also an essential predicate\nof the fraud-on-the-market theory. See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n247 (\u201c[W]here materially misleading statements have been\ndisseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market\n10    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the\nintegrity of the market price may be presumed.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is prem\u00ad\nised on the understanding that in an efficient market,\nall publicly available information is rapidly incorporated\ninto, and thus transmitted to investors through, the mar\u00ad\nket price. See id., at 246\u2013247. Because immaterial in-\nformation, by definition, does not affect market price,\nit cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar\u00ad\nket price\u2019s integrity. Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation\nor omission. And without the fraud-on-the-market theory,\nthe element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide\nbasis through evidence common to the class. See id., at\n242. It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality\nmust be proved before a securities-fraud class action can\nbe certified.\n   Contrary to Amgen\u2019s argument, the key question in this\ncase is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.4 In\u00ad\nstead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is\nneeded to ensure that the questions of law or fact common\nto the class will \u201cpredominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members\u201d as the litigation progresses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). For two reasons, the answer\nto this question is clearly \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that \u201c[m]ateriality was central to\n\nthe development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory both before Basic and in Basic itself.\u201d Post, at 18. We disagree,\nhowever, that the history of the fraud-on-the-market theory\u2019s develop\u00ad\nment \u201cconfirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the\ntheory is invoked\u2014i.e., at certification.\u201d Ibid. As explained below, see\ninfra this page and 11\u201313, proof of materiality is not required prior to\nclass certification because such proof is not necessary to ensure satis\u00ad\nfaction of Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, because \u201c[t]he question of materiality . . . is an\nobjective one, involving the significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,\u201d materiality\ncan be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 445\n(1976). Consequently, materiality is a \u201ccommon ques\u00ad\ntio[n]\u201d for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242 (listing \u201cmateriality\u201d as one of the questions common\nto the Basic class members).\n   Second, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof\non the common question of materiality will result in indi\u00ad\nvidual questions predominating. Because materiality is\nan essential element of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim, see Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut\nRetirement\u2019s failure to present sufficient evidence of mate\u00ad\nriality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail\nat trial would not cause individual reliance questions to\noverwhelm the questions common to the class. Instead,\nthe failure of proof on the element of materiality would\nend the case for one and for all; no claim would re\u00ad\nmain in which individual reliance issues could potentially\npredominate.\n   Totally misapprehending our essential point, JUSTICE\nTHOMAS\u2019 dissent asserts that our \u201centire argument is\nbased on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits.\u201d Post, at 11, n. 9. Our\nposition is not so based. We rest, instead, entirely on the\ntext of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification\nif \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.\u201d A failure of proof on the common question of\nmateriality ends the litigation and thus will never cause\nindividual questions of reliance or anything else to over\u00ad\nwhelm questions common to the class. Therefore, under\nthe plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not\n12    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to prove materiality at the class-certification\nstage. In other words, they need not, at that threshold,\nprove that the predominating question will be answered in\ntheir favor.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS urges that a plaintiff seeking class\ncertification \u201cmust show that the elements of [her] claim\nare susceptible to classwide proof.\u201d Post, at 7. See also\npost, at 11 (criticizing the Court for failing to focus its\nanalysis on \u201cwhether the element of reliance is susceptible\nto classwide proof \u201d). From this premise, JUSTICE THOMAS\nconcludes that Rule 10b\u20135 plaintiffs must prove material-\nity before class certification because (1) \u201cmateriality is a\nnecessary component of fraud on the market,\u201d and (2)\nwithout fraud on the market, the Rule 10b\u20135 element of\nreliance is not \u201csusceptible of a classwide answer.\u201d Post,\nat 6, 10\u201311. See also post, at 12 (\u201c[I]f a plaintiff wishes to\nuse Basic\u2019s presumption to prove that reliance is a com\u00ad\nmon question, he must establish the entire presumption,\nincluding materiality, at the class certification stage.\u201d).\n   Rule 23(b)(3), however, does not require a plaintiff\nseeking class certification to prove that each \u201celemen[t] of\n[her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof.\u201d Post, at 7.\nWhat the rule does require is that common questions\n\u201cpredominate over any questions affecting only individual\n[class] members.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3) (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does JUSTICE THOMAS explain how, in\nan action invoking the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nclass\u2019s failure to prove an essential element of its claim for\nrelief will result in individual questions predominating\nover common ones. Absent proof of materiality, the claim\nof the Rule 10b\u20135 class will fail in its entirety; there will\nbe no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.\n   Consequently, proof of materiality is not required to\nestablish that a proposed class is \u201csufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication by representation\u201d\u2014the focus of\nthe predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3).

No\ndoubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in\nwhich an individual investor might rely on immaterial\ninformation (think of the superstitious investor who sells\nher securities based on a CEO\u2019s statement that a black cat\ncrossed the CEO\u2019s path that morning). But such objectively\nunreasonable reliance does not give rise to a Rule 10b\u20135\nclaim. See TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 445 (materiality\nis judged by an objective standard). Thus, \u201cthe individual\u00ad\nized questions of reliance,\u201d post, at 9, n. 8, that hypotheti\u00ad\ncally might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality dooms the fraud-on-the-market class are far\nmore imaginative than real. Such \u201cindividualized ques\u00ad\ntions\u201d do not undermine class cohesion and thus cannot be\nsaid to \u201cpredominate\u201d for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).5\n   Because the question of materiality is common to the\nclass, and because a failure of proof on that issue would\nnot result in questions \u201caffecting only individual members\u201d\npredominating, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3), Connecticut\nRetirement was not required to prove the materiality of\nAmgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the\nclass-certification stage. This is not a case in which the\nasserted problem\u2014i.e., that the plaintiff class cannot\nprove materiality\u2014\u201cexhibits some fatal dissimilarity\u201d\namong class members that would make use of the class\u00ad\naction device inefficient or unfair. Nagareda, Class Certi\u00ad\nfication in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n97, 107 (2009).

The fact that such a failure of proof resolves all\nclass members\u2019 claims once and for all, leaving no individual issues to\nbe adjudicated, confirms that the original certification decision was\nproper.\n14     AMGEN INC. v.

Such a contention is\nproperly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a summary\u00ad\njudgment motion. The allegation should not be resolved in\ndeciding whether to certify a proposed class. Ibid. See\nalso Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 687 (\u201c[W]hether a statement\nis materially false is a question common to all class mem\u00ad\nbers and therefore may be resolved on a class-wide basis\nafter certification.\u201d).\n                             B\n  Insisting that materiality must be proved at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage, Amgen relies chiefly on two arguments,\nneither of which we find persuasive.6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Amgen advances a third argument founded on modern economic\n\nresearch tending to show that market efficiency is not \u201c \u2018a binary, yes or\nno question.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioners 32 (quoting Langevoort, Basic at\nTwenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 167).\nInstead, this research suggests, differences in efficiency can exist\nwithin a single market. For example, a market may more readily\nprocess certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible\ninformation, such as public merger announcements, than information\nmore difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical\ndata buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSee, e.g., Macey & Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of\nthe Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 1059, 1083\u20131087\n(1990); Stout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction\nto the New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 653\u2013656 (2003). Amgen,\nhowever, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency\nbolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof\nof materiality. In any event, this case is a poor vehicle for exploring\nwhatever implications the research Amgen cites may have for the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption recognized in Basic. As noted above,\nsee supra, at 6\u20137, Amgen conceded in its answer that the market for its\nsecurities is \u201cefficient\u201d and thus \u201cpromptly digest[s] current information\nregarding Amgen from all publicly available sources and reflect[s] such\ninformation in Amgen\u2019s stock price.\u201d Consolidated Amended Class\nAction Complaint \u00b6\u00b6199\u2013200; Answer \u00b6\u00b6199\u2013200.

As an initial matter, the requirement that\na putative class representative establish that it executed\ntrades \u201cbetween the time the misrepresentations were\nmade and the time the truth was revealed\u201d relates primar\u00ad\nily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into typicality\nand adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\npredominance inquiry.

We thus find nothing in the cited research\nthat would support requiring precertification proof of materiality in this\ncase.\n   7 As earlier noted, see supra, at 1\u20132, Amgen does not here contest\n16     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity\u2019s market price cannot be affected by a misrepre\u00ad\nsentation not yet made, and in an efficient market, a\nmisrepresentation\u2019s impact on market price is quickly\nnullified once the truth comes to light. Thus, a plaintiff\nwhose relevant transactions were not executed between\nthe time the misrepresentation was made and the time the\ntruth was revealed cannot be said to have indirectly relied\non the misrepresentation through its reliance on the in\u00ad\ntegrity of the market price.8 Such a plaintiff \u2019s claims,\ntherefore, would not be \u201ctypical\u201d of the claims of investors\nwho did trade during the window between misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion and truth revelation. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(3).\nNor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff\nwould \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests\u201d of\ninvestors who traded during the relevant window. Rule\n23(a)(4). The requirement that the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory\u2019s trade-timing predicate be established before\nclass certification thus sheds little light on the question\nwhether materiality must also be proved at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage.\n   Amgen is not aided by Halliburton\u2019s statement that\nmarket efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities\u00ad\nfraud class action can be certified. As Amgen notes, mar\u00ad\nket efficiency, publicity, and materiality can all be proved\non a classwide basis. Furthermore, they are all essential\npredicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory.

But unlike\nmateriality, market efficiency and publicity are not indis\u00ad\npensable elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim. See Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (listing ele\u00ad\nments of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim). Thus, where the market for\na security is inefficient or the defendant\u2019s alleged misrep\u00ad\nresentations were not aired publicly, a plaintiff cannot\ninvoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption. She can,\nhowever, attempt to establish reliance through the \u201ctradi\u00ad\ntional\u201d mode of demonstrating that she was personally\n\u201caware of [the defendant\u2019s] statement and engaged in a\nrelevant transaction . . . based on that specific misrepre\u00ad\nsentation.\u201d Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nIndividualized reliance issues would predominate in such\na lawsuit. See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242. The litigation,\ntherefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a\nclass action, but the initiating plaintiff \u2019s claim would\nremain live; it would not be \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d 660 F. 3d,\nat 1175.\n   A failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast,\nnot only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on\u00ad\nthe-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also\nestablishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot\nprevail on the merits of her Rule 10b\u20135 claim. Materiality\nthus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity pred\u00ad\nicates in this critical respect: While the failure of common,\nclasswide proof on the issues of market efficiency and\npublicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof\nof reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of\nmateriality ends the case for the class and for all indi\u00ad\nviduals alleged to compose the class. See Brief for United\n18   AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nStates as Amicus Curiae 20 (\u201cUnless the failure of com-\nmon proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof, it\ndoes not cast doubt on the propriety of class certifica\u00ad\ntion.\u201d). In short, there can be no actionable reliance,\nindividually or collectively, on immaterial information. Be-\ncause a failure of proof on the issue of materiality, unlike\nthe issues of market efficiency and publicity, does not give\nrise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming\ncommon ones, materiality need not be proved prior to Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification.\n                              2\n   Amgen also contends that certain \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d\nmilitate in favor of requiring precertification proof of\nmateriality. Brief for Petitioners 28. An order granting\nclass certification, Amgen observes, can exert substantial\npressure on a defendant \u201cto settle rather than incur the\ncosts of defending a class action and run the risk of poten\u00ad\ntially ruinous liability.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s 1998 Note\non subd.

Absent\na requirement to evaluate materiality at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never\nbe addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender\nand settle soon after a class is certified. Insistence on\nproof of materiality before certifying a securities-fraud\nclass action, Amgen thus urges, ensures that the issue\nwill be adjudicated and not forgone. See also post, at 4\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the same concerns).\n   In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from\nother essential elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim, notably,\nthe requirements that the statements or omissions on\nwhich the plaintiff \u2019s claims are based were false or mis\u00ad\nleading and that the alleged statements or omissions\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Settlement\npressure exerted by class certification may prevent judi\u00ad\ncial resolution of these issues. Yet this Court has held\nthat loss causation and the falsity or misleading nature of\nthe defendant\u2019s alleged statements or omissions are com\u00ad\nmon questions that need not be adjudicated before a class\nis certified. See Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3) (loss causation need not be proved at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage); Basic, 485 U.

In enacting the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n109 Stat. 737, Congress recognized that although private\nsecurities-fraud litigation furthers important public-policy\ninterests, prime among them, deterring wrongdoing and\nproviding restitution to defrauded investors, such law-\nsuits have also been subject to abuse, including the\n\u201cextract[ion]\u201d of \u201cextortionate \u2018settlements\u2019 \u201d of frivolous\nclaims. H. R. Conf. Rep.

Congress later fortified\nthe PSLRA by enacting the Securities Litigation Uniform\nStandards Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3227, which curtailed\nplaintiffs\u2019 ability to evade the PSLRA\u2019s limitations on\nfederal securities-fraud litigation by bringing class-action\nsuits under state rather than federal law. See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778bb(f)(1) (2006 ed.).\n   While taking these steps to curb abusive securities\u00ad\nfraud lawsuits, Congress rejected calls to undo the fraud\u00ad\non-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed\nin Basic. See Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 153, and n. 8\n(noting that the initial version of H. R. 10, 104th Cong.,\n1st Sess.

Nor did Congress decree that securities-fraud\nplaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtain\u00ad\ning class certification. Because Congress has homed in on\nthe precise policy concerns raised in Amgen\u2019s brief, \u201c[w]e\ndo not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its\nown further adjustments by reinterpreting Rule 23 to\nmake likely success on the merits essential to class certifi\u00ad\ncation in securities-fraud suits.\u201d Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at\n686; cf.

Amgen\u2019s argument, if embraced, would\nnecessitate a mini-trial on the issue of materiality at the\nclass-certification stage. Such preliminary adjudications\nwould entail considerable expenditures of judicial time\nand resources, costs scarcely anticipated by Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A), which instructs that the\ndecision whether to certify a class action be made \u201c[a]t an\nearly practicable time.\u201d If the class is certified, materiality\nmight have to be shown all over again at trial. And if\ncertification is denied for failure to prove materiality,\nnonnamed class members would not be bound by that\ndetermination. See Smith, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12\u201318). They would be free to renew the fray, perhaps\nin another forum, perhaps with a stronger showing of\nmateriality.\n   Given the tenuousness of Amgen\u2019s judicial-economy\nargument, Amgen\u2019s policy arguments ultimately return to\nthe contention that private securities-fraud actions should\nbe hemmed in to mitigate their potentially \u201cvexatiou[s]\u201d\ncharacter.

See post, at 1. Nevertheless, he maintains\nthat full satisfaction of Rule 23\u2019s requirements is insuffi\u00ad\ncient to obtain class certification under Basic. In JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s view, the Court\u2019s decision in Basic established a\nspecial rule: A securities-fraud class action cannot be\ncertified unless all of the prerequisites of the fraud-on-the\u00ad\nmarket presumption of reliance, including materiality,\nhave first been established.

The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the class certification but re\u00ad\nversed the grant of summary judgment. Id., at 229. This\nCourt, in turn, vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment\nand remanded for further proceedings on the defendants\u2019\nsummary-judgment motion in light of the materiality\nstandard set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion.

Instead, the Court expressly endorsed the\nDistrict Court\u2019s class-certification order while at the same\ntime recognizing that further proceedings were necessary\nto determine whether the plaintiffs had mustered suffi\u00ad\ncient evidence to satisfy the relatively lenient standard for\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Scouring the Court\u2019s decision in Basic for some semblance of support\n\nfor his position, JUSTICE SCALIA attaches portentous significance to\nBasic\u2019s statement that the District Court\u2019s class-certification order,\nalthough \u201c \u2018appropriate when made,\u2019 \u201d was \u201c \u2018subject on remand to such\nadjustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand[ed].\u2019 \u201d Post, at\n2 (quoting Basic, 485 U.

The\nCourt of Appeals concluded, and Amgen does not contest,\nthat Amgen\u2019s rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the\nmisrepresentations and omissions alleged in Connecticut\nRetirement\u2019s complaint were immaterial.           660 F. 3d,\nat 1177 (characterizing Amgen\u2019s rebuttal evidence as\nan attempt to present a \u201c \u2018truth-on-the-market\u2019 defense,\u201d\nwhich the Court of Appeals explained \u201cis a method of\nrefuting an alleged misrepresentation\u2019s materiality\u201d).

But again, as earlier explained, see supra, at\n10\u201313, individual reliance questions will not overwhelm\nquestions common to the class, for the class members\u2019\nclaims will have failed on their merits, thus bringing the\nlitigation to a close. Therefore, just as a plaintiff class\u2019s\ninability to prove materiality creates no risk that individ\u00ad\nual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebut\u00ad\ntal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the\npredominance of questions common to the class.\n   We recognized as much in Basic itself.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United\nStates Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it\nwas invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485\nU. S. 224 (1988). Today\u2019s Court applies to that rule the\nprinciples of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and\nthereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is\nestablished at the certification stage even when material-\nity has not been shown. That would be a correct procedure\nif Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the\nquestion of substantive liability\u2014what must be shown in\norder to prevail. If that were so, the new substantive rule,\nlike the more general substantive rule that reliance must\nbe proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to\nthe commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3). In my view,\nhowever, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market\u2014a well\nfunctioning market plus purchase or sale in the market\nplus material misrepresentation known to the market\nestablishes a necessary showing of reliance\u2014governs not\nonly the question of substantive liability, but also the\n2    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion whether certification is proper. All of the ele-\nments of that rule, including materiality, must be estab-\nlished if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.\nThe answer to the question before us today is to be found\nnot in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.\n   Basic established a presumption that the misrepresen-\ntation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the\nplaintiffs relied on the market price. And it established\nthat presumption not just for the question of substantive\nliability but also for the question of certification. \u201cWe\ngranted certiorari . . . to determine whether the courts\nbelow properly applied a presumption of reliance in certify-\ning the class, rather than requiring each class member to\nshow direct reliance on Basic\u2019s statements.\u201d 485 U. S., at\n230 (emphasis added). Of course it makes no sense to\n\u201cpresume reliance\u201d on the misrepresentation merely be-\ncause the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the\nalleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the\nmarket price\u2014that is, unless it was material. Thus, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot\nthrough with references to the necessary materiality. The\npresumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither\nsubstantive liability will attach nor will certification be\nproper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of\nmateriality for certification is demonstrated by the last\nsentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court\nhas decided to remand the case for reconsideration of\nmateriality under the appropriate legal standard: \u201cThe\nDistrict Court\u2019s certification of the class here was appro-\npriate when made but is subject on remand to such ad-\njustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.\u201d\nId., at 250. Those circumstances are the establishment of\nfacts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that\nshow the misrepresentation was not material, or was not\nknown to the market.\n   The Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

But review of the Basic certifi-\ncation order shows that the District Court\u2019s fraud-on-the-\nmarket analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings:\n\u201c[T]he allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are sufficient to\nbring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the\nso-called \u2018fraud on the market\u2019 theory.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013279,\np. 115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint\nparagraphs as establishing fraud on the market). Under a\npleadings standard, the District Court found that the\nplaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud\non the market, including its materiality predicate. See id.,\nat 133a (denial of reconsideration) (\u201cThis court ruled on\nDecember 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance]\ncould be established by the following: proof of a material\nmisrepresentation which affected the market price of the\nstocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).

It does an injustice to the Basic Court to presume\nwithout clear evidence\u2014and indeed in the face of language\nto the contrary\u2014that it was establishing a regime in\nwhich not only those market class-action suits that have\nearned the presumption of reliance pass beyond the cru-\ncial certification stage, but all market-purchase and\nmarket-sale class-action suits do so, no matter what the al-\nleged misrepresentation. The opinion need not be read\nthis way, and it should not.\n  The fraud-on-the-market theory approved by Basic en-\nvisions a demonstration of materiality not just for sub-\nstantive recovery but for certification.

The Court does so by all but eliminating\nmateriality as one of the predicates of the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory, which serves as an alternative mode of es-\ntablishing reliance. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S.\n224, 241\u2013250 (1988). Without demonstrating materiality\nat certification, plaintiffs cannot establish Basic\u2019s fraud-\non-the-market presumption. Without proof of fraud on the\nmarket, plaintiffs cannot show that otherwise individual-\nized questions of reliance will predominate, as required\nby Rule 23(b)(3). And without satisfying Rule 23(b)(3),\nclass certification is improper. Fraud on the market is\nthus a condition precedent to class certification, without\nwhich individualized questions of reliance will defeat\ncertification.\n   The Court\u2019s opinion depends on the following assump-\ntion: Plaintiffs will either (1) establish materiality at the\nmerits stage, in which case class certification was proper\n2       AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                        AND TRUST FUNDS\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecause reliance turned out to be a common question, or\n(2) fail to establish materiality, in which case the claim\nwould fail on the merits, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe class should not have been certified in the first place,\nbecause reliance was never a common question. The\nfailure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms\nthat fraud on the market was never established, that\nquestions regarding the element of reliance were not\ncommon under Rule 23(b)(3), and, by extension, that\ncertification was never proper. Plaintiffs cannot be ex-\ncused of their Rule 23 burden to show at certification that\nquestions of reliance are common merely because they\nmight lose later on the merits element of materiality.\nBecause a securities-fraud plaintiff invoking Basic\u2019s fraud-\non-the-market presumption to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) should\nbe required to prove each of the predicates of that theory\nat certification in order to demonstrate that questions of\nreliance are common to the class, I respectfully dissent.\n                             A\n  We begin with \u00a710 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, 15 U.

The materiality\nof a specific statement is, therefore, essential to the fraud-\non-the-market presumption, which in turn enables a\nplaintiff to prove reliance.\n                             B\n    Basic\u2019s fraud-on-the-market presumption is highly sig-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The United States as amicus curiae invokes Rule 23(a)(3) to suggest\n\nthat the third element, the timing of the relevant stock trades, is a\n\u201climit on the definition of the class.\u201d Brief for United States 15, n. 2.\nBut it is also necessary to establish the timing of the allegedly material,\npublic misstatement made into an allegedly efficient market (as well as\nwhen the fraud ended due to entry of truth on the market) before the\nfraud-on-the-market theory can be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3).\nThus, the lower court opinion in Basic expressly identified \u201cthe time the\nmisrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed\u201d as\npart of fraud on the market. Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750\n(CA6 1986). The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011), the Court cited the same language as\npart of the \u201cundisputed\u201d elements a securities-fraud plaintiff must\nprove to invoke Basic. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136) (quoting Basic,\nsupra, at 248, n. 27). Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and\ntruth is established at certification, there is no framework within which\nto determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common\nquestion. Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a\nfactor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n. 8, I agree. It\nwould be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3)\nand (4). It is equally important to establish the timing range at certifi-\ncation for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes. This fact undercuts the\nmajority\u2019s attempt to isolate materiality as the only factor of fraud on\nthe market that need not be shown at certification to demonstrate that\nreliance is a common question.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

See, e.g., Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2011)\n(slip op., at 11, n. 6) (\u201c[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certifi-\ncation must prove that their shares were traded on an ef-\nficient market,\u201d an element of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory (emphasis added)). Without that proof, there is\nno justification for certifying a class because there is no\n\u201c \u2018capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common\nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310) (quoting Nagareda, Class Certifi-\ncation in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.

Rev.\n97, 132 (2009)).\n    If plaintiffs fail to show that reliance is a common ques-\ntion at the time of certification, certification is improper.\nFor if reliance is not a common question, each plaintiff\nwould be required to prove that he in fact relied on a\nmisstatement, a showing which is simply not susceptible\nto classwide proof. Individuals make stock transactions\nfor divergent, even idiosyncratic, reasons. As the leading\npre-Basic fraud-on-the-market case recognized, \u201c[a] pur-\nchaser on the stock exchanges may be either unaware of a\nspecific false representation, or may not directly rely on it;\nhe may purchase because of a favorable price trend, price\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 There is no dispute that respondent meets the prerequisites of Fed.\n\nRule Civ.

Barrack,\n524 F. 2d 891, 907 (CA9 1975). The inquiry\u2019s inherently\nindividualized nature renders it impossible to generate the\ncommon answers necessary for certification under Rule\n23(b)(3). See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242 (\u201cRequiring proof of\nindividualized reliance from each member of the proposed\nplaintiff class effectively would have prevented respond-\nents from proceeding with a class action, since individual\nissues then would have overwhelmed the common ones\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s solution in Basic was to allow putative class\nmembers to prove reliance through the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. Id., at 241\u2013250. As the Court today\nrecognizes, failure to establish fraud on the market \u201cleaves\nopen the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both\nacknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the\npresumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-on-\nthe-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the\nmarket was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged\nmisstatement was public. See ante, at 16 (acknowledging\n\u201cthat market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities-\nfraud class action can be certified\u201d); 660 F. 3d 1170, 1175\n(CA9 2011) (same). See also Erica P. John Fund, 563\nU.

[and] that the stock traded in an efficient\nmarket\u201d). The Court is correct insofar as its statements\nrecognize that fraud on the market is a condition prece-\ndent to showing that there are common questions of reli-\nance at the time of class certification.\n   Nevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality\u2014by its\nown admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud\non the market\u2014need not be established at certification\nbecause it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

This assertion is an express admission\nthat parties will not know at certification whether reliance\nis an individual or common question.\n   To support its position, the Court transforms the predi-\ncate certification inquiry into a novel either-or inquiry\noccurring much later on the merits. According to the\nCourt, either (1) plaintiffs will prove materiality on the\nmerits, thus demonstrating ex post that common questions\npredominated at certification, or (2) they will fail to prove\nmateriality, at which point we learn ex post that certifica-\ntion was inappropriate because reliance was not, in fact, a\ncommon question. In the Court\u2019s second scenario, fraud\non the market was never established, reliance for each\nclass member was inherently individualized, and Rule\n23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.8\nThe Court suggests that the problem created by the second\nscenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose any-\nway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The majority ignores this explanation of the fundamental flaw in\n\nits position, asserting that I never \u201cexplain how . . . a plaintiff class\u2019s\nfailure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in\nindividual questions predominating over common ones.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nBut a plaintiff, who is excused from his burden of showing, at certifi-\ncation that reliance is a common question, fails to demonstrate that\ncommon questions predominate over the individualized questions of re-\nliance that are inherent in a securities fraud claim. A plaintiff must\ncarry this burden at certification for certification to be proper. The\nmajority does not respond to the inherent timing problem in its posi-\ntion. It does not explain how ignoring questions of reliance\u2014that\nundeniably will be individualized in some cases\u2014at certification is\njustified by the fact that those questions will be resolved months or\nyears later on the merits in a way that indicates reliance was indeed an\nindividualized question all along. Far from obeying the dictates of Rule\n23(b)(3) as it claims, ante, at 12\u201313, the majority unjustifiably puts off a\ncritical part of the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry until the merits. The only way\nthe majority can purport to follow Rule 23(b)(3) is by ignoring the fact\nthat, under its own analysis, reliance may be an individualized ques-\ntion that predominates over common questions at certification.\n10   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nover. See ante, at 17 (\u201c[F]ailure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality [at the merits stage] . . . not only precludes a\nplaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presump-\ntion of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of\nlaw that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her\nRule 10b\u20135 claim\u201d). But nothing in logic or precedent\njustifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is sus-\nceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because\none predicate of reliance\u2014materiality\u2014will be resolved, if\nat all, much later in the litigation on an independent\nmerits element.\n   It is the Court, not Amgen, that \u201cwould have us put the\ncart before the horse,\u201d ante, at 3, by jumping chronologi-\ncally to the \u00a710(b) merits element of materiality. But Rule\n23, as well as common sense, requires class certification\nissues to be addressed first. See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (\u201cAt an\nearly practicable time after a person sues or is sued . . .\nthe court must determine by order whether to certify the\naction as a class action\u201d). A plaintiff who cannot prove\nmateriality does not simply have a claim that is \u201c \u2018dead on\narrival\u2019 \u201d at the merits, ante, at 17 (quoting 660 F. 3d, at\n1175); he has a class that should never have arrived at the\nmerits at all because it failed Rule 23(b)(3) certification\nfrom the outset. Without materiality, there is no fraud-\non-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain\nindividualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossi-\nble. And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both\nfraud on the market at certification and an independent\nmerits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a\ncourt at certification may inquire into questions that also\nhave later relevance on the merits. See 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10\u201311). The Court reverses that inquiry,\neffectively saying that certification may be put off until\nlater because an adverse merits determination will retro-\nactively wipe out the entire class. However, a plaintiff\nwho cannot prove materiality cannot prove fraud on the\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 10 (\u201c[T]he piv-\notal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to\nensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\nclass will \u2018predominate\u2019 \u201d). The result is that the Court\neffectively equates \u00a710(b) materiality with fraud-on-the-\nmarket materiality and elides reliance as a \u00a710(b) ele-\nment. But a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23\nbears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements\nof a \u00a710(b) claim, which includes materiality and reliance.\nAs Wal-Mart explained, \u201c[a] party seeking class certifica-\ntion must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Of course, the Court\u2019s assertion that materiality will be resolved on\n\nthe merits presumes that certification will not bring in terrorem settle-\nment pressures to bear, foreclosing any materiality inquiry at all. The\nCourt dismisses this concern, ante, at 18\u201320, attempting to give fraud-\non-the-market analysis the imprimatur of congressional enactment\ninstead of recognizing it as a judicially created doctrine grafted onto an\nimplied cause of action. But the fact that Congress has enacted legisla-\ntion to curb excesses in securities litigation while leaving Basic intact,\nsee ante, at 19\u201320, says nothing about the proper interpretation of\nBasic at issue here. The Court retains discretion over the contours of\nBasic unless and until Congress sees fit to alter them\u2014a fact Congress\nmust also have realized when it passed the Private Securities Litiga-\ntion Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737, and other legislation. The\nCourt\u2019s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-\nthe-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that\nlater determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the\ncertitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is\ncorrect.\n12   AMGEN, INC. v.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIf the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at\ncertification, a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of\nestablishing that questions of individualized reliance will\nnot predominate, without which the plaintiff class cannot\nobtain certification. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (holding\nin Rule 23(a)(2) context that \u201c[w]ithout some glue hold-\ning the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it\nwill be impossible to say that examination of all the class\nmembers\u2019 claims for relief will produce a common an-\nswer\u201d). It is only by establishing all of the elements of the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption that reliance can be\nproved on a classwide basis. Therefore, if a plaintiff wishes\nto use Basic\u2019s presumption to prove that reliance is a\ncommon question, he must establish the entire presump-\ntion, including materiality, at the class certification stage.\n   Nor is it relevant, as respondent argues, that requiring\nplaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market\nat certification will make it more difficult to obtain certifi-\ncation. See Brief for Respondent 35\u201338. In Basic, four\nJustices of a six-Justice Court created the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption from a combination of newly minted\neconomic theories, 485 U. S., at 250\u2013251, n. 1 (White, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and \u201cconsidera-\ntions of fairness, public policy, and probability,\u201d id., at 245\n(majority opinion), to allow claims that otherwise would\nhave been barred due to the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to show\nreliance, id., at 242. Basic is a judicially invented doctrine\nbased on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden\non plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of\naction. There is nothing untoward about requiring plain-\ntiffs to take the steps that the Basic Court created in an\neffort to save otherwise inadequate claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Its shortcomings are further highlighted by\nthe role that materiality played in the pre-Basic develop-\nment of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition\nprecedent to showing that there are common questions of\nreliance in the class-action context. Materiality, at the\ntime of certification, has been a driving force behind\nthe theory from the outset. This fact further supports the\nneed to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory is invoked to show that questions of reli-\nance can be answered on a classwide basis.\n                              A\n   Before Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts\napplying the fraud-on-the-market theory. Both demon-\nstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not\na mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons\nfor allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed\naside at certification. This fact weighs strongly in favor of\nthe conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certi-\nfication when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is\ninvoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide\nbasis.\n   The first signpost was the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 1975 opinion\nin Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the \u201cseminal\nfraud on the market case.\u201d Peil, 806 F. 2d, at 1163, n. 16.\nSee also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cThe earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory\ncited by the Court is Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891\n(CA9 1975), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 816 (1976)\u201d).\n   Blackie arose from a $90 million loss reported by audio\nequipment manufacturer Ampex Corp. in its 1972 annual\nreport. 524 F. 2d, at 894.10 Ampex\u2019s independent auditors\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 10 Ampex\u2019s   sales for 1971 were just under $284 million.

In resultant class ac-\ntions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the\nway of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it\nwas not a common question.\n   The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Instead, it relieved plain-\ntiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, ex-\nplaining that \u201ccausation is adequately established in the\nimpersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and\nof the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof\nof reliance.\u201d Id., at 906 (emphasis added). The court left\nno doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall\nin Ampex\u2019s financial statements was central to its deter-\nmination that reliance could be presumed. It asserted\nthat \u201c[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reli-\nance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the\nstock price\u2014when the purchase is made[,] the causational\nchain between defendant\u2019s conduct and plaintiff \u2019s loss is\nsufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.\u201d\nIbid. Materiality was not merely an important factor that\nallowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiali-\nty was the factor. It demonstrated that the defendants\nhad committed a fraud on the market, that all putative\nclass plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and,\ntherefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible\nto common answers.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA. & P.

See Note, The Fraud-on-the-Market\nTheory, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1143 (1982) (hereinafter Harv.\nL. Rev. Note). The Sixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic\ntermed the Note \u201c[t]he clearest statement of the theory of\npresumption of reliance.\u201d Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d\n741, 750 (1986). Indeed, in the briefing for Basic itself,\nthe plaintiffs, the United States, and plaintiffs\u2019 amicus cited\nthe article repeatedly as an authoritative statement on the\nsubject. See Brief for Respondent 43, n. 18, 46, n. 20 (cited\nin Peil, supra, at 1160), Brief for Securities and Exchange\nCommission as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 25, 24, n. 30, 26, n.\n32, and Brief for Joseph Harris et al. as Amicus Curiae 4,\nn. 2, in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013279.\n   Like Blackie, the Note also hinged the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption of reliance on proof of materiality.\nHarv. L. Rev. Note 1161 (\u201cIn developed markets, which\nare apparently efficient, reliance should be presumed from\nthe materiality of the deception\u201d (emphasis added)). Ulti-\nmately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who\nhas read Basic, the Note formulated a \u201cpivotal assump-\ntion\u201d underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the\nbelief that:\n     \u201cmarket prices respond to information disseminated\n     (or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose\n     securities are traded.

Our holding is no more than an\nextension of Blackie\u201d).\n16    AMGEN, INC. v.

L. Rev. Note\n     1154 (footnote omitted).\n  Again, the materiality of the alleged misstatement was\na key component, without which the market could not be\npresumed to move. As a result, without materiality it is\nimpossible to say that there has been a fraud on the mar-\nket at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to\nbelieve that the market price at which stock transactions\noccurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by\nextension, that any market participants relied on it.\nMateriality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption is invoked, or there is no common-\nality with respect to questions of reliance.\n                              B\n   Nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the\nSixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic. Rather, the court\nfollowed the path marked by the signposts discussed\nabove. It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evi-\ndence of reliance, so long as \u201ca defendant is shown to have\nmade a material public misrepresentation that, if relied\non directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to mis-\njudge the value of the stock.\u201d Levinson, 786 F. 2d, at 750\n(emphasis added). The court\u2019s analysis made clear that\nmateriality should be demonstrated at the time the pre-\nsumption was invoked: \u201cIn order to invoke the presump-\ntion of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,\na plaintiff must allege and prove . . . that the mis-\nrepresentations were material . . . .\u201d Ibid. (citing Blackie,\n524 F. 2d, at 906).\n                            C\n  Finally, the briefing before this Court in Basic itself\nbuilt upon this framework and the foundational principle\nthat materiality is an integral part of the theory.

S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncally, the Basic defendants argued that the plaintiffs could\nnot establish fraud on the market at certification even if\nthe theory were valid because the alleged misstatement\nwas immaterial. They \u201ccontrast[ed] the likely market\nimpact of disclosure of the [$90 million Blackie loss] . . .\nwith the disclosure of the information which respondents\ncontend[ed] rendered Basic\u2019s statements materially mis-\nleading.\u201d See Brief for Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013\n279, p. 42. The Basic defendants concluded that \u201cthe\ndifferences between a company\u2019s $90 million loss and a\ncompany\u2019s sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are sub-\nstantial. . . . [T]he fraud on the market theory, if it has\nvitality, should not be applied in a case such as this.\u201d Id.,\nat 43.\n   In response, the plaintiffs in Basic did not argue that\nthe defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory. They instead advanced a\nnow-foreclosed interpretation of dicta from Eisen v. Car-\nlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974):\n    \u201cPetitioners\u2019 final argument\u2014that respondents will be\n    unable to establish that Basic\u2019s repeated false and\n    misleading statements impacted the price of Basic\n    stock over a fourteen month period\u2014represents an ef-\n    fort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for\n    class certification. . . . As this Court held in Eisen v.\n    Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974): \u2018We\n    find nothing in either the language or history of Rule\n    23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a pre-\n    liminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to\n    determine whether it may be maintained as a class\n    action.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013\n    279, p. 54.\n  The Court rejected this reading of Eisen two Terms ago,\nexplaining that the very language the Basic plaintiffs\nquoted was \u201csometimes mistakenly cited\u201d as prohibiting\n18    AMGEN, INC. v.

The Basic defendants\u2019 reply is con-\nsistent with Wal-Mart:\n     \u201cPutative class representatives, such as respondents,\n     should not be permitted to invoke the fraud on the\n     market theory while, at the same time, arguing that\n     courts may not make any preliminary inquiry into the\n     claimed impact on the market. See, e.g., Resp. Br.,\n     p. 54. By seeking the benefit of the presumption, re-\n     spondents necessarily invite judicial scrutiny of the\n     circumstances in which it is invoked.\u201d Reply Brief for\n     Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013279, p. 18.\n   Well said. The history of Basic is worth the volume of\nargument offered by the majority. Cf. New York Trust Co.\nv. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (majority opinion of\nHolmes, J.). Materiality was central to the development,\nanalysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market theory\nboth before Basic and in Basic itself. Materiality, there-\nfore, must be demonstrated to prove fraud on the market,\nand until materiality of an alleged misstatement is shown\nthere is no reason to believe that all market participants\nhave relied equally on it. Otherwise individualized ques-\ntions of reliance remain. This history confirms that mate-\nriality must be proved at the time that the theory is\ninvoked\u2014i.e., at certification.\n                             III\n  I, thus, would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit\nand hold that a plaintiff invoking the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption bears the burden to establish all the ele-\nments of fraud on the market at certification, including\nthe materiality of the alleged misstatement.\n",

CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT\n          PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11\u20131085. Argued November 5, 2012\u2014Decided February 27, 2013\nTo recover damages in a private securities-fraud action under \u00a710(b) of\n  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange\n  Commission Rule 10b\u20135, a plaintiff must prove, among other things,\n  reliance on a material misrepresentation or omission made by the de-\n  fendant. Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___, ___.\n  Requiring proof of direct reliance \u201cwould place an unnecessarily un-\n  realistic evidentiary burden on [a] plaintiff who has traded on an im-\n  personal market.\u201d Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224, 245. Thus,\n  this Court has endorsed a \u201cfraud-on-the-market\u201d theory, which per-\n  mits securities-fraud plaintiffs to invoke a rebuttable presumption of\n  reliance on public, material misrepresentations regarding securities\n  traded in an efficient market. Id., at 241\u2013249. The fraud-on-the-\n  market theory facilitates the certification of securities-fraud class ac-\n  tions by permitting reliance to be proved on a classwide basis.\n     Invoking the fraud-on-the-market theory, respondent Connecticut\n  Retirement Plans and Trust Funds (Connecticut Retirement) sought\n  certification of a securities-fraud class action under Federal Rule of\n  Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) against biotechnology company Amgen Inc.\n  and several of its officers (collectively, Amgen). The District Court\n  certified the class, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit\n  rejected Amgen\u2019s argument that Connecticut Retirement was re-\n  quired to prove the materiality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresenta-\n  tions and omissions before class certification in order to satisfy Rule\n  23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class\n  members predominate over any questions affecting only individual\n  members.\u201d The Ninth Circuit also held that the District Court did\n  not err in refusing to consider rebuttal evidence that Amgen had pre-\n2       AMGEN, INC. v.

Pp. 9\u201326.\n    (a) The pivotal inquiry in this case is whether proof of materiality\n is needed to ensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\n class will \u201cpredominate over any questions affecting only individual\n members\u201d as the litigation progresses. For two reasons, the answer\n to this question is \u201cno.\u201d First, because materiality is judged accord-\n ing to an objective standard, it can be proved through evidence com-\n mon to the class. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S.\n 438, 445. Thus, it is a common question for Rule 23(b)(3) purposes.\n Second, a failure of proof on the common question of materiality\n would not result in individual questions predominating. Instead, it\n would end the case, for materiality is an essential element of a secu-\n rities-fraud claim. Pp. 9\u201314.\n    (b) Amgen\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 14\u2013\n 24.\n      (1) Amgen points to the Court\u2019s statement in Erica P. John\n Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U. S. ___, ___, that \u201csecurities\n fraud plaintiffs must prove certain things in order to invoke Basic\u2019s\n rebuttable presumption of reliance,\u201d including \u201cthat the alleged mis-\n representations were publicly known . . . , that the stock traded in an\n efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place \u2018be-\n tween the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the\n truth was revealed.\u2019 \u201d If these fraud-on-the-market predicates must\n be proved before class certification, Amgen contends, materiality\u2014\n another fraud-on-the-market predicate\u2014should be treated no differ-\n ently. The Court disagrees. The requirement that a putative class\n representative establish that it executed trades \u201cbetween the time\n the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was re-\n vealed\u201d relates primarily to the Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) inquiries into\n typicality and adequacy of representation, not to the Rule 23(b)(3)\n predominance inquiry. And unlike materiality, market efficiency and\n the public nature of the alleged misrepresentations are not indispen-\n sable elements of a Rule 10\u20135 claim. While the failure of common,\n classwide proof of market efficiency or publicity leaves open the pro-\n spect of individualized proof of reliance, the failure of common proof\n on the issue of materiality ends the case for all class members.\n Pp. 15\u201318.\n      (2) Amgen also contends that \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d militate in\n favor of requiring precertification proof of materiality. Because class\n certification can exert substantial pressure on the defendant to settle\n rather than risk ruinous liability, Amgen asserts, materiality may\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  never be addressed by a court if it is not required to be evaluated at\n  the class-certification stage. In this regard, however, materiality\n  does not differ from other essential elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim,\n  notably, the requirements that the statements or omissions on which\n  the plaintiff \u2019s claims are based were false or misleading and that the\n  alleged statements or omissions caused the plaintiff to suffer econom-\n  ic loss. Significantly, while addressing the settlement pressures as-\n  sociated with securities-fraud class actions, Congress has rejected\n  calls to undo the fraud-on-the-market theory. And contrary to\n  Amgen\u2019s argument that requiring proof of materiality before class\n  certification would conserve judicial resources, Amgen\u2019s position\n  would necessitate time and resource intensive mini-trials on materi-\n  ality at the class-certification stage. Pp. 18\u201322.\n     (c) Also unavailing is Amgen\u2019s claim that the District Court erred\n  by refusing to consider the rebuttal evidence Amgen proffered in op-\n  posing Connecticut Retirement\u2019s class-certification motion. The\n  Ninth Circuit concluded, and Amgen does not contest, that Amgen\u2019s\n  rebuttal evidence aimed to prove that the misrepresentations and\n  omissions alleged in Connecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint were imma-\n  terial. The potential immateriality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresen-\n  tations and omissions, however, is no barrier to finding that common\n  questions predominate. Just as a plaintiff class\u2019s inability to prove\n  materiality creates no risk that individual questions will predomi-\n  nate, a definitive rebuttal on the issue of materiality would not un-\n  dermine the predominance of questions common to the class.

Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988), and recog-\nnized most recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011). The fraud-on-the-market\npremise is that the price of a security traded in an efficient\nmarket will reflect all publicly available information about\na company; accordingly, a buyer of the security may be\npresumed to have relied on that information in purchasing\nthe security.\n   Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for\nthe securities at issue and has not contested the public\ncharacter of the allegedly fraudulent statements on which\nConnecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint is based. Nor does\nAmgen here dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets\n2     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23(a):\n(1) the alleged class \u201cis so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable\u201d; (2) \u201cthere are questions of law\nor fact common to the class\u201d; (3) Connecticut Retirement\u2019s\nclaims are \u201ctypical of the claims . . . of the class\u201d; and (4)\nConnecticut Retirement will \u201cfairly and adequately protect\nthe interests of the class.\u201d\n  The issue presented concerns the requirement stated in\nRule 23(b)(3) that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to\nclass members predominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members.\u201d Amgen contends that to meet\nthe predominance requirement, Connecticut Retirement\nmust do more than plausibly plead that Amgen\u2019s alleged\nmisrepresentations and misleading omissions materially\naffected Amgen\u2019s stock price. According to Amgen, certifi\u00ad\ncation must be denied unless Connecticut Retirement\nproves materiality, for immaterial misrepresentations or\nomissions, by definition, would have no impact on Amgen\u2019s\nstock price in an efficient market.\n  While Connecticut Retirement certainly must prove\nmateriality to prevail on the merits, we hold that such\nproof is not a prerequisite to class certification. Rule\n23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions common to the\nclass predominate, not that those questions will be an\u00ad\nswered, on the merits, in favor of the class. Because mate\u00ad\nriality is judged according to an objective standard, the\nmateriality of Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and\nomissions is a question common to all members of the\nclass Connecticut Retirement would represent. The al\u00ad\nleged misrepresentations and omissions, whether material\nor immaterial, would be so equally for all investors com\u00ad\nposing the class. As vital, the plaintiff class\u2019s inability to\nprove materiality would not result in individual questions\npredominating. Instead, a failure of proof on the issue\nof materiality would end the case, given that materiality\nis an essential element of the class members\u2019 securities\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In no\nevent will the individual circumstances of particular class\nmembers bear on the inquiry.\n   Essentially, Amgen, also the dissenters from today\u2019s\ndecision, would have us put the cart before the horse. To\ngain certification under Rule 23(b)(3), Amgen and the\ndissenters urge, Connecticut Retirement must first estab\u00ad\nlish that it will win the fray. But the office of a Rule\n23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case;\nrather, it is to select the \u201cmetho[d]\u201d best suited to adjudi\u00ad\ncation of the controversy \u201cfairly and efficiently.\u201d\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   This case involves the interaction between federal\nsecurities-fraud laws and Rule 23\u2019s requirements for\nclass certification. To obtain certification of a class ac-\ntion for money damages under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff\nmust satisfy Rule 23(a)\u2019s above-mentioned prerequisites\nof numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of\nrepresentation, see supra, at 1\u20132, and must also establish\nthat \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class mem\u00ad\nbers predominate over any questions affecting only indi\u00ad\nvidual members, and that a class action is superior to\nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudi\u00ad\ncating the controversy.\u201d To recover damages in a private\nsecurities-fraud action under \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15\nU.

Id., at 241\u2013249.1\n   The fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise\nthat certain well developed markets are efficient proces\u00ad\nsors of public information.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwould mean that market prices were not efficiently incor\u00ad\nporating the full supply of public information. See R.\nBrealey, S. Myers, & F. Allen, Principles of Corporate\nFinance 330 (10th ed. 2011) (\u201c[I]n an efficient market,\nthere is no way for most investors to achieve consistently\nsuperior rates of return.\u201d).\n  In Basic, we held that if a market is shown to be effi\u00ad\ncient, courts may presume that investors who traded\nsecurities in that market relied on public, material mis\u00ad\nrepresentations regarding those securities. See 485 U. S.,\nat 245\u2013247. This presumption springs from the very\nconcept of market efficiency. If a market is generally\nefficient in incorporating publicly available information\ninto a security\u2019s market price, it is reasonable to presume\nthat a particular public, material misrepresentation will\nbe reflected in the security\u2019s price. Furthermore, it is\nreasonable to presume that most investors\u2014knowing that\nthey have little hope of outperforming the market in the\nlong run based solely on their analysis of publicly availa\u00ad\nble information\u2014will rely on the security\u2019s market price as\nan unbiased assessment of the security\u2019s value in light of\nall public information. Thus, courts may presume that\ninvestors trading in efficient markets indirectly rely on\npublic, material misrepresentations through their \u201creli\u00ad\nance on the integrity of the price set by the market.\u201d Id.,\nat 245. \u201c[T]he presumption,\u201d however, is \u201cjust that, and\n[can] be rebutted by appropriate evidence.\u201d Halliburton,\n563 U.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242.

After\ngranting Amgen\u2019s request to take an interlocutory appeal\nfrom the District Court\u2019s class-certification order, see Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 23(f), the Court of Appeals affirmed. See\n660 F. 3d 1170 (CA9 2011).\n   Amgen raised two arguments on appeal. First, Amgen\ncontended that the District Court erred by certifying the\nproposed class without first requiring Connecticut Retire\u00ad\nment to prove that Amgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations\nand omissions were material. Second, Amgen argued that\nthe District Court erred by refusing to consider certain\nrebuttal evidence that Amgen had proffered in opposition\nto Connecticut Retirement\u2019s class-certification motion.\nThis evidence, in Amgen\u2019s view, demonstrated that the\nmarket was well aware of the truth regarding its alleged\nmisrepresentations and omissions at the time the class\nmembers purchased their shares.\n   The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions.\nAmgen\u2019s first argument, the Court of Appeals noted, made\nthe uncontroversial point that immaterial misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions and omissions \u201cby definition [do] not affect . . . stock\nprice[s] in an efficient market.\u201d Id., at 1175. Thus,\nwhere misrepresentations and omissions are not material,\nthere is no basis for presuming classwide reliance on\nthose misrepresentations and omissions through the\ninformation-processing mechanism of the market price.\n\u201cThe problem with that argument,\u201d the Court of Appeals ob\u00ad\nserved, is evident: \u201c[B]ecause materiality is an element of\n8    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nthe merits of their securities fraud claim, the plaintiffs\ncannot both fail to prove materiality yet still have a viable\nclaim for which they would need to prove reliance individ\u00ad\nually.\u201d Ibid. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that\n\u201cproof of materiality is not necessary\u201d to ensure compli\u00ad\nance with Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirement that common ques\u00ad\ntions predominate. Id., at 1177.\n   With respect to Amgen\u2019s second argument, the Court of\nAppeals determined that Amgen\u2019s proffered rebuttal\nevidence was merely \u201ca method of refuting [the] materi-\nality\u201d of the misrepresentations and omissions alleged\nin Connecticut Retirement\u2019s complaint. Ibid. Having al-\nready concluded that a securities-fraud plaintiff does not\nneed to prove materiality before class certification, the\ncourt similarly held that \u201cthe district court correctly re\u00ad\nfused to consider\u201d Amgen\u2019s rebuttal evidence \u201cat the class\ncertification stage.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted Amgen\u2019s petition for certiorari, 567 U.

See Basic, 485 U. S., at\n247 (\u201c[W]here materially misleading statements have been\ndisseminated into an impersonal, well-developed market\n10    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor securities, the reliance of individual plaintiffs on the\nintegrity of the market price may be presumed.\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). That theory, Amgen correctly observes, is prem\u00ad\nised on the understanding that in an efficient market,\nall publicly available information is rapidly incorporated\ninto, and thus transmitted to investors through, the mar\u00ad\nket price. See id., at 246\u2013247. Because immaterial in-\nformation, by definition, does not affect market price,\nit cannot be relied upon indirectly by investors who, as\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory presumes, rely on the mar\u00ad\nket price\u2019s integrity. Therefore, the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory cannot apply absent a material misrepresentation\nor omission. And without the fraud-on-the-market theory,\nthe element of reliance cannot be proved on a classwide\nbasis through evidence common to the class. See id., at\n242. It thus follows, Amgen contends, that materiality\nmust be proved before a securities-fraud class action can\nbe certified.\n   Contrary to Amgen\u2019s argument, the key question in this\ncase is not whether materiality is an essential predicate of\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory; indisputably it is.4 In\u00ad\nstead, the pivotal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is\nneeded to ensure that the questions of law or fact common\nto the class will \u201cpredominate over any questions affecting\nonly individual members\u201d as the litigation progresses.\nFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3). For two reasons, the answer\nto this question is clearly \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 We agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that \u201c[m]ateriality was central to\n\nthe development, analysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory both before Basic and in Basic itself.\u201d Post, at 18. We disagree,\nhowever, that the history of the fraud-on-the-market theory\u2019s develop\u00ad\nment \u201cconfirms that materiality must be proved at the time that the\ntheory is invoked\u2014i.e., at certification.\u201d Ibid. As explained below, see\ninfra this page and 11\u201313, proof of materiality is not required prior to\nclass certification because such proof is not necessary to ensure satis\u00ad\nfaction of Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   First, because \u201c[t]he question of materiality . . . is an\nobjective one, involving the significance of an omitted or\nmisrepresented fact to a reasonable investor,\u201d materiality\ncan be proved through evidence common to the class. TSC\nIndustries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 445\n(1976). Consequently, materiality is a \u201ccommon ques\u00ad\ntio[n]\u201d for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3). Basic, 485 U. S., at\n242 (listing \u201cmateriality\u201d as one of the questions common\nto the Basic class members).\n   Second, there is no risk whatever that a failure of proof\non the common question of materiality will result in indi\u00ad\nvidual questions predominating. Because materiality is\nan essential element of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim, see Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), Connecticut\nRetirement\u2019s failure to present sufficient evidence of mate\u00ad\nriality to defeat a summary-judgment motion or to prevail\nat trial would not cause individual reliance questions to\noverwhelm the questions common to the class. Instead,\nthe failure of proof on the element of materiality would\nend the case for one and for all; no claim would re\u00ad\nmain in which individual reliance issues could potentially\npredominate.\n   Totally misapprehending our essential point, JUSTICE\nTHOMAS\u2019 dissent asserts that our \u201centire argument is\nbased on the assumption that the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits.\u201d Post, at 11, n. 9. Our\nposition is not so based. We rest, instead, entirely on the\ntext of Rule 23(b)(3), which provides for class certification\nif \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual\nmembers.\u201d A failure of proof on the common question of\nmateriality ends the litigation and thus will never cause\nindividual questions of reliance or anything else to over\u00ad\nwhelm questions common to the class. Therefore, under\nthe plain language of Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs are not\n12    AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequired to prove materiality at the class-certification\nstage. In other words, they need not, at that threshold,\nprove that the predominating question will be answered in\ntheir favor.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS urges that a plaintiff seeking class\ncertification \u201cmust show that the elements of [her] claim\nare susceptible to classwide proof.\u201d Post, at 7. See also\npost, at 11 (criticizing the Court for failing to focus its\nanalysis on \u201cwhether the element of reliance is susceptible\nto classwide proof \u201d). From this premise, JUSTICE THOMAS\nconcludes that Rule 10b\u20135 plaintiffs must prove material-\nity before class certification because (1) \u201cmateriality is a\nnecessary component of fraud on the market,\u201d and (2)\nwithout fraud on the market, the Rule 10b\u20135 element of\nreliance is not \u201csusceptible of a classwide answer.\u201d Post,\nat 6, 10\u201311. See also post, at 12 (\u201c[I]f a plaintiff wishes to\nuse Basic\u2019s presumption to prove that reliance is a com\u00ad\nmon question, he must establish the entire presumption,\nincluding materiality, at the class certification stage.\u201d).\n   Rule 23(b)(3), however, does not require a plaintiff\nseeking class certification to prove that each \u201celemen[t] of\n[her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof.\u201d Post, at 7.\nWhat the rule does require is that common questions\n\u201cpredominate over any questions affecting only individual\n[class] members.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3) (emphasis\nadded). Nowhere does JUSTICE THOMAS explain how, in\nan action invoking the Basic presumption, a plaintiff\nclass\u2019s failure to prove an essential element of its claim for\nrelief will result in individual questions predominating\nover common ones. Absent proof of materiality, the claim\nof the Rule 10b\u20135 class will fail in its entirety; there will\nbe no remaining individual questions to adjudicate.\n   Consequently, proof of materiality is not required to\nestablish that a proposed class is \u201csufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication by representation\u201d\u2014the focus of\nthe predominance inquiry under Rule 23(b)(3).

No\ndoubt a clever mind could conjure up fantastic scenarios in\nwhich an individual investor might rely on immaterial\ninformation (think of the superstitious investor who sells\nher securities based on a CEO\u2019s statement that a black cat\ncrossed the CEO\u2019s path that morning). But such objectively\nunreasonable reliance does not give rise to a Rule 10b\u20135\nclaim. See TSC Industries, 426 U. S., at 445 (materiality\nis judged by an objective standard). Thus, \u201cthe individual\u00ad\nized questions of reliance,\u201d post, at 9, n. 8, that hypotheti\u00ad\ncally might arise when a failure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality dooms the fraud-on-the-market class are far\nmore imaginative than real. Such \u201cindividualized ques\u00ad\ntions\u201d do not undermine class cohesion and thus cannot be\nsaid to \u201cpredominate\u201d for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).5\n   Because the question of materiality is common to the\nclass, and because a failure of proof on that issue would\nnot result in questions \u201caffecting only individual members\u201d\npredominating, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(3), Connecticut\nRetirement was not required to prove the materiality of\nAmgen\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the\nclass-certification stage. This is not a case in which the\nasserted problem\u2014i.e., that the plaintiff class cannot\nprove materiality\u2014\u201cexhibits some fatal dissimilarity\u201d\namong class members that would make use of the class\u00ad\naction device inefficient or unfair.

L. Rev. 151, 167).\nInstead, this research suggests, differences in efficiency can exist\nwithin a single market. For example, a market may more readily\nprocess certain forms of widely disseminated and easily digestible\ninformation, such as public merger announcements, than information\nmore difficult to acquire and understand, such as obscure technical\ndata buried in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSee, e.g., Macey & Miller, Good Finance, Bad Economics: An Analysis of\nthe Fraud-on-the-Market Theory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 1059, 1083\u20131087\n(1990); Stout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency: An Introduction\nto the New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 653\u2013656 (2003). Amgen,\nhowever, never clearly explains how this research on market efficiency\nbolsters its argument that courts should require precertification proof\nof materiality. In any event, this case is a poor vehicle for exploring\nwhatever implications the research Amgen cites may have for the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption recognized in Basic. As noted above,\nsee supra, at 6\u20137, Amgen conceded in its answer that the market for its\nsecurities is \u201cefficient\u201d and thus \u201cpromptly digest[s] current information\nregarding Amgen from all publicly available sources and reflect[s] such\ninformation in Amgen\u2019s stock price.\u201d Consolidated Amended Class\nAction Complaint \u00b6\u00b6199\u2013200; Answer \u00b6\u00b6199\u2013200.

Basic, 485 U. S., at 248, n. 27.7 A\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nefficient). Amgen remains bound by that concession. See American\nTitle Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., 861 F. 2d 224, 226 (CA9 1988) (\u201cFactual\nassertions in pleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are\nconsidered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who\nmade them.\u201d); cf.

We thus find nothing in the cited research\nthat would support requiring precertification proof of materiality in this\ncase.\n   7 As earlier noted, see supra, at 1\u20132, Amgen does not here contest\n16     AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurity\u2019s market price cannot be affected by a misrepre\u00ad\nsentation not yet made, and in an efficient market, a\nmisrepresentation\u2019s impact on market price is quickly\nnullified once the truth comes to light. Thus, a plaintiff\nwhose relevant transactions were not executed between\nthe time the misrepresentation was made and the time the\ntruth was revealed cannot be said to have indirectly relied\non the misrepresentation through its reliance on the in\u00ad\ntegrity of the market price.8 Such a plaintiff \u2019s claims,\ntherefore, would not be \u201ctypical\u201d of the claims of investors\nwho did trade during the window between misrepresenta\u00ad\ntion and truth revelation. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(3).\nNor could a court confidently conclude that such a plaintiff\nwould \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests\u201d of\ninvestors who traded during the relevant window. Rule\n23(a)(4). The requirement that the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory\u2019s trade-timing predicate be established before\nclass certification thus sheds little light on the question\nwhether materiality must also be proved at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage.\n   Amgen is not aided by Halliburton\u2019s statement that\nmarket efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities\u00ad\nfraud class action can be certified. As Amgen notes, mar\u00ad\nket efficiency, publicity, and materiality can all be proved\non a classwide basis. Furthermore, they are all essential\npredicates of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Unless\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nConnecticut Retirement\u2019s satisfaction of Rule 23(a)\u2019s requirements.\n  8 Accordingly, \u201cthe timing of the relevant stock trades\u201d is indeed an\n\n\u201celement\u201d of the fraud-on-the-market theory. Post, at 6, n. 6 (opinion of\nTHOMAS, J.). Unlike JUSTICE THOMAS, however, see ibid., we do not\nunderstand the United States as amicus curiae to take a different view.\nSee Brief for United States 15, n. 2 (\u201cPrecise identification of the times\nwhen the alleged misrepresentation was made and the truth was\nsubsequently revealed is . . . important to ensure that the named\nplaintiff has traded stock during the time the stock price allegedly was\ndistorted by the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations.\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthose predicates are established, there is no basis for\npresuming that the defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresenta\u00ad\ntions were reflected in the security\u2019s market price, and\nhence no grounding for any contention that investors\nindirectly relied on those misrepresentations through their\nreliance on the integrity of the market price. But unlike\nmateriality, market efficiency and publicity are not indis\u00ad\npensable elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim. See Matrixx\nInitiatives, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (listing ele\u00ad\nments of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim). Thus, where the market for\na security is inefficient or the defendant\u2019s alleged misrep\u00ad\nresentations were not aired publicly, a plaintiff cannot\ninvoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption. She can,\nhowever, attempt to establish reliance through the \u201ctradi\u00ad\ntional\u201d mode of demonstrating that she was personally\n\u201caware of [the defendant\u2019s] statement and engaged in a\nrelevant transaction . . . based on that specific misrepre\u00ad\nsentation.\u201d Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nIndividualized reliance issues would predominate in such\na lawsuit. See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242. The litigation,\ntherefore, could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) as a\nclass action, but the initiating plaintiff \u2019s claim would\nremain live; it would not be \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d 660 F. 3d,\nat 1175.\n   A failure of proof on the issue of materiality, in contrast,\nnot only precludes a plaintiff from invoking the fraud-on\u00ad\nthe-market presumption of classwide reliance; it also\nestablishes as a matter of law that the plaintiff cannot\nprevail on the merits of her Rule 10b\u20135 claim. Materiality\nthus differs from the market-efficiency and publicity pred\u00ad\nicates in this critical respect: While the failure of common,\nclasswide proof on the issues of market efficiency and\npublicity leaves open the prospect of individualized proof\nof reliance, the failure of common proof on the issue of\nmateriality ends the case for the class and for all indi\u00ad\nviduals alleged to compose the class. See Brief for United\n18   AMGEN INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                    AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nStates as Amicus Curiae 20 (\u201cUnless the failure of com-\nmon proof gives rise to a need for individualized proof, it\ndoes not cast doubt on the propriety of class certifica\u00ad\ntion.\u201d). In short, there can be no actionable reliance,\nindividually or collectively, on immaterial information. Be-\ncause a failure of proof on the issue of materiality, unlike\nthe issues of market efficiency and publicity, does not give\nrise to any prospect of individual questions overwhelming\ncommon ones, materiality need not be proved prior to Rule\n23(b)(3) class certification.\n                              2\n   Amgen also contends that certain \u201cpolicy considerations\u201d\nmilitate in favor of requiring precertification proof of\nmateriality. Brief for Petitioners 28. An order granting\nclass certification, Amgen observes, can exert substantial\npressure on a defendant \u201cto settle rather than incur the\ncosts of defending a class action and run the risk of poten\u00ad\ntially ruinous liability.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s 1998 Note\non subd.

Absent\na requirement to evaluate materiality at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage, Amgen contends, the issue may never\nbe addressed by a court, for the defendant will surrender\nand settle soon after a class is certified. Insistence on\nproof of materiality before certifying a securities-fraud\nclass action, Amgen thus urges, ensures that the issue\nwill be adjudicated and not forgone. See also post, at 4\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (expressing the same concerns).\n   In this regard, however, materiality does not differ from\nother essential elements of a Rule 10b\u20135 claim, notably,\nthe requirements that the statements or omissions on\nwhich the plaintiff \u2019s claims are based were false or mis\u00ad\nleading and that the alleged statements or omissions\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Settlement\npressure exerted by class certification may prevent judi\u00ad\ncial resolution of these issues. Yet this Court has held\nthat loss causation and the falsity or misleading nature of\nthe defendant\u2019s alleged statements or omissions are com\u00ad\nmon questions that need not be adjudicated before a class\nis certified. See Halliburton, 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3) (loss causation need not be proved at the class\u00ad\ncertification stage); Basic, 485 U.

See also\nSchleicher, 618 F. 3d, at 685 (falsity of alleged mis-\nstatements need not be proved before certification of a\nsecurities-fraud class action).\n   Congress, we count it significant, has addressed the\nsettlement pressures associated with securities-fraud class\nactions through means other than requiring proof of mate\u00ad\nriality at the class-certification stage. In enacting the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n109 Stat. 737, Congress recognized that although private\nsecurities-fraud litigation furthers important public-policy\ninterests, prime among them, deterring wrongdoing and\nproviding restitution to defrauded investors, such law-\nsuits have also been subject to abuse, including the\n\u201cextract[ion]\u201d of \u201cextortionate \u2018settlements\u2019 \u201d of frivolous\nclaims. H. R. Conf. Rep.

See 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778bb(f)(1) (2006 ed.).\n   While taking these steps to curb abusive securities\u00ad\nfraud lawsuits, Congress rejected calls to undo the fraud\u00ad\non-the-market presumption of classwide reliance endorsed\nin Basic. See Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking\nFraud on the Market, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 153, and n. 8\n(noting that the initial version of H. R. 10, 104th Cong.,\n1st Sess.

Nor did Congress decree that securities-fraud\nplaintiffs prove each element of their claim before obtain\u00ad\ning class certification. Because Congress has homed in on\nthe precise policy concerns raised in Amgen\u2019s brief, \u201c[w]e\ndo not think it appropriate for the judiciary to make its\nown further adjustments by reinterpreting Rule 23 to\nmake likely success on the merits essential to class certifi\u00ad\ncation in securities-fraud suits.\u201d Schleicher, 618 F. 3d, at\n686; cf.

Amgen\u2019s argument, if embraced, would\nnecessitate a mini-trial on the issue of materiality at the\nclass-certification stage. Such preliminary adjudications\nwould entail considerable expenditures of judicial time\nand resources, costs scarcely anticipated by Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A), which instructs that the\ndecision whether to certify a class action be made \u201c[a]t an\nearly practicable time.\u201d If the class is certified, materiality\nmight have to be shown all over again at trial. And if\ncertification is denied for failure to prove materiality,\nnonnamed class members would not be bound by that\ndetermination. See Smith, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 12\u201318). They would be free to renew the fray, perhaps\nin another forum, perhaps with a stronger showing of\nmateriality.\n   Given the tenuousness of Amgen\u2019s judicial-economy\nargument, Amgen\u2019s policy arguments ultimately return to\nthe contention that private securities-fraud actions should\nbe hemmed in to mitigate their potentially \u201cvexatiou[s]\u201d\ncharacter.

In JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s view, the Court\u2019s decision in Basic established a\nspecial rule: A securities-fraud class action cannot be\ncertified unless all of the prerequisites of the fraud-on-the\u00ad\nmarket presumption of reliance, including materiality,\nhave first been established.

But again, as earlier explained, see supra, at\n10\u201313, individual reliance questions will not overwhelm\nquestions common to the class, for the class members\u2019\nclaims will have failed on their merits, thus bringing the\nlitigation to a close. Therefore, just as a plaintiff class\u2019s\ninability to prove materiality creates no risk that individ\u00ad\nual questions will predominate, so even a definitive rebut\u00ad\ntal on the issue of materiality would not undermine the\npredominance of questions common to the class.\n   We recognized as much in Basic itself.

This rule is to be found nowhere in the United\nStates Code or in the common law of fraud or deception; it\nwas invented by the Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485\nU. S. 224 (1988). Today\u2019s Court applies to that rule the\nprinciples of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), and\nthereby concludes (logically enough) that commonality is\nestablished at the certification stage even when material-\nity has not been shown. That would be a correct procedure\nif Basic meant the rule it announced to govern only the\nquestion of substantive liability\u2014what must be shown in\norder to prevail. If that were so, the new substantive rule,\nlike the more general substantive rule that reliance must\nbe proved, would be subject, at the certification stage, to\nthe commonality analysis of Rule 23(b)(3). In my view,\nhowever, the Basic rule of fraud-on-the-market\u2014a well\nfunctioning market plus purchase or sale in the market\nplus material misrepresentation known to the market\nestablishes a necessary showing of reliance\u2014governs not\nonly the question of substantive liability, but also the\n2    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nquestion whether certification is proper. All of the ele-\nments of that rule, including materiality, must be estab-\nlished if and when it is relied upon to justify certification.\nThe answer to the question before us today is to be found\nnot in Rule 23(b)(3), but in the opinion of Basic.\n   Basic established a presumption that the misrepresen-\ntation was relied upon, not a mere presumption that the\nplaintiffs relied on the market price. And it established\nthat presumption not just for the question of substantive\nliability but also for the question of certification. \u201cWe\ngranted certiorari . . . to determine whether the courts\nbelow properly applied a presumption of reliance in certify-\ning the class, rather than requiring each class member to\nshow direct reliance on Basic\u2019s statements.\u201d 485 U. S., at\n230 (emphasis added). Of course it makes no sense to\n\u201cpresume reliance\u201d on the misrepresentation merely be-\ncause the plaintiff relied on the market price, unless the\nalleged misrepresentation would likely have affected the\nmarket price\u2014that is, unless it was material. Thus, as\nJUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent shows, the Basic opinion is shot\nthrough with references to the necessary materiality. The\npresumption of reliance does not apply, and hence neither\nsubstantive liability will attach nor will certification be\nproper, unless materiality is shown. The necessity of\nmateriality for certification is demonstrated by the last\nsentence of the Basic opinion, which comes after the Court\nhas decided to remand the case for reconsideration of\nmateriality under the appropriate legal standard: \u201cThe\nDistrict Court\u2019s certification of the class here was appro-\npriate when made but is subject on remand to such ad-\njustment, if any, as developing circumstances demand.\u201d\nId., at 250. Those circumstances are the establishment of\nfacts that rebut the presumption, including of facts that\nshow the misrepresentation was not material, or was not\nknown to the market.\n   The Court argues that if materiality were a predicate to\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

The Court manufactures an\ninconsistency on the basis of doctrine that did not govern\nclass certification at the time of Basic.

But review of the Basic certifi-\ncation order shows that the District Court\u2019s fraud-on-the-\nmarket analysis was based exclusively on the pleadings:\n\u201c[T]he allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are sufficient to\nbring this section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)(5) claim within the\nso-called \u2018fraud on the market\u2019 theory.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. in Basic Inc. v. Levinson, O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013279,\np. 115a (emphasis added); see also ibid. (citing complaint\nparagraphs as establishing fraud on the market). Under a\npleadings standard, the District Court found that the\nplaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3) with regard to fraud\non the market, including its materiality predicate. See id.,\nat 133a (denial of reconsideration) (\u201cThis court ruled on\nDecember 10 that transaction causation [i.e., reliance]\ncould be established by the following: proof of a material\nmisrepresentation which affected the market price of the\nstocks with a resulting injury to the plaintiffs\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). Thus, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded\nmateriality that the certification order \u201cwas appropriate\nwhen made,\u201d Basic, supra, at 250, the defendants retained\nan opportunity on remand to rebut the pleading in order to\ndefeat certification.*\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * As for the Court\u2019s contention that I have \u201c[s]cour[ed] the Court\u2019s\ndecision in Basic\u201d to find \u201csome semblance of support\u201d for my reading of\nthe case, ante, at 23, n. 9: It does not take much scouring to come across\n4     AMGEN, INC. v.

It does an injustice to the Basic Court to presume\nwithout clear evidence\u2014and indeed in the face of language\nto the contrary\u2014that it was establishing a regime in\nwhich not only those market class-action suits that have\nearned the presumption of reliance pass beyond the cru-\ncial certification stage, but all market-purchase and\nmarket-sale class-action suits do so, no matter what the al-\nleged misrepresentation. The opinion need not be read\nthis way, and it should not.\n  The fraud-on-the-market theory approved by Basic en-\nvisions a demonstration of materiality not just for sub-\nstantive recovery but for certification.

The Court does so by all but eliminating\nmateriality as one of the predicates of the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory, which serves as an alternative mode of es-\ntablishing reliance. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S.\n224, 241\u2013250 (1988). Without demonstrating materiality\nat certification, plaintiffs cannot establish Basic\u2019s fraud-\non-the-market presumption. Without proof of fraud on the\nmarket, plaintiffs cannot show that otherwise individual-\nized questions of reliance will predominate, as required\nby Rule 23(b)(3). And without satisfying Rule 23(b)(3),\nclass certification is improper. Fraud on the market is\nthus a condition precedent to class certification, without\nwhich individualized questions of reliance will defeat\ncertification.\n   The Court\u2019s opinion depends on the following assump-\ntion: Plaintiffs will either (1) establish materiality at the\nmerits stage, in which case class certification was proper\n2       AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                        AND TRUST FUNDS\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nbecause reliance turned out to be a common question, or\n(2) fail to establish materiality, in which case the claim\nwould fail on the merits, notwithstanding the fact that\nthe class should not have been certified in the first place,\nbecause reliance was never a common question. The\nfailure to establish materiality retrospectively confirms\nthat fraud on the market was never established, that\nquestions regarding the element of reliance were not\ncommon under Rule 23(b)(3), and, by extension, that\ncertification was never proper. Plaintiffs cannot be ex-\ncused of their Rule 23 burden to show at certification that\nquestions of reliance are common merely because they\nmight lose later on the merits element of materiality.\nBecause a securities-fraud plaintiff invoking Basic\u2019s fraud-\non-the-market presumption to satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) should\nbe required to prove each of the predicates of that theory\nat certification in order to demonstrate that questions of\nreliance are common to the class, I respectfully dissent.\n                             A\n  We begin with \u00a710 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, 15 U.

I thus limit my dissent to demonstrating that the\nCourt is not following Basic\u2019s dictates.\n   Moreover, the Court acknowledges there is disagreement as to\nwhether market efficiency is \u201c \u2018 \u201ca binary, yes or no question,\u201d \u2019 \u201d or in-\nstead operates differently depending on the information at issue, see\nante, at 14, n. 6 (quoting Brief for Petitioners 32, in turn quoting\nLangevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market, 2009\nWis.

See, e.g., ante, at 9 (materiality is \u201cindisputably\u201d\n\u201can essential predicate of the fraud-on-the-market the-\nory\u201d); Brief for Respondent 29 (\u201cIf the statement is not\nmaterially false, then no one in the class can establish\nreliance via the integrity of the market\u201d). The materiality\nof a specific statement is, therefore, essential to the fraud-\non-the-market presumption, which in turn enables a\nplaintiff to prove reliance.\n                             B\n    Basic\u2019s fraud-on-the-market presumption is highly sig-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The United States as amicus curiae invokes Rule 23(a)(3) to suggest\n\nthat the third element, the timing of the relevant stock trades, is a\n\u201climit on the definition of the class.\u201d Brief for United States 15, n. 2.\nBut it is also necessary to establish the timing of the allegedly material,\npublic misstatement made into an allegedly efficient market (as well as\nwhen the fraud ended due to entry of truth on the market) before the\nfraud-on-the-market theory can be evaluated under Rule 23(b)(3).\nThus, the lower court opinion in Basic expressly identified \u201cthe time the\nmisrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed\u201d as\npart of fraud on the market. Levinson v. Basic Inc., 786 F. 2d 741, 750\n(CA6 1986). The Basic Court cited the formulation approvingly, 485\nU. S., at 248, n. 27, and recently in Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halli-\nburton Co., 563 U. S. ___ (2011), the Court cited the same language as\npart of the \u201cundisputed\u201d elements a securities-fraud plaintiff must\nprove to invoke Basic. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5\u20136) (quoting Basic,\nsupra, at 248, n. 27). Unless the timing of the misrepresentation and\ntruth is established at certification, there is no framework within which\nto determine whether fraud on the market renders reliance a common\nquestion. Thus, insofar as the majority recognizes that timing is a\nfactor of the fraud-on-the-market theory, ante, at 16, n. 8, I agree. It\nwould be incorrect to suggest that timing solely relates to Rules 23(a)(3)\nand (4). It is equally important to establish the timing range at certifi-\ncation for Rule 23(b)(3) reliance purposes. This fact undercuts the\nmajority\u2019s attempt to isolate materiality as the only factor of fraud on\nthe market that need not be shown at certification to demonstrate that\nreliance is a common question.\n                    Cite as: 568 U.

See, e.g., Wal-\nMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 6 (2011)\n(slip op., at 11, n. 6) (\u201c[P]laintiffs seeking 23(b)(3) certifi-\ncation must prove that their shares were traded on an ef-\nficient market,\u201d an element of the fraud-on-the-market\ntheory (emphasis added)). Without that proof, there is\nno justification for certifying a class because there is no\n\u201c \u2018capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common\nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310) (quoting Nagareda, Class Certifi-\ncation in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N. Y. U. L. Rev.\n97, 132 (2009)).\n    If plaintiffs fail to show that reliance is a common ques-\ntion at the time of certification, certification is improper.\nFor if reliance is not a common question, each plaintiff\nwould be required to prove that he in fact relied on a\nmisstatement, a showing which is simply not susceptible\nto classwide proof. Individuals make stock transactions\nfor divergent, even idiosyncratic, reasons. As the leading\npre-Basic fraud-on-the-market case recognized, \u201c[a] pur-\nchaser on the stock exchanges may be either unaware of a\nspecific false representation, or may not directly rely on it;\nhe may purchase because of a favorable price trend, price\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 7 There is no dispute that respondent meets the prerequisites of Fed.\n\nRule Civ.

Barrack,\n524 F. 2d 891, 907 (CA9 1975). The inquiry\u2019s inherently\nindividualized nature renders it impossible to generate the\ncommon answers necessary for certification under Rule\n23(b)(3). See Basic, 485 U. S., at 242 (\u201cRequiring proof of\nindividualized reliance from each member of the proposed\nplaintiff class effectively would have prevented respond-\nents from proceeding with a class action, since individual\nissues then would have overwhelmed the common ones\u201d).\n   The Court\u2019s solution in Basic was to allow putative class\nmembers to prove reliance through the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption. Id., at 241\u2013250. As the Court today\nrecognizes, failure to establish fraud on the market \u201cleaves\nopen the prospect of individualized proof of reliance.\u201d\nAnte, at 17. Notably, the Court and the Ninth Circuit both\nacknowledge that in order to obtain the benefit of the\npresumption, plaintiffs must establish two of the fraud-on-\nthe-market predicates at class certification: (1) that the\nmarket was generally efficient, and (2) that the alleged\nmisstatement was public. See ante, at 16 (acknowledging\n\u201cthat market efficiency and the public nature of the alleged\nmisrepresentations must be proved before a securities-\nfraud class action can be certified\u201d); 660 F. 3d 1170, 1175\n(CA9 2011) (same). See also Erica P. John Fund, 563\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (\u201cIt is undisputed that\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs must prove,\u201d at certification\ninter alia, \u201cthat the alleged misrepresentations were pub-\nlicly known . . . [and] that the stock traded in an efficient\nmarket\u201d). The Court is correct insofar as its statements\nrecognize that fraud on the market is a condition prece-\ndent to showing that there are common questions of reli-\nance at the time of class certification.\n   Nevertheless, the Court asserts that materiality\u2014by its\nown admission an essential predicate to invoking fraud\non the market\u2014need not be established at certification\nbecause it will ultimately be proved at the merits stage.\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

This assertion is an express admission\nthat parties will not know at certification whether reliance\nis an individual or common question.\n   To support its position, the Court transforms the predi-\ncate certification inquiry into a novel either-or inquiry\noccurring much later on the merits. According to the\nCourt, either (1) plaintiffs will prove materiality on the\nmerits, thus demonstrating ex post that common questions\npredominated at certification, or (2) they will fail to prove\nmateriality, at which point we learn ex post that certifica-\ntion was inappropriate because reliance was not, in fact, a\ncommon question. In the Court\u2019s second scenario, fraud\non the market was never established, reliance for each\nclass member was inherently individualized, and Rule\n23(b)(3) in fact should have barred certification long ago.8\nThe Court suggests that the problem created by the second\nscenario is excusable because the plaintiffs will lose any-\nway on alternative merits grounds, and the case will be\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The majority ignores this explanation of the fundamental flaw in\n\nits position, asserting that I never \u201cexplain how . . . a plaintiff class\u2019s\nfailure to prove an essential element of its claim for relief will result in\nindividual questions predominating over common ones.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nBut a plaintiff, who is excused from his burden of showing, at certifi-\ncation that reliance is a common question, fails to demonstrate that\ncommon questions predominate over the individualized questions of re-\nliance that are inherent in a securities fraud claim. A plaintiff must\ncarry this burden at certification for certification to be proper. The\nmajority does not respond to the inherent timing problem in its posi-\ntion. It does not explain how ignoring questions of reliance\u2014that\nundeniably will be individualized in some cases\u2014at certification is\njustified by the fact that those questions will be resolved months or\nyears later on the merits in a way that indicates reliance was indeed an\nindividualized question all along. Far from obeying the dictates of Rule\n23(b)(3) as it claims, ante, at 12\u201313, the majority unjustifiably puts off a\ncritical part of the Rule 23(b)(3) inquiry until the merits. The only way\nthe majority can purport to follow Rule 23(b)(3) is by ignoring the fact\nthat, under its own analysis, reliance may be an individualized ques-\ntion that predominates over common questions at certification.\n10   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nover. See ante, at 17 (\u201c[F]ailure of proof on the issue of\nmateriality [at the merits stage] . . . not only precludes a\nplaintiff from invoking the fraud-on-the-market presump-\ntion of classwide reliance; it also establishes as a matter of\nlaw that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the merits of her\nRule 10b\u20135 claim\u201d). But nothing in logic or precedent\njustifies ignoring at certification whether reliance is sus-\nceptible to Rule 23(b)(3) classwide proof simply because\none predicate of reliance\u2014materiality\u2014will be resolved, if\nat all, much later in the litigation on an independent\nmerits element.\n   It is the Court, not Amgen, that \u201cwould have us put the\ncart before the horse,\u201d ante, at 3, by jumping chronologi-\ncally to the \u00a710(b) merits element of materiality. But Rule\n23, as well as common sense, requires class certification\nissues to be addressed first. See Rule 23(c)(1)(A) (\u201cAt an\nearly practicable time after a person sues or is sued . . .\nthe court must determine by order whether to certify the\naction as a class action\u201d). A plaintiff who cannot prove\nmateriality does not simply have a claim that is \u201c \u2018dead on\narrival\u2019 \u201d at the merits, ante, at 17 (quoting 660 F. 3d, at\n1175); he has a class that should never have arrived at the\nmerits at all because it failed Rule 23(b)(3) certification\nfrom the outset. Without materiality, there is no fraud-\non-the-market presumption, questions of reliance remain\nindividualized, and Rule 23(b)(3) certification is impossi-\nble. And the fact that evidence of materiality goes to both\nfraud on the market at certification and an independent\nmerits element is no issue; Wal-Mart expressly held that a\ncourt at certification may inquire into questions that also\nhave later relevance on the merits. See 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10\u201311). The Court reverses that inquiry,\neffectively saying that certification may be put off until\nlater because an adverse merits determination will retro-\nactively wipe out the entire class. However, a plaintiff\nwho cannot prove materiality cannot prove fraud on the\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 10 (\u201c[T]he piv-\notal inquiry is whether proof of materiality is needed to\nensure that the questions of law or fact common to the\nclass will \u2018predominate\u2019 \u201d). The result is that the Court\neffectively equates \u00a710(b) materiality with fraud-on-the-\nmarket materiality and elides reliance as a \u00a710(b) ele-\nment. But a plaintiff seeking certification under Rule 23\nbears the burden of proof with regard to all the elements\nof a \u00a710(b) claim, which includes materiality and reliance.\nAs Wal-Mart explained, \u201c[a] party seeking class certifica-\ntion must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 Of course, the Court\u2019s assertion that materiality will be resolved on\n\nthe merits presumes that certification will not bring in terrorem settle-\nment pressures to bear, foreclosing any materiality inquiry at all. The\nCourt dismisses this concern, ante, at 18\u201320, attempting to give fraud-\non-the-market analysis the imprimatur of congressional enactment\ninstead of recognizing it as a judicially created doctrine grafted onto an\nimplied cause of action. But the fact that Congress has enacted legisla-\ntion to curb excesses in securities litigation while leaving Basic intact,\nsee ante, at 19\u201320, says nothing about the proper interpretation of\nBasic at issue here. The Court retains discretion over the contours of\nBasic unless and until Congress sees fit to alter them\u2014a fact Congress\nmust also have realized when it passed the Private Securities Litiga-\ntion Reform Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 737, and other legislation. The\nCourt\u2019s entire argument is based on the assumption that the fraud-on-\nthe-market presumption need not be shown at certification because it\nwill be proved later on the merits; insofar as certification makes that\nlater determination unlikely to occur, it at least counsels against the\ncertitude with which the Court assures us that its gloss on Basic is\ncorrect.\n12   AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                     AND TRUST FUNDS\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nthe Rule\u2014that is, he must be prepared to prove that there\nare in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common ques-\ntions of law or fact, etc.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nIf the elements of fraud on the market are not proved at\ncertification, a plaintiff has failed to carry his burden of\nestablishing that questions of individualized reliance will\nnot predominate, without which the plaintiff class cannot\nobtain certification. Cf. id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (holding\nin Rule 23(a)(2) context that \u201c[w]ithout some glue hold-\ning the alleged reasons for all those decisions together, it\nwill be impossible to say that examination of all the class\nmembers\u2019 claims for relief will produce a common an-\nswer\u201d). It is only by establishing all of the elements of the\nfraud-on-the-market presumption that reliance can be\nproved on a classwide basis. Therefore, if a plaintiff wishes\nto use Basic\u2019s presumption to prove that reliance is a\ncommon question, he must establish the entire presump-\ntion, including materiality, at the class certification stage.\n   Nor is it relevant, as respondent argues, that requiring\nplaintiffs to establish all predicates of fraud on the market\nat certification will make it more difficult to obtain certifi-\ncation. See Brief for Respondent 35\u201338. In Basic, four\nJustices of a six-Justice Court created the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption from a combination of newly minted\neconomic theories, 485 U. S., at 250\u2013251, n. 1 (White, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), and \u201cconsidera-\ntions of fairness, public policy, and probability,\u201d id., at 245\n(majority opinion), to allow claims that otherwise would\nhave been barred due to the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to show\nreliance, id., at 242. Basic is a judicially invented doctrine\nbased on an economic theory adopted to ease the burden\non plaintiffs bringing claims under an implied cause of\naction. There is nothing untoward about requiring plain-\ntiffs to take the steps that the Basic Court created in an\neffort to save otherwise inadequate claims.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Its shortcomings are further highlighted by\nthe role that materiality played in the pre-Basic develop-\nment of the fraud-on-the-market theory as a condition\nprecedent to showing that there are common questions of\nreliance in the class-action context. Materiality, at the\ntime of certification, has been a driving force behind\nthe theory from the outset. This fact further supports the\nneed to prove materiality at the time the fraud-on-the-\nmarket theory is invoked to show that questions of reli-\nance can be answered on a classwide basis.\n                              A\n   Before Basic, two signposts marked the way for courts\napplying the fraud-on-the-market theory. Both demon-\nstrate that the materiality of an alleged falsehood was not\na mere afterthought but rather one of the primary reasons\nfor allowing traditional proof of reliance to be brushed\naside at certification. This fact weighs strongly in favor of\nthe conclusion that materiality must be resolved at certi-\nfication when the fraud-on-the-market presumption is\ninvoked to show that reliance can be proved on a classwide\nbasis.\n   The first signpost was the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 1975 opinion\nin Blackie, termed by one pre-Basic court the \u201cseminal\nfraud on the market case.\u201d Peil, 806 F. 2d, at 1163, n. 16.\nSee also Basic, supra, at 251, n. 1 (White, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cThe earliest Court of Appeals case adopting this theory\ncited by the Court is Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F. 2d 891\n(CA9 1975), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 816 (1976)\u201d).\n   Blackie arose from a $90 million loss reported by audio\nequipment manufacturer Ampex Corp. in its 1972 annual\nreport. 524 F. 2d, at 894.10 Ampex\u2019s independent auditors\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 10 Ampex\u2019s   sales for 1971 were just under $284 million.

In resultant class ac-\ntions, the defendants argued that reliance stood in the\nway of class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because it\nwas not a common question.\n   The Ninth Circuit disagreed. Instead, it relieved plain-\ntiffs from providing traditional proof of reliance, ex-\nplaining that \u201ccausation is adequately established in the\nimpersonal stock exchange context by proof of purchase and\nof the materiality of misrepresentations, without direct proof\nof reliance.\u201d Id., at 906 (emphasis added). The court left\nno doubt that the materiality of the $90 million shortfall\nin Ampex\u2019s financial statements was central to its deter-\nmination that reliance could be presumed. It asserted\nthat \u201c[m]ateriality circumstantially establishes the reli-\nance of some market traders and hence the inflation in the\nstock price\u2014when the purchase is made[,] the causational\nchain between defendant\u2019s conduct and plaintiff \u2019s loss is\nsufficiently established to make out a prima facie case.\u201d\nIbid. Materiality was not merely an important factor that\nallowed reliance to be presumed at certification; materiali-\nty was the factor. It demonstrated that the defendants\nhad committed a fraud on the market, that all putative\nclass plaintiffs had relied on it in purchasing stock, and,\ntherefore, that questions of reliance would be susceptible\nto common answers.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nA. & P.

Ulti-\nmately, in language that will be familiar to anyone who\nhas read Basic, the Note formulated a \u201cpivotal assump-\ntion\u201d underlying the fraud-on-the-market theory as the\nbelief that:\n     \u201cmarket prices respond to information disseminated\n     (or not disseminated) concerning the companies whose\n     securities are traded. In such a setting\u2014often de-\n     scribed as an \u2018efficient market\u2019\u2014the reliance of some\n     traders upon a material deception influences market\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprove direct reliance on defendants' misrepresentations, but can satisfy\ntheir burden of proof on the element of causation by showing that the\ndefendants made material misrepresentations\u201d (footnote omitted));\nPanzirer v. Wolf, 663 F. 2d 365, 368 (CA2 1981) (\u201cBlackie held that the\nmateriality of a fraud creates a presumption of reliance through its\npresumed effect on the market. . . . Our holding is no more than an\nextension of Blackie\u201d).\n16    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n     prices and thereby affects even traders who never\n     read or hear of the deception.\u201d Harv. L. Rev. Note\n     1154 (footnote omitted).\n  Again, the materiality of the alleged misstatement was\na key component, without which the market could not be\npresumed to move. As a result, without materiality it is\nimpossible to say that there has been a fraud on the mar-\nket at all, and if that is not the case there is no reason to\nbelieve that the market price at which stock transactions\noccurred was affected by an alleged misstatement or, by\nextension, that any market participants relied on it.\nMateriality should thus be proved when the fraud-on-the-\nmarket presumption is invoked, or there is no common-\nality with respect to questions of reliance.\n                              B\n   Nor did the importance of materiality diminish in the\nSixth Circuit opinion reviewed in Basic. Rather, the court\nfollowed the path marked by the signposts discussed\nabove. It excused plaintiffs from offering traditional evi-\ndence of reliance, so long as \u201ca defendant is shown to have\nmade a material public misrepresentation that, if relied\non directly, would fraudulently induce an individual to mis-\njudge the value of the stock.\u201d Levinson, 786 F. 2d, at 750\n(emphasis added). The court\u2019s analysis made clear that\nmateriality should be demonstrated at the time the pre-\nsumption was invoked: \u201cIn order to invoke the presump-\ntion of reliance based upon the fraud on the market theory,\na plaintiff must allege and prove . . . that the mis-\nrepresentations were material . . . .\u201d Ibid. (citing Blackie,\n524 F. 2d, at 906).\n                            C\n  Finally, the briefing before this Court in Basic itself\nbuilt upon this framework and the foundational principle\nthat materiality is an integral part of the theory. Criti-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            17\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncally, the Basic defendants argued that the plaintiffs could\nnot establish fraud on the market at certification even if\nthe theory were valid because the alleged misstatement\nwas immaterial. They \u201ccontrast[ed] the likely market\nimpact of disclosure of the [$90 million Blackie loss] . . .\nwith the disclosure of the information which respondents\ncontend[ed] rendered Basic\u2019s statements materially mis-\nleading.\u201d See Brief for Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013\n279, p. 42. The Basic defendants concluded that \u201cthe\ndifferences between a company\u2019s $90 million loss and a\ncompany\u2019s sporadic contacts with a friendly suitor are sub-\nstantial. . . . [T]he fraud on the market theory, if it has\nvitality, should not be applied in a case such as this.\u201d Id.,\nat 43.\n   In response, the plaintiffs in Basic did not argue that\nthe defendants misunderstood the role of materiality in\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory. They instead advanced a\nnow-foreclosed interpretation of dicta from Eisen v. Car-\nlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974):\n    \u201cPetitioners\u2019 final argument\u2014that respondents will be\n    unable to establish that Basic\u2019s repeated false and\n    misleading statements impacted the price of Basic\n    stock over a fourteen month period\u2014represents an ef-\n    fort to litigate the merits of this case on the motion for\n    class certification. . . . As this Court held in Eisen v.\n    Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156, 177 (1974): \u2018We\n    find nothing in either the language or history of Rule\n    23 that gives a court any authority to conduct a pre-\n    liminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to\n    determine whether it may be maintained as a class\n    action.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013\n    279, p. 54.\n  The Court rejected this reading of Eisen two Terms ago,\nexplaining that the very language the Basic plaintiffs\nquoted was \u201csometimes mistakenly cited\u201d as prohibiting\n18    AMGEN, INC. v. CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS\n                      AND TRUST FUNDS\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ninquiry into \u201cthe propriety of certification under Rules\n23(a) and (b).\u201d Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U. S., at ___,\nn. 6 (slip op., at 10, n. 6). That reading, the Court ex-\nplained, \u201cis the purest dictum and is contradicted by our\nother cases.\u201d Ibid. The Basic defendants\u2019 reply is con-\nsistent with Wal-Mart:\n     \u201cPutative class representatives, such as respondents,\n     should not be permitted to invoke the fraud on the\n     market theory while, at the same time, arguing that\n     courts may not make any preliminary inquiry into the\n     claimed impact on the market. See, e.g., Resp. Br.,\n     p. 54. By seeking the benefit of the presumption, re-\n     spondents necessarily invite judicial scrutiny of the\n     circumstances in which it is invoked.\u201d Reply Brief for\n     Petitioners in O. T. 1987, No. 86\u2013279, p. 18.\n   Well said. The history of Basic is worth the volume of\nargument offered by the majority. Cf. New York Trust Co.\nv. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (majority opinion of\nHolmes, J.). Materiality was central to the development,\nanalysis, and adoption of the fraud-on-the-market theory\nboth before Basic and in Basic itself. Materiality, there-\nfore, must be demonstrated to prove fraud on the market,\nand until materiality of an alleged misstatement is shown\nthere is no reason to believe that all market participants\nhave relied equally on it. Otherwise individualized ques-\ntions of reliance remain. This history confirms that mate-\nriality must be proved at the time that the theory is\ninvoked\u2014i.e., at certification.\n                             III\n  I, thus, would reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit\nand hold that a plaintiff invoking the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption bears the burden to establish all the ele-\nments of fraud on the market at certification, including\nthe materiality of the alleged misstatement.\n</pre>",
