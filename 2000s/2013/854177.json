UNITED STATES ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11–1351. Argued January 15, 2013—Decided March 4, 2013\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Government’s sover-\n  eign immunity from tort suits, 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1), but excepts\n  from the waiver certain intentional torts, including battery, §2680(h).\n  The FTCA, as originally enacted, afforded tort victims a remedy\n  against the United States, but did not preclude suit against the al-\n  leged tortfeasor as sole or joint defendant. Several agency-specific\n  statutes postdating the FTCA, however, immunized certain federal\n  employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of\n  their official duties. One such statute, the Gonzalez Act, makes the\n  remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any\n  suit against armed forces medical personnel. 10 U. S. C. §1089(a).\n  The Act also provides that, “[f]or purposes of this section,” the inten-\n  tional tort exception to the FTCA “shall not apply to any cause of ac-\n  tion arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the per-\n  formance of medical . . . functions.” §1089(e). Congress subsequently\n  enacted comprehensive legislation, the Federal Employees Liability\n  Reform and Tort Compensation Act (Liability Reform Act), which\n  makes the FTCA’s remedy against the United States exclusive for\n  torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their\n  employment, 28 U. S. C. §2679(b)(1). Under the Liability Reform Act,\n  federal employees are shielded without regard to agency affiliation or\n  line of work.\n     Petitioner Levin suffered injuries as a result of cataract surgery\n  performed at a U. S. Naval Hospital. He filed suit, naming the United\n  States and the surgeon as defendants and asserting, inter alia, a\n  claim of battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to oper-\n  ate shortly before the surgery took place. Finding that the surgeon\n  had acted within the scope of his employment, the District Court re-\n2                      LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    leased him and substituted the United States as sole defendant. The\n    Government moved to dismiss the battery claim, relying on the\n    FTCA’s intentional tort exception. Levin countered that the Gonza-\n    lez Act, in particular, §1089(e), renders that exception inapplicable\n    when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by a military physician. The\n    District Court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss. Affirm-\n    ing, the Ninth Circuit concluded that §1089(e) served only to buttress\n    the immunity from personal liability granted military medical per-\n    sonnel in §1089(a), and did not negate the FTCA’s intentional tort ex-\n    ception.\nHeld: The Gonzalez Act direction in §1089(e) abrogates the FTCA’s in-\n tentional tort exception and therefore permits Levin’s suit against\n the United States alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting\n within the scope of his employment. Pp. 8–15.\n    (a) To determine whether the Government’s immunity is waived for\n batteries, the Court looks to §1089(e)’s language, “giving the ‘words\n used’ their ‘ordinary meaning.’ ” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n 103, 108. Levin claims that the operative clause of §1089(e), which\n provides that the FTCA’s intentional tort exception “shall not apply”\n to medical malpractice claims, is qualified by the provision’s intro-\n ductory clause “[f]or purposes of this section,” which confines the op-\n erative clause to claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the\n armed forces and the other agencies specified in the Gonzalez Act.\n The Government, in contrast, argues that §1089(e)’s introductory\n clause instructs courts to pretend, “[f]or purposes of” the Gonzalez\n Act, that §2680(h) does not secure the Government against liability\n for intentional torts, including battery, even though §2680(h) does\n provide that shelter. The choice between the parties’ dueling con-\n structions is not a difficult one. Section 1089(e)’s operative clause\n states, in no uncertain terms, that the FTCA’s intentional tort excep-\n tion, §2680(h), “shall not apply,” and §1089(e)’s introductory clause\n confines the abrogation of §2680(h) to medical personnel employed by\n the agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act. Had Congress wanted to\n adopt the Government’s counterfactual interpretation, it could have\n used more precise language, as it did in §1089(c), a subsection adja-\n cent to §1089(e). Pp. 8–11.\n    (b) Under the Government’s interpretation of §1089(e), the Liabil-\n ity Reform Act would displace much of the Gonzalez Act. That read-\n ing conflicts with the view the Government stated in United States v.\n Smith, 499 U. S. 160. There, the question was whether a person in-\n jured abroad due to a military doctor’s negligence may seek compen-\n sation from the doctor in a U. S. court, for the FTCA gave them no re-\n course against the Government on a “claim arising in a foreign\n country,” 28 U. S. C. §2680(k). In arguing that such persons also\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor, the Government con-\n  tended that the Liability Reform Act made “[t]he remedy against the\n  United States” under the FTCA “exclusive.” §2679(b)(1). This inter-\n  pretation, the Government argued, would not override the Gonzalez\n  Act, which would continue to serve two important functions: Title 10\n  U. S. C. §1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual\n  military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern; and\n  the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United\n  States if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did\n  not consent. Adopting the Government’s construction, the Court held\n  that §2679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical per-\n  sonnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even\n  when the FTCA provides no remedy against the United States. 499\n  U. S., at 166. Under the Government’s current reading of §1089(e),\n  the Liability Reform Act overrides the Gonzalez Act except in the\n  atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under\n  §1089(f)(1) remains possible, while under Levin’s reading, the Gonza-\n  lez Act does just what the Government said it did in Smith. Pp. 11–\n  13.\n    (c) The Government attempts to inject ambiguity into §1089(e) by\n  claiming that 38 U. S. C. §7316, a parallel statute that confers im-\n  munity on medical personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\n  expresses Congress’ intent to abrogate §2680(h) with the unmistaka-\n  ble clarity the Gonzalez Act lacks. But this Court sees nothing dis-\n  positively different about the wording of the two provisions, and nei-\n  ther did the Government when it argued in the District Court that\n  §1089(e) and §7316(f) are functionally indistinguishable.

S.\nNaval Hospital in Guam. He asserts that, just prior to the\noperation, concern about equipment in the operating room\nled him to withdraw his consent to the surgery. Seeking\ncompensation from the United States, Levin sued under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. §§1346(b),\n2671–2680, which waives the Government’s sovereign\nimmunity from tort suits, but excepts from the waiver\ncertain intentional torts, including battery, §2680(h).\nLevin relied on the Gonzalez Act, 10 U. S. C. §1089, which\nmakes the remedy against the United States under the\nFTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical\npersonnel, §1089(a). In the provision at issue in this case,\n§1089(e), the Gonzalez Act declares that, “[f]or purposes\nof ” the Act, the intentional tort exception to the FTCA\n“shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a\nnegligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance\nof medical . . . functions.”\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins this opinion, except as to footnotes 6 and 7.\n2                         LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government reads §1089(e) simply to shore up\n§1089(a)’s immunization of medical personnel against tort\nliability. Levin, in contrast, reads §1089(e) to establish\nhis right to bring a claim of medical battery against the\nUnited States under the FTCA without encountering the\nintentional tort exception. The U. S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Guam, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, dismissed\nLevin’s battery claim based on the reading of the Gonzalez\nAct proffered by the Government. We find the Govern-\nment’s reading strained, and Levin’s, far more compatible\nwith the text and purpose of the federal legislation. We\ntherefore reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The FTCA, enacted in 1946, “was designed primarily to\nremove the sovereign immunity of the United States from\nsuits in tort.” Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 6\n(1962). The Act gives federal district courts exclusive\njurisdiction over claims against the United States for\n“injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission” of\nfederal employees acting within the scope of their em-\nployment. 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1). Substantively, the\nFTCA makes the United States liable “to the same extent\nas a private individual under like circumstances,” §2674,\nunder the law of the place where the tort occurred,\n§1346(b)(1), subject to enumerated exceptions to the im-\nmunity waiver, §§2680(a)–(n). The exception relevant in\nthis case is §2680(h), which, inter alia, preserves the\nGovernment’s immunity from suit on “[a]ny claim arising\nout of . . . battery.” We have referred to §2680(h) as the\n“intentional tort exception.” E.g., United States v. Shearer,\n473 U. S. 52, 54 (1985).1\n——————\n    1 This   shorthand description is not entirely accurate. Section 2680(h)\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Originally, the FTCA afforded tort victims a remedy\nagainst the United States, but did not preclude lawsuits\nagainst individual tortfeasors. See Henderson v. Blue-\nmink, 511 F. 2d 399, 404 (CADC 1974). Judgment against\nthe United States in an FTCA action would bar a sub-\nsequent action against the federal employee whose\nconduct gave rise to the claim, 28 U. S. C. §2676, but\nplaintiffs were not obliged to proceed exclusively against\nthe Government. They could sue as sole or joint defend-\nants federal employees alleged to have acted tortiously in\nthe course of performing their official duties.\n  In time, Congress enacted a series of agency-specific\nstatutes designed to shield precisely drawn classes of\nemployees from the threat of personal liability. United\nStates v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160, 170 (1991). One such\nmeasure was the Medical Malpractice Immunity Act, 90\nStat. 1985, 10 U. S. C. §1089, passed in 1976 and com-\nmonly known as the Gonzalez Act.2 That Act, controlling in\n——————\ndoes not remove from the FTCA’s waiver all intentional torts, e.g.,\nconversion and trespass, and it encompasses certain torts, e.g., misrep-\nresentation, that may arise out of negligent conduct. See United States\nv. Neustadt, 366 U. S. 696, 702 (1961).\n   2 The agency-specific statutes were patterned on the Federal Drivers\n\nAct, 75 Stat. 539, 28 U. S. C. §§2679(b)–(e) (1970 ed.), passed in 1961\nand amended in 1988 by Pub. L. 100–694, §5(b), 102 Stat. 4564. The\nDrivers Act made an action against the United States under the FTCA\nthe “exclusive” remedy for “personal injury . . . resulting from the\noperation by any employee of the Government of any motor vehicle\nwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.” §2679(b).\nStatutes conferring immunity on medical personnel of the Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 79 Stat. 1156, 38 U. S. C. §4116 (1970 ed.), now\ncodified at 38 U. S. C. §7316 (2006 ed.), and the Public Health Service,\n84 Stat. 1870, 42 U. S. C. §233 (2006 ed.), followed in 1965 and 1970,\nrespectively. In 1976, in addition to the Gonzalez Act, Congress enact-\ned a statute immunizing medical personnel of the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration, 90 Stat. 1988, 42 U. S. C. §2458a (1982 ed.),\nnow codified at 51 U. S. C. §20137 (2006 ed., Supp. IV). And in 1980, it\nenacted a personal immunity statute covering medical personnel of the\nDepartment of State, 94 Stat. 2155, 22 U. S. C. §2702 (2006 ed.).\n4                     LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthis case, makes claims against the United States under\nthe FTCA the “exclusive” remedy for injuries resulting\nfrom malpractice committed by medical personnel of the\narmed forces and other specified agencies. 10 U. S. C.\n§1089(a).3\n   A subsection of the Gonzalez Act key to the issue before\nus, §1089(e), refers to the FTCA’s intentional tort excep-\ntion. It provides: “For purposes of this section, the provi-\nsions of section 2680(h) of title 28 shall not apply to any\ncause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or\nomission in the performance of medical, dental, or related\nhealth care functions.” Section 1089(e) was patterned on a\nprovision in a statute, enacted six years earlier, that\nconferred immunity on medical personnel of the Public\nHealth Service. See 84 Stat. 1870, 42 U. S. C. §233(e)\n(1976 ed.) (“For purposes of this section, the provisions of\n[§2680(h)] shall not apply to assault or battery arising out\nof negligence in the performance of medical . . . func-\n\n——————\n    3 In\n       full, §1089(a) reads:\n   “The remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b)\nand 2672 of title 28 for damages for personal injury, including death,\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any physician,\ndentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting person-\nnel (including medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and\ntherapists) of the armed forces, the National Guard while engaged in\ntraining or duty under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32, the\nDepartment of Defense, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, or the\nCentral Intelligence Agency in the performance of medical, dental, or\nrelated health care functions (including clinical studies and investiga-\ntions) while acting within the scope of his duties or employment therein\nor therefor shall hereafter be exclusive of any other civil action or\nproceeding by reason of the same subject matter against such physi-\ncian, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting\npersonnel (or the estate of such person) whose act or omission gave rise\nto such action or proceeding. This subsection shall also apply if the\nphysician, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other support-\ning personnel (or the estate of such person) involved is serving under a\npersonal services contract entered into under section 1091 of this title.”\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions.”). Targeted immunity statutes enacted around the\nsame time as the Gonzalez Act similarly shielded medical\npersonnel employed by specific agencies. See supra, at 3,\nn. 2. Each such measure contained a provision resembling\n§1089(e). See 22 U. S. C. §2702(e) (“For purposes of this\nsection, the provisions of [§2680(h)], shall not apply to any\ntort enumerated therein arising out of negligence in the\nfurnishing of medical care or related services.”); 38\nU. S. C. §7316(f) (“The exception provided in [§2680(h)]\nshall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent or\nwrongful act or omission of any person described in sub-\nsection (a) in furnishing medical care or treatment . . .\nwhile in the exercise of such person’s duties in or for the\nAdministration.”); 51 U. S. C. §20137(e) (“For purposes of\nthis section, the provisions of [§2680(h)] shall not apply to\nany cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrong-\nful act or omission in the performance of medical . . .\nfunctions.”).\n   In 1988, departing from the above-described agency-\nspecific approach, Congress enacted comprehensive legis-\nlation titled the Federal Employees Liability Reform and\nTort Compensation Act (Liability Reform Act), 102 Stat.\n4563, and often called the Westfall Act. This embracive\nmeasure makes the remedy against the United States\nunder the FTCA exclusive for torts committed by federal\nemployees acting within the scope of their employment, 28\nU. S. C. §2679(b)(1). Shielding all federal employees from\npersonal liability without regard to agency affiliation or\nline of work, the personal immunity provision of the Lia-\nbility Reform Act tracks the text of §1089(a). The compre-\nhensive enactment, however, did not repeal the Gonzalez\nAct, Smith, 499 U. S., at 172, or, presumably, any of the\nother laws covering medical personnel employed at partic-\nular agencies. Unlike the Gonzalez Act and kindred stat-\nutes, the Liability Reform Act does not reference, as\n§1089(e) does, the FTCA’s intentional tort exception, 28\n6                    LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §2680(h).\n                               B\n   The petitioner, Steven Alan Levin, a veteran, was diag-\nnosed with a cataract in his right eye. He sought treat-\nment at the United States Naval Hospital in Guam and\nwas evaluated by Lieutenant Commander Frank Bishop,\nM. D., an ophthalmologist serving in the U. S. Navy. Dr.\nBishop recommended that Levin undergo “phacoemulsifi-\ncation with intraocular lens placement,” a surgical proce-\ndure involving extraction of the cataract and insertion of\nan artificial replacement lens. Levin signed forms con-\nsenting to the operation, which took place on March 12,\n2003. Shortly before the surgery began, Levin alleges, he\norally withdrew his consent twice, but Dr. Bishop con-\nducted the operation nevertheless. Due to complications oc-\ncurring while the surgery was underway, Levin developed\ncorneal edema, a condition that left him with diminished\neyesight, discomfort, problems with glare and depth-of-\nfield vision, and in need of ongoing medical treatment.\n   Levin sought compensation for the untoward results of\nthe surgery. After exhausting administrative remedies,\nhe commenced a civil action in the U. S. District Court for\nthe District of Guam. Naming the United States and Dr.\nBishop as defendants, Levin asserted claims of battery,\nbased on his alleged withdrawal of consent to the surgery,\nand negligence, based on alleged flaws in Dr. Bishop’s\nperformance of the operation. Accepting the Government’s\nrepresentation that Dr. Bishop was acting within the\nscope of his employment while performing the surgery, the\nDistrict Court granted the Government’s motion to release\nDr. Bishop and substitute the United States as sole de-\nfendant. When Levin failed to produce expert testimony\nin support of his negligence allegations, the court granted\nthe Government’s motion for summary judgment on that\nclaim.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Next, the Government moved to dismiss the battery\nclaim. The District Court no longer had jurisdiction over\nLevin’s case, the Government argued, because the FTCA’s\nintentional tort exception, §2680(h), disallows suits\nagainst the United States for battery. Levin countered\nthat the Gonzalez Act, in particular, §1089(e), renders the\nintentional tort exception inapplicable when a plaintiff\nalleges medical battery by an armed forces physician. The\nDistrict Court rejected Levin’s plea and granted the Gov-\nernment’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a–41a.\n  On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, Levin did not question\nthe adverse judgment on his negligent performance claim,\nbut he renewed the argument that the battery claim,\nbased on his alleged withdrawal of consent, survived.\nThat was so, he maintained, because §1089(e) negated\n§2680(h), the FTCA’s intentional tort exception. The\nCourt of Appeals thought Levin’s construction of the Gon-\nzalez Act “plausible,” but “not the best reading of the\nstatute.” 663 F. 3d 1059, 1062 (2011). As perceived by the\nNinth Circuit, §1089(e) had a limited office, serving only to\nbuttress the immunity from personal liability granted\nmilitary medical personnel in §1089(a). “[C]lever tort\nplaintiffs,” the court conjectured, might argue in future\ncases that because the FTCA does not authorize battery\nclaims against the United States, such claims may be\nasserted against military doctors notwithstanding\n§1089(a). Ibid. Section 1089(e) foreclosed that argument,\nbut the provision did nothing more, the court concluded.\nSatisfied that §1089(e) served the dominant purpose of the\nGonzalez Act—to immunize covered medical personnel\nagainst malpractice liability—and did not unequivocally\nwaive the United States’ sovereign immunity from battery\nclaims, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s\n8                    LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndisposition.4\n   We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), recognizing\nthat Courts of Appeals have divided on the question\nwhether the controlling provision of the Gonzalez Act,\n§1089(e), authorizes battery claims against the United\nStates when military doctors operate without the patient’s\nconsent. Compare 663 F. 3d, at 1063 (case below), with\nKeir v.

Levin, on the other\nhand, urges that, in view of the FTCA’s sweeping waiver of immunity,\n§1346(b)(1), exceptions to that waiver, contained in §2680, should not\nbe accorded an unduly generous interpretation. See Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioner 40 (citing Dolan v.\nPostal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 492 (2006)). We need not settle this\ndispute.

See 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1); supra, at 2. Or they\nmay be based on alleged lack of consent, therefore qualify-\ning as batteries. Whether the Government’s immunity is\nwaived for such claims depends on the meaning of 10\nU. S. C. §1089(e). See supra, at 4.\n   In determining the meaning of a statute, “we look first\nto its language, giving the words used their ordinary\nmeaning.” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108\n(1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe provision of the Gonzalez Act at issue, §1089(e), has\ntwo components: an introductory clause and an operative\nclause. The introductory clause prefaces §1089(e) with\n“[f]or purposes of this section.” The operative clause in-\nstructs that 28 U. S. C. §2680(h), the FTCA’s intentional\ntort exception, “shall not apply to any cause of action\narising out of . . . negligent or wrongful” conduct taken “in\nthe performance of medical, dental or related health care\nfunctions.” §1089(e).\n   We set out below the parties’ dueling constructions of\n§1089(e). Levin reads §1089(e) to negate §2680(h) for\nbattery claims involving medical personnel of the armed\nforces and other specified agencies. He trains first on the\noperative clause of §1089(e), which contains this direc-\ntive: The intentional tort exception to the FTCA “shall not\napply” to claims alleging medical malpractice. But, he\npoints out, if left unqualified, the operative clause would\nexpose the United States to liability for medical malprac-\ntice committed by federal employees across all agencies.\nThe introductory clause, Levin maintains, supplies the\nqualification: It confines the operative clause to claims\ncovered by “this section,” i.e., claims alleging malpractice\nby personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies\nspecified in the Gonzalez Act. Because Levin’s claim\nconcerning Dr. Bishop’s alleged battery fits that category,\n10                   LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nLevin concludes, he may sue to recover from the United\nStates.\n   The Government, in contrast, reads §1089(e)’s introduc-\ntory clause as instructing courts to pretend, “[f]or purposes\nof ” the Gonzalez Act, that §2680(h) does not secure the\nGovernment against liability for intentional torts, includ-\ning battery, even though §2680(h) does provide that shel-\nter. Congress included this counterfactual instruction in\nthe Gonzalez Act, the Government successfully argued in\nthe Ninth Circuit, “to guard against the negative inference\nthat, if no remedy against the United States were availa-\nble for a medical battery claim, a remedy against an indi-\nvidual defendant must exist.” Brief for United States 8.\nWarding off this mistaken inference, the Government\nasserts, §1089(e) eliminates any doubt that the military\nmedical personnel covered by §1089(a) are personally\nimmune from malpractice liability. Ensuring that immun-\nity, the Government reminds us, was the very purpose of\nthe Gonzalez Act.\n   The choice between these alternative readings of\n§1089(e) is not difficult to make. Section §1089(e)’s opera-\ntive clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the inten-\ntional tort exception to the FTCA, §2680(h), “shall not\napply,” and §1089(e)’s introductory clause confines the\nabrogation of §2680(h) to medical personnel employed by\nthe agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act.6\n   The Government invites us to read the phrase “section\n2680(h) . . . shall not apply,” to convey “§2680(h) does\napply,” a reading most unnatural. Had Congress wanted\nto guard against any inference that individual employees\nmay be liable, despite §1089(a)’s statement that the\n——————\n  6 Corroborating this plain reading, the Senate Report on the Gonzalez\n\nAct explains that §1089(e) was enacted to “nullify a provision of the\nFederal Tort Claims Act which would otherwise exclude any action for\nassault and battery” from FTCA coverage.

See, e.g., 7\nU. S. C. §7283(b) (“For purposes of this section, raw cane\nsugar, refined beet sugar, and in-process sugar eligible for\na loan . . . shall not be considered an agricultural commod-\nity.”); 15 U. S. C. §78o–11(e)(3)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (“For\npurposes of this subsection, the Federal National Mort-\ngage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Cor-\nporation, and the Federal home loan banks shall not be\nconsidered an agency of the United States.”); 42 U. S. C.\n§416(b) (“For purposes of subparagraph (C) of section\n402(b)(1) of this title, a divorced wife shall be deemed not\nto be married throughout the month in which she becomes\ndivorced.”).\n   We note, furthermore, that in 10 U. S. C. §1089(c), a\nsubsection of the Gonzalez Act adjacent to §1089(e), Con-\ngress used the counterfactual formulation absent in\n§1089(e). Section 1089(c) provides that certain actions\nbrought against military employees acting within the\nscope of their employment “shall be . . . deemed a tort\naction brought against the United States under the provi-\nsions of title 28.” See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534\nU. S. 438, 452 (2002) (“[W]hen Congress includes particu-\nlar language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n                         B\n  Were we to accept the Government’s interpretation of\n12                LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§1089(e), the Liability Reform Act would displace much of\nthe Gonzalez Act. To explain why this is so, we describe\nthe situation before the Court in United States v. Smith,\n499 U. S. 160. Smith presented the question whether\npersons injured abroad due to a military doctor’s negli-\ngence may seek compensation in a U. S. court from the\ndoctor who caused the injury. Because the FTCA excludes\nfrom the Government’s waiver of immunity “[a]ny claim\narising in a foreign country,” 28 U. S. C. §2680(k), the\nplaintiffs in Smith had no remedy against the United\nStates. They also lacked recourse to a suit in this country\nagainst the doctor, the Government urged, for the Liability\nReform Act made “[t]he remedy against the United States”\nunder the FTCA “exclusive of any other civil action.”\n§2679(b)(1). Were that the case, the plaintiffs responded,\nthe Liability Reform Act would effectively repeal the\nGonzalez Act. See Brief for Respondents in Smith, O. T.\n1990, No. 89–1646, pp. 33–46. In particular, they ob-\nserved, 10 U. S. C. §1089(f)(1) authorizes the head of an\nagency to indemnify military doctors “assigned to a foreign\ncountry” whose negligent conduct injures a patient. But\nthe indemnification provision would have no work to do,\nthe plaintiffs argued, if the Liability Reform Act foreclosed\nsuit against the doctor.\n   Not so, the Government responded. The Gonzalez Act\nwould continue to serve two important functions. First,\n§1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual\nmilitary doctors sued abroad where foreign law, rather\nthan the FTCA, might govern. Brief for United States in\nSmith 34 (citing Powers v. Schultz, 821 F. 2d 295, 297–298\n(CA5 1987)). Second, the Gonzalez Act would allow an\nFTCA suit against the United States if the doctor’s mal-\npractice ranked as “intentional,” i.e., if he performed a\nprocedure to which the plaintiff did not consent. See Brief\nfor United States in Smith 32–34; Reply Brief in Smith 12\n(“[T]he provision of the Gonzalez Act waiving sovereign\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

C. §1089(e), will enable plaintiffs\nto pursue those claims against the United States.”). Thus,\nthe Government told this Court, “in view of the continued\nneed for the provisions of the Gonzalez Act even after the\nenactment of the [Liability] Reform Act, leaving that\nstatute on the books was an entirely sensible drafting\ndecision.” Id., at 13.\n   Adopting the Government’s construction of the Liability\nReform Act, we held in Smith that §2679(b)(1) grants all\nfederal employees, including medical personnel, immunity\nfor acts within the scope of their employment, even when\nan FTCA exception (such as §2680(k)) left the plaintiff\nwithout a remedy against the United States. 499 U. S., at\n166. Our decision in Smith was thus informed by the\nGovernment’s position that the Gonzalez Act would re-\nmain “ ‘an operative part of the integrated statutory\nscheme.’ ” Reply Brief in Smith 12 (quoting United States\nv. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988)).\n   The Government now disavows the reading of §1089(e)\nit advanced in Smith. See Brief for United States 24, n. 8.\nUnder its current reading, the Liability Reform Act does\nindeed override the Gonzalez Act save in two slim applica-\ntions: If a military doctor employed by the United States is\nsued in a foreign court, or is detailed to a non-federal\ninstitution, indemnification of the doctor under §1089(f)(1)\nwould remain possible. See id., at 26. Under Levin’s\nreading of §1089(e), the Gonzalez Act does just what the\nGovernment said that legislation did in briefing Smith:\nIt renders §2680(h) inapplicable to medical batteries\ncommitted by military personnel within the scope of their\nemployment, thereby permitting civil actions against the\nUnited States by persons situated as Levin is.\n                          C\n  Endeavoring to inject ambiguity into §1089(e) notwith-\n14                  LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstanding its direction that “section 2680(h) . . . shall not\napply,” the Government refers to 38 U. S. C. §7316, a\nparallel statute that confers immunity on medical person-\nnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As enacted\nin 1965, §7316’s statutory predecessor had no provision\nakin to §1089(e). See 79 Stat. 1156, 38 U. S. C. §4116\n(1970 ed.). Congress added such a provision in 1988, but it\nwas not a carbon copy of §1089(e). In particular, the new\nprovision did not include the words that preface §1089(e).\nIt reads: “The exception provided in section 2680(h) of title\n28 shall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent\nor wrongful act or omission of any person described in\nsubsection (a) of this section in furnishing medical care or\ntreatment.” 38 U. S. C. §7316(f). This phrasing, which\nrefers to “any person described in [§7316(a)]”—i.e., any\n“health care employee of the” VA—does indeed express\nCongress’ intent to abrogate §2680(h), the Government\nacknowledges. But §7316(f) does so, the Government\nadds, with the unmistakable clarity the Gonzalez Act\nlacks.\n   We see nothing dispositively different about the word-\ning of the two provisions.7 Neither did the Government\nearlier on. In the District Court, the Government argued\nthat §1089(e) and §7316(f) are functionally indistinguish-\nable. See Record 366 (“§1089(e) has language that is\nidentical to . . . §7316(f)”); id., at 435 (“originally [Levin]\ntalked about the doctor being under the VA; in fact, the\ndoctor is a Navy doctor, but the statute is exactly the\nsame”); id., at 447–448 (Dr. Bishop was “[n]ot an employee\nof the VA[,] . . . [but] it’s an academic argument because\nthe exact same language [appears in] §1089(e)”). We agree\nwith the Government’s earlier view, and not with the\nfreshly minted revision.\n——————\n  7 See S.

UNITED STATES ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11–1351. Argued January 15, 2013—Decided March 4, 2013\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Government’s sover-\n  eign immunity from tort suits, 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1), but excepts\n  from the waiver certain intentional torts, including battery, §2680(h).\n  The FTCA, as originally enacted, afforded tort victims a remedy\n  against the United States, but did not preclude suit against the al-\n  leged tortfeasor as sole or joint defendant. Several agency-specific\n  statutes postdating the FTCA, however, immunized certain federal\n  employees from personal liability for torts committed in the course of\n  their official duties. One such statute, the Gonzalez Act, makes the\n  remedy against the United States under the FTCA preclusive of any\n  suit against armed forces medical personnel. 10 U. S. C. §1089(a).\n  The Act also provides that, “[f]or purposes of this section,” the inten-\n  tional tort exception to the FTCA “shall not apply to any cause of ac-\n  tion arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the per-\n  formance of medical . . . functions.” §1089(e). Congress subsequently\n  enacted comprehensive legislation, the Federal Employees Liability\n  Reform and Tort Compensation Act (Liability Reform Act), which\n  makes the FTCA’s remedy against the United States exclusive for\n  torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their\n  employment, 28 U. S. C. §2679(b)(1). Under the Liability Reform Act,\n  federal employees are shielded without regard to agency affiliation or\n  line of work.\n     Petitioner Levin suffered injuries as a result of cataract surgery\n  performed at a U. S. Naval Hospital. He filed suit, naming the United\n  States and the surgeon as defendants and asserting, inter alia, a\n  claim of battery, based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to oper-\n  ate shortly before the surgery took place. Finding that the surgeon\n  had acted within the scope of his employment, the District Court re-\n2                      LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    leased him and substituted the United States as sole defendant. The\n    Government moved to dismiss the battery claim, relying on the\n    FTCA’s intentional tort exception. Levin countered that the Gonza-\n    lez Act, in particular, §1089(e), renders that exception inapplicable\n    when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by a military physician. The\n    District Court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss. Affirm-\n    ing, the Ninth Circuit concluded that §1089(e) served only to buttress\n    the immunity from personal liability granted military medical per-\n    sonnel in §1089(a), and did not negate the FTCA’s intentional tort ex-\n    ception.\nHeld: The Gonzalez Act direction in §1089(e) abrogates the FTCA’s in-\n tentional tort exception and therefore permits Levin’s suit against\n the United States alleging medical battery by a Navy doctor acting\n within the scope of his employment. Pp. 8–15.\n    (a) To determine whether the Government’s immunity is waived for\n batteries, the Court looks to §1089(e)’s language, “giving the ‘words\n used’ their ‘ordinary meaning.’ ” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S.\n 103, 108. Levin claims that the operative clause of §1089(e), which\n provides that the FTCA’s intentional tort exception “shall not apply”\n to medical malpractice claims, is qualified by the provision’s intro-\n ductory clause “[f]or purposes of this section,” which confines the op-\n erative clause to claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the\n armed forces and the other agencies specified in the Gonzalez Act.\n The Government, in contrast, argues that §1089(e)’s introductory\n clause instructs courts to pretend, “[f]or purposes of” the Gonzalez\n Act, that §2680(h) does not secure the Government against liability\n for intentional torts, including battery, even though §2680(h) does\n provide that shelter. The choice between the parties’ dueling con-\n structions is not a difficult one. Section 1089(e)’s operative clause\n states, in no uncertain terms, that the FTCA’s intentional tort excep-\n tion, §2680(h), “shall not apply,” and §1089(e)’s introductory clause\n confines the abrogation of §2680(h) to medical personnel employed by\n the agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act. Had Congress wanted to\n adopt the Government’s counterfactual interpretation, it could have\n used more precise language, as it did in §1089(c), a subsection adja-\n cent to §1089(e). Pp. 8–11.\n    (b) Under the Government’s interpretation of §1089(e), the Liabil-\n ity Reform Act would displace much of the Gonzalez Act. That read-\n ing conflicts with the view the Government stated in United States v.\n Smith, 499 U. S. 160. There, the question was whether a person in-\n jured abroad due to a military doctor’s negligence may seek compen-\n sation from the doctor in a U. S. court, for the FTCA gave them no re-\n course against the Government on a “claim arising in a foreign\n country,” 28 U. S. C. §2680(k). In arguing that such persons also\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n  lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor, the Government con-\n  tended that the Liability Reform Act made “[t]he remedy against the\n  United States” under the FTCA “exclusive.” §2679(b)(1). This inter-\n  pretation, the Government argued, would not override the Gonzalez\n  Act, which would continue to serve two important functions: Title 10\n  U. S. C. §1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual\n  military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern; and\n  the Gonzalez Act would allow an FTCA suit against the United\n  States if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did\n  not consent. Adopting the Government’s construction, the Court held\n  that §2679(b)(1) grants all federal employees, including medical per-\n  sonnel, immunity for acts within the scope of their employment, even\n  when the FTCA provides no remedy against the United States. 499\n  U. S., at 166. Under the Government’s current reading of §1089(e),\n  the Liability Reform Act overrides the Gonzalez Act except in the\n  atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under\n  §1089(f)(1) remains possible, while under Levin’s reading, the Gonza-\n  lez Act does just what the Government said it did in Smith. Pp. 11–\n  13.\n    (c) The Government attempts to inject ambiguity into §1089(e) by\n  claiming that 38 U. S. C. §7316, a parallel statute that confers im-\n  munity on medical personnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs,\n  expresses Congress’ intent to abrogate §2680(h) with the unmistaka-\n  ble clarity the Gonzalez Act lacks. But this Court sees nothing dis-\n  positively different about the wording of the two provisions, and nei-\n  ther did the Government when it argued in the District Court that\n  §1089(e) and §7316(f) are functionally indistinguishable.

S.\nNaval Hospital in Guam. He asserts that, just prior to the\noperation, concern about equipment in the operating room\nled him to withdraw his consent to the surgery. Seeking\ncompensation from the United States, Levin sued under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. §§1346(b),\n2671–2680, which waives the Government’s sovereign\nimmunity from tort suits, but excepts from the waiver\ncertain intentional torts, including battery, §2680(h).\nLevin relied on the Gonzalez Act, 10 U. S. C. §1089, which\nmakes the remedy against the United States under the\nFTCA preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical\npersonnel, §1089(a). In the provision at issue in this case,\n§1089(e), the Gonzalez Act declares that, “[f]or purposes\nof ” the Act, the intentional tort exception to the FTCA\n“shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a\nnegligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance\nof medical . . . functions.”\n——————\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins this opinion, except as to footnotes 6 and 7.\n2                         LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                              Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government reads §1089(e) simply to shore up\n§1089(a)’s immunization of medical personnel against tort\nliability. Levin, in contrast, reads §1089(e) to establish\nhis right to bring a claim of medical battery against the\nUnited States under the FTCA without encountering the\nintentional tort exception. The U. S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Guam, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, dismissed\nLevin’s battery claim based on the reading of the Gonzalez\nAct proffered by the Government. We find the Govern-\nment’s reading strained, and Levin’s, far more compatible\nwith the text and purpose of the federal legislation. We\ntherefore reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   The FTCA, enacted in 1946, “was designed primarily to\nremove the sovereign immunity of the United States from\nsuits in tort.” Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 6\n(1962). The Act gives federal district courts exclusive\njurisdiction over claims against the United States for\n“injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission” of\nfederal employees acting within the scope of their em-\nployment. 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1). Substantively, the\nFTCA makes the United States liable “to the same extent\nas a private individual under like circumstances,” §2674,\nunder the law of the place where the tort occurred,\n§1346(b)(1), subject to enumerated exceptions to the im-\nmunity waiver, §§2680(a)–(n). The exception relevant in\nthis case is §2680(h), which, inter alia, preserves the\nGovernment’s immunity from suit on “[a]ny claim arising\nout of . . . battery.” We have referred to §2680(h) as the\n“intentional tort exception.” E.g., United States v. Shearer,\n473 U. S. 52, 54 (1985).1\n——————\n    1 This   shorthand description is not entirely accurate. Section 2680(h)\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Originally, the FTCA afforded tort victims a remedy\nagainst the United States, but did not preclude lawsuits\nagainst individual tortfeasors. See Henderson v. Blue-\nmink, 511 F. 2d 399, 404 (CADC 1974). Judgment against\nthe United States in an FTCA action would bar a sub-\nsequent action against the federal employee whose\nconduct gave rise to the claim, 28 U. S. C. §2676, but\nplaintiffs were not obliged to proceed exclusively against\nthe Government. They could sue as sole or joint defend-\nants federal employees alleged to have acted tortiously in\nthe course of performing their official duties.\n  In time, Congress enacted a series of agency-specific\nstatutes designed to shield precisely drawn classes of\nemployees from the threat of personal liability. United\nStates v. Smith, 499 U. S. 160, 170 (1991). One such\nmeasure was the Medical Malpractice Immunity Act, 90\nStat. 1985, 10 U. S. C. §1089, passed in 1976 and com-\nmonly known as the Gonzalez Act.2 That Act, controlling in\n——————\ndoes not remove from the FTCA’s waiver all intentional torts, e.g.,\nconversion and trespass, and it encompasses certain torts, e.g., misrep-\nresentation, that may arise out of negligent conduct. See United States\nv. Neustadt, 366 U. S. 696, 702 (1961).\n   2 The agency-specific statutes were patterned on the Federal Drivers\n\nAct, 75 Stat. 539, 28 U. S. C. §§2679(b)–(e) (1970 ed.), passed in 1961\nand amended in 1988 by Pub. L. 100–694, §5(b), 102 Stat. 4564. The\nDrivers Act made an action against the United States under the FTCA\nthe “exclusive” remedy for “personal injury . . . resulting from the\noperation by any employee of the Government of any motor vehicle\nwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.” §2679(b).\nStatutes conferring immunity on medical personnel of the Department\nof Veterans Affairs, 79 Stat. 1156, 38 U. S. C. §4116 (1970 ed.), now\ncodified at 38 U. S. C. §7316 (2006 ed.), and the Public Health Service,\n84 Stat. 1870, 42 U. S. C. §233 (2006 ed.), followed in 1965 and 1970,\nrespectively. In 1976, in addition to the Gonzalez Act, Congress enact-\ned a statute immunizing medical personnel of the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration, 90 Stat. 1988, 42 U. S. C. §2458a (1982 ed.),\nnow codified at 51 U. S. C. §20137 (2006 ed., Supp. IV). And in 1980, it\nenacted a personal immunity statute covering medical personnel of the\nDepartment of State, 94 Stat. 2155, 22 U. S. C. §2702 (2006 ed.).\n4                     LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthis case, makes claims against the United States under\nthe FTCA the “exclusive” remedy for injuries resulting\nfrom malpractice committed by medical personnel of the\narmed forces and other specified agencies. 10 U. S. C.\n§1089(a).3\n   A subsection of the Gonzalez Act key to the issue before\nus, §1089(e), refers to the FTCA’s intentional tort excep-\ntion. It provides: “For purposes of this section, the provi-\nsions of section 2680(h) of title 28 shall not apply to any\ncause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or\nomission in the performance of medical, dental, or related\nhealth care functions.” Section 1089(e) was patterned on a\nprovision in a statute, enacted six years earlier, that\nconferred immunity on medical personnel of the Public\nHealth Service. See 84 Stat. 1870, 42 U. S. C. §233(e)\n(1976 ed.) (“For purposes of this section, the provisions of\n[§2680(h)] shall not apply to assault or battery arising out\nof negligence in the performance of medical . . . func-\n\n——————\n    3 In\n       full, §1089(a) reads:\n   “The remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b)\nand 2672 of title 28 for damages for personal injury, including death,\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any physician,\ndentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting person-\nnel (including medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and\ntherapists) of the armed forces, the National Guard while engaged in\ntraining or duty under section 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 of title 32, the\nDepartment of Defense, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, or the\nCentral Intelligence Agency in the performance of medical, dental, or\nrelated health care functions (including clinical studies and investiga-\ntions) while acting within the scope of his duties or employment therein\nor therefor shall hereafter be exclusive of any other civil action or\nproceeding by reason of the same subject matter against such physi-\ncian, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting\npersonnel (or the estate of such person) whose act or omission gave rise\nto such action or proceeding. This subsection shall also apply if the\nphysician, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other support-\ning personnel (or the estate of such person) involved is serving under a\npersonal services contract entered into under section 1091 of this title.”\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntions.”). Targeted immunity statutes enacted around the\nsame time as the Gonzalez Act similarly shielded medical\npersonnel employed by specific agencies. See supra, at 3,\nn. 2. Each such measure contained a provision resembling\n§1089(e). See 22 U. S. C. §2702(e) (“For purposes of this\nsection, the provisions of [§2680(h)], shall not apply to any\ntort enumerated therein arising out of negligence in the\nfurnishing of medical care or related services.”); 38\nU. S. C. §7316(f) (“The exception provided in [§2680(h)]\nshall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent or\nwrongful act or omission of any person described in sub-\nsection (a) in furnishing medical care or treatment . . .\nwhile in the exercise of such person’s duties in or for the\nAdministration.”); 51 U. S. C. §20137(e) (“For purposes of\nthis section, the provisions of [§2680(h)] shall not apply to\nany cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrong-\nful act or omission in the performance of medical . . .\nfunctions.”).\n   In 1988, departing from the above-described agency-\nspecific approach, Congress enacted comprehensive legis-\nlation titled the Federal Employees Liability Reform and\nTort Compensation Act (Liability Reform Act), 102 Stat.\n4563, and often called the Westfall Act. This embracive\nmeasure makes the remedy against the United States\nunder the FTCA exclusive for torts committed by federal\nemployees acting within the scope of their employment, 28\nU. S. C. §2679(b)(1). Shielding all federal employees from\npersonal liability without regard to agency affiliation or\nline of work, the personal immunity provision of the Lia-\nbility Reform Act tracks the text of §1089(a). The compre-\nhensive enactment, however, did not repeal the Gonzalez\nAct, Smith, 499 U. S., at 172, or, presumably, any of the\nother laws covering medical personnel employed at partic-\nular agencies. Unlike the Gonzalez Act and kindred stat-\nutes, the Liability Reform Act does not reference, as\n§1089(e) does, the FTCA’s intentional tort exception, 28\n6                    LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. §2680(h).\n                               B\n   The petitioner, Steven Alan Levin, a veteran, was diag-\nnosed with a cataract in his right eye. He sought treat-\nment at the United States Naval Hospital in Guam and\nwas evaluated by Lieutenant Commander Frank Bishop,\nM. D., an ophthalmologist serving in the U. S. Navy. Dr.\nBishop recommended that Levin undergo “phacoemulsifi-\ncation with intraocular lens placement,” a surgical proce-\ndure involving extraction of the cataract and insertion of\nan artificial replacement lens. Levin signed forms con-\nsenting to the operation, which took place on March 12,\n2003. Shortly before the surgery began, Levin alleges, he\norally withdrew his consent twice, but Dr. Bishop con-\nducted the operation nevertheless. Due to complications oc-\ncurring while the surgery was underway, Levin developed\ncorneal edema, a condition that left him with diminished\neyesight, discomfort, problems with glare and depth-of-\nfield vision, and in need of ongoing medical treatment.\n   Levin sought compensation for the untoward results of\nthe surgery. After exhausting administrative remedies,\nhe commenced a civil action in the U. S. District Court for\nthe District of Guam. Naming the United States and Dr.\nBishop as defendants, Levin asserted claims of battery,\nbased on his alleged withdrawal of consent to the surgery,\nand negligence, based on alleged flaws in Dr. Bishop’s\nperformance of the operation. Accepting the Government’s\nrepresentation that Dr. Bishop was acting within the\nscope of his employment while performing the surgery, the\nDistrict Court granted the Government’s motion to release\nDr. Bishop and substitute the United States as sole de-\nfendant. When Levin failed to produce expert testimony\nin support of his negligence allegations, the court granted\nthe Government’s motion for summary judgment on that\nclaim.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Next, the Government moved to dismiss the battery\nclaim. The District Court no longer had jurisdiction over\nLevin’s case, the Government argued, because the FTCA’s\nintentional tort exception, §2680(h), disallows suits\nagainst the United States for battery. Levin countered\nthat the Gonzalez Act, in particular, §1089(e), renders the\nintentional tort exception inapplicable when a plaintiff\nalleges medical battery by an armed forces physician. The\nDistrict Court rejected Levin’s plea and granted the Gov-\nernment’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a–41a.\n  On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, Levin did not question\nthe adverse judgment on his negligent performance claim,\nbut he renewed the argument that the battery claim,\nbased on his alleged withdrawal of consent, survived.\nThat was so, he maintained, because §1089(e) negated\n§2680(h), the FTCA’s intentional tort exception. The\nCourt of Appeals thought Levin’s construction of the Gon-\nzalez Act “plausible,” but “not the best reading of the\nstatute.” 663 F. 3d 1059, 1062 (2011). As perceived by the\nNinth Circuit, §1089(e) had a limited office, serving only to\nbuttress the immunity from personal liability granted\nmilitary medical personnel in §1089(a). “[C]lever tort\nplaintiffs,” the court conjectured, might argue in future\ncases that because the FTCA does not authorize battery\nclaims against the United States, such claims may be\nasserted against military doctors notwithstanding\n§1089(a). Ibid. Section 1089(e) foreclosed that argument,\nbut the provision did nothing more, the court concluded.\nSatisfied that §1089(e) served the dominant purpose of the\nGonzalez Act—to immunize covered medical personnel\nagainst malpractice liability—and did not unequivocally\nwaive the United States’ sovereign immunity from battery\nclaims, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s\n8                    LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndisposition.4\n   We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), recognizing\nthat Courts of Appeals have divided on the question\nwhether the controlling provision of the Gonzalez Act,\n§1089(e), authorizes battery claims against the United\nStates when military doctors operate without the patient’s\nconsent. Compare 663 F. 3d, at 1063 (case below), with\nKeir v. United States, 853 F. 2d 398, 409–410 (CA6 1988)\n(§1089(e) waives sovereign immunity for battery suits\nalleging malpractice by military medical personnel); and\nLojuk v. Quandt, 706 F. 2d 1456, 1463 (CA7 1983) (same).\nSee also Franklin v. United States, 992 F. 2d 1492, 1501\n(CA10 1993) (38 U. S. C. §7316(f), concerning Department\nof Veterans Affairs’ medical personnel, includes an “es-\nsentially identical counterpart” to §1089(e), which sim-\nilarly “nullif[ies] §2680(h) and thereby expand[s] the\ninjured party’s remedy against the government under the\nFTCA”).5\n                            II\n                             A\n    We note at the outset that medical malpractice claims\n——————\n  4 In accord with the Ninth Circuit, the Government maintains that\n\nsovereign immunity is never waived absent unequivocal congressional\nstatement to that effect. See Brief for United States 14–15 (citing FAA\nv. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5)); United States v.\nBormes, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 4). Levin, on the other\nhand, urges that, in view of the FTCA’s sweeping waiver of immunity,\n§1346(b)(1), exceptions to that waiver, contained in §2680, should not\nbe accorded an unduly generous interpretation. See Brief for Court-\nAppointed Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioner 40 (citing Dolan v.\nPostal Service, 546 U. S. 481, 492 (2006)). We need not settle this\ndispute. For the reasons stated, infra this page and 9–14, we conclude\nthat §1089(e) meets the unequivocal waiver standard.\n  5 We appointed James A. Feldman to brief and argue the position of\n\nthe petitioner as amicus curiae. 568 U. S. ___ (2012). Amicus Feldman\nhas ably discharged his assigned responsibilities and the Court thanks\nhim for his well stated arguments.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay be based on negligence, in which case the FTCA’s\nwaiver of the Government’s sovereign immunity is not in\ndoubt. See 28 U. S. C. §1346(b)(1); supra, at 2. Or they\nmay be based on alleged lack of consent, therefore qualify-\ning as batteries. Whether the Government’s immunity is\nwaived for such claims depends on the meaning of 10\nU. S. C. §1089(e). See supra, at 4.\n   In determining the meaning of a statute, “we look first\nto its language, giving the words used their ordinary\nmeaning.” Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108\n(1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe provision of the Gonzalez Act at issue, §1089(e), has\ntwo components: an introductory clause and an operative\nclause. The introductory clause prefaces §1089(e) with\n“[f]or purposes of this section.” The operative clause in-\nstructs that 28 U. S. C. §2680(h), the FTCA’s intentional\ntort exception, “shall not apply to any cause of action\narising out of . . . negligent or wrongful” conduct taken “in\nthe performance of medical, dental or related health care\nfunctions.” §1089(e).\n   We set out below the parties’ dueling constructions of\n§1089(e). Levin reads §1089(e) to negate §2680(h) for\nbattery claims involving medical personnel of the armed\nforces and other specified agencies. He trains first on the\noperative clause of §1089(e), which contains this direc-\ntive: The intentional tort exception to the FTCA “shall not\napply” to claims alleging medical malpractice. But, he\npoints out, if left unqualified, the operative clause would\nexpose the United States to liability for medical malprac-\ntice committed by federal employees across all agencies.\nThe introductory clause, Levin maintains, supplies the\nqualification: It confines the operative clause to claims\ncovered by “this section,” i.e., claims alleging malpractice\nby personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies\nspecified in the Gonzalez Act. Because Levin’s claim\nconcerning Dr. Bishop’s alleged battery fits that category,\n10                   LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nLevin concludes, he may sue to recover from the United\nStates.\n   The Government, in contrast, reads §1089(e)’s introduc-\ntory clause as instructing courts to pretend, “[f]or purposes\nof ” the Gonzalez Act, that §2680(h) does not secure the\nGovernment against liability for intentional torts, includ-\ning battery, even though §2680(h) does provide that shel-\nter. Congress included this counterfactual instruction in\nthe Gonzalez Act, the Government successfully argued in\nthe Ninth Circuit, “to guard against the negative inference\nthat, if no remedy against the United States were availa-\nble for a medical battery claim, a remedy against an indi-\nvidual defendant must exist.” Brief for United States 8.\nWarding off this mistaken inference, the Government\nasserts, §1089(e) eliminates any doubt that the military\nmedical personnel covered by §1089(a) are personally\nimmune from malpractice liability. Ensuring that immun-\nity, the Government reminds us, was the very purpose of\nthe Gonzalez Act.\n   The choice between these alternative readings of\n§1089(e) is not difficult to make. Section §1089(e)’s opera-\ntive clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the inten-\ntional tort exception to the FTCA, §2680(h), “shall not\napply,” and §1089(e)’s introductory clause confines the\nabrogation of §2680(h) to medical personnel employed by\nthe agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act.6\n   The Government invites us to read the phrase “section\n2680(h) . . . shall not apply,” to convey “§2680(h) does\napply,” a reading most unnatural. Had Congress wanted\nto guard against any inference that individual employees\nmay be liable, despite §1089(a)’s statement that the\n——————\n  6 Corroborating this plain reading, the Senate Report on the Gonzalez\n\nAct explains that §1089(e) was enacted to “nullify a provision of the\nFederal Tort Claims Act which would otherwise exclude any action for\nassault and battery” from FTCA coverage. S. Rep. No. 94–1264, p. 9\n(1976).\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nremedy against the United States is exclusive, see supra, at 4,\nn. 3, Congress might have stated, “subsection (a) applies\neven when §2680(h) precludes recovery against the United\nStates under the FTCA.” Or, Congress might have pro-\nvided that §2680(h) shall be “deemed” or “considered”\ninapplicable, a formulation commonly employed to direct\ncourts to make counterfactual assumptions. See, e.g., 7\nU. S. C. §7283(b) (“For purposes of this section, raw cane\nsugar, refined beet sugar, and in-process sugar eligible for\na loan . . . shall not be considered an agricultural commod-\nity.”); 15 U. S. C. §78o–11(e)(3)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (“For\npurposes of this subsection, the Federal National Mort-\ngage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Cor-\nporation, and the Federal home loan banks shall not be\nconsidered an agency of the United States.”); 42 U. S. C.\n§416(b) (“For purposes of subparagraph (C) of section\n402(b)(1) of this title, a divorced wife shall be deemed not\nto be married throughout the month in which she becomes\ndivorced.”).\n   We note, furthermore, that in 10 U. S. C. §1089(c), a\nsubsection of the Gonzalez Act adjacent to §1089(e), Con-\ngress used the counterfactual formulation absent in\n§1089(e). Section 1089(c) provides that certain actions\nbrought against military employees acting within the\nscope of their employment “shall be . . . deemed a tort\naction brought against the United States under the provi-\nsions of title 28.” See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534\nU. S. 438, 452 (2002) (“[W]hen Congress includes particu-\nlar language in one section of a statute but omits it in\nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed\nthat Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the\ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n                         B\n  Were we to accept the Government’s interpretation of\n12                LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n§1089(e), the Liability Reform Act would displace much of\nthe Gonzalez Act. To explain why this is so, we describe\nthe situation before the Court in United States v. Smith,\n499 U. S. 160. Smith presented the question whether\npersons injured abroad due to a military doctor’s negli-\ngence may seek compensation in a U. S. court from the\ndoctor who caused the injury. Because the FTCA excludes\nfrom the Government’s waiver of immunity “[a]ny claim\narising in a foreign country,” 28 U. S. C. §2680(k), the\nplaintiffs in Smith had no remedy against the United\nStates. They also lacked recourse to a suit in this country\nagainst the doctor, the Government urged, for the Liability\nReform Act made “[t]he remedy against the United States”\nunder the FTCA “exclusive of any other civil action.”\n§2679(b)(1). Were that the case, the plaintiffs responded,\nthe Liability Reform Act would effectively repeal the\nGonzalez Act. See Brief for Respondents in Smith, O. T.\n1990, No. 89–1646, pp. 33–46. In particular, they ob-\nserved, 10 U. S. C. §1089(f)(1) authorizes the head of an\nagency to indemnify military doctors “assigned to a foreign\ncountry” whose negligent conduct injures a patient. But\nthe indemnification provision would have no work to do,\nthe plaintiffs argued, if the Liability Reform Act foreclosed\nsuit against the doctor.\n   Not so, the Government responded. The Gonzalez Act\nwould continue to serve two important functions. First,\n§1089(f)(1) would authorize indemnification of individual\nmilitary doctors sued abroad where foreign law, rather\nthan the FTCA, might govern. Brief for United States in\nSmith 34 (citing Powers v. Schultz, 821 F. 2d 295, 297–298\n(CA5 1987)). Second, the Gonzalez Act would allow an\nFTCA suit against the United States if the doctor’s mal-\npractice ranked as “intentional,” i.e., if he performed a\nprocedure to which the plaintiff did not consent. See Brief\nfor United States in Smith 32–34; Reply Brief in Smith 12\n(“[T]he provision of the Gonzalez Act waiving sovereign\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Thus,\nthe Government told this Court, “in view of the continued\nneed for the provisions of the Gonzalez Act even after the\nenactment of the [Liability] Reform Act, leaving that\nstatute on the books was an entirely sensible drafting\ndecision.” Id., at 13.\n   Adopting the Government’s construction of the Liability\nReform Act, we held in Smith that §2679(b)(1) grants all\nfederal employees, including medical personnel, immunity\nfor acts within the scope of their employment, even when\nan FTCA exception (such as §2680(k)) left the plaintiff\nwithout a remedy against the United States. 499 U. S., at\n166. Our decision in Smith was thus informed by the\nGovernment’s position that the Gonzalez Act would re-\nmain “ ‘an operative part of the integrated statutory\nscheme.’ ” Reply Brief in Smith 12 (quoting United States\nv. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 453 (1988)).\n   The Government now disavows the reading of §1089(e)\nit advanced in Smith. See Brief for United States 24, n. 8.\nUnder its current reading, the Liability Reform Act does\nindeed override the Gonzalez Act save in two slim applica-\ntions: If a military doctor employed by the United States is\nsued in a foreign court, or is detailed to a non-federal\ninstitution, indemnification of the doctor under §1089(f)(1)\nwould remain possible. See id., at 26. Under Levin’s\nreading of §1089(e), the Gonzalez Act does just what the\nGovernment said that legislation did in briefing Smith:\nIt renders §2680(h) inapplicable to medical batteries\ncommitted by military personnel within the scope of their\nemployment, thereby permitting civil actions against the\nUnited States by persons situated as Levin is.\n                          C\n  Endeavoring to inject ambiguity into §1089(e) notwith-\n14                  LEVIN v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstanding its direction that “section 2680(h) . . . shall not\napply,” the Government refers to 38 U. S. C. §7316, a\nparallel statute that confers immunity on medical person-\nnel of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As enacted\nin 1965, §7316’s statutory predecessor had no provision\nakin to §1089(e). See 79 Stat. 1156, 38 U. S. C. §4116\n(1970 ed.). Congress added such a provision in 1988, but it\nwas not a carbon copy of §1089(e). In particular, the new\nprovision did not include the words that preface §1089(e).\nIt reads: “The exception provided in section 2680(h) of title\n28 shall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent\nor wrongful act or omission of any person described in\nsubsection (a) of this section in furnishing medical care or\ntreatment.” 38 U. S. C. §7316(f). This phrasing, which\nrefers to “any person described in [§7316(a)]”—i.e., any\n“health care employee of the” VA—does indeed express\nCongress’ intent to abrogate §2680(h), the Government\nacknowledges. But §7316(f) does so, the Government\nadds, with the unmistakable clarity the Gonzalez Act\nlacks.\n   We see nothing dispositively different about the word-\ning of the two provisions.7 Neither did the Government\nearlier on. In the District Court, the Government argued\nthat §1089(e) and §7316(f) are functionally indistinguish-\nable. See Record 366 (“§1089(e) has language that is\nidentical to . . . §7316(f)”); id., at 435 (“originally [Levin]\ntalked about the doctor being under the VA; in fact, the\ndoctor is a Navy doctor, but the statute is exactly the\nsame”); id., at 447–448 (Dr. Bishop was “[n]ot an employee\nof the VA[,] . . . [but] it’s an academic argument because\nthe exact same language [appears in] §1089(e)”). We agree\nwith the Government’s earlier view, and not with the\nfreshly minted revision.\n——————\n  7 See S.
