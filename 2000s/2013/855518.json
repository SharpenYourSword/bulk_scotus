JOHN WILEY\n                 & SONS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11–697.      Argued October 29, 2012—Decided March 19, 2013\nThe “exclusive rights” that a copyright owner has “to distribute copies\n  . . . of [a] copyrighted work,” 17 U. S. C. §106(3), are qualified by the\n  application of several limitations set out in §§107 through 122, in-\n  cluding the “first sale” doctrine, which provides that “the owner of a\n  particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is\n  entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or oth-\n  erwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord,” §109(a).\n  Importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owner’s permis-\n  sion is an infringement of §106(3). See §602(a)(1). In Quality King\n  Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research Int’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145,\n  this Court held that §602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3) incorporates the\n  §§107 through 122 limitations, including §109’s “first sale” doctrine.\n  However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the\n  United States and then sent abroad and sold.\n      Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., an academic textbook pub-\n  lisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley\n  Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wiley’s Eng-\n  lish language textbooks abroad. Wiley Asia’s books state that they\n  are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.\n  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States\n  to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edi-\n  tion English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold\n  at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States. He then\n  sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the\n  profit.\n      Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng’s unauthorized importa-\n  tion and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley’s §106(3)\n2             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    exclusive right to distribute and §602’s import prohibition. Kirtsaeng\n    replied that because his books were “lawfully made” and acquired le-\n    gitimately, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine permitted importation and\n    resale without Wiley’s further permission. The District Court held\n    that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine\n    does not apply to goods manufactured abroad. The jury then found\n    that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley’s American copyrights\n    and assessed damages. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n    §109(a)’s “lawfully made under this title” language indicated that the\n    “first sale” doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted\n    works manufactured abroad.\nHeld: The “first sale” doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work\n lawfully made abroad. Pp. 7–33.\n    (a) Wiley reads “lawfully made under this title” to impose a geo-\n graphical limitation that prevents §109(a)’s doctrine from applying to\n Wiley Asia’s books. Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as impos-\n ing the non-geographical limitation made “in accordance with” or “in\n compliance with” the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine\n to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner’s\n permission. Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Section 109(a)’s language, its context, and the “first sale” doc-\n trine’s common-law history favor Kirtsaeng’s reading. Pp. 8–24.\n      (1) Section 109(a) says nothing about geography. “Under” can\n logically mean “in accordance with.” And a nongeographical inter-\n pretation provides each word in the phrase “lawfully made under this\n title” with a distinct purpose: “lawfully made” suggests an effort to\n distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,\n and “under this title” sets forth the standard of “lawful[ness]” (i.e.,\n the U. S. Copyright Act). This simple reading promotes the tradi-\n tional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-\n word linguistic sense.\n    In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic\n difficulties. Wiley first reads “under” to mean “in conformance with\n the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.” Wiley then\n argues that the Act “is applicable” only in the United States. Howev-\n er, neither “under” nor any other word in “lawfully made under this\n title” means “where.” Nor can a geographical limitation be read into\n the word “applicable.” The fact that the Act does not instantly pro-\n tect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking\n place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made\n abroad. Indeed, §602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies sub-\n ject to the Copyright Act. And §104 says that works “subject to pro-\n tection” include unpublished works “without regard to the [author’s]\n nationality or domicile,” and works “first published” in any of the\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nnearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the\nUnited States. Pp. 8–12.\n     (2) Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate\nthat Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the pre-\nsent version of §109(a). A comparison of the language in §109(a)’s\npredecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion. The\nformer version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but\nmere possessors who “lawfully obtained” a copy, while the present\nversion covers only owners of a “lawfully made” copy. This new lan-\nguage, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who owns a copy\nwill be protected, provided that the copy was “lawfully made.” A\nnongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions\nof the present statute. For example, the “manufacturing clause,”\nwhich limited importation of many copies printed outside the United\nStates, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies\nmade in America and copies made abroad. But that “equal treat-\nment” principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpreta-\ntion that would grant an American copyright holder permanent con-\ntrol over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed\nabroad but not those printed in America. Finally, the Court normally\npresumes that the words “lawfully made under this title” carry the\nsame meaning when they appear in different but related sections,\nand it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the conse-\nquences produced by a geographical interpretation. Pp. 12–16.\n     (3) A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of\nstatutory interpretation that “when a statute covers an issue previ-\nously governed by the common law,” it is presumed that “Congress\nintended to retain the substance of the common law.” Samantar v.\nYousuf, 560 U. S. ___, ___. The common-law “first sale” doctrine,\nwhich has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical\ndistinctions. Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co.\nv. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, where this Court first applied the “first sale”\ndoctrine, or in §109(a)’s predecessor provision, which Congress enact-\ned a year later. Pp. 17–19.\n     (4) Library associations, used-book dealers, technology compa-\nnies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways\nin which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic\nconstitutional copyright objectives, in particular “promot[ing] the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts,” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. For example, a\ngeographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely re-\nquire libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books\nin their collections that were printed overseas. Wiley counters that\nsuch problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court\n4             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    first adopted a geographical interpretation. But the law has not been\n    settled for so long in Wiley’s favor. The Second Circuit in this case\n    was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical inter-\n    pretation. Reliance on the “first sale” doctrine is also deeply embed-\n    ded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers,\n    who have long relied on its protection. And the fact that harm has\n    proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright\n    holders to assert geographically based resale rights. Thus, the prac-\n    tical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,\n    extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant—\n    particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade\n    to America. Pp. 19–24.\n       (c) Several additional arguments that Wiley and the dissent make\n    in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants “the owner of\ncopyright under this title” certain “exclusive rights,”\nincluding the right “to distribute copies . . . of the copy­\nrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of\nownership.” 17 U. S. C. §106(3). These rights are quali­\nfied, however, by the application of various limitations set\nforth in the next several sections of the Act, §§107 through\n122. Those sections, typically entitled “Limitations on\nexclusive rights,” include, for example, the principle of\n“fair use” (§107), permission for limited library archival\nreproduction, (§108), and the doctrine at issue here, the\n“first sale” doctrine (§109).\n   Section 109(a) sets forth the “first sale” doctrine as\nfollows:\n    “Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3) [the\n    section that grants the owner exclusive distribution\n    rights], the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord\n    lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without\n    the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or other­\n    wise dispose of the possession of that copy or\n2          KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    phonorecord.” (Emphasis added.)\nThus, even though §106(3) forbids distribution of a copy of,\nsay, the copyrighted novel Herzog without the copyright\nowner’s permission, §109(a) adds that, once a copy of Her-\nzog has been lawfully sold (or its ownership otherwise\nlawfully transferred), the buyer of that copy and subse­\nquent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish. In\ncopyright jargon, the “first sale” has “exhausted” the\ncopyright owner’s §106(3) exclusive distribution right.\n   What, however, if the copy of Herzog was printed abroad\nand then initially sold with the copyright owner’s permis­\nsion? Does the “first sale” doctrine still apply? Is the\nbuyer, like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,\nfree to bring the copy into the United States and dispose of\nit as he or she wishes?\n   To put the matter technically, an “importation” provi­\nsion, §602(a)(1), says that\n    “[i]mportation into the United States, without the au­\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies . . . of a work that have been acquired outside\n    the United States is an infringement of the exclusive\n    right to distribute copies . . . under section 106 . . . .”\n    17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis\n    added).\n   Thus §602(a)(1) makes clear that importing a copy\nwithout permission violates the owner’s exclusive distri-\nbution right. But in doing so, §602(a)(1) refers explicitly to\nthe §106(3) exclusive distribution right. As we have just\nsaid, §106 is by its terms “[s]ubject to” the various doc­\ntrines and principles contained in §§107 through 122, in-\ncluding §109(a)’s “first sale” limitation. Do those same\nmodifications apply—in particular, does the “first sale”\nmodification apply—when considering whether §602(a)(1)\nprohibits importing a copy?\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInt’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145 (1998), we held that\n§602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3)’s exclusive distribution\nright incorporates the later subsections’ limitations, in­\ncluding, in particular, the “first sale” doctrine of §109.\nThus, it might seem that, §602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one\nwho buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into\nthe United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he\nbought the copy in the United States.\n  But Quality King considered an instance in which the\ncopy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufac­\ntured in the United States (and then sent abroad and\nsold). This case is like Quality King but for one important\nfact. The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.\nThat fact is important because §109(a) says that the “first\nsale” doctrine applies to “a particular copy or phonorecord\nlawfully made under this title.” And we must decide here\nwhether the five words, “lawfully made under this title,”\nmake a critical legal difference.\n  Putting section numbers to the side, we ask whether\nthe “first sale” doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other\nlawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully\nmanufactured abroad. Can that buyer bring that copy\ninto the United States (and sell it or give it away) without\nobtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner?\nCan, for example, someone who purchases, say at a used\nbookstore, a book printed abroad subsequently resell it\nwithout the copyright owner’s permission?\n  In our view, the answers to these questions are, yes. We\nhold that the “first sale” doctrine applies to copies of a\ncopyrighted work lawfully made abroad.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publishes aca-\ndemic textbooks. Wiley obtains from its authors various\nforeign and domestic copyright assignments, licenses and\n4         KIRTSAENG v.

See 654 F. 3d 210, 213, n. 6 (CA2 2011). Wiley\noften assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary, John\nWiley & Sons (Asia) Pte Ltd., rights to publish, print, and\nsell Wiley’s English language textbooks abroad. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 47a–48a. Each copy of a Wiley Asia foreign\nedition will likely contain language making clear that the\ncopy is to be sold only in a particular country or geograph­\nical region outside the United States. 654 F. 3d, at 213.\n  For example, a copy of Wiley’s American edition says,\n“Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights\nreserved. . . . Printed in the United States of America.”\nJ. Walker, Fundamentals of Physics, p. vi (8th ed. 2008).\nA copy of Wiley Asia’s Asian edition of that book says:\n    “Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Pte\n    Ltd[.] All rights reserved. This book is authorized for\n    sale in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East only\n    and may be not exported out of these territories. Ex­\n    portation from or importation of this book to another\n    region without the Publisher’s authorization is illegal\n    and is a violation of the Publisher’s rights.

Walker, Fundamentals of Physics,\n    p. vi (8th ed. 2008 Wiley Int’l Student ed.).\nBoth the foreign and the American copies say:\n    “No part of this publication may be reproduced, stored\n    in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any form or\n    by any means . . . except as permitted under Sections\n    107 or 108 of the 1976 United States Copyright Act.”\n    Compare, e.g., ibid. (Int’l ed.), with Walker, supra, at\n    vi (American ed.).\n  The upshot is that there are two essentially equivalent\nversions of a Wiley textbook, 654 F. 3d, at 213, each ver­\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

And Wiley makes certain that copies of the second\nversion state that they are not to be taken (without per­\nmission) into the United States.

Kirtsaeng successfully\ncompleted his undergraduate courses at Cornell, success­\nfully completed a Ph. D. program in mathematics at the\nUniversity of Southern California, and then, as promised,\nreturned to Thailand to teach. Ibid. While he was study­\ning in the United States, Kirtsaeng asked his friends and\nfamily in Thailand to buy copies of foreign edition English­\nlanguage textbooks at Thai book shops, where they sold at\nlow prices, and mail them to him in the United States.\nId., at 7–8.

S. C. §§106(3) (2006 ed.), 602(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V).\nSee also §501 (2006 ed.) (authorizing infringement action).\nApp. 204–211.

Thus, in his view, §109(a)’s “first\nsale” doctrine permitted him to resell or otherwise dispose\nof the books without the copyright owner’s further permis­\nsion. Id., at 2–3.\n   The District Court held that Kirtsaeng could not assert\nthe “first sale” defense because, in its view, that doctrine\ndoes not apply to “foreign-manufactured goods” (even if\nmade abroad with the copyright owner’s permission). App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 72a. The jury then found that Kirtsaeng\nhad willfully infringed Wiley’s American copyrights by\nselling and importing without authorization copies of eight\nof Wiley’s copyrighted titles. And it assessed statutory\ndamages of $600,000 ($75,000 per work). 654 F. 3d, at\n215.\n   On appeal, a split panel of the Second Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court. Id., at 222. It pointed out that\n§109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine applies only to “the owner of\na particular copy . . . lawfully made under this title.” Id.,\nat 218–219 (emphasis added). And, in the majority’s view,\nthis language means that the “first sale” doctrine does not\napply to copies of American copyrighted works manufac­\ntured abroad. Id., at 221. A dissenting judge thought that\nthe words “lawfully made under this title” do not refer “to\na place of manufacture” but rather “focu[s] on whether a\nparticular copy was manufactured lawfully under” Amer-\nica’s copyright statute, and that “the lawfulness of the\nmanufacture of a particular copy should be judged by U. S.\ncopyright law.” Id., at 226 (opinion of Murtha, J.).\n   We granted Kirtsaeng’s petition for certiorari to con-\nsider this question in light of different views among the\nCircuits.

The Second Circuit, the Ninth\nCircuit, Wiley, and the Solicitor General (as amicus) all\nread those words as imposing a form of geographical limi­\ntation. The Second Circuit held that they limit the “first\nsale” doctrine to particular copies “made in territories in\nwhich the Copyright Act is law,” which (the Circuit says)\nare copies “manufactured domestically,” not “outside of the\nUnited States.” 654 F. 3d, at 221–222 (emphasis added).\nWiley agrees that those five words limit the “first sale”\ndoctrine “to copies made in conformance with the [United\nStates] Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is appli­\ncable,” which (Wiley says) means it does not apply to copies\nmade “outside the United States” and at least not to “for­\neign production of a copy for distribution exclusively\nabroad.” Brief for Respondent 15–16. Similarly, the\nSolicitor General says that those five words limit the “first\nsale” doctrine’s applicability to copies “ ‘made subject to\nand in compliance with [the Copyright Act],’ ” which (the\nSolicitor General says) are copies “made in the United\nStates.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5\n(hereinafter Brief for United States) (emphasis added).\nAnd the Ninth Circuit has held that those words limit the\n“first sale” doctrine’s applicability (1) to copies lawfully\nmade in the United States, and (2) to copies lawfully made\noutside the United States but initially sold in the United\nStates with the copyright owner’s permission. Denbicare\n8         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Toys “R” Us, Inc., 84 F. 3d 1143, 1149–1150\n(1996).\n   Under any of these geographical interpretations,\n§109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine would not apply to the Wiley\nAsia books at issue here. And, despite an American copy­\nright owner’s permission to make copies abroad, one who\nbuys a copy of any such book or other copyrighted work—\nwhether at a retail store, over the Internet, or at a library\nsale—could not resell (or otherwise dispose of) that partic­\nular copy without further permission.\n   Kirtsaeng, however, reads the words “lawfully made\nunder this title” as imposing a non-geographical limita­\ntion. He says that they mean made “in accordance with”\nor “in compliance with” the Copyright Act. Brief for Peti­\ntioner 26. In that case, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine\nwould apply to copyrighted works as long as their manu­\nfacture met the requirements of American copyright law.\nIn particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here,\ncopies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the\ncopyright owner. See §106 (referring to the owner’s right\nto authorize).\n   In our view, §109(a)’s language, its context, and the\ncommon-law history of the “first sale” doctrine, taken\ntogether, favor a non-geographical interpretation. We also\ndoubt that Congress would have intended to create the\npractical copyright-related harms with which a geograph­\nical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,\nartistic, commercial, and consumer activities. See Part II–\nD, infra. We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng’s\nnongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.\n                            A\n  The language of §109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng’s\nnongeographical interpretation, namely, that “lawfully\nmade under this title” means made “in accordance with” or\n“in compliance with” the Copyright Act. The language of\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§109(a) says nothing about geography. The word “under”\ncan mean “[i]n accordance with.” 18 Oxford English Dic­\ntionary 950 (2d ed. 1989). See also Black’s Law Dictionary\n1525 (6th ed. 1990) (“according to”). And a nongeograph­\nical interpretation provides each word of the five-word\nphrase with a distinct purpose. The first two words of the\nphrase, “lawfully made,” suggest an effort to distinguish\nthose copies that were made lawfully from those that were\nnot, and the last three words, “under this title,” set forth\nthe standard of “lawful[ness].” Thus, the nongeograph-\nical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright\nobjective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word\nlinguistic sense.\n   The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with\nlinguistic difficulties. It gives the word “lawfully” little,\nif any, linguistic work to do. (How could a book be unlaw­\nfully “made under this title”?) It imports geography into a\nstatutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.\nAnd it is far more complex than may at first appear.\n   To read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec­\nond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first empha­\nsize the word “under.” Indeed, Wiley reads “under this\ntitle” to mean “in conformance with the Copyright Act\nwhere the Copyright Act is applicable.” Brief for Respond­\nent 15. Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that\nthe Act “is applicable” only in the United States. Ibid.\nAnd the Solicitor General must do the same. See Brief for\nUnited States 6 (“A copy is ‘lawfully made under this title’\nif Title 17 governs the copy’s creation and the copy is made\nin compliance with Title 17’s requirements”). See also\npost, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“under” describes\nsomething “governed or regulated by another”).\n    One difficulty is that neither “under” nor any other\nword in the phrase means “where.” See, e.g., 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, supra, at 947–952 (definition of “un­\nder”). It might mean “subject to,” see post, at 6, but as this\n10        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a\nuniform, consistent meaning. See Kucana v. Holder, 558\nU. S. 233, 245 (2010) (“ ‘under’ is chameleon”); Ardestani v.\nINS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (“under” has “many dic­\ntionary definitions” and “must draw its meaning from its\ncontext”).\n   A far more serious difficulty arises out of the uncer­\ntainty and complexity surrounding the second step’s effort\nto read the necessary geographical limitation into the word\n“applicable” (or the equivalent). Where, precisely, is the\nCopyright Act “applicable”? The Act does not instantly\nprotect an American copyright holder from unauthorized\npiracy taking place abroad. But that fact does not mean\nthe Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad. As a matter\nof ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing,\nsay, a tariff upon “any rhododendron grown in Nepal”\napplies to all Nepalese rhododendrons. And, similarly,\none can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable\nto all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.\nIndeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor\nGeneral’s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are “sub­\nject to” the Act. §602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer-\nring to importation of copies “the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would\nhave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title\nhad been applicable”); Brief for United States 5. See also\npost, at 6 (suggesting that “made under” may be read as\n“subject to”).\n   The appropriateness of this linguistic usage is under­\nscored by the fact that §104 of the Act itself says that\nworks “subject to protection under this title” include un­\npublished works “without regard to the nationality or\ndomicile of the author,” and works “first published” in any\none of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright\ntreaty with the United States. §§104(a), (b) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added); §101 (2006 ed., Supp. V) (defining\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“treaty party”); U. S. Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A,\nInternational Copyright Relations of the United States\n(2010). Thus, ordinary English permits us to say that the\nAct “applies” to an Irish manuscript lying in its author’s\nDublin desk drawer as well as to an original recording of\na ballet performance first made in Japan and now on\ndisplay in a Kyoto art gallery. Cf. 4 M. Nimmer & D.\nNimmer, Copyright §17.02, pp. 17–18, 17–19 (2012) (herein­\nafter Nimmer on Copyright) (noting that the principle that\n“copyright laws do not have any extraterritorial operation”\n“requires some qualification”).\n   The Ninth Circuit’s geographical interpretation pro-\nduces still greater linguistic difficulty. As we said, that Cir­\ncuit interprets the “first sale” doctrine to cover both (1)\ncopies manufactured in the United States and (2) copies\nmanufactured abroad but first sold in the United States\nwith the American copyright owner’s permission. Den­\nbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d, at 1149–1150. See also Brief\nfor Respondent 16 (suggesting that the clause at least\nexcludes “the foreign production of a copy for distribution\nexclusively abroad”); id., at 51 (the Court need “not de-\ncide whether the copyright owner would be able to restrict\nfurther distribution” in the case of “a downstream domes­\ntic purchaser of authorized imports”); Brief for Petitioner\nin Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S. A., O. T. 2010,\nNo. 08–1423, p. 12 (excepting imported copies “made by\nunrelated foreign copyright holders” (emphasis deleted)).\n   We can understand why the Ninth Circuit may have\nthought it necessary to add the second part of its defini­\ntion. As we shall later describe, see Part II–D, infra,\nwithout some such qualification a copyright holder could\nprevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving\naway copies of a video game made in Japan, a film made\nin Germany, or a dress (with a design copyright) made in\nChina, even if the copyright holder has granted permission\nfor the foreign manufacture, importation, and an initial\n12         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic sale of the copy. A publisher such as Wiley\nwould be free to print its books abroad, allow their im-\nportation and sale within the United States, but prohibit\nstudents from later selling their used texts at a campus\nbookstore. We see no way, however, to reconcile this half­\ngeographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the\nlanguage of the phrase, “lawfully made under this title.”\nAs a matter of English, it would seem that those five\nwords either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they\ndo not.\n   In sum, we believe that geographical interpretations\ncreate more linguistic problems than they resolve. And\nconsiderations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely\nlinguistic balance in Kirtsaeng’s, nongeographical, favor.\n                           B\n  Both historical and contemporary statutory context in­\ndicate that Congress, when writing the present version of\n§109(a), did not have geography in mind. In respect to\nhistory, we compare §109(a)’s present language with the\nlanguage of its immediate predecessor. That predecessor\nsaid:\n     “[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, pre­\n     vent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copy­\n     righted work the possession of which has been lawfully\n     obtained.” Copyright Act of 1909, §41, 35 Stat. 1084\n     (emphasis added).\n  See also Copyright Act of 1947, §27, 61 Stat. 660. The\npredecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does\nnot argue that it does). So we ask whether Congress, in\nchanging its language implicitly introduced a geograph-\nical limitation that previously was lacking. See also Part\nII–C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law\nprinciple).\n  A comparison of language indicates that it did not. The\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor says that the “first sale” doctrine protects “the\ntransfer of any copy the possession of which has been\nlawfully obtained.” The present version says that “the\nowner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\nunder this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of\nthe possession of that copy or phonorecord.” What does\nthis change in language accomplish?\n   The language of the former version referred to those\nwho are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who\n“lawfully obtained” a copy. The present version covers\nonly those who are owners of a “lawfully made” copy.\nWhom does the change leave out? Who might have law-\nfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned\nthat copy? One answer is owners of movie theaters, who\nduring the 1970’s (and before) often leased films from\nmovie distributors or filmmakers.         See S. Donahue,\nAmerican Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing\nproducer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements);\nNote, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribu­\ntion and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of Anti-\nBlind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L. J. 131, 135\n(1986). Because the theater owners had “lawfully ob­\ntained” their copies, the earlier version could be read as\nallowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given\nthem “first sale” protection. Because the theater owners\nwere lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in\nlanguage makes clear that they (like bailees and other\nlessees) cannot take advantage of the “first sale” doctrine.\n(Those who find legislative history useful will find confir­\nmation in, e.g., House Committee on the Judiciary, Copy­\nright Law Revision, Supplementary Report of the Register\nof Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copy­\nright Law: 1965 Revision Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt.\n6, p. 30 (Comm. Print 1965) (hereinafter Copyright Law\nRevision) (“[W]here a person has rented a print of a mo­\ntion picture from the copyright owner, he would have no\n14         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nright to lend, rent, sell, or otherwise dispose of the print\nwithout first obtaining the copyright owner’s permission”).\nSee also Platt & Munk Co. v. Republic Graphics, Inc.,\n315 F. 2d 847, 851 (CA2 1963) (Friendly, J.) (pointing out\npredecessor statute’s leasing problem)).\n    This objective perfectly well explains the new language\nof the present version, including the five words here at\nissue. Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who\nowns a copy will receive “first sale” protection, provided, of\ncourse, that the copy was “lawfully made” and not pi-\nrated. The new language also takes into account that a\ncopy may be “lawfully made under this title” when the copy,\nsay of a phonorecord, comes into its owner’s possession\nthrough use of a compulsory license, which “this title”\nprovides for elsewhere, namely, in §115. Again, for those\nwho find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative\nreport makes this clear. H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, p. 79\n(1976) (“For example, any resale of an illegally ‘pirated’\nphonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition\nof a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory li­\ncensing provisions of section 115 would not”).\n    Other provisions of the present statute also support\na nongeographical interpretation. For one thing, the stat­\nute phases out the “manufacturing clause,” a clause that\nappeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation\nof many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the\nUnited States. §601, 90 Stat. 2588 (“Prior to July 1, 1982\n. . . the importation into or public distribution in the\nUnited States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly\nof nondramatic literary material . . . is prohibited unless\nthe portions consisting of such material have been manufac-\ntured in the United States or Canada”). The phasing out\nof this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manu­\nfactured in America and copies manufactured abroad. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, at 165–166.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The “equal treatment” principle, however, is difficult\nto square with a geographical interpretation of the “first\nsale” clause that would grant the holder of an American\ncopyright (perhaps a foreign national, see supra, at 10)\npermanent control over the American distribution chain\n(sales, resales, gifts, and other distribution) in respect to\ncopies printed abroad but not in respect to copies printed\nin America. And it is particularly difficult to believe that\nCongress would have sought this unequal treatment while\nsaying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the\nmanufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of\npolicy goal. Cf. Golan v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 30) (Congress has moved from a copyright\nregime that, prior to 1891, entirely excluded foreign works\nfrom U. S. copyright protection to a regime that now “en­\nsure[s] that most works, whether foreign or domestic,\nwould be governed by the same legal regime” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Finally, we normally presume that the words “lawfully\nmade under this title” carry the same meaning when they\nappear in different but related sections. Department of\nRevenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,\n342 (1994). But doing so here produces surprising conse­\nquences. Consider:\n\n  (1) Section 109(c) says that, despite the copyright own­\n  er’s exclusive right “to display” a copyrighted work\n  (provided in §106(5)), the owner of a particular copy “law-\n  fully made under this title” may publicly display it with­\n  out further authorization. To interpret these words\n  geographically would mean that one who buys a copy­\n  righted work of art, a poster, or even a bumper sticker,\n  in Canada, in Europe, in Asia, could not display\n  it in America without the copyright owner’s further\n  authorization.\n16           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     (2) Section 109(e) specifically provides that the owner\n     of a particular copy of a copyrighted video arcade game\n     “lawfully made under this title” may “publicly perform\n     or display that game in coin-operated equipment” with­\n     out the authorization of the copyright owner. To inter­\n     pret these words geographically means that an arcade\n     owner could not (“without the authority of the copyright\n     owner”) perform or display arcade games (whether new\n     or used) originally made in Japan. Cf. Red Baron-\n     Franklin Park, Inc. v. Taito Corp., 883 F. 2d 275 (CA4\n     1989).\n\n     (3) Section 110(1) says that a teacher, without the copy­\n     right owner’s authorization, is allowed to perform or\n     display a copyrighted work (say, an audiovisual work)\n     “in the course of face-to-face teaching activities”—unless\n     the teacher knowingly used “a copy that was not law-\n     fully made under this title.” To interpret these words\n     geographically would mean that the teacher could not\n     (without further authorization) use a copy of a film dur­\n     ing class if the copy was lawfully made in Canada, Mex­\n     ico, Europe, Africa, or Asia.\n\n     (4) In its introductory sentence, §106 provides the Act’s\n     basic exclusive rights to an “owner of a copyright under\n     this title.” The last three words cannot support a geo­\n     graphic interpretation.\n\nWiley basically accepts the first three readings, but ar-\ngues that Congress intended the restrictive consequences.\nAnd it argues that context simply requires that the words\nof the fourth example receive a different interpretation.\nLeaving the fourth example to the side, we shall explain in\nPart II–D, infra, why we find it unlikely that Congress\nwould have intended these, and other related consequences.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Yousuf, 560 U. S. ___,\n___, n. 13 (2010) (slip op., at 14, n. 13).       See also\nIsbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.

In the early 17th century\nLord Coke explained the common law’s refusal to permit\nrestraints on the alienation of chattels. Referring to Lit­\ntleton, who wrote in the 15th century, Gray, Two Contri­\nbutions to Coke Studies, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1127, 1135\n(2005), Lord Coke wrote:\n    “[If] a man be possessed of . . . a horse, or of any other\n    chattell . . . and give or sell his whole interest . . .\n    therein upon condition that the Donee or Vendee shall\n    not alien[ate] the same, the [condition] is voi[d], be­\n    cause his whole interest . . . is out of him, so as he\n    hath no possibilit[y] of a Reverter, and it is against\n    Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and contracting\n    betwee[n] man and man: and it is within the reason of\n    our Author that it should ouster him of all power\n    given to him.” 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of\n    England §360, p. 223 (1628).\n  A law that permits a copyright holder to control the\nresale or other disposition of a chattel once sold is simi-\nlarly “against Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and con-\ntracting.” Ibid.\n  With these last few words, Coke emphasizes the im­\n18         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nportance of leaving buyers of goods free to compete with\neach other when reselling or otherwise disposing of those\ngoods. American law too has generally thought that com­\npetition, including freedom to resell, can work to the ad­\nvantage of the consumer. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather\nProducts, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 886 (2007)\n(restraints with “manifestly anticompetitive effects” are\nper se illegal; others are subject to the rule of reason\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); 1 P. Areeda & H.\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶100, p. 4 (3d ed. 2006)\n(“[T]he principal objective of antitrust policy is to maximize\nconsumer welfare by encouraging firms to behave\ncompetitively”).\n   The “first sale” doctrine also frees courts from the ad­\nministrative burden of trying to enforce restrictions upon\ndifficult-to-trace, readily movable goods. And it avoids the\nselective enforcement inherent in any such effort. Thus, it\nis not surprising that for at least a century the “first sale”\ndoctrine has played an important role in American copy­\nright law. See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.

That is because\nCongress elsewhere in the 1976 Act included the words\n“manufactured in the United States or Canada,” 90 Stat.\n2588, which express just about the same geographical\nthought that the dissent reads into §109(a)’s very different\nlanguage.\n                              D\n   Associations of libraries, used-book dealers, technology\ncompanies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point\nto various ways in which a geographical interpretation\nwould fail to further basic constitutional copyright objec­\ntives, in particular “promot[ing] the Progress of Science\nand useful Arts.” U.

Brief for\nAmerican Library Association 15 (many books lack indica­\ntion of place of manufacture; “no practical way to learn\nwhere [a] book was printed”). And, even where addresses\ncan be found, the costs of finding them, contacting owners,\nand negotiating may be high indeed.

The used­\nbook dealers cannot easily predict what the foreign copy­\nright holder may think about a reader’s effort to sell a\nused copy of a novel.

A geographical interpretation would prevent the\nresale of, say, a car, without the permission of the holder\nof each copyright on each piece of copyrighted automobile\nsoftware.

See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 29–30.

See\nsupra, at 10 (describing how §104 often makes such works\n“subject to” American copyright protection). A geograph­\nical interpretation, they say, would require the museums\nto obtain permission from the copyright owners before\nthey could display the work, see supra, at 15—even if the\ncopyright owner has already sold or donated the work to\na foreign museum. Brief for Association of Art Museum\nDirectors et al. as Amici Curiae 10–11.

Cf. supra, at\n17–18.\n   Neither Wiley nor any of its many amici deny that a\ngeographical interpretation could bring about these “hor­\nribles”—at least in principle.

See also post, at 30–31.\n   We are less sanguine. For one thing, the law has not\nbeen settled for long in Wiley’s favor. The Second Circuit,\nin its decision below, is the first Court of Appeals to adopt\na purely geographical interpretation. The Third Circuit\nhas favored a nongeographical interpretation. Sebastian\nInt’l, 847 F. 2d 1093.

A., 84 F. 3d 1143.\nSee supra, at 11–12. And other courts have hesitated to\nadopt, and have cast doubt upon, the validity of the geo­\ngraphical interpretation. Pearson Educ., Inc. v.

Museums, for example, are\nnot in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to\ncheck with the heirs of copyright owners before sending,\ne.g., a Picasso on tour. Brief for Association of Art Mu­\nseum Directors 11–12. That inertia means a dramatic\nchange is likely necessary before these institutions, in­\nstructed by their counsel, would begin to engage in the\ncomplex permission-verifying process that a geographical\ninterpretation would demand. And this Court’s adoption\nof the geographical interpretation could provide that\ndramatic change. These intolerable consequences (along\nwith the absurd result that the copyright owner can ex-\nercise downstream control even when it authorized the\nimport or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth\nCircuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to\n24        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to\nmitigate these harms. Brief for United States 27–28;\npost, at 24–28. But those readings are not defensible, for\nthey require too many unprecedented jumps over linguis­\ntic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.\nSee, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of\n§106(3) “significantly curtails the independent effect of\n§109(a)”).\n   Finally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far\nmay simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so\nfar to assert geographically based resale rights. They may\ndecide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.\nRegardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only\nif unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that\nwould create uncertainty, would bring about selective\nenforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disre­\nspect for copyright law itself.\n   Thus, we believe that the practical problems that peti­\ntioner and his amici have described are too serious, too\nextensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss\nthem as insignificant—particularly in light of the ever­\ngrowing importance of foreign trade to America. See\nThe World Bank, Imports of goods and services (% of\nGDP) (imports in 2011 18% of U. S. gross domestic\nproduct compared to 11% in 1980), online at http://\ndata.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS? (as visited\nMar. 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nThe upshot is that copyright-related consequences along\nwith language, context, and interpretive canons argue\nstrongly against a geographical interpretation of §109(a).\n                            III\n  Wiley and the dissent make several additional impor­\ntant arguments in favor of the geographical interpretation.\nFirst, they say that our Quality King decision strongly\nsupports its geographical interpretation. In that case\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe asked whether the Act’s “importation provision,” now\n§602(a)(1) (then §602(a)), barred importation (without\npermission) of a copyrighted item (labels affixed to hair\ncare products) where an American copyright owner au­\nthorized the first sale and export of hair care products\nwith copyrighted labels made in the United States, and\nwhere a buyer sought to import them back into the United\nStates without the copyright owner’s permission. 523\nU. S., at 138–139.\n  We held that the importation provision did not prohibit\nsending the products back into the United States (without\nthe copyright owner’s permission). That section says:\n    “Importation into the United States, without the au­\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n    acquired outside the United States is an infringement\n    of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono­\n    records under section 106.” 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1)\n    (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See also\n    §602(a) (1994 ed.).\n   We pointed out that this section makes importation an\ninfringement of the “exclusive right to distribute . . . under\n106.” We noted that §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine limits\nthe scope of the §106 exclusive distribution right. We took\nas given the fact that the products at issue had at least\nonce been sold. And we held that consequently, importa­\ntion of the copyrighted labels does not violate §602(a)(1).\n523 U. S., at 145.\n   In reaching this conclusion we endorsed Bobbs-Merrill\nand its statement that the copyright laws were not “in­\ntended to create a right which would permit the holder of\nthe copyright to fasten, by notice in a book . . . a restriction\nupon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of\ncopyright after the owner had parted with the title to one\nwho had acquired full dominion over it.” 210 U. S., at\n26        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n349–350.\n   We also explained why we rejected the claim that our\ninterpretation would make §602(a)(1) pointless. Those\nadvancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copy­\nright Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provi­\nsion, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies. Qual­\nity King, supra, at 146. Thus, they said, §602(a)(1) must\nprohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to\nallow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a\nfirst sale, as Quality King’s holding would do, would leave\n§602(a)(1) without much to prohibit. It would become\nsuperfluous, without any real work to do.\n   We do not believe that this argument is a strong one.\nUnder Quality King’s interpretation, §602(a)(1) would still\nforbid importing (without permission, and subject to the\nexceptions in §602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for\nexample, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the\nlicensee of an American publisher prints copies of a book\noverseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send\nthem to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other\nmanufacturer (if not the “owner” for purposes of §109(a),\ne.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted\ngoods to the United States; (3) “a book publisher trans­\nports copies to a wholesaler” and the wholesaler (not yet\nthe owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright\nLaw Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4)\na foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri-\nbution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to\nsend them to the United States. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on\nCopyright §8.12[B][1][a], at 8–159 (“Section 109(a) pro­\nvides that the distribution right may be exercised solely\nwith respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,\nnot to prevent or restrict the resale or other further trans­\nfer of possession of such copies”). These examples show\nthat §602(a)(1) retains significance. We concede it has less\nsignificance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent also adopts a construction of §106(3) that “signifi­\ncantly curtails” §109(a)’s effect, post, at 26, and so limits\nthe scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater,\ndegree.\n   In Quality King we rejected the “superfluous” argument\nfor similar reasons. But, when rejecting it, we said that,\nwhere an author gives exclusive American distribution\nrights to an American publisher and exclusive British\ndistribution rights to a British publisher, “presumably\nonly those [copies] made by the publisher of the United\nStates edition would be ‘lawfully made under this title’\nwithin the meaning of §109(a).” 523 U. S., at 148 (empha­\nsis added). Wiley now argues that this phrase in the\nQuality King opinion means that books published abroad\n(under license) must fall outside the words “lawfully made\nunder this title” and that we have consequently already\ngiven those words the geographical interpretation that it\nfavors.\n   We cannot, however, give the Quality King statement\nthe legal weight for which Wiley argues. The language\n“lawfully made under this title” was not at issue in Qual­\nity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued;\nwe did not canvas the considerations we have here set\nforth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example\nassumes a “first sale”; and we there hedged our state-\nment with the word “presumably.” Most importantly, the\nstatement is pure dictum. It is dictum contained in a\nrebuttal to a counterargument. And it is unnecessary\ndictum even in that respect. Is the Court having once\nwritten dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny\nthat it is a fruit forever after?\n   To the contrary, we have written that we are not neces­\nsarily bound by dicta should more complete argument\ndemonstrate that the dicta is not correct. Central Va.\nCommunity College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006)\n(“[W]e are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in\n28        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the point now at issue was not fully debated”);\nHumphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602,\n627–628 (1935) (rejecting, under stare decisis, dicta, “which\nmay be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are\nnot controlling”). And, given the bit part that our Quality\nKing statement played in our Quality King decision, we\nbelieve the view of stare decisis set forth in these opinions\napplies to the matter now before us.\n   Second, Wiley and the dissent argue (to those who con­\nsider legislative history) that the Act’s legislative history\nsupports their interpretation. But the historical events to\nwhich it points took place more than a decade before the\nenactment of the Act and, at best, are inconclusive.\n   During the 1960’s, representatives of book, record, and\nfilm industries, meeting with the Register of Copyrights to\ndiscuss copyright revision, complained about the difficulty\nof dividing international markets. Copyright Law Revi­\nsion Discussion and Comments on Report of the Register\nof Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copy­\nright Law, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, p. 212 (Comm.\nPrint 1963) (English editions of “particular” books “fin[d]”\ntheir “way into this country”); id., at 213 (works “pub­\nli[shed] in a country where there is no copyright protection\nof any sort” are put into “the free stream of commerce” and\n“shipped to the United States”); ibid. (similar concern in\nrespect to films).\n   The then-Register of Copyrights, Abraham Kaminstein,\nfound these examples “very troubl[ing].” Ibid. And the\nCopyright Office released a draft provision that it said\n“deals with the matter of the importation for distribution\nin the United States of foreign copies that were made\nunder proper authority but that, if sold in the United\nStates, would be sold in contravention of the rights of the\ncopyright owner who holds the exclusive right to sell\ncopies in the United States.” Id., pt. 4, at 203. That draft\nversion, without reference to §106, simply forbids unau­\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           29\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthorized imports. It said:\n    “Importation into the United States of copies or rec­\n    ords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the\n    public shall, if such articles are imported without the\n    authority of the owner of the exclusive right to distrib-\n    ute copies or records under this title, constitute an\n    infringement of copyright actionable under section 35\n    [17 U. S. C. §501].” Id., Preliminary Draft for Revised\n    U. S. Copyright Law and Discussions and Comments,\n    88th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, pp. 32–33 (Comm. Print\n    1964).\n  In discussing the draft, some of those present expressed\nconcern about its effect on the “first sale” doctrine. For\nexample, Irwin Karp, representing the Authors League\nof America asked, “If a German jobber lawfully buys cop-\nies from a German publisher, are we not running into the\nproblem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained\ncopies?” Id., pt. 4, at 211. The Copyright Office repre­\nsentative replied, “This could vary from one situation to\nanother, I guess. I should guess, for example, that if\na book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a\nwholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of\ntransaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.”\nIbid. (emphasis added).\n  The Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a\ndraft, which, by explicitly referring to §106, was similar to\nthe provision that became law, now §602(a)(1). The Office\nnoted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of\na copy (without permission) “would violate the exclusive\nrights of the U. S. copyright owner . . . where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign\ncountry for distribution only in that country.” Id., pt. 6, at\n150.\n  Still, that part of the report says nothing about the “first\nsale” doctrine, about §109(a), or about the five words,\n30         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n“lawfully made under this title.” And neither the report\nnor its accompanying 1960’s draft answers the question\nbefore us here. Cf. Quality King, 523 U. S., at 145 (with­\nout those five words, the import clause, via its reference to\n§106, imports the “first sale” doctrine).\n   But to ascertain the best reading of §109(a), rather\nthan dissecting the remarks of industry representatives\nconcerning §602 at congressional meetings held 10 years\nbefore the statute was enacted, see post, at 13–16, we\nwould give greater weight to the congressional report\naccompanying §109(a), written a decade later when Con­\ngress passed the new law. That report says:\n       “Section 109(a) restates and confirms the principle\n     that, where the copyright owner has transferred own­\n     ership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work,\n     the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is trans­\n     ferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any\n     other means. Under this principle, which has been\n     established by the court decisions and . . . the present\n     law, the copyright owner’s exclusive right of public\n     distribution would have no effect upon anyone who\n     owns ‘a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\n     under this title’ and who wishes to transfer it to\n     someone else or to destroy it.\n      .             .               .          .             .\n        “To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy\n     or phonorecord must have been ‘lawfully made under\n     this title,’ though not necessarily with the copyright\n     owner’s authorization. For example, any resale of an\n     illegally ‘pirated’ phonorecord would be an infringe­\n     ment but the disposition of a phonorecord legally\n     made under the compulsory licensing provisions of\n     section 115 would not.” H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, at 79\n     (emphasis added).\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             31\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nAccord, S. Rep. No. 94–473, pp. 71–72 (1975).\n   This history reiterates the importance of the “first sale”\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Copyright Law Revision, 1964 Revision\nBill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess., pt. 5, p. 66 (Comm. Print 1965) (“[F]ull ownership of\na lawfully-made copy authorizes its owner to dispose of\nit freely”). It explains, as we have explained, the nongeo­\ngraphical purposes of the words “lawfully made under this\ntitle.” Part II–B, supra. And it says nothing about geog­\nraphy. Nor, importantly, did §109(a)’s predecessor provi­\nsion. See supra, at 12. This means that, contrary to the\ndissent’s suggestion, any lack of legislative history per­\ntaining to the “first sale” doctrine only tends to bolster\nour position that Congress’ 1976 revision did not intend to\ncreate a drastic geographical change in its revision to that\nprovision. See post, at 18, n. 13. We consequently believe\nthat the legislative history, on balance, supports the non-\ngeographical interpretation.\n   Third, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeograph­\nical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impos­\nsible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide\nforeign and domestic markets. We concede that is so. A\npublisher may find it more difficult to charge different\nprices for the same book in different geographic markets.\nBut we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can\nfind no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that\npublishers are especially entitled to such rights.\n   The Constitution describes the nature of American\ncopyright law by providing Congress with the power to\n“secur[e]” to “[a]uthors” “for limited [t]imes” the “exclusive\n[r]ight to their . . . [w]ritings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. The Found­\ners, too, discussed the need to grant an author a limited\nright to exclude competition. Compare Letter from Thomas\nJefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 442–443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956)\n(arguing against any monopoly) with Letter from James\n32        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at\n16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) (arguing for a limited monopoly\nto secure production). But the Constitution’s language\nnowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should\ninclude a right to divide markets or a concomitant right\nto charge different purchasers different prices for the same\nbook, say to increase or to maximize gain. Neither, to our\nknowledge, did any Founder make any such suggestion.\nWe have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference\nfor interpretations of copyright statutes that would pro­\nvide for market divisions. Cf. Copyright Law Revision, pt.\n2, at 194 (statement of Barbara Ringer, Copyright Office)\n(division of territorial markets was “primarily a matter of\nprivate contract”).\n   To the contrary, Congress enacted a copyright law that\n(through the “first sale” doctrine) limits copyright holders’\nability to divide domestic markets. And that limitation is\nconsistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid mar­\nket divisions. Cf. Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U.

Neither the text\nnor the history of 17 U. S. C. §109(a) supports removing\nfirst-sale protection from every copy of a protected work\nmanufactured abroad. See ante, at 8–16, 28–31. I recog-\nnize, however, that the combination of today’s decision\nand Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research\nInt’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135 (1998), constricts the scope of\n§602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation. I write to\nsuggest that any problems associated with that limitation\ncome not from our reading of §109(a) here, but from Qual-\nity King’s holding that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1).\n   As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played\nan integral part in American copyright law for over a\ncentury. See ante, at 17–19; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,\n210 U. S. 339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior\nto 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies\nmade in the United States. See ante, at 12. And nothing\nin the text or history of §109(a)—the Copyright Act of\n1976’s first-sale provision—suggests that Congress meant\nto enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley\nproposes, which at once would deprive American consum-\ners of important rights and encourage copyright holders to\nmanufacture abroad. See ante, at 8–16, 28–31.\n2           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n   That said, John Wiley is right that the Court’s decision,\nwhen combined with Quality King, substantially narrows\n§602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation. Quality\nKing held that the importation ban does not reach any\ncopies receiving first-sale protection under §109(a). See\n523 U. S., at 151–152. So notwithstanding §602(a)(1), an\n“owner of a particular copy . . . lawfully made under this\ntitle” can import that copy without the copyright owner’s\npermission. §109(a). In now holding that copies “lawfully\nmade under this title” include copies manufactured\nabroad, we unavoidably diminish §602(a)(1)’s scope—\nindeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See\nante, at 26–27.\n   But if Congress views the shrinking of §602(a)(1) as a\nproblem, it should recognize Quality King—not our deci-\nsion today—as the culprit. Here, after all, we merely\nconstrue §109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that\n§109(a) limits §602(a)(1). Had we come out the opposite\nway in that case, §602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner\nto restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the\nfirst-sale doctrine.1 That result would enable the copy-\nright owner to divide international markets in the way\nJohn Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting\n§602(a)(1). But it would do so without imposing down-\n——————\n  1 Although Quality King concluded that the statute’s text foreclosed\n\nthat outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151–152, the Solicitor General offered a\ncogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that §109(a) does not\nlimit §602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to “sell” or\n“dispose” of copies—not to import them: The Act’s first-sale provision\nand its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping\nspheres of conduct. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96–1470, pp. 5, 8–10. That reading\nremains the Government’s preferred way of construing the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 44 (“[W]e think that we still would adhere to our view\nthat section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section\n602(a)(1)”); see also ante, at 32–33; post, at 21, n. 15 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

In other words, that outcome would tar-\nget unauthorized importers alone, and not the “libraries,\nused-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods\nretailers, and museums” with whom the Court today is\nrightly concerned. Ante, at 19. Assuming Congress\nadopted §602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I sus-\npect that is how Congress thought the provision would\nwork—not by removing first-sale protection from every copy\nmanufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here),\nbut by enabling the copyright holder to control imports\neven when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King\nnow prevents).2\n  At bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks\nus to misconstrue §109(a) in order to restore §602(a)(1)\nto its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright\nholders to segment international markets. I think John\nWiley may have a point about what §602(a)(1) was de-\nsigned to do; that gives me pause about Quality King’s\nholding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation\nban’s scope. But the Court today correctly declines the\n——————\n  2 Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective\n\nof the first-sale doctrine—i.e., reversing Quality King—would yield a\nfar more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting\nJohn Wiley’s argument here. That is because only the former approach\nturns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their\nplace of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley\nprints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain\nversions only in Thailand. Without Quality King, John Wiley could do\nso—i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and pre-\nvent anyone from importing them back into the United States. But\nwith Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its\nreading of §109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-\nimporting the books—and so to segment the Thai market—John Wiley\nwould have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no reason\nwhy Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner’s power to\ndivide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.\n4         KIRTSAENG v.

That would swap\none (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make\nour reading of the statute only less reflective of Congres-\nsional intent. If Congress thinks copyright owners need\ngreater power to restrict importation and thus divide\nmarkets, a ready solution is at hand—not the one John\nWiley offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in\nQuality King.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The Court’s bold\ndeparture from Congress’ design is all the more stunning,\nfor it places the United States at the vanguard of the\nmovement for “international exhaustion” of copyrights—a\nmovement the United States has steadfastly resisted on\nthe world stage.\n  To justify a holding that shrinks to insignificance copy­\nright protection against the unauthorized importation of\nforeign-made copies, the Court identifies several “practical\nproblems.” Ante, at 24. The Court’s parade of horribles,\nhowever, is largely imaginary. Congress’ objective in\nenacting 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1)’s importation prohibition\ncan be honored without generating the absurd conse­\nquences hypothesized in the Court’s opinion. I dissent\n2         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the Court’s embrace of “international exhaustion,”\nand would affirm the sound judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n   Because economic conditions and demand for particular\ngoods vary across the globe, copyright owners have a\nfinancial incentive to charge different prices for copies of\ntheir works in different geographic regions. Their ability\nto engage in such price discrimination, however, is under-\nmined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies\nfrom low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.\nThe question in this case is whether the unauthorized\nimportation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright\ninfringement under U. S. law.\n   To answer this question, one must examine three provi­\nsions of Title 17 of the U. S. Code: §§106(3), 109(a), and\n602(a)(1). Section 106 sets forth the “exclusive rights” of a\ncopyright owner, including the right “to distribute copies\nor phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by\nsale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or\nlending.” §106(3). This distribution right is limited by\n§109(a), which provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions\nof section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phono-\nrecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,\nwithout the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or\notherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or\nphonorecord.” Section 109(a) codifies the “first sale doc­\ntrine,” a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.\nStraus, 210 U. S. 339, 349–351 (1908), which held that a\ncopyright owner could not control the price at which re­\ntailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work. The\nfirst sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner\nshould not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over\nthe distribution of copies of a copyrighted work. At some\npoint—ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale—\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe copyright owner’s exclusive right under §106(3) to\ncontrol the distribution of a particular copy is exhausted,\nand from that point forward, the copy can be resold or\notherwise redistributed without the copyright owner’s\nauthorization.\n  Section 602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V)1—last, but most\ncritical, of the three copyright provisions bearing on this\ncase—is an importation ban. It reads:\n        “Importation into the United States, without the\n     authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n     acquired outside the United States is an infringe-\n     ment of the exclusive right to distribute copies or\n     phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sec­\n     tion 501.”\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research\nInt’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 143–154 (1998), the Court held\nthat a copyright owner’s right to control importation under\n§602(a)(1) is a component of the distribution right set forth\nin §106(3) and is therefore subject to §109(a)’s codification\nof the first sale doctrine. Quality King thus held that\nthe importation of copies made in the United States but\nsold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement\nunder §602(a)(1). Id., at 143–154. See also id., at 154\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (Quality King “involve[d] a\n‘round trip’ journey, travel of the copies in question from\nthe United States to places abroad, then back again”).2\n——————\n  1 In 2008, Congress renumbered what was previously §602(a) as\n\n§602(a)(1). See Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual\nProperty Act of 2008 (PROIPA), §105(b)(2), 122 Stat. 4259. Like the\nCourt, I refer to the provision by its current numbering.\n  2 Although JUSTICE KAGAN’s concurrence suggests that Quality King\n\nerred in “holding that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1),” ante, at 2, that recent,\nunanimous holding must be taken as a given.

Section 602(a)(1), the Court noted,\nwould apply to “copies that were ‘lawfully made’ not under\nthe United States Copyright Act, but instead, under the\nlaw of some other country.” Id., at 147. Drawing on an\nexample discussed during a 1964 public meeting on pro­\nposed revisions to the U. S. copyright laws,3 the Court\nstated:\n     “If the author of [a] work gave the exclusive United\n     States distribution rights—enforceable under the\n     Act—to the publisher of the United States edition and\n     the exclusive British distribution rights to the pub­\n     lisher of the British edition, . . . presumably only those\n     [copies] made by the publisher of the United States\n     edition would be ‘lawfully made under this title’\n     within the meaning of §109(a).

The Court’s\nobjective in this case should be to avoid unduly “constrict[ing] the scope\nof §602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation,” ante, at 1 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), while at the same time remaining faithful to Quality King’s\nholding and to the text and history of other Copyright Act provisions.\nThis aim is not difficult to achieve. See Parts II–V, infra. JUSTICE\nKAGAN and I appear to agree to this extent: Congress meant the ban on\nunauthorized importation to have real force.

(Wiley). App. 29–\n34. See also ante, at 3–5 (opinion of the Court). In the\nwords the Court used in Quality King, these copies “were\n‘lawfully made’ not under the United States Copyright\nAct, but instead, under the law of some other country.”\n523 U. S., at 147. Section 109(a) therefore does not ap-\nply, and Kirtsaeng’s unauthorized importation constitutes\ncopyright infringement under §602(a)(1).\n   The Court does not deny that under the language I have\nquoted from Quality King, Wiley would prevail. Ante, at\n27. Nevertheless, the Court dismisses this language, to\nwhich all Members of the Quality King Court subscribed,\nas ill-considered dictum. Ante, at 27–28. I agree that the\ndiscussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essen­\ntial to the Court’s judgment. See Quality King, 523 U. S.,\nat 154 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (“[W]e do not today\nresolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports\nwere manufactured abroad.”). But I disagree with the\nCourt’s conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.\nInstead, for the reasons explained below, I would hold,\nconsistently with Quality King’s dictum, that §602(a)(1)\nauthorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a\ncopy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.\n                            II\n  The text of the Copyright Act demonstrates that Con­\ngress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent\n6         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nremedy against the importation of foreign-made copies of\ntheir copyrighted works. As the Court recognizes, ante, at\n3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase “lawfully\nmade under this title” in §109(a). In my view, that phrase\nis most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a\ncopy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compli­\nance with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. This reading is\nconsistent with the Court’s interpretation of similar lan­\nguage in other statutes. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v.\nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 52–53 (2008)\n(“under” in 11 U. S. C. §1146(a), a Bankruptcy Code provi­\nsion exempting certain asset transfers from stamp taxes,\nmeans “pursuant to”); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135\n(1991) (the phrase “under section 554” in the Equal Access\nto Justice Act means “subject to” or “governed by” 5\nU. S. C. §554 (internal quotation marks omitted)). It also\naccords with dictionary definitions of the word “under.”\nSee, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 1887 (5th ed.\n2011) (“under” means, among other things, “[s]ubject to\nthe authority, rule, or control of ”).\n   Section 109(a), properly read, affords Kirtsaeng no\ndefense against Wiley’s claim of copyright infringement.\nThe Copyright Act, it has been observed time and again,\ndoes not apply extraterritorially.

Patry, Copyright §13:22, p. 13–66\n(2012) (hereinafter Patry) (“Copyright laws are rigor-\nously territorial.”).    The printing of Wiley’s foreign­\nmanufactured textbooks therefore was not governed by\nTitle 17. The textbooks thus were not “lawfully made\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

And if §109(a) does not apply, there is no dis­\npute that Kirtsaeng’s conduct constituted copyright in­\nfringement under §602(a)(1).\n   The Court’s point of departure is similar to mine. Ac­\ncording to the Court, the phrase “ ‘lawfully made under\nthis title’ means made ‘in accordance with’ or ‘in compli­\nance with’ the Copyright Act.” Ante, at 8. But the Court\noverlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites,\nante, at 9, the word “under” commonly signals a relation­\nship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regu-\nlated by another. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed.\n1990) (“under” “frequently” means “inferior” or “subordi­\nnate” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (“under” means,\namong other things, “[i]n accordance with (some regulative\npower or principle)” (emphasis added)). See also Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (“under”\nmeans, among other things, “in . . . a condition of sub-\njection, regulation, or subordination” and “suffering re­\nstriction, restraint, or control by”). Only by disregarding\nthis established meaning of “under” can the Court arrive\nat the conclusion that Wiley’s foreign-manufactured text­\nbooks were “lawfully made under” U. S. copyright law,\neven though that law did not govern their creation. It is\nanomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as\n“lawful” under an inapplicable law. For example, one\nmight say that driving on the right side of the road in\nEngland is “lawful” under U. S. law, but that would be so\nonly because U. S. law has nothing to say about the sub­\nject. The governing law is English law, and English law\ndemands that driving be done on the left side of the road.4\n——————\n  4 The Court asserts that my position gives the word “lawfully” in\n\n§109(a) “little, if any, linguistic work to do.” Ante, at 9.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The logical implication of the Court’s definition of the\nword “under” is that any copy manufactured abroad—even\na piratical one made without the copyright owner’s author­\nization and in violation of the law of the country where it\nwas created—would fall within the scope of §109(a). Any\nsuch copy would have been made “in accordance with” or\n“in compliance with” the U. S. Copyright Act, in the sense\nthat manufacturing the copy did not violate the Act (be­\ncause the Act does not apply extraterritorially).\n  The Court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd\nconclusion. Instead, it interprets §109(a) as applying only\nto copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or\nwould have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been ap­\nplicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United\nStates). See ante, at 8 (“§109(a)’s ‘first sale’ doctrine would\napply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture\nmet the requirements of American copyright law.”). Con­\ngress, however, used express language when it called for\nsuch a counterfactual inquiry in 17 U. S. C. §§602(a)(2)\nand (b). See §602(a)(2) (“Importation into the United\nStates or exportation from the United States, without the\nauthority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\ncopies or phonorecords, the making of which either consti­\ntuted an infringement of copyright, or which would have\nconstituted an infringement of copyright if this title had\nbeen applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right\nto distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106.”\n(emphasis added)); §602(b) (“In a case where the making\n——————\nunder this title.” The word “made” signifies that the conduct at issue is\nthe creation or manufacture of a copy. See Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1356 (1961) (defining “made” as “artificially\nproduced by a manufacturing process”). The word “lawfully” indicates\nthat for §109(a) to apply, the copy’s creation must have complied with\nsome body of law. Finally, the prepositional phrase “under this title”\nclarifies what that body of law is—namely, the copyright prescriptions\ncontained in Title 17 of the U. S. Code.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Had\nCongress intended courts to engage in a similarly hypo­\nthetical inquiry under §109(a), Congress would pre-\nsumably have included similar language in that section.\nSee Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(“ ‘[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.’ ” (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,\n472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam); brackets in\noriginal)).5\n——————\n  5 Attempting  to show that my reading of §109(a) is susceptible to the\nsame criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed “manufacturing\nclause,” which required “copies of a work consisting preponderantly of\nnondramatic literary material . . . in the English language” to be\n“manufactured in the United States or Canada.” Copyright Act of 1976,\n§601(a), 90 Stat. 2588. Because Congress expressly referred to manu­\nfacturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase “lawfully\nmade under this title” in §109(a) cannot mean “manufactured in the\nUnited States.” Ante, at 19. This argument is a non sequitur. I do not\ncontend that the phrases “lawfully made under this title” and “manu­\nfactured in the United States” are interchangeable. To repeat, I read\nthe phrase “lawfully made under this title” as referring to instances in\nwhich a copy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance\nwith, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. See supra, at 6. Not all copies “manu­\nfactured in the United States” will satisfy this standard. For example,\npiratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copy­\nright owner’s authorization are not “lawfully made under [Title 17].”\nNor would the phrase “lawfully manufactured in the United States” be\nan exact substitute for “lawfully made under this title.” The making of\na copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provi­\nsion of law. Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright\nowner’s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum\nwage. The copy would be “lawfully made under [Title 17]” in the sense\nthat its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the\ncopy’s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the viola­\n10           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Not only does the Court adopt an unnatural construc­\ntion of the §109(a) phrase “lawfully made under this title.”\nConcomitantly, the Court reduces §602(a)(1) to insignifi­\ncance. As the Court appears to acknowledge, see ante, at\n26, the only independent effect §602(a)(1) has under to­\nday’s decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations\ncarried out by persons who merely have possession of, but\ndo not own, the imported copies. See 17 U. S. C. §109(a)\n(§109(a) applies to any “owner of a particular copy or\nphonorecord lawfully made under this title” (emphasis\nadded)).6 If this is enough to avoid rendering §602(a)(1)\nentirely “superfluous,” ante, at 26, it hardly suffices to give\nthe owner’s importation right the scope Congress intended\nit to have. Congress used broad language in §602(a)(1); it\ndid so to achieve a broad objective. Had Congress intended\nsimply to provide a copyright remedy against larcenous\nlessees, licensees, consignees, and bailees of films and\nother copyright-protected goods, see ante, at 13–14, 26, it\nlikely would have used language tailored to that narrow\npurpose. See 2 Nimmer §8.12[B][6][c], at 8–184.31, n. 432\n(“It may be wondered whether . . . potential causes of\naction [against licensees and the like] are more than theo­\nretical.”). See also ante, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concurring) (the\nCourt’s decision limits §602(a)(1) “to a fairly esoteric set of\n——————\ntion of the minimum-wage laws.\n   6 When §602(a)(1) was originally enacted in 1976, it played an addi­\n\ntional role—providing a private cause of action against importers of\npiratical goods. See Quality King, 523 U. S., at 146. In 2008, however,\nCongress amended §602 to provide for such a cause of action in\n§602(a)(2), which prohibits the unauthorized “[i]mportation into the\nUnited States . . . of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have consti­\ntuted an infringement of copyright if [Title 17] had been applicable.”\nSee PROIPA, §105(b)(3), 122 Stat. 4259–4260. Thus, under the Court’s\ninterpretation, the only conduct reached by §602(a)(1) but not\n§602(a)(2) is a nonowner’s unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical\ncopy.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

C.\n§602(a)(3)’s exceptions to §602(a)(1)’s importation prohibi­\ntion. 2 P. Goldstein, Copyright §7.6.1.2(a), p. 7:141 (3d ed.\n2012) (hereinafter Goldstein).8 Those exceptions permit\nthe importation of copies without the copyright owner’s\nauthorization for certain governmental, personal, schol-\narly, educational, and religious purposes. 17 U. S. C.\n§602(a)(3). Copies imported under these exceptions “will\noften be lawfully made gray market goods purchased\nthrough normal market channels abroad.” 2 Goldstein\n——————\n   7 Notably, the Court ignores the history of §602(a)(1), which reveals\n\nthat the primary purpose of the prescription was not to provide a\nremedy against rogue licensees, consignees, and bailees, against whom\ncopyright owners could frequently assert breach-of-contract claims even\nin the absence of §602(a)(1). Instead, the primary purpose of §602(a)(1)\nwas to reach third-party importers, enterprising actors like Kirtsaeng,\nagainst whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to\nlack of privity. See Part III, infra.\n   8 Section 602(a)(3) provides:\n\n“This subsection [i.e., §602(a)] does not apply to—\n   “(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the\nauthority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of\nany State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or\nphonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work\nimported for purposes other than archival use;\n   “(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or\nexporter and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more\nthan one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by\nany person arriving from outside the United States or departing from\nthe United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part\nof such person’s personal baggage; or\n   “(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly,\neducational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect\nto no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival\npurposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other\nwork for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation\nof such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of sys­\ntematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization\nin violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2).”\n12           KIRTSAENG v.

For example,\nhad Congress conceived of §109(a)’s sweep as the Court\ndoes, what earthly reason would there be to provide, as\nCongress did in §602(a)(3)(C), that a library may import\n“no more than five copies” of a non-audiovisual work for its\n“lending or archival purposes”?\n   The far more plausible reading of §§109(a) and 602(a),\nthen, is that Congress intended §109(a) to apply to copies\nmade in the United States, not to copies manufactured\nand sold abroad. That reading of the first sale and impor­\ntation provisions leaves §602(a)(3)’s exceptions with real,\nmeaningful work to do. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (“It is a cardinal principle of statutory\nconstruction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sen­\ntence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the range of circum-\nstances covered by the exceptions, §602(a)(3) frees indi­\nviduals and entities who purchase foreign-made copies\nabroad from the requirement they would otherwise face\nunder §602(a)(1) of obtaining the copyright owner’s per­\nmission to import the copies into the United States.10\n——————\n  9 The term “gray market good” refers to a good that is “imported out­\n\nside the distribution channels that have been contractually negotiated\nby the intellectual property owner.” Forsyth & Rothnie, Parallel\nImports, in The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and\nCompetition Policy 429 (S. Anderman ed. 2007). Such goods are also\ncommonly called “parallel imports.” Ibid.\n  10 The Court asserts that its reading of §109(a) is bolstered by §104,\n\nwhich extends the copyright “protection[s]” of Title 17 to a wide variety\nof foreign works. See ante, at 10–11. The “protection under this title”\nafforded by §104, however, is merely protection against infringing\nconduct within the United States, the only place where Title 17 applies.\nSee 4 W. Patry, Copyright §13:44.10, pp. 13–128 to 13–129 (2012)\n(hereinafter Patry). Thus, my reading of the phrase “under this title” in\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Section\n602(a)(1) was enacted as part of the Copyright Act of 1976,\n90 Stat. 2589–2590. That Act was the product of a lengthy\nrevision effort overseen by the U. S. Copyright Office. See\nMills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U. S. 153, 159–160 (1985).\nIn its initial 1961 report on recommended revisions, the\nCopyright Office noted that publishers had “suggested\nthat the [then-existing] import ban on piratical copies\nshould be extended to bar the importation of . . . foreign\nedition[s]” in violation of “agreements to divide interna­\ntional markets for copyrighted works.” Copyright Law\nRevision: Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U.

See Copyright Act of 1947,\n§106, 61 Stat. 663 (“The importation into the United\nStates . . . of any piratical copies of any work copyrighted\n——————\n§109(a) is consistent with Congress’ use of that phrase in §104. Fur­\nthermore, §104 describes which works are entitled to copyright protec­\ntion under U. S. law. But no one disputes that Wiley’s copyrights in the\nworks at issue in this case are valid. The only question is whether\nKirtsaeng’s importation of copies of those works infringed Wiley’s\ncopyrights. It is basic to copyright law that “[o]wnership of a copyright\n. . . is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work\nis embodied.” 17 U. S. C. §202. See also §101 (“ ‘Copies’ are material\nobjects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any\nmethod now known or later developed, and from which the work can be\nperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or\nwith the aid of a machine or device.”). Given the distinction copyright\nlaw draws between works and copies, §104 is inapposite to the question\nhere presented. 4 Patry §13:44.10, at 13–129 (“There is no connection,\nlinguistically or substantively, between Section[s] 104 and 109: Section\n104 deals with national eligibility for the intangible work of authorship;\nSection 109(a) deals with the tangible, physical embodiment of the\nwork, the ‘copy.’ ”).\n14         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nin the United States . . . is prohibited.”). The Copyright\nOffice originally recommended against such an extension\nof the importation ban, reasoning that enforcement of\nterritorial restrictions was best left to contract law. Copy­\nright Law Revision 126.\n   Publishing-industry representatives argued strenuously\nagainst the position initially taken by the Copyright Of­\nfice. At a 1962 panel discussion on the Copyright Office’s\nreport, for example, Horace Manges of the American Book\nPublishers Council stated:\n     “When a U. S. book publisher enters into a contract\n     with a British publisher to acquire exclusive U. S.\n     rights for a particular book, he often finds that the\n     English edition . . . of that particular book finds its\n     way into this country. Now it’s all right to say, ‘Com­\n     mence a lawsuit for breach of contract.’ But this is\n     expensive, burdensome, and, for the most part, inef­\n     fective.” Copyright Law Revision Part 2: Discussion\n     and Comments on Report of the Register of Copy­\n     rights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copyright\n     Law, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 212 (H. R. Judiciary\n     Comm. Print 1963).\n   Sidney Diamond, representing London Records, elabo­\nrated on Manges’ statement. “There are many situations,”\nhe explained, “in which it is not necessarily a question of\nthe inadequacy of a contract remedy—in the sense that it\nmay be difficult or not quick enough to solve the particular\nproblem.” Id., at 213. “Very frequently,” Diamond stated,\npublishers “run into a situation where . . . copies of [a]\nwork . . . produced in a foreign country . . . may be shipped\n[to the United States] without violating any contract of the\nU. S. copyright proprietor.” Ibid. To illustrate, Diamond\nnoted, if a “British publisher [sells a copy] to an individual\nwho in turn ship[s] it over” to the United States, the indi­\nvidual’s conduct would not “violate [any] contract between\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe British and the American publisher.” Ibid. In such a\ncase, “no possibility of any contract remedy” would exist.\nIbid. The facts of Kirtsaeng’s case fit Diamond’s example,\nsave that the copies at issue here were printed and ini-\ntially sold in Asia rather than Great Britain.\n   After considering comments on its 1961 report, the\nCopyright Office “prepared a preliminary draft of provi­\nsions for a new copyright statute.” Copyright Law Revi­\nsion Part 3: Preliminary Draft for Revised U. S. Copyright\nLaw and Discussions and Comments on the Draft, 88th\nCong., 2d Sess., V (H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1964).\nSection 44 of the draft statute addressed the concerns\nraised by publishing-industry representatives. In particu­\nlar, §44(a) provided:\n    “Importation into the United States of copies or rec­\n    ords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the\n    public shall, if such articles are imported without the\n    authority of the owner of the exclusive right to dis­\n    tribute copies or records under this title, constitute an\n    infringement of copyright actionable under section 35\n    [i.e., the section providing for a private cause of action\n    for copyright infringement].” Id., at 32–33.\n   In a 1964 panel discussion regarding the draft statute,\nAbe Goldman, the Copyright Office’s General Counsel, left\nno doubt about the meaning of §44(a). It represented, he\nexplained, a “shif[t]” from the Copyright Office’s 1961\nreport, which had recommended against using copyright\nlaw to facilitate publishers’ efforts to segment interna­\ntional markets. Copyright Law Revision Part 4: Further\nDiscussions and Comments on Preliminary Draft for\nRevised U. S. Copyright Law, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 203\n(H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1964). Section 44(a), Gold­\nman stated, would allow copyright owners to bring in­\nfringement actions against importers of “foreign copies\nthat were made under proper authority.” Ibid. See also\n16           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nid., at 205–206 (Goldman agreed with a speaker’s com­\nment that §44(a) “enlarge[d]” U. S. copyright law by ex­\ntending import prohibitions “to works legally produced in\nEurope” and other foreign countries).11\n  The next step in the copyright revision process was the\nintroduction in Congress of a draft bill on July 20, 1964.\nSee Copyright Law Revision Part 5: 1964 Revision Bill\nwith Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., III\n(H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1965). After another round\nof public comments, a revised bill was introduced on Feb­\nruary 4, 1965. See Copyright Law Revision Part 6: Sup­\nplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law: 1965 Revi­\nsion Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., V (H. R. Judiciary Comm.\nPrint 1965) (hereinafter Copyright Law Revision Part 6).\nIn language closely resembling the statutory text later\nenacted by Congress, §602(a) of the 1965 bill provided:\n     “Importation into the United States, without the au­\n     thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work for the purpose of\n     distribution to the public is an infringement of the ex­\n     clusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords un­\n     der section 106, actionable under section 501.” Id., at\n     292.12\n\n——————\n  11 As the Court observes, ante, at 29, Irwin Karp of the Authors\n\nLeague of America stated at the 1964 panel discussion that §44(a) ran\ncounter to “the very basic concept of copyright law that, once you’ve sold\na copy legally, you can’t restrict its resale.” Copyright Law Revision\nPart 4, at 212. When asked if he was “presenting . . . an argument\nagainst” §44(a), however, Karp responded that he was “neutral on th[e]\nprovision.” Id., at 211. There is thus little reason to believe that any\nchanges to the wording of §44(a) before its codification in §602(a) were\nmade in response to Karp’s discussion of “the problem of restricting\n[the] transfer of . . . lawfully obtained [foreign] copies.” Ibid.\n  12 There is but one difference between this language from the 1965\n\nbill and the corresponding language in the current version of §602(a)(1):\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 29. The\nCopyright Office, however, did not see it that way. In its\nsummary of the 1965 bill’s provisions, the Copyright Office\nobserved that §602(a) of the 1965 bill, like §44(a) of the\nCopyright Office’s prior draft, see supra, at 15–16, permit­\nted copyright owners to bring infringement actions against\nunauthorized importers in cases “where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of [the imported] copies\nin a foreign country for distribution only in that country.”\nCopyright Law Revision Part 6, at 149–150. See also id.,\nat XXVI (Under §602(a) of the 1965 bill, “[a]n unauthorized\nimporter could be enjoined and sued for damages both\nwhere the copies or phonorecords he was importing\nwere ‘piratical’ (that is, where their making would have\nconstituted an infringement if the U.

See Copyright Act of 1976, §602(a), 90 Stat.\n2589–2590.

Another option is a rule of international\nexhaustion, under which the authorized distribution of a\nparticular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copy­\nright owner’s distribution right everywhere with respect\nto that copy. See ibid. The European Union has adopted\nthe intermediate approach of regional exhaustion, under\nwhich the sale of a copy anywhere within the European\nEconomic Area exhausts the copyright owner’s distribu­\ntion right throughout that region. See id., at 430, 445.\nSection 602(a)(1), in my view, ties the United States to a\nnational-exhaustion framework. The Court’s decision, in con-\ntrast, places the United States solidly in the international­\nexhaustion camp.\n   Strong arguments have been made both in favor of, and\nin opposition to, international exhaustion. See Chiappetta\n360 (“[r]easonable people making valid points can, and\ndo, reach conflicting conclusions” regarding the desirability\nof international exhaustion). International exhaustion\nsubjects copyright-protected goods to competition from\nlower priced imports and, to that extent, benefits con-\nsumers. Correspondingly, copyright owners profit from a\nnational-exhaustion regime, which also enlarges the mon­\netary incentive to create new copyrightable works. See\nForsyth & Rothnie 432–437 (surveying arguments for and\nagainst international exhaustion).\n   Weighing the competing policy concerns, our Govern­\nment reached the conclusion that widespread adoption of\nthe international-exhaustion framework would be incon­\nsistent with the long-term economic interests of the United\nStates.

Quality King, I acknowledge, discounted\nthe Government’s concerns about potential inconsistency\nwith United States obligations under certain bilateral\ntrade agreements. See 523 U. S., at 153–154. See also\nQuality King Brief 22–24 (listing the agreements). That\ndecision, however, dealt only with copyright-protected\nproducts made in the United States. See 523 U.

S. copyrights could retain\ncontrol over the importation of copies manufactured and\nsold abroad—a point the Court obscures, see ante, at 33\n(arguing that Quality King “significantly eroded” the\nnational-exhaustion principle that, in my view, §602(a)(1)\nembraces). The Court today answers that question with a\nresounding “no,” and in doing so, it risks undermining the\nUnited States’ credibility on the world stage. While the\nGovernment has urged our trading partners to refrain\nfrom adopting international-exhaustion regimes that could\nbenefit consumers within their borders but would impact\nadversely on intellectual-property producers in the United\nStates, the Court embraces an international-exhaustion\nrule that could benefit U.

See Forsyth & Rothnie 435\n(“Parallel importation restrictions enable manufacturers\nand distributors to erect ‘vertical restraints’ in the market\nthrough exclusive distribution agreements.”). See gener-\nally Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,\n551 U. S. 877 (2007) (discussing vertical restraints).

Ante, at 22\n(internal quotation marks omitted). If §109(a) excluded\nforeign-made copies, the Court fears, then copyright own­\ners could exercise perpetual control over the downstream\ndistribution or public display of such copies. A ruling in\nWiley’s favor, the Court asserts, would shutter libraries,\nput used-book dealers out of business, cripple art muse­\nums, and prevent the resale of a wide range of consumer\ngoods, from cars to calculators.

At that time, no statutory provision\nexpressly codified the first sale doctrine. Instead, copy­\nright law merely provided that copyright owners had “the\nsole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing,\ncopying, executing, finishing, and vending” their works.\nCopyright Act of 1891, §1, 26 Stat. 1107.\n   In Bobbs-Merrill, the Court addressed the scope of the\nstatutory right to “ven[d].” In granting that right, the\nCourt held, Congress did not intend to permit copyright\nowners “to fasten . . . a restriction upon the subsequent\nalienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the\nowner had parted with the title to one who had acquired\nfull dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for\nit.” 210 U. S., at 349–350. “[O]ne who has sold a copy­\nrighted article . . . without restriction,” the Court ex­\nplained, “has parted with all right to control the sale of it.”\nId., at 350. Thus, “[t]he purchaser of a book, once sold by\nauthority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again,\nalthough he could not publish a new edition of it.” Ibid.\n   Under the logic of Bobbs-Merrill, the sale of a foreign­\nmanufactured copy in the United States carried out with\nthe copyright owner’s authorization would exhaust the\ncopyright owner’s right to “vend” that copy. The copy\ncould thenceforth be resold, lent out, or otherwise redis­\ntributed without further authorization from the copyright\nowner. Although §106(3) uses the word “distribute” rather\nthan “vend,” there is no reason to think Congress intended\nthe word “distribute” to bear a meaning different from the\nconstruction the Court gave to the word “vend” in Bobbs-\nMerrill. See ibid. (emphasizing that the question before\nthe Court was “purely [one] of statutory construction”).19\n——————\n  19 It appears that the Copyright Act of 1976 omitted the word “vend”\n\nand introduced the word “distribute” to avoid the “redundan[cy]”\npresent in pre-1976 law.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThus, in accord with Bobbs-Merrill, the first authorized\ndistribution of a foreign-made copy in the United States\nexhausts the copyright owner’s distribution right under\n§106(3). After such an authorized distribution, a library\nmay lend, or a used-book dealer may resell, the foreign­\nmade copy without seeking the copyright owner’s permis­\nsion. Cf. ante, at 19–21.\n   For example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had\nimported into the United States and then sold the foreign­\nmade textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley’s §106(3) dis­\ntribution right would have been exhausted under the\nrationale of Bobbs-Merrill. Purchasers of the textbooks\nwould thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished\nwithout first gaining a license from Wiley.\n   This line of reasoning, it must be acknowledged, signifi­\ncantly curtails the independent effect of §109(a). If, as I\nmaintain, the term “distribute” in §106(3) incorporates the\nfirst sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then\n§109(a)’s codification of that doctrine adds little to the\nregulatory regime.20 Section 109(a), however, does serve\n——————\nthat the exclusive rights to “publish” and “vend” works under the\nCopyright Act of 1947, §1(a), 61 Stat. 652–653, were “redundant”).\n  20 My position that Bobbs-Merrill lives on as a limiting construction of\n\nthe §106(3) distribution right does not leave §109(a) with no work to do.\nThere can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were\npublished and first sold in the United States.

Congress first codified the first\nsale doctrine in §41 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat.\n1084.21 It did so, the House Committee Report on the\n1909 Act explains, “in order to make . . . clear that [Con­\ngress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the\nconstruction to be given to the word ‘vend.’ ” H. R. Rep.\nNo. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909). According to the\nCommittee Report, §41 was “not intended to change [exist­\ning law] in any way.” Ibid. The position I have stated and\nexplained accords with this expression of congressional\nintent. In enacting §41 and its successors, I would hold,\nCongress did not “change . . . existing law,” ibid., by strip­\nping the word “vend” (and thus its substitute “distribute”)\nof the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.\n   In any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which\nI subscribe honors Congress’ aim in enacting §109(a)\nwhile the Court’s reading of the Act severely diminishes\n§602(a)(1)’s role. See supra, at 10–12. My position in no\nway tugs against the principle underlying §109(a)—i.e.,\nthat certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the\n——————\nStates with the copyright owner’s permission, not when it is distributed\nabroad. But under §109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any author­\nized distribution of a U. S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in\na foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner’s distribution right\nunder §106(3). See 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14. Section 109(a) therefore\nprovides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.\n   21 Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: “[N]othing in this Act shall be\n\ndeemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a\ncopyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.”\n35 Stat. 1084. This language was repeated without material change in\n§27 of the Copyright Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 660. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 2, 17 U. S. C. §109(a) sets out the current codification of the\nfirst sale doctrine.\n28           KIRTSAENG v.

Id., at 11–13.24\n   Limiting §109(c) to U. S.-made works, however, does not\nbar art museums from lawfully displaying works made in\nother countries. Museums can, of course, seek the copy­\nright owner’s permission to display a work. Furthermore,\nthe sale of a work of art to a U. S. museum may carry with\nit an implied license to publicly display the work.

Argued October 29, 2012—Decided March 19, 2013\nThe “exclusive rights” that a copyright owner has “to distribute copies\n  . . . of [a] copyrighted work,” 17 U. S. C. §106(3), are qualified by the\n  application of several limitations set out in §§107 through 122, in-\n  cluding the “first sale” doctrine, which provides that “the owner of a\n  particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is\n  entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or oth-\n  erwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord,” §109(a).\n  Importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owner’s permis-\n  sion is an infringement of §106(3). See §602(a)(1). In Quality King\n  Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research Int’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145,\n  this Court held that §602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3) incorporates the\n  §§107 through 122 limitations, including §109’s “first sale” doctrine.\n  However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the\n  United States and then sent abroad and sold.\n      Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., an academic textbook pub-\n  lisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley\n  Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wiley’s Eng-\n  lish language textbooks abroad. Wiley Asia’s books state that they\n  are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.\n  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States\n  to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edi-\n  tion English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold\n  at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States. He then\n  sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the\n  profit.\n      Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng’s unauthorized importa-\n  tion and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley’s §106(3)\n2             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    exclusive right to distribute and §602’s import prohibition. Kirtsaeng\n    replied that because his books were “lawfully made” and acquired le-\n    gitimately, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine permitted importation and\n    resale without Wiley’s further permission. The District Court held\n    that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine\n    does not apply to goods manufactured abroad. The jury then found\n    that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley’s American copyrights\n    and assessed damages. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n    §109(a)’s “lawfully made under this title” language indicated that the\n    “first sale” doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted\n    works manufactured abroad.\nHeld: The “first sale” doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work\n lawfully made abroad. Pp. 7–33.\n    (a) Wiley reads “lawfully made under this title” to impose a geo-\n graphical limitation that prevents §109(a)’s doctrine from applying to\n Wiley Asia’s books. Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as impos-\n ing the non-geographical limitation made “in accordance with” or “in\n compliance with” the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine\n to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner’s\n permission. Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Section 109(a)’s language, its context, and the “first sale” doc-\n trine’s common-law history favor Kirtsaeng’s reading. Pp. 8–24.\n      (1) Section 109(a) says nothing about geography. “Under” can\n logically mean “in accordance with.” And a nongeographical inter-\n pretation provides each word in the phrase “lawfully made under this\n title” with a distinct purpose: “lawfully made” suggests an effort to\n distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,\n and “under this title” sets forth the standard of “lawful[ness]” (i.e.,\n the U. S. Copyright Act). This simple reading promotes the tradi-\n tional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-\n word linguistic sense.\n    In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic\n difficulties. Wiley first reads “under” to mean “in conformance with\n the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.” Wiley then\n argues that the Act “is applicable” only in the United States. Howev-\n er, neither “under” nor any other word in “lawfully made under this\n title” means “where.” Nor can a geographical limitation be read into\n the word “applicable.” The fact that the Act does not instantly pro-\n tect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking\n place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made\n abroad. Indeed, §602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies sub-\n ject to the Copyright Act. And §104 says that works “subject to pro-\n tection” include unpublished works “without regard to the [author’s]\n nationality or domicile,” and works “first published” in any of the\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nnearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the\nUnited States. Pp. 8–12.\n     (2) Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate\nthat Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the pre-\nsent version of §109(a). A comparison of the language in §109(a)’s\npredecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion. The\nformer version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but\nmere possessors who “lawfully obtained” a copy, while the present\nversion covers only owners of a “lawfully made” copy. This new lan-\nguage, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who owns a copy\nwill be protected, provided that the copy was “lawfully made.” A\nnongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions\nof the present statute. For example, the “manufacturing clause,”\nwhich limited importation of many copies printed outside the United\nStates, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies\nmade in America and copies made abroad. But that “equal treat-\nment” principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpreta-\ntion that would grant an American copyright holder permanent con-\ntrol over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed\nabroad but not those printed in America. Finally, the Court normally\npresumes that the words “lawfully made under this title” carry the\nsame meaning when they appear in different but related sections,\nand it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the conse-\nquences produced by a geographical interpretation. Pp. 12–16.\n     (3) A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of\nstatutory interpretation that “when a statute covers an issue previ-\nously governed by the common law,” it is presumed that “Congress\nintended to retain the substance of the common law.” Samantar v.\nYousuf, 560 U. S. ___, ___. The common-law “first sale” doctrine,\nwhich has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical\ndistinctions. Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co.\nv. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, where this Court first applied the “first sale”\ndoctrine, or in §109(a)’s predecessor provision, which Congress enact-\ned a year later. Pp. 17–19.\n     (4) Library associations, used-book dealers, technology compa-\nnies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways\nin which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic\nconstitutional copyright objectives, in particular “promot[ing] the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts,” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. For example, a\ngeographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely re-\nquire libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books\nin their collections that were printed overseas. Wiley counters that\nsuch problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court\n4             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    first adopted a geographical interpretation. But the law has not been\n    settled for so long in Wiley’s favor. The Second Circuit in this case\n    was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical inter-\n    pretation. Reliance on the “first sale” doctrine is also deeply embed-\n    ded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers,\n    who have long relied on its protection. And the fact that harm has\n    proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright\n    holders to assert geographically based resale rights. Thus, the prac-\n    tical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,\n    extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant—\n    particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade\n    to America. Pp. 19–24.\n       (c) Several additional arguments that Wiley and the dissent make\n    in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants “the owner of\ncopyright under this title” certain “exclusive rights,”\nincluding the right “to distribute copies . . . of the copy­\nrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of\nownership.” 17 U. S. C. §106(3). These rights are quali­\nfied, however, by the application of various limitations set\nforth in the next several sections of the Act, §§107 through\n122. Those sections, typically entitled “Limitations on\nexclusive rights,” include, for example, the principle of\n“fair use” (§107), permission for limited library archival\nreproduction, (§108), and the doctrine at issue here, the\n“first sale” doctrine (§109).\n   Section 109(a) sets forth the “first sale” doctrine as\nfollows:\n    “Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3) [the\n    section that grants the owner exclusive distribution\n    rights], the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord\n    lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without\n    the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or other­\n    wise dispose of the possession of that copy or\n2          KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    phonorecord.” (Emphasis added.)\nThus, even though §106(3) forbids distribution of a copy of,\nsay, the copyrighted novel Herzog without the copyright\nowner’s permission, §109(a) adds that, once a copy of Her-\nzog has been lawfully sold (or its ownership otherwise\nlawfully transferred), the buyer of that copy and subse­\nquent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish. In\ncopyright jargon, the “first sale” has “exhausted” the\ncopyright owner’s §106(3) exclusive distribution right.\n   What, however, if the copy of Herzog was printed abroad\nand then initially sold with the copyright owner’s permis­\nsion? Does the “first sale” doctrine still apply? Is the\nbuyer, like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,\nfree to bring the copy into the United States and dispose of\nit as he or she wishes?\n   To put the matter technically, an “importation” provi­\nsion, §602(a)(1), says that\n    “[i]mportation into the United States, without the au­\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies . . . of a work that have been acquired outside\n    the United States is an infringement of the exclusive\n    right to distribute copies . . . under section 106 . . . .”\n    17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis\n    added).\n   Thus §602(a)(1) makes clear that importing a copy\nwithout permission violates the owner’s exclusive distri-\nbution right. But in doing so, §602(a)(1) refers explicitly to\nthe §106(3) exclusive distribution right. As we have just\nsaid, §106 is by its terms “[s]ubject to” the various doc­\ntrines and principles contained in §§107 through 122, in-\ncluding §109(a)’s “first sale” limitation. Do those same\nmodifications apply—in particular, does the “first sale”\nmodification apply—when considering whether §602(a)(1)\nprohibits importing a copy?\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v.

S. 135, 145 (1998), we held that\n§602(a)(1)’s reference to §106(3)’s exclusive distribution\nright incorporates the later subsections’ limitations, in­\ncluding, in particular, the “first sale” doctrine of §109.\nThus, it might seem that, §602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one\nwho buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into\nthe United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he\nbought the copy in the United States.\n  But Quality King considered an instance in which the\ncopy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufac­\ntured in the United States (and then sent abroad and\nsold). This case is like Quality King but for one important\nfact. The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.\nThat fact is important because §109(a) says that the “first\nsale” doctrine applies to “a particular copy or phonorecord\nlawfully made under this title.” And we must decide here\nwhether the five words, “lawfully made under this title,”\nmake a critical legal difference.\n  Putting section numbers to the side, we ask whether\nthe “first sale” doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other\nlawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully\nmanufactured abroad. Can that buyer bring that copy\ninto the United States (and sell it or give it away) without\nobtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner?\nCan, for example, someone who purchases, say at a used\nbookstore, a book printed abroad subsequently resell it\nwithout the copyright owner’s permission?\n  In our view, the answers to these questions are, yes. We\nhold that the “first sale” doctrine applies to copies of a\ncopyrighted work lawfully made abroad.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publishes aca-\ndemic textbooks.

Walker, Fundamentals of Physics, p. vi (8th ed. 2008).\nA copy of Wiley Asia’s Asian edition of that book says:\n    “Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Pte\n    Ltd[.] All rights reserved. This book is authorized for\n    sale in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East only\n    and may be not exported out of these territories.

(Int’l ed.), with Walker, supra, at\n    vi (American ed.).\n  The upshot is that there are two essentially equivalent\nversions of a Wiley textbook, 654 F. 3d, at 213, each ver­\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

And Wiley makes certain that copies of the second\nversion state that they are not to be taken (without per­\nmission) into the United States. Ibid.\n   Petitioner, Supap Kirtsaeng, a citizen of Thailand,\nmoved to the United States in 1997 to study mathemat-\nics at Cornell University. Ibid.

Kirtsaeng successfully\ncompleted his undergraduate courses at Cornell, success­\nfully completed a Ph. D. program in mathematics at the\nUniversity of Southern California, and then, as promised,\nreturned to Thailand to teach. Ibid. While he was study­\ning in the United States, Kirtsaeng asked his friends and\nfamily in Thailand to buy copies of foreign edition English­\nlanguage textbooks at Thai book shops, where they sold at\nlow prices, and mail them to him in the United States.\nId., at 7–8. Kirtsaeng would then sell them, reimburse\nhis family and friends, and keep the profit.

Kirtsaeng replied that the books he had\nacquired were “ ‘lawfully made’ ” and that he had acquired\nthem legitimately. Record in No. 1:08–CV–7834–DCP\n6         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(SDNY), Doc. 14, p. 3. Thus, in his view, §109(a)’s “first\nsale” doctrine permitted him to resell or otherwise dispose\nof the books without the copyright owner’s further permis­\nsion. Id., at 2–3.\n   The District Court held that Kirtsaeng could not assert\nthe “first sale” defense because, in its view, that doctrine\ndoes not apply to “foreign-manufactured goods” (even if\nmade abroad with the copyright owner’s permission). App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 72a. The jury then found that Kirtsaeng\nhad willfully infringed Wiley’s American copyrights by\nselling and importing without authorization copies of eight\nof Wiley’s copyrighted titles. And it assessed statutory\ndamages of $600,000 ($75,000 per work). 654 F. 3d, at\n215.\n   On appeal, a split panel of the Second Circuit agreed\nwith the District Court. Id., at 222. It pointed out that\n§109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine applies only to “the owner of\na particular copy . . . lawfully made under this title.” Id.,\nat 218–219 (emphasis added). And, in the majority’s view,\nthis language means that the “first sale” doctrine does not\napply to copies of American copyrighted works manufac­\ntured abroad. Id., at 221. A dissenting judge thought that\nthe words “lawfully made under this title” do not refer “to\na place of manufacture” but rather “focu[s] on whether a\nparticular copy was manufactured lawfully under” Amer-\nica’s copyright statute, and that “the lawfulness of the\nmanufacture of a particular copy should be judged by U. S.\ncopyright law.” Id., at 226 (opinion of Murtha, J.).\n   We granted Kirtsaeng’s petition for certiorari to con-\nsider this question in light of different views among the\nCircuits. Compare id., at 221 (case below) (“first sale”\ndoctrine does not apply to copies manufactured outside the\nUnited States), with Omega S. A. v.

Consumer Contacts\n(PTY) Ltd., 847 F. 2d 1093, 1098, n. 1 (CA3 1988) (limita­\ntion of the first sale doctrine to copies made within the\nUnited States “does not fit comfortably within the scheme\nof the Copyright Act”).\n                              II\n   We must decide whether the words “lawfully made\nunder this title” restrict the scope of §109(a)’s “first sale”\ndoctrine geographically. The Second Circuit, the Ninth\nCircuit, Wiley, and the Solicitor General (as amicus) all\nread those words as imposing a form of geographical limi­\ntation. The Second Circuit held that they limit the “first\nsale” doctrine to particular copies “made in territories in\nwhich the Copyright Act is law,” which (the Circuit says)\nare copies “manufactured domestically,” not “outside of the\nUnited States.” 654 F. 3d, at 221–222 (emphasis added).\nWiley agrees that those five words limit the “first sale”\ndoctrine “to copies made in conformance with the [United\nStates] Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is appli­\ncable,” which (Wiley says) means it does not apply to copies\nmade “outside the United States” and at least not to “for­\neign production of a copy for distribution exclusively\nabroad.” Brief for Respondent 15–16. Similarly, the\nSolicitor General says that those five words limit the “first\nsale” doctrine’s applicability to copies “ ‘made subject to\nand in compliance with [the Copyright Act],’ ” which (the\nSolicitor General says) are copies “made in the United\nStates.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5\n(hereinafter Brief for United States) (emphasis added).\nAnd the Ninth Circuit has held that those words limit the\n“first sale” doctrine’s applicability (1) to copies lawfully\nmade in the United States, and (2) to copies lawfully made\noutside the United States but initially sold in the United\nStates with the copyright owner’s permission. Denbicare\n8         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Toys “R” Us, Inc., 84 F. 3d 1143, 1149–1150\n(1996).\n   Under any of these geographical interpretations,\n§109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine would not apply to the Wiley\nAsia books at issue here. And, despite an American copy­\nright owner’s permission to make copies abroad, one who\nbuys a copy of any such book or other copyrighted work—\nwhether at a retail store, over the Internet, or at a library\nsale—could not resell (or otherwise dispose of) that partic­\nular copy without further permission.\n   Kirtsaeng, however, reads the words “lawfully made\nunder this title” as imposing a non-geographical limita­\ntion. He says that they mean made “in accordance with”\nor “in compliance with” the Copyright Act. Brief for Peti­\ntioner 26. In that case, §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine\nwould apply to copyrighted works as long as their manu­\nfacture met the requirements of American copyright law.\nIn particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here,\ncopies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the\ncopyright owner. See §106 (referring to the owner’s right\nto authorize).\n   In our view, §109(a)’s language, its context, and the\ncommon-law history of the “first sale” doctrine, taken\ntogether, favor a non-geographical interpretation. We also\ndoubt that Congress would have intended to create the\npractical copyright-related harms with which a geograph­\nical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,\nartistic, commercial, and consumer activities. See Part II–\nD, infra. We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng’s\nnongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.\n                            A\n  The language of §109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng’s\nnongeographical interpretation, namely, that “lawfully\nmade under this title” means made “in accordance with” or\n“in compliance with” the Copyright Act. The language of\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n§109(a) says nothing about geography. The word “under”\ncan mean “[i]n accordance with.” 18 Oxford English Dic­\ntionary 950 (2d ed. 1989). See also Black’s Law Dictionary\n1525 (6th ed. 1990) (“according to”). And a nongeograph­\nical interpretation provides each word of the five-word\nphrase with a distinct purpose. The first two words of the\nphrase, “lawfully made,” suggest an effort to distinguish\nthose copies that were made lawfully from those that were\nnot, and the last three words, “under this title,” set forth\nthe standard of “lawful[ness].” Thus, the nongeograph-\nical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright\nobjective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word\nlinguistic sense.\n   The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with\nlinguistic difficulties. It gives the word “lawfully” little,\nif any, linguistic work to do. (How could a book be unlaw­\nfully “made under this title”?) It imports geography into a\nstatutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.\nAnd it is far more complex than may at first appear.\n   To read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec­\nond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first empha­\nsize the word “under.” Indeed, Wiley reads “under this\ntitle” to mean “in conformance with the Copyright Act\nwhere the Copyright Act is applicable.” Brief for Respond­\nent 15. Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that\nthe Act “is applicable” only in the United States. Ibid.\nAnd the Solicitor General must do the same. See Brief for\nUnited States 6 (“A copy is ‘lawfully made under this title’\nif Title 17 governs the copy’s creation and the copy is made\nin compliance with Title 17’s requirements”). See also\npost, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (“under” describes\nsomething “governed or regulated by another”).\n    One difficulty is that neither “under” nor any other\nword in the phrase means “where.” See, e.g., 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, supra, at 947–952 (definition of “un­\nder”). It might mean “subject to,” see post, at 6, but as this\n10        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a\nuniform, consistent meaning. See Kucana v. Holder, 558\nU. S. 233, 245 (2010) (“ ‘under’ is chameleon”); Ardestani v.\nINS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (“under” has “many dic­\ntionary definitions” and “must draw its meaning from its\ncontext”).\n   A far more serious difficulty arises out of the uncer­\ntainty and complexity surrounding the second step’s effort\nto read the necessary geographical limitation into the word\n“applicable” (or the equivalent). Where, precisely, is the\nCopyright Act “applicable”? The Act does not instantly\nprotect an American copyright holder from unauthorized\npiracy taking place abroad. But that fact does not mean\nthe Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad. As a matter\nof ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing,\nsay, a tariff upon “any rhododendron grown in Nepal”\napplies to all Nepalese rhododendrons. And, similarly,\none can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable\nto all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.\nIndeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor\nGeneral’s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are “sub­\nject to” the Act. §602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer-\nring to importation of copies “the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would\nhave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title\nhad been applicable”); Brief for United States 5. See also\npost, at 6 (suggesting that “made under” may be read as\n“subject to”).\n   The appropriateness of this linguistic usage is under­\nscored by the fact that §104 of the Act itself says that\nworks “subject to protection under this title” include un­\npublished works “without regard to the nationality or\ndomicile of the author,” and works “first published” in any\none of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright\ntreaty with the United States. §§104(a), (b) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added); §101 (2006 ed., Supp. V) (defining\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“treaty party”); U. S. Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A,\nInternational Copyright Relations of the United States\n(2010). Thus, ordinary English permits us to say that the\nAct “applies” to an Irish manuscript lying in its author’s\nDublin desk drawer as well as to an original recording of\na ballet performance first made in Japan and now on\ndisplay in a Kyoto art gallery. Cf. 4 M. Nimmer & D.\nNimmer, Copyright §17.02, pp. 17–18, 17–19 (2012) (herein­\nafter Nimmer on Copyright) (noting that the principle that\n“copyright laws do not have any extraterritorial operation”\n“requires some qualification”).\n   The Ninth Circuit’s geographical interpretation pro-\nduces still greater linguistic difficulty. As we said, that Cir­\ncuit interprets the “first sale” doctrine to cover both (1)\ncopies manufactured in the United States and (2) copies\nmanufactured abroad but first sold in the United States\nwith the American copyright owner’s permission. Den­\nbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d, at 1149–1150. See also Brief\nfor Respondent 16 (suggesting that the clause at least\nexcludes “the foreign production of a copy for distribution\nexclusively abroad”); id., at 51 (the Court need “not de-\ncide whether the copyright owner would be able to restrict\nfurther distribution” in the case of “a downstream domes­\ntic purchaser of authorized imports”); Brief for Petitioner\nin Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S. A., O. T. 2010,\nNo. 08–1423, p. 12 (excepting imported copies “made by\nunrelated foreign copyright holders” (emphasis deleted)).\n   We can understand why the Ninth Circuit may have\nthought it necessary to add the second part of its defini­\ntion. As we shall later describe, see Part II–D, infra,\nwithout some such qualification a copyright holder could\nprevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving\naway copies of a video game made in Japan, a film made\nin Germany, or a dress (with a design copyright) made in\nChina, even if the copyright holder has granted permission\nfor the foreign manufacture, importation, and an initial\n12         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic sale of the copy. A publisher such as Wiley\nwould be free to print its books abroad, allow their im-\nportation and sale within the United States, but prohibit\nstudents from later selling their used texts at a campus\nbookstore. We see no way, however, to reconcile this half­\ngeographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the\nlanguage of the phrase, “lawfully made under this title.”\nAs a matter of English, it would seem that those five\nwords either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they\ndo not.\n   In sum, we believe that geographical interpretations\ncreate more linguistic problems than they resolve. And\nconsiderations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely\nlinguistic balance in Kirtsaeng’s, nongeographical, favor.\n                           B\n  Both historical and contemporary statutory context in­\ndicate that Congress, when writing the present version of\n§109(a), did not have geography in mind. In respect to\nhistory, we compare §109(a)’s present language with the\nlanguage of its immediate predecessor. That predecessor\nsaid:\n     “[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, pre­\n     vent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copy­\n     righted work the possession of which has been lawfully\n     obtained.” Copyright Act of 1909, §41, 35 Stat. 1084\n     (emphasis added).\n  See also Copyright Act of 1947, §27, 61 Stat. 660. The\npredecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does\nnot argue that it does). So we ask whether Congress, in\nchanging its language implicitly introduced a geograph-\nical limitation that previously was lacking. See also Part\nII–C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law\nprinciple).\n  A comparison of language indicates that it did not. The\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor says that the “first sale” doctrine protects “the\ntransfer of any copy the possession of which has been\nlawfully obtained.” The present version says that “the\nowner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\nunder this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of\nthe possession of that copy or phonorecord.” What does\nthis change in language accomplish?\n   The language of the former version referred to those\nwho are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who\n“lawfully obtained” a copy. The present version covers\nonly those who are owners of a “lawfully made” copy.\nWhom does the change leave out? Who might have law-\nfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned\nthat copy? One answer is owners of movie theaters, who\nduring the 1970’s (and before) often leased films from\nmovie distributors or filmmakers.         See S. Donahue,\nAmerican Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing\nproducer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements);\nNote, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribu­\ntion and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of Anti-\nBlind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L. J. 131, 135\n(1986). Because the theater owners had “lawfully ob­\ntained” their copies, the earlier version could be read as\nallowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given\nthem “first sale” protection. Because the theater owners\nwere lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in\nlanguage makes clear that they (like bailees and other\nlessees) cannot take advantage of the “first sale” doctrine.\n(Those who find legislative history useful will find confir­\nmation in, e.g., House Committee on the Judiciary, Copy­\nright Law Revision, Supplementary Report of the Register\nof Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copy­\nright Law: 1965 Revision Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt.\n6, p. 30 (Comm. Print 1965) (hereinafter Copyright Law\nRevision) (“[W]here a person has rented a print of a mo­\ntion picture from the copyright owner, he would have no\n14         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nright to lend, rent, sell, or otherwise dispose of the print\nwithout first obtaining the copyright owner’s permission”).\nSee also Platt & Munk Co. v. Republic Graphics, Inc.,\n315 F. 2d 847, 851 (CA2 1963) (Friendly, J.) (pointing out\npredecessor statute’s leasing problem)).\n    This objective perfectly well explains the new language\nof the present version, including the five words here at\nissue. Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive “first sale” protection but one who\nowns a copy will receive “first sale” protection, provided, of\ncourse, that the copy was “lawfully made” and not pi-\nrated. The new language also takes into account that a\ncopy may be “lawfully made under this title” when the copy,\nsay of a phonorecord, comes into its owner’s possession\nthrough use of a compulsory license, which “this title”\nprovides for elsewhere, namely, in §115. Again, for those\nwho find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative\nreport makes this clear. H. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, p. 79\n(1976) (“For example, any resale of an illegally ‘pirated’\nphonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition\nof a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory li­\ncensing provisions of section 115 would not”).\n    Other provisions of the present statute also support\na nongeographical interpretation. For one thing, the stat­\nute phases out the “manufacturing clause,” a clause that\nappeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation\nof many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the\nUnited States. §601, 90 Stat. 2588 (“Prior to July 1, 1982\n. . . the importation into or public distribution in the\nUnited States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly\nof nondramatic literary material . . . is prohibited unless\nthe portions consisting of such material have been manufac-\ntured in the United States or Canada”). The phasing out\nof this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manu­\nfactured in America and copies manufactured abroad. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 94–1476, at 165–166.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The “equal treatment” principle, however, is difficult\nto square with a geographical interpretation of the “first\nsale” clause that would grant the holder of an American\ncopyright (perhaps a foreign national, see supra, at 10)\npermanent control over the American distribution chain\n(sales, resales, gifts, and other distribution) in respect to\ncopies printed abroad but not in respect to copies printed\nin America. And it is particularly difficult to believe that\nCongress would have sought this unequal treatment while\nsaying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the\nmanufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of\npolicy goal. Cf. Golan v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 30) (Congress has moved from a copyright\nregime that, prior to 1891, entirely excluded foreign works\nfrom U. S. copyright protection to a regime that now “en­\nsure[s] that most works, whether foreign or domestic,\nwould be governed by the same legal regime” (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Finally, we normally presume that the words “lawfully\nmade under this title” carry the same meaning when they\nappear in different but related sections. Department of\nRevenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,\n342 (1994). But doing so here produces surprising conse­\nquences. Consider:\n\n  (1) Section 109(c) says that, despite the copyright own­\n  er’s exclusive right “to display” a copyrighted work\n  (provided in §106(5)), the owner of a particular copy “law-\n  fully made under this title” may publicly display it with­\n  out further authorization. To interpret these words\n  geographically would mean that one who buys a copy­\n  righted work of art, a poster, or even a bumper sticker,\n  in Canada, in Europe, in Asia, could not display\n  it in America without the copyright owner’s further\n  authorization.\n16           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     (2) Section 109(e) specifically provides that the owner\n     of a particular copy of a copyrighted video arcade game\n     “lawfully made under this title” may “publicly perform\n     or display that game in coin-operated equipment” with­\n     out the authorization of the copyright owner. To inter­\n     pret these words geographically means that an arcade\n     owner could not (“without the authority of the copyright\n     owner”) perform or display arcade games (whether new\n     or used) originally made in Japan. Cf. Red Baron-\n     Franklin Park, Inc. v. Taito Corp., 883 F. 2d 275 (CA4\n     1989).\n\n     (3) Section 110(1) says that a teacher, without the copy­\n     right owner’s authorization, is allowed to perform or\n     display a copyrighted work (say, an audiovisual work)\n     “in the course of face-to-face teaching activities”—unless\n     the teacher knowingly used “a copy that was not law-\n     fully made under this title.” To interpret these words\n     geographically would mean that the teacher could not\n     (without further authorization) use a copy of a film dur­\n     ing class if the copy was lawfully made in Canada, Mex­\n     ico, Europe, Africa, or Asia.\n\n     (4) In its introductory sentence, §106 provides the Act’s\n     basic exclusive rights to an “owner of a copyright under\n     this title.” The last three words cannot support a geo­\n     graphic interpretation.\n\nWiley basically accepts the first three readings, but ar-\ngues that Congress intended the restrictive consequences.\nAnd it argues that context simply requires that the words\nof the fourth example receive a different interpretation.\nLeaving the fourth example to the side, we shall explain in\nPart II–D, infra, why we find it unlikely that Congress\nwould have intended these, and other related consequences.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Yousuf, 560 U. S. ___,\n___, n. 13 (2010) (slip op., at 14, n. 13).       See also\nIsbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.

In the early 17th century\nLord Coke explained the common law’s refusal to permit\nrestraints on the alienation of chattels. Referring to Lit­\ntleton, who wrote in the 15th century, Gray, Two Contri­\nbutions to Coke Studies, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1127, 1135\n(2005), Lord Coke wrote:\n    “[If] a man be possessed of . . . a horse, or of any other\n    chattell . . . and give or sell his whole interest . . .\n    therein upon condition that the Donee or Vendee shall\n    not alien[ate] the same, the [condition] is voi[d], be­\n    cause his whole interest . . . is out of him, so as he\n    hath no possibilit[y] of a Reverter, and it is against\n    Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and contracting\n    betwee[n] man and man: and it is within the reason of\n    our Author that it should ouster him of all power\n    given to him.” 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of\n    England §360, p. 223 (1628).\n  A law that permits a copyright holder to control the\nresale or other disposition of a chattel once sold is simi-\nlarly “against Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and con-\ntracting.” Ibid.\n  With these last few words, Coke emphasizes the im­\n18         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nportance of leaving buyers of goods free to compete with\neach other when reselling or otherwise disposing of those\ngoods. American law too has generally thought that com­\npetition, including freedom to resell, can work to the ad­\nvantage of the consumer. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather\nProducts, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 886 (2007)\n(restraints with “manifestly anticompetitive effects” are\nper se illegal; others are subject to the rule of reason\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); 1 P. Areeda & H.\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶100, p. 4 (3d ed. 2006)\n(“[T]he principal objective of antitrust policy is to maximize\nconsumer welfare by encouraging firms to behave\ncompetitively”).\n   The “first sale” doctrine also frees courts from the ad­\nministrative burden of trying to enforce restrictions upon\ndifficult-to-trace, readily movable goods. And it avoids the\nselective enforcement inherent in any such effort. Thus, it\nis not surprising that for at least a century the “first sale”\ndoctrine has played an important role in American copy­\nright law. See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U. S. 339\n(1908); Copyright Act of 1909, §41, 35 Stat. 1084. See also\nCopyright Law Revision, Further Discussions and Com­\nments on Preliminary Draft for Revised U. S.

And we can find no language, context,\npurpose, or history that would rebut a “straightforward\napplication” of that doctrine here.\n   The dissent argues that another principle of statutory\ninterpretation works against our reading, and points out\nthat elsewhere in the statute Congress used different\nwords to express something like the non-geographical\nreading we adopt. Post, at 8–9 (quoting §602(a)(2) (prohib­\niting the importation of copies “the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would\nhave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title\nhad been applicable” (emphasis deleted))). Hence, Con­\ngress, the dissent believes, must have meant §109(a)’s\ndifferent language to mean something different (such as\nthe dissent’s own geographical interpretation of §109(a)).\nWe are not aware, however, of any canon of interpretation\nthat forbids interpreting different words used in different\nparts of the same statute to mean roughly the same thing.\nRegardless, were there such a canon, the dissent’s inter­\npretation of §109(a) would also violate it. That is because\nCongress elsewhere in the 1976 Act included the words\n“manufactured in the United States or Canada,” 90 Stat.\n2588, which express just about the same geographical\nthought that the dissent reads into §109(a)’s very different\nlanguage.\n                              D\n   Associations of libraries, used-book dealers, technology\ncompanies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point\nto various ways in which a geographical interpretation\nwould fail to further basic constitutional copyright objec­\ntives, in particular “promot[ing] the Progress of Science\nand useful Arts.” U.

See\nsupra, at 10 (describing how §104 often makes such works\n“subject to” American copyright protection). A geograph­\nical interpretation, they say, would require the museums\nto obtain permission from the copyright owners before\nthey could display the work, see supra, at 15—even if the\ncopyright owner has already sold or donated the work to\na foreign museum.

See also post, at 30–31.\n   We are less sanguine. For one thing, the law has not\nbeen settled for long in Wiley’s favor. The Second Circuit,\nin its decision below, is the first Court of Appeals to adopt\na purely geographical interpretation. The Third Circuit\nhas favored a nongeographical interpretation. Sebastian\nInt’l, 847 F. 2d 1093. The Ninth Circuit has favored a\nmodified geographical interpretation with a nongeograph­\nical (but textually unsustainable) corollary designed to\ndiminish the problem. Denbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d 1143.\nSee supra, at 11–12. And other courts have hesitated to\nadopt, and have cast doubt upon, the validity of the geo­\ngraphical interpretation. Pearson Educ., Inc. v. Liu, 656\nF. Supp. 2d 407 (SDNY 2009); Red-Baron Franklin Park,\nInc. v.

Museums, for example, are\nnot in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to\ncheck with the heirs of copyright owners before sending,\ne.g., a Picasso on tour. Brief for Association of Art Mu­\nseum Directors 11–12. That inertia means a dramatic\nchange is likely necessary before these institutions, in­\nstructed by their counsel, would begin to engage in the\ncomplex permission-verifying process that a geographical\ninterpretation would demand. And this Court’s adoption\nof the geographical interpretation could provide that\ndramatic change. These intolerable consequences (along\nwith the absurd result that the copyright owner can ex-\nercise downstream control even when it authorized the\nimport or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth\nCircuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to\n24        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to\nmitigate these harms. Brief for United States 27–28;\npost, at 24–28. But those readings are not defensible, for\nthey require too many unprecedented jumps over linguis­\ntic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.\nSee, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of\n§106(3) “significantly curtails the independent effect of\n§109(a)”).\n   Finally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far\nmay simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so\nfar to assert geographically based resale rights. They may\ndecide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.\nRegardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only\nif unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that\nwould create uncertainty, would bring about selective\nenforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disre­\nspect for copyright law itself.\n   Thus, we believe that the practical problems that peti­\ntioner and his amici have described are too serious, too\nextensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss\nthem as insignificant—particularly in light of the ever­\ngrowing importance of foreign trade to America. See\nThe World Bank, Imports of goods and services (% of\nGDP) (imports in 2011 18% of U. S. gross domestic\nproduct compared to 11% in 1980), online at http://\ndata.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.IMP.GNFS.ZS? (as visited\nMar. 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\nThe upshot is that copyright-related consequences along\nwith language, context, and interpretive canons argue\nstrongly against a geographical interpretation of §109(a).\n                            III\n  Wiley and the dissent make several additional impor­\ntant arguments in favor of the geographical interpretation.\nFirst, they say that our Quality King decision strongly\nsupports its geographical interpretation. In that case\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe asked whether the Act’s “importation provision,” now\n§602(a)(1) (then §602(a)), barred importation (without\npermission) of a copyrighted item (labels affixed to hair\ncare products) where an American copyright owner au­\nthorized the first sale and export of hair care products\nwith copyrighted labels made in the United States, and\nwhere a buyer sought to import them back into the United\nStates without the copyright owner’s permission. 523\nU. S., at 138–139.\n  We held that the importation provision did not prohibit\nsending the products back into the United States (without\nthe copyright owner’s permission). That section says:\n    “Importation into the United States, without the au­\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n    acquired outside the United States is an infringement\n    of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono­\n    records under section 106.” 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1)\n    (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See also\n    §602(a) (1994 ed.).\n   We pointed out that this section makes importation an\ninfringement of the “exclusive right to distribute . . . under\n106.” We noted that §109(a)’s “first sale” doctrine limits\nthe scope of the §106 exclusive distribution right. We took\nas given the fact that the products at issue had at least\nonce been sold. And we held that consequently, importa­\ntion of the copyrighted labels does not violate §602(a)(1).\n523 U. S., at 145.\n   In reaching this conclusion we endorsed Bobbs-Merrill\nand its statement that the copyright laws were not “in­\ntended to create a right which would permit the holder of\nthe copyright to fasten, by notice in a book . . . a restriction\nupon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of\ncopyright after the owner had parted with the title to one\nwho had acquired full dominion over it.” 210 U. S., at\n26        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n349–350.\n   We also explained why we rejected the claim that our\ninterpretation would make §602(a)(1) pointless. Those\nadvancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copy­\nright Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provi­\nsion, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies. Qual­\nity King, supra, at 146. Thus, they said, §602(a)(1) must\nprohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to\nallow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a\nfirst sale, as Quality King’s holding would do, would leave\n§602(a)(1) without much to prohibit. It would become\nsuperfluous, without any real work to do.\n   We do not believe that this argument is a strong one.\nUnder Quality King’s interpretation, §602(a)(1) would still\nforbid importing (without permission, and subject to the\nexceptions in §602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for\nexample, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the\nlicensee of an American publisher prints copies of a book\noverseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send\nthem to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other\nmanufacturer (if not the “owner” for purposes of §109(a),\ne.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted\ngoods to the United States; (3) “a book publisher trans­\nports copies to a wholesaler” and the wholesaler (not yet\nthe owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright\nLaw Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4)\na foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri-\nbution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to\nsend them to the United States. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on\nCopyright §8.12[B][1][a], at 8–159 (“Section 109(a) pro­\nvides that the distribution right may be exercised solely\nwith respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,\nnot to prevent or restrict the resale or other further trans­\nfer of possession of such copies”). These examples show\nthat §602(a)(1) retains significance. We concede it has less\nsignificance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent also adopts a construction of §106(3) that “signifi­\ncantly curtails” §109(a)’s effect, post, at 26, and so limits\nthe scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater,\ndegree.\n   In Quality King we rejected the “superfluous” argument\nfor similar reasons. But, when rejecting it, we said that,\nwhere an author gives exclusive American distribution\nrights to an American publisher and exclusive British\ndistribution rights to a British publisher, “presumably\nonly those [copies] made by the publisher of the United\nStates edition would be ‘lawfully made under this title’\nwithin the meaning of §109(a).” 523 U. S., at 148 (empha­\nsis added). Wiley now argues that this phrase in the\nQuality King opinion means that books published abroad\n(under license) must fall outside the words “lawfully made\nunder this title” and that we have consequently already\ngiven those words the geographical interpretation that it\nfavors.\n   We cannot, however, give the Quality King statement\nthe legal weight for which Wiley argues. The language\n“lawfully made under this title” was not at issue in Qual­\nity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued;\nwe did not canvas the considerations we have here set\nforth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example\nassumes a “first sale”; and we there hedged our state-\nment with the word “presumably.” Most importantly, the\nstatement is pure dictum. It is dictum contained in a\nrebuttal to a counterargument. And it is unnecessary\ndictum even in that respect. Is the Court having once\nwritten dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny\nthat it is a fruit forever after?\n   To the contrary, we have written that we are not neces­\nsarily bound by dicta should more complete argument\ndemonstrate that the dicta is not correct. Central Va.\nCommunity College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006)\n(“[W]e are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in\n28        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the point now at issue was not fully debated”);\nHumphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602,\n627–628 (1935) (rejecting, under stare decisis, dicta, “which\nmay be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are\nnot controlling”). And, given the bit part that our Quality\nKing statement played in our Quality King decision, we\nbelieve the view of stare decisis set forth in these opinions\napplies to the matter now before us.\n   Second, Wiley and the dissent argue (to those who con­\nsider legislative history) that the Act’s legislative history\nsupports their interpretation. But the historical events to\nwhich it points took place more than a decade before the\nenactment of the Act and, at best, are inconclusive.\n   During the 1960’s, representatives of book, record, and\nfilm industries, meeting with the Register of Copyrights to\ndiscuss copyright revision, complained about the difficulty\nof dividing international markets.

S. C. §501].” Id., Preliminary Draft for Revised\n    U. S. Copyright Law and Discussions and Comments,\n    88th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, pp. 32–33 (Comm. Print\n    1964).\n  In discussing the draft, some of those present expressed\nconcern about its effect on the “first sale” doctrine. For\nexample, Irwin Karp, representing the Authors League\nof America asked, “If a German jobber lawfully buys cop-\nies from a German publisher, are we not running into the\nproblem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained\ncopies?” Id., pt. 4, at 211. The Copyright Office repre­\nsentative replied, “This could vary from one situation to\nanother, I guess. I should guess, for example, that if\na book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a\nwholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of\ntransaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.”\nIbid. (emphasis added).\n  The Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a\ndraft, which, by explicitly referring to §106, was similar to\nthe provision that became law, now §602(a)(1). The Office\nnoted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of\na copy (without permission) “would violate the exclusive\nrights of the U. S. copyright owner . . . where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign\ncountry for distribution only in that country.” Id., pt. 6, at\n150.\n  Still, that part of the report says nothing about the “first\nsale” doctrine, about §109(a), or about the five words,\n30         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n“lawfully made under this title.” And neither the report\nnor its accompanying 1960’s draft answers the question\nbefore us here. Cf. Quality King, 523 U. S., at 145 (with­\nout those five words, the import clause, via its reference to\n§106, imports the “first sale” doctrine).\n   But to ascertain the best reading of §109(a), rather\nthan dissecting the remarks of industry representatives\nconcerning §602 at congressional meetings held 10 years\nbefore the statute was enacted, see post, at 13–16, we\nwould give greater weight to the congressional report\naccompanying §109(a), written a decade later when Con­\ngress passed the new law. That report says:\n       “Section 109(a) restates and confirms the principle\n     that, where the copyright owner has transferred own­\n     ership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work,\n     the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is trans­\n     ferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any\n     other means. Under this principle, which has been\n     established by the court decisions and . . . the present\n     law, the copyright owner’s exclusive right of public\n     distribution would have no effect upon anyone who\n     owns ‘a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\n     under this title’ and who wishes to transfer it to\n     someone else or to destroy it.\n      .             .               .          .             .\n        “To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy\n     or phonorecord must have been ‘lawfully made under\n     this title,’ though not necessarily with the copyright\n     owner’s authorization. For example, any resale of an\n     illegally ‘pirated’ phonorecord would be an infringe­\n     ment but the disposition of a phonorecord legally\n     made under the compulsory licensing provisions of\n     section 115 would not.” H.

No. 94–473, pp. 71–72 (1975).\n   This history reiterates the importance of the “first sale”\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Copyright Law Revision, 1964 Revision\nBill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess., pt. 5, p. 66 (Comm. Print 1965) (“[F]ull ownership of\na lawfully-made copy authorizes its owner to dispose of\nit freely”). It explains, as we have explained, the nongeo­\ngraphical purposes of the words “lawfully made under this\ntitle.” Part II–B, supra. And it says nothing about geog­\nraphy. Nor, importantly, did §109(a)’s predecessor provi­\nsion. See supra, at 12. This means that, contrary to the\ndissent’s suggestion, any lack of legislative history per­\ntaining to the “first sale” doctrine only tends to bolster\nour position that Congress’ 1976 revision did not intend to\ncreate a drastic geographical change in its revision to that\nprovision. See post, at 18, n. 13. We consequently believe\nthat the legislative history, on balance, supports the non-\ngeographical interpretation.\n   Third, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeograph­\nical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impos­\nsible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide\nforeign and domestic markets. We concede that is so. A\npublisher may find it more difficult to charge different\nprices for the same book in different geographic markets.\nBut we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can\nfind no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that\npublishers are especially entitled to such rights.\n   The Constitution describes the nature of American\ncopyright law by providing Congress with the power to\n“secur[e]” to “[a]uthors” “for limited [t]imes” the “exclusive\n[r]ight to their . . . [w]ritings.” Art. I, §8, cl. 8. The Found­\ners, too, discussed the need to grant an author a limited\nright to exclude competition. Compare Letter from Thomas\nJefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 442–443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956)\n(arguing against any monopoly) with Letter from James\n32        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at\n16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) (arguing for a limited monopoly\nto secure production). But the Constitution’s language\nnowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should\ninclude a right to divide markets or a concomitant right\nto charge different purchasers different prices for the same\nbook, say to increase or to maximize gain. Neither, to our\nknowledge, did any Founder make any such suggestion.\nWe have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference\nfor interpretations of copyright statutes that would pro­\nvide for market divisions. Cf. Copyright Law Revision, pt.\n2, at 194 (statement of Barbara Ringer, Copyright Office)\n(division of territorial markets was “primarily a matter of\nprivate contract”).\n   To the contrary, Congress enacted a copyright law that\n(through the “first sale” doctrine) limits copyright holders’\nability to divide domestic markets. And that limitation is\nconsistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid mar­\nket divisions. Cf. Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46,\n49–50 (1990) (per curiam) (“[A]greements between compet­\nitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are\nillegal”). Whether copyright owners should, or should\nnot, have more than ordinary commercial power to divide\ninternational markets is a matter for Congress to decide.\nWe do no more here than try to determine what decision\nCongress has taken.\n   Fourth, the dissent and Wiley contend that our decision\nlaunches United States copyright law into an unprece­\ndented regime of “international exhaustion.” Post, at 18–\n23; Brief for Respondent 45–46. But they point to nothing\nindicative of congressional intent in 1976. The dissent\nalso claims that it is clear that the United States now\nopposes adopting such a regime, but the Solicitor General\nas amicus has taken no such position in this case. In fact,\nwhen pressed at oral argument, the Solicitor General\nstated that the consequences of Wiley’s reading of the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute (perpetual downstream control) were “worse” than\nthose of Kirtsaeng’s reading (restriction of market seg­\nmentation). Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. And the dissent’s reliance\non the Solicitor General’s position in Quality King is under-\nmined by his agreement in that case with our reading\nof §109(a). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 1470, p. 30 (“When . . . Con­\ngress wishes to make the location of manufacture relevant\nto Copyright Act protection, it does so expressly”); ibid.\n(calling it “distinctly unlikely” that Congress would have\nprovided an incentive for overseas manufacturing).\n  Moreover, the exhaustion regime the dissent apparently\nfavors would provide that “the sale in one country of a\ngood” does not “exhaus[t] the intellectual-property owner’s\nright to control the distribution of that good elsewhere.”\nPost, at 18–19. But our holding in Quality King that\n§109(a) is a defense in U. S. courts even when “the first\nsale occurred abroad,” 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14, has already\nsignificantly eroded such a principle.\n                             IV\n  For these reasons we conclude that the considerations\nsupporting Kirtsaeng’s nongeographical interpretation of\nthe words “lawfully made under this title” are the more\npersuasive. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Neither the text\nnor the history of 17 U. S. C. §109(a) supports removing\nfirst-sale protection from every copy of a protected work\nmanufactured abroad. See ante, at 8–16, 28–31. I recog-\nnize, however, that the combination of today’s decision\nand Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research\nInt’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135 (1998), constricts the scope of\n§602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation. I write to\nsuggest that any problems associated with that limitation\ncome not from our reading of §109(a) here, but from Qual-\nity King’s holding that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1).\n   As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played\nan integral part in American copyright law for over a\ncentury. See ante, at 17–19; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,\n210 U. S. 339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior\nto 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies\nmade in the United States. See ante, at 12. And nothing\nin the text or history of §109(a)—the Copyright Act of\n1976’s first-sale provision—suggests that Congress meant\nto enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley\nproposes, which at once would deprive American consum-\ners of important rights and encourage copyright holders to\nmanufacture abroad. See ante, at 8–16, 28–31.\n2           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n   That said, John Wiley is right that the Court’s decision,\nwhen combined with Quality King, substantially narrows\n§602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation. Quality\nKing held that the importation ban does not reach any\ncopies receiving first-sale protection under §109(a). See\n523 U. S., at 151–152. So notwithstanding §602(a)(1), an\n“owner of a particular copy . . . lawfully made under this\ntitle” can import that copy without the copyright owner’s\npermission. §109(a). In now holding that copies “lawfully\nmade under this title” include copies manufactured\nabroad, we unavoidably diminish §602(a)(1)’s scope—\nindeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See\nante, at 26–27.\n   But if Congress views the shrinking of §602(a)(1) as a\nproblem, it should recognize Quality King—not our deci-\nsion today—as the culprit. Here, after all, we merely\nconstrue §109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that\n§109(a) limits §602(a)(1). Had we come out the opposite\nway in that case, §602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner\nto restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the\nfirst-sale doctrine.1 That result would enable the copy-\nright owner to divide international markets in the way\nJohn Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting\n§602(a)(1). But it would do so without imposing down-\n——————\n  1 Although Quality King concluded that the statute’s text foreclosed\n\nthat outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151–152, the Solicitor General offered a\ncogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that §109(a) does not\nlimit §602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to “sell” or\n“dispose” of copies—not to import them: The Act’s first-sale provision\nand its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping\nspheres of conduct. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96–1470, pp. 5, 8–10. That reading\nremains the Government’s preferred way of construing the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 44 (“[W]e think that we still would adhere to our view\nthat section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section\n602(a)(1)”); see also ante, at 32–33; post, at 21, n. 15 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

In other words, that outcome would tar-\nget unauthorized importers alone, and not the “libraries,\nused-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods\nretailers, and museums” with whom the Court today is\nrightly concerned. Ante, at 19. Assuming Congress\nadopted §602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I sus-\npect that is how Congress thought the provision would\nwork—not by removing first-sale protection from every copy\nmanufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here),\nbut by enabling the copyright holder to control imports\neven when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King\nnow prevents).2\n  At bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks\nus to misconstrue §109(a) in order to restore §602(a)(1)\nto its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright\nholders to segment international markets. I think John\nWiley may have a point about what §602(a)(1) was de-\nsigned to do; that gives me pause about Quality King’s\nholding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation\nban’s scope. But the Court today correctly declines the\n——————\n  2 Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective\n\nof the first-sale doctrine—i.e., reversing Quality King—would yield a\nfar more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting\nJohn Wiley’s argument here. That is because only the former approach\nturns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their\nplace of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley\nprints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain\nversions only in Thailand. Without Quality King, John Wiley could do\nso—i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and pre-\nvent anyone from importing them back into the United States. But\nwith Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its\nreading of §109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-\nimporting the books—and so to segment the Thai market—John Wiley\nwould have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no reason\nwhy Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner’s power to\ndivide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.\n4         KIRTSAENG v.

That would swap\none (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make\nour reading of the statute only less reflective of Congres-\nsional intent. If Congress thinks copyright owners need\ngreater power to restrict importation and thus divide\nmarkets, a ready solution is at hand—not the one John\nWiley offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in\nQuality King.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The Court’s bold\ndeparture from Congress’ design is all the more stunning,\nfor it places the United States at the vanguard of the\nmovement for “international exhaustion” of copyrights—a\nmovement the United States has steadfastly resisted on\nthe world stage.\n  To justify a holding that shrinks to insignificance copy­\nright protection against the unauthorized importation of\nforeign-made copies, the Court identifies several “practical\nproblems.” Ante, at 24. The Court’s parade of horribles,\nhowever, is largely imaginary. Congress’ objective in\nenacting 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(1)’s importation prohibition\ncan be honored without generating the absurd conse­\nquences hypothesized in the Court’s opinion. I dissent\n2         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the Court’s embrace of “international exhaustion,”\nand would affirm the sound judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n   Because economic conditions and demand for particular\ngoods vary across the globe, copyright owners have a\nfinancial incentive to charge different prices for copies of\ntheir works in different geographic regions. Their ability\nto engage in such price discrimination, however, is under-\nmined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies\nfrom low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.\nThe question in this case is whether the unauthorized\nimportation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright\ninfringement under U. S. law.\n   To answer this question, one must examine three provi­\nsions of Title 17 of the U. S. Code: §§106(3), 109(a), and\n602(a)(1). Section 106 sets forth the “exclusive rights” of a\ncopyright owner, including the right “to distribute copies\nor phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by\nsale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or\nlending.” §106(3). This distribution right is limited by\n§109(a), which provides: “Notwithstanding the provisions\nof section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phono-\nrecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,\nwithout the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or\notherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or\nphonorecord.” Section 109(a) codifies the “first sale doc­\ntrine,” a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.\nStraus, 210 U. S. 339, 349–351 (1908), which held that a\ncopyright owner could not control the price at which re­\ntailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work. The\nfirst sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner\nshould not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over\nthe distribution of copies of a copyrighted work. At some\npoint—ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale—\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

It reads:\n        “Importation into the United States, without the\n     authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n     acquired outside the United States is an infringe-\n     ment of the exclusive right to distribute copies or\n     phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sec­\n     tion 501.”\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research\nInt’l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 143–154 (1998), the Court held\nthat a copyright owner’s right to control importation under\n§602(a)(1) is a component of the distribution right set forth\nin §106(3) and is therefore subject to §109(a)’s codification\nof the first sale doctrine. Quality King thus held that\nthe importation of copies made in the United States but\nsold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement\nunder §602(a)(1). Id., at 143–154. See also id., at 154\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (Quality King “involve[d] a\n‘round trip’ journey, travel of the copies in question from\nthe United States to places abroad, then back again”).2\n——————\n  1 In 2008, Congress renumbered what was previously §602(a) as\n\n§602(a)(1).

The Court’s\nobjective in this case should be to avoid unduly “constrict[ing] the scope\nof §602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized importation,” ante, at 1 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), while at the same time remaining faithful to Quality King’s\nholding and to the text and history of other Copyright Act provisions.\nThis aim is not difficult to achieve. See Parts II–V, infra. JUSTICE\nKAGAN and I appear to agree to this extent: Congress meant the ban on\nunauthorized importation to have real force. See ante, at 3 (acknowl­\nedging that “Wiley may have a point about what §602(a)(1) was de­\nsigned to do”).\n  3 See Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L’anza Research Int’l, Inc., 523\n\nU.

Petitioner Supap Kirtsaeng imported and then\nsold at a profit over 600 copies of copyrighted textbooks\nprinted outside the United States by the Asian subsidiary\nof respondent John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Wiley). App. 29–\n34. See also ante, at 3–5 (opinion of the Court). In the\nwords the Court used in Quality King, these copies “were\n‘lawfully made’ not under the United States Copyright\nAct, but instead, under the law of some other country.”\n523 U. S., at 147. Section 109(a) therefore does not ap-\nply, and Kirtsaeng’s unauthorized importation constitutes\ncopyright infringement under §602(a)(1).\n   The Court does not deny that under the language I have\nquoted from Quality King, Wiley would prevail. Ante, at\n27. Nevertheless, the Court dismisses this language, to\nwhich all Members of the Quality King Court subscribed,\nas ill-considered dictum. Ante, at 27–28. I agree that the\ndiscussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essen­\ntial to the Court’s judgment. See Quality King, 523 U. S.,\nat 154 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (“[W]e do not today\nresolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports\nwere manufactured abroad.”). But I disagree with the\nCourt’s conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.\nInstead, for the reasons explained below, I would hold,\nconsistently with Quality King’s dictum, that §602(a)(1)\nauthorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a\ncopy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.\n                            II\n  The text of the Copyright Act demonstrates that Con­\ngress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent\n6         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nremedy against the importation of foreign-made copies of\ntheir copyrighted works. As the Court recognizes, ante, at\n3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase “lawfully\nmade under this title” in §109(a). In my view, that phrase\nis most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a\ncopy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compli­\nance with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. This reading is\nconsistent with the Court’s interpretation of similar lan­\nguage in other statutes. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v.\nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 52–53 (2008)\n(“under” in 11 U. S. C. §1146(a), a Bankruptcy Code provi­\nsion exempting certain asset transfers from stamp taxes,\nmeans “pursuant to”); Ardestani v. INS, 502 U. S. 129, 135\n(1991) (the phrase “under section 554” in the Equal Access\nto Justice Act means “subject to” or “governed by” 5\nU. S. C. §554 (internal quotation marks omitted)). It also\naccords with dictionary definitions of the word “under.”\nSee, e.g., American Heritage Dictionary 1887 (5th ed.\n2011) (“under” means, among other things, “[s]ubject to\nthe authority, rule, or control of ”).\n   Section 109(a), properly read, affords Kirtsaeng no\ndefense against Wiley’s claim of copyright infringement.\nThe Copyright Act, it has been observed time and again,\ndoes not apply extraterritorially. See United Dictionary\nCo. v. G. & C. Merriam Co., 208 U. S. 260, 264 (1908)\n(copyright statute requiring that U. S. copyright notices be\nplaced in all copies of a work did not apply to copies pub­\nlished abroad because U. S. copyright laws have no “force”\nbeyond the United States’ borders); 4 M. Nimmer & D.\nNimmer, Copyright §17.02, p. 17–18 (2012) (hereinafter\nNimmer) (“[C]opyright laws do not have any extraterrito­\nrial operation.”); 4 W. Patry, Copyright §13:22, p. 13–66\n(2012) (hereinafter Patry) (“Copyright laws are rigor-\nously territorial.”).    The printing of Wiley’s foreign­\nmanufactured textbooks therefore was not governed by\nTitle 17. The textbooks thus were not “lawfully made\n                      Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      7\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nunder [Title 17],” the crucial precondition for application\nof §109(a). And if §109(a) does not apply, there is no dis­\npute that Kirtsaeng’s conduct constituted copyright in­\nfringement under §602(a)(1).\n   The Court’s point of departure is similar to mine. Ac­\ncording to the Court, the phrase “ ‘lawfully made under\nthis title’ means made ‘in accordance with’ or ‘in compli­\nance with’ the Copyright Act.” Ante, at 8. But the Court\noverlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites,\nante, at 9, the word “under” commonly signals a relation­\nship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regu-\nlated by another. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed.\n1990) (“under” “frequently” means “inferior” or “subordi­\nnate” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (“under” means,\namong other things, “[i]n accordance with (some regulative\npower or principle)” (emphasis added)). See also Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (“under”\nmeans, among other things, “in . . . a condition of sub-\njection, regulation, or subordination” and “suffering re­\nstriction, restraint, or control by”). Only by disregarding\nthis established meaning of “under” can the Court arrive\nat the conclusion that Wiley’s foreign-manufactured text­\nbooks were “lawfully made under” U. S. copyright law,\neven though that law did not govern their creation. It is\nanomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as\n“lawful” under an inapplicable law. For example, one\nmight say that driving on the right side of the road in\nEngland is “lawful” under U. S. law, but that would be so\nonly because U. S. law has nothing to say about the sub­\nject. The governing law is English law, and English law\ndemands that driving be done on the left side of the road.4\n——————\n  4 The Court asserts that my position gives the word “lawfully” in\n\n§109(a) “little, if any, linguistic work to do.” Ante, at 9. That is not so.\nMy reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase “lawfully made\n8            KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The logical implication of the Court’s definition of the\nword “under” is that any copy manufactured abroad—even\na piratical one made without the copyright owner’s author­\nization and in violation of the law of the country where it\nwas created—would fall within the scope of §109(a). Any\nsuch copy would have been made “in accordance with” or\n“in compliance with” the U. S. Copyright Act, in the sense\nthat manufacturing the copy did not violate the Act (be­\ncause the Act does not apply extraterritorially).\n  The Court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd\nconclusion. Instead, it interprets §109(a) as applying only\nto copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or\nwould have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been ap­\nplicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United\nStates). See ante, at 8 (“§109(a)’s ‘first sale’ doctrine would\napply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture\nmet the requirements of American copyright law.”). Con­\ngress, however, used express language when it called for\nsuch a counterfactual inquiry in 17 U. S. C. §§602(a)(2)\nand (b). See §602(a)(2) (“Importation into the United\nStates or exportation from the United States, without the\nauthority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\ncopies or phonorecords, the making of which either consti­\ntuted an infringement of copyright, or which would have\nconstituted an infringement of copyright if this title had\nbeen applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right\nto distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106.”\n(emphasis added)); §602(b) (“In a case where the making\n——————\nunder this title.” The word “made” signifies that the conduct at issue is\nthe creation or manufacture of a copy. See Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1356 (1961) (defining “made” as “artificially\nproduced by a manufacturing process”). The word “lawfully” indicates\nthat for §109(a) to apply, the copy’s creation must have complied with\nsome body of law. Finally, the prepositional phrase “under this title”\nclarifies what that body of law is—namely, the copyright prescriptions\ncontained in Title 17 of the U. S. Code.\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof the copies or phonorecords would have constituted an\ninfringement of copyright if this title had been applicable,\ntheir importation is prohibited.” (emphasis added)). Had\nCongress intended courts to engage in a similarly hypo­\nthetical inquiry under §109(a), Congress would pre-\nsumably have included similar language in that section.\nSee Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(“ ‘[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.’ ” (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,\n472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam); brackets in\noriginal)).5\n——————\n  5 Attempting  to show that my reading of §109(a) is susceptible to the\nsame criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed “manufacturing\nclause,” which required “copies of a work consisting preponderantly of\nnondramatic literary material . . . in the English language” to be\n“manufactured in the United States or Canada.” Copyright Act of 1976,\n§601(a), 90 Stat. 2588. Because Congress expressly referred to manu­\nfacturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase “lawfully\nmade under this title” in §109(a) cannot mean “manufactured in the\nUnited States.” Ante, at 19. This argument is a non sequitur. I do not\ncontend that the phrases “lawfully made under this title” and “manu­\nfactured in the United States” are interchangeable. To repeat, I read\nthe phrase “lawfully made under this title” as referring to instances in\nwhich a copy’s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance\nwith, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. See supra, at 6. Not all copies “manu­\nfactured in the United States” will satisfy this standard. For example,\npiratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copy­\nright owner’s authorization are not “lawfully made under [Title 17].”\nNor would the phrase “lawfully manufactured in the United States” be\nan exact substitute for “lawfully made under this title.” The making of\na copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provi­\nsion of law. Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright\nowner’s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum\nwage. The copy would be “lawfully made under [Title 17]” in the sense\nthat its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the\ncopy’s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the viola­\n10           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Not only does the Court adopt an unnatural construc­\ntion of the §109(a) phrase “lawfully made under this title.”\nConcomitantly, the Court reduces §602(a)(1) to insignifi­\ncance. As the Court appears to acknowledge, see ante, at\n26, the only independent effect §602(a)(1) has under to­\nday’s decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations\ncarried out by persons who merely have possession of, but\ndo not own, the imported copies. See 17 U. S. C. §109(a)\n(§109(a) applies to any “owner of a particular copy or\nphonorecord lawfully made under this title” (emphasis\nadded)).6 If this is enough to avoid rendering §602(a)(1)\nentirely “superfluous,” ante, at 26, it hardly suffices to give\nthe owner’s importation right the scope Congress intended\nit to have. Congress used broad language in §602(a)(1); it\ndid so to achieve a broad objective. Had Congress intended\nsimply to provide a copyright remedy against larcenous\nlessees, licensees, consignees, and bailees of films and\nother copyright-protected goods, see ante, at 13–14, 26, it\nlikely would have used language tailored to that narrow\npurpose. See 2 Nimmer §8.12[B][6][c], at 8–184.31, n. 432\n(“It may be wondered whether . . . potential causes of\naction [against licensees and the like] are more than theo­\nretical.”). See also ante, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concurring) (the\nCourt’s decision limits §602(a)(1) “to a fairly esoteric set of\n——————\ntion of the minimum-wage laws.\n   6 When §602(a)(1) was originally enacted in 1976, it played an addi­\n\ntional role—providing a private cause of action against importers of\npiratical goods. See Quality King, 523 U. S., at 146. In 2008, however,\nCongress amended §602 to provide for such a cause of action in\n§602(a)(2), which prohibits the unauthorized “[i]mportation into the\nUnited States . . . of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have consti­\ntuted an infringement of copyright if [Title 17] had been applicable.”\nSee PROIPA, §105(b)(3), 122 Stat. 4259–4260. Thus, under the Court’s\ninterpretation, the only conduct reached by §602(a)(1) but not\n§602(a)(2) is a nonowner’s unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical\ncopy.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

C.\n§602(a)(3)’s exceptions to §602(a)(1)’s importation prohibi­\ntion. 2 P. Goldstein, Copyright §7.6.1.2(a), p. 7:141 (3d ed.\n2012) (hereinafter Goldstein).8 Those exceptions permit\nthe importation of copies without the copyright owner’s\nauthorization for certain governmental, personal, schol-\narly, educational, and religious purposes. 17 U. S. C.\n§602(a)(3). Copies imported under these exceptions “will\noften be lawfully made gray market goods purchased\nthrough normal market channels abroad.” 2 Goldstein\n——————\n   7 Notably, the Court ignores the history of §602(a)(1), which reveals\n\nthat the primary purpose of the prescription was not to provide a\nremedy against rogue licensees, consignees, and bailees, against whom\ncopyright owners could frequently assert breach-of-contract claims even\nin the absence of §602(a)(1). Instead, the primary purpose of §602(a)(1)\nwas to reach third-party importers, enterprising actors like Kirtsaeng,\nagainst whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to\nlack of privity. See Part III, infra.\n   8 Section 602(a)(3) provides:\n\n“This subsection [i.e., §602(a)] does not apply to—\n   “(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the\nauthority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of\nany State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or\nphonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work\nimported for purposes other than archival use;\n   “(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or\nexporter and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more\nthan one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by\nany person arriving from outside the United States or departing from\nthe United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part\nof such person’s personal baggage; or\n   “(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly,\neducational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect\nto no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival\npurposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other\nwork for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation\nof such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of sys­\ntematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization\nin violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2).”\n12           KIRTSAENG v.

For example,\nhad Congress conceived of §109(a)’s sweep as the Court\ndoes, what earthly reason would there be to provide, as\nCongress did in §602(a)(3)(C), that a library may import\n“no more than five copies” of a non-audiovisual work for its\n“lending or archival purposes”?\n   The far more plausible reading of §§109(a) and 602(a),\nthen, is that Congress intended §109(a) to apply to copies\nmade in the United States, not to copies manufactured\nand sold abroad. That reading of the first sale and impor­\ntation provisions leaves §602(a)(3)’s exceptions with real,\nmeaningful work to do. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (“It is a cardinal principle of statutory\nconstruction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sen­\ntence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the range of circum-\nstances covered by the exceptions, §602(a)(3) frees indi­\nviduals and entities who purchase foreign-made copies\nabroad from the requirement they would otherwise face\nunder §602(a)(1) of obtaining the copyright owner’s per­\nmission to import the copies into the United States.10\n——————\n  9 The term “gray market good” refers to a good that is “imported out­\n\nside the distribution channels that have been contractually negotiated\nby the intellectual property owner.” Forsyth & Rothnie, Parallel\nImports, in The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and\nCompetition Policy 429 (S. Anderman ed. 2007). Such goods are also\ncommonly called “parallel imports.” Ibid.\n  10 The Court asserts that its reading of §109(a) is bolstered by §104,\n\nwhich extends the copyright “protection[s]” of Title 17 to a wide variety\nof foreign works. See ante, at 10–11. The “protection under this title”\nafforded by §104, however, is merely protection against infringing\nconduct within the United States, the only place where Title 17 applies.\nSee 4 W. Patry, Copyright §13:44.10, pp. 13–128 to 13–129 (2012)\n(hereinafter Patry). Thus, my reading of the phrase “under this title” in\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Section\n602(a)(1) was enacted as part of the Copyright Act of 1976,\n90 Stat. 2589–2590. That Act was the product of a lengthy\nrevision effort overseen by the U. S. Copyright Office. See\nMills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U. S. 153, 159–160 (1985).\nIn its initial 1961 report on recommended revisions, the\nCopyright Office noted that publishers had “suggested\nthat the [then-existing] import ban on piratical copies\nshould be extended to bar the importation of . . . foreign\nedition[s]” in violation of “agreements to divide interna­\ntional markets for copyrighted works.” Copyright Law\nRevision: Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 126 (H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1961) (herein­\nafter Copyright Law Revision). See Copyright Act of 1947,\n§106, 61 Stat. 663 (“The importation into the United\nStates . . . of any piratical copies of any work copyrighted\n——————\n§109(a) is consistent with Congress’ use of that phrase in §104. Fur­\nthermore, §104 describes which works are entitled to copyright protec­\ntion under U. S. law. But no one disputes that Wiley’s copyrights in the\nworks at issue in this case are valid. The only question is whether\nKirtsaeng’s importation of copies of those works infringed Wiley’s\ncopyrights. It is basic to copyright law that “[o]wnership of a copyright\n. . . is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work\nis embodied.” 17 U. S. C. §202. See also §101 (“ ‘Copies’ are material\nobjects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any\nmethod now known or later developed, and from which the work can be\nperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or\nwith the aid of a machine or device.”). Given the distinction copyright\nlaw draws between works and copies, §104 is inapposite to the question\nhere presented. 4 Patry §13:44.10, at 13–129 (“There is no connection,\nlinguistically or substantively, between Section[s] 104 and 109: Section\n104 deals with national eligibility for the intangible work of authorship;\nSection 109(a) deals with the tangible, physical embodiment of the\nwork, the ‘copy.’ ”).\n14         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nin the United States . . . is prohibited.”). The Copyright\nOffice originally recommended against such an extension\nof the importation ban, reasoning that enforcement of\nterritorial restrictions was best left to contract law. Copy­\nright Law Revision 126.\n   Publishing-industry representatives argued strenuously\nagainst the position initially taken by the Copyright Of­\nfice. At a 1962 panel discussion on the Copyright Office’s\nreport, for example, Horace Manges of the American Book\nPublishers Council stated:\n     “When a U. S. book publisher enters into a contract\n     with a British publisher to acquire exclusive U. S.\n     rights for a particular book, he often finds that the\n     English edition . . . of that particular book finds its\n     way into this country. Now it’s all right to say, ‘Com­\n     mence a lawsuit for breach of contract.’ But this is\n     expensive, burdensome, and, for the most part, inef­\n     fective.” Copyright Law Revision Part 2: Discussion\n     and Comments on Report of the Register of Copy­\n     rights on the General Revision of the U.

Print 1963).\n   Sidney Diamond, representing London Records, elabo­\nrated on Manges’ statement. “There are many situations,”\nhe explained, “in which it is not necessarily a question of\nthe inadequacy of a contract remedy—in the sense that it\nmay be difficult or not quick enough to solve the particular\nproblem.” Id., at 213. “Very frequently,” Diamond stated,\npublishers “run into a situation where . . . copies of [a]\nwork . . . produced in a foreign country . . . may be shipped\n[to the United States] without violating any contract of the\nU. S. copyright proprietor.” Ibid. To illustrate, Diamond\nnoted, if a “British publisher [sells a copy] to an individual\nwho in turn ship[s] it over” to the United States, the indi­\nvidual’s conduct would not “violate [any] contract between\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In such a\ncase, “no possibility of any contract remedy” would exist.\nIbid. The facts of Kirtsaeng’s case fit Diamond’s example,\nsave that the copies at issue here were printed and ini-\ntially sold in Asia rather than Great Britain.\n   After considering comments on its 1961 report, the\nCopyright Office “prepared a preliminary draft of provi­\nsions for a new copyright statute.” Copyright Law Revi­\nsion Part 3: Preliminary Draft for Revised U.

In particu­\nlar, §44(a) provided:\n    “Importation into the United States of copies or rec­\n    ords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the\n    public shall, if such articles are imported without the\n    authority of the owner of the exclusive right to dis­\n    tribute copies or records under this title, constitute an\n    infringement of copyright actionable under section 35\n    [i.e., the section providing for a private cause of action\n    for copyright infringement].” Id., at 32–33.\n   In a 1964 panel discussion regarding the draft statute,\nAbe Goldman, the Copyright Office’s General Counsel, left\nno doubt about the meaning of §44(a). It represented, he\nexplained, a “shif[t]” from the Copyright Office’s 1961\nreport, which had recommended against using copyright\nlaw to facilitate publishers’ efforts to segment interna­\ntional markets. Copyright Law Revision Part 4: Further\nDiscussions and Comments on Preliminary Draft for\nRevised U. S. Copyright Law, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 203\n(H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1964). Section 44(a), Gold­\nman stated, would allow copyright owners to bring in­\nfringement actions against importers of “foreign copies\nthat were made under proper authority.” Ibid.

S. copyright law by ex­\ntending import prohibitions “to works legally produced in\nEurope” and other foreign countries).11\n  The next step in the copyright revision process was the\nintroduction in Congress of a draft bill on July 20, 1964.\nSee Copyright Law Revision Part 5: 1964 Revision Bill\nwith Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., III\n(H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1965). After another round\nof public comments, a revised bill was introduced on Feb­\nruary 4, 1965. See Copyright Law Revision Part 6: Sup­\nplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law: 1965 Revi­\nsion Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., V (H. R. Judiciary Comm.\nPrint 1965) (hereinafter Copyright Law Revision Part 6).\nIn language closely resembling the statutory text later\nenacted by Congress, §602(a) of the 1965 bill provided:\n     “Importation into the United States, without the au­\n     thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work for the purpose of\n     distribution to the public is an infringement of the ex­\n     clusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords un­\n     der section 106, actionable under section 501.” Id., at\n     292.12\n\n——————\n  11 As the Court observes, ante, at 29, Irwin Karp of the Authors\n\nLeague of America stated at the 1964 panel discussion that §44(a) ran\ncounter to “the very basic concept of copyright law that, once you’ve sold\na copy legally, you can’t restrict its resale.” Copyright Law Revision\nPart 4, at 212. When asked if he was “presenting . . . an argument\nagainst” §44(a), however, Karp responded that he was “neutral on th[e]\nprovision.” Id., at 211. There is thus little reason to believe that any\nchanges to the wording of §44(a) before its codification in §602(a) were\nmade in response to Karp’s discussion of “the problem of restricting\n[the] transfer of . . . lawfully obtained [foreign] copies.” Ibid.\n  12 There is but one difference between this language from the 1965\n\nbill and the corresponding language in the current version of §602(a)(1):\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 29. The\nCopyright Office, however, did not see it that way. In its\nsummary of the 1965 bill’s provisions, the Copyright Office\nobserved that §602(a) of the 1965 bill, like §44(a) of the\nCopyright Office’s prior draft, see supra, at 15–16, permit­\nted copyright owners to bring infringement actions against\nunauthorized importers in cases “where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of [the imported] copies\nin a foreign country for distribution only in that country.”\nCopyright Law Revision Part 6, at 149–150. See also id.,\nat XXVI (Under §602(a) of the 1965 bill, “[a]n unauthorized\nimporter could be enjoined and sued for damages both\nwhere the copies or phonorecords he was importing\nwere ‘piratical’ (that is, where their making would have\nconstituted an infringement if the U. S. copyright law\ncould have been applied), and where their making was\n‘lawful.’ ”).\n   The current text of §602(a)(1) was finally enacted into\nlaw in 1976. See Copyright Act of 1976, §602(a), 90 Stat.\n2589–2590. The House and Senate Committee Reports on\nthe 1976 Act demonstrate that Congress understood, as\ndid the Copyright Office, just what that text meant.

The\n     general approach of section 602 is to make unauthor-\n     ized importation an act of infringement in both cases,\n     but to permit the Bureau of Customs to prohibit im­\n     portation only of ‘piratical’ articles.” S.

To the con-\ntrary, it confirms what the plain text of the Act conveys:\nCongress intended §602(a)(1) to provide copyright owners\nwith a remedy against the unauthorized importation of\nforeign-made copies of their works, even if those copies\nwere made and sold abroad with the copyright owner’s\nauthorization.13\n                             IV\n  Unlike the Court’s holding, my position is consistent with\nthe stance the United States has taken in international­\ntrade negotiations. This case bears on the highly con­\ntentious trade issue of interterritorial exhaustion. The\nissue arises because intellectual property law is territorial\nin nature, see supra, at 6, which means that creators of\nintellectual property “may hold a set of parallel” intellec­\ntual property rights under the laws of different nations.\nChiappetta, The Desirability of Agreeing to Disagree: The\nWTO, TRIPS, International IPR Exhaustion and a Few\nOther Things, 21 Mich.

See\nForsyth & Rothnie, Parallel Imports, in The Interface\nBetween Intellectual Property Rights and Competition\nPolicy 429, 430 (S. Anderman ed. 2007) (hereinafter\nForsyth & Rothnie). Another option is a rule of international\nexhaustion, under which the authorized distribution of a\nparticular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copy­\nright owner’s distribution right everywhere with respect\nto that copy. See ibid. The European Union has adopted\nthe intermediate approach of regional exhaustion, under\nwhich the sale of a copy anywhere within the European\nEconomic Area exhausts the copyright owner’s distribu­\ntion right throughout that region. See id., at 430, 445.\nSection 602(a)(1), in my view, ties the United States to a\nnational-exhaustion framework. The Court’s decision, in con-\ntrast, places the United States solidly in the international­\nexhaustion camp.\n   Strong arguments have been made both in favor of, and\nin opposition to, international exhaustion. See Chiappetta\n360 (“[r]easonable people making valid points can, and\ndo, reach conflicting conclusions” regarding the desirability\nof international exhaustion). International exhaustion\nsubjects copyright-protected goods to competition from\nlower priced imports and, to that extent, benefits con-\nsumers. Correspondingly, copyright owners profit from a\nnational-exhaustion regime, which also enlarges the mon­\netary incentive to create new copyrightable works. See\nForsyth & Rothnie 432–437 (surveying arguments for and\nagainst international exhaustion).\n   Weighing the competing policy concerns, our Govern­\nment reached the conclusion that widespread adoption of\nthe international-exhaustion framework would be incon­\nsistent with the long-term economic interests of the United\nStates.

Quality King, I acknowledge, discounted\nthe Government’s concerns about potential inconsistency\nwith United States obligations under certain bilateral\ntrade agreements. See 523 U. S., at 153–154. See also\nQuality King Brief 22–24 (listing the agreements). That\ndecision, however, dealt only with copyright-protected\nproducts made in the United States. See 523 U.

S. copyrights could retain\ncontrol over the importation of copies manufactured and\nsold abroad—a point the Court obscures, see ante, at 33\n(arguing that Quality King “significantly eroded” the\nnational-exhaustion principle that, in my view, §602(a)(1)\nembraces). The Court today answers that question with a\nresounding “no,” and in doing so, it risks undermining the\nUnited States’ credibility on the world stage. While the\nGovernment has urged our trading partners to refrain\nfrom adopting international-exhaustion regimes that could\nbenefit consumers within their borders but would impact\nadversely on intellectual-property producers in the United\nStates, the Court embraces an international-exhaustion\nrule that could benefit U.

At that time, no statutory provision\nexpressly codified the first sale doctrine. Instead, copy­\nright law merely provided that copyright owners had “the\nsole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing,\ncopying, executing, finishing, and vending” their works.\nCopyright Act of 1891, §1, 26 Stat. 1107.\n   In Bobbs-Merrill, the Court addressed the scope of the\nstatutory right to “ven[d].” In granting that right, the\nCourt held, Congress did not intend to permit copyright\nowners “to fasten . . . a restriction upon the subsequent\nalienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the\nowner had parted with the title to one who had acquired\nfull dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for\nit.” 210 U. S., at 349–350. “[O]ne who has sold a copy­\nrighted article . . . without restriction,” the Court ex­\nplained, “has parted with all right to control the sale of it.”\nId., at 350. Thus, “[t]he purchaser of a book, once sold by\nauthority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again,\nalthough he could not publish a new edition of it.” Ibid.\n   Under the logic of Bobbs-Merrill, the sale of a foreign­\nmanufactured copy in the United States carried out with\nthe copyright owner’s authorization would exhaust the\ncopyright owner’s right to “vend” that copy. The copy\ncould thenceforth be resold, lent out, or otherwise redis­\ntributed without further authorization from the copyright\nowner. Although §106(3) uses the word “distribute” rather\nthan “vend,” there is no reason to think Congress intended\nthe word “distribute” to bear a meaning different from the\nconstruction the Court gave to the word “vend” in Bobbs-\nMerrill. See ibid. (emphasizing that the question before\nthe Court was “purely [one] of statutory construction”).19\n——————\n  19 It appears that the Copyright Act of 1976 omitted the word “vend”\n\nand introduced the word “distribute” to avoid the “redundan[cy]”\npresent in pre-1976 law.

After such an authorized distribution, a library\nmay lend, or a used-book dealer may resell, the foreign­\nmade copy without seeking the copyright owner’s permis­\nsion. Cf. ante, at 19–21.\n   For example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had\nimported into the United States and then sold the foreign­\nmade textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley’s §106(3) dis­\ntribution right would have been exhausted under the\nrationale of Bobbs-Merrill. Purchasers of the textbooks\nwould thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished\nwithout first gaining a license from Wiley.\n   This line of reasoning, it must be acknowledged, signifi­\ncantly curtails the independent effect of §109(a). If, as I\nmaintain, the term “distribute” in §106(3) incorporates the\nfirst sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then\n§109(a)’s codification of that doctrine adds little to the\nregulatory regime.20 Section 109(a), however, does serve\n——————\nthat the exclusive rights to “publish” and “vend” works under the\nCopyright Act of 1947, §1(a), 61 Stat. 652–653, were “redundant”).\n  20 My position that Bobbs-Merrill lives on as a limiting construction of\n\nthe §106(3) distribution right does not leave §109(a) with no work to do.\nThere can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were\npublished and first sold in the United States.

Congress first codified the first\nsale doctrine in §41 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat.\n1084.21 It did so, the House Committee Report on the\n1909 Act explains, “in order to make . . . clear that [Con­\ngress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the\nconstruction to be given to the word ‘vend.’ ” H. R. Rep.\nNo. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909). According to the\nCommittee Report, §41 was “not intended to change [exist­\ning law] in any way.” Ibid. The position I have stated and\nexplained accords with this expression of congressional\nintent. In enacting §41 and its successors, I would hold,\nCongress did not “change . . . existing law,” ibid., by strip­\nping the word “vend” (and thus its substitute “distribute”)\nof the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.\n   In any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which\nI subscribe honors Congress’ aim in enacting §109(a)\nwhile the Court’s reading of the Act severely diminishes\n§602(a)(1)’s role. See supra, at 10–12. My position in no\nway tugs against the principle underlying §109(a)—i.e.,\nthat certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the\n——————\nStates with the copyright owner’s permission, not when it is distributed\nabroad. But under §109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any author­\nized distribution of a U. S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in\na foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner’s distribution right\nunder §106(3). See 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14. Section 109(a) therefore\nprovides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.\n   21 Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: “[N]othing in this Act shall be\n\ndeemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a\ncopyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.”\n35 Stat. 1084. This language was repeated without material change in\n§27 of the Copyright Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 660. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 2, 17 U. S. C. §109(a) sets out the current codification of the\nfirst sale doctrine.\n28           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nowner’s §106(3) distribution right. The Court, in contrast,\nfails to give meaningful effect to Congress’ manifest intent\nin §602(a)(1) to grant copyright owners the right to control\nthe importation of foreign-made copies of their works.\n                             2\n   Other statutory prescriptions provide further protection\nagainst the absurd consequences imagined by the Court.\nFor example, §602(a)(3)(C) permits “an organization oper­\nated for scholarly, educational, or religious purposes” to\nimport, without the copyright owner’s authorization, up to\nfive foreign-made copies of a non-audiovisual work—\nnotably, a book—for “library lending or archival purposes.”\nBut cf. ante, at 19–20 (suggesting that affirming the Se­\ncond Circuit’s decision might prevent libraries from lend­\ning foreign-made books).22\n   The Court also notes that amici representing art muse­\nums fear that a ruling in Wiley’s favor would prevent\nmuseums from displaying works of art created abroad.\nAnte, at 22 (citing Brief for Association of Art Museum\nDirectors et al.). These amici observe that a museum’s\nright to display works of art often depends on 17 U. S. C.\n§109(c).

The United States maintains, and I agree, however, that\n§602(a)(3)(C) “is fairly (and best) read as implicitly authorizing lending,\nin addition to importation, of all works other than audiovisual works.”\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 6.\n  23 Title 17 U.

Because §109(c), like\n§109(a), applies only to copies “lawfully made under this\ntitle,” amici contend that a ruling in Wiley’s favor would\nprevent museums from invoking §109(c) with respect to\nforeign-made works of art. Id., at 11–13.24\n   Limiting §109(c) to U. S.-made works, however, does not\nbar art museums from lawfully displaying works made in\nother countries. Museums can, of course, seek the copy­\nright owner’s permission to display a work. Furthermore,\nthe sale of a work of art to a U. S. museum may carry with\nit an implied license to publicly display the work. See 2\nPatry §5:131, at 5–280 (“[C]ourts have noted the potential\navailability of an implied nonexclusive licens[e] when the\ncircumstances . . . demonstrate that the parties intended\nthat the work would be used for a specific purpose.”).\nDisplaying a work of art as part of a museum exhibition\nmight also qualify as a “fair use” under 17 U. S. C. §107.\nCf. Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens Ltd. Partnership, 619\nF. 3d 301, 313–316 (CA4 2010) (display of copyrighted logo\nin museum-like exhibition constituted “fair use”).\n   The Court worries about the resale of foreign-made\nconsumer goods “contain[ing] copyrightable software pro­\ngrams or packaging.” Ante, at 21. For example, the Court\nobserves that a car might be programmed with diverse\nforms of software, the copyrights to which might be\nowned by individuals or entities other than the manu-\nfacturer of the car. Ibid. Must a car owner, the Court\nasks, obtain permission from all of these various copyright\nowners before reselling her car? Ibid.

Three decades have passed since a\nfederal court first published an opinion reading §109(a) as\napplicable exclusively to copies made in the United States.\nSee Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Scorpio Music\nDistributors, Inc., 569 F. Supp. 47, 49 (ED Pa. 1983),\nsummarily aff ’d, 738 F. 2d 424 (CA3 1984) (table). Yet\nKirtsaeng and his supporting amici cite not a single case\nin which the owner of a consumer good authorized for sale\nin the United States has been sued for copyright infringe­\nment after reselling the item or giving it away as a gift or\nto charity. The absence of such lawsuits is unsurprising.\nRoutinely suing one’s customers is hardly a best business\n\n——————\n  25 Principlesof fair use and implied license may also allow a U. S.\ntourist “who buys a copyrighted work of art, a poster, or . . . a bumper\nsticker” abroad to publicly “display it in America without the copyright\nowner’s further authorization.” Ante, at 15. (The tourist could lawfully\nbring the work of art, poster, or bumper sticker into the United States\nunder 17 U. S. C. §602(a)(3)(B), which provides that §602(a)(1)’s impor­\ntation ban does not apply to “importation . . . by any person arriving\nfrom outside the United States . . . with respect to copies . . . forming\npart of such person’s personal baggage.”). Furthermore, an individual\nclearly would not incur liability for infringement merely by displaying a\nforeign-made poster or other artwork in her home. See §106(5) (grant­\ning the owners of copyrights in “literary, musical, dramatic, and chore­\nographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural\nworks” the exclusive right “to display the copyrighted work publicly”\n(emphasis added)).

Manufacturers may also insist that soft-\nware programmers agree to contract terms barring such\nlawsuits.\n  The Court provides a different explanation for the\nabsence of the untoward consequences predicted in its\nopinion—namely, that lower court decisions regarding the\nscope of §109(a)’s first sale prescription have not been\nuniform. Ante, at 23. Uncertainty generated by these\nconflicting decisions, the Court notes, may have deterred\nsome copyright owners from pressing infringement claims.\nAnte, at 23–24. But if, as the Court suggests, there are a\nmultitude of copyright owners champing at the bit to bring\nlawsuits against libraries, art museums, and consumers in\nan effort to exercise perpetual control over the down­\nstream distribution and public display of foreign-made\ncopies, might one not expect that at least a handful of such\nlawsuits would have been filed over the past 30 years?\nThe absence of such suits indicates that the “practical\nproblems” hypothesized by the Court are greatly exagger­\nated.

A8\n(“Cadillac plays up its warranty coverage and reliable resale value to\nprospective customers.”). If the transaction costs of reselling vehicles\nwere to rise, consumers’ perception of a new car’s value, and thus the\nprice they are willing to pay for such a car, might fall—an outcome\nhardly favorable to automobile manufacturers.\n  27 It should not be overlooked that the ability to prevent importation\n\nof foreign-made copies encourages copyright owners such as Wiley to\noffer copies of their works at reduced prices to consumers in less devel­\noped countries who might otherwise be unable to afford them. The\nCourt’s holding, however, prevents copyright owners from barring the\nimportation of such low-priced copies into the United States, where\nthey will compete with the higher priced editions copyright owners\n32          KIRTSAENG v.

Second, as\ncodification of the first sale doctrine underscores, Congress\ndid not want the exclusive distribution right conferred in\n§106(3) to be boundless.
