JOHN WILEY\n                 & SONS, INC.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11\u2013697.      Argued October 29, 2012\u2014Decided March 19, 2013\nThe \u201cexclusive rights\u201d that a copyright owner has \u201cto distribute copies\n  . . . of [a] copyrighted work,\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7106(3), are qualified by the\n  application of several limitations set out in \u00a7\u00a7107 through 122, in-\n  cluding the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine, which provides that \u201cthe owner of a\n  particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is\n  entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or oth-\n  erwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord,\u201d \u00a7109(a).\n  Importing a copy made abroad without the copyright owner\u2019s permis-\n  sion is an infringement of \u00a7106(3). See \u00a7602(a)(1). In Quality King\n  Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research Int\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145,\n  this Court held that \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s reference to \u00a7106(3) incorporates the\n  \u00a7\u00a7107 through 122 limitations, including \u00a7109\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine.\n  However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the\n  United States and then sent abroad and sold.\n      Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., an academic textbook pub-\n  lisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley\n  Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wiley\u2019s Eng-\n  lish language textbooks abroad. Wiley Asia\u2019s books state that they\n  are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.\n  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States\n  to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edi-\n  tion English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold\n  at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States. He then\n  sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the\n  profit.\n      Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng\u2019s unauthorized importa-\n  tion and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley\u2019s \u00a7106(3)\n2             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    exclusive right to distribute and \u00a7602\u2019s import prohibition. Kirtsaeng\n    replied that because his books were \u201clawfully made\u201d and acquired le-\n    gitimately, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine permitted importation and\n    resale without Wiley\u2019s further permission. The District Court held\n    that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine\n    does not apply to goods manufactured abroad. The jury then found\n    that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley\u2019s American copyrights\n    and assessed damages. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n    \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d language indicated that the\n    \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted\n    works manufactured abroad.\nHeld: The \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work\n lawfully made abroad. Pp. 7\u201333.\n    (a) Wiley reads \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d to impose a geo-\n graphical limitation that prevents \u00a7109(a)\u2019s doctrine from applying to\n Wiley Asia\u2019s books. Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as impos-\n ing the non-geographical limitation made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or \u201cin\n compliance with\u201d the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine\n to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner\u2019s\n permission. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Section 109(a)\u2019s language, its context, and the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doc-\n trine\u2019s common-law history favor Kirtsaeng\u2019s reading. Pp. 8\u201324.\n      (1) Section 109(a) says nothing about geography. \u201cUnder\u201d can\n logically mean \u201cin accordance with.\u201d And a nongeographical inter-\n pretation provides each word in the phrase \u201clawfully made under this\n title\u201d with a distinct purpose: \u201clawfully made\u201d suggests an effort to\n distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,\n and \u201cunder this title\u201d sets forth the standard of \u201clawful[ness]\u201d (i.e.,\n the U. S. Copyright Act). This simple reading promotes the tradi-\n tional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-\n word linguistic sense.\n    In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic\n difficulties. Wiley first reads \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cin conformance with\n the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.\u201d Wiley then\n argues that the Act \u201cis applicable\u201d only in the United States. Howev-\n er, neither \u201cunder\u201d nor any other word in \u201clawfully made under this\n title\u201d means \u201cwhere.\u201d Nor can a geographical limitation be read into\n the word \u201capplicable.\u201d The fact that the Act does not instantly pro-\n tect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking\n place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made\n abroad. Indeed, \u00a7602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies sub-\n ject to the Copyright Act. And \u00a7104 says that works \u201csubject to pro-\n tection\u201d include unpublished works \u201cwithout regard to the [author\u2019s]\n nationality or domicile,\u201d and works \u201cfirst published\u201d in any of the\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nnearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright treaty with the\nUnited States. Pp. 8\u201312.\n     (2) Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate\nthat Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the pre-\nsent version of \u00a7109(a). A comparison of the language in \u00a7109(a)\u2019s\npredecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion. The\nformer version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but\nmere possessors who \u201clawfully obtained\u201d a copy, while the present\nversion covers only owners of a \u201clawfully made\u201d copy. This new lan-\nguage, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection but one who owns a copy\nwill be protected, provided that the copy was \u201clawfully made.\u201d A\nnongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions\nof the present statute. For example, the \u201cmanufacturing clause,\u201d\nwhich limited importation of many copies printed outside the United\nStates, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies\nmade in America and copies made abroad. But that \u201cequal treat-\nment\u201d principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpreta-\ntion that would grant an American copyright holder permanent con-\ntrol over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed\nabroad but not those printed in America. Finally, the Court normally\npresumes that the words \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d carry the\nsame meaning when they appear in different but related sections,\nand it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the conse-\nquences produced by a geographical interpretation. Pp. 12\u201316.\n     (3) A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of\nstatutory interpretation that \u201cwhen a statute covers an issue previ-\nously governed by the common law,\u201d it is presumed that \u201cCongress\nintended to retain the substance of the common law.\u201d Samantar v.\nYousuf, 560 U. S. ___, ___. The common-law \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine,\nwhich has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical\ndistinctions. Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co.\nv. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, where this Court first applied the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine, or in \u00a7109(a)\u2019s predecessor provision, which Congress enact-\ned a year later. Pp. 17\u201319.\n     (4) Library associations, used-book dealers, technology compa-\nnies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways\nin which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic\nconstitutional copyright objectives, in particular \u201cpromot[ing] the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. For example, a\ngeographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely re-\nquire libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books\nin their collections that were printed overseas. Wiley counters that\nsuch problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court\n4             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    first adopted a geographical interpretation. But the law has not been\n    settled for so long in Wiley\u2019s favor. The Second Circuit in this case\n    was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical inter-\n    pretation. Reliance on the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine is also deeply embed-\n    ded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers,\n    who have long relied on its protection. And the fact that harm has\n    proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright\n    holders to assert geographically based resale rights. Thus, the prac-\n    tical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,\n    extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant\u2014\n    particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade\n    to America. Pp. 19\u201324.\n       (c) Several additional arguments that Wiley and the dissent make\n    in support of a geographical interpretation are unpersuasive.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants \u201cthe owner of\ncopyright under this title\u201d certain \u201cexclusive rights,\u201d\nincluding the right \u201cto distribute copies . . . of the copy\u00ad\nrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of\nownership.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7106(3). These rights are quali\u00ad\nfied, however, by the application of various limitations set\nforth in the next several sections of the Act, \u00a7\u00a7107 through\n122. Those sections, typically entitled \u201cLimitations on\nexclusive rights,\u201d include, for example, the principle of\n\u201cfair use\u201d (\u00a7107), permission for limited library archival\nreproduction, (\u00a7108), and the doctrine at issue here, the\n\u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine (\u00a7109).\n   Section 109(a) sets forth the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine as\nfollows:\n    \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3) [the\n    section that grants the owner exclusive distribution\n    rights], the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord\n    lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without\n    the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or other\u00ad\n    wise dispose of the possession of that copy or\n2          KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    phonorecord.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThus, even though \u00a7106(3) forbids distribution of a copy of,\nsay, the copyrighted novel Herzog without the copyright\nowner\u2019s permission, \u00a7109(a) adds that, once a copy of Her-\nzog has been lawfully sold (or its ownership otherwise\nlawfully transferred), the buyer of that copy and subse\u00ad\nquent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish. In\ncopyright jargon, the \u201cfirst sale\u201d has \u201cexhausted\u201d the\ncopyright owner\u2019s \u00a7106(3) exclusive distribution right.\n   What, however, if the copy of Herzog was printed abroad\nand then initially sold with the copyright owner\u2019s permis\u00ad\nsion? Does the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine still apply? Is the\nbuyer, like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,\nfree to bring the copy into the United States and dispose of\nit as he or she wishes?\n   To put the matter technically, an \u201cimportation\u201d provi\u00ad\nsion, \u00a7602(a)(1), says that\n    \u201c[i]mportation into the United States, without the au\u00ad\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies . . . of a work that have been acquired outside\n    the United States is an infringement of the exclusive\n    right to distribute copies . . . under section 106 . . . .\u201d\n    17 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis\n    added).\n   Thus \u00a7602(a)(1) makes clear that importing a copy\nwithout permission violates the owner\u2019s exclusive distri-\nbution right. But in doing so, \u00a7602(a)(1) refers explicitly to\nthe \u00a7106(3) exclusive distribution right. As we have just\nsaid, \u00a7106 is by its terms \u201c[s]ubject to\u201d the various doc\u00ad\ntrines and principles contained in \u00a7\u00a7107 through 122, in-\ncluding \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d limitation. Do those same\nmodifications apply\u2014in particular, does the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\nmodification apply\u2014when considering whether \u00a7602(a)(1)\nprohibits importing a copy?\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145 (1998), we held that\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s reference to \u00a7106(3)\u2019s exclusive distribution\nright incorporates the later subsections\u2019 limitations, in\u00ad\ncluding, in particular, the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine of \u00a7109.\nThus, it might seem that, \u00a7602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one\nwho buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into\nthe United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he\nbought the copy in the United States.\n  But Quality King considered an instance in which the\ncopy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufac\u00ad\ntured in the United States (and then sent abroad and\nsold). This case is like Quality King but for one important\nfact. The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.\nThat fact is important because \u00a7109(a) says that the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine applies to \u201ca particular copy or phonorecord\nlawfully made under this title.\u201d And we must decide here\nwhether the five words, \u201clawfully made under this title,\u201d\nmake a critical legal difference.\n  Putting section numbers to the side, we ask whether\nthe \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other\nlawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully\nmanufactured abroad. Can that buyer bring that copy\ninto the United States (and sell it or give it away) without\nobtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner?\nCan, for example, someone who purchases, say at a used\nbookstore, a book printed abroad subsequently resell it\nwithout the copyright owner\u2019s permission?\n  In our view, the answers to these questions are, yes. We\nhold that the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to copies of a\ncopyrighted work lawfully made abroad.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publishes aca-\ndemic textbooks.

A dissenting judge thought that\nthe words \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d do not refer \u201cto\na place of manufacture\u201d but rather \u201cfocu[s] on whether a\nparticular copy was manufactured lawfully under\u201d Amer-\nica\u2019s copyright statute, and that \u201cthe lawfulness of the\nmanufacture of a particular copy should be judged by U.

The Second Circuit, the Ninth\nCircuit, Wiley, and the Solicitor General (as amicus) all\nread those words as imposing a form of geographical limi\u00ad\ntation. The Second Circuit held that they limit the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine to particular copies \u201cmade in territories in\nwhich the Copyright Act is law,\u201d which (the Circuit says)\nare copies \u201cmanufactured domestically,\u201d not \u201coutside of the\nUnited States.\u201d 654 F. 3d, at 221\u2013222 (emphasis added).\nWiley agrees that those five words limit the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine \u201cto copies made in conformance with the [United\nStates] Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is appli\u00ad\ncable,\u201d which (Wiley says) means it does not apply to copies\nmade \u201coutside the United States\u201d and at least not to \u201cfor\u00ad\neign production of a copy for distribution exclusively\nabroad.\u201d Brief for Respondent 15\u201316. Similarly, the\nSolicitor General says that those five words limit the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine\u2019s applicability to copies \u201c \u2018made subject to\nand in compliance with [the Copyright Act],\u2019 \u201d which (the\nSolicitor General says) are copies \u201cmade in the United\nStates.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5\n(hereinafter Brief for United States) (emphasis added).\nAnd the Ninth Circuit has held that those words limit the\n\u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine\u2019s applicability (1) to copies lawfully\nmade in the United States, and (2) to copies lawfully made\noutside the United States but initially sold in the United\nStates with the copyright owner\u2019s permission.

Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., 84 F. 3d 1143, 1149\u20131150\n(1996).\n   Under any of these geographical interpretations,\n\u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine would not apply to the Wiley\nAsia books at issue here. And, despite an American copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s permission to make copies abroad, one who\nbuys a copy of any such book or other copyrighted work\u2014\nwhether at a retail store, over the Internet, or at a library\nsale\u2014could not resell (or otherwise dispose of) that partic\u00ad\nular copy without further permission.\n   Kirtsaeng, however, reads the words \u201clawfully made\nunder this title\u201d as imposing a non-geographical limita\u00ad\ntion. He says that they mean made \u201cin accordance with\u201d\nor \u201cin compliance with\u201d the Copyright Act. Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 26. In that case, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine\nwould apply to copyrighted works as long as their manu\u00ad\nfacture met the requirements of American copyright law.\nIn particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here,\ncopies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the\ncopyright owner. See \u00a7106 (referring to the owner\u2019s right\nto authorize).\n   In our view, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s language, its context, and the\ncommon-law history of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine, taken\ntogether, favor a non-geographical interpretation. We also\ndoubt that Congress would have intended to create the\npractical copyright-related harms with which a geograph\u00ad\nical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,\nartistic, commercial, and consumer activities. See Part II\u2013\nD, infra. We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng\u2019s\nnongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.\n                            A\n  The language of \u00a7109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng\u2019s\nnongeographical interpretation, namely, that \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d means made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or\n\u201cin compliance with\u201d the Copyright Act. The language of\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7109(a) says nothing about geography. The word \u201cunder\u201d\ncan mean \u201c[i]n accordance with.\u201d 18 Oxford English Dic\u00ad\ntionary 950 (2d ed. 1989). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n1525 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201caccording to\u201d). And a nongeograph\u00ad\nical interpretation provides each word of the five-word\nphrase with a distinct purpose. The first two words of the\nphrase, \u201clawfully made,\u201d suggest an effort to distinguish\nthose copies that were made lawfully from those that were\nnot, and the last three words, \u201cunder this title,\u201d set forth\nthe standard of \u201clawful[ness].\u201d Thus, the nongeograph-\nical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright\nobjective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word\nlinguistic sense.\n   The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with\nlinguistic difficulties. It gives the word \u201clawfully\u201d little,\nif any, linguistic work to do. (How could a book be unlaw\u00ad\nfully \u201cmade under this title\u201d?) It imports geography into a\nstatutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.\nAnd it is far more complex than may at first appear.\n   To read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first empha\u00ad\nsize the word \u201cunder.\u201d Indeed, Wiley reads \u201cunder this\ntitle\u201d to mean \u201cin conformance with the Copyright Act\nwhere the Copyright Act is applicable.\u201d Brief for Respond\u00ad\nent 15. Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that\nthe Act \u201cis applicable\u201d only in the United States. Ibid.\nAnd the Solicitor General must do the same. See Brief for\nUnited States 6 (\u201cA copy is \u2018lawfully made under this title\u2019\nif Title 17 governs the copy\u2019s creation and the copy is made\nin compliance with Title 17\u2019s requirements\u201d). See also\npost, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (\u201cunder\u201d describes\nsomething \u201cgoverned or regulated by another\u201d).\n    One difficulty is that neither \u201cunder\u201d nor any other\nword in the phrase means \u201cwhere.\u201d See, e.g., 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, supra, at 947\u2013952 (definition of \u201cun\u00ad\nder\u201d). It might mean \u201csubject to,\u201d see post, at 6, but as this\n10        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a\nuniform, consistent meaning. See Kucana v. Holder, 558\nU. S. 233, 245 (2010) (\u201c \u2018under\u2019 is chameleon\u201d); Ardestani v.\nINS, 502 U. S. 129, 135 (1991) (\u201cunder\u201d has \u201cmany dic\u00ad\ntionary definitions\u201d and \u201cmust draw its meaning from its\ncontext\u201d).\n   A far more serious difficulty arises out of the uncer\u00ad\ntainty and complexity surrounding the second step\u2019s effort\nto read the necessary geographical limitation into the word\n\u201capplicable\u201d (or the equivalent). Where, precisely, is the\nCopyright Act \u201capplicable\u201d? The Act does not instantly\nprotect an American copyright holder from unauthorized\npiracy taking place abroad. But that fact does not mean\nthe Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad. As a matter\nof ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing,\nsay, a tariff upon \u201cany rhododendron grown in Nepal\u201d\napplies to all Nepalese rhododendrons. And, similarly,\none can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable\nto all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.\nIndeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are \u201csub\u00ad\nject to\u201d the Act. \u00a7602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer-\nring to importation of copies \u201cthe making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would\nhave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title\nhad been applicable\u201d); Brief for United States 5. See also\npost, at 6 (suggesting that \u201cmade under\u201d may be read as\n\u201csubject to\u201d).\n   The appropriateness of this linguistic usage is under\u00ad\nscored by the fact that \u00a7104 of the Act itself says that\nworks \u201csubject to protection under this title\u201d include un\u00ad\npublished works \u201cwithout regard to the nationality or\ndomicile of the author,\u201d and works \u201cfirst published\u201d in any\none of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright\ntreaty with the United States. \u00a7\u00a7104(a), (b) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added); \u00a7101 (2006 ed., Supp. V) (defining\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A,\nInternational Copyright Relations of the United States\n(2010). Thus, ordinary English permits us to say that the\nAct \u201capplies\u201d to an Irish manuscript lying in its author\u2019s\nDublin desk drawer as well as to an original recording of\na ballet performance first made in Japan and now on\ndisplay in a Kyoto art gallery.

As we said, that Cir\u00ad\ncuit interprets the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine to cover both (1)\ncopies manufactured in the United States and (2) copies\nmanufactured abroad but first sold in the United States\nwith the American copyright owner\u2019s permission. Den\u00ad\nbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d, at 1149\u20131150.

As we shall later describe, see Part II\u2013D, infra,\nwithout some such qualification a copyright holder could\nprevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving\naway copies of a video game made in Japan, a film made\nin Germany, or a dress (with a design copyright) made in\nChina, even if the copyright holder has granted permission\nfor the foreign manufacture, importation, and an initial\n12         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic sale of the copy. A publisher such as Wiley\nwould be free to print its books abroad, allow their im-\nportation and sale within the United States, but prohibit\nstudents from later selling their used texts at a campus\nbookstore. We see no way, however, to reconcile this half\u00ad\ngeographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the\nlanguage of the phrase, \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d\nAs a matter of English, it would seem that those five\nwords either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they\ndo not.\n   In sum, we believe that geographical interpretations\ncreate more linguistic problems than they resolve. And\nconsiderations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely\nlinguistic balance in Kirtsaeng\u2019s, nongeographical, favor.\n                           B\n  Both historical and contemporary statutory context in\u00ad\ndicate that Congress, when writing the present version of\n\u00a7109(a), did not have geography in mind. In respect to\nhistory, we compare \u00a7109(a)\u2019s present language with the\nlanguage of its immediate predecessor. That predecessor\nsaid:\n     \u201c[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, pre\u00ad\n     vent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copy\u00ad\n     righted work the possession of which has been lawfully\n     obtained.\u201d Copyright Act of 1909, \u00a741, 35 Stat. 1084\n     (emphasis added).\n  See also Copyright Act of 1947, \u00a727, 61 Stat. 660. The\npredecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does\nnot argue that it does). So we ask whether Congress, in\nchanging its language implicitly introduced a geograph-\nical limitation that previously was lacking. See also Part\nII\u2013C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law\nprinciple).\n  A comparison of language indicates that it did not. The\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor says that the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine protects \u201cthe\ntransfer of any copy the possession of which has been\nlawfully obtained.\u201d The present version says that \u201cthe\nowner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\nunder this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of\nthe possession of that copy or phonorecord.\u201d What does\nthis change in language accomplish?\n   The language of the former version referred to those\nwho are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who\n\u201clawfully obtained\u201d a copy. The present version covers\nonly those who are owners of a \u201clawfully made\u201d copy.\nWhom does the change leave out? Who might have law-\nfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned\nthat copy? One answer is owners of movie theaters, who\nduring the 1970\u2019s (and before) often leased films from\nmovie distributors or filmmakers.         See S. Donahue,\nAmerican Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing\nproducer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements);\nNote, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribu\u00ad\ntion and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of Anti-\nBlind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L. J. 131, 135\n(1986). Because the theater owners had \u201clawfully ob\u00ad\ntained\u201d their copies, the earlier version could be read as\nallowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given\nthem \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection. Because the theater owners\nwere lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in\nlanguage makes clear that they (like bailees and other\nlessees) cannot take advantage of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine.\n(Those who find legislative history useful will find confir\u00ad\nmation in, e.g., House Committee on the Judiciary, Copy\u00ad\nright Law Revision, Supplementary Report of the Register\nof Copyrights on the General Revision of the U.

Republic Graphics, Inc.,\n315 F. 2d 847, 851 (CA2 1963) (Friendly, J.) (pointing out\npredecessor statute\u2019s leasing problem)).\n    This objective perfectly well explains the new language\nof the present version, including the five words here at\nissue. Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection but one who\nowns a copy will receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection, provided, of\ncourse, that the copy was \u201clawfully made\u201d and not pi-\nrated. The new language also takes into account that a\ncopy may be \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d when the copy,\nsay of a phonorecord, comes into its owner\u2019s possession\nthrough use of a compulsory license, which \u201cthis title\u201d\nprovides for elsewhere, namely, in \u00a7115. Again, for those\nwho find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative\nreport makes this clear. H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131476, p. 79\n(1976) (\u201cFor example, any resale of an illegally \u2018pirated\u2019\nphonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition\nof a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory li\u00ad\ncensing provisions of section 115 would not\u201d).\n    Other provisions of the present statute also support\na nongeographical interpretation. For one thing, the stat\u00ad\nute phases out the \u201cmanufacturing clause,\u201d a clause that\nappeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation\nof many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the\nUnited States. \u00a7601, 90 Stat. 2588 (\u201cPrior to July 1, 1982\n. . . the importation into or public distribution in the\nUnited States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly\nof nondramatic literary material . . . is prohibited unless\nthe portions consisting of such material have been manufac-\ntured in the United States or Canada\u201d). The phasing out\nof this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manu\u00ad\nfactured in America and copies manufactured abroad. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131476, at 165\u2013166.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The \u201cequal treatment\u201d principle, however, is difficult\nto square with a geographical interpretation of the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d clause that would grant the holder of an American\ncopyright (perhaps a foreign national, see supra, at 10)\npermanent control over the American distribution chain\n(sales, resales, gifts, and other distribution) in respect to\ncopies printed abroad but not in respect to copies printed\nin America. And it is particularly difficult to believe that\nCongress would have sought this unequal treatment while\nsaying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the\nmanufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of\npolicy goal.

To inter\u00ad\n     pret these words geographically means that an arcade\n     owner could not (\u201cwithout the authority of the copyright\n     owner\u201d) perform or display arcade games (whether new\n     or used) originally made in Japan.

In the early 17th century\nLord Coke explained the common law\u2019s refusal to permit\nrestraints on the alienation of chattels. Referring to Lit\u00ad\ntleton, who wrote in the 15th century, Gray, Two Contri\u00ad\nbutions to Coke Studies, 72 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1127, 1135\n(2005), Lord Coke wrote:\n    \u201c[If] a man be possessed of . . . a horse, or of any other\n    chattell . . . and give or sell his whole interest . . .\n    therein upon condition that the Donee or Vendee shall\n    not alien[ate] the same, the [condition] is voi[d], be\u00ad\n    cause his whole interest . . . is out of him, so as he\n    hath no possibilit[y] of a Reverter, and it is against\n    Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and contracting\n    betwee[n] man and man: and it is within the reason of\n    our Author that it should ouster him of all power\n    given to him.\u201d 1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of\n    England \u00a7360, p. 223 (1628).\n  A law that permits a copyright holder to control the\nresale or other disposition of a chattel once sold is simi-\nlarly \u201cagainst Trade and Traffi[c], and bargaining and con-\ntracting.\u201d Ibid.\n  With these last few words, Coke emphasizes the im\u00ad\n18         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nportance of leaving buyers of goods free to compete with\neach other when reselling or otherwise disposing of those\ngoods. American law too has generally thought that com\u00ad\npetition, including freedom to resell, can work to the ad\u00ad\nvantage of the consumer. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather\nProducts, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877, 886 (2007)\n(restraints with \u201cmanifestly anticompetitive effects\u201d are\nper se illegal; others are subject to the rule of reason\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); 1 P. Areeda & H.\nHovenkamp, Antitrust Law \u00b6100, p. 4 (3d ed. 2006)\n(\u201c[T]he principal objective of antitrust policy is to maximize\nconsumer welfare by encouraging firms to behave\ncompetitively\u201d).\n   The \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine also frees courts from the ad\u00ad\nministrative burden of trying to enforce restrictions upon\ndifficult-to-trace, readily movable goods. And it avoids the\nselective enforcement inherent in any such effort. Thus, it\nis not surprising that for at least a century the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine has played an important role in American copy\u00ad\nright law. See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.

And we can find no language, context,\npurpose, or history that would rebut a \u201cstraightforward\napplication\u201d of that doctrine here.\n   The dissent argues that another principle of statutory\ninterpretation works against our reading, and points out\nthat elsewhere in the statute Congress used different\nwords to express something like the non-geographical\nreading we adopt.

Hence, Con\u00ad\ngress, the dissent believes, must have meant \u00a7109(a)\u2019s\ndifferent language to mean something different (such as\nthe dissent\u2019s own geographical interpretation of \u00a7109(a)).\nWe are not aware, however, of any canon of interpretation\nthat forbids interpreting different words used in different\nparts of the same statute to mean roughly the same thing.\nRegardless, were there such a canon, the dissent\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation of \u00a7109(a) would also violate it.

The Second Circuit,\nin its decision below, is the first Court of Appeals to adopt\na purely geographical interpretation. The Third Circuit\nhas favored a nongeographical interpretation. Sebastian\nInt\u2019l, 847 F. 2d 1093.

Museums, for example, are\nnot in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to\ncheck with the heirs of copyright owners before sending,\ne.g., a Picasso on tour. Brief for Association of Art Mu\u00ad\nseum Directors 11\u201312. That inertia means a dramatic\nchange is likely necessary before these institutions, in\u00ad\nstructed by their counsel, would begin to engage in the\ncomplex permission-verifying process that a geographical\ninterpretation would demand. And this Court\u2019s adoption\nof the geographical interpretation could provide that\ndramatic change. These intolerable consequences (along\nwith the absurd result that the copyright owner can ex-\nercise downstream control even when it authorized the\nimport or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth\nCircuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to\n24        KIRTSAENG v.

But those readings are not defensible, for\nthey require too many unprecedented jumps over linguis\u00ad\ntic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.\nSee, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of\n\u00a7106(3) \u201csignificantly curtails the independent effect of\n\u00a7109(a)\u201d).\n   Finally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far\nmay simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so\nfar to assert geographically based resale rights. They may\ndecide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.\nRegardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only\nif unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that\nwould create uncertainty, would bring about selective\nenforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disre\u00ad\nspect for copyright law itself.\n   Thus, we believe that the practical problems that peti\u00ad\ntioner and his amici have described are too serious, too\nextensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss\nthem as insignificant\u2014particularly in light of the ever\u00ad\ngrowing importance of foreign trade to America. See\nThe World Bank, Imports of goods and services (% of\nGDP) (imports in 2011 18% of U.

(as visited\nMar. 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\nThe upshot is that copyright-related consequences along\nwith language, context, and interpretive canons argue\nstrongly against a geographical interpretation of \u00a7109(a).\n                            III\n  Wiley and the dissent make several additional impor\u00ad\ntant arguments in favor of the geographical interpretation.\nFirst, they say that our Quality King decision strongly\nsupports its geographical interpretation.

S., at 138\u2013139.\n  We held that the importation provision did not prohibit\nsending the products back into the United States (without\nthe copyright owner\u2019s permission). That section says:\n    \u201cImportation into the United States, without the au\u00ad\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n    acquired outside the United States is an infringement\n    of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono\u00ad\n    records under section 106.\u201d 17 U.

See also\n    \u00a7602(a) (1994 ed.).\n   We pointed out that this section makes importation an\ninfringement of the \u201cexclusive right to distribute . . . under\n106.\u201d We noted that \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine limits\nthe scope of the \u00a7106 exclusive distribution right. We took\nas given the fact that the products at issue had at least\nonce been sold.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n349\u2013350.\n   We also explained why we rejected the claim that our\ninterpretation would make \u00a7602(a)(1) pointless. Those\nadvancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copy\u00ad\nright Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provi\u00ad\nsion, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies. Qual\u00ad\nity King, supra, at 146. Thus, they said, \u00a7602(a)(1) must\nprohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to\nallow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a\nfirst sale, as Quality King\u2019s holding would do, would leave\n\u00a7602(a)(1) without much to prohibit. It would become\nsuperfluous, without any real work to do.\n   We do not believe that this argument is a strong one.\nUnder Quality King\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7602(a)(1) would still\nforbid importing (without permission, and subject to the\nexceptions in \u00a7602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for\nexample, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the\nlicensee of an American publisher prints copies of a book\noverseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send\nthem to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other\nmanufacturer (if not the \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of \u00a7109(a),\ne.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted\ngoods to the United States; (3) \u201ca book publisher trans\u00ad\nports copies to a wholesaler\u201d and the wholesaler (not yet\nthe owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright\nLaw Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4)\na foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri-\nbution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to\nsend them to the United States. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on\nCopyright \u00a78.12[B][1][a], at 8\u2013159 (\u201cSection 109(a) pro\u00ad\nvides that the distribution right may be exercised solely\nwith respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,\nnot to prevent or restrict the resale or other further trans\u00ad\nfer of possession of such copies\u201d). These examples show\nthat \u00a7602(a)(1) retains significance. We concede it has less\nsignificance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent also adopts a construction of \u00a7106(3) that \u201csignifi\u00ad\ncantly curtails\u201d \u00a7109(a)\u2019s effect, post, at 26, and so limits\nthe scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater,\ndegree.\n   In Quality King we rejected the \u201csuperfluous\u201d argument\nfor similar reasons. But, when rejecting it, we said that,\nwhere an author gives exclusive American distribution\nrights to an American publisher and exclusive British\ndistribution rights to a British publisher, \u201cpresumably\nonly those [copies] made by the publisher of the United\nStates edition would be \u2018lawfully made under this title\u2019\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7109(a).\u201d 523 U. S., at 148 (empha\u00ad\nsis added). Wiley now argues that this phrase in the\nQuality King opinion means that books published abroad\n(under license) must fall outside the words \u201clawfully made\nunder this title\u201d and that we have consequently already\ngiven those words the geographical interpretation that it\nfavors.\n   We cannot, however, give the Quality King statement\nthe legal weight for which Wiley argues. The language\n\u201clawfully made under this title\u201d was not at issue in Qual\u00ad\nity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued;\nwe did not canvas the considerations we have here set\nforth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example\nassumes a \u201cfirst sale\u201d; and we there hedged our state-\nment with the word \u201cpresumably.\u201d Most importantly, the\nstatement is pure dictum. It is dictum contained in a\nrebuttal to a counterargument. And it is unnecessary\ndictum even in that respect. Is the Court having once\nwritten dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny\nthat it is a fruit forever after?\n   To the contrary, we have written that we are not neces\u00ad\nsarily bound by dicta should more complete argument\ndemonstrate that the dicta is not correct.

And, given the bit part that our Quality\nKing statement played in our Quality King decision, we\nbelieve the view of stare decisis set forth in these opinions\napplies to the matter now before us.\n   Second, Wiley and the dissent argue (to those who con\u00ad\nsider legislative history) that the Act\u2019s legislative history\nsupports their interpretation. But the historical events to\nwhich it points took place more than a decade before the\nenactment of the Act and, at best, are inconclusive.\n   During the 1960\u2019s, representatives of book, record, and\nfilm industries, meeting with the Register of Copyrights to\ndiscuss copyright revision, complained about the difficulty\nof dividing international markets.

It said:\n    \u201cImportation into the United States of copies or rec\u00ad\n    ords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the\n    public shall, if such articles are imported without the\n    authority of the owner of the exclusive right to distrib-\n    ute copies or records under this title, constitute an\n    infringement of copyright actionable under section 35\n    [17 U.

Print\n    1964).\n  In discussing the draft, some of those present expressed\nconcern about its effect on the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine. For\nexample, Irwin Karp, representing the Authors League\nof America asked, \u201cIf a German jobber lawfully buys cop-\nies from a German publisher, are we not running into the\nproblem of restricting his transfer of his lawfully obtained\ncopies?\u201d Id., pt. 4, at 211. The Copyright Office repre\u00ad\nsentative replied, \u201cThis could vary from one situation to\nanother, I guess. I should guess, for example, that if\na book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a\nwholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of\ntransaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.\u201d\nIbid. (emphasis added).\n  The Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a\ndraft, which, by explicitly referring to \u00a7106, was similar to\nthe provision that became law, now \u00a7602(a)(1). The Office\nnoted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of\na copy (without permission) \u201cwould violate the exclusive\nrights of the U. S. copyright owner . . . where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign\ncountry for distribution only in that country.\u201d Id., pt. 6, at\n150.\n  Still, that part of the report says nothing about the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine, about \u00a7109(a), or about the five words,\n30         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d And neither the report\nnor its accompanying 1960\u2019s draft answers the question\nbefore us here. Cf. Quality King, 523 U. S., at 145 (with\u00ad\nout those five words, the import clause, via its reference to\n\u00a7106, imports the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine).\n   But to ascertain the best reading of \u00a7109(a), rather\nthan dissecting the remarks of industry representatives\nconcerning \u00a7602 at congressional meetings held 10 years\nbefore the statute was enacted, see post, at 13\u201316, we\nwould give greater weight to the congressional report\naccompanying \u00a7109(a), written a decade later when Con\u00ad\ngress passed the new law. That report says:\n       \u201cSection 109(a) restates and confirms the principle\n     that, where the copyright owner has transferred own\u00ad\n     ership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work,\n     the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is trans\u00ad\n     ferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any\n     other means. Under this principle, which has been\n     established by the court decisions and . . . the present\n     law, the copyright owner\u2019s exclusive right of public\n     distribution would have no effect upon anyone who\n     owns \u2018a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\n     under this title\u2019 and who wishes to transfer it to\n     someone else or to destroy it.\n      .             .               .          .             .\n        \u201cTo come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy\n     or phonorecord must have been \u2018lawfully made under\n     this title,\u2019 though not necessarily with the copyright\n     owner\u2019s authorization. For example, any resale of an\n     illegally \u2018pirated\u2019 phonorecord would be an infringe\u00ad\n     ment but the disposition of a phonorecord legally\n     made under the compulsory licensing provisions of\n     section 115 would not.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131476, at 79\n     (emphasis added).\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             31\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nAccord, S. Rep. No. 94\u2013473, pp. 71\u201372 (1975).\n   This history reiterates the importance of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Copyright Law Revision, 1964 Revision\nBill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess., pt. 5, p. 66 (Comm. Print 1965) (\u201c[F]ull ownership of\na lawfully-made copy authorizes its owner to dispose of\nit freely\u201d). It explains, as we have explained, the nongeo\u00ad\ngraphical purposes of the words \u201clawfully made under this\ntitle.\u201d Part II\u2013B, supra. And it says nothing about geog\u00ad\nraphy. Nor, importantly, did \u00a7109(a)\u2019s predecessor provi\u00ad\nsion. See supra, at 12. This means that, contrary to the\ndissent\u2019s suggestion, any lack of legislative history per\u00ad\ntaining to the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine only tends to bolster\nour position that Congress\u2019 1976 revision did not intend to\ncreate a drastic geographical change in its revision to that\nprovision. See post, at 18, n. 13. We consequently believe\nthat the legislative history, on balance, supports the non-\ngeographical interpretation.\n   Third, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeograph\u00ad\nical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impos\u00ad\nsible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide\nforeign and domestic markets. We concede that is so. A\npublisher may find it more difficult to charge different\nprices for the same book in different geographic markets.\nBut we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can\nfind no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that\npublishers are especially entitled to such rights.\n   The Constitution describes the nature of American\ncopyright law by providing Congress with the power to\n\u201csecur[e]\u201d to \u201c[a]uthors\u201d \u201cfor limited [t]imes\u201d the \u201cexclusive\n[r]ight to their . . . [w]ritings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. The Found\u00ad\ners, too, discussed the need to grant an author a limited\nright to exclude competition. Compare Letter from Thomas\nJefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 442\u2013443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956)\n(arguing against any monopoly) with Letter from James\n32        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at\n16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) (arguing for a limited monopoly\nto secure production). But the Constitution\u2019s language\nnowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should\ninclude a right to divide markets or a concomitant right\nto charge different purchasers different prices for the same\nbook, say to increase or to maximize gain. Neither, to our\nknowledge, did any Founder make any such suggestion.\nWe have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference\nfor interpretations of copyright statutes that would pro\u00ad\nvide for market divisions. Cf. Copyright Law Revision, pt.\n2, at 194 (statement of Barbara Ringer, Copyright Office)\n(division of territorial markets was \u201cprimarily a matter of\nprivate contract\u201d).\n   To the contrary, Congress enacted a copyright law that\n(through the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine) limits copyright holders\u2019\nability to divide domestic markets. And that limitation is\nconsistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid mar\u00ad\nket divisions. Cf. Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46,\n49\u201350 (1990) (per curiam) (\u201c[A]greements between compet\u00ad\nitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are\nillegal\u201d). Whether copyright owners should, or should\nnot, have more than ordinary commercial power to divide\ninternational markets is a matter for Congress to decide.\nWe do no more here than try to determine what decision\nCongress has taken.\n   Fourth, the dissent and Wiley contend that our decision\nlaunches United States copyright law into an unprece\u00ad\ndented regime of \u201cinternational exhaustion.\u201d Post, at 18\u2013\n23; Brief for Respondent 45\u201346. But they point to nothing\nindicative of congressional intent in 1976. The dissent\nalso claims that it is clear that the United States now\nopposes adopting such a regime, but the Solicitor General\nas amicus has taken no such position in this case. In fact,\nwhen pressed at oral argument, the Solicitor General\nstated that the consequences of Wiley\u2019s reading of the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           33\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute (perpetual downstream control) were \u201cworse\u201d than\nthose of Kirtsaeng\u2019s reading (restriction of market seg\u00ad\nmentation). Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. And the dissent\u2019s reliance\non the Solicitor General\u2019s position in Quality King is under-\nmined by his agreement in that case with our reading\nof \u00a7109(a). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 1470, p. 30 (\u201cWhen . . .

But our holding in Quality King that\n\u00a7109(a) is a defense in U. S. courts even when \u201cthe first\nsale occurred abroad,\u201d 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14, has already\nsignificantly eroded such a principle.\n                             IV\n  For these reasons we conclude that the considerations\nsupporting Kirtsaeng\u2019s nongeographical interpretation of\nthe words \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d are the more\npersuasive. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Neither the text\nnor the history of 17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a) supports removing\nfirst-sale protection from every copy of a protected work\nmanufactured abroad. See ante, at 8\u201316, 28\u201331. I recog-\nnize, however, that the combination of today\u2019s decision\nand Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135 (1998), constricts the scope of\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation. I write to\nsuggest that any problems associated with that limitation\ncome not from our reading of \u00a7109(a) here, but from Qual-\nity King\u2019s holding that \u00a7109(a) limits \u00a7602(a)(1).\n   As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played\nan integral part in American copyright law for over a\ncentury. See ante, at 17\u201319; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,\n210 U. S. 339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior\nto 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies\nmade in the United States. See ante, at 12. And nothing\nin the text or history of \u00a7109(a)\u2014the Copyright Act of\n1976\u2019s first-sale provision\u2014suggests that Congress meant\nto enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley\nproposes, which at once would deprive American consum-\ners of important rights and encourage copyright holders to\nmanufacture abroad. See ante, at 8\u201316, 28\u201331.\n2           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n   That said, John Wiley is right that the Court\u2019s decision,\nwhen combined with Quality King, substantially narrows\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation. Quality\nKing held that the importation ban does not reach any\ncopies receiving first-sale protection under \u00a7109(a). See\n523 U. S., at 151\u2013152. So notwithstanding \u00a7602(a)(1), an\n\u201cowner of a particular copy . . . lawfully made under this\ntitle\u201d can import that copy without the copyright owner\u2019s\npermission. \u00a7109(a). In now holding that copies \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d include copies manufactured\nabroad, we unavoidably diminish \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s scope\u2014\nindeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See\nante, at 26\u201327.\n   But if Congress views the shrinking of \u00a7602(a)(1) as a\nproblem, it should recognize Quality King\u2014not our deci-\nsion today\u2014as the culprit. Here, after all, we merely\nconstrue \u00a7109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that\n\u00a7109(a) limits \u00a7602(a)(1). Had we come out the opposite\nway in that case, \u00a7602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner\nto restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the\nfirst-sale doctrine.1 That result would enable the copy-\nright owner to divide international markets in the way\nJohn Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting\n\u00a7602(a)(1). But it would do so without imposing down-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although Quality King concluded that the statute\u2019s text foreclosed\n\nthat outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151\u2013152, the Solicitor General offered a\ncogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that \u00a7109(a) does not\nlimit \u00a7602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to \u201csell\u201d or\n\u201cdispose\u201d of copies\u2014not to import them: The Act\u2019s first-sale provision\nand its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping\nspheres of conduct. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96\u20131470, pp. 5, 8\u201310. That reading\nremains the Government\u2019s preferred way of construing the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 44 (\u201c[W]e think that we still would adhere to our view\nthat section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section\n602(a)(1)\u201d); see also ante, at 32\u201333; post, at 21, n. 15 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 19. Assuming Congress\nadopted \u00a7602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I sus-\npect that is how Congress thought the provision would\nwork\u2014not by removing first-sale protection from every copy\nmanufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here),\nbut by enabling the copyright holder to control imports\neven when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King\nnow prevents).2\n  At bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks\nus to misconstrue \u00a7109(a) in order to restore \u00a7602(a)(1)\nto its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright\nholders to segment international markets. I think John\nWiley may have a point about what \u00a7602(a)(1) was de-\nsigned to do; that gives me pause about Quality King\u2019s\nholding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation\nban\u2019s scope. But the Court today correctly declines the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective\n\nof the first-sale doctrine\u2014i.e., reversing Quality King\u2014would yield a\nfar more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting\nJohn Wiley\u2019s argument here. That is because only the former approach\nturns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their\nplace of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley\nprints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain\nversions only in Thailand. Without Quality King, John Wiley could do\nso\u2014i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and pre-\nvent anyone from importing them back into the United States. But\nwith Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its\nreading of \u00a7109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-\nimporting the books\u2014and so to segment the Thai market\u2014John Wiley\nwould have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no reason\nwhy Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner\u2019s power to\ndivide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.\n4         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    KAGAN, J., concurring\n\ninvitation to save \u00a7602(a)(1) from Quality King by destroy-\ning the first-sale protection that \u00a7109(a) gives to every\nowner of a copy manufactured abroad. That would swap\none (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make\nour reading of the statute only less reflective of Congres-\nsional intent. If Congress thinks copyright owners need\ngreater power to restrict importation and thus divide\nmarkets, a ready solution is at hand\u2014not the one John\nWiley offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in\nQuality King.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The Court\u2019s bold\ndeparture from Congress\u2019 design is all the more stunning,\nfor it places the United States at the vanguard of the\nmovement for \u201cinternational exhaustion\u201d of copyrights\u2014a\nmovement the United States has steadfastly resisted on\nthe world stage.\n  To justify a holding that shrinks to insignificance copy\u00ad\nright protection against the unauthorized importation of\nforeign-made copies, the Court identifies several \u201cpractical\nproblems.\u201d Ante, at 24. The Court\u2019s parade of horribles,\nhowever, is largely imaginary. Congress\u2019 objective in\nenacting 17 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s importation prohibition\ncan be honored without generating the absurd conse\u00ad\nquences hypothesized in the Court\u2019s opinion. I dissent\n2         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the Court\u2019s embrace of \u201cinternational exhaustion,\u201d\nand would affirm the sound judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n   Because economic conditions and demand for particular\ngoods vary across the globe, copyright owners have a\nfinancial incentive to charge different prices for copies of\ntheir works in different geographic regions. Their ability\nto engage in such price discrimination, however, is under-\nmined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies\nfrom low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.\nThe question in this case is whether the unauthorized\nimportation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright\ninfringement under U. S. law.\n   To answer this question, one must examine three provi\u00ad\nsions of Title 17 of the U. S. Code: \u00a7\u00a7106(3), 109(a), and\n602(a)(1). Section 106 sets forth the \u201cexclusive rights\u201d of a\ncopyright owner, including the right \u201cto distribute copies\nor phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by\nsale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or\nlending.\u201d \u00a7106(3). This distribution right is limited by\n\u00a7109(a), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions\nof section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phono-\nrecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,\nwithout the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or\notherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or\nphonorecord.\u201d Section 109(a) codifies the \u201cfirst sale doc\u00ad\ntrine,\u201d a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.\nStraus, 210 U. S. 339, 349\u2013351 (1908), which held that a\ncopyright owner could not control the price at which re\u00ad\ntailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work. The\nfirst sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner\nshould not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over\nthe distribution of copies of a copyrighted work. At some\npoint\u2014ordinarily the time of the first commercial sale\u2014\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

It reads:\n        \u201cImportation into the United States, without the\n     authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n     acquired outside the United States is an infringe-\n     ment of the exclusive right to distribute copies or\n     phonorecords under section 106, actionable under sec\u00ad\n     tion 501.\u201d\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 143\u2013154 (1998), the Court held\nthat a copyright owner\u2019s right to control importation under\n\u00a7602(a)(1) is a component of the distribution right set forth\nin \u00a7106(3) and is therefore subject to \u00a7109(a)\u2019s codification\nof the first sale doctrine. Quality King thus held that\nthe importation of copies made in the United States but\nsold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement\nunder \u00a7602(a)(1). Id., at 143\u2013154. See also id., at 154\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring) (Quality King \u201cinvolve[d] a\n\u2018round trip\u2019 journey, travel of the copies in question from\nthe United States to places abroad, then back again\u201d).2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 In 2008, Congress renumbered what was previously \u00a7602(a) as\n\n\u00a7602(a)(1).

Like the\nCourt, I refer to the provision by its current numbering.\n  2 Although JUSTICE KAGAN\u2019s concurrence suggests that Quality King\n\nerred in \u201cholding that \u00a7109(a) limits \u00a7602(a)(1),\u201d ante, at 2, that recent,\nunanimous holding must be taken as a given.

The first sale doctrine\n     would not provide the publisher of the British edition\n     who decided to sell in the American market with a de\u00ad\n     fense to an action under \u00a7602(a) (or, for that matter,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nremains free to alter what we have done.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Patterson v.\nMcLean Credit Union, 491 U.

The Court\u2019s\nobjective in this case should be to avoid unduly \u201cconstrict[ing] the scope\nof \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation,\u201d ante, at 1 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), while at the same time remaining faithful to Quality King\u2019s\nholding and to the text and history of other Copyright Act provisions.\nThis aim is not difficult to achieve.

Petitioner Supap Kirtsaeng imported and then\nsold at a profit over 600 copies of copyrighted textbooks\nprinted outside the United States by the Asian subsidiary\nof respondent John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Wiley). App. 29\u2013\n34. See also ante, at 3\u20135 (opinion of the Court). In the\nwords the Court used in Quality King, these copies \u201cwere\n\u2018lawfully made\u2019 not under the United States Copyright\nAct, but instead, under the law of some other country.\u201d\n523 U.

Section 109(a) therefore does not ap-\nply, and Kirtsaeng\u2019s unauthorized importation constitutes\ncopyright infringement under \u00a7602(a)(1).\n   The Court does not deny that under the language I have\nquoted from Quality King, Wiley would prevail. Ante, at\n27. Nevertheless, the Court dismisses this language, to\nwhich all Members of the Quality King Court subscribed,\nas ill-considered dictum. Ante, at 27\u201328. I agree that the\ndiscussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essen\u00ad\ntial to the Court\u2019s judgment. See Quality King, 523 U. S.,\nat 154 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e do not today\nresolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports\nwere manufactured abroad.\u201d). But I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.\nInstead, for the reasons explained below, I would hold,\nconsistently with Quality King\u2019s dictum, that \u00a7602(a)(1)\nauthorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a\ncopy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.\n                            II\n  The text of the Copyright Act demonstrates that Con\u00ad\ngress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent\n6         KIRTSAENG v.

As the Court recognizes, ante, at\n3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d in \u00a7109(a). In my view, that phrase\nis most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a\ncopy\u2019s creation is governed by, and conducted in compli\u00ad\nance with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. This reading is\nconsistent with the Court\u2019s interpretation of similar lan\u00ad\nguage in other statutes. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v.\nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 52\u201353 (2008)\n(\u201cunder\u201d in 11 U. S.

Ac\u00ad\ncording to the Court, the phrase \u201c \u2018lawfully made under\nthis title\u2019 means made \u2018in accordance with\u2019 or \u2018in compli\u00ad\nance with\u2019 the Copyright Act.\u201d Ante, at 8. But the Court\noverlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites,\nante, at 9, the word \u201cunder\u201d commonly signals a relation\u00ad\nship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regu-\nlated by another. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed.\n1990) (\u201cunder\u201d \u201cfrequently\u201d means \u201cinferior\u201d or \u201csubordi\u00ad\nnate\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cunder\u201d means,\namong other things, \u201c[i]n accordance with (some regulative\npower or principle)\u201d (emphasis added)). See also Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (\u201cunder\u201d\nmeans, among other things, \u201cin . . . a condition of sub-\njection, regulation, or subordination\u201d and \u201csuffering re\u00ad\nstriction, restraint, or control by\u201d). Only by disregarding\nthis established meaning of \u201cunder\u201d can the Court arrive\nat the conclusion that Wiley\u2019s foreign-manufactured text\u00ad\nbooks were \u201clawfully made under\u201d U. S. copyright law,\neven though that law did not govern their creation. It is\nanomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as\n\u201clawful\u201d under an inapplicable law. For example, one\nmight say that driving on the right side of the road in\nEngland is \u201clawful\u201d under U. S. law, but that would be so\nonly because U. S. law has nothing to say about the sub\u00ad\nject. The governing law is English law, and English law\ndemands that driving be done on the left side of the road.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court asserts that my position gives the word \u201clawfully\u201d in\n\n\u00a7109(a) \u201clittle, if any, linguistic work to do.\u201d Ante, at 9. That is not so.\nMy reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase \u201clawfully made\n8            KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The logical implication of the Court\u2019s definition of the\nword \u201cunder\u201d is that any copy manufactured abroad\u2014even\na piratical one made without the copyright owner\u2019s author\u00ad\nization and in violation of the law of the country where it\nwas created\u2014would fall within the scope of \u00a7109(a). Any\nsuch copy would have been made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or\n\u201cin compliance with\u201d the U. S. Copyright Act, in the sense\nthat manufacturing the copy did not violate the Act (be\u00ad\ncause the Act does not apply extraterritorially).\n  The Court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd\nconclusion. Instead, it interprets \u00a7109(a) as applying only\nto copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or\nwould have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been ap\u00ad\nplicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United\nStates). See ante, at 8 (\u201c\u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u2018first sale\u2019 doctrine would\napply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture\nmet the requirements of American copyright law.\u201d). Con\u00ad\ngress, however, used express language when it called for\nsuch a counterfactual inquiry in 17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7602(a)(2)\nand (b). See \u00a7602(a)(2) (\u201cImportation into the United\nStates or exportation from the United States, without the\nauthority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\ncopies or phonorecords, the making of which either consti\u00ad\ntuted an infringement of copyright, or which would have\nconstituted an infringement of copyright if this title had\nbeen applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right\nto distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106.\u201d\n(emphasis added)); \u00a7602(b) (\u201cIn a case where the making\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunder this title.\u201d The word \u201cmade\u201d signifies that the conduct at issue is\nthe creation or manufacture of a copy.

United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,\n472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam); brackets in\noriginal)).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Attempting  to show that my reading of \u00a7109(a) is susceptible to the\nsame criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed \u201cmanufacturing\nclause,\u201d which required \u201ccopies of a work consisting preponderantly of\nnondramatic literary material . . . in the English language\u201d to be\n\u201cmanufactured in the United States or Canada.\u201d Copyright Act of 1976,\n\u00a7601(a), 90 Stat. 2588. Because Congress expressly referred to manu\u00ad\nfacturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d in \u00a7109(a) cannot mean \u201cmanufactured in the\nUnited States.\u201d Ante, at 19. This argument is a non sequitur. I do not\ncontend that the phrases \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d and \u201cmanu\u00ad\nfactured in the United States\u201d are interchangeable. To repeat, I read\nthe phrase \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d as referring to instances in\nwhich a copy\u2019s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance\nwith, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. See supra, at 6. Not all copies \u201cmanu\u00ad\nfactured in the United States\u201d will satisfy this standard. For example,\npiratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s authorization are not \u201clawfully made under [Title 17].\u201d\nNor would the phrase \u201clawfully manufactured in the United States\u201d be\nan exact substitute for \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d The making of\na copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provi\u00ad\nsion of law. Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright\nowner\u2019s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum\nwage. The copy would be \u201clawfully made under [Title 17]\u201d in the sense\nthat its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the\ncopy\u2019s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the viola\u00ad\n10           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Not only does the Court adopt an unnatural construc\u00ad\ntion of the \u00a7109(a) phrase \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d\nConcomitantly, the Court reduces \u00a7602(a)(1) to insignifi\u00ad\ncance. As the Court appears to acknowledge, see ante, at\n26, the only independent effect \u00a7602(a)(1) has under to\u00ad\nday\u2019s decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations\ncarried out by persons who merely have possession of, but\ndo not own, the imported copies. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a)\n(\u00a7109(a) applies to any \u201cowner of a particular copy or\nphonorecord lawfully made under this title\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).6 If this is enough to avoid rendering \u00a7602(a)(1)\nentirely \u201csuperfluous,\u201d ante, at 26, it hardly suffices to give\nthe owner\u2019s importation right the scope Congress intended\nit to have. Congress used broad language in \u00a7602(a)(1); it\ndid so to achieve a broad objective. Had Congress intended\nsimply to provide a copyright remedy against larcenous\nlessees, licensees, consignees, and bailees of films and\nother copyright-protected goods, see ante, at 13\u201314, 26, it\nlikely would have used language tailored to that narrow\npurpose. See 2 Nimmer \u00a78.12[B][6][c], at 8\u2013184.31, n. 432\n(\u201cIt may be wondered whether . . . potential causes of\naction [against licensees and the like] are more than theo\u00ad\nretical.\u201d). See also ante, at 2 (KAGAN, J., concurring) (the\nCourt\u2019s decision limits \u00a7602(a)(1) \u201cto a fairly esoteric set of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntion of the minimum-wage laws.\n   6 When \u00a7602(a)(1) was originally enacted in 1976, it played an addi\u00ad\n\ntional role\u2014providing a private cause of action against importers of\npiratical goods. See Quality King, 523 U. S., at 146. In 2008, however,\nCongress amended \u00a7602 to provide for such a cause of action in\n\u00a7602(a)(2), which prohibits the unauthorized \u201c[i]mportation into the\nUnited States . . . of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have consti\u00ad\ntuted an infringement of copyright if [Title 17] had been applicable.\u201d\nSee PROIPA, \u00a7105(b)(3), 122 Stat. 4259\u20134260. Thus, under the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation, the only conduct reached by \u00a7602(a)(1) but not\n\u00a7602(a)(2) is a nonowner\u2019s unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical\ncopy.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Instead, the primary purpose of \u00a7602(a)(1)\nwas to reach third-party importers, enterprising actors like Kirtsaeng,\nagainst whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to\nlack of privity. See Part III, infra.\n   8 Section 602(a)(3) provides:\n\n\u201cThis subsection [i.e., \u00a7602(a)] does not apply to\u2014\n   \u201c(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the\nauthority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of\nany State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or\nphonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work\nimported for purposes other than archival use;\n   \u201c(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or\nexporter and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more\nthan one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by\nany person arriving from outside the United States or departing from\nthe United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part\nof such person\u2019s personal baggage; or\n   \u201c(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly,\neducational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect\nto no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival\npurposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other\nwork for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation\nof such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of sys\u00ad\ntematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization\nin violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2).\u201d\n12           KIRTSAENG v.

For example,\nhad Congress conceived of \u00a7109(a)\u2019s sweep as the Court\ndoes, what earthly reason would there be to provide, as\nCongress did in \u00a7602(a)(3)(C), that a library may import\n\u201cno more than five copies\u201d of a non-audiovisual work for its\n\u201clending or archival purposes\u201d?\n   The far more plausible reading of \u00a7\u00a7109(a) and 602(a),\nthen, is that Congress intended \u00a7109(a) to apply to copies\nmade in the United States, not to copies manufactured\nand sold abroad. That reading of the first sale and impor\u00ad\ntation provisions leaves \u00a7602(a)(3)\u2019s exceptions with real,\nmeaningful work to do. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of statutory\nconstruction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sen\u00ad\ntence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the range of circum-\nstances covered by the exceptions, \u00a7602(a)(3) frees indi\u00ad\nviduals and entities who purchase foreign-made copies\nabroad from the requirement they would otherwise face\nunder \u00a7602(a)(1) of obtaining the copyright owner\u2019s per\u00ad\nmission to import the copies into the United States.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The term \u201cgray market good\u201d refers to a good that is \u201cimported out\u00ad\n\nside the distribution channels that have been contractually negotiated\nby the intellectual property owner.\u201d Forsyth & Rothnie, Parallel\nImports, in The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and\nCompetition Policy 429 (S. Anderman ed. 2007). Such goods are also\ncommonly called \u201cparallel imports.\u201d Ibid.\n  10 The Court asserts that its reading of \u00a7109(a) is bolstered by \u00a7104,\n\nwhich extends the copyright \u201cprotection[s]\u201d of Title 17 to a wide variety\nof foreign works. See ante, at 10\u201311. The \u201cprotection under this title\u201d\nafforded by \u00a7104, however, is merely protection against infringing\nconduct within the United States, the only place where Title 17 applies.\nSee 4 W.

Section\n602(a)(1) was enacted as part of the Copyright Act of 1976,\n90 Stat. 2589\u20132590. That Act was the product of a lengthy\nrevision effort overseen by the U. S. Copyright Office. See\nMills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U. S. 153, 159\u2013160 (1985).\nIn its initial 1961 report on recommended revisions, the\nCopyright Office noted that publishers had \u201csuggested\nthat the [then-existing] import ban on piratical copies\nshould be extended to bar the importation of . . . foreign\nedition[s]\u201d in violation of \u201cagreements to divide interna\u00ad\ntional markets for copyrighted works.\u201d Copyright Law\nRevision: Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 126 (H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1961) (herein\u00ad\nafter Copyright Law Revision). See Copyright Act of 1947,\n\u00a7106, 61 Stat. 663 (\u201cThe importation into the United\nStates . . . of any piratical copies of any work copyrighted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a7109(a) is consistent with Congress\u2019 use of that phrase in \u00a7104. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, \u00a7104 describes which works are entitled to copyright protec\u00ad\ntion under U. S. law. But no one disputes that Wiley\u2019s copyrights in the\nworks at issue in this case are valid. The only question is whether\nKirtsaeng\u2019s importation of copies of those works infringed Wiley\u2019s\ncopyrights. It is basic to copyright law that \u201c[o]wnership of a copyright\n. . . is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work\nis embodied.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7202. See also \u00a7101 (\u201c \u2018Copies\u2019 are material\nobjects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any\nmethod now known or later developed, and from which the work can be\nperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or\nwith the aid of a machine or device.\u201d). Given the distinction copyright\nlaw draws between works and copies, \u00a7104 is inapposite to the question\nhere presented. 4 Patry \u00a713:44.10, at 13\u2013129 (\u201cThere is no connection,\nlinguistically or substantively, between Section[s] 104 and 109: Section\n104 deals with national eligibility for the intangible work of authorship;\nSection 109(a) deals with the tangible, physical embodiment of the\nwork, the \u2018copy.\u2019 \u201d).\n14         KIRTSAENG v.

The Copyright\nOffice originally recommended against such an extension\nof the importation ban, reasoning that enforcement of\nterritorial restrictions was best left to contract law. Copy\u00ad\nright Law Revision 126.\n   Publishing-industry representatives argued strenuously\nagainst the position initially taken by the Copyright Of\u00ad\nfice. At a 1962 panel discussion on the Copyright Office\u2019s\nreport, for example, Horace Manges of the American Book\nPublishers Council stated:\n     \u201cWhen a U. S. book publisher enters into a contract\n     with a British publisher to acquire exclusive U. S.\n     rights for a particular book, he often finds that the\n     English edition . . . of that particular book finds its\n     way into this country. Now it\u2019s all right to say, \u2018Com\u00ad\n     mence a lawsuit for breach of contract.\u2019 But this is\n     expensive, burdensome, and, for the most part, inef\u00ad\n     fective.\u201d Copyright Law Revision Part 2: Discussion\n     and Comments on Report of the Register of Copy\u00ad\n     rights on the General Revision of the U.

This case bears on the highly con\u00ad\ntentious trade issue of interterritorial exhaustion. The\nissue arises because intellectual property law is territorial\nin nature, see supra, at 6, which means that creators of\nintellectual property \u201cmay hold a set of parallel\u201d intellec\u00ad\ntual property rights under the laws of different nations.\nChiappetta, The Desirability of Agreeing to Disagree: The\nWTO, TRIPS, International IPR Exhaustion and a Few\nOther Things, 21 Mich.

Another option is a rule of international\nexhaustion, under which the authorized distribution of a\nparticular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s distribution right everywhere with respect\nto that copy. See ibid. The European Union has adopted\nthe intermediate approach of regional exhaustion, under\nwhich the sale of a copy anywhere within the European\nEconomic Area exhausts the copyright owner\u2019s distribu\u00ad\ntion right throughout that region. See id., at 430, 445.\nSection 602(a)(1), in my view, ties the United States to a\nnational-exhaustion framework.

See Chiappetta\n360 (\u201c[r]easonable people making valid points can, and\ndo, reach conflicting conclusions\u201d regarding the desirability\nof international exhaustion). International exhaustion\nsubjects copyright-protected goods to competition from\nlower priced imports and, to that extent, benefits con-\nsumers. Correspondingly, copyright owners profit from a\nnational-exhaustion regime, which also enlarges the mon\u00ad\netary incentive to create new copyrightable works. See\nForsyth & Rothnie 432\u2013437 (surveying arguments for and\nagainst international exhaustion).\n   Weighing the competing policy concerns, our Govern\u00ad\nment reached the conclusion that widespread adoption of\nthe international-exhaustion framework would be incon\u00ad\nsistent with the long-term economic interests of the United\nStates.

At that time, no statutory provision\nexpressly codified the first sale doctrine. Instead, copy\u00ad\nright law merely provided that copyright owners had \u201cthe\nsole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing,\ncopying, executing, finishing, and vending\u201d their works.\nCopyright Act of 1891, \u00a71, 26 Stat. 1107.\n   In Bobbs-Merrill, the Court addressed the scope of the\nstatutory right to \u201cven[d].\u201d In granting that right, the\nCourt held, Congress did not intend to permit copyright\nowners \u201cto fasten . . . a restriction upon the subsequent\nalienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the\nowner had parted with the title to one who had acquired\nfull dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for\nit.\u201d 210 U. S., at 349\u2013350. \u201c[O]ne who has sold a copy\u00ad\nrighted article . . . without restriction,\u201d the Court ex\u00ad\nplained, \u201chas parted with all right to control the sale of it.\u201d\nId., at 350. Thus, \u201c[t]he purchaser of a book, once sold by\nauthority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again,\nalthough he could not publish a new edition of it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Under the logic of Bobbs-Merrill, the sale of a foreign\u00ad\nmanufactured copy in the United States carried out with\nthe copyright owner\u2019s authorization would exhaust the\ncopyright owner\u2019s right to \u201cvend\u201d that copy. The copy\ncould thenceforth be resold, lent out, or otherwise redis\u00ad\ntributed without further authorization from the copyright\nowner. Although \u00a7106(3) uses the word \u201cdistribute\u201d rather\nthan \u201cvend,\u201d there is no reason to think Congress intended\nthe word \u201cdistribute\u201d to bear a meaning different from the\nconstruction the Court gave to the word \u201cvend\u201d in Bobbs-\nMerrill. See ibid. (emphasizing that the question before\nthe Court was \u201cpurely [one] of statutory construction\u201d).19\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 It appears that the Copyright Act of 1976 omitted the word \u201cvend\u201d\n\nand introduced the word \u201cdistribute\u201d to avoid the \u201credundan[cy]\u201d\npresent in pre-1976 law.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThus, in accord with Bobbs-Merrill, the first authorized\ndistribution of a foreign-made copy in the United States\nexhausts the copyright owner\u2019s distribution right under\n\u00a7106(3). After such an authorized distribution, a library\nmay lend, or a used-book dealer may resell, the foreign\u00ad\nmade copy without seeking the copyright owner\u2019s permis\u00ad\nsion. Cf. ante, at 19\u201321.\n   For example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had\nimported into the United States and then sold the foreign\u00ad\nmade textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley\u2019s \u00a7106(3) dis\u00ad\ntribution right would have been exhausted under the\nrationale of Bobbs-Merrill. Purchasers of the textbooks\nwould thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished\nwithout first gaining a license from Wiley.\n   This line of reasoning, it must be acknowledged, signifi\u00ad\ncantly curtails the independent effect of \u00a7109(a). If, as I\nmaintain, the term \u201cdistribute\u201d in \u00a7106(3) incorporates the\nfirst sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then\n\u00a7109(a)\u2019s codification of that doctrine adds little to the\nregulatory regime.20 Section 109(a), however, does serve\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat the exclusive rights to \u201cpublish\u201d and \u201cvend\u201d works under the\nCopyright Act of 1947, \u00a71(a), 61 Stat. 652\u2013653, were \u201credundant\u201d).\n  20 My position that Bobbs-Merrill lives on as a limiting construction of\n\nthe \u00a7106(3) distribution right does not leave \u00a7109(a) with no work to do.\nThere can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were\npublished and first sold in the United States.

Congress first codified the first\nsale doctrine in \u00a741 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat.\n1084.21 It did so, the House Committee Report on the\n1909 Act explains, \u201cin order to make . . . clear that [Con\u00ad\ngress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the\nconstruction to be given to the word \u2018vend.\u2019 \u201d H. R. Rep.\nNo. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909). According to the\nCommittee Report, \u00a741 was \u201cnot intended to change [exist\u00ad\ning law] in any way.\u201d Ibid. The position I have stated and\nexplained accords with this expression of congressional\nintent. In enacting \u00a741 and its successors, I would hold,\nCongress did not \u201cchange . . . existing law,\u201d ibid., by strip\u00ad\nping the word \u201cvend\u201d (and thus its substitute \u201cdistribute\u201d)\nof the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.\n   In any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which\nI subscribe honors Congress\u2019 aim in enacting \u00a7109(a)\nwhile the Court\u2019s reading of the Act severely diminishes\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s role. See supra, at 10\u201312. My position in no\nway tugs against the principle underlying \u00a7109(a)\u2014i.e.,\nthat certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStates with the copyright owner\u2019s permission, not when it is distributed\nabroad. But under \u00a7109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any author\u00ad\nized distribution of a U. S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in\na foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner\u2019s distribution right\nunder \u00a7106(3). See 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14. Section 109(a) therefore\nprovides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.\n   21 Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: \u201c[N]othing in this Act shall be\n\ndeemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a\ncopyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.\u201d\n35 Stat. 1084. This language was repeated without material change in\n\u00a727 of the Copyright Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 660. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 2, 17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a) sets out the current codification of the\nfirst sale doctrine.\n28           KIRTSAENG v.

See Brief for American Library Association\net al. 20. The United States maintains, and I agree, however, that\n\u00a7602(a)(3)(C) \u201cis fairly (and best) read as implicitly authorizing lending,\nin addition to importation, of all works other than audiovisual works.\u201d\nBrief for United States as Amicus Curiae 30, n. 6.\n  23 Title 17 U.

Because \u00a7109(c), like\n\u00a7109(a), applies only to copies \u201clawfully made under this\ntitle,\u201d amici contend that a ruling in Wiley\u2019s favor would\nprevent museums from invoking \u00a7109(c) with respect to\nforeign-made works of art. Id., at 11\u201313.24\n   Limiting \u00a7109(c) to U. S.-made works, however, does not\nbar art museums from lawfully displaying works made in\nother countries. Museums can, of course, seek the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s permission to display a work. Furthermore,\nthe sale of a work of art to a U.

See 2\nPatry \u00a75:131, at 5\u2013280 (\u201c[C]ourts have noted the potential\navailability of an implied nonexclusive licens[e] when the\ncircumstances . . . demonstrate that the parties intended\nthat the work would be used for a specific purpose.\u201d).\nDisplaying a work of art as part of a museum exhibition\nmight also qualify as a \u201cfair use\u201d under 17 U.

Three decades have passed since a\nfederal court first published an opinion reading \u00a7109(a) as\napplicable exclusively to copies made in the United States.\nSee Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

Yet\nKirtsaeng and his supporting amici cite not a single case\nin which the owner of a consumer good authorized for sale\nin the United States has been sued for copyright infringe\u00ad\nment after reselling the item or giving it away as a gift or\nto charity. The absence of such lawsuits is unsurprising.\nRoutinely suing one\u2019s customers is hardly a best business\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 Principlesof fair use and implied license may also allow a U.

Manufacturers may also insist that soft-\nware programmers agree to contract terms barring such\nlawsuits.\n  The Court provides a different explanation for the\nabsence of the untoward consequences predicted in its\nopinion\u2014namely, that lower court decisions regarding the\nscope of \u00a7109(a)\u2019s first sale prescription have not been\nuniform. Ante, at 23. Uncertainty generated by these\nconflicting decisions, the Court notes, may have deterred\nsome copyright owners from pressing infringement claims.\nAnte, at 23\u201324. But if, as the Court suggests, there are a\nmultitude of copyright owners champing at the bit to bring\nlawsuits against libraries, art museums, and consumers in\nan effort to exercise perpetual control over the down\u00ad\nstream distribution and public display of foreign-made\ncopies, might one not expect that at least a handful of such\nlawsuits would have been filed over the past 30 years?\nThe absence of such suits indicates that the \u201cpractical\nproblems\u201d hypothesized by the Court are greatly exagger\u00ad\nated. Ante, at 24.27 They surely do not warrant disregard\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 Exerting extensive control over secondary markets may not always\n\nbe in a manufacturer\u2019s best interest. Carmakers, for example, often\ntrumpet the resale value of their vehicles. See, e.g., Nolan, UD grad\nleads Cadillac marketing, Dayton Daily News, Apr. 2, 2009, p. A8\n(\u201cCadillac plays up its warranty coverage and reliable resale value to\nprospective customers.\u201d). If the transaction costs of reselling vehicles\nwere to rise, consumers\u2019 perception of a new car\u2019s value, and thus the\nprice they are willing to pay for such a car, might fall\u2014an outcome\nhardly favorable to automobile manufacturers.\n  27 It should not be overlooked that the ability to prevent importation\n\nof foreign-made copies encourages copyright owners such as Wiley to\noffer copies of their works at reduced prices to consumers in less devel\u00ad\noped countries who might otherwise be unable to afford them. The\nCourt\u2019s holding, however, prevents copyright owners from barring the\nimportation of such low-priced copies into the United States, where\nthey will compete with the higher priced editions copyright owners\n32          KIRTSAENG v.

Cf. Hartford Under-\nwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U.

First, in enacting \u00a7602(a)(1), Con-\ngress intended to grant copyright owners permission to\nsegment international markets by barring the importation\nof foreign-made copies into the United States. Second, as\ncodification of the first sale doctrine underscores, Congress\ndid not want the exclusive distribution right conferred in\n\u00a7106(3) to be boundless. Instead of harmonizing these\nobjectives, the Court subordinates the first entirely to the\nsecond. It is unsurprising that none of the three major\ntreatises on U. S. copyright law embrace the Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nstruction of \u00a7109(a). See 2 Nimmer \u00a78.12[B][6][c], at\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmake available for sale in this country.

See \u00a7602(a)(1). In Quality King\n  Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research Int\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145,\n  this Court held that \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s reference to \u00a7106(3) incorporates the\n  \u00a7\u00a7107 through 122 limitations, including \u00a7109\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine.\n  However, the copy in Quality King was initially manufactured in the\n  United States and then sent abroad and sold.\n      Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., an academic textbook pub-\n  lisher, often assigns to its wholly owned foreign subsidiary (Wiley\n  Asia) rights to publish, print, and sell foreign editions of Wiley\u2019s Eng-\n  lish language textbooks abroad. Wiley Asia\u2019s books state that they\n  are not to be taken (without permission) into the United States.\n  When petitioner Kirtsaeng moved from Thailand to the United States\n  to study mathematics, he asked friends and family to buy foreign edi-\n  tion English-language textbooks in Thai book shops, where they sold\n  at low prices, and to mail them to him in the United States. He then\n  sold the books, reimbursed his family and friends, and kept the\n  profit.\n      Wiley filed suit, claiming that Kirtsaeng\u2019s unauthorized importa-\n  tion and resale of its books was an infringement of Wiley\u2019s \u00a7106(3)\n2             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    exclusive right to distribute and \u00a7602\u2019s import prohibition. Kirtsaeng\n    replied that because his books were \u201clawfully made\u201d and acquired le-\n    gitimately, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine permitted importation and\n    resale without Wiley\u2019s further permission. The District Court held\n    that Kirtsaeng could not assert this defense because the doctrine\n    does not apply to goods manufactured abroad. The jury then found\n    that Kirtsaeng had willfully infringed Wiley\u2019s American copyrights\n    and assessed damages. The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that\n    \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d language indicated that the\n    \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine does not apply to copies of American copyrighted\n    works manufactured abroad.\nHeld: The \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work\n lawfully made abroad. Pp. 7\u201333.\n    (a) Wiley reads \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d to impose a geo-\n graphical limitation that prevents \u00a7109(a)\u2019s doctrine from applying to\n Wiley Asia\u2019s books. Kirtsaeng, however, reads the phrase as impos-\n ing the non-geographical limitation made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or \u201cin\n compliance with\u201d the Copyright Act, which would permit the doctrine\n to apply to copies manufactured abroad with the copyright owner\u2019s\n permission. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Section 109(a)\u2019s language, its context, and the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doc-\n trine\u2019s common-law history favor Kirtsaeng\u2019s reading. Pp. 8\u201324.\n      (1) Section 109(a) says nothing about geography. \u201cUnder\u201d can\n logically mean \u201cin accordance with.\u201d And a nongeographical inter-\n pretation provides each word in the phrase \u201clawfully made under this\n title\u201d with a distinct purpose: \u201clawfully made\u201d suggests an effort to\n distinguish copies that were made lawfully from those that were not,\n and \u201cunder this title\u201d sets forth the standard of \u201clawful[ness]\u201d (i.e.,\n the U. S. Copyright Act). This simple reading promotes the tradi-\n tional copyright objective of combatting piracy and makes word-by-\n word linguistic sense.\n    In contrast, the geographical interpretation bristles with linguistic\n difficulties. Wiley first reads \u201cunder\u201d to mean \u201cin conformance with\n the Copyright Act where the Copyright Act is applicable.\u201d Wiley then\n argues that the Act \u201cis applicable\u201d only in the United States. Howev-\n er, neither \u201cunder\u201d nor any other word in \u201clawfully made under this\n title\u201d means \u201cwhere.\u201d Nor can a geographical limitation be read into\n the word \u201capplicable.\u201d The fact that the Act does not instantly pro-\n tect an American copyright holder from unauthorized piracy taking\n place abroad does not mean the Act is inapplicable to copies made\n abroad. Indeed, \u00a7602(a)(2) makes foreign-printed pirated copies sub-\n ject to the Copyright Act. And \u00a7104 says that works \u201csubject to pro-\n tection\u201d include unpublished works \u201cwithout regard to the [author\u2019s]\n nationality or domicile,\u201d and works \u201cfirst published\u201d in any of the\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

Pp. 8\u201312.\n     (2) Both historical and contemporary statutory context indicate\nthat Congress did not have geography in mind when writing the pre-\nsent version of \u00a7109(a). A comparison of the language in \u00a7109(a)\u2019s\npredecessor and the present provision supports this conclusion. The\nformer version referred to those who are not owners of a copy, but\nmere possessors who \u201clawfully obtained\u201d a copy, while the present\nversion covers only owners of a \u201clawfully made\u201d copy. This new lan-\nguage, including the five words at issue, makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection but one who owns a copy\nwill be protected, provided that the copy was \u201clawfully made.\u201d A\nnongeographical interpretation is also supported by other provisions\nof the present statute. For example, the \u201cmanufacturing clause,\u201d\nwhich limited importation of many copies printed outside the United\nStates, was phased out in an effort to equalize treatment of copies\nmade in America and copies made abroad. But that \u201cequal treat-\nment\u201d principle is difficult to square with a geographical interpreta-\ntion that would grant an American copyright holder permanent con-\ntrol over the American distribution chain in respect to copies printed\nabroad but not those printed in America. Finally, the Court normally\npresumes that the words \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d carry the\nsame meaning when they appear in different but related sections,\nand it is unlikely that Congress would have intended the conse-\nquences produced by a geographical interpretation. Pp. 12\u201316.\n     (3) A nongeographical reading is also supported by the canon of\nstatutory interpretation that \u201cwhen a statute covers an issue previ-\nously governed by the common law,\u201d it is presumed that \u201cCongress\nintended to retain the substance of the common law.\u201d Samantar v.\nYousuf, 560 U. S. ___, ___. The common-law \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine,\nwhich has an impeccable historic pedigree, makes no geographical\ndistinctions. Nor can such distinctions be found in Bobbs-Merrill Co.\nv. Straus, 210 U. S. 339, where this Court first applied the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine, or in \u00a7109(a)\u2019s predecessor provision, which Congress enact-\ned a year later. Pp. 17\u201319.\n     (4) Library associations, used-book dealers, technology compa-\nnies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point to various ways\nin which a geographical interpretation would fail to further basic\nconstitutional copyright objectives, in particular \u201cpromot[ing] the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts,\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. For example, a\ngeographical interpretation of the first-sale doctrine would likely re-\nquire libraries to obtain permission before circulating the many books\nin their collections that were printed overseas. Wiley counters that\nsuch problems have not occurred in the 30 years since a federal court\n4             KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    first adopted a geographical interpretation. But the law has not been\n    settled for so long in Wiley\u2019s favor. The Second Circuit in this case\n    was the first Court of Appeals to adopt a purely geographical inter-\n    pretation. Reliance on the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine is also deeply embed-\n    ded in the practices of booksellers, libraries, museums, and retailers,\n    who have long relied on its protection. And the fact that harm has\n    proved limited so far may simply reflect the reluctance of copyright\n    holders to assert geographically based resale rights. Thus, the prac-\n    tical problems described by petitioner and his amici are too serious,\n    extensive, and likely to come about to be dismissed as insignificant\u2014\n    particularly in light of the ever-growing importance of foreign trade\n    to America.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 19, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Section 106 of the Copyright Act grants \u201cthe owner of\ncopyright under this title\u201d certain \u201cexclusive rights,\u201d\nincluding the right \u201cto distribute copies . . . of the copy\u00ad\nrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of\nownership.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7106(3). These rights are quali\u00ad\nfied, however, by the application of various limitations set\nforth in the next several sections of the Act, \u00a7\u00a7107 through\n122. Those sections, typically entitled \u201cLimitations on\nexclusive rights,\u201d include, for example, the principle of\n\u201cfair use\u201d (\u00a7107), permission for limited library archival\nreproduction, (\u00a7108), and the doctrine at issue here, the\n\u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine (\u00a7109).\n   Section 109(a) sets forth the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine as\nfollows:\n    \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3) [the\n    section that grants the owner exclusive distribution\n    rights], the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord\n    lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled, without\n    the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or other\u00ad\n    wise dispose of the possession of that copy or\n2          KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    phonorecord.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThus, even though \u00a7106(3) forbids distribution of a copy of,\nsay, the copyrighted novel Herzog without the copyright\nowner\u2019s permission, \u00a7109(a) adds that, once a copy of Her-\nzog has been lawfully sold (or its ownership otherwise\nlawfully transferred), the buyer of that copy and subse\u00ad\nquent owners are free to dispose of it as they wish. In\ncopyright jargon, the \u201cfirst sale\u201d has \u201cexhausted\u201d the\ncopyright owner\u2019s \u00a7106(3) exclusive distribution right.\n   What, however, if the copy of Herzog was printed abroad\nand then initially sold with the copyright owner\u2019s permis\u00ad\nsion? Does the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine still apply? Is the\nbuyer, like the buyer of a domestically manufactured copy,\nfree to bring the copy into the United States and dispose of\nit as he or she wishes?\n   To put the matter technically, an \u201cimportation\u201d provi\u00ad\nsion, \u00a7602(a)(1), says that\n    \u201c[i]mportation into the United States, without the au\u00ad\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies . . . of a work that have been acquired outside\n    the United States is an infringement of the exclusive\n    right to distribute copies . . . under section 106 . . . .\u201d\n    17 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis\n    added).\n   Thus \u00a7602(a)(1) makes clear that importing a copy\nwithout permission violates the owner\u2019s exclusive distri-\nbution right. But in doing so, \u00a7602(a)(1) refers explicitly to\nthe \u00a7106(3) exclusive distribution right. As we have just\nsaid, \u00a7106 is by its terms \u201c[s]ubject to\u201d the various doc\u00ad\ntrines and principles contained in \u00a7\u00a7107 through 122, in-\ncluding \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d limitation. Do those same\nmodifications apply\u2014in particular, does the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\nmodification apply\u2014when considering whether \u00a7602(a)(1)\nprohibits importing a copy?\n   In Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135, 145 (1998), we held that\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s reference to \u00a7106(3)\u2019s exclusive distribution\nright incorporates the later subsections\u2019 limitations, in\u00ad\ncluding, in particular, the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine of \u00a7109.\nThus, it might seem that, \u00a7602(a)(1) notwithstanding, one\nwho buys a copy abroad can freely import that copy into\nthe United States and dispose of it, just as he could had he\nbought the copy in the United States.\n  But Quality King considered an instance in which the\ncopy, though purchased abroad, was initially manufac\u00ad\ntured in the United States (and then sent abroad and\nsold). This case is like Quality King but for one important\nfact. The copies at issue here were manufactured abroad.\nThat fact is important because \u00a7109(a) says that the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine applies to \u201ca particular copy or phonorecord\nlawfully made under this title.\u201d And we must decide here\nwhether the five words, \u201clawfully made under this title,\u201d\nmake a critical legal difference.\n  Putting section numbers to the side, we ask whether\nthe \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to protect a buyer or other\nlawful owner of a copy (of a copyrighted work) lawfully\nmanufactured abroad. Can that buyer bring that copy\ninto the United States (and sell it or give it away) without\nobtaining permission to do so from the copyright owner?\nCan, for example, someone who purchases, say at a used\nbookstore, a book printed abroad subsequently resell it\nwithout the copyright owner\u2019s permission?\n  In our view, the answers to these questions are, yes. We\nhold that the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine applies to copies of a\ncopyrighted work lawfully made abroad.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  Respondent, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., publishes aca-\ndemic textbooks.

In that case, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine\nwould apply to copyrighted works as long as their manu\u00ad\nfacture met the requirements of American copyright law.\nIn particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here,\ncopies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the\ncopyright owner. See \u00a7106 (referring to the owner\u2019s right\nto authorize).\n   In our view, \u00a7109(a)\u2019s language, its context, and the\ncommon-law history of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine, taken\ntogether, favor a non-geographical interpretation. We also\ndoubt that Congress would have intended to create the\npractical copyright-related harms with which a geograph\u00ad\nical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,\nartistic, commercial, and consumer activities. See Part II\u2013\nD, infra. We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng\u2019s\nnongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.\n                            A\n  The language of \u00a7109(a) read literally favors Kirtsaeng\u2019s\nnongeographical interpretation, namely, that \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d means made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or\n\u201cin compliance with\u201d the Copyright Act. The language of\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7109(a) says nothing about geography. The word \u201cunder\u201d\ncan mean \u201c[i]n accordance with.\u201d 18 Oxford English Dic\u00ad\ntionary 950 (2d ed. 1989). See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\n1525 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201caccording to\u201d). And a nongeograph\u00ad\nical interpretation provides each word of the five-word\nphrase with a distinct purpose. The first two words of the\nphrase, \u201clawfully made,\u201d suggest an effort to distinguish\nthose copies that were made lawfully from those that were\nnot, and the last three words, \u201cunder this title,\u201d set forth\nthe standard of \u201clawful[ness].\u201d Thus, the nongeograph-\nical reading is simple, it promotes a traditional copyright\nobjective (combatting piracy), and it makes word-by-word\nlinguistic sense.\n   The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with\nlinguistic difficulties. It gives the word \u201clawfully\u201d little,\nif any, linguistic work to do. (How could a book be unlaw\u00ad\nfully \u201cmade under this title\u201d?) It imports geography into a\nstatutory provision that says nothing explicitly about it.\nAnd it is far more complex than may at first appear.\n   To read the clause geographically, Wiley, like the Sec\u00ad\nond Circuit and the Solicitor General, must first empha\u00ad\nsize the word \u201cunder.\u201d Indeed, Wiley reads \u201cunder this\ntitle\u201d to mean \u201cin conformance with the Copyright Act\nwhere the Copyright Act is applicable.\u201d Brief for Respond\u00ad\nent 15. Wiley must then take a second step, arguing that\nthe Act \u201cis applicable\u201d only in the United States. Ibid.\nAnd the Solicitor General must do the same. See Brief for\nUnited States 6 (\u201cA copy is \u2018lawfully made under this title\u2019\nif Title 17 governs the copy\u2019s creation and the copy is made\nin compliance with Title 17\u2019s requirements\u201d). See also\npost, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (\u201cunder\u201d describes\nsomething \u201cgoverned or regulated by another\u201d).\n    One difficulty is that neither \u201cunder\u201d nor any other\nword in the phrase means \u201cwhere.\u201d See, e.g., 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary, supra, at 947\u2013952 (definition of \u201cun\u00ad\nder\u201d). It might mean \u201csubject to,\u201d see post, at 6, but as this\n10        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt has repeatedly acknowledged, the word evades a\nuniform, consistent meaning. See Kucana v. Holder, 558\nU. S. 233, 245 (2010) (\u201c \u2018under\u2019 is chameleon\u201d); Ardestani v.\nINS, 502 U.

Where, precisely, is the\nCopyright Act \u201capplicable\u201d? The Act does not instantly\nprotect an American copyright holder from unauthorized\npiracy taking place abroad. But that fact does not mean\nthe Act is inapplicable to copies made abroad. As a matter\nof ordinary English, one can say that a statute imposing,\nsay, a tariff upon \u201cany rhododendron grown in Nepal\u201d\napplies to all Nepalese rhododendrons. And, similarly,\none can say that the American Copyright Act is applicable\nto all pirated copies, including those printed overseas.\nIndeed, the Act itself makes clear that (in the Solicitor\nGeneral\u2019s language) foreign-printed pirated copies are \u201csub\u00ad\nject to\u201d the Act. \u00a7602(a)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. V) (refer-\nring to importation of copies \u201cthe making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would\nhave constituted an infringement of copyright if this title\nhad been applicable\u201d); Brief for United States 5. See also\npost, at 6 (suggesting that \u201cmade under\u201d may be read as\n\u201csubject to\u201d).\n   The appropriateness of this linguistic usage is under\u00ad\nscored by the fact that \u00a7104 of the Act itself says that\nworks \u201csubject to protection under this title\u201d include un\u00ad\npublished works \u201cwithout regard to the nationality or\ndomicile of the author,\u201d and works \u201cfirst published\u201d in any\none of the nearly 180 nations that have signed a copyright\ntreaty with the United States. \u00a7\u00a7104(a), (b) (2006 ed.)\n(emphasis added); \u00a7101 (2006 ed., Supp. V) (defining\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

Copyright Office, Circular No. 38A,\nInternational Copyright Relations of the United States\n(2010). Thus, ordinary English permits us to say that the\nAct \u201capplies\u201d to an Irish manuscript lying in its author\u2019s\nDublin desk drawer as well as to an original recording of\na ballet performance first made in Japan and now on\ndisplay in a Kyoto art gallery.

As we said, that Cir\u00ad\ncuit interprets the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine to cover both (1)\ncopies manufactured in the United States and (2) copies\nmanufactured abroad but first sold in the United States\nwith the American copyright owner\u2019s permission. Den\u00ad\nbicare U. S. A., 84 F. 3d, at 1149\u20131150.

As we shall later describe, see Part II\u2013D, infra,\nwithout some such qualification a copyright holder could\nprevent a buyer from domestically reselling or even giving\naway copies of a video game made in Japan, a film made\nin Germany, or a dress (with a design copyright) made in\nChina, even if the copyright holder has granted permission\nfor the foreign manufacture, importation, and an initial\n12         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndomestic sale of the copy. A publisher such as Wiley\nwould be free to print its books abroad, allow their im-\nportation and sale within the United States, but prohibit\nstudents from later selling their used texts at a campus\nbookstore. We see no way, however, to reconcile this half\u00ad\ngeographical/half-nongeographical interpretation with the\nlanguage of the phrase, \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d\nAs a matter of English, it would seem that those five\nwords either do cover copies lawfully made abroad or they\ndo not.\n   In sum, we believe that geographical interpretations\ncreate more linguistic problems than they resolve. And\nconsiderations of simplicity and coherence tip the purely\nlinguistic balance in Kirtsaeng\u2019s, nongeographical, favor.\n                           B\n  Both historical and contemporary statutory context in\u00ad\ndicate that Congress, when writing the present version of\n\u00a7109(a), did not have geography in mind. In respect to\nhistory, we compare \u00a7109(a)\u2019s present language with the\nlanguage of its immediate predecessor. That predecessor\nsaid:\n     \u201c[N]othing in this Act shall be deemed to forbid, pre\u00ad\n     vent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a copy\u00ad\n     righted work the possession of which has been lawfully\n     obtained.\u201d Copyright Act of 1909, \u00a741, 35 Stat. 1084\n     (emphasis added).\n  See also Copyright Act of 1947, \u00a727, 61 Stat. 660. The\npredecessor says nothing about geography (and Wiley does\nnot argue that it does). So we ask whether Congress, in\nchanging its language implicitly introduced a geograph-\nical limitation that previously was lacking. See also Part\nII\u2013C, infra (discussing 1909 codification of common-law\nprinciple).\n  A comparison of language indicates that it did not. The\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npredecessor says that the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine protects \u201cthe\ntransfer of any copy the possession of which has been\nlawfully obtained.\u201d The present version says that \u201cthe\nowner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\nunder this title is entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of\nthe possession of that copy or phonorecord.\u201d What does\nthis change in language accomplish?\n   The language of the former version referred to those\nwho are not owners of a copy, but mere possessors who\n\u201clawfully obtained\u201d a copy. The present version covers\nonly those who are owners of a \u201clawfully made\u201d copy.\nWhom does the change leave out? Who might have law-\nfully obtained a copy of a copyrighted work but not owned\nthat copy? One answer is owners of movie theaters, who\nduring the 1970\u2019s (and before) often leased films from\nmovie distributors or filmmakers.         See S. Donahue,\nAmerican Film Distribution 134, 177 (1987) (describing\nproducer-distributer and distributer-exhibitor agreements);\nNote, The Relationship Between Motion Picture Distribu\u00ad\ntion and Exhibition: An Analysis of the Effects of Anti-\nBlind Bidding Legislation, 9 Comm/Ent. L. J. 131, 135\n(1986). Because the theater owners had \u201clawfully ob\u00ad\ntained\u201d their copies, the earlier version could be read as\nallowing them to sell that copy, i.e., it might have given\nthem \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection. Because the theater owners\nwere lessees, not owners, of their copies, the change in\nlanguage makes clear that they (like bailees and other\nlessees) cannot take advantage of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine.\n(Those who find legislative history useful will find confir\u00ad\nmation in, e.g., House Committee on the Judiciary, Copy\u00ad\nright Law Revision, Supplementary Report of the Register\nof Copyrights on the General Revision of the U. S. Copy\u00ad\nright Law: 1965 Revision Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt.\n6, p. 30 (Comm.

Republic Graphics, Inc.,\n315 F. 2d 847, 851 (CA2 1963) (Friendly, J.) (pointing out\npredecessor statute\u2019s leasing problem)).\n    This objective perfectly well explains the new language\nof the present version, including the five words here at\nissue. Section 109(a) now makes clear that a lessee of\na copy will not receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection but one who\nowns a copy will receive \u201cfirst sale\u201d protection, provided, of\ncourse, that the copy was \u201clawfully made\u201d and not pi-\nrated. The new language also takes into account that a\ncopy may be \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d when the copy,\nsay of a phonorecord, comes into its owner\u2019s possession\nthrough use of a compulsory license, which \u201cthis title\u201d\nprovides for elsewhere, namely, in \u00a7115. Again, for those\nwho find legislative history useful, the relevant legislative\nreport makes this clear. H. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131476, p. 79\n(1976) (\u201cFor example, any resale of an illegally \u2018pirated\u2019\nphonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition\nof a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory li\u00ad\ncensing provisions of section 115 would not\u201d).\n    Other provisions of the present statute also support\na nongeographical interpretation. For one thing, the stat\u00ad\nute phases out the \u201cmanufacturing clause,\u201d a clause that\nappeared in earlier statutes and had limited importation\nof many copies (of copyrighted works) printed outside the\nUnited States. \u00a7601, 90 Stat. 2588 (\u201cPrior to July 1, 1982\n. . . the importation into or public distribution in the\nUnited States of copies of a work consisting preponderantly\nof nondramatic literary material . . . is prohibited unless\nthe portions consisting of such material have been manufac-\ntured in the United States or Canada\u201d). The phasing out\nof this clause sought to equalize treatment of copies manu\u00ad\nfactured in America and copies manufactured abroad. See\nH. R. Rep. No. 94\u20131476, at 165\u2013166.\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   The \u201cequal treatment\u201d principle, however, is difficult\nto square with a geographical interpretation of the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d clause that would grant the holder of an American\ncopyright (perhaps a foreign national, see supra, at 10)\npermanent control over the American distribution chain\n(sales, resales, gifts, and other distribution) in respect to\ncopies printed abroad but not in respect to copies printed\nin America. And it is particularly difficult to believe that\nCongress would have sought this unequal treatment while\nsaying nothing about it and while, in a related clause (the\nmanufacturing phase-out), seeking the opposite kind of\npolicy goal. Cf. Golan v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 30) (Congress has moved from a copyright\nregime that, prior to 1891, entirely excluded foreign works\nfrom U. S. copyright protection to a regime that now \u201cen\u00ad\nsure[s] that most works, whether foreign or domestic,\nwould be governed by the same legal regime\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Finally, we normally presume that the words \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d carry the same meaning when they\nappear in different but related sections. Department of\nRevenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S. 332,\n342 (1994). But doing so here produces surprising conse\u00ad\nquences.

To interpret these words\n  geographically would mean that one who buys a copy\u00ad\n  righted work of art, a poster, or even a bumper sticker,\n  in Canada, in Europe, in Asia, could not display\n  it in America without the copyright owner\u2019s further\n  authorization.\n16           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n     (2) Section 109(e) specifically provides that the owner\n     of a particular copy of a copyrighted video arcade game\n     \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d may \u201cpublicly perform\n     or display that game in coin-operated equipment\u201d with\u00ad\n     out the authorization of the copyright owner. To inter\u00ad\n     pret these words geographically means that an arcade\n     owner could not (\u201cwithout the authority of the copyright\n     owner\u201d) perform or display arcade games (whether new\n     or used) originally made in Japan. Cf. Red Baron-\n     Franklin Park, Inc. v.

American law too has generally thought that com\u00ad\npetition, including freedom to resell, can work to the ad\u00ad\nvantage of the consumer. See, e.g., Leegin Creative Leather\nProducts, Inc. v.

And we can find no language, context,\npurpose, or history that would rebut a \u201cstraightforward\napplication\u201d of that doctrine here.\n   The dissent argues that another principle of statutory\ninterpretation works against our reading, and points out\nthat elsewhere in the statute Congress used different\nwords to express something like the non-geographical\nreading we adopt.

Hence, Con\u00ad\ngress, the dissent believes, must have meant \u00a7109(a)\u2019s\ndifferent language to mean something different (such as\nthe dissent\u2019s own geographical interpretation of \u00a7109(a)).\nWe are not aware, however, of any canon of interpretation\nthat forbids interpreting different words used in different\nparts of the same statute to mean roughly the same thing.\nRegardless, were there such a canon, the dissent\u2019s inter\u00ad\npretation of \u00a7109(a) would also violate it. That is because\nCongress elsewhere in the 1976 Act included the words\n\u201cmanufactured in the United States or Canada,\u201d 90 Stat.\n2588, which express just about the same geographical\nthought that the dissent reads into \u00a7109(a)\u2019s very different\nlanguage.\n                              D\n   Associations of libraries, used-book dealers, technology\ncompanies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums point\nto various ways in which a geographical interpretation\nwould fail to further basic constitutional copyright objec\u00ad\ntives, in particular \u201cpromot[ing] the Progress of Science\nand useful Arts.\u201d U.

See\nsupra, at 10 (describing how \u00a7104 often makes such works\n\u201csubject to\u201d American copyright protection). A geograph\u00ad\nical interpretation, they say, would require the museums\nto obtain permission from the copyright owners before\nthey could display the work, see supra, at 15\u2014even if the\ncopyright owner has already sold or donated the work to\na foreign museum.

See also post, at 30\u201331.\n   We are less sanguine. For one thing, the law has not\nbeen settled for long in Wiley\u2019s favor. The Second Circuit,\nin its decision below, is the first Court of Appeals to adopt\na purely geographical interpretation. The Third Circuit\nhas favored a nongeographical interpretation. Sebastian\nInt\u2019l, 847 F. 2d 1093. The Ninth Circuit has favored a\nmodified geographical interpretation with a nongeograph\u00ad\nical (but textually unsustainable) corollary designed to\ndiminish the problem. Denbicare U. S.

Museums, for example, are\nnot in the habit of asking their foreign counterparts to\ncheck with the heirs of copyright owners before sending,\ne.g., a Picasso on tour. Brief for Association of Art Mu\u00ad\nseum Directors 11\u201312. That inertia means a dramatic\nchange is likely necessary before these institutions, in\u00ad\nstructed by their counsel, would begin to engage in the\ncomplex permission-verifying process that a geographical\ninterpretation would demand. And this Court\u2019s adoption\nof the geographical interpretation could provide that\ndramatic change. These intolerable consequences (along\nwith the absurd result that the copyright owner can ex-\nercise downstream control even when it authorized the\nimport or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth\nCircuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to\n24        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nadopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to\nmitigate these harms. Brief for United States 27\u201328;\npost, at 24\u201328. But those readings are not defensible, for\nthey require too many unprecedented jumps over linguis\u00ad\ntic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.\nSee, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of\n\u00a7106(3) \u201csignificantly curtails the independent effect of\n\u00a7109(a)\u201d).\n   Finally, the fact that harm has proved limited so far\nmay simply reflect the reluctance of copyright holders so\nfar to assert geographically based resale rights. They may\ndecide differently if the law is clarified in their favor.\nRegardless, a copyright law that can work in practice only\nif unenforced is not a sound copyright law. It is a law that\nwould create uncertainty, would bring about selective\nenforcement, and, if widely unenforced, would breed disre\u00ad\nspect for copyright law itself.\n   Thus, we believe that the practical problems that peti\u00ad\ntioner and his amici have described are too serious, too\nextensive, and too likely to come about for us to dismiss\nthem as insignificant\u2014particularly in light of the ever\u00ad\ngrowing importance of foreign trade to America. See\nThe World Bank, Imports of goods and services (% of\nGDP) (imports in 2011 18% of U.

(as visited\nMar. 15, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\nThe upshot is that copyright-related consequences along\nwith language, context, and interpretive canons argue\nstrongly against a geographical interpretation of \u00a7109(a).\n                            III\n  Wiley and the dissent make several additional impor\u00ad\ntant arguments in favor of the geographical interpretation.\nFirst, they say that our Quality King decision strongly\nsupports its geographical interpretation. In that case\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwe asked whether the Act\u2019s \u201cimportation provision,\u201d now\n\u00a7602(a)(1) (then \u00a7602(a)), barred importation (without\npermission) of a copyrighted item (labels affixed to hair\ncare products) where an American copyright owner au\u00ad\nthorized the first sale and export of hair care products\nwith copyrighted labels made in the United States, and\nwhere a buyer sought to import them back into the United\nStates without the copyright owner\u2019s permission. 523\nU. S., at 138\u2013139.\n  We held that the importation provision did not prohibit\nsending the products back into the United States (without\nthe copyright owner\u2019s permission). That section says:\n    \u201cImportation into the United States, without the au\u00ad\n    thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n    copies or phonorecords of a work that have been\n    acquired outside the United States is an infringement\n    of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phono\u00ad\n    records under section 106.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(1)\n    (2006 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added). See also\n    \u00a7602(a) (1994 ed.).\n   We pointed out that this section makes importation an\ninfringement of the \u201cexclusive right to distribute . . . under\n106.\u201d We noted that \u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine limits\nthe scope of the \u00a7106 exclusive distribution right. We took\nas given the fact that the products at issue had at least\nonce been sold. And we held that consequently, importa\u00ad\ntion of the copyrighted labels does not violate \u00a7602(a)(1).\n523 U. S., at 145.\n   In reaching this conclusion we endorsed Bobbs-Merrill\nand its statement that the copyright laws were not \u201cin\u00ad\ntended to create a right which would permit the holder of\nthe copyright to fasten, by notice in a book . . . a restriction\nupon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of\ncopyright after the owner had parted with the title to one\nwho had acquired full dominion over it.\u201d 210 U. S., at\n26        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n349\u2013350.\n   We also explained why we rejected the claim that our\ninterpretation would make \u00a7602(a)(1) pointless. Those\nadvancing that claim had pointed out that the 1976 Copy\u00ad\nright Act amendments retained a prior anti-piracy provi\u00ad\nsion, prohibiting the importation of pirated copies. Qual\u00ad\nity King, supra, at 146. Thus, they said, \u00a7602(a)(1) must\nprohibit the importation of lawfully made copies, for to\nallow the importation of those lawfully made copies after a\nfirst sale, as Quality King\u2019s holding would do, would leave\n\u00a7602(a)(1) without much to prohibit. It would become\nsuperfluous, without any real work to do.\n   We do not believe that this argument is a strong one.\nUnder Quality King\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7602(a)(1) would still\nforbid importing (without permission, and subject to the\nexceptions in \u00a7602(a)(3)) copies lawfully made abroad, for\nexample, where (1) a foreign publisher operating as the\nlicensee of an American publisher prints copies of a book\noverseas but, prior to any authorized sale, seeks to send\nthem to the United States; (2) a foreign printer or other\nmanufacturer (if not the \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of \u00a7109(a),\ne.g., before an authorized sale) sought to send copyrighted\ngoods to the United States; (3) \u201ca book publisher trans\u00ad\nports copies to a wholesaler\u201d and the wholesaler (not yet\nthe owner) sends them to the United States, see Copyright\nLaw Revision, pt. 4, at 211 (giving this example); or (4)\na foreign film distributor, having leased films for distri-\nbution, or any other licensee, consignee, or bailee sought to\nsend them to the United States. See, e.g., 2 Nimmer on\nCopyright \u00a78.12[B][1][a], at 8\u2013159 (\u201cSection 109(a) pro\u00ad\nvides that the distribution right may be exercised solely\nwith respect to the initial disposition of copies of a work,\nnot to prevent or restrict the resale or other further trans\u00ad\nfer of possession of such copies\u201d). These examples show\nthat \u00a7602(a)(1) retains significance. We concede it has less\nsignificance than the dissent believes appropriate, but the\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndissent also adopts a construction of \u00a7106(3) that \u201csignifi\u00ad\ncantly curtails\u201d \u00a7109(a)\u2019s effect, post, at 26, and so limits\nthe scope of that provision to a similar, or even greater,\ndegree.\n   In Quality King we rejected the \u201csuperfluous\u201d argument\nfor similar reasons. But, when rejecting it, we said that,\nwhere an author gives exclusive American distribution\nrights to an American publisher and exclusive British\ndistribution rights to a British publisher, \u201cpresumably\nonly those [copies] made by the publisher of the United\nStates edition would be \u2018lawfully made under this title\u2019\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7109(a).\u201d 523 U. S., at 148 (empha\u00ad\nsis added). Wiley now argues that this phrase in the\nQuality King opinion means that books published abroad\n(under license) must fall outside the words \u201clawfully made\nunder this title\u201d and that we have consequently already\ngiven those words the geographical interpretation that it\nfavors.\n   We cannot, however, give the Quality King statement\nthe legal weight for which Wiley argues. The language\n\u201clawfully made under this title\u201d was not at issue in Qual\u00ad\nity King; the point before us now was not then fully argued;\nwe did not canvas the considerations we have here set\nforth; we there said nothing to suggest that the example\nassumes a \u201cfirst sale\u201d; and we there hedged our state-\nment with the word \u201cpresumably.\u201d Most importantly, the\nstatement is pure dictum. It is dictum contained in a\nrebuttal to a counterargument. And it is unnecessary\ndictum even in that respect. Is the Court having once\nwritten dicta calling a tomato a vegetable bound to deny\nthat it is a fruit forever after?\n   To the contrary, we have written that we are not neces\u00ad\nsarily bound by dicta should more complete argument\ndemonstrate that the dicta is not correct. Central Va.\nCommunity College v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006)\n(\u201c[W]e are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in\n28        KIRTSAENG v.

S. 602,\n627\u2013628 (1935) (rejecting, under stare decisis, dicta, \u201cwhich\nmay be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are\nnot controlling\u201d). And, given the bit part that our Quality\nKing statement played in our Quality King decision, we\nbelieve the view of stare decisis set forth in these opinions\napplies to the matter now before us.\n   Second, Wiley and the dissent argue (to those who con\u00ad\nsider legislative history) that the Act\u2019s legislative history\nsupports their interpretation. But the historical events to\nwhich it points took place more than a decade before the\nenactment of the Act and, at best, are inconclusive.\n   During the 1960\u2019s, representatives of book, record, and\nfilm industries, meeting with the Register of Copyrights to\ndiscuss copyright revision, complained about the difficulty\nof dividing international markets.

I should guess, for example, that if\na book publisher transports [i.e., does not sell] copies to a\nwholesaler [i.e., a nonowner], this is not yet the kind of\ntransaction that exhausts the right to control disposition.\u201d\nIbid. (emphasis added).\n  The Office later withdrew the draft, replacing it with a\ndraft, which, by explicitly referring to \u00a7106, was similar to\nthe provision that became law, now \u00a7602(a)(1). The Office\nnoted in a report that, under the new draft, importation of\na copy (without permission) \u201cwould violate the exclusive\nrights of the U. S. copyright owner . . . where the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of copies in a foreign\ncountry for distribution only in that country.\u201d Id., pt. 6, at\n150.\n  Still, that part of the report says nothing about the \u201cfirst\nsale\u201d doctrine, about \u00a7109(a), or about the five words,\n30         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d And neither the report\nnor its accompanying 1960\u2019s draft answers the question\nbefore us here. Cf. Quality King, 523 U. S., at 145 (with\u00ad\nout those five words, the import clause, via its reference to\n\u00a7106, imports the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine).\n   But to ascertain the best reading of \u00a7109(a), rather\nthan dissecting the remarks of industry representatives\nconcerning \u00a7602 at congressional meetings held 10 years\nbefore the statute was enacted, see post, at 13\u201316, we\nwould give greater weight to the congressional report\naccompanying \u00a7109(a), written a decade later when Con\u00ad\ngress passed the new law. That report says:\n       \u201cSection 109(a) restates and confirms the principle\n     that, where the copyright owner has transferred own\u00ad\n     ership of a particular copy or phonorecord of a work,\n     the person to whom the copy or phonorecord is trans\u00ad\n     ferred is entitled to dispose of it by sale, rental, or any\n     other means. Under this principle, which has been\n     established by the court decisions and . . . the present\n     law, the copyright owner\u2019s exclusive right of public\n     distribution would have no effect upon anyone who\n     owns \u2018a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made\n     under this title\u2019 and who wishes to transfer it to\n     someone else or to destroy it.\n      .             .               .          .             .\n        \u201cTo come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy\n     or phonorecord must have been \u2018lawfully made under\n     this title,\u2019 though not necessarily with the copyright\n     owner\u2019s authorization. For example, any resale of an\n     illegally \u2018pirated\u2019 phonorecord would be an infringe\u00ad\n     ment but the disposition of a phonorecord legally\n     made under the compulsory licensing provisions of\n     section 115 would not.\u201d H.

No. 94\u2013473, pp. 71\u201372 (1975).\n   This history reiterates the importance of the \u201cfirst sale\u201d\ndoctrine. See, e.g., Copyright Law Revision, 1964 Revision\nBill with Discussions and Comments, 89th Cong., 1st\nSess., pt. 5, p. 66 (Comm. Print 1965) (\u201c[F]ull ownership of\na lawfully-made copy authorizes its owner to dispose of\nit freely\u201d). It explains, as we have explained, the nongeo\u00ad\ngraphical purposes of the words \u201clawfully made under this\ntitle.\u201d Part II\u2013B, supra. And it says nothing about geog\u00ad\nraphy. Nor, importantly, did \u00a7109(a)\u2019s predecessor provi\u00ad\nsion. See supra, at 12. This means that, contrary to the\ndissent\u2019s suggestion, any lack of legislative history per\u00ad\ntaining to the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine only tends to bolster\nour position that Congress\u2019 1976 revision did not intend to\ncreate a drastic geographical change in its revision to that\nprovision. See post, at 18, n. 13. We consequently believe\nthat the legislative history, on balance, supports the non-\ngeographical interpretation.\n   Third, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeograph\u00ad\nical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impos\u00ad\nsible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide\nforeign and domestic markets. We concede that is so. A\npublisher may find it more difficult to charge different\nprices for the same book in different geographic markets.\nBut we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can\nfind no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that\npublishers are especially entitled to such rights.\n   The Constitution describes the nature of American\ncopyright law by providing Congress with the power to\n\u201csecur[e]\u201d to \u201c[a]uthors\u201d \u201cfor limited [t]imes\u201d the \u201cexclusive\n[r]ight to their . . . [w]ritings.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8. The Found\u00ad\ners, too, discussed the need to grant an author a limited\nright to exclude competition. Compare Letter from Thomas\nJefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13\nPapers of Thomas Jefferson 440, 442\u2013443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956)\n(arguing against any monopoly) with Letter from James\n32        KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMadison to Thomas Jefferson (Oct. 17, 1788), in 14 id., at\n16, 21 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) (arguing for a limited monopoly\nto secure production). But the Constitution\u2019s language\nnowhere suggests that its limited exclusive right should\ninclude a right to divide markets or a concomitant right\nto charge different purchasers different prices for the same\nbook, say to increase or to maximize gain. Neither, to our\nknowledge, did any Founder make any such suggestion.\nWe have found no precedent suggesting a legal preference\nfor interpretations of copyright statutes that would pro\u00ad\nvide for market divisions. Cf. Copyright Law Revision, pt.\n2, at 194 (statement of Barbara Ringer, Copyright Office)\n(division of territorial markets was \u201cprimarily a matter of\nprivate contract\u201d).\n   To the contrary, Congress enacted a copyright law that\n(through the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine) limits copyright holders\u2019\nability to divide domestic markets. And that limitation is\nconsistent with antitrust laws that ordinarily forbid mar\u00ad\nket divisions. Cf. Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U. S. 46,\n49\u201350 (1990) (per curiam) (\u201c[A]greements between compet\u00ad\nitors to allocate territories to minimize competition are\nillegal\u201d). Whether copyright owners should, or should\nnot, have more than ordinary commercial power to divide\ninternational markets is a matter for Congress to decide.\nWe do no more here than try to determine what decision\nCongress has taken.\n   Fourth, the dissent and Wiley contend that our decision\nlaunches United States copyright law into an unprece\u00ad\ndented regime of \u201cinternational exhaustion.\u201d Post, at 18\u2013\n23; Brief for Respondent 45\u201346. But they point to nothing\nindicative of congressional intent in 1976. The dissent\nalso claims that it is clear that the United States now\nopposes adopting such a regime, but the Solicitor General\nas amicus has taken no such position in this case. In fact,\nwhen pressed at oral argument, the Solicitor General\nstated that the consequences of Wiley\u2019s reading of the\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 51. And the dissent\u2019s reliance\non the Solicitor General\u2019s position in Quality King is under-\nmined by his agreement in that case with our reading\nof \u00a7109(a). Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 1470, p. 30 (\u201cWhen . . .

Neither the text\nnor the history of 17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a) supports removing\nfirst-sale protection from every copy of a protected work\nmanufactured abroad. See ante, at 8\u201316, 28\u201331. I recog-\nnize, however, that the combination of today\u2019s decision\nand Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 523 U. S. 135 (1998), constricts the scope of\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation. I write to\nsuggest that any problems associated with that limitation\ncome not from our reading of \u00a7109(a) here, but from Qual-\nity King\u2019s holding that \u00a7109(a) limits \u00a7602(a)(1).\n   As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine has played\nan integral part in American copyright law for over a\ncentury. See ante, at 17\u201319; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus,\n210 U. S. 339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior\nto 1976 even arguably limited its application to copies\nmade in the United States. See ante, at 12. And nothing\nin the text or history of \u00a7109(a)\u2014the Copyright Act of\n1976\u2019s first-sale provision\u2014suggests that Congress meant\nto enact the new, geographical restriction John Wiley\nproposes, which at once would deprive American consum-\ners of important rights and encourage copyright holders to\nmanufacture abroad. See ante, at 8\u201316, 28\u201331.\n2           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n   That said, John Wiley is right that the Court\u2019s decision,\nwhen combined with Quality King, substantially narrows\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation. Quality\nKing held that the importation ban does not reach any\ncopies receiving first-sale protection under \u00a7109(a). See\n523 U. S., at 151\u2013152. So notwithstanding \u00a7602(a)(1), an\n\u201cowner of a particular copy . . . lawfully made under this\ntitle\u201d can import that copy without the copyright owner\u2019s\npermission. \u00a7109(a). In now holding that copies \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d include copies manufactured\nabroad, we unavoidably diminish \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s scope\u2014\nindeed, limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See\nante, at 26\u201327.\n   But if Congress views the shrinking of \u00a7602(a)(1) as a\nproblem, it should recognize Quality King\u2014not our deci-\nsion today\u2014as the culprit. Here, after all, we merely\nconstrue \u00a7109(a); Quality King is the decision holding that\n\u00a7109(a) limits \u00a7602(a)(1). Had we come out the opposite\nway in that case, \u00a7602(a)(1) would allow a copyright owner\nto restrict the importation of copies irrespective of the\nfirst-sale doctrine.1 That result would enable the copy-\nright owner to divide international markets in the way\nJohn Wiley claims Congress intended when enacting\n\u00a7602(a)(1). But it would do so without imposing down-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Although Quality King concluded that the statute\u2019s text foreclosed\n\nthat outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151\u2013152, the Solicitor General offered a\ncogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that \u00a7109(a) does not\nlimit \u00a7602(a)(1) because the former authorizes owners only to \u201csell\u201d or\n\u201cdispose\u201d of copies\u2014not to import them: The Act\u2019s first-sale provision\nand its importation ban thus regulate separate, non-overlapping\nspheres of conduct. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in\nQuality King, O. T. 1996, No. 96\u20131470, pp. 5, 8\u201310. That reading\nremains the Government\u2019s preferred way of construing the statute. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 44 (\u201c[W]e think that we still would adhere to our view\nthat section 109(a) should not be read as a limitation on section\n602(a)(1)\u201d); see also ante, at 32\u201333; post, at 21, n. 15 (GINSBURG, J.,\ndissenting).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

In other words, that outcome would tar-\nget unauthorized importers alone, and not the \u201clibraries,\nused-book dealers, technology companies, consumer-goods\nretailers, and museums\u201d with whom the Court today is\nrightly concerned. Ante, at 19. Assuming Congress\nadopted \u00a7602(a)(1) to permit market segmentation, I sus-\npect that is how Congress thought the provision would\nwork\u2014not by removing first-sale protection from every copy\nmanufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do here),\nbut by enabling the copyright holder to control imports\neven when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King\nnow prevents).2\n  At bottom, John Wiley (together with the dissent) asks\nus to misconstrue \u00a7109(a) in order to restore \u00a7602(a)(1)\nto its purportedly rightful function of enabling copyright\nholders to segment international markets. I think John\nWiley may have a point about what \u00a7602(a)(1) was de-\nsigned to do; that gives me pause about Quality King\u2019s\nholding that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation\nban\u2019s scope. But the Court today correctly declines the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Indeed, allowing the copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective\n\nof the first-sale doctrine\u2014i.e., reversing Quality King\u2014would yield a\nfar more sensible scheme of market segmentation than would adopting\nJohn Wiley\u2019s argument here. That is because only the former approach\nturns on the intended market for copies; the latter rests instead on their\nplace of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley\nprints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute certain\nversions only in Thailand. Without Quality King, John Wiley could do\nso\u2014i.e., produce books in New York, ship them to Thailand, and pre-\nvent anyone from importing them back into the United States. But\nwith Quality King, that course is not open to John Wiley even under its\nreading of \u00a7109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-\nimporting the books\u2014and so to segment the Thai market\u2014John Wiley\nwould have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no reason\nwhy Congress would have conditioned a copyright owner\u2019s power to\ndivide markets on outsourcing its manufacturing to a foreign country.\n4         KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    KAGAN, J., concurring\n\ninvitation to save \u00a7602(a)(1) from Quality King by destroy-\ning the first-sale protection that \u00a7109(a) gives to every\nowner of a copy manufactured abroad. That would swap\none (possible) mistake for a much worse one, and make\nour reading of the statute only less reflective of Congres-\nsional intent. If Congress thinks copyright owners need\ngreater power to restrict importation and thus divide\nmarkets, a ready solution is at hand\u2014not the one John\nWiley offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in\nQuality King.\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom the Court\u2019s embrace of \u201cinternational exhaustion,\u201d\nand would affirm the sound judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                              I\n   Because economic conditions and demand for particular\ngoods vary across the globe, copyright owners have a\nfinancial incentive to charge different prices for copies of\ntheir works in different geographic regions. Their ability\nto engage in such price discrimination, however, is under-\nmined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies\nfrom low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions.\nThe question in this case is whether the unauthorized\nimportation of foreign-made copies constitutes copyright\ninfringement under U. S. law.\n   To answer this question, one must examine three provi\u00ad\nsions of Title 17 of the U. S. Code: \u00a7\u00a7106(3), 109(a), and\n602(a)(1). Section 106 sets forth the \u201cexclusive rights\u201d of a\ncopyright owner, including the right \u201cto distribute copies\nor phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by\nsale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or\nlending.\u201d \u00a7106(3). This distribution right is limited by\n\u00a7109(a), which provides: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions\nof section 106(3), the owner of a particular copy or phono-\nrecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,\nwithout the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or\notherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or\nphonorecord.\u201d Section 109(a) codifies the \u201cfirst sale doc\u00ad\ntrine,\u201d a doctrine articulated in Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.\nStraus, 210 U. S. 339, 349\u2013351 (1908), which held that a\ncopyright owner could not control the price at which re\u00ad\ntailers sold lawfully purchased copies of its work. The\nfirst sale doctrine recognizes that a copyright owner\nshould not be permitted to exercise perpetual control over\nthe distribution of copies of a copyrighted work.

Quality King thus held that\nthe importation of copies made in the United States but\nsold abroad did not rank as copyright infringement\nunder \u00a7602(a)(1). Id., at 143\u2013154.

Drawing on an\nexample discussed during a 1964 public meeting on pro\u00ad\nposed revisions to the U.

The Court\u2019s\nobjective in this case should be to avoid unduly \u201cconstrict[ing] the scope\nof \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s ban on unauthorized importation,\u201d ante, at 1 (opinion of\nKAGAN, J.), while at the same time remaining faithful to Quality King\u2019s\nholding and to the text and history of other Copyright Act provisions.\nThis aim is not difficult to achieve.

Petitioner Supap Kirtsaeng imported and then\nsold at a profit over 600 copies of copyrighted textbooks\nprinted outside the United States by the Asian subsidiary\nof respondent John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (Wiley). App. 29\u2013\n34. See also ante, at 3\u20135 (opinion of the Court). In the\nwords the Court used in Quality King, these copies \u201cwere\n\u2018lawfully made\u2019 not under the United States Copyright\nAct, but instead, under the law of some other country.\u201d\n523 U. S., at 147. Section 109(a) therefore does not ap-\nply, and Kirtsaeng\u2019s unauthorized importation constitutes\ncopyright infringement under \u00a7602(a)(1).\n   The Court does not deny that under the language I have\nquoted from Quality King, Wiley would prevail. Ante, at\n27. Nevertheless, the Court dismisses this language, to\nwhich all Members of the Quality King Court subscribed,\nas ill-considered dictum. Ante, at 27\u201328. I agree that the\ndiscussion was dictum in the sense that it was not essen\u00ad\ntial to the Court\u2019s judgment. See Quality King, 523 U. S.,\nat 154 (GINSBURG, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e do not today\nresolve cases in which the allegedly infringing imports\nwere manufactured abroad.\u201d). But I disagree with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion that this dictum was ill considered.\nInstead, for the reasons explained below, I would hold,\nconsistently with Quality King\u2019s dictum, that \u00a7602(a)(1)\nauthorizes a copyright owner to bar the importation of a\ncopy manufactured abroad for sale abroad.\n                            II\n  The text of the Copyright Act demonstrates that Con\u00ad\ngress intended to provide copyright owners with a potent\n6         KIRTSAENG v.

As the Court recognizes, ante, at\n3, this case turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d in \u00a7109(a). In my view, that phrase\nis most sensibly read as referring to instances in which a\ncopy\u2019s creation is governed by, and conducted in compli\u00ad\nance with, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. This reading is\nconsistent with the Court\u2019s interpretation of similar lan\u00ad\nguage in other statutes. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v.\nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U. S. 33, 52\u201353 (2008)\n(\u201cunder\u201d in 11 U. S.

The printing of Wiley\u2019s foreign\u00ad\nmanufactured textbooks therefore was not governed by\nTitle 17. The textbooks thus were not \u201clawfully made\n                      Cite as: 568 U.

And if \u00a7109(a) does not apply, there is no dis\u00ad\npute that Kirtsaeng\u2019s conduct constituted copyright in\u00ad\nfringement under \u00a7602(a)(1).\n   The Court\u2019s point of departure is similar to mine. Ac\u00ad\ncording to the Court, the phrase \u201c \u2018lawfully made under\nthis title\u2019 means made \u2018in accordance with\u2019 or \u2018in compli\u00ad\nance with\u2019 the Copyright Act.\u201d Ante, at 8. But the Court\noverlooks that, according to the very dictionaries it cites,\nante, at 9, the word \u201cunder\u201d commonly signals a relation\u00ad\nship of subjection, where one thing is governed or regu-\nlated by another. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1525 (6th ed.\n1990) (\u201cunder\u201d \u201cfrequently\u201d means \u201cinferior\u201d or \u201csubordi\u00ad\nnate\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); 18 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 950 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cunder\u201d means,\namong other things, \u201c[i]n accordance with (some regulative\npower or principle)\u201d (emphasis added)). See also Webster\u2019s\nThird New International Dictionary 2487 (1961) (\u201cunder\u201d\nmeans, among other things, \u201cin . . . a condition of sub-\njection, regulation, or subordination\u201d and \u201csuffering re\u00ad\nstriction, restraint, or control by\u201d). Only by disregarding\nthis established meaning of \u201cunder\u201d can the Court arrive\nat the conclusion that Wiley\u2019s foreign-manufactured text\u00ad\nbooks were \u201clawfully made under\u201d U. S. copyright law,\neven though that law did not govern their creation. It is\nanomalous, however, to speak of particular conduct as\n\u201clawful\u201d under an inapplicable law. For example, one\nmight say that driving on the right side of the road in\nEngland is \u201clawful\u201d under U. S. law, but that would be so\nonly because U. S. law has nothing to say about the sub\u00ad\nject. The governing law is English law, and English law\ndemands that driving be done on the left side of the road.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Court asserts that my position gives the word \u201clawfully\u201d in\n\n\u00a7109(a) \u201clittle, if any, linguistic work to do.\u201d Ante, at 9. That is not so.\nMy reading gives meaning to each word in the phrase \u201clawfully made\n8            KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  The logical implication of the Court\u2019s definition of the\nword \u201cunder\u201d is that any copy manufactured abroad\u2014even\na piratical one made without the copyright owner\u2019s author\u00ad\nization and in violation of the law of the country where it\nwas created\u2014would fall within the scope of \u00a7109(a). Any\nsuch copy would have been made \u201cin accordance with\u201d or\n\u201cin compliance with\u201d the U. S. Copyright Act, in the sense\nthat manufacturing the copy did not violate the Act (be\u00ad\ncause the Act does not apply extraterritorially).\n  The Court rightly refuses to accept such an absurd\nconclusion. Instead, it interprets \u00a7109(a) as applying only\nto copies whose making actually complied with Title 17, or\nwould have complied with Title 17 had Title 17 been ap\u00ad\nplicable (i.e., had the copies been made in the United\nStates). See ante, at 8 (\u201c\u00a7109(a)\u2019s \u2018first sale\u2019 doctrine would\napply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture\nmet the requirements of American copyright law.\u201d). Con\u00ad\ngress, however, used express language when it called for\nsuch a counterfactual inquiry in 17 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7602(a)(2)\nand (b). See \u00a7602(a)(2) (\u201cImportation into the United\nStates or exportation from the United States, without the\nauthority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\ncopies or phonorecords, the making of which either consti\u00ad\ntuted an infringement of copyright, or which would have\nconstituted an infringement of copyright if this title had\nbeen applicable, is an infringement of the exclusive right\nto distribute copies or phonorecords under section 106.\u201d\n(emphasis added)); \u00a7602(b) (\u201cIn a case where the making\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nunder this title.\u201d The word \u201cmade\u201d signifies that the conduct at issue is\nthe creation or manufacture of a copy. See Webster\u2019s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 1356 (1961) (defining \u201cmade\u201d as \u201cartificially\nproduced by a manufacturing process\u201d). The word \u201clawfully\u201d indicates\nthat for \u00a7109(a) to apply, the copy\u2019s creation must have complied with\nsome body of law. Finally, the prepositional phrase \u201cunder this title\u201d\nclarifies what that body of law is\u2014namely, the copyright prescriptions\ncontained in Title 17 of the U. S. Code.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Had\nCongress intended courts to engage in a similarly hypo\u00ad\nthetical inquiry under \u00a7109(a), Congress would pre-\nsumably have included similar language in that section.\nSee Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)\n(\u201c \u2018[W]here Congress includes particular language in one\nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the\nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo,\n472 F. 2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972) (per curiam); brackets in\noriginal)).5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Attempting  to show that my reading of \u00a7109(a) is susceptible to the\nsame criticism, the Court points to the now-repealed \u201cmanufacturing\nclause,\u201d which required \u201ccopies of a work consisting preponderantly of\nnondramatic literary material . . . in the English language\u201d to be\n\u201cmanufactured in the United States or Canada.\u201d Copyright Act of 1976,\n\u00a7601(a), 90 Stat. 2588. Because Congress expressly referred to manu\u00ad\nfacturing in this provision, the Court contends, the phrase \u201clawfully\nmade under this title\u201d in \u00a7109(a) cannot mean \u201cmanufactured in the\nUnited States.\u201d Ante, at 19. This argument is a non sequitur. I do not\ncontend that the phrases \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d and \u201cmanu\u00ad\nfactured in the United States\u201d are interchangeable. To repeat, I read\nthe phrase \u201clawfully made under this title\u201d as referring to instances in\nwhich a copy\u2019s creation is governed by, and conducted in compliance\nwith, Title 17 of the U. S. Code. See supra, at 6. Not all copies \u201cmanu\u00ad\nfactured in the United States\u201d will satisfy this standard. For example,\npiratical copies manufactured in the United States without the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s authorization are not \u201clawfully made under [Title 17].\u201d\nNor would the phrase \u201clawfully manufactured in the United States\u201d be\nan exact substitute for \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d The making of\na copy may be lawful under Title 17 yet still violate some other provi\u00ad\nsion of law. Consider, for example, a copy made with the copyright\nowner\u2019s authorization by workers who are paid less than minimum\nwage. The copy would be \u201clawfully made under [Title 17]\u201d in the sense\nthat its creation would not violate any provision of that title, but the\ncopy\u2019s manufacturing would nonetheless be unlawful due to the viola\u00ad\n10           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Not only does the Court adopt an unnatural construc\u00ad\ntion of the \u00a7109(a) phrase \u201clawfully made under this title.\u201d\nConcomitantly, the Court reduces \u00a7602(a)(1) to insignifi\u00ad\ncance. As the Court appears to acknowledge, see ante, at\n26, the only independent effect \u00a7602(a)(1) has under to\u00ad\nday\u2019s decision is to prohibit unauthorized importations\ncarried out by persons who merely have possession of, but\ndo not own, the imported copies. See 17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a)\n(\u00a7109(a) applies to any \u201cowner of a particular copy or\nphonorecord lawfully made under this title\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).6 If this is enough to avoid rendering \u00a7602(a)(1)\nentirely \u201csuperfluous,\u201d ante, at 26, it hardly suffices to give\nthe owner\u2019s importation right the scope Congress intended\nit to have. Congress used broad language in \u00a7602(a)(1); it\ndid so to achieve a broad objective. Had Congress intended\nsimply to provide a copyright remedy against larcenous\nlessees, licensees, consignees, and bailees of films and\nother copyright-protected goods, see ante, at 13\u201314, 26, it\nlikely would have used language tailored to that narrow\npurpose. See 2 Nimmer \u00a78.12[B][6][c], at 8\u2013184.31, n. 432\n(\u201cIt may be wondered whether . . . potential causes of\naction [against licensees and the like] are more than theo\u00ad\nretical.\u201d).

See Quality King, 523 U. S., at 146. In 2008, however,\nCongress amended \u00a7602 to provide for such a cause of action in\n\u00a7602(a)(2), which prohibits the unauthorized \u201c[i]mportation into the\nUnited States . . . of copies or phonorecords, the making of which either\nconstituted an infringement of copyright, or which would have consti\u00ad\ntuted an infringement of copyright if [Title 17] had been applicable.\u201d\nSee PROIPA, \u00a7105(b)(3), 122 Stat. 4259\u20134260. Thus, under the Court\u2019s\ninterpretation, the only conduct reached by \u00a7602(a)(1) but not\n\u00a7602(a)(2) is a nonowner\u2019s unauthorized importation of a nonpiratical\ncopy.\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Instead, the primary purpose of \u00a7602(a)(1)\nwas to reach third-party importers, enterprising actors like Kirtsaeng,\nagainst whom copyright owners could not assert contract claims due to\nlack of privity. See Part III, infra.\n   8 Section 602(a)(3) provides:\n\n\u201cThis subsection [i.e., \u00a7602(a)] does not apply to\u2014\n   \u201c(A) importation or exportation of copies or phonorecords under the\nauthority or for the use of the Government of the United States or of\nany State or political subdivision of a State, but not including copies or\nphonorecords for use in schools, or copies of any audiovisual work\nimported for purposes other than archival use;\n   \u201c(B) importation or exportation, for the private use of the importer or\nexporter and not for distribution, by any person with respect to no more\nthan one copy or phonorecord of any one work at any one time, or by\nany person arriving from outside the United States or departing from\nthe United States with respect to copies or phonorecords forming part\nof such person\u2019s personal baggage; or\n   \u201c(C) importation by or for an organization operated for scholarly,\neducational, or religious purposes and not for private gain, with respect\nto no more than one copy of an audiovisual work solely for its archival\npurposes, and no more than five copies or phonorecords of any other\nwork for its library lending or archival purposes, unless the importation\nof such copies or phonorecords is part of an activity consisting of sys\u00ad\ntematic reproduction or distribution, engaged in by such organization\nin violation of the provisions of section 108(g)(2).\u201d\n12           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\u00a77.6.1.2(a), at 7:141.9 But if, as the Court holds, such\ncopies can in any event be imported by virtue of \u00a7109(a),\n\u00a7602(a)(3)\u2019s work has already been done. For example,\nhad Congress conceived of \u00a7109(a)\u2019s sweep as the Court\ndoes, what earthly reason would there be to provide, as\nCongress did in \u00a7602(a)(3)(C), that a library may import\n\u201cno more than five copies\u201d of a non-audiovisual work for its\n\u201clending or archival purposes\u201d?\n   The far more plausible reading of \u00a7\u00a7109(a) and 602(a),\nthen, is that Congress intended \u00a7109(a) to apply to copies\nmade in the United States, not to copies manufactured\nand sold abroad. That reading of the first sale and impor\u00ad\ntation provisions leaves \u00a7602(a)(3)\u2019s exceptions with real,\nmeaningful work to do. See TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of statutory\nconstruction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so\nconstrued that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sen\u00ad\ntence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the range of circum-\nstances covered by the exceptions, \u00a7602(a)(3) frees indi\u00ad\nviduals and entities who purchase foreign-made copies\nabroad from the requirement they would otherwise face\nunder \u00a7602(a)(1) of obtaining the copyright owner\u2019s per\u00ad\nmission to import the copies into the United States.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The term \u201cgray market good\u201d refers to a good that is \u201cimported out\u00ad\n\nside the distribution channels that have been contractually negotiated\nby the intellectual property owner.\u201d Forsyth & Rothnie, Parallel\nImports, in The Interface Between Intellectual Property Rights and\nCompetition Policy 429 (S. Anderman ed. 2007). Such goods are also\ncommonly called \u201cparallel imports.\u201d Ibid.\n  10 The Court asserts that its reading of \u00a7109(a) is bolstered by \u00a7104,\n\nwhich extends the copyright \u201cprotection[s]\u201d of Title 17 to a wide variety\nof foreign works. See ante, at 10\u201311. The \u201cprotection under this title\u201d\nafforded by \u00a7104, however, is merely protection against infringing\nconduct within the United States, the only place where Title 17 applies.\nSee 4 W.

Section\n602(a)(1) was enacted as part of the Copyright Act of 1976,\n90 Stat. 2589\u20132590. That Act was the product of a lengthy\nrevision effort overseen by the U. S. Copyright Office. See\nMills Music, Inc. v. Snyder, 469 U. S. 153, 159\u2013160 (1985).\nIn its initial 1961 report on recommended revisions, the\nCopyright Office noted that publishers had \u201csuggested\nthat the [then-existing] import ban on piratical copies\nshould be extended to bar the importation of . . . foreign\nedition[s]\u201d in violation of \u201cagreements to divide interna\u00ad\ntional markets for copyrighted works.\u201d Copyright Law\nRevision: Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law, 87th Cong.,\n1st Sess., 126 (H. R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1961) (herein\u00ad\nafter Copyright Law Revision). See Copyright Act of 1947,\n\u00a7106, 61 Stat. 663 (\u201cThe importation into the United\nStates . . . of any piratical copies of any work copyrighted\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a7109(a) is consistent with Congress\u2019 use of that phrase in \u00a7104. Fur\u00ad\nthermore, \u00a7104 describes which works are entitled to copyright protec\u00ad\ntion under U. S. law. But no one disputes that Wiley\u2019s copyrights in the\nworks at issue in this case are valid. The only question is whether\nKirtsaeng\u2019s importation of copies of those works infringed Wiley\u2019s\ncopyrights. It is basic to copyright law that \u201c[o]wnership of a copyright\n. . . is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work\nis embodied.\u201d 17 U. S. C. \u00a7202. See also \u00a7101 (\u201c \u2018Copies\u2019 are material\nobjects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any\nmethod now known or later developed, and from which the work can be\nperceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or\nwith the aid of a machine or device.\u201d). Given the distinction copyright\nlaw draws between works and copies, \u00a7104 is inapposite to the question\nhere presented. 4 Patry \u00a713:44.10, at 13\u2013129 (\u201cThere is no connection,\nlinguistically or substantively, between Section[s] 104 and 109: Section\n104 deals with national eligibility for the intangible work of authorship;\nSection 109(a) deals with the tangible, physical embodiment of the\nwork, the \u2018copy.\u2019 \u201d).\n14         KIRTSAENG v.

The Copyright\nOffice originally recommended against such an extension\nof the importation ban, reasoning that enforcement of\nterritorial restrictions was best left to contract law. Copy\u00ad\nright Law Revision 126.\n   Publishing-industry representatives argued strenuously\nagainst the position initially taken by the Copyright Of\u00ad\nfice. At a 1962 panel discussion on the Copyright Office\u2019s\nreport, for example, Horace Manges of the American Book\nPublishers Council stated:\n     \u201cWhen a U. S. book publisher enters into a contract\n     with a British publisher to acquire exclusive U. S.\n     rights for a particular book, he often finds that the\n     English edition . . . of that particular book finds its\n     way into this country. Now it\u2019s all right to say, \u2018Com\u00ad\n     mence a lawsuit for breach of contract.\u2019 But this is\n     expensive, burdensome, and, for the most part, inef\u00ad\n     fective.\u201d Copyright Law Revision Part 2: Discussion\n     and Comments on Report of the Register of Copy\u00ad\n     rights on the General Revision of the U.

To illustrate, Diamond\nnoted, if a \u201cBritish publisher [sells a copy] to an individual\nwho in turn ship[s] it over\u201d to the United States, the indi\u00ad\nvidual\u2019s conduct would not \u201cviolate [any] contract between\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

In such a\ncase, \u201cno possibility of any contract remedy\u201d would exist.\nIbid. The facts of Kirtsaeng\u2019s case fit Diamond\u2019s example,\nsave that the copies at issue here were printed and ini-\ntially sold in Asia rather than Great Britain.\n   After considering comments on its 1961 report, the\nCopyright Office \u201cprepared a preliminary draft of provi\u00ad\nsions for a new copyright statute.\u201d Copyright Law Revi\u00ad\nsion Part 3: Preliminary Draft for Revised U. S. Copyright\nLaw and Discussions and Comments on the Draft, 88th\nCong., 2d Sess., V (H. R. Judiciary Comm.

In particu\u00ad\nlar, \u00a744(a) provided:\n    \u201cImportation into the United States of copies or rec\u00ad\n    ords of a work for the purpose of distribution to the\n    public shall, if such articles are imported without the\n    authority of the owner of the exclusive right to dis\u00ad\n    tribute copies or records under this title, constitute an\n    infringement of copyright actionable under section 35\n    [i.e., the section providing for a private cause of action\n    for copyright infringement].\u201d Id., at 32\u201333.\n   In a 1964 panel discussion regarding the draft statute,\nAbe Goldman, the Copyright Office\u2019s General Counsel, left\nno doubt about the meaning of \u00a744(a). It represented, he\nexplained, a \u201cshif[t]\u201d from the Copyright Office\u2019s 1961\nreport, which had recommended against using copyright\nlaw to facilitate publishers\u2019 efforts to segment interna\u00ad\ntional markets.

Section 44(a), Gold\u00ad\nman stated, would allow copyright owners to bring in\u00ad\nfringement actions against importers of \u201cforeign copies\nthat were made under proper authority.\u201d Ibid.

R. Judiciary Comm. Print 1965). After another round\nof public comments, a revised bill was introduced on Feb\u00ad\nruary 4, 1965. See Copyright Law Revision Part 6: Sup\u00ad\nplementary Report of the Register of Copyrights on the\nGeneral Revision of the U. S. Copyright Law: 1965 Revi\u00ad\nsion Bill, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., V (H. R. Judiciary Comm.\nPrint 1965) (hereinafter Copyright Law Revision Part 6).\nIn language closely resembling the statutory text later\nenacted by Congress, \u00a7602(a) of the 1965 bill provided:\n     \u201cImportation into the United States, without the au\u00ad\n     thority of the owner of copyright under this title, of\n     copies or phonorecords of a work for the purpose of\n     distribution to the public is an infringement of the ex\u00ad\n     clusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords un\u00ad\n     der section 106, actionable under section 501.\u201d Id., at\n     292.12\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 As the Court observes, ante, at 29, Irwin Karp of the Authors\n\nLeague of America stated at the 1964 panel discussion that \u00a744(a) ran\ncounter to \u201cthe very basic concept of copyright law that, once you\u2019ve sold\na copy legally, you can\u2019t restrict its resale.\u201d Copyright Law Revision\nPart 4, at 212. When asked if he was \u201cpresenting . . . an argument\nagainst\u201d \u00a744(a), however, Karp responded that he was \u201cneutral on th[e]\nprovision.\u201d Id., at 211. There is thus little reason to believe that any\nchanges to the wording of \u00a744(a) before its codification in \u00a7602(a) were\nmade in response to Karp\u2019s discussion of \u201cthe problem of restricting\n[the] transfer of . . . lawfully obtained [foreign] copies.\u201d Ibid.\n  12 There is but one difference between this language from the 1965\n\nbill and the corresponding language in the current version of \u00a7602(a)(1):\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Ante, at 29. The\nCopyright Office, however, did not see it that way. In its\nsummary of the 1965 bill\u2019s provisions, the Copyright Office\nobserved that \u00a7602(a) of the 1965 bill, like \u00a744(a) of the\nCopyright Office\u2019s prior draft, see supra, at 15\u201316, permit\u00ad\nted copyright owners to bring infringement actions against\nunauthorized importers in cases \u201cwhere the copyright\nowner had authorized the making of [the imported] copies\nin a foreign country for distribution only in that country.\u201d\nCopyright Law Revision Part 6, at 149\u2013150. See also id.,\nat XXVI (Under \u00a7602(a) of the 1965 bill, \u201c[a]n unauthorized\nimporter could be enjoined and sued for damages both\nwhere the copies or phonorecords he was importing\nwere \u2018piratical\u2019 (that is, where their making would have\nconstituted an infringement if the U.

See Copyright Act of 1976, \u00a7602(a), 90 Stat.\n2589\u20132590. The House and Senate Committee Reports on\nthe 1976 Act demonstrate that Congress understood, as\ndid the Copyright Office, just what that text meant. Both\nReports state:\n     \u201cSection 602 [deals] with two separate situations: im\u00ad\n     portation of \u2018piratical\u2019 articles (that is, copies or\n     phonorecords made without any authorization of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn the current version, the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of distribution to the\npublic\u201d is omitted and the phrase \u201cthat have been acquired outside the\nUnited States\u201d appears in its stead. There are no material differences\nbetween the quoted language from the 1965 bill and the corresponding\nlanguage contained in the 1964 bill.

The\n     general approach of section 602 is to make unauthor-\n     ized importation an act of infringement in both cases,\n     but to permit the Bureau of Customs to prohibit im\u00ad\n     portation only of \u2018piratical\u2019 articles.\u201d S.

To the con-\ntrary, it confirms what the plain text of the Act conveys:\nCongress intended \u00a7602(a)(1) to provide copyright owners\nwith a remedy against the unauthorized importation of\nforeign-made copies of their works, even if those copies\nwere made and sold abroad with the copyright owner\u2019s\nauthorization.13\n                             IV\n  Unlike the Court\u2019s holding, my position is consistent with\nthe stance the United States has taken in international\u00ad\ntrade negotiations. This case bears on the highly con\u00ad\ntentious trade issue of interterritorial exhaustion. The\nissue arises because intellectual property law is territorial\nin nature, see supra, at 6, which means that creators of\nintellectual property \u201cmay hold a set of parallel\u201d intellec\u00ad\ntual property rights under the laws of different nations.\nChiappetta, The Desirability of Agreeing to Disagree: The\nWTO, TRIPS, International IPR Exhaustion and a Few\nOther Things, 21 Mich.

Another option is a rule of international\nexhaustion, under which the authorized distribution of a\nparticular copy anywhere in the world exhausts the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s distribution right everywhere with respect\nto that copy.

The Court\u2019s decision, in con-\ntrast, places the United States solidly in the international\u00ad\nexhaustion camp.\n   Strong arguments have been made both in favor of, and\nin opposition to, international exhaustion. See Chiappetta\n360 (\u201c[r]easonable people making valid points can, and\ndo, reach conflicting conclusions\u201d regarding the desirability\nof international exhaustion). International exhaustion\nsubjects copyright-protected goods to competition from\nlower priced imports and, to that extent, benefits con-\nsumers. Correspondingly, copyright owners profit from a\nnational-exhaustion regime, which also enlarges the mon\u00ad\netary incentive to create new copyrightable works. See\nForsyth & Rothnie 432\u2013437 (surveying arguments for and\nagainst international exhaustion).\n   Weighing the competing policy concerns, our Govern\u00ad\nment reached the conclusion that widespread adoption of\nthe international-exhaustion framework would be incon\u00ad\nsistent with the long-term economic interests of the United\nStates.

At that time, no statutory provision\nexpressly codified the first sale doctrine. Instead, copy\u00ad\nright law merely provided that copyright owners had \u201cthe\nsole liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, completing,\ncopying, executing, finishing, and vending\u201d their works.\nCopyright Act of 1891, \u00a71, 26 Stat. 1107.\n   In Bobbs-Merrill, the Court addressed the scope of the\nstatutory right to \u201cven[d].\u201d In granting that right, the\nCourt held, Congress did not intend to permit copyright\nowners \u201cto fasten . . . a restriction upon the subsequent\nalienation of the subject-matter of copyright after the\nowner had parted with the title to one who had acquired\nfull dominion over it and had given a satisfactory price for\nit.\u201d 210 U. S., at 349\u2013350. \u201c[O]ne who has sold a copy\u00ad\nrighted article . . . without restriction,\u201d the Court ex\u00ad\nplained, \u201chas parted with all right to control the sale of it.\u201d\nId., at 350. Thus, \u201c[t]he purchaser of a book, once sold by\nauthority of the owner of the copyright, may sell it again,\nalthough he could not publish a new edition of it.\u201d Ibid.\n   Under the logic of Bobbs-Merrill, the sale of a foreign\u00ad\nmanufactured copy in the United States carried out with\nthe copyright owner\u2019s authorization would exhaust the\ncopyright owner\u2019s right to \u201cvend\u201d that copy. The copy\ncould thenceforth be resold, lent out, or otherwise redis\u00ad\ntributed without further authorization from the copyright\nowner. Although \u00a7106(3) uses the word \u201cdistribute\u201d rather\nthan \u201cvend,\u201d there is no reason to think Congress intended\nthe word \u201cdistribute\u201d to bear a meaning different from the\nconstruction the Court gave to the word \u201cvend\u201d in Bobbs-\nMerrill. See ibid.

JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nThus, in accord with Bobbs-Merrill, the first authorized\ndistribution of a foreign-made copy in the United States\nexhausts the copyright owner\u2019s distribution right under\n\u00a7106(3). After such an authorized distribution, a library\nmay lend, or a used-book dealer may resell, the foreign\u00ad\nmade copy without seeking the copyright owner\u2019s permis\u00ad\nsion. Cf. ante, at 19\u201321.\n   For example, if Wiley, rather than Kirtsaeng, had\nimported into the United States and then sold the foreign\u00ad\nmade textbooks at issue in this case, Wiley\u2019s \u00a7106(3) dis\u00ad\ntribution right would have been exhausted under the\nrationale of Bobbs-Merrill. Purchasers of the textbooks\nwould thus be free to dispose of the books as they wished\nwithout first gaining a license from Wiley.\n   This line of reasoning, it must be acknowledged, signifi\u00ad\ncantly curtails the independent effect of \u00a7109(a). If, as I\nmaintain, the term \u201cdistribute\u201d in \u00a7106(3) incorporates the\nfirst sale doctrine by virtue of Bobbs-Merrill, then\n\u00a7109(a)\u2019s codification of that doctrine adds little to the\nregulatory regime.20 Section 109(a), however, does serve\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthat the exclusive rights to \u201cpublish\u201d and \u201cvend\u201d works under the\nCopyright Act of 1947, \u00a71(a), 61 Stat. 652\u2013653, were \u201credundant\u201d).\n  20 My position that Bobbs-Merrill lives on as a limiting construction of\n\nthe \u00a7106(3) distribution right does not leave \u00a7109(a) with no work to do.\nThere can be little doubt that the books at issue in Bobbs-Merrill were\npublished and first sold in the United States.

Congress first codified the first\nsale doctrine in \u00a741 of the Copyright Act of 1909, 35 Stat.\n1084.21 It did so, the House Committee Report on the\n1909 Act explains, \u201cin order to make . . . clear that [Con\u00ad\ngress had] no intention [of] enlarg[ing] in any way the\nconstruction to be given to the word \u2018vend.\u2019 \u201d H. R. Rep.\nNo. 2222, 60th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1909). According to the\nCommittee Report, \u00a741 was \u201cnot intended to change [exist\u00ad\ning law] in any way.\u201d Ibid. The position I have stated and\nexplained accords with this expression of congressional\nintent. In enacting \u00a741 and its successors, I would hold,\nCongress did not \u201cchange . . . existing law,\u201d ibid., by strip\u00ad\nping the word \u201cvend\u201d (and thus its substitute \u201cdistribute\u201d)\nof the limiting construction imposed in Bobbs-Merrill.\n   In any event, the reading of the Copyright Act to which\nI subscribe honors Congress\u2019 aim in enacting \u00a7109(a)\nwhile the Court\u2019s reading of the Act severely diminishes\n\u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s role. See supra, at 10\u201312. My position in no\nway tugs against the principle underlying \u00a7109(a)\u2014i.e.,\nthat certain conduct by the copyright owner exhausts the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nStates with the copyright owner\u2019s permission, not when it is distributed\nabroad. But under \u00a7109(a), as interpreted in Quality King, any author\u00ad\nized distribution of a U. S.-made copy, even a distribution occurring in\na foreign country, exhausts the copyright owner\u2019s distribution right\nunder \u00a7106(3). See 523 U. S., at 145, n. 14. Section 109(a) therefore\nprovides for exhaustion in a circumstance not reached by Bobbs-Merrill.\n   21 Section 41 of the 1909 Act provided: \u201c[N]othing in this Act shall be\n\ndeemed to forbid, prevent, or restrict the transfer of any copy of a\ncopyrighted work the possession of which has been lawfully obtained.\u201d\n35 Stat. 1084.

Id., at 11\u201313.24\n   Limiting \u00a7109(c) to U. S.-made works, however, does not\nbar art museums from lawfully displaying works made in\nother countries. Museums can, of course, seek the copy\u00ad\nright owner\u2019s permission to display a work. Furthermore,\nthe sale of a work of art to a U. S. museum may carry with\nit an implied license to publicly display the work. See 2\nPatry \u00a75:131, at 5\u2013280 (\u201c[C]ourts have noted the potential\navailability of an implied nonexclusive licens[e] when the\ncircumstances . . . demonstrate that the parties intended\nthat the work would be used for a specific purpose.\u201d).\nDisplaying a work of art as part of a museum exhibition\nmight also qualify as a \u201cfair use\u201d under 17 U. S. C. \u00a7107.\nCf. Bouchat v. Baltimore Ravens Ltd. Partnership, 619\nF. 3d 301, 313\u2013316 (CA4 2010) (display of copyrighted logo\nin museum-like exhibition constituted \u201cfair use\u201d).\n   The Court worries about the resale of foreign-made\nconsumer goods \u201ccontain[ing] copyrightable software pro\u00ad\ngrams or packaging.\u201d Ante, at 21. For example, the Court\nobserves that a car might be programmed with diverse\nforms of software, the copyrights to which might be\nowned by individuals or entities other than the manu-\nfacturer of the car. Ibid. Must a car owner, the Court\nasks, obtain permission from all of these various copyright\nowners before reselling her car? Ibid. Although this\nquestion strays far from the one presented in this case and\nbriefed by the parties, principles of fair use and implied\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  24 The word \u201ccopy,\u201d as it appears in \u00a7109(c), applies to the original of a\n\nwork of art because the Copyright Act defines the term \u201ccopies\u201d to\n\u201cinclud[e] the material object . . . in which the work is first fixed.\u201d \u00a7101.\n30           KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nlicense (to the extent that express licenses do not exist)\nwould likely permit the car to be resold without the copy\u00ad\nright owners\u2019 authorization.25\n   Most telling in this regard, no court, it appears, has\nbeen called upon to answer any of the Court\u2019s \u201chorribles\u201d\nin an actual case. Three decades have passed since a\nfederal court first published an opinion reading \u00a7109(a) as\napplicable exclusively to copies made in the United States.\nSee Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

Yet\nKirtsaeng and his supporting amici cite not a single case\nin which the owner of a consumer good authorized for sale\nin the United States has been sued for copyright infringe\u00ad\nment after reselling the item or giving it away as a gift or\nto charity. The absence of such lawsuits is unsurprising.\nRoutinely suing one\u2019s customers is hardly a best business\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  25 Principlesof fair use and implied license may also allow a U. S.\ntourist \u201cwho buys a copyrighted work of art, a poster, or . . . a bumper\nsticker\u201d abroad to publicly \u201cdisplay it in America without the copyright\nowner\u2019s further authorization.\u201d Ante, at 15. (The tourist could lawfully\nbring the work of art, poster, or bumper sticker into the United States\nunder 17 U. S. C. \u00a7602(a)(3)(B), which provides that \u00a7602(a)(1)\u2019s impor\u00ad\ntation ban does not apply to \u201cimportation . . . by any person arriving\nfrom outside the United States . . . with respect to copies . . . forming\npart of such person\u2019s personal baggage.\u201d). Furthermore, an individual\nclearly would not incur liability for infringement merely by displaying a\nforeign-made poster or other artwork in her home. See \u00a7106(5) (grant\u00ad\ning the owners of copyrights in \u201cliterary, musical, dramatic, and chore\u00ad\nographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural\nworks\u201d the exclusive right \u201cto display the copyrighted work publicly\u201d\n(emphasis added)).

Cf. 2 Nimmer\n\u00a78.14[C][1], at 8\u2013192.2(1) (\u201c[A] performance limited to members of\nthe family and invited guests is not a public performance.\u201d (footnote\nomitted)).\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

Manufacturers may also insist that soft-\nware programmers agree to contract terms barring such\nlawsuits.\n  The Court provides a different explanation for the\nabsence of the untoward consequences predicted in its\nopinion\u2014namely, that lower court decisions regarding the\nscope of \u00a7109(a)\u2019s first sale prescription have not been\nuniform. Ante, at 23. Uncertainty generated by these\nconflicting decisions, the Court notes, may have deterred\nsome copyright owners from pressing infringement claims.\nAnte, at 23\u201324. But if, as the Court suggests, there are a\nmultitude of copyright owners champing at the bit to bring\nlawsuits against libraries, art museums, and consumers in\nan effort to exercise perpetual control over the down\u00ad\nstream distribution and public display of foreign-made\ncopies, might one not expect that at least a handful of such\nlawsuits would have been filed over the past 30 years?\nThe absence of such suits indicates that the \u201cpractical\nproblems\u201d hypothesized by the Court are greatly exagger\u00ad\nated. Ante, at 24.27 They surely do not warrant disregard\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  26 Exerting extensive control over secondary markets may not always\n\nbe in a manufacturer\u2019s best interest. Carmakers, for example, often\ntrumpet the resale value of their vehicles. See, e.g., Nolan, UD grad\nleads Cadillac marketing, Dayton Daily News, Apr. 2, 2009, p. A8\n(\u201cCadillac plays up its warranty coverage and reliable resale value to\nprospective customers.\u201d). If the transaction costs of reselling vehicles\nwere to rise, consumers\u2019 perception of a new car\u2019s value, and thus the\nprice they are willing to pay for such a car, might fall\u2014an outcome\nhardly favorable to automobile manufacturers.\n  27 It should not be overlooked that the ability to prevent importation\n\nof foreign-made copies encourages copyright owners such as Wiley to\noffer copies of their works at reduced prices to consumers in less devel\u00ad\noped countries who might otherwise be unable to afford them. The\nCourt\u2019s holding, however, prevents copyright owners from barring the\nimportation of such low-priced copies into the United States, where\nthey will compete with the higher priced editions copyright owners\n32          KIRTSAENG v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ning Congress\u2019 intent, expressed in \u00a7602(a)(1), to grant\ncopyright owners the authority to bar the importation of\nforeign-made copies of their works. Cf. Hartford Under-\nwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U. S. 1,\n6 (2000) (\u201c[W]hen the statute\u2019s language is plain, the sole\nfunction of the courts\u2014at least where the disposition\nrequired by the text is not absurd\u2014is to enforce it accord\u00ad\ning to its terms.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                               VI\n  To recapitulate, the objective of statutory interpretation\nis \u201cto give effect to the intent of Congress.\u201d American\nTrucking Assns., 310 U. S., at 542. Here, two congres-\nsional aims are evident. First, in enacting \u00a7602(a)(1), Con-\ngress intended to grant copyright owners permission to\nsegment international markets by barring the importation\nof foreign-made copies into the United States. Second, as\ncodification of the first sale doctrine underscores, Congress\ndid not want the exclusive distribution right conferred in\n\u00a7106(3) to be boundless. Instead of harmonizing these\nobjectives, the Court subordinates the first entirely to the\nsecond. It is unsurprising that none of the three major\ntreatises on U. S. copyright law embrace the Court\u2019s con\u00ad\nstruction of \u00a7109(a). See 2 Nimmer \u00a78.12[B][6][c], at\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nmake available for sale in this country. To protect their profit margins\nin the U. S. market, copyright owners may raise prices in less devel\u00ad\noped countries or may withdraw from such markets altogether.

Such an outcome would disserve consumers\u2014and\nespecially students\u2014in developing nations and would hardly advance\nthe \u201cAmerican foreign policy goals\u201d of supporting education and eco\u00ad\nnomic development in such countries.
