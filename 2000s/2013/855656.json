Argued December 3, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2013*\nThe Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge\n  Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants\n  are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the\n  United States. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1362(12). One of the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) implementing regulations, the\n  Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges\n  are point sources. 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1). These discharges require\n  NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision ex-\n  empts them from coverage. One such statutory provision exempts\n  \u201cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater,\u201d 33 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71342(p)(1), unless the discharge is \u201cassociated with industrial activ-\n  ity,\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B). Under the EPA\u2019s Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n  the term \u201cassociated with industrial activity\u201d covers only discharges\n  \u201cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\n  water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or\n  raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\u201d 40 CFR\n  \u00a7122.26(b)(14). Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the\n  EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial\n  Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement ap-\n  plies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel wash-\n  ing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the\n  Silvicultural Rule.\n     Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to har-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u2013347, Georgia-Pacific West, Inc., et al. v.\nNorthwest Environmental Defense Center, also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2      DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                         CENTER\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\n    vest timber from a state forest. When it rains, water runs off two\n    logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels\n    that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams. The dis-\n    charges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence\n    shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Re-\n    spondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed\n    suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials,\n    including petitioner Decker, invoking the Act\u2019s citizen-suit provision,\n    33 U. S. C. \u00a71365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained\n    NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Ore-\n    gon rivers. The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\n    state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required be-\n    cause the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of\n    pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule. The Ninth Circuit\n    reversed. It held that the conveyances were point sources under the\n    Silvicultural Rule. It also concluded that the discharges were \u201casso-\n    ciated with industrial activity\u201d under the Industrial Stormwater\n    Rule, despite the EPA\u2019s contrary conclusion that the regulation ex-\n    cludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.\n    Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the\n    NPDES permitting scheme.\nHeld:\n    1. A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions,\n \u00a71369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit. That provision is the\n exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency deci-\n sions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issu-\n ance of permits. It does not bar a district court from entertaining a\n citizen suit under \u00a71365 when the suit is against an alleged violator\n and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regula-\n tions. The present action falls within the scope of \u00a71365. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    2. The EPA\u2019s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule\n does not make the cases moot. A live controversy continues to exist\n regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful dis-\n charges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.\n That version governed petitioners\u2019 past discharges, which might be\n the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those\n types of discharges will not require a permit. These cases thus re-\n main live and justiciable. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesa-\n peake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64\u201365. The fact that the\n District Court might rule that NEDC\u2019s arguments lack merit, or that\n relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the\n cases moot. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    3. The preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n as permissibly construed by the EPA, exempts discharges of chan-\n                     Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  neled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the NPDES permit-\n  ting scheme. The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the\n  statutory term \u201cassociated with industrial activity,\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B),\n  and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges\n  at issue here. When an agency interprets its own regulation, the\n  Court, as a general rule, defers to it \u201cunless that interpretation is\n  \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d Chase Bank\n  USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519\n  U. S. 452, 461). Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that\n  the conveyances at issue are \u201cdirectly related\u201d only to the harvesting\n  of raw materials, rather than to \u201cmanufacturing, processing, or raw\n  materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\u201d              40 CFR\n  \u00a7122.26(b)(14). The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open\n  the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to tradi-\n  tional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and\n  other relatively fixed facilities.\n     Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPA\u2019s interpreta-\n  tion is that there is no indication that the agency\u2019s current view is a\n  change from prior practice or is a post hoc justification adopted in re-\n  sponse to litigation. See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n  567 U. S. ___, ___. Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view\n  that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.\n  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with\n  respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads. In exercising the\n  broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater\n  runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further fed-\n  eral regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of\n  Oregon\u2019s extensive rules on the subject.

Under the statute and its implementing\nregulations, a permit is required if the discharges are\ndeemed to be \u201cassociated with industrial activity.\u201d 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71342(p)(2)(B). The Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), with the responsibility to enforce the Act,\nhas issued a regulation defining the term \u201cassociated with\nindustrial activity\u201d to cover only discharges \u201cfrom any\nconveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\nwater and that is directly related to manufacturing, pro-\ncessing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial\n2   DECKER v.

The EPA interprets\nits regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges\nfrom logging roads at issue here. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 24\u201327. For reasons now to be\nexplained, the Court concludes the EPA\u2019s determination is\na reasonable interpretation of its own regulation; and, in\nconsequence, deference is accorded to the interpretation\nunder Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997).\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972 to \u201crestore\nand maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integ-\nrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71251(a). A central provision of the Act is its require-\nment that individuals, corporations, and governments se-\ncure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permits before discharging pollution from any\npoint source into the navigable waters of the United\nStates. See \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1362(12); EPA v. California ex rel.\nState Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205\n(1976). The Act defines \u201cpoint source\u201d as\n    \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, in-\n    cluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\n    tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, roll-\n    ing stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or\n    vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants\n    are or may be discharged. This term does not include\n    agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows\n    from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n  When the Act took effect, the EPA found it difficult to\nprocess permit applications from countless owners and\noperators of point sources throughout the country. The\nagency issued regulations exempting certain types of\npoint-source discharges from the NPDES permitting\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme, but in 1977 those directives were found invalid.\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nruled that the statute did not give the EPA \u201cauthority to\nexempt categories of point sources from the permit re-\nquirements\u201d of the Act. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc. v. Costle, 568 F. 2d 1369, 1377. In response the\nEPA issued new regulations to define with more precision\nwhich categories of discharges qualified as point sources in\nthe first place. Among these regulations was the so-called\nSilvicultural Rule. This rule is at issue here. It provides:\n     \u201cSilvicultural point source means any discernible,\n    confined and discrete conveyance related to rock\n    crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage\n    facilities which are operated in connection with silvi-\n    cultural activities and from which pollutants are dis-\n    charged into waters of the United States. The term\n    does not include non-point source silvicultural activi-\n    ties such as nursery operations, site preparation,\n    reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,\n    thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control,\n    harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road con-\n    struction and maintenance from which there is natu-\n    ral runoff.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1).\n  Under the quoted rule, any discharge from a logging-\nrelated source that qualifies as a point source requires an\nNPDES permit unless some other federal statutory provi-\nsion exempts it from that coverage. In one such provision,\n33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p), Congress has exempted certain dis-\ncharges of stormwater runoff. The statutory exemptions\nwere considered necessary because, from the outset, the\nEPA had encountered recurring difficulties in determining\nhow best to manage discharges of this kind. See, e.g.,\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 966 F. 2d\n1292, 1295\u20131296 (CA9 1992). In 1987, Congress responded\nto these problems and adopted various stormwater-related\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\namendments to the Act. \u00a7405, 101 Stat. 69, 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71342(p).\n   The 1987 amendments exempt from the NPDES permit-\nting scheme most \u201cdischarges composed entirely of storm-\nwater.\u201d \u00a71342(p)(1). The general exemption, however, does\nnot extend to all stormwater discharges. As relevant here,\nCongress directed the EPA to continue to require per-\nmits for stormwater discharges \u201cassociated with indus-\ntrial activity.\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B). The statute does not define\nthat term, but the EPA adopted a regulation (hereinafter\nIndustrial Stormwater Rule) in which it defined it as\n    \u201cthe discharge from any conveyance that is used for\n    collecting and conveying storm water and that is\n    directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw\n    materials storage areas at an industrial plant. The\n    term does not include discharges from facilities or ac-\n    tivities excluded from the NPDES program under this\n    part 122. For the categories of industries identified\n    in this section, the term includes, but is not limited\n    to, storm water discharges from . . . immediate access\n    roads and rail lines used or traveled by carriers of raw\n    materials, manufactured products, waste material, or\n    by-products used or created by the facility . . . .\u201d 40\n    CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006).\n   The Industrial Stormwater Rule also specified that, with\none exception not relevant here, \u201c[f ]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24\u201d are \u201cconsidered\nto be engaging in \u2018industrial activity\u2019 for purposes of para-\ngraph (b)(14).\u201d Ibid.

The amendment was the agency\u2019s response to the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 ruling now under review. The amended\nversion seeks to clarify the types of facilities within\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 that are deemed to\nbe engaged in industrial activity for purposes of the rule.\nThe amended Industrial Stormwater Rule does not cover\nall facilities within Standard Industrial Classification 24.\nIt limits covered stormwater discharges to\n    \u201c[f ]acilities classified within Standard Industrial Clas-\n    sification 24, Industry Group 241 that are rock crushing,\n    gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage facilities\n    operated in connection with silvicultural activities\n    . . . and Industry Groups 242 through 249.\u201d 77 Fed.\n    Reg. 72974, pt. 122, subpt.

NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n(rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log stor-\nage facilities) that are defined as point sources by the\nexplicit terms of the Silvicultural Rule.\n  Up to this stage in the litigation, of course, the cases\nhave been concerned with the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nbefore the amendment adopted on November 30, 2012.\nThe amended regulation will determine whether from this\npoint forward NPDES permits will be required for the\nstormwater discharges at issue. The parties disagree\nabout the significance of the amended rule for purposes of\nthese cases. Before reaching this and other preliminary\npoints, however, it is appropriate to set forth the facts and\nhistory of the cases leading to the proceedings in this\nCourt.\n                             B\n  At issue are discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nfrom two logging roads in Oregon\u2019s Tillamook State For-\nest, lying in the Pacific Coast Range about 40 miles west\nof Portland. Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West, along with\nother logging and paper-products companies, has a con-\ntract with the State of Oregon to harvest timber from the\nforest. It uses the roads for that purpose. When it rains\n(which it does often in the mountains of northwest Oregon,\naveraging in some areas more than 100 inches per year),\nwater runs off the graded roads into a system of ditches,\nculverts, and channels that discharge the water into\nnearby rivers and streams. The discharges often contain\nlarge amounts of sediment, in the form of dirt and crushed\ngravel from the roads. There is evidence that this runoff\ncan harm fish and other aquatic organisms.\n  In September 2006, respondent Northwest Environmen-\ntal Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. It invoked the\nClean Water Act\u2019s citizen-suit provision, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71365,\nand named as defendants certain firms involved in log-\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nging and paper-products operations (including petitioner\nGeorgia-Pacific West), as well as state and local govern-\nments and officials (including the State Forester of Oregon,\nwho is now petitioner Doug Decker). The suit alleged that\nthe defendants caused discharges of channeled stormwater\nrunoff into two waterways\u2014the South Fork Trask River\nand the Little South Fork Kilchis River. The defendants\nhad not obtained NPDES permits, and so, the suit alleged,\nthey had violated the Act.\n  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\nstate a claim. It concluded that NPDES permits were not\nrequired because the ditches, culverts, and channels were\nnot point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvi-\ncultural Rule. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed. Northwest Environmental Defense Center v.\nBrown, 640 F. 3d 1063 (2011). It relied upon three princi-\npal propositions. First, it held that the District Court had\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under \u00a71365 notwithstanding\na different provision of the Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71369(b)(1),\nlimiting judicial review of EPA regulations. Second, the\nCourt of Appeals held that while the EPA\u2019s Silvicultural\nRule is ambiguous on the question whether the convey-\nances at issue are point sources, those conveyances must\nbe deemed point sources under the rule in order to give\neffect to the Act\u2019s expansive definition of the term. Third,\nthe Court of Appeals held that because the Industrial\nStormwater Rule makes cross-reference to Standard In-\ndustrial Classification 24, the discharges at issue are\n\u201cassociated with industrial activity\u201d within the meaning\nof the regulation, despite the EPA\u2019s conclusion to the con-\ntrary. The regulation was held to be unambiguous on this\npoint. The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the dis-\ncharges were from point sources and not exempt from the\nNPDES permitting scheme by the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. It followed that petitioners had been in violation of\nthe Act.\n8     DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n\n                         CENTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\n    This Court granted certiorari. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Before proceeding to the merits, it is necessary to con-\nsider two jurisdictional questions.\n                              A\n   Respondent NEDC invoked the jurisdiction of the Dis-\ntrict Court under 33 U. S. C. \u00a71365(a), which \u201cauthorize[s]\nprivate enforcement of the provisions of [the Clean Water\nAct]\u201d and its implementing regulations. Department of\nEnergy v. Ohio, 503 U. S. 607, 613, n. 5 (1992). Petition-\ners, however, maintain that this suit is barred by a sepa-\nrate provision of the Act, \u00a71369(b). That statute provides\nfor \u201cjudicial review in the United States courts of appeals\nof various particular actions by the [EPA] Administrator,\nincluding establishment of effluent standards and issu-\nance of permits for discharge of pollutants.\u201d Middlesex\nCounty Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers\nAssn., 453 U. S. 1, 13\u201314 (1981). Where that review is\navailable, it is the exclusive means of challenging actions\ncovered by the statute, \u00a71369(b)(2), and an application for\nreview must be lodged in the court of appeals within 120\ndays of the Administrator\u2019s action, \u00a71369(b)(1).\n   The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the exclu-\nsive jurisdiction mandate is not applicable in this suit.\nSection 1369(b) extends only to certain suits challenging\nsome agency actions. It does not bar a district court from\nentertaining a citizen suit under \u00a71365 when the suit is\nagainst an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obliga-\ntion imposed by the Act or its regulations.\n   The present action is within the scope of \u00a71365. It is a\nclaim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of\nthe Silvicultural Rule. The rule is ambiguous: Its charac-\nterization of silvicultural harvesting operations \u201cfrom\nwhich there is natural runoff,\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1), as a\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnonpoint source might be read, as petitioners contend, to\napply to the channeled stormwater runoff at issue; or it\nmight be read, as respondent NEDC urges, to apply only\nto runoff not collected in channels or other engineered\nimprovements. See New Oxford American Dictionary\n1167 (3d ed. 2010) (Oxford Dict.) (\u201cnatural\u201d means \u201cexisting\nin or caused by nature; not made or caused by human-\nkind\u201d). NEDC\u2019s reading would make the channeled dis-\ncharges here point-source pollution under the Act. In its\nview only this interpretation can be squared with the Act\u2019s\nbroad definition of \u201cpoint source.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(14).\nOn this premise, the instant suit is an effort not to chal-\nlenge the Silvicultural Rule but to enforce it under a\nproper interpretation. It is a basic tenet that \u201cregulations,\nin order to be valid, must be consistent with the statute\nunder which they are promulgated.\u201d United States v.\nLarionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 873 (1977).\n   For jurisdictional purposes, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether NEDC is correct in arguing that only its\nreading of the Silvicultural Rule is permitted under the\nAct. It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to\nadopt a \u201cpurposeful but permissible reading of the regula-\ntion . . . to bring it into harmony with . . . the statute.\u201d\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 573 (2007). NEDC does not seek \u201can implicit declara-\ntion that the . . . regulations were invalid as written.\u201d\nIbid. And, as a result, \u00a71369(b) is not a jurisdictional bar\nto this suit.\n                             B\n  \u201cIt is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable\ncase or controversy must remain extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d\nUnited States v.

NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EPA\u2019s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule makes the cases moot. In a supplemental brief filed\nafter oral argument, petitioner Decker, joined by the\nUnited States as amicus curiae, takes the position that the\nrecent amendment makes these cases moot in relevant part.\nSee Supp. Brief for Petitioners in No. 11\u2013338, pp. 4\u20136;\nSupp. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4\u20138.\n   That conclusion is incorrect. \u201cA case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d Knox v. Service\nEmployees Int\u2019l, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, despite the\nrecent amendment, a live controversy continues to exist\nregarding whether petitioners may be held liable for un-\nlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Indus-\ntrial Stormwater Rule.\n   Respondent NEDC continues to press its claim that\npetitioners\u2019 discharges are unlawful under both the\namended regulation and the earlier version. See Supp.\nBrief for Respondent 3\u201313. The instant cases provide no\noccasion to interpret the amended regulation. \u201c \u2018[W]e are a\ncourt of review, not of first view.\u2019 \u201d Arkansas Game and\nFish Comm\u2019n v. United States, ante, at 13 (quoting Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)). The parties,\nhowever, have litigated the suit extensively based on the\nearlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule; and\nthat version governed petitioners\u2019 past discharges, which\nmight be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if,\nin the future, those types of discharges will not require a\npermit.\n   If the Court of Appeals is correct that petitioners were\nobligated to secure NPDES permits before discharging\nchanneled stormwater runoff, the District Court might\norder some remedy for their past violations. The Act\ncontemplates civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day, 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71319(d), as well as attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

NEDC, in addition, requests injunctive\nrelief for both past and ongoing violations, in part in the\nform of an order that petitioners incur certain environmental-\nremediation costs to alleviate harms attributable to\ntheir past discharges. Under these circumstances, the\ncases remain live and justiciable, for the possibility of\nsome remedy for a proven past violation is real and not\nremote. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake\nBay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64\u201365 (1987). The\nDistrict Court, it is true, might rule that NEDC\u2019s argu-\nments lack merit, or that the relief it seeks is not warranted\non the facts of these cases. That possibility, however, does\nnot make the cases moot. \u201cThere may be jurisdiction and\nyet an absence of merits.\u201d General Investment Co. v.\nNew York Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 228, 230 (1926).\n                             III\n   The substantive question of the necessity for an NPDES\npermit under the earlier rule now must be addressed.\nUnder the Act, petitioners were required to secure NPDES\npermits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nonly if the discharges were \u201cassociated with industrial\nactivity,\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p)(2)(B), as that statutory term\nis defined in the preamendment version of the Industrial\nStormwater Rule, 40 CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006). Other-\nwise, the discharges fall within the Act\u2019s general exemp-\ntion of \u201cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater\u201d from\nthe NPDES permitting scheme. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p)(1).\n   NEDC first contends that the statutory term \u201cassociated\nwith industrial activity\u201d unambiguously covers discharges\nof channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013843 (1984). That view, however,\noverlooks the multiple definitions of the terms \u201cindus-\ntrial\u201d and \u201cindustry.\u201d These words can refer to business\nactivity in general, yet so too can they be limited to \u201ceco-\n12   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnomic activity concerned with the processing of raw mate-\nrials and manufacture of goods in factories.\u201d Oxford Dict.\n887. The latter definition does not necessarily encompass\noutdoor timber harvesting. The statute does not foreclose\nmore specific definition by the agency, since it provides no\nfurther detail as to its intended scope.\n   Somewhat more plausible is NEDC\u2019s claim that the\npreamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nunambiguously required a permit for the discharges at\nissue. NEDC reasons that under the rule, \u201c[f]or the cate-\ngories of industries identified in this section,\u201d NPDES\npermits are required for, among other things, \u201cstorm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials.\u201d            40 CFR\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006). Yet this raises the question wheth-\ner logging is a \u201ccategor[y] of industr[y]\u201d identified by the\nsection. The regulation goes on to identify a list of \u201ccate-\ngories of facilities\u201d that \u201care considered to be engaging in\n\u2018industrial activity\u2019 for purposes\u201d of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. Ibid. In the earlier version of the regulation,\nthis list included \u201c[f]acilities classified as Standard Indus-\ntrial Classificatio[n] 24,\u201d which encompasses \u201cLogging.\u201d\nIbid. See also supra, at 4\u20135. Hence, NEDC asserts, log-\nging is among the categories of industries for which \u201cstorm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials\u201d required NPDES\npermits under the earlier version of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. \u00a7122.26(b)(14). NEDC further notes, in sup-\nport of its reading of the regulation, that modern logging is\na large-scale, highly mechanized enterprise, using sophis-\nticated harvesting machines weighing up to 20 tons. See\nBrief for Respondent 4\u20135.\n   The EPA takes a different view. It concludes that the\nearlier regulation invoked Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntion 24 \u201c \u2018to regulate traditional industrial sources such\nas sawmills.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n24\u201325. It points to the regulation\u2019s reference to \u201cfacilities\u201d\nand the classification\u2019s reference to \u201cestablishments,\u201d\nwhich suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent\nthan outdoor timber-harvesting operations. Ibid. See also\n55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48008 (1990). This reading is re-\ninforced by the Industrial Stormwater Rule\u2019s definition\nof discharges associated with industrial activity as dis-\ncharges \u201cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting\nand conveying storm water and that is directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006).\nThis language lends support to the EPA\u2019s claim that the\nregulation does not cover temporary, outdoor logging\ninstallations. It was reasonable for the agency to conclude\nthat the conveyances at issue are \u201cdirectly related\u201d only to\nthe harvesting of raw materials, rather than to \u201cmanufac-\nturing,\u201d \u201cprocessing,\u201d or \u201craw materials storage areas.\u201d\nSee Oxford Dict. 1066 (manufacturing is \u201cmak[ing] (some-\nthing) on a large scale using machinery\u201d); id., at 1392\n(processing is \u201cperform[ing] a series of mechanical or\nchemical operations on (something) in order to change or\npreserve it\u201d). In addition, even if logging as a general\nmatter is a type of economic activity within the regula-\ntion\u2019s scope, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation\ncould still require the discharges to be related in a direct\nway to operations \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d in order to be\nsubject to NPDES permitting.\n   NEDC resists this conclusion, noting that elsewhere in\nthe Industrial Stormwater Rule the EPA has required\nNPDES permits for stormwater discharges associated\nwith other types of outdoor economic activity.            See\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14)(iii) (mining); \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(v) (landfills\nreceiving industrial waste); \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(x) (large con-\nstruction sites). The EPA reasonably could conclude,\nhowever, that these types of activities tend to be more\nfixed and permanent than timber-harvesting operations\n14   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nare and have a closer connection to traditional industrial\nsites. In light of the language of the regulation just dis-\ncussed, moreover, the inclusion of these types of economic\nactivity in the Industrial Stormwater Rule need not be\nread to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to\nthese activities fall within the rule, just as the inclusion of\nlogging need not be read to extend to all discharges from\nlogging sites. The regulation\u2019s reach may be limited by\nthe requirement that the discharges be \u201cdirectly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14).\n   It is well established that an agency\u2019s interpretation\nneed not be the only possible reading of a regulation\u2014or\neven the best one\u2014to prevail. When an agency interprets\nits own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it\n\u201cunless that interpretation is \u2018plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.\nMcCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 461). The EPA\u2019s interpretation is\na permissible one. Taken together, the regulation\u2019s ref-\nerences to \u201cfacilities,\u201d \u201cestablishments,\u201d \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d\n\u201cprocessing,\u201d and an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d leave open the\nrational interpretation that the regulation extends only to\ntraditional industrial buildings such as factories and\nassociated sites, as well as other relatively fixed facilities.\n   There is another reason to accord Auer deference to the\nEPA\u2019s interpretation: there is no indication that its cur-\nrent view is a change from prior practice or a post hoc\njustification adopted in response to litigation. See Chris-\ntopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 10). The opposite is the case. The\nagency has been consistent in its view that the types of\ndischarges at issue here do not require NPDES permits.\n   The EPA\u2019s decision exists against a background of state\nregulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging\nroads. The State of Oregon has made an extensive effort\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto develop a comprehensive set of best practices to manage\nstormwater runoff from logging roads. These practices\ninclude rules mandating filtration of stormwater runoff\nbefore it enters rivers and streams, Ore. Admin. Rule 629\u2013\n625\u20130330(4) (2012); requiring logging companies to con-\nstruct roads using surfacing that minimizes the sediment\nin runoff, Rule 629\u2013625\u20130700(2); and obligating firms to\ncease operations where such efforts fail to prevent vis-\nible increases in water turbidity, Rule 629\u2013625\u20130700(3).\nOregon has invested substantial time and money in estab-\nlishing these practices. In addition, the development,\nsiting, maintenance, and regulation of roads\u2014and in\nparticular of state forest roads\u2014are areas in which Ore-\ngon has considerable expertise. In exercising the broad\ndiscretion the Clean Water Act gives the EPA in the realm\nof stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have\nconcluded that further federal regulation in this area\nwould be duplicative or counterproductive. Indeed, Con-\ngress has given express instructions to the EPA to work\n\u201cin consultation with State and local officials\u201d to alleviate\nstormwater pollution by developing the precise kind of\nbest management practices Oregon has established here.\n33 U.

In that case, however, the agency\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the rule was also the fairest one, and no party had\nasked us to reconsider Auer. Today, however, the Court\u2019s\ndeference to the agency makes the difference (note the\nCourt\u2019s defensive insistence that the agency\u2019s interpreta-\ntion need not be \u201cthe best one,\u201d ante, at 14). And respon-\ndent has asked us, if necessary, to \u201c \u2018reconsider Auer.\u2019 \u201d I\nbelieve that it is time to do so. See Brief for Respondent\n42, n. 12; see also Brief for Law Professors on the Propri-\nety of Administrative Deference as Amici Curiae. This is\nespecially true because the circumstances of these cases\nillustrate Auer\u2019s flaws in a particularly vivid way.\n   The canonical formulation of Auer deference is that we\nwill enforce an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules\nunless that interpretation is \u201cplainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.\u201d Seminole Rock, supra, at 414.\nBut of course whenever the agency\u2019s interpretation of the\nregulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that\nsense \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the regulation. Obviously, that\nis not enough, or there would be nothing for Auer to do. In\npractice, Auer deference is Chevron deference applied to\nregulations rather than statutes. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). The agency\u2019s interpretation will be accepted if,\nthough not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a\nplausible reading\u2014within the scope of the ambiguity that\nthe regulation contains.\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justifica-\ntion for Auer deference. The first case to apply it, Semi-\nnole Rock, offered no justification whatever\u2014just the ipse\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

S., at 414. Our\nlater cases provide two principal explanations, neither of\nwhich has much to be said for it. See generally Stephen-\nson & Pogoriler, Seminole Rock\u2019s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1454\u20131458 (2011). First, some cases say\nthat the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some\nspecial insight into its intent when enacting it. E.g.,\nMartin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm\u2019n, 499 U. S. 144, 150\u2013153 (1991). The implied\npremise of this argument\u2014that what we are looking for is\nthe agency\u2019s intent in adopting the rule\u2014is false. There is\ntrue of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice\nHolmes put it: \u201c[w]e do not inquire what the legislature\nmeant; we ask only what the statute means.\u201d The Theory\nof Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899).\nWhether governing rules are made by the national legisla-\nture or an administrative agency, we are bound by what\nthey say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who\nmade them.\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency\npossesses special expertise in administering its \u201c \u2018complex\nand highly technical regulatory program.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g.,\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512\n(1994). That is true enough, and it leads to the conclu-\nsion that agencies and not courts should make regula-\ntions. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret\nregulations\u2014unless one believes that the purpose of inter-\npretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion\nthat the current leadership of the agency deems effective.\nMaking regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\nrulemaking, in which the agency uses its \u201cspecial exper-\ntise\u201d to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of inter-\npretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule\u2014to\n\u201csay what the law is,\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n177 (1803). Not to make policy, but to determine what\npolicy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to\nwhich the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leader-\nship of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agen-\ncies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency\nhead can only be sure that the application of his \u201cspecial\nexpertise\u201d to the issue addressed by a regulation will be\ngiven effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual\ninterpretation rather than defer to the \u201cspecial expertise\u201d\nof his successors. If we take agency enactments as writ-\nten, the Executive has a stable background against which\nto write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks\nbest.\n   Another conceivable justification for Auer deference,\nthough not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it\nis reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of\nstatutes that Congress enacted, as we do per Chevron, it is\na fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the mean-\ning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an\nagency less control over the meaning of its own regula-\ntions than it has over the meaning of a congressionally\nenacted statute seems quite odd.\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of Chevron (take it or\nleave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority\nto administer a statute, including authority to issue in-\nterpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a\ndegree of discretion, which the courts must respect, re-\ngarding the meaning of the statute. See Smiley v. Citi-\nbank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741 (1996).\nWhile the implication of an agency power to clarify the\nstatute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congres-\nsional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities\nin its own regulations. For that would violate a funda-\nmental principle of separation of powers\u2014that the power\nto write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest\nin the same hands. \u201cWhen the legislative and executive\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

XI, ch. 6, pp. 151\u2013152 (O. Piest ed., T.\nNugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own\npower through Chevron\u2014whatever it leaves vague in the\nstatute will be worked out by someone else. Chevron rep-\nresents a presumption about who, as between the Execu-\ntive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The\nExecutive, by the way\u2014the competing political branch\u2014is\nthe less congenial repository of the power as far as Con-\ngress is concerned.) So Congress\u2019s incentive is to speak as\nclearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules\u2014that is\nsomething else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented\nby the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak\nvaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \u201cflexibility\u201d that\nwill enable \u201cclarification\u201d with retroactive effect. \u201cIt is per-\nfectly understandable\u201d for an agency to \u201cissue vague regula-\ntions\u201d if doing so will \u201cmaximiz[e] agency power.\u201d Thomas\nJefferson Univ., supra, at 525 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nCombining the power to prescribe with the power to inter-\npret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice\nof resolving doubts about \u201cthe construction of the Roman\nlaws\u201d by \u201cstat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and\ntak[ing] his opinion upon it.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 58 (1765). And our Consti-\ntution did not mirror the British practice of using the\nHouse of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the\nfear that he who has \u201cagency in passing bad laws\u201d might\noperate in the \u201csame spirit\u201d in their interpretation. The\nFederalist No. 81, pp. 543\u2013544 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Auer\ndeference encourages agencies to be \u201cvague in framing\nregulations, with the plan of issuing \u2018interpretations\u2019 to\ncreate the intended new law without observance of notice\n6    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\nand comment procedures.\u201d Anthony, The Supreme Court\nand the APA: Sometimes They Just Don\u2019t Get It, 10 Ad-\nmin. L. J. Am. U. 1, 11\u201312 (1996). Auer is not a logical\ncorollary to Chevron but a dangerous permission slip for\nthe arrogation of power. See Talk America, 564 U. S., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\u20133); Manning,\nConstitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency\nInterpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612\n(1996).\n   It is true enough that Auer deference has the same\nbeneficial pragmatic effect as Chevron deference: The\ncountry need not endure the uncertainty produced by\ndivergent views of numerous district courts and courts of\nappeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation,\nuntil a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by\nthis Court. The agency\u2019s view can be relied upon, unless it\nis, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the\nuncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as\nlong as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For\nas soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is\npronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the\nprocess of amending the regulation to make its meaning\nentirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate\nthe point. While these cases were being briefed before us,\nEPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of\nAppeals judgment we are reviewing. See 77 Fed. Reg.\n72974 (2012) (to be codified in 40 CFR pt. 122, sub pt. B).\nIt did so (by the standards of such things) relatively\nquickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011,\nand in December 2012 the EPA published an amended\nrule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it ar-\ngues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\nChevron-type deference has less severe pragmatic conse-\nquences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when\nan agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the\ntext arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

That is not possible, of course, when, as\nhere, a party harmed by the violation has standing to\ncompel enforcement.\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains\nderived from Auer deference, beneficial effect cannot jus-\ntify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contra-\nvenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He\nwho writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n                              II\n   I would therefore resolve these cases by using the famil-\niar tools of textual interpretation to decide: Is what the\npetitioners did here proscribed by the fairest reading of\nthe regulations? What they did was to channel storm-\nwater runoff from logging roads without a permit. To\ndecide whether that was permissible we must answer one,\nand possibly two, questions: First, was the stormwater\ndischarged from a \u201cpoint source\u201d? If not, no permit was\nrequired. But if so, we face the second question: Were the\nstormwater discharges exempt from the permit require-\nment because they were not \u201cassociated with industrial\nactivity\u201d? The fairest reading of the statute and regula-\ntions is that these discharges were from point sources, and\nwere associated with industrial activity.\n                              A\n  The Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharging\npollution without a permit from what it calls a \u201cpoint\nsource.\u201d 33 U.

In EPA\u2019s view, the stormwater here is \u201cnatu-\nral runoff.\u201d\n   But are stormwater discharges \u201cnatural runoff \u201d when\nthey are channeled through manmade pipes and ditches,\nand carry with them manmade pollutants from manmade\nforest roads?

The forest roads at\nissue here are used to transport raw material (logs); the\nonly question is whether logging is a \u201ccategor[y] of in-\ndustr[y]\u201d enumerated in the definition.

Opening one\u2019s hymnal to Standard\nIndustrial Classification 24 (\u201cLumber and Wood Products,\nExcept Furniture\u201d), one finds that the first industry group\nlisted, No. 2411, is \u201cLogging\u201d\u2014defined as \u201c[e]stablish-\nments primarily engaged in cutting timber.\u201d 2 App. 64.\n(As if that were not clear enough, an illustrative product of\nthis industry is helpfully listed: \u201cLogs.\u201d) That, I would\nthink, is that.\n   EPA disagrees, and the Court gives the agency\u2019s posi-\ntion Auer deference, but that reading is certainly not the\nmost natural one. The Court relies heavily on the fact\nthat the definition of \u201c[s]torm water discharge associ-\nated with industrial activity\u201d requires that the discharge\nbe \u201cdirectly related to manufacturing, processing or\nraw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,\u201d\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14). The crucial question this definition pre-\nsents is whether the concluding phrase \u201cat an industrial\nplant\u201d limits only the last noun phrase (\u201craw materials\nstorage areas\u201d) or also the two preceding nouns (\u201cmanufac-\nturing\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d). The canon of interpretation\nknown as the rule of the last antecedent states that \u201ca\nlimiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as\nmodifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately\n10   DECKER v.

If\na statute provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful to possess a\ngrenade launcher, a fully-automatic weapon, or a shotgun\nwith a barrel shorter than 12 inches,\u201d that does not mean\nthat a grenade launcher with a barrel longer than 12\ninches is legal. Application of the canon would mean that\n\u201cat an industrial plant\u201d modifies only \u201craw materials\nstorage areas,\u201d and therefore that \u201cmanufacturing\u201d and\n\u201cprocessing\u201d anywhere, including in the forest, would be\n\u201cassociated with industrial activity.\u201d (Standard Industrial\nClassification 24 categorizes logging as a manufacturing\nbusiness, and these discharges are therefore \u201cdirectly\nrelated to manufacturing.\u201d)\n   Like all canons of interpretation, the rule of the last\nantecedent can be overcome by textual indication of\ncontrary meaning. But that does not exist here. To the\ncontrary, the enumerated categories of industries to\nwhich the term \u201cindustrial activity\u201d applies reinforce the\nproposition that \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d does not\nmodify \u201cmanufacturing\u201d or \u201cprocessing.\u201d The term in-\ncludes (in addition to logging) \u201cactive or inactive mining\noperations,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(iii); \u201c[l]andfills\u201d and \u201copen\ndumps,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(v); \u201cautomobile junkyards,\u201d\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14)(vi); and \u201c[c]onstruction activity including\nclearing, grading and excavation,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(x).\nThose industries and activities (while related to manufac-\nturing and processing) virtually never take place at any-\nthing like what one might describe as a \u201cplant.\u201d The rule\nof the last antecedent is therefore confirmed as the correct\nguide to meaning here: \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d limits only\n\u201craw materials storage areas.\u201d\n   EPA also insists, Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24, that the regulation reaches only \u201c \u2018traditional\u2019 \u201d\nsources of industrial stormwater, such as sawmills.

Argued December 3, 2012\u2014Decided March 20, 2013*\nThe Clean Water Act (Act) requires that National Pollutant Discharge\n  Elimination System (NPDES) permits be secured before pollutants\n  are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the\n  United States. See 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1362(12). One of the Envi-\n  ronmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) implementing regulations, the\n  Silvicultural Rule, specifies which types of logging-related discharges\n  are point sources. 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1). These discharges require\n  NPDES permits unless some other federal statutory provision ex-\n  empts them from coverage. One such statutory provision exempts\n  \u201cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater,\u201d 33 U. S. C.\n  \u00a71342(p)(1), unless the discharge is \u201cassociated with industrial activ-\n  ity,\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B). Under the EPA\u2019s Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n  the term \u201cassociated with industrial activity\u201d covers only discharges\n  \u201cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\n  water and that is directly related to manufacturing, processing or\n  raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\u201d 40 CFR\n  \u00a7122.26(b)(14). Shortly before oral argument in the instant cases, the\n  EPA issued a final version of an amendment to the Industrial\n  Stormwater Rule, clarifying that the NPDES permit requirement ap-\n  plies only to logging operations involving rock crushing, gravel wash-\n  ing, log sorting, and log storage facilities, which are all listed in the\n  Silvicultural Rule.\n     Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West has a contract with Oregon to har-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * Together with No. 11\u2013347, Georgia-Pacific West, Inc., et al. v.\nNorthwest Environmental Defense Center, also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.\n2      DECKER v.

When it rains, water runs off two\n    logging roads used by petitioner into ditches, culverts, and channels\n    that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams. The dis-\n    charges often contain large amounts of sediment, which evidence\n    shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. Re-\n    spondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center (NEDC) filed\n    suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials,\n    including petitioner Decker, invoking the Act\u2019s citizen-suit provision,\n    33 U. S. C. \u00a71365, and alleging that the defendants had not obtained\n    NPDES permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two Ore-\n    gon rivers. The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\n    state a claim, concluding that NPDES permits were not required be-\n    cause the ditches, culverts, and channels were not point sources of\n    pollution under the Act and the Silvicultural Rule. The Ninth Circuit\n    reversed. It held that the conveyances were point sources under the\n    Silvicultural Rule. It also concluded that the discharges were \u201casso-\n    ciated with industrial activity\u201d under the Industrial Stormwater\n    Rule, despite the EPA\u2019s contrary conclusion that the regulation ex-\n    cludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.\n    Thus, the court held, the discharges were not exempt from the\n    NPDES permitting scheme.\nHeld:\n    1. A provision of the Act governing challenges to agency actions,\n \u00a71369(b), is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit. That provision is the\n exclusive vehicle for suits seeking to invalidate certain agency deci-\n sions, such as the establishment of effluent standards and the issu-\n ance of permits. It does not bar a district court from entertaining a\n citizen suit under \u00a71365 when the suit is against an alleged violator\n and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regula-\n tions. The present action falls within the scope of \u00a71365. Pp. 8\u20139.\n    2. The EPA\u2019s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater Rule\n does not make the cases moot. A live controversy continues to exist\n regarding whether petitioners may be held liable for unlawful dis-\n charges under the earlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule.\n That version governed petitioners\u2019 past discharges, which might be\n the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, those\n types of discharges will not require a permit. These cases thus re-\n main live and justiciable. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesa-\n peake Bay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64\u201365. The fact that the\n District Court might rule that NEDC\u2019s arguments lack merit, or that\n relief is not warranted on the facts of these cases, does not make the\n cases moot. Pp. 9\u201311.\n    3. The preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule,\n as permissibly construed by the EPA, exempts discharges of chan-\n                     Cite as: 568 U.

The regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the\n  statutory term \u201cassociated with industrial activity,\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B),\n  and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges\n  at issue here. When an agency interprets its own regulation, the\n  Court, as a general rule, defers to it \u201cunless that interpretation is\n  \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d Chase Bank\n  USA, N. A. v. McCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (quoting Auer v. Robbins, 519\n  U. S. 452, 461). Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that\n  the conveyances at issue are \u201cdirectly related\u201d only to the harvesting\n  of raw materials, rather than to \u201cmanufacturing, processing, or raw\n  materials storage areas at an industrial plant.\u201d              40 CFR\n  \u00a7122.26(b)(14). The regulatory scheme, taken as a whole, leaves open\n  the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to tradi-\n  tional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and\n  other relatively fixed facilities.\n     Another reason to accord Auer deference to the EPA\u2019s interpreta-\n  tion is that there is no indication that the agency\u2019s current view is a\n  change from prior practice or is a post hoc justification adopted in re-\n  sponse to litigation. See Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n  567 U. S. ___, ___. Rather, the EPA has been consistent in its view\n  that the types of discharges at issue do not require NPDES permits.\n  Its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with\n  respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads. In exercising the\n  broad discretion the Act gives the EPA in the realm of stormwater\n  runoff, the agency could reasonably have concluded that further fed-\n  eral regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of\n  Oregon\u2019s extensive rules on the subject.

The Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA), with the responsibility to enforce the Act,\nhas issued a regulation defining the term \u201cassociated with\nindustrial activity\u201d to cover only discharges \u201cfrom any\nconveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm\nwater and that is directly related to manufacturing, pro-\ncessing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial\n2   DECKER v.

The EPA interprets\nits regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges\nfrom logging roads at issue here. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 24\u201327. For reasons now to be\nexplained, the Court concludes the EPA\u2019s determination is\na reasonable interpretation of its own regulation; and, in\nconsequence, deference is accorded to the interpretation\nunder Auer v. Robbins, 519 U. S. 452, 461 (1997).\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n   Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972 to \u201crestore\nand maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integ-\nrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C.\n\u00a71251(a). A central provision of the Act is its require-\nment that individuals, corporations, and governments se-\ncure National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System\n(NPDES) permits before discharging pollution from any\npoint source into the navigable waters of the United\nStates. See \u00a7\u00a71311(a), 1362(12); EPA v. California ex rel.\nState Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205\n(1976). The Act defines \u201cpoint source\u201d as\n    \u201cany discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, in-\n    cluding but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel,\n    tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, roll-\n    ing stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or\n    vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants\n    are or may be discharged. This term does not include\n    agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows\n    from irrigated agriculture.\u201d \u00a71362(14).\n  When the Act took effect, the EPA found it difficult to\nprocess permit applications from countless owners and\noperators of point sources throughout the country. The\nagency issued regulations exempting certain types of\npoint-source discharges from the NPDES permitting\n                 Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme, but in 1977 those directives were found invalid.\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\nruled that the statute did not give the EPA \u201cauthority to\nexempt categories of point sources from the permit re-\nquirements\u201d of the Act. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc. v. Costle, 568 F. 2d 1369, 1377. In response the\nEPA issued new regulations to define with more precision\nwhich categories of discharges qualified as point sources in\nthe first place. Among these regulations was the so-called\nSilvicultural Rule. This rule is at issue here. It provides:\n     \u201cSilvicultural point source means any discernible,\n    confined and discrete conveyance related to rock\n    crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage\n    facilities which are operated in connection with silvi-\n    cultural activities and from which pollutants are dis-\n    charged into waters of the United States. The term\n    does not include non-point source silvicultural activi-\n    ties such as nursery operations, site preparation,\n    reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,\n    thinning, prescribed burning, pest and fire control,\n    harvesting operations, surface drainage, or road con-\n    struction and maintenance from which there is natu-\n    ral runoff.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1).\n  Under the quoted rule, any discharge from a logging-\nrelated source that qualifies as a point source requires an\nNPDES permit unless some other federal statutory provi-\nsion exempts it from that coverage. In one such provision,\n33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p), Congress has exempted certain dis-\ncharges of stormwater runoff. The statutory exemptions\nwere considered necessary because, from the outset, the\nEPA had encountered recurring difficulties in determining\nhow best to manage discharges of this kind. See, e.g.,\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, 966 F. 2d\n1292, 1295\u20131296 (CA9 1992). In 1987, Congress responded\nto these problems and adopted various stormwater-related\n4    DECKER v.

C.\n\u00a71342(p).\n   The 1987 amendments exempt from the NPDES permit-\nting scheme most \u201cdischarges composed entirely of storm-\nwater.\u201d \u00a71342(p)(1). The general exemption, however, does\nnot extend to all stormwater discharges. As relevant here,\nCongress directed the EPA to continue to require per-\nmits for stormwater discharges \u201cassociated with indus-\ntrial activity.\u201d \u00a71342(p)(2)(B). The statute does not define\nthat term, but the EPA adopted a regulation (hereinafter\nIndustrial Stormwater Rule) in which it defined it as\n    \u201cthe discharge from any conveyance that is used for\n    collecting and conveying storm water and that is\n    directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw\n    materials storage areas at an industrial plant. The\n    term does not include discharges from facilities or ac-\n    tivities excluded from the NPDES program under this\n    part 122. For the categories of industries identified\n    in this section, the term includes, but is not limited\n    to, storm water discharges from . . . immediate access\n    roads and rail lines used or traveled by carriers of raw\n    materials, manufactured products, waste material, or\n    by-products used or created by the facility . . . .\u201d 40\n    CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006).\n   The Industrial Stormwater Rule also specified that, with\none exception not relevant here, \u201c[f ]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classificatio[n] 24\u201d are \u201cconsidered\nto be engaging in \u2018industrial activity\u2019 for purposes of para-\ngraph (b)(14).\u201d Ibid.

The amendment was the agency\u2019s response to the\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 ruling now under review. The amended\nversion seeks to clarify the types of facilities within\nStandard Industrial Classification 24 that are deemed to\nbe engaged in industrial activity for purposes of the rule.\nThe amended Industrial Stormwater Rule does not cover\nall facilities within Standard Industrial Classification 24.\nIt limits covered stormwater discharges to\n    \u201c[f ]acilities classified within Standard Industrial Clas-\n    sification 24, Industry Group 241 that are rock crushing,\n    gravel washing, log sorting, or log storage facilities\n    operated in connection with silvicultural activities\n    . . . and Industry Groups 242 through 249.\u201d 77 Fed.\n    Reg. 72974, pt. 122, subpt.

The parties disagree\nabout the significance of the amended rule for purposes of\nthese cases. Before reaching this and other preliminary\npoints, however, it is appropriate to set forth the facts and\nhistory of the cases leading to the proceedings in this\nCourt.\n                             B\n  At issue are discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nfrom two logging roads in Oregon\u2019s Tillamook State For-\nest, lying in the Pacific Coast Range about 40 miles west\nof Portland. Petitioner Georgia-Pacific West, along with\nother logging and paper-products companies, has a con-\ntract with the State of Oregon to harvest timber from the\nforest. It uses the roads for that purpose. When it rains\n(which it does often in the mountains of northwest Oregon,\naveraging in some areas more than 100 inches per year),\nwater runs off the graded roads into a system of ditches,\nculverts, and channels that discharge the water into\nnearby rivers and streams. The discharges often contain\nlarge amounts of sediment, in the form of dirt and crushed\ngravel from the roads. There is evidence that this runoff\ncan harm fish and other aquatic organisms.\n  In September 2006, respondent Northwest Environmen-\ntal Defense Center (NEDC) filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Oregon. It invoked the\nClean Water Act\u2019s citizen-suit provision, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71365,\nand named as defendants certain firms involved in log-\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

The suit alleged that\nthe defendants caused discharges of channeled stormwater\nrunoff into two waterways\u2014the South Fork Trask River\nand the Little South Fork Kilchis River. The defendants\nhad not obtained NPDES permits, and so, the suit alleged,\nthey had violated the Act.\n  The District Court dismissed the action for failure to\nstate a claim. It concluded that NPDES permits were not\nrequired because the ditches, culverts, and channels were\nnot point sources of pollution under the Act and the Silvi-\ncultural Rule. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed. Northwest Environmental Defense Center v.\nBrown, 640 F. 3d 1063 (2011). It relied upon three princi-\npal propositions. First, it held that the District Court had\nsubject-matter jurisdiction under \u00a71365 notwithstanding\na different provision of the Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a71369(b)(1),\nlimiting judicial review of EPA regulations. Second, the\nCourt of Appeals held that while the EPA\u2019s Silvicultural\nRule is ambiguous on the question whether the convey-\nances at issue are point sources, those conveyances must\nbe deemed point sources under the rule in order to give\neffect to the Act\u2019s expansive definition of the term. Third,\nthe Court of Appeals held that because the Industrial\nStormwater Rule makes cross-reference to Standard In-\ndustrial Classification 24, the discharges at issue are\n\u201cassociated with industrial activity\u201d within the meaning\nof the regulation, despite the EPA\u2019s conclusion to the con-\ntrary. The regulation was held to be unambiguous on this\npoint. The Court of Appeals thus ruled that the dis-\ncharges were from point sources and not exempt from the\nNPDES permitting scheme by the Industrial Stormwater\nRule. It followed that petitioners had been in violation of\nthe Act.\n8     DECKER v.

That statute provides\nfor \u201cjudicial review in the United States courts of appeals\nof various particular actions by the [EPA] Administrator,\nincluding establishment of effluent standards and issu-\nance of permits for discharge of pollutants.\u201d Middlesex\nCounty Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers\nAssn., 453 U. S. 1, 13\u201314 (1981). Where that review is\navailable, it is the exclusive means of challenging actions\ncovered by the statute, \u00a71369(b)(2), and an application for\nreview must be lodged in the court of appeals within 120\ndays of the Administrator\u2019s action, \u00a71369(b)(1).\n   The Court of Appeals was correct to rule that the exclu-\nsive jurisdiction mandate is not applicable in this suit.\nSection 1369(b) extends only to certain suits challenging\nsome agency actions. It does not bar a district court from\nentertaining a citizen suit under \u00a71365 when the suit is\nagainst an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obliga-\ntion imposed by the Act or its regulations.\n   The present action is within the scope of \u00a71365. It is a\nclaim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of\nthe Silvicultural Rule. The rule is ambiguous: Its charac-\nterization of silvicultural harvesting operations \u201cfrom\nwhich there is natural runoff,\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.27(b)(1), as a\n                 Cite as: 568 U.

See New Oxford American Dictionary\n1167 (3d ed. 2010) (Oxford Dict.) (\u201cnatural\u201d means \u201cexisting\nin or caused by nature; not made or caused by human-\nkind\u201d). NEDC\u2019s reading would make the channeled dis-\ncharges here point-source pollution under the Act. In its\nview only this interpretation can be squared with the Act\u2019s\nbroad definition of \u201cpoint source.\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71362(14).\nOn this premise, the instant suit is an effort not to chal-\nlenge the Silvicultural Rule but to enforce it under a\nproper interpretation. It is a basic tenet that \u201cregulations,\nin order to be valid, must be consistent with the statute\nunder which they are promulgated.\u201d United States v.\nLarionoff, 431 U. S. 864, 873 (1977).\n   For jurisdictional purposes, it is unnecessary to deter-\nmine whether NEDC is correct in arguing that only its\nreading of the Silvicultural Rule is permitted under the\nAct. It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to\nadopt a \u201cpurposeful but permissible reading of the regula-\ntion . . . to bring it into harmony with . . . the statute.\u201d\nEnvironmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp., 549 U. S.\n561, 573 (2007). NEDC does not seek \u201can implicit declara-\ntion that the . . . regulations were invalid as written.\u201d\nIbid. And, as a result, \u00a71369(b) is not a jurisdictional bar\nto this suit.\n                             B\n  \u201cIt is a basic principle of Article III that a justiciable\ncase or controversy must remain extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d\nUnited States v.

NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n                   Opinion of the Court\n\nthe EPA\u2019s recent amendment to the Industrial Stormwater\nRule makes the cases moot. In a supplemental brief filed\nafter oral argument, petitioner Decker, joined by the\nUnited States as amicus curiae, takes the position that the\nrecent amendment makes these cases moot in relevant part.\nSee Supp. Brief for Petitioners in No. 11\u2013338, pp. 4\u20136;\nSupp. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4\u20138.\n   That conclusion is incorrect. \u201cA case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d Knox v. Service\nEmployees Int\u2019l, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, despite the\nrecent amendment, a live controversy continues to exist\nregarding whether petitioners may be held liable for un-\nlawful discharges under the earlier version of the Indus-\ntrial Stormwater Rule.\n   Respondent NEDC continues to press its claim that\npetitioners\u2019 discharges are unlawful under both the\namended regulation and the earlier version. See Supp.\nBrief for Respondent 3\u201313. The instant cases provide no\noccasion to interpret the amended regulation. \u201c \u2018[W]e are a\ncourt of review, not of first view.\u2019 \u201d Arkansas Game and\nFish Comm\u2019n v. United States, ante, at 13 (quoting Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005)). The parties,\nhowever, have litigated the suit extensively based on the\nearlier version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule; and\nthat version governed petitioners\u2019 past discharges, which\nmight be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if,\nin the future, those types of discharges will not require a\npermit.\n   If the Court of Appeals is correct that petitioners were\nobligated to secure NPDES permits before discharging\nchanneled stormwater runoff, the District Court might\norder some remedy for their past violations. The Act\ncontemplates civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day, 33\nU. S. C. \u00a71319(d), as well as attorney\u2019s fees for prevailing\n                  Cite as: 568 U.

NEDC, in addition, requests injunctive\nrelief for both past and ongoing violations, in part in the\nform of an order that petitioners incur certain environmental-\nremediation costs to alleviate harms attributable to\ntheir past discharges. Under these circumstances, the\ncases remain live and justiciable, for the possibility of\nsome remedy for a proven past violation is real and not\nremote. See Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Chesapeake\nBay Foundation, Inc., 484 U. S. 49, 64\u201365 (1987). The\nDistrict Court, it is true, might rule that NEDC\u2019s argu-\nments lack merit, or that the relief it seeks is not warranted\non the facts of these cases. That possibility, however, does\nnot make the cases moot. \u201cThere may be jurisdiction and\nyet an absence of merits.\u201d General Investment Co. v.\nNew York Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 228, 230 (1926).\n                             III\n   The substantive question of the necessity for an NPDES\npermit under the earlier rule now must be addressed.\nUnder the Act, petitioners were required to secure NPDES\npermits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff\nonly if the discharges were \u201cassociated with industrial\nactivity,\u201d 33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p)(2)(B), as that statutory term\nis defined in the preamendment version of the Industrial\nStormwater Rule, 40 CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006). Other-\nwise, the discharges fall within the Act\u2019s general exemp-\ntion of \u201cdischarges composed entirely of stormwater\u201d from\nthe NPDES permitting scheme. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71342(p)(1).\n   NEDC first contends that the statutory term \u201cassociated\nwith industrial activity\u201d unambiguously covers discharges\nof channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U. S. 837, 842\u2013843 (1984). That view, however,\noverlooks the multiple definitions of the terms \u201cindus-\ntrial\u201d and \u201cindustry.\u201d These words can refer to business\nactivity in general, yet so too can they be limited to \u201ceco-\n12   DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                        CENTER\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nnomic activity concerned with the processing of raw mate-\nrials and manufacture of goods in factories.\u201d Oxford Dict.\n887. The latter definition does not necessarily encompass\noutdoor timber harvesting. The statute does not foreclose\nmore specific definition by the agency, since it provides no\nfurther detail as to its intended scope.\n   Somewhat more plausible is NEDC\u2019s claim that the\npreamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule\nunambiguously required a permit for the discharges at\nissue. NEDC reasons that under the rule, \u201c[f]or the cate-\ngories of industries identified in this section,\u201d NPDES\npermits are required for, among other things, \u201cstorm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials.\u201d            40 CFR\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006). Yet this raises the question wheth-\ner logging is a \u201ccategor[y] of industr[y]\u201d identified by the\nsection. The regulation goes on to identify a list of \u201ccate-\ngories of facilities\u201d that \u201care considered to be engaging in\n\u2018industrial activity\u2019 for purposes\u201d of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. Ibid. In the earlier version of the regulation,\nthis list included \u201c[f]acilities classified as Standard Indus-\ntrial Classificatio[n] 24,\u201d which encompasses \u201cLogging.\u201d\nIbid. See also supra, at 4\u20135. Hence, NEDC asserts, log-\nging is among the categories of industries for which \u201cstorm\nwater discharges from . . . immediate access roads . . . used\nor traveled by carriers of raw materials\u201d required NPDES\npermits under the earlier version of the Industrial Storm-\nwater Rule. \u00a7122.26(b)(14). NEDC further notes, in sup-\nport of its reading of the regulation, that modern logging is\na large-scale, highly mechanized enterprise, using sophis-\nticated harvesting machines weighing up to 20 tons. See\nBrief for Respondent 4\u20135.\n   The EPA takes a different view. It concludes that the\nearlier regulation invoked Standard Industrial Classifica-\ntion 24 \u201c \u2018to regulate traditional industrial sources such\nas sawmills.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n24\u201325. It points to the regulation\u2019s reference to \u201cfacilities\u201d\nand the classification\u2019s reference to \u201cestablishments,\u201d\nwhich suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent\nthan outdoor timber-harvesting operations. Ibid. See also\n55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 48008 (1990). This reading is re-\ninforced by the Industrial Stormwater Rule\u2019s definition\nof discharges associated with industrial activity as dis-\ncharges \u201cfrom any conveyance that is used for collecting\nand conveying storm water and that is directly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.\u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.26(b)(14) (2006).\nThis language lends support to the EPA\u2019s claim that the\nregulation does not cover temporary, outdoor logging\ninstallations. It was reasonable for the agency to conclude\nthat the conveyances at issue are \u201cdirectly related\u201d only to\nthe harvesting of raw materials, rather than to \u201cmanufac-\nturing,\u201d \u201cprocessing,\u201d or \u201craw materials storage areas.\u201d\nSee Oxford Dict. 1066 (manufacturing is \u201cmak[ing] (some-\nthing) on a large scale using machinery\u201d); id., at 1392\n(processing is \u201cperform[ing] a series of mechanical or\nchemical operations on (something) in order to change or\npreserve it\u201d). In addition, even if logging as a general\nmatter is a type of economic activity within the regula-\ntion\u2019s scope, a reasonable interpretation of the regulation\ncould still require the discharges to be related in a direct\nway to operations \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d in order to be\nsubject to NPDES permitting.\n   NEDC resists this conclusion, noting that elsewhere in\nthe Industrial Stormwater Rule the EPA has required\nNPDES permits for stormwater discharges associated\nwith other types of outdoor economic activity.            See\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14)(iii) (mining); \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(v) (landfills\nreceiving industrial waste); \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(x) (large con-\nstruction sites). The EPA reasonably could conclude,\nhowever, that these types of activities tend to be more\nfixed and permanent than timber-harvesting operations\n14   DECKER v.

In light of the language of the regulation just dis-\ncussed, moreover, the inclusion of these types of economic\nactivity in the Industrial Stormwater Rule need not be\nread to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to\nthese activities fall within the rule, just as the inclusion of\nlogging need not be read to extend to all discharges from\nlogging sites. The regulation\u2019s reach may be limited by\nthe requirement that the discharges be \u201cdirectly related to\nmanufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas\nat an industrial plant.\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14).\n   It is well established that an agency\u2019s interpretation\nneed not be the only possible reading of a regulation\u2014or\neven the best one\u2014to prevail. When an agency interprets\nits own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it\n\u201cunless that interpretation is \u2018plainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.\u2019 \u201d Chase Bank USA, N. A. v.\nMcCoy, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting\nAuer, 519 U. S., at 461). The EPA\u2019s interpretation is\na permissible one. Taken together, the regulation\u2019s ref-\nerences to \u201cfacilities,\u201d \u201cestablishments,\u201d \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d\n\u201cprocessing,\u201d and an \u201cindustrial plant\u201d leave open the\nrational interpretation that the regulation extends only to\ntraditional industrial buildings such as factories and\nassociated sites, as well as other relatively fixed facilities.\n   There is another reason to accord Auer deference to the\nEPA\u2019s interpretation: there is no indication that its cur-\nrent view is a change from prior practice or a post hoc\njustification adopted in response to litigation. See Chris-\ntopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 10). The opposite is the case. The\nagency has been consistent in its view that the types of\ndischarges at issue here do not require NPDES permits.\n   The EPA\u2019s decision exists against a background of state\nregulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging\nroads. The State of Oregon has made an extensive effort\n                  Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto develop a comprehensive set of best practices to manage\nstormwater runoff from logging roads. These practices\ninclude rules mandating filtration of stormwater runoff\nbefore it enters rivers and streams, Ore. Admin. Rule 629\u2013\n625\u20130330(4) (2012); requiring logging companies to con-\nstruct roads using surfacing that minimizes the sediment\nin runoff, Rule 629\u2013625\u20130700(2); and obligating firms to\ncease operations where such efforts fail to prevent vis-\nible increases in water turbidity, Rule 629\u2013625\u20130700(3).\nOregon has invested substantial time and money in estab-\nlishing these practices. In addition, the development,\nsiting, maintenance, and regulation of roads\u2014and in\nparticular of state forest roads\u2014are areas in which Ore-\ngon has considerable expertise. In exercising the broad\ndiscretion the Clean Water Act gives the EPA in the realm\nof stormwater runoff, the agency could reasonably have\nconcluded that further federal regulation in this area\nwould be duplicative or counterproductive. Indeed, Con-\ngress has given express instructions to the EPA to work\n\u201cin consultation with State and local officials\u201d to alleviate\nstormwater pollution by developing the precise kind of\nbest management practices Oregon has established here.\n33 U.

This is\nespecially true because the circumstances of these cases\nillustrate Auer\u2019s flaws in a particularly vivid way.\n   The canonical formulation of Auer deference is that we\nwill enforce an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules\nunless that interpretation is \u201cplainly erroneous or incon-\nsistent with the regulation.\u201d Seminole Rock, supra, at 414.\nBut of course whenever the agency\u2019s interpretation of the\nregulation is different from the fairest reading, it is in that\nsense \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the regulation. Obviously, that\nis not enough, or there would be nothing for Auer to do. In\npractice, Auer deference is Chevron deference applied to\nregulations rather than statutes. See Chevron U. S. A.\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n837 (1984). The agency\u2019s interpretation will be accepted if,\nthough not the fairest reading of the regulation, it is a\nplausible reading\u2014within the scope of the ambiguity that\nthe regulation contains.\n   Our cases have not put forward a persuasive justifica-\ntion for Auer deference. The first case to apply it, Semi-\nnole Rock, offered no justification whatever\u2014just the ipse\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

S., at 414. Our\nlater cases provide two principal explanations, neither of\nwhich has much to be said for it. See generally Stephen-\nson & Pogoriler, Seminole Rock\u2019s Domain, 79 Geo. Wash.\nL. Rev. 1449, 1454\u20131458 (2011). First, some cases say\nthat the agency, as the drafter of the rule, will have some\nspecial insight into its intent when enacting it. E.g.,\nMartin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm\u2019n, 499 U. S. 144, 150\u2013153 (1991). The implied\npremise of this argument\u2014that what we are looking for is\nthe agency\u2019s intent in adopting the rule\u2014is false. There is\ntrue of regulations what is true of statutes. As Justice\nHolmes put it: \u201c[w]e do not inquire what the legislature\nmeant; we ask only what the statute means.\u201d The Theory\nof Legal Interpretation, 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 419 (1899).\nWhether governing rules are made by the national legisla-\nture or an administrative agency, we are bound by what\nthey say, not by the unexpressed intention of those who\nmade them.\n   The other rationale our cases provide is that the agency\npossesses special expertise in administering its \u201c \u2018complex\nand highly technical regulatory program.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g.,\nThomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U. S. 504, 512\n(1994). That is true enough, and it leads to the conclu-\nsion that agencies and not courts should make regula-\ntions. But it has nothing to do with who should interpret\nregulations\u2014unless one believes that the purpose of inter-\npretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion\nthat the current leadership of the agency deems effective.\nMaking regulatory programs effective is the purpose of\nrulemaking, in which the agency uses its \u201cspecial exper-\ntise\u201d to formulate the best rule. But the purpose of inter-\npretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule\u2014to\n\u201csay what the law is,\u201d Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n4    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\n177 (1803). Not to make policy, but to determine what\npolicy has been made and promulgated by the agency, to\nwhich the public owes obedience. Indeed, since the leader-\nship of agencies (and hence the policy preferences of agen-\ncies) changes with Presidential administrations, an agency\nhead can only be sure that the application of his \u201cspecial\nexpertise\u201d to the issue addressed by a regulation will be\ngiven effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual\ninterpretation rather than defer to the \u201cspecial expertise\u201d\nof his successors. If we take agency enactments as writ-\nten, the Executive has a stable background against which\nto write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks\nbest.\n   Another conceivable justification for Auer deference,\nthough not one that is to be found in our cases, is this: If it\nis reasonable to defer to agencies regarding the meaning of\nstatutes that Congress enacted, as we do per Chevron, it is\na fortiori reasonable to defer to them regarding the mean-\ning of regulations that they themselves crafted. To give an\nagency less control over the meaning of its own regula-\ntions than it has over the meaning of a congressionally\nenacted statute seems quite odd.\n   But it is not odd at all. The theory of Chevron (take it or\nleave it) is that when Congress gives an agency authority\nto administer a statute, including authority to issue in-\nterpretive regulations, it implicitly accords the agency a\ndegree of discretion, which the courts must respect, re-\ngarding the meaning of the statute. See Smiley v. Citi-\nbank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741 (1996).\nWhile the implication of an agency power to clarify the\nstatute is reasonable enough, there is surely no congres-\nsional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguities\nin its own regulations. For that would violate a funda-\nmental principle of separation of powers\u2014that the power\nto write a law and the power to interpret it cannot rest\nin the same hands. \u201cWhen the legislative and executive\n                   Cite as: 568 U.

XI, ch. 6, pp. 151\u2013152 (O. Piest ed., T.\nNugent transl. 1949). Congress cannot enlarge its own\npower through Chevron\u2014whatever it leaves vague in the\nstatute will be worked out by someone else. Chevron rep-\nresents a presumption about who, as between the Execu-\ntive and the Judiciary, that someone else will be. (The\nExecutive, by the way\u2014the competing political branch\u2014is\nthe less congenial repository of the power as far as Con-\ngress is concerned.) So Congress\u2019s incentive is to speak as\nclearly as possible on the matters it regards as important.\n   But when an agency interprets its own rules\u2014that is\nsomething else. Then the power to prescribe is augmented\nby the power to interpret; and the incentive is to speak\nvaguely and broadly, so as to retain a \u201cflexibility\u201d that\nwill enable \u201cclarification\u201d with retroactive effect. \u201cIt is per-\nfectly understandable\u201d for an agency to \u201cissue vague regula-\ntions\u201d if doing so will \u201cmaximiz[e] agency power.\u201d Thomas\nJefferson Univ., supra, at 525 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nCombining the power to prescribe with the power to inter-\npret is not a new evil: Blackstone condemned the practice\nof resolving doubts about \u201cthe construction of the Roman\nlaws\u201d by \u201cstat[ing] the case to the emperor in writing, and\ntak[ing] his opinion upon it.\u201d 1 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 58 (1765). And our Consti-\ntution did not mirror the British practice of using the\nHouse of Lords as a court of last resort, due in part to the\nfear that he who has \u201cagency in passing bad laws\u201d might\noperate in the \u201csame spirit\u201d in their interpretation. The\nFederalist No. 81, pp. 543\u2013544 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Auer\ndeference encourages agencies to be \u201cvague in framing\nregulations, with the plan of issuing \u2018interpretations\u2019 to\ncreate the intended new law without observance of notice\n6    DECKER v. NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE\n                              CENTER\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J. \n\n\nand comment procedures.\u201d Anthony, The Supreme Court\nand the APA: Sometimes They Just Don\u2019t Get It, 10 Ad-\nmin. L. J. Am. U. 1, 11\u201312 (1996). Auer is not a logical\ncorollary to Chevron but a dangerous permission slip for\nthe arrogation of power. See Talk America, 564 U. S., at\n___ (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2\u20133); Manning,\nConstitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency\nInterpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612\n(1996).\n   It is true enough that Auer deference has the same\nbeneficial pragmatic effect as Chevron deference: The\ncountry need not endure the uncertainty produced by\ndivergent views of numerous district courts and courts of\nappeals as to what is the fairest reading of the regulation,\nuntil a definitive answer is finally provided, years later, by\nthis Court. The agency\u2019s view can be relied upon, unless it\nis, so to speak, beyond the pale. But the duration of the\nuncertainty produced by a vague regulation need not be as\nlong as the uncertainty produced by a vague statute. For\nas soon as an interpretation uncongenial to the agency is\npronounced by a district court, the agency can begin the\nprocess of amending the regulation to make its meaning\nentirely clear. The circumstances of this case demonstrate\nthe point. While these cases were being briefed before us,\nEPA issued a rule designed to respond to the Court of\nAppeals judgment we are reviewing. See 77 Fed. Reg.\n72974 (2012) (to be codified in 40 CFR pt. 122, sub pt. B).\nIt did so (by the standards of such things) relatively\nquickly: The decision below was handed down in May 2011,\nand in December 2012 the EPA published an amended\nrule setting forth in unmistakable terms the position it ar-\ngues here. And there is another respect in which a lack of\nChevron-type deference has less severe pragmatic conse-\nquences for rules than for statutes. In many cases, when\nan agency believes that its rule permits conduct that the\ntext arguably forbids, it can simply exercise its discretion\n                   Cite as: 568 U. S. ____ (2013)               7\n\n        SCALIA, J., concurring inof SCALIA,dissenting in part\n                        Opinion part and J.\n\nnot to prosecute. That is not possible, of course, when, as\nhere, a party harmed by the violation has standing to\ncompel enforcement.\n   In any case, however great may be the efficiency gains\nderived from Auer deference, beneficial effect cannot jus-\ntify a rule that not only has no principled basis but contra-\nvenes one of the great rules of separation of powers: He\nwho writes a law must not adjudge its violation.\n                              II\n   I would therefore resolve these cases by using the famil-\niar tools of textual interpretation to decide: Is what the\npetitioners did here proscribed by the fairest reading of\nthe regulations? What they did was to channel storm-\nwater runoff from logging roads without a permit. To\ndecide whether that was permissible we must answer one,\nand possibly two, questions: First, was the stormwater\ndischarged from a \u201cpoint source\u201d? If not, no permit was\nrequired. But if so, we face the second question: Were the\nstormwater discharges exempt from the permit require-\nment because they were not \u201cassociated with industrial\nactivity\u201d? The fairest reading of the statute and regula-\ntions is that these discharges were from point sources, and\nwere associated with industrial activity.\n                              A\n  The Clean Water Act generally prohibits discharging\npollution without a permit from what it calls a \u201cpoint\nsource.\u201d 33 U.

In EPA\u2019s view, the stormwater here is \u201cnatu-\nral runoff.\u201d\n   But are stormwater discharges \u201cnatural runoff \u201d when\nthey are channeled through manmade pipes and ditches,\nand carry with them manmade pollutants from manmade\nforest roads?

In my view, giving the term the agency\u2019s\ninterpretation would contradict the statute\u2019s definition of\n\u201cpoint source,\u201d which explicitly includes any \u201cpipe, ditch,\nchannel, tunnel, [and] conduit.\u201d Applying the interpretive\npresumption of validity\u2014the canon that we are to \u201cprefe[r]\nthe meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys,\u201d\nPanama Refining Co. v.

The forest roads at\nissue here are used to transport raw material (logs); the\nonly question is whether logging is a \u201ccategor[y] of in-\ndustr[y]\u201d enumerated in the definition. It is: The second of\nthe listed \u201ccategories of facilities\u201d is \u201c[f]acilities classified\nas Standard Industrial Classifications 24 (except 2434).\u201d\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14)(ii). Opening one\u2019s hymnal to Standard\nIndustrial Classification 24 (\u201cLumber and Wood Products,\nExcept Furniture\u201d), one finds that the first industry group\nlisted, No. 2411, is \u201cLogging\u201d\u2014defined as \u201c[e]stablish-\nments primarily engaged in cutting timber.\u201d 2 App. 64.\n(As if that were not clear enough, an illustrative product of\nthis industry is helpfully listed: \u201cLogs.\u201d) That, I would\nthink, is that.\n   EPA disagrees, and the Court gives the agency\u2019s posi-\ntion Auer deference, but that reading is certainly not the\nmost natural one. The Court relies heavily on the fact\nthat the definition of \u201c[s]torm water discharge associ-\nated with industrial activity\u201d requires that the discharge\nbe \u201cdirectly related to manufacturing, processing or\nraw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,\u201d\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14). The crucial question this definition pre-\nsents is whether the concluding phrase \u201cat an industrial\nplant\u201d limits only the last noun phrase (\u201craw materials\nstorage areas\u201d) or also the two preceding nouns (\u201cmanufac-\nturing\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d). The canon of interpretation\nknown as the rule of the last antecedent states that \u201ca\nlimiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as\nmodifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately\n10   DECKER v.

If\na statute provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful to possess a\ngrenade launcher, a fully-automatic weapon, or a shotgun\nwith a barrel shorter than 12 inches,\u201d that does not mean\nthat a grenade launcher with a barrel longer than 12\ninches is legal. Application of the canon would mean that\n\u201cat an industrial plant\u201d modifies only \u201craw materials\nstorage areas,\u201d and therefore that \u201cmanufacturing\u201d and\n\u201cprocessing\u201d anywhere, including in the forest, would be\n\u201cassociated with industrial activity.\u201d (Standard Industrial\nClassification 24 categorizes logging as a manufacturing\nbusiness, and these discharges are therefore \u201cdirectly\nrelated to manufacturing.\u201d)\n   Like all canons of interpretation, the rule of the last\nantecedent can be overcome by textual indication of\ncontrary meaning. But that does not exist here. To the\ncontrary, the enumerated categories of industries to\nwhich the term \u201cindustrial activity\u201d applies reinforce the\nproposition that \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d does not\nmodify \u201cmanufacturing\u201d or \u201cprocessing.\u201d The term in-\ncludes (in addition to logging) \u201cactive or inactive mining\noperations,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(iii); \u201c[l]andfills\u201d and \u201copen\ndumps,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(v); \u201cautomobile junkyards,\u201d\n\u00a7122.26(b)(14)(vi); and \u201c[c]onstruction activity including\nclearing, grading and excavation,\u201d \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(x).\nThose industries and activities (while related to manufac-\nturing and processing) virtually never take place at any-\nthing like what one might describe as a \u201cplant.\u201d The rule\nof the last antecedent is therefore confirmed as the correct\nguide to meaning here: \u201cat an industrial plant\u201d limits only\n\u201craw materials storage areas.\u201d\n   EPA also insists, Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24, that the regulation reaches only \u201c \u2018traditional\u2019 \u201d\nsources of industrial stormwater, such as sawmills.

I cannot imagine what kind of \u201cfixed and permanent\u201d\nindustrial site the Court and EPA imagine will be \u201cproduc-\ning wood chips in the field.\u201d And the Court\u2019s final point,\nante, at 13\u2014that the regulatory definition of \u201cindustrial\nactivity\u201d uses the word \u201cfacilities\u201d\u2014cuts the other way:\nEPA regulations define \u201cfacility\u201d to include \u201cany . . . \u2018point\nsource.\u2019 \u201d 40 CFR \u00a7122.2; see, e.g., \u00a7122.26(b)(14)(iii) (re-\nferring to mines as \u201cfacilities\u201d).\n   The agency also assures us that its intent (Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 25) was to reach a more\nlimited subset of logging activities, an intent that it be-\nlieves can essentially float free from the text of the rele-\nvant rule.
