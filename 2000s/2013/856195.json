Argued October 31, 2012—Decided March 26, 2013\nPolice took a drug-sniffing dog to Jardines’ front porch, where the dog\n  gave a positive alert for narcotics.

One month later, the Department and the\nDrug Enforcement Administration sent a joint surveillance\nteam to Jardines’ home. Detective Pedraja was part of\nthat team. He watched the home for fifteen minutes and\nsaw no vehicles in the driveway or activity around the\nhome, and could not see inside because the blinds were\ndrawn. Detective Pedraja then approached Jardines’\nhome accompanied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a trained\ncanine handler who had just arrived at the scene with his\ndrug-sniffing dog. The dog was trained to detect the scent\nof marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs,\nindicating the presence of any of these substances through\nparticular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.\n2                  FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash, owing\nin part to the dog’s “wild” nature, App. to Pet. for Cert. A–\n35, and tendency to dart around erratically while search-\ning. As the dog approached Jardines’ front porch, he\napparently sensed one of the odors he had been trained to\ndetect, and began energetically exploring the area for the\nstrongest point source of that odor. As Detective Bartelt\nexplained, the dog “began tracking that airborne odor by\n. . . tracking back and forth,” engaging in what is called\n“bracketing,” “back and forth, back and forth.” Id., at A–\n33 to A–34. Detective Bartelt gave the dog “the full six\nfeet of the leash plus whatever safe distance [he could]\ngive him” to do this—he testified that he needed to give\nthe dog “as much distance as I can.” Id., at A–35. And\nDetective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring, so\nthat he would not “get knocked over” when the dog was\n“spinning around trying to find” the source. Id., at A–38.\n    After sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat,\nwhich is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor’s\nstrongest point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog\naway from the door and returned to his vehicle. He left\nthe scene after informing Detective Pedraja that there had\nbeen a positive alert for narcotics.\n    On the basis of what he had learned at the home, De-\ntective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to\nsearch the residence. When the warrant was executed later\nthat day, Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the\nsearch revealed marijuana plants, and he was charged\nwith trafficking in cannabis.\n    At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana\nplants on the ground that the canine investigation was an\nunreasonable search. The trial court granted the motion,\nand the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed.\nOn a petition for discretionary review, the Florida Su-\npreme Court quashed the decision of the Third District\nCourt of Appeal and approved the trial court’s decision to\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n   The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that\nthe “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated.” The Amendment estab-\nlishes a simple baseline, one that for much of our history\nformed the exclusive basis for its protections: When “the\nGovernment obtains information by physically intruding”\non persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a ‘search’ within\nthe original meaning of the Fourth Amendment” has “un-\ndoubtedly occurred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 3 (2012) (slip op., at 6, n. 3). By reason of\nour decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347\n(1967), property rights “are not the sole measure of Fourth\nAmendment violations,” Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.\n56, 64 (1992)—but though Katz may add to the baseline, it\ndoes not subtract anything from the Amendment’s protec-\ntions “when the Government does engage in [a] physi-\ncal intrusion of a constitutionally protected area,” United\nStates v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment).\n   That principle renders this case a straightforward one.\nThe officers were gathering information in an area belong-\ning to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house—\nin the curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys\nprotection as part of the home itself. And they gathered\nthat information by physically entering and occupying the\n4                  FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narea to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly per-\nmitted by the homeowner.\n                             A\n   The Fourth Amendment “indicates with some precision\nthe places and things encompassed by its protections”:\npersons, houses, papers, and effects. Oliver v. United\nStates, 466 U. S. 170, 176 (1984). The Fourth Amendment\ndoes not, therefore, prevent all investigations conducted\non private property; for example, an officer may (subject to\nKatz) gather information in what we have called “open\nfields”—even if those fields are privately owned—because\nsuch fields are not enumerated in the Amendment’s text.\nHester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).\n   But when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home\nis first among equals. At the Amendment’s “very core”\nstands “the right of a man to retreat into his own home\nand there be free from unreasonable governmental in-\ntrusion.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\n(1961). This right would be of little practical value if the\nState’s agents could stand in a home’s porch or side gar-\nden and trawl for evidence with impunity; the right to\nretreat would be significantly diminished if the police\ncould enter a man’s property to observe his repose from\njust outside the front window.\n   We therefore regard the area “immediately surrounding\nand associated with the home”—what our cases call the\ncurtilage—as “part of the home itself for Fourth Amend-\nment purposes.” Oliver, supra, at 180. That principle has\nancient and durable roots. Just as the distinction between\nthe home and the open fields is “as old as the common\nlaw,” Hester, supra, at 59, so too is the identity of home\nand what Blackstone called the “curtilage or homestall,”\nfor the “house protects and privileges all its branches and\nappurtenants.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 223, 225 (1769). This area around the\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhome is “intimately linked to the home, both physically\nand psychologically,” and is where “privacy expectations\nare most heightened.” California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,\n213 (1986).\n   While the boundaries of the curtilage are generally\n“clearly marked,” the “conception defining the curtilage” is\nat any rate familiar enough that it is “easily understood\nfrom our daily experience.” Oliver, 466 U. S., at 182, n. 12.\nHere there is no doubt that the officers entered it: The\nfront porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to\nthe home and “to which the activity of home life extends.”\nIbid.\n                               B\n   Since the officers’ investigation took place in a constitu-\ntionally protected area, we turn to the question of whether\nit was accomplished through an unlicensed physical in-\ntrusion.1 While law enforcement officers need not “shield\ntheir eyes” when passing by the home “on public thorough-\nfares,” Ciraolo, 476 U. S., at 213, an officer’s leave to\ngather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps\noff those thoroughfares and enters the Fourth Amend-\nment’s protected areas. In permitting, for example, visual\nobservation of the home from “public navigable airspace,”\nwe were careful to note that it was done “in a physically\nnonintrusive manner.” Ibid. Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils.\nK. B. 275, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K. B. 1765), a case “undoubt-\nedly familiar” to “every American statesman” at the time\nof the Founding, Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626\n——————\n   1 At oral argument, the State and its amicus the Solicitor General\n\nargued that Jardines conceded in the lower courts that the officers had\na right to be where they were. This misstates the record. Jardines\nconceded nothing more than the unsurprising proposition that the of-\nficers could have lawfully approached his home to knock on the front\ndoor in hopes of speaking with him. Of course, that is not what they\ndid.\n6                       FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1886), states the general rule clearly: “[O]ur law holds the\nproperty of every man so sacred, that no man can set his\nfoot upon his neighbour’s close without his leave.” 2 Wils.\nK. B., at 291, 95 Eng. Rep., at 817. As it is undisputed\nthat the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of\ntheir companion’s firmly planted on the constitutionally\nprotected extension of Jardines’ home, the only question is\nwhether he had given his leave (even implicitly) for them\nto do so. He had not.\n   “A license may be implied from the habits of the coun-\ntry,” notwithstanding the “strict rule of the English com-\nmon law as to entry upon a close.” McKee v. Gratz, 260\nU. S. 127, 136 (1922) (Holmes, J.). We have accordingly\nrecognized that “the knocker on the front door is treated\nas an invitation or license to attempt an entry, justifying\ningress to the home by solicitors, hawkers and peddlers\nof all kinds.” Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622, 626\n(1951). This implicit license typically permits the visitor\nto approach the home by the front path, knock promptly,\nwait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to\nlinger longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that\ntraditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal\nknowledge; it is generally managed without incident by\nthe Nation’s Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.2 Thus, a\npolice officer not armed with a warrant may approach a\nhome and knock, precisely because that is “no more than\nany private citizen might do.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.\n——————\n    2 With this much, the dissent seems to agree—it would inquire into\n\n“ ‘the appearance of things,’ ” post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.), what is\n“typica[l]” for a visitor, ibid., what might cause “alarm” to a “resident of\nthe premises,” ibid., what is “expected” of “ordinary visitors,” ibid., and\nwhat would be expected from a “ ‘reasonably respectful citizen,’ ” post, at\n7. These are good questions. But their answers are incompatible with\nthe dissent’s outcome, which is presumably why the dissent does not\neven try to argue that it would be customary, usual, reasonable, re-\nspectful, ordinary, typical, nonalarming, etc., for a stranger to explore\nthe curtilage of the home with trained drug dogs.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16).\n   But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area\naround the home in hopes of discovering incriminating\nevidence is something else. There is no customary invita-\ntion to do that. An invitation to engage in canine forensic\ninvestigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of\nhanging a knocker.3 To find a visitor knocking on the door\nis routine (even if sometimes unwelcome); to spot that\nsame visitor exploring the front path with a metal detec-\ntor, or marching his bloodhound into the garden before\nsaying hello and asking permission, would inspire most\nof us to—well, call the police. The scope of a license—\nexpress or implied—is limited not only to a particular area\nbut also to a specific purpose. Consent at a traffic stop to\nan officer’s checking out an anonymous tip that there is a\nbody in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage\nthrough the trunk for narcotics. Here, the background\nsocial norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not\ninvite him there to conduct a search.4\n——————\n   3 The dissent insists that our argument must rest upon “the particu-\n\nlar instrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor of mari-\njuana”—the dog. Post, at 8. It is not the dog that is the problem, but the\nbehavior that here involved use of the dog. We think a typical person\nwould find it “ ‘a cause for great alarm’ ” (the kind of reaction the dis-\nsent quite rightly relies upon to justify its no-night-visits rule, post,\nat 5) to find a stranger snooping about his front porch with or without\na dog. The dissent would let the police do whatever they want by way\nof gathering evidence so long as they stay on the base-path, to use a\nbaseball analogy—so long as they “stick to the path that is typically\nused to approach a front door, such as a paved walkway.” Ibid. From\nthat vantage point they can presumably peer into the house through\nbinoculars with impunity. That is not the law, as even the State con-\ncedes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.\n   4 The dissent argues, citing King, that “gathering evidence—even\n\ndamning evidence—is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the\nlicense to approach.” Post, at 7. That is a false generalization. What\nKing establishes is that it is not a Fourth Amendment search to ap-\nproach the home in order to speak with the occupant, because all are\n8                      FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The State points to our decisions holding that the sub-\njective intent of the officer is irrelevant. See Ashcroft v.\nal-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___ (2011); Whren v. United States, 517\nU. S. 806 (1996). But those cases merely hold that a stop\nor search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by\nthe fact that the officer’s real reason for making the stop\nor search has nothing to do with the validating reason.\nThus, the defendant will not be heard to complain that\nalthough he was speeding the officer’s real reason for the\nstop was racial harassment. See id., at 810, 813. Here,\nhowever, the question before the court is precisely whether\nthe officer’s conduct was an objectively reasonable search.\nAs we have described, that depends upon whether the\nofficers had an implied license to enter the porch, which in\nturn depends upon the purpose for which they entered.\nHere, their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to con-\nduct a search, which is not what anyone would think he\nhad license to do.\n                              III\n   The State argues that investigation by a forensic narcot-\nics dog by definition cannot implicate any legitimate pri-\nvacy interest. The State cites for authority our decisions\nin United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), United\nStates v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109 (1984), and Illinois v.\nCaballes, 543 U. S. 405 (2005), which held, respectively,\nthat canine inspection of luggage in an airport, chemical\ntesting of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in\ntransit, and canine inspection of an automobile during a\nlawful traffic stop, do not violate the “reasonable expecta-\ntion of privacy” described in Katz.\n\n—————— \n\ninvited to do that. The mere “purpose of discovering information,” post,\nat 8, in the course of engaging in that permitted conduct does not cause\nit to violate the Fourth Amendment. But no one is impliedly invited to\nenter the protected premises of the home in order to do nothing but\nconduct a search.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Just last Term, we considered an argument much like\nthis. Jones held that tracking an automobile’s where-\nabouts using a physically-mounted GPS receiver is a Fourth\nAmendment search. The Government argued that the\nKatz standard “show[ed] that no search occurred,” as the\ndefendant had “no ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in\nhis whereabouts on the public roads, Jones, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5)—a proposition with at least as much\nsupport in our case law as the one the State marshals\nhere. See, e.g., United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 278\n(1983). But because the GPS receiver had been physically\nmounted on the defendant’s automobile (thus intruding on\nhis “effects”), we held that tracking the vehicle’s move-\nments was a search: a person’s “Fourth Amendment rights\ndo not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.” Jones,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). The Katz reasonable-\nexpectations test “has been added to, not substituted\nfor,” the traditional property-based understanding of the\nFourth Amendment, and so is unnecessary to consider\nwhen the government gains evidence by physically intrud-\ning on constitutionally protected areas. Jones, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 8).\n   Thus, we need not decide whether the officers’ investiga-\ntion of Jardines’ home violated his expectation of privacy\nunder Katz. One virtue of the Fourth Amendment’s\nproperty-rights baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy.\nThat the officers learned what they learned only by physi-\ncally intruding on Jardines’ property to gather evidence is\nenough to establish that a search occurred.\n   For a related reason we find irrelevant the State’s ar-\ngument (echoed by the dissent) that forensic dogs have\nbeen commonly used by police for centuries. This argu-\nment is apparently directed to our holding in Kyllo v.\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), that surveillance of\nthe home is a search where “the Government uses a device\nthat is not in general public use” to “explore details of the\n10                 FLORIDA v.

A stranger\ncomes to the front door of your home carrying super-high-\npowered binoculars. See ante, at 7, n. 3. He doesn’t knock\nor say hello. Instead, he stands on the porch and uses the\nbinoculars to peer through your windows, into your home’s\nfurthest corners. It doesn’t take long (the binoculars are\nreally very fine): In just a couple of minutes, his uncom-\nmon behavior allows him to learn details of your life you\ndisclose to no one. Has your “visitor” trespassed on your\nproperty, exceeding the license you have granted to mem-\nbers of the public to, say, drop off the mail or distribute\ncampaign flyers? Yes, he has. And has he also invaded\nyour “reasonable expectation of privacy,” by nosing into\nintimacies you sensibly thought protected from disclosure?\nKatz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360 (1967) (Harlan,\nJ., concurring). Yes, of course, he has done that too.\n   That case is this case in every way that matters. Here,\npolice officers came to Joelis Jardines’ door with a super-\nsensitive instrument, which they deployed to detect things\ninside that they could not perceive unassisted. The equip-\nment they used was animal, not mineral. But contra the\ndissent, see post, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (noting the\nubiquity of dogs in American households), that is of no\n2                   FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nsignificance in determining whether a search occurred.\nDetective Bartelt’s dog was not your neighbor’s pet, come\nto your porch on a leisurely stroll. As this Court discussed\nearlier this Term, drug-detection dogs are highly trained\ntools of law enforcement, geared to respond in distinctive\nways to specific scents so as to convey clear and reliable\ninformation to their human partners. See Florida v.\nHarris, 568 U. S. ___ (2013) (slip op. at 2–3, 7–8). They\nare to the poodle down the street as high-powered binocu-\nlars are to a piece of plain glass. Like the binoculars, a\ndrug-detection dog is a specialized device for discovering\nobjects not in plain view (or plain smell). And as in the\nhypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a\nhome—the most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of\nall the places and things the Fourth Amendment protects.\nWas this activity a trespass? Yes, as the Court holds to-\nday. Was it also an invasion of privacy? Yes, that as well.\n   The Court today treats this case under a property ru-\nbric; I write separately to note that I could just as happily\nhave decided it by looking to Jardines’ privacy interests. A\ndecision along those lines would have looked . . . well,\nmuch like this one. It would have talked about “ ‘the right\nof a man to retreat into his own home and there be free\nfrom unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ” Ante, at 4\n(quoting Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\n(1961)). It would have insisted on maintaining the “prac-\ntical value” of that right by preventing police officers from\nstanding in an adjacent space and “trawl[ing] for evidence\nwith impunity.” Ante, at 4. It would have explained that\n“ ‘privacy expectations are most heightened’ ” in the home\nand the surrounding area. Ante, at 4–5 (quoting Califor-\nnia v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986)). And it would\nhave determined that police officers invade those shared\nexpectations when they use trained canine assistants to\nreveal within the confines of a home what they could not\notherwise have found there. See ante, at 6–7, and nn. 2–3.\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                          KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n  It is not surprising that in a case involving a search of a\nhome, property concepts and privacy concepts should so\nalign. The law of property “naturally enough influence[s]”\nour “shared social expectations” of what places should be\nfree from governmental incursions. Georgia v. Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103, 111 (2006); see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S.\n128, 143, n. 12 (1978). And so the sentiment “my home is\nmy own,” while originating in property law, now also\ndenotes a common understanding—extending even beyond\nthat law’s formal protections—about an especially private\nsphere. Jardines’ home was his property; it was also his\nmost intimate and familiar space. The analysis proceed-\ning from each of those facts, as today’s decision reveals,\nruns mostly along the same path.\n  I can think of only one divergence: If we had decided\nthis case on privacy grounds, we would have realized that\nKyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), already re-\nsolved it.1 The Kyllo Court held that police officers con-\nducted a search when they used a thermal-imaging device\nto detect heat emanating from a private home, even\nthough they committed no trespass. Highlighting our\nintention to draw both a “firm” and a “bright” line at “the\nentrance to the house,” id., at 40, we announced the fol-\nlowing rule:\n     “Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is\n     not in general public use, to explore details of the\n     home that would previously have been unknowable\n——————\n   1 The dissent claims, alternatively, that Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S.\n\n405, 409–410 (2005), controls this case (or nearly does). See post, at 9,\n11. But Caballes concerned a drug-detection dog’s sniff of an automo-\nbile during a traffic stop. See also Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. ___\n(2013). And we have held, over and over again, that people’s expecta-\ntions of privacy are much lower in their cars than in their homes. See,\ne.g., Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 345 (2009); Wyoming v. Houghton,\n526 U. S. 295, 303 (1999); New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, 115 (1986);\nCardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583, 590–591 (1974) (plurality opinion).\n4                      FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n       without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a\n       ‘search’ and is presumptively unreasonable without a\n       warrant.” Ibid.\nThat “firm” and “bright” rule governs this case: The police\nofficers here conducted a search because they used a\n“device . . . not in general public use” (a trained drug-\ndetection dog) to “explore details of the home” (the pres-\nence of certain substances) that they would not otherwise\nhave discovered without entering the premises.\n   And again, the dissent’s argument that the device is just\na dog cannot change the equation. As Kyllo made clear,\nthe “sense-enhancing” tool at issue may be “crude” or\n“sophisticated,” may be old or new (drug-detection dogs\nactually go back not “12,000 years” or “centuries,” post, at\n2, 8, 12, but only a few decades), may be either smaller or\nbigger than a breadbox; still, “at least where (as here)” the\ndevice is not “in general public use,” training it on a home\nviolates our “minimal expectation of privacy”—an expecta-\ntion “that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasona-\nble.” 533 U. S., at 34, 36.2 That does not mean the device\n——————\n    2 The\n        dissent’s other principal reason for concluding that no violation\nof privacy occurred in this case—that police officers themselves might\ndetect an aroma wafting from a house—works no better. If officers can\nsmell drugs coming from a house, they can use that information; a\nhuman sniff is not a search, we can all agree. But it does not follow\nthat a person loses his expectation of privacy in the many scents within\nhis home that (his own nose capably tells him) are not usually detecti-\nble by humans standing outside. And indeed, Kyllo already decided as\nmuch. In response to an identical argument from the dissent in that\ncase, see 533 U. S., at 43 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that humans\ncan sometimes detect “heat emanating from a building”), the Kyllo\nCourt stated: “The dissent’s comparison of the thermal imaging to\nvarious circumstances in which outside observers might be able to\nperceive, without technology, the heat of the home . . . is quite irrele-\nvant. The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be ob-\ntained by other means does not make lawful the use of means that\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. . . . In any event, [at the time in\nquestion,] no outside observer could have discerned the relative heat of\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (describing\nexigencies allowing the warrantless search of a home).\n   With these further thoughts, suggesting that a focus on\nJardines’ privacy interests would make an “easy cas[e]\neasy” twice over, ante, at 10, I join the Court’s opinion in\nfull.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nKyllo’s home without thermal imaging.” Id., at 35, n. 2. \n\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

This\nlicense is not limited to persons who intend to speak to an\noccupant or who actually do so. (Mail carriers and persons\ndelivering packages and flyers are examples of individuals\nwho may lawfully approach a front door without intending\nto converse.) Nor is the license restricted to categories\nof visitors whom an occupant of the dwelling is likely to\nwelcome; as the Court acknowledges, this license applies\neven to “solicitors, hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.”\nAnte, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\nlicense even extends to police officers who wish to gather\nevidence against an occupant (by asking potentially in-\ncriminating questions).\n   According to the Court, however, the police officer in\nthis case, Detective Bartelt, committed a trespass because\nhe was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to\nthe front door of respondent’s house by his dog, Franky.\nWhere is the authority evidencing such a rule? Dogs have\n2                     FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbeen domesticated for about 12,000 years;1 they were\nubiquitous in both this country and Britain at the time of\nthe adoption of the Fourth Amendment;2 and their acute\nsense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centu-\nries.3 Yet the Court has been unable to find a single\ncase—from the United States or any other common-law\nnation—that supports the rule on which its decision is\nbased. Thus, trespass law provides no support for the\nCourt’s holding today.\n  The Court’s decision is also inconsistent with the\nreasonable-expectations-of-privacy test that the Court\nadopted in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). A\nreasonable person understands that odors emanating from a\nhouse may be detected from locations that are open to the\npublic, and a reasonable person will not count on the\nstrength of those odors remaining within the range that,\nwhile detectible by a dog, cannot be smelled by a human.\n  For these reasons, I would hold that no search within\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment took place in this\ncase, and I would reverse the decision below.\n                             I\n   The opinion of the Court may leave a reader with the\nmistaken impression that Detective Bartelt and Franky\nremained on respondent’s property for a prolonged period\nof time and conducted a far-flung exploration of the front\nyard. See ante, at 4 (“trawl for evidence with impunity”),\n7 (“marching his bloodhound into the garden”).

He held his head high and began “bracketing”\nthe area (pacing back and forth) in order to determine the\nstrongest source of the smell. App. 95–96. Detective\nBartelt knew “the minute [he] observed” this behavior that\nFranky had detected drugs. Id., at 95. Upon locating the\nodor’s strongest source, Franky sat at the base of the front\ndoor, and at this point, Detective Bartelt and Franky im-\nmediately returned to their patrol car. Id., at 98.\n  A critical fact that the Court omits is that, as respond-\nent’s counsel explained at oral argument, this entire\nprocess—walking down the driveway and front path to the\nfront door, waiting for Franky to find the strongest source\nof the odor, and walking back to the car—took approxi-\nmately a minute or two. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. Thus, the\namount of time that Franky and the detective remained\nat the front porch was even less. The Court also fails to\nmention that, while Detective Bartelt apparently did not\npersonally smell the odor of marijuana coming from the\nhouse, another officer who subsequently stood on the front\nporch, Detective Pedraja, did notice that smell and was\nable to identify it. App. 81.\n                             II\n  The Court concludes that the conduct in this case was a\nsearch because Detective Bartelt exceeded the boundaries\nof the license to approach the house that is recognized by\n\n——————\n  4 See App. 94; App. to Brief for Respondent 1A (depiction of respond-\n\nent’s home).\n  5 The Court notes that Franky was on a 6-foot leash, but such a\n\nleash is standard equipment for ordinary dog owners.

But it also reaches categories of visitors who\nare less universally welcome—“solicitors,” “hawkers,”\n“peddlers,” and the like. The law might attempt to draw\nfine lines between categories of welcome and unwelcome\nvisitors, distinguishing, for example, between tolerable\nand intolerable door-to-door peddlers (Girl Scouts selling\ncookies versus adults selling aluminum siding) or be-\ntween police officers on agreeable and disagreeable mis-\nsions (gathering information about a bothersome neighbor\nversus asking potentially incriminating questions).

S. 207, 213 (1986) (“The Fourth Amend-\nment protection of the home has never been extended to\nrequire law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when\npassing by a home on public thoroughfares”); Cada, supra,\nat 232, 923 P. 2d, at 477 (“[P]olice officers restricting their\nactivity to [areas to which the public is impliedly invited]\nare permitted the same intrusion and the same level\nof observation as would be expected from a reasonably\nrespectful citizen” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 1\nLaFave §§2.2(a), 2.3(c), at 450–452, 572–577.\n                             B\n  Detective Bartelt did not exceed the scope of the license\nto approach respondent’s front door. He adhered to the\ncustomary path; he did not approach in the middle of the\nnight; and he remained at the front door for only a very\nshort period (less than a minute or two).\n  The Court concludes that Detective Bartelt went too far\nbecause he had the “objectiv[e] . . . purpose to conduct a\nsearch.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis added). What this means, I\ntake it, is that anyone aware of what Detective Bartelt did\nwould infer that his subjective purpose was to gather\nevidence. But if this is the Court’s point, then a standard\n“knock and talk” and most other police visits would like-\nwise constitute searches. With the exception of visits to\n8                   FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nserve warrants or civil process, police almost always ap-\nproach homes with a purpose of discovering information.\nThat is certainly the objective of a “knock and talk.” The\nCourt offers no meaningful way of distinguishing the\n“objective purpose” of a “knock and talk” from the “objec-\ntive purpose” of Detective Bartelt’s conduct here.\n   The Court contends that a “knock and talk” is different\nbecause it involves talking, and “all are invited” to do that.\nAnte, at 7–8, n. 4 (emphasis deleted). But a police officer\nwho approaches the front door of a house in accordance\nwith the limitations already discussed may gather evi-\ndence by means other than talking. The officer may ob-\nserve items in plain view and smell odors coming from the\nhouse. Ciraolo, supra, at 213; Cada, 129 Idaho, at 232,\n923 P. 2d, at 477; 1 LaFave §§2.2(a), 2.3(c), at 450–452,\n572–577. So the Court’s “objective purpose” argument\ncannot stand.\n   What the Court must fall back on, then, is the particular\ninstrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor\nof marijuana, namely, his dog. But in the entire body of\ncommon-law decisions, the Court has not found a single\ncase holding that a visitor to the front door of a home\ncommits a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by a dog\non a leash. On the contrary, the common law allowed even\nunleashed dogs to wander on private property without\ncommitting a trespass. G. Williams, Liability for Animals\n136–146 (1939); J. Ingham, A Treatise on Property in\nAnimals Wild and Domestic and the Rights and Respon-\nsibilities Arising Therefrom 277–278 (1900).           Cf. B.\nMarkesinis & S. Deakin, Tort Law 511 (4th ed. 1999).\n   The Court responds that “[i]t is not the dog that is the\nproblem, but the behavior that here involved use of the\ndog.” Ante, at 7, n. 3. But where is the support in the law\nof trespass for this proposition? Dogs’ keen sense of smell\nhas been used in law enforcement for centuries. The\nantiquity of this practice is evidenced by a Scottish law\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfrom 1318 that made it a crime to “disturb a tracking dog\nor the men coming with it for pursuing thieves or seizing\nmalefactors.” K. Brown et al., The Records of the Parlia-\nments of Scotland to 1707, (St Andrews, 2007–2013),\nonline at http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9. If bringing a\ntracking dog to the front door of a home constituted a\ntrespass, one would expect at least one case to have arisen\nduring the past 800 years. But the Court has found none.\n  For these reasons, the real law of trespass provides no\nsupport for the Court’s holding today. While the Court\nclaims that its reasoning has “ancient and durable\nroots,” ante, at 4, its trespass rule is really a newly struck\ncounterfeit.\n                              III\n   The concurring opinion attempts to provide an alterna-\ntive ground for today’s decision, namely, that Detective\nBartelt’s conduct violated respondent’s reasonable expec-\ntations of privacy. But we have already rejected a very\nsimilar, if not identical argument, see Illinois v. Caballes,\n543 U. S. 405, 409–410 (2005), and in any event I see no\nbasis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have\na reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate\nfrom the dwelling and reach spots where members of the\npublic may lawfully stand.\n   It is clear that the occupant of a house has no reasona-\nble expectation of privacy with respect to odors that can be\nsmelled by human beings who are standing in such places.\nSee United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478, 482 (1985)\n(“After the officers came closer and detected the distinct\nodor of marihuana, they had probable cause to believe\nthat the vehicles contained contraband”); United States\nv. Ventresca, 380 U. S. 102, 111 (1965) (scent of ferment-\ning mash supported probable cause for warrant); United\nStates v. Johnston, 497 F. 2d 397, 398 (CA9 1974) (there\nis no “reasonable expectation of privacy from drug agents\n10                    FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwith inquisitive nostrils”). And I would not draw a line\nbetween odors that can be smelled by humans and those\nthat are detectible only by dogs.\n   Consider the situation from the point of view of the\noccupant of a building in which marijuana is grown or\nmethamphetamine is manufactured. Would such an oc-\ncupant reason as follows? “I know that odors may ema-\nnate from my building and that atmospheric conditions,\nsuch as the force and direction of the wind, may affect the\nstrength of those odors when they reach a spot where\nmembers of the public may lawfully stand. I also know\nthat some people have a much more acute sense of smell\nthan others,6 and I have no idea who might be standing in\none of the spots in question when the odors from my house\nreach that location. In addition, I know that odors coming\nfrom my building, when they reach these locations, may be\nstrong enough to be detected by a dog. But I am confident\nthat they will be so faint that they cannot be smelled by\nany human being.” Such a finely tuned expectation would\nbe entirely unrealistic, and I see no evidence that society\nis prepared to recognize it as reasonable.\n   In an attempt to show that respondent had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the odor of marijuana wafting\nfrom his house, the concurrence argues that this case is\njust like Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), which\nheld that police officers conducted a search when they\nused a thermal imaging device to detect heat emanating\nfrom a house. Ante, at 3–4 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). This\nCourt, however, has already rejected the argument that\n——————\n  6 Some humans naturally have a much more acute sense of smell\n\nthan others, and humans can be trained to detect and distinguish odors\nthat could not be detected without such training. See E. Hancock, A\nPrimer on Smell, http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/996web/smell.html. Some\nindividuals employed in the perfume and wine industries, for example,\nhave an amazingly acute sense of smell. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe use of a drug-sniffing dog is the same as the use of a\nthermal imaging device. See Caballes, 543 U. S., at 409–\n410. The very argument now advanced by the concurrence\nappears in Justice Souter’s Caballes dissent. See id., at\n413, and n. 3. But the Court was not persuaded.\n   Contrary to the interpretation propounded by the con-\ncurrence, Kyllo is best understood as a decision about the\nuse of new technology. The Kyllo Court focused on the fact\nthat the thermal imaging device was a form of “sense-\nenhancing technology” that was “not in general public\nuse,” and it expressed concern that citizens would be “at\nthe mercy of advancing technology” if its use was not\nrestricted. 533 U. S., at 34–35. A dog, however, is not a\nnew form of “technology or a “device.” And, as noted, the\nuse of dogs’ acute sense of smell in law enforcement dates\nback many centuries.\n   The concurrence suggests that a Kyllo-based decision\nwould be “much like” the actual decision of the Court, but\nthat is simply not so. The holding of the Court is based on\nwhat the Court sees as a “ ‘physical intrusion of a constitu-\ntionally protected area.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting United States\nv. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J., concur-\nring in judgment)). As a result, it does not apply when a\ndog alerts while on a public sidewalk or street or in the\ncorridor of a building to which the dog and handler have\nbeen lawfully admitted.\n   The concurrence’s Kyllo-based approach would have a\nmuch wider reach. When the police used the thermal\nimaging device in Kyllo, they were on a public street, 533\nU. S., at 29, and “committed no trespass.” Ante, at 3.\nTherefore, if a dog’s nose is just like a thermal imaging\ndevice for Fourth Amendment purposes, a search would\noccur if a dog alerted while on a public sidewalk or in the\ncorridor of an apartment building. And the same would be\ntrue if the dog was trained to sniff, not for marijuana, but\nfor more dangerous quarry, such as explosives or for a\n12                 FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nviolent fugitive or kidnaped child. I see no ground for\nhampering legitimate law enforcement in this way.\n                            IV\n  The conduct of the police officer in this case did not\nconstitute a trespass and did not violate respondent’s\nreasonable expectations of privacy. I would hold that this\nconduct was not a search, and I therefore respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>", "id": 856195, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/03/26/florida_v._jardines.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued October 31, 2012—Decided March 26, 2013\nPolice took a drug-sniffing dog to Jardines’ front porch, where the dog\n  gave a positive alert for narcotics. Based on the alert, the officers ob-\n  tained a warrant for a search, which revealed marijuana plants;\n  Jardines was charged with trafficking in cannabis. The Supreme\n  Court of Florida approved the trial court’s decision to suppress the\n  evidence, holding that the officers had engaged in a Fourth Amend-\n  ment search unsupported by probable cause.\nHeld: The investigation of Jardines’ home was a “search” within the\n meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Pp. 3–10.\n    (a) When “the Government obtains information by physically in-\n truding” on persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a ‘search’ within the\n original meaning of the Fourth Amendment” has “undoubtedly oc-\n curred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3. Pp. 3–4.\n    (b) At the Fourth Amendment’s “very core” stands “the right of a\n man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreason-\n able governmental intrusion.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S.\n 505, 511. The area “immediately surrounding and associated with\n the home”—the curtilage—is “part of the home itself for Fourth\n Amendment purposes.” Oliver v. United States, 466 U. S. 170, 180.\n The officers entered the curtilage here: The front porch is the classic\n exemplar of an area “to which the activity of home life extends.” Id.,\n at 182, n. 12. Pp. 4–5.\n    (c) The officers’ entry was not explicitly or implicitly invited. Offi-\n cers need not “shield their eyes” when passing by a home “on public\n thoroughfares,” California v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213, but “no man\n can set his foot upon his neighbour’s close without his leave,” Entick\n v. Carrington, 2 Wils. K. B. 275, 291, 95 Eng. Rep. 807, 817. A police\n officer not armed with a warrant may approach a home in hopes of\n speaking to its occupants, because that is “no more than any private\n2                          FLORIDA v.

One month later, the Department and the\nDrug Enforcement Administration sent a joint surveillance\nteam to Jardines’ home. Detective Pedraja was part of\nthat team. He watched the home for fifteen minutes and\nsaw no vehicles in the driveway or activity around the\nhome, and could not see inside because the blinds were\ndrawn. Detective Pedraja then approached Jardines’\nhome accompanied by Detective Douglas Bartelt, a trained\ncanine handler who had just arrived at the scene with his\ndrug-sniffing dog. The dog was trained to detect the scent\nof marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and several other drugs,\nindicating the presence of any of these substances through\nparticular behavioral changes recognizable by his handler.\n2                  FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash, owing\nin part to the dog’s “wild” nature, App. to Pet. for Cert. A–\n35, and tendency to dart around erratically while search-\ning. As the dog approached Jardines’ front porch, he\napparently sensed one of the odors he had been trained to\ndetect, and began energetically exploring the area for the\nstrongest point source of that odor. As Detective Bartelt\nexplained, the dog “began tracking that airborne odor by\n. . . tracking back and forth,” engaging in what is called\n“bracketing,” “back and forth, back and forth.” Id., at A–\n33 to A–34. Detective Bartelt gave the dog “the full six\nfeet of the leash plus whatever safe distance [he could]\ngive him” to do this—he testified that he needed to give\nthe dog “as much distance as I can.” Id., at A–35. And\nDetective Pedraja stood back while this was occurring, so\nthat he would not “get knocked over” when the dog was\n“spinning around trying to find” the source. Id., at A–38.\n    After sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat,\nwhich is the trained behavior upon discovering the odor’s\nstrongest point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog\naway from the door and returned to his vehicle. He left\nthe scene after informing Detective Pedraja that there had\nbeen a positive alert for narcotics.\n    On the basis of what he had learned at the home, De-\ntective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to\nsearch the residence. When the warrant was executed later\nthat day, Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the\nsearch revealed marijuana plants, and he was charged\nwith trafficking in cannabis.\n    At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana\nplants on the ground that the canine investigation was an\nunreasonable search. The trial court granted the motion,\nand the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed.\nOn a petition for discretionary review, the Florida Su-\npreme Court quashed the decision of the Third District\nCourt of Appeal and approved the trial court’s decision to\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

S. ___ (2012).\n                               II\n   The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that\nthe “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,\npapers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\nseizures, shall not be violated.” The Amendment estab-\nlishes a simple baseline, one that for much of our history\nformed the exclusive basis for its protections: When “the\nGovernment obtains information by physically intruding”\non persons, houses, papers, or effects, “a ‘search’ within\nthe original meaning of the Fourth Amendment” has “un-\ndoubtedly occurred.” United States v. Jones, 565 U. S.\n___, ___, n. 3 (2012) (slip op., at 6, n. 3). By reason of\nour decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347\n(1967), property rights “are not the sole measure of Fourth\nAmendment violations,” Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U. S.\n56, 64 (1992)—but though Katz may add to the baseline, it\ndoes not subtract anything from the Amendment’s protec-\ntions “when the Government does engage in [a] physi-\ncal intrusion of a constitutionally protected area,” United\nStates v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment).\n   That principle renders this case a straightforward one.\nThe officers were gathering information in an area belong-\ning to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house—\nin the curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys\nprotection as part of the home itself. And they gathered\nthat information by physically entering and occupying the\n4                  FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narea to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly per-\nmitted by the homeowner.\n                             A\n   The Fourth Amendment “indicates with some precision\nthe places and things encompassed by its protections”:\npersons, houses, papers, and effects. Oliver v. United\nStates, 466 U. S. 170, 176 (1984). The Fourth Amendment\ndoes not, therefore, prevent all investigations conducted\non private property; for example, an officer may (subject to\nKatz) gather information in what we have called “open\nfields”—even if those fields are privately owned—because\nsuch fields are not enumerated in the Amendment’s text.\nHester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57 (1924).\n   But when it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home\nis first among equals. At the Amendment’s “very core”\nstands “the right of a man to retreat into his own home\nand there be free from unreasonable governmental in-\ntrusion.” Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\n(1961). This right would be of little practical value if the\nState’s agents could stand in a home’s porch or side gar-\nden and trawl for evidence with impunity; the right to\nretreat would be significantly diminished if the police\ncould enter a man’s property to observe his repose from\njust outside the front window.\n   We therefore regard the area “immediately surrounding\nand associated with the home”—what our cases call the\ncurtilage—as “part of the home itself for Fourth Amend-\nment purposes.” Oliver, supra, at 180. That principle has\nancient and durable roots. Just as the distinction between\nthe home and the open fields is “as old as the common\nlaw,” Hester, supra, at 59, so too is the identity of home\nand what Blackstone called the “curtilage or homestall,”\nfor the “house protects and privileges all its branches and\nappurtenants.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 223, 225 (1769). This area around the\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207,\n213 (1986).\n   While the boundaries of the curtilage are generally\n“clearly marked,” the “conception defining the curtilage” is\nat any rate familiar enough that it is “easily understood\nfrom our daily experience.” Oliver, 466 U. S., at 182, n. 12.\nHere there is no doubt that the officers entered it: The\nfront porch is the classic exemplar of an area adjacent to\nthe home and “to which the activity of home life extends.”\nIbid.\n                               B\n   Since the officers’ investigation took place in a constitu-\ntionally protected area, we turn to the question of whether\nit was accomplished through an unlicensed physical in-\ntrusion.1 While law enforcement officers need not “shield\ntheir eyes” when passing by the home “on public thorough-\nfares,” Ciraolo, 476 U. S., at 213, an officer’s leave to\ngather information is sharply circumscribed when he steps\noff those thoroughfares and enters the Fourth Amend-\nment’s protected areas. In permitting, for example, visual\nobservation of the home from “public navigable airspace,”\nwe were careful to note that it was done “in a physically\nnonintrusive manner.” Ibid. Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils.\nK. B. 275, 95 Eng. Rep. 807 (K. B. 1765), a case “undoubt-\nedly familiar” to “every American statesman” at the time\nof the Founding, Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626\n——————\n   1 At oral argument, the State and its amicus the Solicitor General\n\nargued that Jardines conceded in the lower courts that the officers had\na right to be where they were. This misstates the record. Jardines\nconceded nothing more than the unsurprising proposition that the of-\nficers could have lawfully approached his home to knock on the front\ndoor in hopes of speaking with him. Of course, that is not what they\ndid.\n6                       FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1886), states the general rule clearly: “[O]ur law holds the\nproperty of every man so sacred, that no man can set his\nfoot upon his neighbour’s close without his leave.” 2 Wils.\nK.

As it is undisputed\nthat the detectives had all four of their feet and all four of\ntheir companion’s firmly planted on the constitutionally\nprotected extension of Jardines’ home, the only question is\nwhether he had given his leave (even implicitly) for them\nto do so. He had not.\n   “A license may be implied from the habits of the coun-\ntry,” notwithstanding the “strict rule of the English com-\nmon law as to entry upon a close.” McKee v. Gratz, 260\nU. S. 127, 136 (1922) (Holmes, J.). We have accordingly\nrecognized that “the knocker on the front door is treated\nas an invitation or license to attempt an entry, justifying\ningress to the home by solicitors, hawkers and peddlers\nof all kinds.” Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622, 626\n(1951). This implicit license typically permits the visitor\nto approach the home by the front path, knock promptly,\nwait briefly to be received, and then (absent invitation to\nlinger longer) leave. Complying with the terms of that\ntraditional invitation does not require fine-grained legal\nknowledge; it is generally managed without incident by\nthe Nation’s Girl Scouts and trick-or-treaters.2 Thus, a\npolice officer not armed with a warrant may approach a\nhome and knock, precisely because that is “no more than\nany private citizen might do.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S.\n——————\n    2 With this much, the dissent seems to agree—it would inquire into\n\n“ ‘the appearance of things,’ ” post, at 5 (opinion of ALITO, J.), what is\n“typica[l]” for a visitor, ibid., what might cause “alarm” to a “resident of\nthe premises,” ibid., what is “expected” of “ordinary visitors,” ibid., and\nwhat would be expected from a “ ‘reasonably respectful citizen,’ ” post, at\n7. These are good questions. But their answers are incompatible with\nthe dissent’s outcome, which is presumably why the dissent does not\neven try to argue that it would be customary, usual, reasonable, re-\nspectful, ordinary, typical, nonalarming, etc., for a stranger to explore\nthe curtilage of the home with trained drug dogs.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16).\n   But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area\naround the home in hopes of discovering incriminating\nevidence is something else. There is no customary invita-\ntion to do that. An invitation to engage in canine forensic\ninvestigation assuredly does not inhere in the very act of\nhanging a knocker.3 To find a visitor knocking on the door\nis routine (even if sometimes unwelcome); to spot that\nsame visitor exploring the front path with a metal detec-\ntor, or marching his bloodhound into the garden before\nsaying hello and asking permission, would inspire most\nof us to—well, call the police. The scope of a license—\nexpress or implied—is limited not only to a particular area\nbut also to a specific purpose. Consent at a traffic stop to\nan officer’s checking out an anonymous tip that there is a\nbody in the trunk does not permit the officer to rummage\nthrough the trunk for narcotics. Here, the background\nsocial norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not\ninvite him there to conduct a search.4\n——————\n   3 The dissent insists that our argument must rest upon “the particu-\n\nlar instrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor of mari-\njuana”—the dog. Post, at 8. It is not the dog that is the problem, but the\nbehavior that here involved use of the dog. We think a typical person\nwould find it “ ‘a cause for great alarm’ ” (the kind of reaction the dis-\nsent quite rightly relies upon to justify its no-night-visits rule, post,\nat 5) to find a stranger snooping about his front porch with or without\na dog. The dissent would let the police do whatever they want by way\nof gathering evidence so long as they stay on the base-path, to use a\nbaseball analogy—so long as they “stick to the path that is typically\nused to approach a front door, such as a paved walkway.” Ibid. From\nthat vantage point they can presumably peer into the house through\nbinoculars with impunity. That is not the law, as even the State con-\ncedes. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.\n   4 The dissent argues, citing King, that “gathering evidence—even\n\ndamning evidence—is a lawful activity that falls within the scope of the\nlicense to approach.” Post, at 7. That is a false generalization. What\nKing establishes is that it is not a Fourth Amendment search to ap-\nproach the home in order to speak with the occupant, because all are\n8                      FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  The State points to our decisions holding that the sub-\njective intent of the officer is irrelevant. See Ashcroft v.\nal-Kidd, 563 U. S. ___ (2011); Whren v. United States, 517\nU. S. 806 (1996). But those cases merely hold that a stop\nor search that is objectively reasonable is not vitiated by\nthe fact that the officer’s real reason for making the stop\nor search has nothing to do with the validating reason.\nThus, the defendant will not be heard to complain that\nalthough he was speeding the officer’s real reason for the\nstop was racial harassment. See id., at 810, 813. Here,\nhowever, the question before the court is precisely whether\nthe officer’s conduct was an objectively reasonable search.\nAs we have described, that depends upon whether the\nofficers had an implied license to enter the porch, which in\nturn depends upon the purpose for which they entered.\nHere, their behavior objectively reveals a purpose to con-\nduct a search, which is not what anyone would think he\nhad license to do.\n                              III\n   The State argues that investigation by a forensic narcot-\nics dog by definition cannot implicate any legitimate pri-\nvacy interest. The State cites for authority our decisions\nin United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), United\nStates v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109 (1984), and Illinois v.\nCaballes, 543 U. S. 405 (2005), which held, respectively,\nthat canine inspection of luggage in an airport, chemical\ntesting of a substance that had fallen from a parcel in\ntransit, and canine inspection of an automobile during a\nlawful traffic stop, do not violate the “reasonable expecta-\ntion of privacy” described in Katz.\n\n—————— \n\ninvited to do that. The mere “purpose of discovering information,” post,\nat 8, in the course of engaging in that permitted conduct does not cause\nit to violate the Fourth Amendment. But no one is impliedly invited to\nenter the protected premises of the home in order to do nothing but\nconduct a search.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Just last Term, we considered an argument much like\nthis. Jones held that tracking an automobile’s where-\nabouts using a physically-mounted GPS receiver is a Fourth\nAmendment search. The Government argued that the\nKatz standard “show[ed] that no search occurred,” as the\ndefendant had “no ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ ” in\nhis whereabouts on the public roads, Jones, 565 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5)—a proposition with at least as much\nsupport in our case law as the one the State marshals\nhere. See, e.g., United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 278\n(1983). But because the GPS receiver had been physically\nmounted on the defendant’s automobile (thus intruding on\nhis “effects”), we held that tracking the vehicle’s move-\nments was a search: a person’s “Fourth Amendment rights\ndo not rise or fall with the Katz formulation.” Jones,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). The Katz reasonable-\nexpectations test “has been added to, not substituted\nfor,” the traditional property-based understanding of the\nFourth Amendment, and so is unnecessary to consider\nwhen the government gains evidence by physically intrud-\ning on constitutionally protected areas. Jones, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 8).\n   Thus, we need not decide whether the officers’ investiga-\ntion of Jardines’ home violated his expectation of privacy\nunder Katz. One virtue of the Fourth Amendment’s\nproperty-rights baseline is that it keeps easy cases easy.\nThat the officers learned what they learned only by physi-\ncally intruding on Jardines’ property to gather evidence is\nenough to establish that a search occurred.\n   For a related reason we find irrelevant the State’s ar-\ngument (echoed by the dissent) that forensic dogs have\nbeen commonly used by police for centuries. This argu-\nment is apparently directed to our holding in Kyllo v.\nUnited States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), that surveillance of\nthe home is a search where “the Government uses a device\nthat is not in general public use” to “explore details of the\n10                 FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhome that would previously have been unknowable with-\nout physical intrusion.” Id., at 40 (emphasis added). But\nthe implication of that statement (inclusio unius est exclu-\nsio alterius) is that when the government uses a physical\nintrusion to explore details of the home (including its\ncurtilage), the antiquity of the tools that they bring along\nis irrelevant.\n                      *    *    *\n   The government’s use of trained police dogs to inves-\ntigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a\n“search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore\naffirmed.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

A stranger\ncomes to the front door of your home carrying super-high-\npowered binoculars. See ante, at 7, n. 3. He doesn’t knock\nor say hello. Instead, he stands on the porch and uses the\nbinoculars to peer through your windows, into your home’s\nfurthest corners. It doesn’t take long (the binoculars are\nreally very fine): In just a couple of minutes, his uncom-\nmon behavior allows him to learn details of your life you\ndisclose to no one. Has your “visitor” trespassed on your\nproperty, exceeding the license you have granted to mem-\nbers of the public to, say, drop off the mail or distribute\ncampaign flyers? Yes, he has. And has he also invaded\nyour “reasonable expectation of privacy,” by nosing into\nintimacies you sensibly thought protected from disclosure?\nKatz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 360 (1967) (Harlan,\nJ., concurring). Yes, of course, he has done that too.\n   That case is this case in every way that matters. Here,\npolice officers came to Joelis Jardines’ door with a super-\nsensitive instrument, which they deployed to detect things\ninside that they could not perceive unassisted. The equip-\nment they used was animal, not mineral. But contra the\ndissent, see post, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.) (noting the\nubiquity of dogs in American households), that is of no\n2                   FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     KAGAN, J., concurring\n\nsignificance in determining whether a search occurred.\nDetective Bartelt’s dog was not your neighbor’s pet, come\nto your porch on a leisurely stroll. As this Court discussed\nearlier this Term, drug-detection dogs are highly trained\ntools of law enforcement, geared to respond in distinctive\nways to specific scents so as to convey clear and reliable\ninformation to their human partners. See Florida v.\nHarris, 568 U. S. ___ (2013) (slip op. at 2–3, 7–8). They\nare to the poodle down the street as high-powered binocu-\nlars are to a piece of plain glass. Like the binoculars, a\ndrug-detection dog is a specialized device for discovering\nobjects not in plain view (or plain smell). And as in the\nhypothetical above, that device was aimed here at a\nhome—the most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of\nall the places and things the Fourth Amendment protects.\nWas this activity a trespass? Yes, as the Court holds to-\nday. Was it also an invasion of privacy? Yes, that as well.\n   The Court today treats this case under a property ru-\nbric; I write separately to note that I could just as happily\nhave decided it by looking to Jardines’ privacy interests. A\ndecision along those lines would have looked . . . well,\nmuch like this one. It would have talked about “ ‘the right\nof a man to retreat into his own home and there be free\nfrom unreasonable governmental intrusion.’ ” Ante, at 4\n(quoting Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511\n(1961)). It would have insisted on maintaining the “prac-\ntical value” of that right by preventing police officers from\nstanding in an adjacent space and “trawl[ing] for evidence\nwith impunity.” Ante, at 4. It would have explained that\n“ ‘privacy expectations are most heightened’ ” in the home\nand the surrounding area. Ante, at 4–5 (quoting Califor-\nnia v. Ciraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986)). And it would\nhave determined that police officers invade those shared\nexpectations when they use trained canine assistants to\nreveal within the confines of a home what they could not\notherwise have found there. See ante, at 6–7, and nn. 2–3.\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

The law of property “naturally enough influence[s]”\nour “shared social expectations” of what places should be\nfree from governmental incursions. Georgia v. Randolph,\n547 U. S. 103, 111 (2006); see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S.\n128, 143, n. 12 (1978). And so the sentiment “my home is\nmy own,” while originating in property law, now also\ndenotes a common understanding—extending even beyond\nthat law’s formal protections—about an especially private\nsphere. Jardines’ home was his property; it was also his\nmost intimate and familiar space. The analysis proceed-\ning from each of those facts, as today’s decision reveals,\nruns mostly along the same path.\n  I can think of only one divergence: If we had decided\nthis case on privacy grounds, we would have realized that\nKyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), already re-\nsolved it.1 The Kyllo Court held that police officers con-\nducted a search when they used a thermal-imaging device\nto detect heat emanating from a private home, even\nthough they committed no trespass. Highlighting our\nintention to draw both a “firm” and a “bright” line at “the\nentrance to the house,” id., at 40, we announced the fol-\nlowing rule:\n     “Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is\n     not in general public use, to explore details of the\n     home that would previously have been unknowable\n——————\n   1 The dissent claims, alternatively, that Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U. S.\n\n405, 409–410 (2005), controls this case (or nearly does). See post, at 9,\n11. But Caballes concerned a drug-detection dog’s sniff of an automo-\nbile during a traffic stop. See also Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. ___\n(2013). And we have held, over and over again, that people’s expecta-\ntions of privacy are much lower in their cars than in their homes. See,\ne.g., Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 345 (2009); Wyoming v. Houghton,\n526 U. S. 295, 303 (1999); New York v. Class, 475 U. S. 106, 115 (1986);\nCardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583, 590–591 (1974) (plurality opinion).\n4                      FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         KAGAN, J., concurring\n\n       without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a\n       ‘search’ and is presumptively unreasonable without a\n       warrant.” Ibid.\nThat “firm” and “bright” rule governs this case: The police\nofficers here conducted a search because they used a\n“device . . . not in general public use” (a trained drug-\ndetection dog) to “explore details of the home” (the pres-\nence of certain substances) that they would not otherwise\nhave discovered without entering the premises.\n   And again, the dissent’s argument that the device is just\na dog cannot change the equation. As Kyllo made clear,\nthe “sense-enhancing” tool at issue may be “crude” or\n“sophisticated,” may be old or new (drug-detection dogs\nactually go back not “12,000 years” or “centuries,” post, at\n2, 8, 12, but only a few decades), may be either smaller or\nbigger than a breadbox; still, “at least where (as here)” the\ndevice is not “in general public use,” training it on a home\nviolates our “minimal expectation of privacy”—an expecta-\ntion “that exists, and that is acknowledged to be reasona-\nble.” 533 U. S., at 34, 36.2 That does not mean the device\n——————\n    2 The\n        dissent’s other principal reason for concluding that no violation\nof privacy occurred in this case—that police officers themselves might\ndetect an aroma wafting from a house—works no better. If officers can\nsmell drugs coming from a house, they can use that information; a\nhuman sniff is not a search, we can all agree. But it does not follow\nthat a person loses his expectation of privacy in the many scents within\nhis home that (his own nose capably tells him) are not usually detecti-\nble by humans standing outside. And indeed, Kyllo already decided as\nmuch. In response to an identical argument from the dissent in that\ncase, see 533 U. S., at 43 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that humans\ncan sometimes detect “heat emanating from a building”), the Kyllo\nCourt stated: “The dissent’s comparison of the thermal imaging to\nvarious circumstances in which outside observers might be able to\nperceive, without technology, the heat of the home . . . is quite irrele-\nvant. The fact that equivalent information could sometimes be ob-\ntained by other means does not make lawful the use of means that\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. . . . In any event, [at the time in\nquestion,] no outside observer could have discerned the relative heat of\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (describing\nexigencies allowing the warrantless search of a home).\n   With these further thoughts, suggesting that a focus on\nJardines’ privacy interests would make an “easy cas[e]\neasy” twice over, ante, at 10, I join the Court’s opinion in\nfull.\n\n\n\n\n—————— \n\nKyllo’s home without thermal imaging.” Id., at 35, n. 2. \n\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

This\nlicense is not limited to persons who intend to speak to an\noccupant or who actually do so. (Mail carriers and persons\ndelivering packages and flyers are examples of individuals\nwho may lawfully approach a front door without intending\nto converse.) Nor is the license restricted to categories\nof visitors whom an occupant of the dwelling is likely to\nwelcome; as the Court acknowledges, this license applies\neven to “solicitors, hawkers and peddlers of all kinds.”\nAnte, at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the\nlicense even extends to police officers who wish to gather\nevidence against an occupant (by asking potentially in-\ncriminating questions).\n   According to the Court, however, the police officer in\nthis case, Detective Bartelt, committed a trespass because\nhe was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to\nthe front door of respondent’s house by his dog, Franky.\nWhere is the authority evidencing such a rule? Dogs have\n2                     FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                        ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbeen domesticated for about 12,000 years;1 they were\nubiquitous in both this country and Britain at the time of\nthe adoption of the Fourth Amendment;2 and their acute\nsense of smell has been used in law enforcement for centu-\nries.3 Yet the Court has been unable to find a single\ncase—from the United States or any other common-law\nnation—that supports the rule on which its decision is\nbased. Thus, trespass law provides no support for the\nCourt’s holding today.\n  The Court’s decision is also inconsistent with the\nreasonable-expectations-of-privacy test that the Court\nadopted in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). A\nreasonable person understands that odors emanating from a\nhouse may be detected from locations that are open to the\npublic, and a reasonable person will not count on the\nstrength of those odors remaining within the range that,\nwhile detectible by a dog, cannot be smelled by a human.\n  For these reasons, I would hold that no search within\nthe meaning of the Fourth Amendment took place in this\ncase, and I would reverse the decision below.\n                             I\n   The opinion of the Court may leave a reader with the\nmistaken impression that Detective Bartelt and Franky\nremained on respondent’s property for a prolonged period\nof time and conducted a far-flung exploration of the front\nyard. See ante, at 4 (“trawl for evidence with impunity”),\n7 (“marching his bloodhound into the garden”).

He held his head high and began “bracketing”\nthe area (pacing back and forth) in order to determine the\nstrongest source of the smell. App. 95–96. Detective\nBartelt knew “the minute [he] observed” this behavior that\nFranky had detected drugs. Id., at 95. Upon locating the\nodor’s strongest source, Franky sat at the base of the front\ndoor, and at this point, Detective Bartelt and Franky im-\nmediately returned to their patrol car. Id., at 98.\n  A critical fact that the Court omits is that, as respond-\nent’s counsel explained at oral argument, this entire\nprocess—walking down the driveway and front path to the\nfront door, waiting for Franky to find the strongest source\nof the odor, and walking back to the car—took approxi-\nmately a minute or two. Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–58. Thus, the\namount of time that Franky and the detective remained\nat the front porch was even less. The Court also fails to\nmention that, while Detective Bartelt apparently did not\npersonally smell the odor of marijuana coming from the\nhouse, another officer who subsequently stood on the front\nporch, Detective Pedraja, did notice that smell and was\nable to identify it. App. 81.\n                             II\n  The Court concludes that the conduct in this case was a\nsearch because Detective Bartelt exceeded the boundaries\nof the license to approach the house that is recognized by\n\n——————\n  4 See App. 94; App. to Brief for Respondent 1A (depiction of respond-\n\nent’s home).\n  5 The Court notes that Franky was on a 6-foot leash, but such a\n\nleash is standard equipment for ordinary dog owners.

JARDINES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe law of trespass, but the Court’s interpretation of the\nscope of that license is unfounded.\n                              A\n   It is said that members of the public may lawfully pro-\nceed along a walkway leading to the front door of a house\nbecause custom grants them a license to do so. Breard v.\nAlexandria, 341 U. S. 622, 626 (1951); Lakin v. Ames, 64\nMass. 198, 220 (1852); J. Bishop, Commentaries on the\nNon-Contract Law §823, p. 378 (1889). This rule encom-\npasses categories of visitors whom most homeowners\nalmost certainly wish to allow to approach their front\ndoors—friends, relatives, mail carriers, persons making\ndeliveries. But it also reaches categories of visitors who\nare less universally welcome—“solicitors,” “hawkers,”\n“peddlers,” and the like. The law might attempt to draw\nfine lines between categories of welcome and unwelcome\nvisitors, distinguishing, for example, between tolerable\nand intolerable door-to-door peddlers (Girl Scouts selling\ncookies versus adults selling aluminum siding) or be-\ntween police officers on agreeable and disagreeable mis-\nsions (gathering information about a bothersome neighbor\nversus asking potentially incriminating questions). But\nthe law of trespass has not attempted such a difficult\ntaxonomy. See Desnick v. American Broadcasting Cos., 44\nF. 3d 1345, 1351 (CA7 1995) (“[C]onsent to an entry is\noften given legal effect even though the entrant has inten-\ntions that if known to the owner of the property would\ncause him for perfectly understandable and generally\nethical or at least lawful reasons to revoke his consent”);\ncf. Skinner v. Ogallala Public School Dist., 262 Neb. 387,\n402, 631 N. W. 2d 510, 525 (2001) (“[I]n order to determine\nif a business invitation is implied, the inquiry is not a\nsubjective assessment of why the visitor chose to visit the\npremises in a particular instance”); Crown Cork & Seal\nCo. v. Kane, 213 Md. 152, 159, 131 A. 2d 470, 473–474\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n(1957) (noting that “there are many cases in which an\ninvitation has been implied from circumstances, such as\ncustom,” and that this test is “objective in that it stresses\ncustom and the appearance of things” as opposed to “the\nundisclosed intention of the visitor”).\n   Of course, this license has certain spatial and temporal\nlimits. A visitor must stick to the path that is typically\nused to approach a front door, such as a paved walkway.\nA visitor cannot traipse through the garden, meander into\nthe backyard, or take other circuitous detours that veer\nfrom the pathway that a visitor would customarily use.\nSee, e.g., Robinson v. Virginia, 47 Va. App. 533, 549–550,\n625 S. E. 2d 651, 659 (2006) (en banc); United States v.\nWells, 648 F. 3d 671, 679–680 (CA8 2011) (police exceeded\nscope of their implied invitation when they bypassed the\nfront door and proceeded directly to the back yard); State\nv. Harris, 919 S. W. 2d 619, 624 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995)\n(“Any substantial and unreasonable departure from an\narea where the public is impliedly invited exceeds the\nscope of the implied invitation . . . ” (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted)); 1 W. LaFave, Search and\nSeizure §2.3(c), p. 578 (2004) (hereinafter LaFave); id.,\n§2.3(f), at 600–603 (“[W]hen the police come on to private\nproperty to conduct an investigation or for some other\nlegitimate purpose and restrict their movements to places\nvisitors could be expected to go (e.g., walkways, drive-\nways, porches), observations made from such vantage points\nare not covered by the Fourth Amendment” (footnotes\nomitted)).\n   Nor, as a general matter, may a visitor come to the front\ndoor in the middle of the night without an express invita-\ntion. See State v. Cada, 129 Idaho 224, 233, 923 P. 2d 469,\n478 (App. 1996) (“Furtive intrusion late at night or in the\npredawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordi-\nnary visitors. Indeed, if observed by a resident of the\npremises, it could be a cause for great alarm”).\n6                  FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   Similarly, a visitor may not linger at the front door for\nan extended period. See 9 So. 3d 1, 11 (Fla. App. 2008)\n(case below) (Cope, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (“[T]here is no such thing as squatter’s rights on a\nfront porch. A stranger may not plop down uninvited to\nspend the afternoon in the front porch rocking chair, or\nthrow down a sleeping bag to spend the night, or lurk on\nthe front porch, looking in the windows”). The license is\nlimited to the amount of time it would customarily take to\napproach the door, pause long enough to see if someone is\nhome, and (if not expressly invited to stay longer), leave.\n   As I understand the law of trespass and the scope of the\nimplied license, a visitor who adheres to these limitations\nis not necessarily required to ring the doorbell, knock on\nthe door, or attempt to speak with an occupant. For ex-\nample, mail carriers, persons making deliveries, and in-\ndividuals distributing flyers may leave the items they\nare carrying and depart without making any attempt to\nconverse. A pedestrian or motorist looking for a particular\naddress may walk up to a front door in order to check a\nhouse number that is hard to see from the sidewalk or\nroad. A neighbor who knows that the residents are away\nmay approach the door to retrieve an accumulation of\nnewspapers that might signal to a potential burglar that\nthe house is unoccupied.\n   As the majority acknowledges, this implied license to\napproach the front door extends to the police. See ante, at\n6. As we recognized in Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___\n(2011), police officers do not engage in a search when they\napproach the front door of a residence and seek to engage\nin what is termed a “knock and talk,” i.e., knocking on the\ndoor and seeking to speak to an occupant for the purpose\nof gathering evidence. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 16)\n(“When law enforcement officers who are not armed with a\nwarrant knock on a door, they do no more than any pri-\nvate citizen might do”). See also 1 LaFave §2.3(e), at 592\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n(“It is not objectionable for an officer to come upon that\npart of the property which has been opened to public\ncommon use” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Even\nwhen the objective of a “knock and talk” is to obtain evi-\ndence that will lead to the homeowner’s arrest and prose-\ncution, the license to approach still applies. In other\nwords, gathering evidence—even damning evidence—is a\nlawful activity that falls within the scope of the license to\napproach. And when officers walk up to the front door of a\nhouse, they are permitted to see, hear, and smell whatever\ncan be detected from a lawful vantage point. California v.\nCiraolo, 476 U. S. 207, 213 (1986) (“The Fourth Amend-\nment protection of the home has never been extended to\nrequire law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when\npassing by a home on public thoroughfares”); Cada, supra,\nat 232, 923 P. 2d, at 477 (“[P]olice officers restricting their\nactivity to [areas to which the public is impliedly invited]\nare permitted the same intrusion and the same level\nof observation as would be expected from a reasonably\nrespectful citizen” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 1\nLaFave §§2.2(a), 2.3(c), at 450–452, 572–577.\n                             B\n  Detective Bartelt did not exceed the scope of the license\nto approach respondent’s front door. He adhered to the\ncustomary path; he did not approach in the middle of the\nnight; and he remained at the front door for only a very\nshort period (less than a minute or two).\n  The Court concludes that Detective Bartelt went too far\nbecause he had the “objectiv[e] . . . purpose to conduct a\nsearch.” Ante, at 8 (emphasis added). What this means, I\ntake it, is that anyone aware of what Detective Bartelt did\nwould infer that his subjective purpose was to gather\nevidence. But if this is the Court’s point, then a standard\n“knock and talk” and most other police visits would like-\nwise constitute searches. With the exception of visits to\n8                   FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nserve warrants or civil process, police almost always ap-\nproach homes with a purpose of discovering information.\nThat is certainly the objective of a “knock and talk.” The\nCourt offers no meaningful way of distinguishing the\n“objective purpose” of a “knock and talk” from the “objec-\ntive purpose” of Detective Bartelt’s conduct here.\n   The Court contends that a “knock and talk” is different\nbecause it involves talking, and “all are invited” to do that.\nAnte, at 7–8, n. 4 (emphasis deleted). But a police officer\nwho approaches the front door of a house in accordance\nwith the limitations already discussed may gather evi-\ndence by means other than talking. The officer may ob-\nserve items in plain view and smell odors coming from the\nhouse. Ciraolo, supra, at 213; Cada, 129 Idaho, at 232,\n923 P. 2d, at 477; 1 LaFave §§2.2(a), 2.3(c), at 450–452,\n572–577. So the Court’s “objective purpose” argument\ncannot stand.\n   What the Court must fall back on, then, is the particular\ninstrument that Detective Bartelt used to detect the odor\nof marijuana, namely, his dog. But in the entire body of\ncommon-law decisions, the Court has not found a single\ncase holding that a visitor to the front door of a home\ncommits a trespass if the visitor is accompanied by a dog\non a leash. On the contrary, the common law allowed even\nunleashed dogs to wander on private property without\ncommitting a trespass. G. Williams, Liability for Animals\n136–146 (1939); J. Ingham, A Treatise on Property in\nAnimals Wild and Domestic and the Rights and Respon-\nsibilities Arising Therefrom 277–278 (1900).           Cf. B.\nMarkesinis & S. Deakin, Tort Law 511 (4th ed. 1999).\n   The Court responds that “[i]t is not the dog that is the\nproblem, but the behavior that here involved use of the\ndog.” Ante, at 7, n. 3. But where is the support in the law\nof trespass for this proposition? Dogs’ keen sense of smell\nhas been used in law enforcement for centuries. The\nantiquity of this practice is evidenced by a Scottish law\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nfrom 1318 that made it a crime to “disturb a tracking dog\nor the men coming with it for pursuing thieves or seizing\nmalefactors.” K. Brown et al., The Records of the Parlia-\nments of Scotland to 1707, (St Andrews, 2007–2013),\nonline at http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1318/9. If bringing a\ntracking dog to the front door of a home constituted a\ntrespass, one would expect at least one case to have arisen\nduring the past 800 years. But the Court has found none.\n  For these reasons, the real law of trespass provides no\nsupport for the Court’s holding today. While the Court\nclaims that its reasoning has “ancient and durable\nroots,” ante, at 4, its trespass rule is really a newly struck\ncounterfeit.\n                              III\n   The concurring opinion attempts to provide an alterna-\ntive ground for today’s decision, namely, that Detective\nBartelt’s conduct violated respondent’s reasonable expec-\ntations of privacy. But we have already rejected a very\nsimilar, if not identical argument, see Illinois v. Caballes,\n543 U. S. 405, 409–410 (2005), and in any event I see no\nbasis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have\na reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate\nfrom the dwelling and reach spots where members of the\npublic may lawfully stand.\n   It is clear that the occupant of a house has no reasona-\nble expectation of privacy with respect to odors that can be\nsmelled by human beings who are standing in such places.\nSee United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478, 482 (1985)\n(“After the officers came closer and detected the distinct\nodor of marihuana, they had probable cause to believe\nthat the vehicles contained contraband”); United States\nv. Ventresca, 380 U. S. 102, 111 (1965) (scent of ferment-\ning mash supported probable cause for warrant); United\nStates v. Johnston, 497 F. 2d 397, 398 (CA9 1974) (there\nis no “reasonable expectation of privacy from drug agents\n10                    FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nwith inquisitive nostrils”). And I would not draw a line\nbetween odors that can be smelled by humans and those\nthat are detectible only by dogs.\n   Consider the situation from the point of view of the\noccupant of a building in which marijuana is grown or\nmethamphetamine is manufactured. Would such an oc-\ncupant reason as follows? “I know that odors may ema-\nnate from my building and that atmospheric conditions,\nsuch as the force and direction of the wind, may affect the\nstrength of those odors when they reach a spot where\nmembers of the public may lawfully stand. I also know\nthat some people have a much more acute sense of smell\nthan others,6 and I have no idea who might be standing in\none of the spots in question when the odors from my house\nreach that location. In addition, I know that odors coming\nfrom my building, when they reach these locations, may be\nstrong enough to be detected by a dog. But I am confident\nthat they will be so faint that they cannot be smelled by\nany human being.” Such a finely tuned expectation would\nbe entirely unrealistic, and I see no evidence that society\nis prepared to recognize it as reasonable.\n   In an attempt to show that respondent had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the odor of marijuana wafting\nfrom his house, the concurrence argues that this case is\njust like Kyllo v. United States, 533 U. S. 27 (2001), which\nheld that police officers conducted a search when they\nused a thermal imaging device to detect heat emanating\nfrom a house. Ante, at 3–4 (opinion of KAGAN, J.). This\nCourt, however, has already rejected the argument that\n——————\n  6 Some humans naturally have a much more acute sense of smell\n\nthan others, and humans can be trained to detect and distinguish odors\nthat could not be detected without such training. See E. Hancock, A\nPrimer on Smell, http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/996web/smell.html. Some\nindividuals employed in the perfume and wine industries, for example,\nhave an amazingly acute sense of smell. Ibid.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe use of a drug-sniffing dog is the same as the use of a\nthermal imaging device. See Caballes, 543 U. S., at 409–\n410. The very argument now advanced by the concurrence\nappears in Justice Souter’s Caballes dissent. See id., at\n413, and n. 3. But the Court was not persuaded.\n   Contrary to the interpretation propounded by the con-\ncurrence, Kyllo is best understood as a decision about the\nuse of new technology. The Kyllo Court focused on the fact\nthat the thermal imaging device was a form of “sense-\nenhancing technology” that was “not in general public\nuse,” and it expressed concern that citizens would be “at\nthe mercy of advancing technology” if its use was not\nrestricted. 533 U. S., at 34–35. A dog, however, is not a\nnew form of “technology or a “device.” And, as noted, the\nuse of dogs’ acute sense of smell in law enforcement dates\nback many centuries.\n   The concurrence suggests that a Kyllo-based decision\nwould be “much like” the actual decision of the Court, but\nthat is simply not so. The holding of the Court is based on\nwhat the Court sees as a “ ‘physical intrusion of a constitu-\ntionally protected area.’ ” Ante, at 3 (quoting United States\nv. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276, 286 (1983) (Brennan, J., concur-\nring in judgment)). As a result, it does not apply when a\ndog alerts while on a public sidewalk or street or in the\ncorridor of a building to which the dog and handler have\nbeen lawfully admitted.\n   The concurrence’s Kyllo-based approach would have a\nmuch wider reach. When the police used the thermal\nimaging device in Kyllo, they were on a public street, 533\nU. S., at 29, and “committed no trespass.” Ante, at 3.\nTherefore, if a dog’s nose is just like a thermal imaging\ndevice for Fourth Amendment purposes, a search would\noccur if a dog alerted while on a public sidewalk or in the\ncorridor of an apartment building. And the same would be\ntrue if the dog was trained to sniff, not for marijuana, but\nfor more dangerous quarry, such as explosives or for a\n12                 FLORIDA v. JARDINES\n\n                    ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nviolent fugitive or kidnaped child. I see no ground for\nhampering legitimate law enforcement in this way.\n                            IV\n  The conduct of the police officer in this case did not\nconstitute a trespass and did not violate respondent’s\nreasonable expectations of privacy. I would hold that this\nconduct was not a search, and I therefore respectfully\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/856195/", "sha1": "eef51f94dd97134ca42589c5f450236be9d675a7", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": null, "time_retrieved": "2013-03-26T07:21:14.439413"}
