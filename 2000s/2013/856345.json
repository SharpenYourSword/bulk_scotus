UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n No. 11\u201310362.       Argued February 19, 2013\u2014Decided March 27, 2013\nThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives the Government\u2019s sover-\n  eign immunity from tort suits, but excepts from that waiver certain\n  intentional torts, 28 U. S. C. \u00a72680(h). Section \u00a72680(h), in turn, con-\n  tains a proviso that extends the waiver of immunity to claims for six\n  intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the\n  \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d\n  i.e., a federal officer \u201cwho is empowered by law to execute searches, to\n  seize evidence, or to make arrests.\u201d Petitioner Millbrook, a federal\n  prisoner, sued the United States under the FTCA, alleging, inter alia,\n  assault and battery by correctional officers. The District Court\n  granted the Government summary judgment, and the Third Circuit\n  affirmed, hewing to its precedent that the \u201claw enforcement proviso\u201d\n  applies only to tortious conduct that occurs during the course of exe-\n  cuting a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.\nHeld: The law enforcement proviso extends to law enforcement officers\u2019\n acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, re-\n gardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law\n enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or\n making an arrest. The proviso\u2019s plain language supports this conclu-\n sion. On its face, the proviso applies where a claim arises out of one\n of six intentional torts and is related to the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an\n \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d \u00a72680(h). And by cross-\n referencing \u00a71346(b), the proviso incorporates an additional require-\n ment that the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d occur while the officer is \u201cacting\n within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1). Nothing\n in \u00a72680(h)\u2019s text supports further limiting the proviso to conduct\n arising out of searches, seizures of evidence, or arrests. The FTCA\u2019s\n only reference to those terms is in \u00a72680(h)\u2019s definition of \u201cinvestiga-\n2                   MILLBROOK v.

This confirms that Congress intended im-\n    munity determinations to depend on a federal officer\u2019s legal author-\n    ity, not on a particular exercise of that authority. Nor does the pro-\n    viso indicate that a waiver of immunity requires the officer to be\n    engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity. The text never\n    uses those terms. Had Congress intended to further narrow the\n    waiver\u2019s scope, it could have used language to that effect. See Ali v.\n    Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 227.

UNITED STATES\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                [March 27, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Petitioner Kim Millbrook, a prisoner in the custody of\nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), alleges that correc-\ntional officers sexually assaulted and verbally threatened\nhim while he was in their custody. Millbrook filed suit\nin Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b), 2671\u20132680 (FTCA or Act),\nwhich waives the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from\ntort suits, including those based on certain intentional torts\ncommitted by federal law enforcement officers, \u00a72680(h).\nThe District Court dismissed Millbrook\u2019s action, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. The Court of Appeals held\nthat, while the FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign\nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforcement\nofficers, it only does so when the tortious conduct occurs in\nthe course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or\nmaking an arrest. Petitioner contends that the FTCA\u2019s\nwaiver is not so limited. We agree and reverse the judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because no party defends the judgment, we appointed Jeffrey S.\n\nBucholtz to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of\nthe judgment below. 568 U. S. ___ (2012). Amicus Bucholtz has ably\n2                MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The FTCA \u201cwas designed primarily to remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort.\u201d\nLevin v. United States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Act gives\nfederal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the United States for \u201cinjury or loss of property,\nor personal injury or death caused by the negligent or\nwrongful act or omission\u201d of a federal employee \u201cacting\nwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71346(b)(1). This broad waiver of sovereign immunity is\nsubject to a number of exceptions set forth in \u00a72680. One\nsuch exception, relating to intentional torts, preserves the\nGovernment\u2019s immunity from suit for \u201c[a]ny claim arising\nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest,\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract\nrights.\u201d \u00a72680(h). We have referred to \u00a72680(h) as the\n\u201cintentional tort exception.\u201d Levin, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In 1974, Congress carved out an exception to \u00a72680(h)\u2019s\npreservation of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity\nfor intentional torts by adding a proviso covering claims\nthat arise out of the wrongful conduct of law enforcement\nofficers. See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. L. 93\u2013253, \u00a72, 88\nStat. 50. Known as the \u201claw enforcement proviso,\u201d this\nprovision extends the waiver of sovereign immunity to\nclaims for six intentional torts, including assault and\nbattery, that are based on the \u201cacts or omissions of inves-\ntigative or law enforcement officers.\u201d \u00a72680(h). The pro-\nviso defines \u201c \u2018investigative or law enforcement officer\u2019 \u201d to\nmean \u201cany officer of the United States who is empowered\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndischarged his assigned responsibilities, and the Court thanks him for\n\nhis well-stated arguments. \n\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

In his complaint, Millbrook\nalleged that, on March 5, 2010, he was forced to per-\nform oral sex on a BOP correctional officer, while another\nofficer held him in a choke hold and a third officer stood\nwatch nearby. Millbrook claimed that the officers threat-\nened to kill him if he did not comply with their demands.\nMillbrook alleged that he suffered physical injuries as a\nresult of the incident and, accordingly, sought compensa-\ntory damages.\n  The Government argued that the FTCA did not waive\nthe United States\u2019 sovereign immunity from suit on\nMillbrook\u2019s intentional tort claims, because they fell with-\nin the intentional tort exception in \u00a72680(h). The Govern-\nment contended that \u00a72680(h)\u2019s law enforcement proviso\ndid not save Millbrook\u2019s claims because of the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s binding precedent in Pooler v. United States, 787\nF. 2d 868 (1986), which interpreted the proviso to apply\nonly to tortious conduct that occurred during the course\nof \u201cexecuting a search, seizing evidence, or making an ar-\nrest.\u201d Id., at 872. The District Court agreed and granted\nsummary judgment for the United States because the\nalleged conduct \u201cdid not take place during an arrest,\nsearch, or seizure of evidence.\u201d Civ. Action No. 3:11\u2013cv\u2013\n00131 (MD Pa., Feb. 16, 2012), App. 96.2 The Third Cir-\ncuit affirmed. 477 Fed. Appx. 4, 5\u20136 (2012) (per curiam).\n  We granted certiorari, 567 U.

This issue is not before us.\n4              MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintentionally tortious conduct by law enforcement officers\ncan give rise to an actionable claim under the FTCA.\nCompare Pooler, supra; and Orsay v. United States Dept.\nof Justice, 289 F. 3d 1125, 1136 (CA9 2002) (law enforce-\nment proviso \u201creaches only those claims asserting that the\ntort occurred in the course of investigative or law enforce-\nment activities\u201d (emphasis added)); with Ignacio v. United\nStates, 674 F. 3d 252, 256 (CA4 2012) (holding that the\nlaw enforcement proviso \u201cwaives immunity whenever an\ninvestigative or law enforcement officer commits one of the\nspecified intentional torts, regardless of whether the officer\nis engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n                            II\n  The FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immu-\nnity for certain intentional torts committed by law en-\nforcement officers. The portion of the Act relevant here\nprovides:\n       \u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b)\n    of this title shall not apply to\u2014\n      .           .            .             .        .\n        \u201c(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\n    imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,\n    abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\n    ceit, or interference with contract rights: Provided,\n    That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative\n    or law enforcement officers of the United States Gov-\n    ernment, the provisions of this chapter and section\n    1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising\n    . . . out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false\n    arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.\u201d 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72680(h).\nOn its face, the law enforcement proviso applies where a\nclaim both arises out of one of the proviso\u2019s six intentional\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntorts, and is related to the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an \u201cinves-\ntigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d The proviso\u2019s cross-\nreference to \u00a71346(b) incorporates an additional require-\nment that the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim\noccur while the officer is \u201cacting within the scope of his\noffice or employment.\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1). The question in this\ncase is whether the FTCA further limits the category\nof \u201cacts or omissions\u201d that trigger the United States\u2019\nliability.3\n   The plain language of the law enforcement proviso\nanswers when a law enforcement officer\u2019s \u201cacts or omis-\nsions\u201d may give rise to an actionable tort claim under the\nFTCA. The proviso specifies that the conduct must arise\nfrom one of the six enumerated intentional torts and,\nby expressly cross-referencing \u00a71346(b), indicates that the\nlaw enforcement officer\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions\u201d must fall\n\u201cwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72680(h),\n1346(b)(1). Nothing in the text further qualifies the cate-\ngory of \u201cacts or omissions\u201d that may trigger FTCA liability.\n   A number of lower courts have nevertheless read into\nthe text additional limitations designed to narrow the\nscope of the law enforcement proviso. The Ninth Circuit,\nfor instance, held that the law enforcement proviso does\nnot apply unless the tort was \u201ccommitted in the course of\ninvestigative or law enforcement activities.\u201d Orsay, supra,\nat 1135. As noted, the Third Circuit construed the law\nenforcement proviso even more narrowly in holding that it\napplies only to tortious conduct by federal officers during\nthe course of \u201cexecuting a search, seizing evidence, or\nmaking an arrest.\u201d Pooler, 787 F. 2d, at 872. Court-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Government conceded in the proceedings below that the correc-\n\ntional officer whose alleged conduct is at issue was acting within the\nscope of his employment and that the named correctional officers\nqualify as \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers\u201d within the mean-\ning of the FTCA. App. 54\u201355, 84\u201385; Brief for United States 30.\nAccordingly, we express no opinion on either of these issues.\n6               MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nappointed amicus curiae (Amicus) similarly asks us to\nconstrue the proviso to waive \u201csovereign immunity only for\ntorts committed by federal officers acting in their capacity\nas \u2018investigative or law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nAmicus 5. Under this approach, the conduct of federal\nofficers would be actionable only when it \u201caris[es] out of\nsearches, seizures of evidence, arrests, and closely related\nexercises of investigative or law-enforcement authority.\u201d\nIbid.\n  None of these interpretations finds any support in the\ntext of the statute. The FTCA\u2019s only reference to \u201csearches,\u201d\n\u201cseiz[ures of ] evidence,\u201d and \u201carrests\u201d is found in the\nstatutory definition of \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement\nofficer.\u201d \u00a72680(h) (defining \u201c \u2018investigative or law enforce-\nment officer\u2019 \u201d to mean any federal officer who is \u201cempow-\nered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to\nmake arrests for violations of Federal law\u201d). By its terms,\nthis provision focuses on the status of persons whose con-\nduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that\nmay give rise to a tort claim against the United States.\nThe proviso thus distinguishes between the acts for which\nimmunity is waived (e.g., assault and battery), and the\nclass of persons whose acts may give rise to an actionable\nFTCA claim. The plain text confirms that Congress in-\ntended immunity determinations to depend on a federal\nofficer\u2019s legal authority, not on a particular exercise of that\nauthority. Consequently, there is no basis for concluding\nthat a law enforcement officer\u2019s intentional tort must oc-\ncur in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence,\nor making an arrest in order to subject the United States\nto liability.\n  Nor does the text of the proviso provide any indication\nthat the officer must be engaged in \u201cinvestigative or law\nenforcement activity.\u201d Indeed, the text never uses the\nterm. Amicus contends that we should read the reference\nto \u201cinvestigative or law-enforcement officer\u201d as implicitly\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimiting the proviso to claims arising from actions taken\nin an officer\u2019s investigative or law enforcement capacity.\nBut there is no basis for so limiting the term when Con-\ngress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which a\nlaw enforcement officer\u2019s conduct may expose the United\nStates to tort liability. Under the proviso, an intentional\ntort is not actionable unless it occurs while the law en-\nforcement officer is \u201cacting within the scope of his office or\nemployment.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72680(h), 1346(b)(1). Had Congress in-\ntended to further narrow the scope of the proviso, Con-\ngress could have limited it to claims arising from \u201cacts or\nomissions of investigative or law enforcement officers\nacting in a law enforcement or investigative capacity.\u201d See\nAli v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 227 (2008).\nCongress adopted similar limitations in neighboring provi-\nsions, see \u00a72680(a) (referring to \u201c[a]ny claim based upon\nan act or omission of an employee of the Government . . .\nin the execution of a statute or regulation\u201d (emphasis\nadded)), but did not do so here. We, therefore, decline to\nread such a limitation into unambiguous text. Jimenez v.\nQuarterman, 555 U. S. 113, 118 (2009) (\u201c[W]hen the statu-\ntory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its\nterms\u201d); Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450\n(2002) (\u201cThe inquiry ceases if the statutory language is\nunambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and\nconsistent\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                        *    *    *\n  We hold that the waiver effected by the law enforcement\nproviso extends to acts or omissions of law enforcement\nofficers that arise within the scope of their employment,\nregardless of whether the officers are engaged in investi-\ngative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a\nsearch, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.

Section \u00a72680(h), in turn, con-\n  tains a proviso that extends the waiver of immunity to claims for six\n  intentional torts, including assault and battery, that are based on the\n  \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d\n  i.e., a federal officer \u201cwho is empowered by law to execute searches, to\n  seize evidence, or to make arrests.\u201d Petitioner Millbrook, a federal\n  prisoner, sued the United States under the FTCA, alleging, inter alia,\n  assault and battery by correctional officers. The District Court\n  granted the Government summary judgment, and the Third Circuit\n  affirmed, hewing to its precedent that the \u201claw enforcement proviso\u201d\n  applies only to tortious conduct that occurs during the course of exe-\n  cuting a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.\nHeld: The law enforcement proviso extends to law enforcement officers\u2019\n acts or omissions that arise within the scope of their employment, re-\n gardless of whether the officers are engaged in investigative or law\n enforcement activity, or are executing a search, seizing evidence, or\n making an arrest. The proviso\u2019s plain language supports this conclu-\n sion. On its face, the proviso applies where a claim arises out of one\n of six intentional torts and is related to the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an\n \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d \u00a72680(h). And by cross-\n referencing \u00a71346(b), the proviso incorporates an additional require-\n ment that the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d occur while the officer is \u201cacting\n within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1). Nothing\n in \u00a72680(h)\u2019s text supports further limiting the proviso to conduct\n arising out of searches, seizures of evidence, or arrests. The FTCA\u2019s\n only reference to those terms is in \u00a72680(h)\u2019s definition of \u201cinvestiga-\n2                   MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tive or law enforcement officer,\u201d which focuses on the status of per-\n    sons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that\n    may give rise to a claim. This confirms that Congress intended im-\n    munity determinations to depend on a federal officer\u2019s legal author-\n    ity, not on a particular exercise of that authority. Nor does the pro-\n    viso indicate that a waiver of immunity requires the officer to be\n    engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity. The text never\n    uses those terms. Had Congress intended to further narrow the\n    waiver\u2019s scope, it could have used language to that effect. See Ali v.\n    Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 227.

Millbrook filed suit\nin Federal District Court under the Federal Tort Claims\nAct, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71346(b), 2671\u20132680 (FTCA or Act),\nwhich waives the Government\u2019s sovereign immunity from\ntort suits, including those based on certain intentional torts\ncommitted by federal law enforcement officers, \u00a72680(h).\nThe District Court dismissed Millbrook\u2019s action, and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. The Court of Appeals held\nthat, while the FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign\nimmunity for certain intentional torts by law enforcement\nofficers, it only does so when the tortious conduct occurs in\nthe course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or\nmaking an arrest. Petitioner contends that the FTCA\u2019s\nwaiver is not so limited. We agree and reverse the judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Because no party defends the judgment, we appointed Jeffrey S.\n\nBucholtz to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of\nthe judgment below. 568 U.

UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   The FTCA \u201cwas designed primarily to remove the sover-\neign immunity of the United States from suits in tort.\u201d\nLevin v. United States, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,\nat 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Act gives\nfederal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims\nagainst the United States for \u201cinjury or loss of property,\nor personal injury or death caused by the negligent or\nwrongful act or omission\u201d of a federal employee \u201cacting\nwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71346(b)(1). This broad waiver of sovereign immunity is\nsubject to a number of exceptions set forth in \u00a72680. One\nsuch exception, relating to intentional torts, preserves the\nGovernment\u2019s immunity from suit for \u201c[a]ny claim arising\nout of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest,\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander,\nmisrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract\nrights.\u201d \u00a72680(h). We have referred to \u00a72680(h) as the\n\u201cintentional tort exception.\u201d Levin, supra, at ___ (slip op.,\nat 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In 1974, Congress carved out an exception to \u00a72680(h)\u2019s\npreservation of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity\nfor intentional torts by adding a proviso covering claims\nthat arise out of the wrongful conduct of law enforcement\nofficers. See Act of Mar. 16, 1974, Pub. L. 93\u2013253, \u00a72, 88\nStat. 50. Known as the \u201claw enforcement proviso,\u201d this\nprovision extends the waiver of sovereign immunity to\nclaims for six intentional torts, including assault and\nbattery, that are based on the \u201cacts or omissions of inves-\ntigative or law enforcement officers.\u201d \u00a72680(h). The pro-\nviso defines \u201c \u2018investigative or law enforcement officer\u2019 \u201d to\nmean \u201cany officer of the United States who is empowered\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\ndischarged his assigned responsibilities, and the Court thanks him for\n\nhis well-stated arguments. \n\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

In his complaint, Millbrook\nalleged that, on March 5, 2010, he was forced to per-\nform oral sex on a BOP correctional officer, while another\nofficer held him in a choke hold and a third officer stood\nwatch nearby. Millbrook claimed that the officers threat-\nened to kill him if he did not comply with their demands.\nMillbrook alleged that he suffered physical injuries as a\nresult of the incident and, accordingly, sought compensa-\ntory damages.\n  The Government argued that the FTCA did not waive\nthe United States\u2019 sovereign immunity from suit on\nMillbrook\u2019s intentional tort claims, because they fell with-\nin the intentional tort exception in \u00a72680(h). The Govern-\nment contended that \u00a72680(h)\u2019s law enforcement proviso\ndid not save Millbrook\u2019s claims because of the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s binding precedent in Pooler v. United States, 787\nF. 2d 868 (1986), which interpreted the proviso to apply\nonly to tortious conduct that occurred during the course\nof \u201cexecuting a search, seizing evidence, or making an ar-\nrest.\u201d Id., at 872. The District Court agreed and granted\nsummary judgment for the United States because the\nalleged conduct \u201cdid not take place during an arrest,\nsearch, or seizure of evidence.\u201d Civ.

This issue is not before us.\n4              MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nintentionally tortious conduct by law enforcement officers\ncan give rise to an actionable claim under the FTCA.\nCompare Pooler, supra; and Orsay v. United States Dept.\nof Justice, 289 F. 3d 1125, 1136 (CA9 2002) (law enforce-\nment proviso \u201creaches only those claims asserting that the\ntort occurred in the course of investigative or law enforce-\nment activities\u201d (emphasis added)); with Ignacio v. United\nStates, 674 F. 3d 252, 256 (CA4 2012) (holding that the\nlaw enforcement proviso \u201cwaives immunity whenever an\ninvestigative or law enforcement officer commits one of the\nspecified intentional torts, regardless of whether the officer\nis engaged in investigative or law enforcement activity\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n                            II\n  The FTCA waives the United States\u2019 sovereign immu-\nnity for certain intentional torts committed by law en-\nforcement officers. The portion of the Act relevant here\nprovides:\n       \u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b)\n    of this title shall not apply to\u2014\n      .           .            .             .        .\n        \u201c(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false\n    imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution,\n    abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, de-\n    ceit, or interference with contract rights: Provided,\n    That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative\n    or law enforcement officers of the United States Gov-\n    ernment, the provisions of this chapter and section\n    1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising\n    . . . out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false\n    arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.\u201d 28\n    U. S. C. \u00a72680(h).\nOn its face, the law enforcement proviso applies where a\nclaim both arises out of one of the proviso\u2019s six intentional\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntorts, and is related to the \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of an \u201cinves-\ntigative or law enforcement officer.\u201d The proviso\u2019s cross-\nreference to \u00a71346(b) incorporates an additional require-\nment that the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim\noccur while the officer is \u201cacting within the scope of his\noffice or employment.\u201d \u00a71346(b)(1). The question in this\ncase is whether the FTCA further limits the category\nof \u201cacts or omissions\u201d that trigger the United States\u2019\nliability.3\n   The plain language of the law enforcement proviso\nanswers when a law enforcement officer\u2019s \u201cacts or omis-\nsions\u201d may give rise to an actionable tort claim under the\nFTCA. The proviso specifies that the conduct must arise\nfrom one of the six enumerated intentional torts and,\nby expressly cross-referencing \u00a71346(b), indicates that the\nlaw enforcement officer\u2019s \u201cacts or omissions\u201d must fall\n\u201cwithin the scope of his office or employment.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72680(h),\n1346(b)(1). Nothing in the text further qualifies the cate-\ngory of \u201cacts or omissions\u201d that may trigger FTCA liability.\n   A number of lower courts have nevertheless read into\nthe text additional limitations designed to narrow the\nscope of the law enforcement proviso. The Ninth Circuit,\nfor instance, held that the law enforcement proviso does\nnot apply unless the tort was \u201ccommitted in the course of\ninvestigative or law enforcement activities.\u201d Orsay, supra,\nat 1135. As noted, the Third Circuit construed the law\nenforcement proviso even more narrowly in holding that it\napplies only to tortious conduct by federal officers during\nthe course of \u201cexecuting a search, seizing evidence, or\nmaking an arrest.\u201d Pooler, 787 F. 2d, at 872. Court-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Government conceded in the proceedings below that the correc-\n\ntional officer whose alleged conduct is at issue was acting within the\nscope of his employment and that the named correctional officers\nqualify as \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers\u201d within the mean-\ning of the FTCA. App. 54\u201355, 84\u201385; Brief for United States 30.\nAccordingly, we express no opinion on either of these issues.\n6               MILLBROOK v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nappointed amicus curiae (Amicus) similarly asks us to\nconstrue the proviso to waive \u201csovereign immunity only for\ntorts committed by federal officers acting in their capacity\nas \u2018investigative or law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nAmicus 5. Under this approach, the conduct of federal\nofficers would be actionable only when it \u201caris[es] out of\nsearches, seizures of evidence, arrests, and closely related\nexercises of investigative or law-enforcement authority.\u201d\nIbid.\n  None of these interpretations finds any support in the\ntext of the statute. The FTCA\u2019s only reference to \u201csearches,\u201d\n\u201cseiz[ures of ] evidence,\u201d and \u201carrests\u201d is found in the\nstatutory definition of \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement\nofficer.\u201d \u00a72680(h) (defining \u201c \u2018investigative or law enforce-\nment officer\u2019 \u201d to mean any federal officer who is \u201cempow-\nered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to\nmake arrests for violations of Federal law\u201d). By its terms,\nthis provision focuses on the status of persons whose con-\nduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that\nmay give rise to a tort claim against the United States.\nThe proviso thus distinguishes between the acts for which\nimmunity is waived (e.g., assault and battery), and the\nclass of persons whose acts may give rise to an actionable\nFTCA claim. The plain text confirms that Congress in-\ntended immunity determinations to depend on a federal\nofficer\u2019s legal authority, not on a particular exercise of that\nauthority. Consequently, there is no basis for concluding\nthat a law enforcement officer\u2019s intentional tort must oc-\ncur in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence,\nor making an arrest in order to subject the United States\nto liability.\n  Nor does the text of the proviso provide any indication\nthat the officer must be engaged in \u201cinvestigative or law\nenforcement activity.\u201d Indeed, the text never uses the\nterm. Amicus contends that we should read the reference\nto \u201cinvestigative or law-enforcement officer\u201d as implicitly\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimiting the proviso to claims arising from actions taken\nin an officer\u2019s investigative or law enforcement capacity.\nBut there is no basis for so limiting the term when Con-\ngress has spoken directly to the circumstances in which a\nlaw enforcement officer\u2019s conduct may expose the United\nStates to tort liability. Under the proviso, an intentional\ntort is not actionable unless it occurs while the law en-\nforcement officer is \u201cacting within the scope of his office or\nemployment.\u201d \u00a7\u00a72680(h), 1346(b)(1). Had Congress in-\ntended to further narrow the scope of the proviso, Con-\ngress could have limited it to claims arising from \u201cacts or\nomissions of investigative or law enforcement officers\nacting in a law enforcement or investigative capacity.\u201d See\nAli v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 227 (2008).\nCongress adopted similar limitations in neighboring provi-\nsions, see \u00a72680(a) (referring to \u201c[a]ny claim based upon\nan act or omission of an employee of the Government . . .\nin the execution of a statute or regulation\u201d (emphasis\nadded)), but did not do so here. We, therefore, decline to\nread such a limitation into unambiguous text. Jimenez v.\nQuarterman, 555 U. S. 113, 118 (2009) (\u201c[W]hen the statu-\ntory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its\nterms\u201d); Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450\n(2002) (\u201cThe inquiry ceases if the statutory language is\nunambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and\nconsistent\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n                        *    *    *\n  We hold that the waiver effected by the law enforcement\nproviso extends to acts or omissions of law enforcement\nofficers that arise within the scope of their employment,\nregardless of whether the officers are engaged in investi-\ngative or law enforcement activity, or are executing a\nsearch, seizing evidence, or making an arrest. Accord-\ningly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with\n8               MILLBROOK v.
