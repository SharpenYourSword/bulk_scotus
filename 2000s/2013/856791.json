OTIS LEE RODGERS\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n               No. 12\u2013382.    Decided April 1, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state con-\nviction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California.\nHe claimed the state courts violated his Sixth Amendment\nright to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap-\npoint an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new\ntrial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right\nto counseled representation. The District Court denied\nrespondent\u2019s petition, and he appealed to the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas\nrelief. 678 F. 3d 1149, 1163 (2012). Because the Court\nof Appeals erred in concluding that respondent\u2019s claim is\nsupported by \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1), its judgment must be reversed.\n                              I\n  In 2001, the State of California charged respondent with\nmaking criminal threats, assault with a firearm, and be-\ning a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.\nBefore his arraignment, respondent executed a valid\nwaiver of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, electing\nto represent himself. See Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.\n806, 807 (1975). By the time of his preliminary hearing,\nhowever, respondent changed his mind and retained coun-\nsel. Then, two months later, he fired his lawyer and again\nwaived his right to counsel. Two months after that, re-\nspondent again changed his mind and asked the court to\n2                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nappoint an attorney. The court did so. Shortly before\ntrial, however, respondent for the third time surrendered\nhis right to counsel. He proceeded to trial pro se. On June\n27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\n   After the verdict was read, respondent asked the state\ntrial court to provide an attorney to help him file a motion\nfor a new trial. The trial judge deferred ruling on the\nmotion to appoint counsel, and respondent later renewed\nthe request in writing. Neither the oral nor the written\nmotion included reasons in support of his request; and\nwhen offered a chance to supplement or explain his motion\nat a later hearing, respondent declined to do so. The trial\ncourt denied the request for counsel. Respondent\u2019s pro se\nmotion for a new trial was likewise denied.\n   On direct review the California Court of Appeal affirmed\nrespondent\u2019s convictions and sentence. As relevant here,\nit concluded that his history of vacillating between coun-\nseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his\nmotion, his demonstrated competence in defending his\ncase, and his insistence that he \u201c \u2018c[ould] do the motion\n[him]self \u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018just need[ed] time to perfect it,\u2019 \u201d App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 129\u2013130, justified the trial court\u2019s denial\nof his post-trial request for counsel. The state appellate\ncourt also distinguished its decision from that of the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Menefield v. Borg, 881\nF. 2d 696 (1989), reasoning that the habeas petitioner\nin Menefield had stated reasons justifying his request\nfor counsel, whereas respondent\u2019s request was unreasoned\nand unexplained. The state appellate court concluded that\n\u201c[b]ecause the [trial] court was not given any reason to\ngrant [respondent\u2019s] motion, we cannot find that the court\nabused its discretion in declining to do so.\u201d App. to Pet. for\nCert. 130.\n   Having failed to obtain relief in state court, respondent\nfiled a federal habeas petition, arguing that the California\ncourts had violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\nby not providing an attorney to help with his new-trial\nmotion. The District Court denied the petition but granted\na certificate of appealability. The Court of Appeals re-\nversed, holding that respondent\u2019s \u201cSixth Amendment\nright to counsel was violated when the trial court denied\nhis timely request for representation for a new trial mo-\ntion.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 1163.\n   To reach the conclusion that respondent\u2019s right to coun-\nsel in these circumstances was clearly established by the\nSupreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit invoked certain Sixth Amendment\nprecedents from its own earlier cases and from cases in\nother Circuits. From those precedents, the panel identi-\nfied two relevant principles that it deemed to have been\nclearly established by this Court\u2019s cases: first, that a de-\nfendant\u2019s waiver of his right to trial counsel does not bar\nhis later election to receive assistance of counsel at a later\ncritical stage of the prosecution, absent proof by the State\nthat the reappointment request was made in bad faith, see\nid., at 1159\u20131162; and, second, that a new-trial motion is a\ncritical stage, see id., at 1156\u20131159. Combining these two\npropositions, the court held that respondent had a clearly\nestablished right to the reappointment of counsel for\npurposes of his new-trial motion, and that the California\ncourts\u2014which vest the trial judge with discretion to ap-\nprove or deny such requests based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, see People v. Lawley, 27 Cal. 4th 102, 147\u2013\n151, 38 P. 3d 461, 493\u2013495 (2002)\u2014violated that right by\nrefusing to order the reappointment of counsel. 678 F. 3d,\nat 1162\u20131163.\n                            II\n  The starting point for cases subject to \u00a72254(d)(1) is to\nidentify the \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d that\ngoverns the habeas petitioner\u2019s claims. See Williams v.\n4                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412 (2000); Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n556 U. S. 111, 122 (2009). As indicated above, the parties\nhere dispute whether two principles of law are clearly\nestablished under this framework. One is whether, after a\ndefendant\u2019s valid waiver of his right to trial counsel under\nFaretta, a post-trial, preappeal motion for a new trial is a\ncritical stage of the prosecution. For purposes of analysis\nhere, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is.\n  The other disputed question is whether, after a defend-\nant\u2019s valid waiver of counsel, a trial judge has discretion\nto deny the defendant\u2019s later request for reappointment of\ncounsel. In resolving this question in respondent\u2019s favor,\nthe Court of Appeals first concluded (correctly) that \u201cthe\nSupreme Court has never explicitly addressed a criminal\ndefendant\u2019s ability to re-assert his right to counsel\u201d once\nhe has validly waived it. 678 F. 3d, at 1159 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). It then (also correctly) recog-\nnized that the lack of a Supreme Court decision on nearly\nidentical facts does not by itself mean that there is no\nclearly established federal law, since \u201ca general standard\u201d\nfrom this Court\u2019s cases can supply such law. Yarborough\nv. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652, 664 (2004). The Court of Ap-\npeals erred, however, in its application of this latter prop-\nosition to the controlling issues here.\n  It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment safe-\nguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to\ncounsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.\u201d Iowa\nv. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 80\u201381 (2004); see United States v.\nCronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653\u2013654 (1984); Gideon v. Wain-\nwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963). It is just as well settled,\nhowever, that a defendant also has the right to \u201cproceed\nwithout counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently\nelects to do so.\u201d Faretta, 422 U. S., at 807.\n  There can be some tension in these two principles. As\nthe Faretta Court observed, \u201c[t]here can be no blinking the\nfact that the right of an accused to conduct his own de-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nfense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions holding that the Constitution requires that no\naccused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has\nbeen accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d Id.,\nat 832. California has resolved this tension by adopting\nthe framework under review. Under that approach, trial\njudges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver\nrequests for counsel; their decisions on such requests\nmust be based on the totality of the circumstances, \u201cin-\nclud[ing] \u2018the quality of [the defendant\u2019s] representation\nof [himself], the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute\ncounsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage\nof the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that]\nmight reasonably be expected to follow the granting of\nsuch a motion.\u2019 \u201d Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P. 3d, at 494\n(quoting People v. Windham, 19 Cal. 3d 121, 128, 560\nP. 2d 1187, 1191\u20131192 (1977); final alteration in original).\nThe state appellate court applied those rules to the case at\nbar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances\u2014and\nespecially the shifting nature of respondent\u2019s preferences,\nthe unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated\ncapacity to handle the incidents of trial\u2014supported the\ntrial court\u2019s decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 128\u2013131.\n   The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that ten-\nsion differently in its own direct-review cases. It has\nadopted a \u201c \u2018strong presumption that a defendant\u2019s post-\ntrial request for the assistance of an attorney should not\nbe refused,\u2019 \u201d 678 F. 3d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Igna-\ncio, 360 F. 3d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted),\nas well as a default rule that, \u201c \u2018in the absence of extraor-\ndinary circumstances,\u2019 a defendant\u2019s post-trial revocation\nof his waiver should be allowed unless the government can\nshow that the request is made \u2018for a bad faith purpose,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F. 2d, at 701; empha-\nsis deleted).\n   It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the\n6                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmerits of these two approaches or determine what rule the\nSixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver re-\nquests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires\u2014\nand all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under\n\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014is to observe that, in light of the tension\nbetween the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201cthe right\nto counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,\u201d\nTovar, supra, at 80\u201381, and its concurrent promise of \u201ca\nconstitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a\ncriminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to\ndo so,\u201d Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap-\nplication of the \u201cgeneral standard[s]\u201d established by the\nCourt\u2019s assistance-of-counsel cases. Alvarado, supra, at\n664.\n  The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion rested in part\non the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used\nto refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court\njurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has\nnot announced. Parker v. Matthews, 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) ( per curiam) (slip op., at 12\u201313) (\u201cThe highly gener-\nalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial\nmisconduct set forth in Darden [v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\n168 (1986)] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate,\nmultistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here\u201d); see\n678 F. 3d, at 1155, 1157. The error in this approach is\nsubtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate panel may,\nin accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures,\nlook to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has al-\nready held that the particular point in issue is clearly\nestablished by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver\nv.

S. 766, 778\u2013779 (2010). The Court of Appeals\nfailed to abide by that limitation here. Its resulting hold-\ning was erroneous and must be reversed.\n                             III\n   The Court expresses no view on the merits of the under-\nlying Sixth Amendment principle the respondent urges.\nAnd it does not suggest or imply that the underlying issue,\nif presented on direct review, would be insubstantial. This\nopinion is instead confined to the determination that the\nconclusion of the California courts that there was no Sixth\nAmendment violation is not contrary to \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.

Decided April 1, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Otis Lee Rodgers, challenging his state con-\nviction, sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California.\nHe claimed the state courts violated his Sixth Amendment\nright to effective assistance of counsel by declining to ap-\npoint an attorney to assist in filing a motion for a new\ntrial notwithstanding his three prior waivers of the right\nto counseled representation. The District Court denied\nrespondent\u2019s petition, and he appealed to the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, which granted habeas\nrelief. 678 F. 3d 1149, 1163 (2012). Because the Court\nof Appeals erred in concluding that respondent\u2019s claim is\nsupported by \u201cclearly established Federal law, as deter-\nmined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28\nU.

The Court of Ap-\npeals erred, however, in its application of this latter prop-\nosition to the controlling issues here.\n  It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment safe-\nguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to\ncounsel at all critical stages of the criminal process.\u201d Iowa\nv. Tovar, 541 U. S. 77, 80\u201381 (2004); see United States v.\nCronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653\u2013654 (1984); Gideon v. Wain-\nwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344 (1963). It is just as well settled,\nhowever, that a defendant also has the right to \u201cproceed\nwithout counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently\nelects to do so.\u201d Faretta, 422 U.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nfense seems to cut against the grain of this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions holding that the Constitution requires that no\naccused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has\nbeen accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.\u201d Id.,\nat 832. California has resolved this tension by adopting\nthe framework under review. Under that approach, trial\njudges are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver\nrequests for counsel; their decisions on such requests\nmust be based on the totality of the circumstances, \u201cin-\nclud[ing] \u2018the quality of [the defendant\u2019s] representation\nof [himself], the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute\ncounsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage\nof the proceedings, and the disruption or delay [that]\nmight reasonably be expected to follow the granting of\nsuch a motion.\u2019 \u201d Lawley, supra, at 149, 38 P. 3d, at 494\n(quoting People v. Windham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1222150\"><a href=\"/cal/7giy/people-v-windham/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128, 560\nP. 2d 1187, 1191\u20131192 (1977); final alteration in original).\nThe state appellate court applied those rules to the case at\nbar, concluding that the totality of the circumstances\u2014and\nespecially the shifting nature of respondent\u2019s preferences,\nthe unexplained nature of his motion, and his demonstrated\ncapacity to handle the incidents of trial\u2014supported the\ntrial court\u2019s decision. App. to Pet. for Cert. 128\u2013131.\n   The Court of Appeals, however, has resolved that ten-\nsion differently in its own direct-review cases. It has\nadopted a \u201c \u2018strong presumption that a defendant\u2019s post-\ntrial request for the assistance of an attorney should not\nbe refused,\u2019 \u201d 678 F. 3d, at 1160 (quoting Robinson v. Igna-\ncio, 360 F. 3d 1044, 1058 (CA9 2004); emphasis deleted),\nas well as a default rule that, \u201c \u2018in the absence of extraor-\ndinary circumstances,\u2019 a defendant\u2019s post-trial revocation\nof his waiver should be allowed unless the government can\nshow that the request is made \u2018for a bad faith purpose,\u2019 \u201d\nid., at 1058 (quoting Menefield, 881 F. 2d, at 701; empha-\nsis deleted).\n   It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the\n6                  MARSHALL v. RODGERS\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\nmerits of these two approaches or determine what rule the\nSixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver re-\nquests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires\u2014\nand all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under\n\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2014is to observe that, in light of the tension\nbetween the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of \u201cthe right\nto counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,\u201d\nTovar, supra, at 80\u201381, and its concurrent promise of \u201ca\nconstitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a\ncriminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to\ndo so,\u201d Faretta, supra, at 807, it cannot be said that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s approach is contrary to or an unreasonable ap-\nplication of the \u201cgeneral standard[s]\u201d established by the\nCourt\u2019s assistance-of-counsel cases. Alvarado, supra, at\n664.\n  The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion rested in part\non the mistaken belief that circuit precedent may be used\nto refine or sharpen a general principle of Supreme Court\njurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has\nnot announced. Parker v. Matthews, 567 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) ( per curiam) (slip op., at 12\u201313) (\u201cThe highly gener-\nalized standard for evaluating claims of prosecutorial\nmisconduct set forth in Darden [v. Wainwright, 477 U. S.\n168 (1986)] bears scant resemblance to the elaborate,\nmultistep test employed by the Sixth Circuit here\u201d); see\n678 F. 3d, at 1155, 1157. The error in this approach is\nsubtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate panel may,\nin accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures,\nlook to circuit precedent to ascertain whether it has al-\nready held that the particular point in issue is clearly\nestablished by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., Tolliver\nv. Sheets, 594 F. 3d 900, 916, n. 6 (CA6 2010) (\u201cWe are\nbound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule\nhas been clearly established\u201d); Chambers v. McDaniel, 549\nF. 3d 1191, 1199 (CA9 2008), it may not canvass circuit\ndecisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

S. 766, 778\u2013779 (2010). The Court of Appeals\nfailed to abide by that limitation here. Its resulting hold-\ning was erroneous and must be reversed.\n                             III\n   The Court expresses no view on the merits of the under-\nlying Sixth Amendment principle the respondent urges.\nAnd it does not suggest or imply that the underlying issue,\nif presented on direct review, would be insubstantial. This\nopinion is instead confined to the determination that the\nconclusion of the California courts that there was no Sixth\nAmendment violation is not contrary to \u201cclearly estab-\nlished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States.\u201d \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\njudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
