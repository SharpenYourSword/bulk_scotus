MCCUTCHEN ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11\u20131285. Argued November 27, 2012\u2014Decided April 16, 2013\nThe health benefits plan established by petitioner US Airways paid\n  $66,866 in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent\n  McCutchen, a US Airways employee, in a car accident caused by a\n  third party. The plan entitled US Airways to reimbursement if\n  McCutchen later recovered money from the third party. McCutchen\u2019s\n  attorneys secured $110,000 in payments, and McCutchen received\n  $66,000 after deducting the lawyers\u2019 40% contingency fee. US Air-\n  ways demanded reimbursement of the full $66,866 it had paid. When\n  McCutchen did not comply, US Airways filed suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) of\n  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n  which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action\n  \u201cto obtain . . . appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms\n  of the plan.\u201d McCutchen raised two defenses to US Airways\u2019 request\n  for an equitable lien on the $66,866 it demanded: that, absent over-\n  recovery on his part, US Airways\u2019 right to reimbursement did not\n  kick in; and that US Airways had to contribute its fair share to the\n  costs he incurred to get his recovery, so any reimbursement had to be\n  reduced by 40%, to cover the contingency fee. Rejecting both argu-\n  ments, the District Court granted summary judgment to US Airways.\n  The Third Circuit vacated. Reasoning that traditional \u201cequitable\n  doctrines and defenses\u201d applied to \u00a7502(a)(3) suits, it held that the\n  principle of unjust enrichment overrode US Airways\u2019 reimbursement\n  clause because the clause would leave McCutchen with less than full\n  payment for his medical bills and would give US Airways a windfall.\n2                US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. In a \u00a7502(a)(3) action based on an equitable lien by agreement\u2014\n like this one\u2014the ERISA plan\u2019s terms govern. Neither general un-\n just enrichment principles nor specific doctrines reflecting those prin-\n ciples\u2014such as the double-recovery or common-fund rules invoked by\n McCutchen\u2014can override the applicable contract. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Section 502(a)(3) authorizes the kinds of relief \u201ctypically\n available in equity\u201d before the merger of law and equity. Mertens v.\n Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 256. In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic\n Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356, the Court permitted a health-\n plan administrator to bring a suit just like this one. The administra-\n tor\u2019s claim to enforce its reimbursement clause, the Court explained,\n was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to enforce a\n contract-based lien\u2014called an \u201cequitable lien \u2018by agreement.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n 364\u2013365. Accordingly, the administrator could use \u00a7502(a)(3) to ob-\n tain funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over. The par-\n ties agree that US Airways can do the same here. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) Sereboff\u2019s logic dooms McCutchen\u2019s argument that two equi-\n table doctrines meant to prevent unjust enrichment\u2014the double-\n recovery rule and common-fund doctrine\u2014can override the terms of\n an ERISA plan in such a suit. As in Sereboff, US Airways is seeking\n to enforce the modern-day equivalent of an equitable lien by agree-\n ment. Such a lien both arises from and serves to carry out a con-\n tract\u2019s provisions. See 547 U. S., at 363\u2013364. Thus, enforcing the\n lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises and declin-\n ing to apply rules\u2014even if they would be \u201cequitable\u201d absent a con-\n tract\u2014at odds with the parties\u2019 expressed commitments. The Court\n has found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity\n courts. McCutchen identifies a slew of cases in which courts applied\n the equitable doctrines invoked here, but none in which they did so to\n override a clear contract that provided otherwise. This result com-\n ports with ERISA\u2019s focus on what a plan provides: \u00a7502(a)(3) does not\n \u201cauthorize \u2018appropriate equitable relief\u2019 at large,\u201d Mertens, 508 U. S.,\n at 253, but countenances only such relief as will enforce \u201cthe terms of\n the plan\u201d or the statute. Pp. 6\u201311.\n    2. While McCutchen\u2019s equitable rules cannot trump a reimburse-\n ment provision, they may aid in properly construing it. US Airways\u2019\n plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\u2019s fees, and the common-\n fund doctrine provides the appropriate default rule to fill that gap.\n Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (a) Ordinary contract interpretation principles support this con-\n clusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as they do other contracts, by\n \u201clooking to the terms of the plan\u201d as well as to \u201cother manifestations\n of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  U. S. 101, 113. Where the terms of a plan leave gaps, courts must\n  \u201clook outside the plan\u2019s written language\u201d to decide the agreement\u2019s\n  meaning, CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and they proper-\n  ly take account of the doctrines that typically or traditionally have\n  governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.\n  Pp. 12\u201313.\n       (b) US Airways\u2019 reimbursement provision precludes looking to\n  the double-recovery rule in this manner because it provides an alloca-\n  tion formula that expressly contradicts the equitable rule. By con-\n  trast, the plan says nothing specific about how to pay for the costs of\n  recovery. Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine pro-\n  vides the best indication of the parties\u2019 intent. This Court\u2019s cases\n  make clear that the doctrine would govern here in the absence of a\n  contrary agreement. See, e.g., Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S.\n  472, 478. Because a party would not typically expect or intend a plan\n  saying nothing about attorney\u2019s fees to abrogate so strong and uni-\n  form a background rule, a court should be loath to read the plan in\n  that way. The common-fund rule\u2019s rationale reinforces this conclu-\n  sion: Without the rule, the insurer can free ride on the beneficiary\u2019s\n  efforts, and the beneficiary, as in this case, may be made worse off for\n  having pursued a third party. A contract should not be read to pro-\n  duce these strange results unless it specifically provides as much.\n  Pp. 13\u201316.\n663 F. 3d 671, vacated and remanded.\n\n   KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\nGINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

JAMES E. MCCUTCHEN ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 16, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Respondent James McCutchen participated in a health\nbenefits plan that his employer, petitioner US Airways,\nestablished under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a71001 et seq.\nThat plan obliged US Airways to pay any medical ex-\npenses McCutchen incurred as a result of a third party\u2019s\nactions\u2014for example, another person\u2019s negligent driving. The\nplan in turn entitled US Airways to reimbursement if\nMcCutchen later recovered money from the third party.\n   This Court has held that a health-plan administrator\nlike US Airways may enforce such a reimbursement provi\u00ad\nsion by filing suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) of ERISA, 88 Stat. 891,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(3). See Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medi-\ncal Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006). That section au\u00ad\nthorizes a civil action \u201cto obtain . . . appropriate equitable\nrelief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.\u201d We here\nconsider whether in that kind of suit, a plan participant\nlike McCutchen may raise certain equitable defenses\n2             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nderiving from principles of unjust enrichment. In particu\u00ad\nlar, we address one equitable doctrine limiting reim\u00ad\nbursement to the amount of an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble recovery\u201d\nand another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to\npay a share of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in securing\nfunds from the third party. We hold that neither of those\nequitable rules can override the clear terms of a plan. But\nwe explain that the latter, usually called the common-fund\ndoctrine, plays a role in interpreting US Airways\u2019 plan\nbecause the plan is silent about allocating the costs of\nrecovery.\n                             I\n  In January 2007, McCutchen suffered serious injuries\nwhen another driver lost control of her car and collided\nwith McCutchen\u2019s. At the time, McCutchen was an em\u00ad\nployee of US Airways and a participant in its self-funded\nhealth plan. The plan paid $66,866 in medical expenses\narising from the accident on McCutchen\u2019s behalf.\n  McCutchen retained attorneys, in exchange for a 40%\ncontingency fee, to seek recovery of all his accident-related\ndamages, estimated to exceed $1 million. The attorneys\nsued the driver responsible for the crash, but settled for\nonly $10,000 because she had limited insurance coverage\nand the accident had killed or seriously injured three\nother people. Counsel also secured a payment from\nMcCutchen\u2019s own automobile insurer of $100,000, the\nmaximum amount available under his policy. McCutchen\nthus received $110,000\u2014and after deducting $44,000 for\nthe lawyer\u2019s fee, $66,000.\n  On learning of McCutchen\u2019s recovery, US Airways de\u00ad\nmanded reimbursement of the $66,866 it had paid in\nmedical expenses. In support of that claim, US Airways\nrelied on the following statement in its summary plan\ndescription:\n    \u201cIf [US Airways] pays benefits for any claim you incur\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n     as the result of negligence, willful misconduct, or other\n     actions of a third party, . . . [y]ou will be required to\n     reimburse [US Airways] for amounts paid for claims\n     out of any monies recovered from [the] third party,\n     including, but not limited to, your own insurance\n     company as the result of judgment, settlement, or\n     otherwise.\u201d App. 20.1\nMcCutchen denied that US Airways was entitled to any\nreimbursement, but his attorneys placed $41,500 in an\nescrow account pending resolution of the dispute. That\namount represented US Airways\u2019 full claim minus a pro\u00ad\nportionate share of the promised attorney\u2019s fees.\n   US Airways then filed this action under \u00a7502(a)(3),\nseeking \u201cappropriate equitable relief \u201d to enforce the plan\u2019s\nreimbursement provision. The suit requested an equitable\nlien on $66,866\u2014the $41,500 in the escrow account and\n$25,366 more in McCutchen\u2019s possession. McCutchen\ncountered by raising two defenses relevant here. First, he\nmaintained that US Airways could not receive the relief it\nsought because he had recovered only a small portion of\nhis total damages; absent over-recovery on his part, US\nAirways\u2019 right to reimbursement did not kick in. Second,\nhe contended that US Airways at least had to contribute\nits fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 We have made clear that the statements in a summary plan descrip\u00ad\n\ntion \u201ccommunicat[e] with beneficiaries about the plan, but . . . do\nnot themselves constitute the terms of the plan.\u201d CIGNA Corp. v.\nAmara, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). Nonetheless, the\nparties litigated this case, and both lower courts decided it, based solely\non the language quoted above. See 663 F. 3d 671, 673 (CA3 2011); App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 26a. Only in this Court, in response to a request from\nthe Solicitor General, did the plan itself come to light. See Letter from\nMatthew W. H. Wessler to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (Nov. 19,\n2012) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). That is too late to affect\nwhat happens here: Because everyone in this case has treated the\nlanguage from the summary description as though it came from the\nplan, we do so as well.\n4               US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nany reimbursement therefore had to be marked down by\n40%, to cover the promised contingency fee. The District\nCourt rejected both arguments, granting summary judg\u00ad\nment to US Airways on the ground that the plan \u201cclear[ly]\nand unambiguous[ly]\u201d provided for full reimbursement of\nthe medical expenses paid. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; see\nid., at 32a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order. The Third Circuit reasoned that in\na suit for \u201cappropriate equitable relief \u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3), a\ncourt must apply any \u201cequitable doctrines and defenses\u201d\nthat traditionally limited the relief requested. 663 F. 3d\n671, 676 (CA3 2011). And here, the court continued, \u201c \u2018the\nprinciple of unjust enrichment\u2019 \u201d should \u201c \u2018serve to limit the\neffectiveness\u2019 \u201d of the plan\u2019s reimbursement provision. See\nid., at 677 (quoting 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution\n\u00a723.18, p. 472\u2013473 (1978)). Full reimbursement, the Third\nCircuit thought, would \u201cleav[e] [McCutchen] with less\nthan full payment\u201d for his medical bills; at the same time,\nit would provide a \u201cwindfall\u201d to US Airways given its\nfailure to \u201ccontribute to the cost of obtaining the third\u00ad\nparty recovery.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 679. The Third Circuit then\ninstructed the District Court to determine what amount,\nshy of the entire $66,866, would qualify as \u201cappropriate\nequitable relief.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\ncircuit split on whether equitable defenses can so override\nan ERISA plan\u2019s reimbursement provision.2 We now\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Compare 663 F. 3d 671, 673 (CA3 2011) (case below) (holding that\nequitable doctrines can trump a plan\u2019s terms); CGI Technologies &\nSolutions Inc. v.

Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248, 256 (1993) (emphasis deleted).\n   In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, we allowed\na health-plan administrator to bring a suit just like this\none under \u00a7502(a)(3). Mid Atlantic had paid medical\nexpenses for the Sereboffs after they were injured in a car\ncrash. When they settled a tort suit against the other\ndriver, Mid Atlantic claimed a share of the proceeds,\ninvoking the plan\u2019s reimbursement clause. We held\nthat Mid Atlantic\u2019s action sought \u201cequitable relief,\u201d as\n\u00a7502(a)(3) requires. See 547 U. S., at 369. The \u201cnature of\nthe recovery\u201d requested was equitable because Mid Atlan\u00ad\ntic claimed \u201cspecifically identifiable funds\u201d within the\nSereboffs\u2019 control\u2014that is, a portion of the settlement they\nhad gotten. Id., at 362\u2013363 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And the \u201cbasis for [the] claim\u201d was equitable too,\nbecause Mid Atlantic relied on \u201c \u2018the familiar rul[e] of\nequity that a contract to convey a specific object\u2019 \u201d not yet\nacquired \u201c \u2018create[s] a lien\u2019 \u201d on that object as soon as \u201c \u2018the\ncontractor . . . gets a title to the thing.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 363\u2013364\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n& Wansbrough, 354 F. 3d 348, 362 (CA5 2003) (same); Administrative\nComm. of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

S. C. \u00a71132(a)(3).\n6             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U. S. 117, 121 (1914)).\nMid Atlantic\u2019s claim for reimbursement, we determined,\nwas the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to\nenforce such a contract-based lien\u2014called an \u201cequitable\nlien by agreement.\u201d 547 U. S., at 364\u2013365 (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted). Accordingly, Mid Atlantic could\nbring an action under \u00a7502(a)(3) seeking the funds that its\nbeneficiaries had promised to turn over. And here, as all\nparties agree, US Airways can do the same thing.\n   The question in this case concerns the role that equita\u00ad\nble defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a\nsuit. As earlier noted, the Third Circuit held that \u201cthe\nprinciple of unjust enrichment\u201d overrides US Airways\u2019\nreimbursement clause if and when they come into conflict.\n663 F. 3d, at 677. McCutchen offers a more refined ver\u00ad\nsion of that view, alleging that two specific equitable\ndoctrines meant to \u201cprevent unjust enrichment\u201d defeat the\nreimbursement provision. Brief for Respondents i. First,\nhe contends that in equity, an insurer in US Airways\u2019\nposition could recoup no more than an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble\nrecovery\u201d\u2014the amount the insured has received from a\nthird party to compensate for the same loss the insurance\ncovered. That rule would limit US Airways\u2019 reimburse\u00ad\nment to the share of McCutchen\u2019s settlements paying for\nmedical expenses; McCutchen would keep the rest (e.g.,\ndamages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering),\neven though the plan gives US Airways first claim on the\nwhole third-party recovery. Second, McCutchen claims\nthat in equity the common-fund doctrine would have\noperated to reduce any award to US Airways. Under that\nrule, \u201ca litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund\nfor the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is\nentitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as a\nwhole.\u201d Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S. 472, 478\n(1980). McCutchen urges that this doctrine, which is\ndesigned to prevent freeloading, enables him to pass on a\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

The Sere\u00ad\nboffs argued, among other things, that the lower courts\nerred in enforcing Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement clause\n\u201cwithout imposing various limitations\u201d that would \u201capply\nto truly equitable relief grounded in principles of subroga\u00ad\ntion.\u201d5 547 U. S., at 368 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). In particular, the Sereboffs contended that a variant\nof the double-recovery rule, called the make-whole doc\u00ad\ntrine, trumped the plan\u2019s terms. We rebuffed that argu\u00ad\nment, explaining that the Sereboffs were improperly\nmixing and matching rules from different equitable boxes.\nThe Sereboffs asserted a \u201cparcel of equitable defenses\u201d\navailable when an out-of-pocket insurer brought a \u201cfree\u00ad\nstanding action for equitable subrogation,\u201d not founded on\na contract, to succeed to an insured\u2019s judgment against a\nthird party. Ibid. But Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Both our prior cases and secondary sources confirm McCutchen\u2019s\n\ncharacterization of the common-fund and double-recovery rules as\nderiving primarily from principles of unjust enrichment. See Boeing,\n444 U. S., at 478 (\u201cThe [common-fund] doctrine rests on the perception\nthat persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to\nits cost are unjustly enriched\u201d); Mills v.

MCCUTCHEN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim was \u201cconsidered equitable,\u201d we replied, because it\nsought to enforce a \u201c lien based on agreement \u201d\u2014not a lien\nimposed independent of contract by virtue of equitable\nsubrogation.6 Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nlight of that fact, we viewed the Sereboffs\u2019 equitable de\u00ad\nfenses\u2014which again, closely resemble McCutchen\u2019s\u2014as\n\u201cbeside the point.\u201d Ibid. And yet, we left a narrow open\u00ad\ning for future litigants in the Sereboffs\u2019 position to make a\nlike claim. In a footnote, we observed that the Sereboffs\nhad forfeited a \u201cdistinct assertion\u201d that the contract-based\nrelief Mid Atlantic requested, although \u201cequitable,\u201d was\nnot \u201cappropriate\u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3) because \u201cit contravened\nprinciples like the make-whole doctrine.\u201d Id., at 368\u2013369\nn. 2. Enter McCutchen, to make that basic argument.\n   In the end, however, Sereboff \u2019s logic dooms McCutchen\u2019s\neffort. US Airways, like Mid Atlantic, is seeking to enforce\nthe modern-day equivalent of an \u201cequitable lien by agree\u00ad\nment.\u201d And that kind of lien\u2014as its name announces\u2014\nboth arises from and serves to carry out a contract\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsions. See id., at 363\u2013364; 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\u2019s Equity\nJurisprudence \u00a71234, p. 695 (5th ed. 1941). So enforcing\nthe lien means holding the parties to their mutual promis\u00ad\nes. See, e.g., Barnes, 232 U. S., at 121; Walker v. Brown,\n165 U. S. 654, 664 (1897). Conversely, it means declining\nto apply rules\u2014even if they would be \u201cequitable\u201d in a\ncontract\u2019s absence\u2014at odds with the parties\u2019 expressed\ncommitments. McCutchen therefore cannot rely on theo\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Sereboff Court\u2019s analysis concerned only subrogation actions\n\nbased on equitable principles independent of any agreement. A subro\u00ad\ngation action may also be founded on a contract incorporating those\nprinciples. See 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(4), at 604. US Airways suggested at oral\nargument that McCutchen\u2019s case would \u201cge[t] a lot stronger\u201d if the plan\nhere spoke only of subrogation, without separately granting a right of\nreimbursement. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. We need not consider that ques\u00ad\ntion because US Airways seeks to enforce a reimbursement provision, of\nthe same kind we considered in Sereboff.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Those principles, as we said in\nSereboff, are \u201cbeside the point\u201d when parties demand what\nthey bargained for in a valid agreement. See Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a72(2), p. 15\n(2010) (\u201cA valid contract defines the obligations of the\nparties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that\nextent any inquiry into unjust enrichment\u201d). In those\ncircumstances, hewing to the parties\u2019 exchange yields\n\u201cappropriate\u201d as well as \u201cequitable\u201d relief.\n   We have found nothing to the contrary in the historic\npractice of equity courts. McCutchen offers us a slew of\ncases in which those courts applied the double-recovery or\ncommon-fund rule to limit insurers\u2019 efforts to recoup funds\nfrom their beneficiaries\u2019 tort judgments. See Brief for\nRespondents 21\u201325. But his citations are not on point. In\nsome of McCutchen\u2019s cases, courts apparently applied\nequitable doctrines in the absence of any relevant contract\nprovision. See, e.g., Washtenaw Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.\nBudd, 208 Mich. 483, 486\u2013487, 175 N. W. 231, 232 (1919);\nFire Assn. of Philadelphia v. Wells, 84 N. J. Eq. 484, 487,\n94 A. 619, 621 (1915). In others, courts found those rules\nto comport with the applicable contract term. For exam\u00ad\nple, in Svea Assurance Co. v. Packham, 92 Md. 464, 48 A.\n359 (1901)\u2014the case McCutchen calls his best, see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 47\u201348\u2014the court viewed the double-recovery\nrule as according with \u201cthe intention\u201d of the contracting\nparties; \u201c[b]road as [the] language is,\u201d the court explained,\nthe agreement \u201ccannot be construed to\u201d give the insurer\nany greater recovery. 92 Md., at 478, 48 A., at 362; see\nalso Knaffl v. Knoxville Banking & Trust Co., 133 Tenn.\n655, 661, 182 S. W. 232, 233 (1916); Camden Fire Ins.\nAssn. v. Prezioso, 93 N. J. Eq. 318, 319\u2013320, 116 A. 694,\n694 (Ch. Div. 1922). But in none of these cases\u2014nor in\nany other we can find\u2014did an equity court apply the\ndouble-recovery or common-fund rule to override a plain\n10             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncontract term. That is, in none did an equity court do\nwhat McCutchen asks of us.\n   Nevertheless, the United States, appearing as amicus\ncuriae, claims that the common-fund rule has a special\ncapacity to trump a conflicting contract. The Government\nbegins its brief foursquare with our (and Sereboff \u2019s) analy\u00ad\nsis: In a suit like this one, to enforce an equitable lien by\nagreement, \u201cthe agreement, not general restitutionary\nprinciples of unjust enrichment, provides the measure of\nrelief due.\u201d Brief for United States 6. Because that is so,\nthe Government (naturally enough) concludes, McCutchen\ncannot invoke the double-recovery rule to defeat the plan.\nBut then the Government takes an unexpected turn.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the costs incurred\u201d by a beneficiary to\nobtain money from a third party, \u201cthe terms of the plan do\nnot control.\u201d Id., at 21. An equity court, the Government\ncontends, has \u201cinherent authority\u201d to apportion litigation\ncosts in accord with the \u201clongstanding equitable common\u00ad\nfund doctrine,\u201d even if that conflicts with the parties\u2019\ncontract. Id., at 22.\n   But if the agreement governs, the agreement governs:\nThe reasons we have given (and the Government mostly ac\u00ad\ncepts) for looking to the contract\u2019s terms do not permit an\nattorney\u2019s-fees exception. We have no doubt that the common\u00ad\nfund doctrine has deep roots in equity. See Sprague\nv. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U. S. 161, 164 (1939) (tracing\nequity courts\u2019 authority over fees to the First Judiciary\nAct). Those roots, however, are set in the soil of unjust\nenrichment: To allow \u201cothers to obtain full benefit from\nthe plaintiff \u2019s efforts without contributing . . . to the litiga\u00ad\ntion expenses,\u201d we have often noted, \u201cwould be to enrich\nthe others unjustly at the plaintiff \u2019s expense.\u201d Mills v.\nElectric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U. S. 375, 392 (1970); see Boe-\ning, 444 U. S., at 478; Trustees v. Greenough, 105 U. S.\n527, 532 (1882); supra, at 6\u20137 and n. 4.

S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen a court enforces an equitable lien by agreement. See\nsupra, at 8\u20139. The agreement itself becomes the measure\nof the parties\u2019 equities; so if a contract abrogates the com\u00ad\nmon-fund doctrine, the insurer is not unjustly enriched by\nclaiming the benefit of its bargain. That is why the Gov\u00ad\nernment, like McCutchen, fails to produce a single case in\nwhich an equity court applied the common-fund rule (any\nmore than the double-recovery rule) when a contract\nprovided to the contrary. Even in equity, when a party\nsought to enforce a lien by agreement, all provisions of\nthat agreement controlled. So too, then, in a suit like this\none.\n   The result we reach, based on the historical analysis our\nprior cases prescribe, fits lock and key with ERISA\u2019s focus\non what a plan provides. The section under which this\nsuit is brought \u201cdoes not, after all, authorize \u2018appropriate\nequitable relief \u2019 at large,\u201d Mertens, 508 U. S., at 253 (quot\u00ad\ning \u00a71132(a)(3)); rather, it countenances only such relief\nas will enforce \u201cthe terms of the plan\u201d or the statute,\n\u00a71132(a)(3) (emphasis added). That limitation reflects\nERISA\u2019s principal function: to \u201cprotect contractually de\u00ad\nfined benefits.\u201d Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Rus-\nsell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985). The statutory scheme, we\nhave often noted, \u201cis built around reliance on the face\nof written plan documents.\u201d Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.\nSchoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 83 (1995). \u201cEvery employee\nbenefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant\nto a written instrument,\u201d \u00a71102(a)(1), and an administra\u00ad\ntor must act \u201cin accordance with the documents and in\u00ad\nstruments governing the plan\u201d insofar as they accord with\nthe statute, \u00a71104(a)(1)(D). The plan, in short, is at the\ncenter of ERISA. And precluding McCutchen\u2019s equitable\ndefenses from overriding plain contract terms helps it to\nremain there.\n12               US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n\n                          Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                            III\n\n   Yet McCutchen\u2019s arguments are not all for naught. If\nthe equitable rules he describes cannot trump a reim\u00ad\nbursement provision, they still might aid in properly\nconstruing it. And for US Airways\u2019 plan, the common-fund\ndoctrine (though not the double-recovery rule) serves that\nfunction. The plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\u2019s\nfees, and in those circumstances, the common-fund doc\u00ad\ntrine provides the appropriate default. In other words, if\nUS Airways wished to depart from the well-established\ncommon-fund rule, it had to draft its contract to say so\u2014\nand here it did not.7\n   Ordinary principles of contract interpretation point\ntoward this conclusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as\nthey do other contracts, by \u201clooking to the terms of the\nplan\u201d as well as to \u201cother manifestations of the parties\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The dissent faults us for addressing this issue, but we think it ade\u00ad\n\nquately preserved and presented. The language the dissent highlights\nin McCutchen\u2019s brief in opposition, indicating that the plan clearly\nabrogates the common-fund doctrine, comes from his description of US\nAirways\u2019 claim in the District Court. See post, at 1 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.); Brief in Opposition 5. McCutchen\u2019s argument in that court urged\nthe very position we adopt\u2014that the common-fund doctrine applies\nbecause the plan is silent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; Defendants\u2019\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judg\u00ad\nment in No. 2:08\u2013cv\u20131593 (WD Pa., Dec. 4, 2011), Doc. 33, pp. 12\u201313\n(\u201cIf [US Airways] wanted to exclude a deduction for attorney fees, it\neasily could have so expressed\u201d). To be sure, McCutchen shifted ground\non appeal because the District Court ruled that Third Circuit precedent\nforeclosed his contract-based argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a;\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision then put front-and-center his alternative\ncontention that the common-fund rule trumps a contract. But both\nclaims have the same basis (the nature and function of the common\u00ad\nfund doctrine), which the parties have disputed throughout this litiga\u00ad\ntion. And similarly, the question we decide here is included in the\nquestion presented. The principal clause of that question asks whether\na court may use \u201cequitable principles to rewrite contractual language.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i.

The words of a plan may speak clearly,\nbut they may also leave gaps. And so a court must often\n\u201clook outside the plan\u2019s written language\u201d to decide what\nan agreement means. CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (slip op., at 13); see Curtiss-Wright, 514 U. S., at\n80\u201381. In undertaking that task, a court properly takes\naccount of background legal rules\u2014the doctrines that\ntypically or traditionally have governed a given situation\nwhen no agreement states otherwise. See Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. Assoc. Health & Welfare Plan v. Wells, 213\nF. 3d 398, 402 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.) (\u201c[C]ontracts . . . are\nenacted against a background of common-sense under\u00ad\nstandings and legal principles that the parties may not\nhave bothered to incorporate expressly but that operate as\ndefault rules to govern in the absence of a clear expression\nof the parties\u2019 [contrary] intent\u201d); 11 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts \u00a731:7 (4th ed. 2012); Restatement (Second) of\nContracts \u00a7221 (1979). Indeed, ignoring those rules is\nlikely to frustrate the parties\u2019 intent and produce perverse\nconsequences.\n   The reimbursement provision at issue here precludes\nlooking to the double-recovery rule in this manner. Both\nthe contract term and the equitable principle address the\nsame problem: how to apportion, as between an insurer\nand a beneficiary, a third party\u2019s payment to recompense\nan injury. But the allocation formulas they prescribe\ndiffer markedly. According to the plan, US Airways has\nfirst claim on the entire recovery\u2014as the plan description\nstates, on \u201cany monies recovered from [the] third party\u201d;\nMcCutchen receives only whatever is left over (if any\u00ad\nthing). See supra, at 3. By contrast, the double-recovery\nrule would give McCutchen first dibs on the portion of the\nrecovery compensating for losses that the plan did not\ncover (e.g., future earnings or pain and suffering); US\nAirways\u2019 claim would attach only to the share of the recov\u00ad\n14            US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nery for medical expenses. See supra, at 6\u20137. The express\ncontract term, in short, contradicts the background equi\u00ad\ntable rule; and where that is so, for all the reasons we\nhave given, the agreement must govern.\n   By contrast, the plan provision here leaves space for the\ncommon-fund rule to operate. That equitable doctrine, as\nearlier noted, addresses not how to allocate a third-party\nrecovery, but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining\nit. See supra, at 7. And the contract, for its part, says\nnothing specific about that issue. The District Court\nbelow thus erred when it found that the plan clearly repu\u00ad\ndiated the common-fund rule. See supra, at 4. To be sure,\nthe plan\u2019s allocation formula\u2014first claim on the recovery\ngoes to US Airways\u2014might operate on every dollar re\u00ad\nceived from a third party, even those covering the benefi\u00ad\nciary\u2019s litigation costs. But alternatively, that formula\ncould apply to only the true recovery, after the costs of\nobtaining it are deducted. (Consider, for comparative\npurposes, how an income tax is levied on net, not gross,\nreceipts.) See Dawson, Lawyers and Involuntary Clients:\nAttorney Fees From Funds, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1597, 1606\u2013\n1607 (1974) (\u201c[T]he claim for legal services is a first charge\non the fund and must be satisfied before any distribution\noccurs\u201d). The plan\u2019s terms fail to select between these two\nalternatives: whether the recovery to which US Airways\nhas first claim is every cent the third party paid or, in\u00ad\nstead, the money the beneficiary took away.\n   Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine\nprovides the best indication of the parties\u2019 intent. No one\ncan doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here\nin the absence of a contrary agreement. This Court has\n\u201crecognized consistently\u201d that someone \u201cwho recovers a\ncommon fund for the benefit of persons other than him\u00ad\nself\u201d is due \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as\nwhole.\u201d Boeing Co., 444 U.

And that means a court should be loath to\nread such a plan in that way.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 For that reason, almost every state court that has confronted the\nissue has done what we do here: apply the common-fund doctrine in\nthe face of a contract giving an insurer a general right to recoup funds\nfrom an insured\u2019s third-party recovery, without specifically addressing\nattorney\u2019s fees.

MCCUTCHEN\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n  The rationale for the common-fund rule reinforces that\nconclusion. Third-party recoveries do not often come free:\nTo get one, an insured must incur lawyer\u2019s fees and ex\u00ad\npenses. Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its\nbeneficiary\u2019s efforts\u2014taking the fruits while contributing\nnothing to the labor. Odder still, in some cases\u2014indeed,\nin this case\u2014the beneficiary is made worse off by pursuing\na third party. Recall that McCutchen spent $44,000 (rep\u00ad\nresenting a 40% contingency fee) to get $110,000, leaving\nhim with a real recovery of $66,000. But US Airways\nclaimed $66,866 in medical expenses. That would put\nMcCutchen $866 in the hole; in effect, he would pay for the\nprivilege of serving as US Airways\u2019 collection agent. We\nthink McCutchen would not have foreseen that result\nwhen he signed on to the plan. And we doubt if even US\nAirways should want it. When the next McCutchen comes\nalong, he is not likely to relieve US Airways of the costs of\nrecovery. See Blackburn v. Sundstrand Corp., 115 F. 3d\n493, 496 (CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (\u201c[I]f . . . injured\npersons could not charge legal costs against recoveries,\npeople like [McCutchen] would in the future have every\nreason\u201d to make different judgments about bringing suit,\n\u201cthrowing on plans the burden and expense of collection\u201d).\nThe prospect of generating those strange results again\nmilitates against reading a general reimbursement provi\u00ad\nsion\u2014like the one here\u2014for more than it is worth. Only if\nUS Airways\u2019 plan expressly addressed the costs of recovery\nwould it alter the common-fund doctrine.\n                           IV\n  Our holding today has two parts, one favoring US Air\u00ad\nways, the other McCutchen. First, in an action brought\nunder \u00a7502(a)(3) based on an equitable lien by agreement,\nthe terms of the ERISA plan govern.

But\nsecond, the common-fund rule informs interpretation of\nUS Airways\u2019 reimbursement provision. Because that term\ndoes not advert to the costs of recovery, it is properly read\nto retain the common-fund doctrine. We therefore also\ndisagree with the District Court\u2019s decision.

MCCUTCHEN ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 11\u20131285. Argued November 27, 2012\u2014Decided April 16, 2013\nThe health benefits plan established by petitioner US Airways paid\n  $66,866 in medical expenses for injuries suffered by respondent\n  McCutchen, a US Airways employee, in a car accident caused by a\n  third party. The plan entitled US Airways to reimbursement if\n  McCutchen later recovered money from the third party. McCutchen\u2019s\n  attorneys secured $110,000 in payments, and McCutchen received\n  $66,000 after deducting the lawyers\u2019 40% contingency fee. US Air-\n  ways demanded reimbursement of the full $66,866 it had paid. When\n  McCutchen did not comply, US Airways filed suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) of\n  the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n  which authorizes health-plan administrators to bring a civil action\n  \u201cto obtain . . . appropriate equitable relief . . . to enforce . . . the terms\n  of the plan.\u201d McCutchen raised two defenses to US Airways\u2019 request\n  for an equitable lien on the $66,866 it demanded: that, absent over-\n  recovery on his part, US Airways\u2019 right to reimbursement did not\n  kick in; and that US Airways had to contribute its fair share to the\n  costs he incurred to get his recovery, so any reimbursement had to be\n  reduced by 40%, to cover the contingency fee. Rejecting both argu-\n  ments, the District Court granted summary judgment to US Airways.\n  The Third Circuit vacated. Reasoning that traditional \u201cequitable\n  doctrines and defenses\u201d applied to \u00a7502(a)(3) suits, it held that the\n  principle of unjust enrichment overrode US Airways\u2019 reimbursement\n  clause because the clause would leave McCutchen with less than full\n  payment for his medical bills and would give US Airways a windfall.\n2                US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nHeld:\n    1. In a \u00a7502(a)(3) action based on an equitable lien by agreement\u2014\n like this one\u2014the ERISA plan\u2019s terms govern. Neither general un-\n just enrichment principles nor specific doctrines reflecting those prin-\n ciples\u2014such as the double-recovery or common-fund rules invoked by\n McCutchen\u2014can override the applicable contract. Pp. 5\u201311.\n       (a) Section 502(a)(3) authorizes the kinds of relief \u201ctypically\n available in equity\u201d before the merger of law and equity. Mertens v.\n Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248, 256. In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic\n Medical Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356, the Court permitted a health-\n plan administrator to bring a suit just like this one. The administra-\n tor\u2019s claim to enforce its reimbursement clause, the Court explained,\n was the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to enforce a\n contract-based lien\u2014called an \u201cequitable lien \u2018by agreement.\u2019 \u201d Id., at\n 364\u2013365. Accordingly, the administrator could use \u00a7502(a)(3) to ob-\n tain funds that its beneficiaries had promised to turn over. The par-\n ties agree that US Airways can do the same here. Pp. 5\u20136.\n       (b) Sereboff\u2019s logic dooms McCutchen\u2019s argument that two equi-\n table doctrines meant to prevent unjust enrichment\u2014the double-\n recovery rule and common-fund doctrine\u2014can override the terms of\n an ERISA plan in such a suit. As in Sereboff, US Airways is seeking\n to enforce the modern-day equivalent of an equitable lien by agree-\n ment. Such a lien both arises from and serves to carry out a con-\n tract\u2019s provisions. See 547 U. S., at 363\u2013364. Thus, enforcing the\n lien means holding the parties to their mutual promises and declin-\n ing to apply rules\u2014even if they would be \u201cequitable\u201d absent a con-\n tract\u2014at odds with the parties\u2019 expressed commitments. The Court\n has found nothing to the contrary in the historic practice of equity\n courts. McCutchen identifies a slew of cases in which courts applied\n the equitable doctrines invoked here, but none in which they did so to\n override a clear contract that provided otherwise. This result com-\n ports with ERISA\u2019s focus on what a plan provides: \u00a7502(a)(3) does not\n \u201cauthorize \u2018appropriate equitable relief\u2019 at large,\u201d Mertens, 508 U. S.,\n at 253, but countenances only such relief as will enforce \u201cthe terms of\n the plan\u201d or the statute. Pp. 6\u201311.\n    2. While McCutchen\u2019s equitable rules cannot trump a reimburse-\n ment provision, they may aid in properly construing it. US Airways\u2019\n plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\u2019s fees, and the common-\n fund doctrine provides the appropriate default rule to fill that gap.\n Pp. 12\u201316.\n       (a) Ordinary contract interpretation principles support this con-\n clusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as they do other contracts, by\n \u201clooking to the terms of the plan\u201d as well as to \u201cother manifestations\n of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  U. S. 101, 113. Where the terms of a plan leave gaps, courts must\n  \u201clook outside the plan\u2019s written language\u201d to decide the agreement\u2019s\n  meaning, CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and they proper-\n  ly take account of the doctrines that typically or traditionally have\n  governed a given situation when no agreement states otherwise.\n  Pp. 12\u201313.\n       (b) US Airways\u2019 reimbursement provision precludes looking to\n  the double-recovery rule in this manner because it provides an alloca-\n  tion formula that expressly contradicts the equitable rule. By con-\n  trast, the plan says nothing specific about how to pay for the costs of\n  recovery. Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine pro-\n  vides the best indication of the parties\u2019 intent. This Court\u2019s cases\n  make clear that the doctrine would govern here in the absence of a\n  contrary agreement. See, e.g., Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S.\n  472, 478. Because a party would not typically expect or intend a plan\n  saying nothing about attorney\u2019s fees to abrogate so strong and uni-\n  form a background rule, a court should be loath to read the plan in\n  that way. The common-fund rule\u2019s rationale reinforces this conclu-\n  sion: Without the rule, the insurer can free ride on the beneficiary\u2019s\n  efforts, and the beneficiary, as in this case, may be made worse off for\n  having pursued a third party. A contract should not be read to pro-\n  duce these strange results unless it specifically provides as much.\n  Pp. 13\u201316.\n663 F. 3d 671, vacated and remanded.\n\n   KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which KENNEDY,\nGINSBURG, BREYER, and SOTOMAYOR, JJ., joined.

S. C. \u00a71001 et seq.\nThat plan obliged US Airways to pay any medical ex-\npenses McCutchen incurred as a result of a third party\u2019s\nactions\u2014for example, another person\u2019s negligent driving. The\nplan in turn entitled US Airways to reimbursement if\nMcCutchen later recovered money from the third party.\n   This Court has held that a health-plan administrator\nlike US Airways may enforce such a reimbursement provi\u00ad\nsion by filing suit under \u00a7502(a)(3) of ERISA, 88 Stat. 891,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a71132(a)(3). See Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medi-\ncal Services, Inc., 547 U. S. 356 (2006). That section au\u00ad\nthorizes a civil action \u201cto obtain . . . appropriate equitable\nrelief . . . to enforce . . . the terms of the plan.\u201d We here\nconsider whether in that kind of suit, a plan participant\nlike McCutchen may raise certain equitable defenses\n2             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nderiving from principles of unjust enrichment. In particu\u00ad\nlar, we address one equitable doctrine limiting reim\u00ad\nbursement to the amount of an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble recovery\u201d\nand another requiring the party seeking reimbursement to\npay a share of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in securing\nfunds from the third party. We hold that neither of those\nequitable rules can override the clear terms of a plan. But\nwe explain that the latter, usually called the common-fund\ndoctrine, plays a role in interpreting US Airways\u2019 plan\nbecause the plan is silent about allocating the costs of\nrecovery.\n                             I\n  In January 2007, McCutchen suffered serious injuries\nwhen another driver lost control of her car and collided\nwith McCutchen\u2019s. At the time, McCutchen was an em\u00ad\nployee of US Airways and a participant in its self-funded\nhealth plan. The plan paid $66,866 in medical expenses\narising from the accident on McCutchen\u2019s behalf.\n  McCutchen retained attorneys, in exchange for a 40%\ncontingency fee, to seek recovery of all his accident-related\ndamages, estimated to exceed $1 million. The attorneys\nsued the driver responsible for the crash, but settled for\nonly $10,000 because she had limited insurance coverage\nand the accident had killed or seriously injured three\nother people. Counsel also secured a payment from\nMcCutchen\u2019s own automobile insurer of $100,000, the\nmaximum amount available under his policy. McCutchen\nthus received $110,000\u2014and after deducting $44,000 for\nthe lawyer\u2019s fee, $66,000.\n  On learning of McCutchen\u2019s recovery, US Airways de\u00ad\nmanded reimbursement of the $66,866 it had paid in\nmedical expenses. In support of that claim, US Airways\nrelied on the following statement in its summary plan\ndescription:\n    \u201cIf [US Airways] pays benefits for any claim you incur\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

[y]ou will be required to\n     reimburse [US Airways] for amounts paid for claims\n     out of any monies recovered from [the] third party,\n     including, but not limited to, your own insurance\n     company as the result of judgment, settlement, or\n     otherwise.\u201d App. 20.1\nMcCutchen denied that US Airways was entitled to any\nreimbursement, but his attorneys placed $41,500 in an\nescrow account pending resolution of the dispute. That\namount represented US Airways\u2019 full claim minus a pro\u00ad\nportionate share of the promised attorney\u2019s fees.\n   US Airways then filed this action under \u00a7502(a)(3),\nseeking \u201cappropriate equitable relief \u201d to enforce the plan\u2019s\nreimbursement provision. The suit requested an equitable\nlien on $66,866\u2014the $41,500 in the escrow account and\n$25,366 more in McCutchen\u2019s possession. McCutchen\ncountered by raising two defenses relevant here. First, he\nmaintained that US Airways could not receive the relief it\nsought because he had recovered only a small portion of\nhis total damages; absent over-recovery on his part, US\nAirways\u2019 right to reimbursement did not kick in. Second,\nhe contended that US Airways at least had to contribute\nits fair share to the costs he incurred to get his recovery;\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 We have made clear that the statements in a summary plan descrip\u00ad\n\ntion \u201ccommunicat[e] with beneficiaries about the plan, but . . . do\nnot themselves constitute the terms of the plan.\u201d CIGNA Corp. v.\nAmara, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 15). Nonetheless, the\nparties litigated this case, and both lower courts decided it, based solely\non the language quoted above. See 663 F. 3d 671, 673 (CA3 2011); App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 26a. Only in this Court, in response to a request from\nthe Solicitor General, did the plan itself come to light. See Letter from\nMatthew W. H. Wessler to William K. Suter, Clerk of Court (Nov. 19,\n2012) (available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). That is too late to affect\nwhat happens here: Because everyone in this case has treated the\nlanguage from the summary description as though it came from the\nplan, we do so as well.\n4               US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nany reimbursement therefore had to be marked down by\n40%, to cover the promised contingency fee. The District\nCourt rejected both arguments, granting summary judg\u00ad\nment to US Airways on the ground that the plan \u201cclear[ly]\nand unambiguous[ly]\u201d provided for full reimbursement of\nthe medical expenses paid. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; see\nid., at 32a.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the\nDistrict Court\u2019s order. The Third Circuit reasoned that in\na suit for \u201cappropriate equitable relief \u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3), a\ncourt must apply any \u201cequitable doctrines and defenses\u201d\nthat traditionally limited the relief requested. 663 F. 3d\n671, 676 (CA3 2011). And here, the court continued, \u201c \u2018the\nprinciple of unjust enrichment\u2019 \u201d should \u201c \u2018serve to limit the\neffectiveness\u2019 \u201d of the plan\u2019s reimbursement provision. See\nid., at 677 (quoting 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitution\n\u00a723.18, p. 472\u2013473 (1978)). Full reimbursement, the Third\nCircuit thought, would \u201cleav[e] [McCutchen] with less\nthan full payment\u201d for his medical bills; at the same time,\nit would provide a \u201cwindfall\u201d to US Airways given its\nfailure to \u201ccontribute to the cost of obtaining the third\u00ad\nparty recovery.\u201d 663 F. 3d, at 679. The Third Circuit then\ninstructed the District Court to determine what amount,\nshy of the entire $66,866, would qualify as \u201cappropriate\nequitable relief.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari, 567 U.

Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508\nU. S. 248, 256 (1993) (emphasis deleted).\n   In Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, we allowed\na health-plan administrator to bring a suit just like this\none under \u00a7502(a)(3). Mid Atlantic had paid medical\nexpenses for the Sereboffs after they were injured in a car\ncrash. When they settled a tort suit against the other\ndriver, Mid Atlantic claimed a share of the proceeds,\ninvoking the plan\u2019s reimbursement clause. We held\nthat Mid Atlantic\u2019s action sought \u201cequitable relief,\u201d as\n\u00a7502(a)(3) requires. See 547 U. S., at 369. The \u201cnature of\nthe recovery\u201d requested was equitable because Mid Atlan\u00ad\ntic claimed \u201cspecifically identifiable funds\u201d within the\nSereboffs\u2019 control\u2014that is, a portion of the settlement they\nhad gotten. Id., at 362\u2013363 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). And the \u201cbasis for [the] claim\u201d was equitable too,\nbecause Mid Atlantic relied on \u201c \u2018the familiar rul[e] of\nequity that a contract to convey a specific object\u2019 \u201d not yet\nacquired \u201c \u2018create[s] a lien\u2019 \u201d on that object as soon as \u201c \u2018the\ncontractor . . . gets a title to the thing.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 363\u2013364\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n& Wansbrough, 354 F. 3d 348, 362 (CA5 2003) (same); Administrative\nComm. of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

S. C. \u00a71132(a)(3).\n6             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(quoting Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U. S. 117, 121 (1914)).\nMid Atlantic\u2019s claim for reimbursement, we determined,\nwas the modern-day equivalent of an action in equity to\nenforce such a contract-based lien\u2014called an \u201cequitable\nlien by agreement.\u201d 547 U. S., at 364\u2013365 (internal quota\u00ad\ntion marks omitted). Accordingly, Mid Atlantic could\nbring an action under \u00a7502(a)(3) seeking the funds that its\nbeneficiaries had promised to turn over. And here, as all\nparties agree, US Airways can do the same thing.\n   The question in this case concerns the role that equita\u00ad\nble defenses alleging unjust enrichment can play in such a\nsuit. As earlier noted, the Third Circuit held that \u201cthe\nprinciple of unjust enrichment\u201d overrides US Airways\u2019\nreimbursement clause if and when they come into conflict.\n663 F. 3d, at 677. McCutchen offers a more refined ver\u00ad\nsion of that view, alleging that two specific equitable\ndoctrines meant to \u201cprevent unjust enrichment\u201d defeat the\nreimbursement provision. Brief for Respondents i. First,\nhe contends that in equity, an insurer in US Airways\u2019\nposition could recoup no more than an insured\u2019s \u201cdouble\nrecovery\u201d\u2014the amount the insured has received from a\nthird party to compensate for the same loss the insurance\ncovered. That rule would limit US Airways\u2019 reimburse\u00ad\nment to the share of McCutchen\u2019s settlements paying for\nmedical expenses; McCutchen would keep the rest (e.g.,\ndamages for loss of future earnings or pain and suffering),\neven though the plan gives US Airways first claim on the\nwhole third-party recovery. Second, McCutchen claims\nthat in equity the common-fund doctrine would have\noperated to reduce any award to US Airways. Under that\nrule, \u201ca litigant or a lawyer who recovers a common fund\nfor the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is\nentitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as a\nwhole.\u201d Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert, 444 U. S. 472, 478\n(1980). McCutchen urges that this doctrine, which is\ndesigned to prevent freeloading, enables him to pass on a\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nshare of his lawyer\u2019s fees to US Airways, no matter what\nthe plan provides.4\n   We rejected a similar claim in Sereboff, though without\naltogether foreclosing McCutchen\u2019s position. The Sere\u00ad\nboffs argued, among other things, that the lower courts\nerred in enforcing Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement clause\n\u201cwithout imposing various limitations\u201d that would \u201capply\nto truly equitable relief grounded in principles of subroga\u00ad\ntion.\u201d5 547 U. S., at 368 (internal quotation marks omit\u00ad\nted). In particular, the Sereboffs contended that a variant\nof the double-recovery rule, called the make-whole doc\u00ad\ntrine, trumped the plan\u2019s terms. We rebuffed that argu\u00ad\nment, explaining that the Sereboffs were improperly\nmixing and matching rules from different equitable boxes.\nThe Sereboffs asserted a \u201cparcel of equitable defenses\u201d\navailable when an out-of-pocket insurer brought a \u201cfree\u00ad\nstanding action for equitable subrogation,\u201d not founded on\na contract, to succeed to an insured\u2019s judgment against a\nthird party. Ibid. But Mid Atlantic\u2019s reimbursement\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Both our prior cases and secondary sources confirm McCutchen\u2019s\n\ncharacterization of the common-fund and double-recovery rules as\nderiving primarily from principles of unjust enrichment. See Boeing,\n444 U. S., at 478 (\u201cThe [common-fund] doctrine rests on the perception\nthat persons who obtain the benefit of a lawsuit without contributing to\nits cost are unjustly enriched\u201d); Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U. S.\n375, 392 (1970) (similar); 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a73.10(2), p. 395\n(2d ed. 1993) (hereinafter Dobbs) (similar); 4 G. Palmer, Law of Restitu\u00ad\ntion \u00a723.16(b), p. 444 (\u201c[T]he injured person is unjustly enriched\u201d only\nwhen he has received \u201cin excess of full compensation\u201d from two sources\n\u201cfor the same loss\u201d); 16 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law \u00a761:18\n(2d ed. 1983) (similar); 8B J. Appleman & J. Appleman, Insurance Law\nand Practice \u00a74941, p. 11 (Cum. Supp. 2012) (hereinafter Appleman)\n(similar).\n   5 \u201cSubrogation simply means substitution of one person for another;\n\nthat is, one person is allowed to stand in the shoes of another and\nassert that person\u2019s rights against\u201d a third party. 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(4), at\n604; see 8B Appleman \u00a74941, at 11 (\u201c \u2018Subrogation\u2019 involves the substi\u00ad\ntution of the insurer . . . to the rights of the insured\u201d).\n8               US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nclaim was \u201cconsidered equitable,\u201d we replied, because it\nsought to enforce a \u201c lien based on agreement \u201d\u2014not a lien\nimposed independent of contract by virtue of equitable\nsubrogation.6 Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nlight of that fact, we viewed the Sereboffs\u2019 equitable de\u00ad\nfenses\u2014which again, closely resemble McCutchen\u2019s\u2014as\n\u201cbeside the point.\u201d Ibid. And yet, we left a narrow open\u00ad\ning for future litigants in the Sereboffs\u2019 position to make a\nlike claim. In a footnote, we observed that the Sereboffs\nhad forfeited a \u201cdistinct assertion\u201d that the contract-based\nrelief Mid Atlantic requested, although \u201cequitable,\u201d was\nnot \u201cappropriate\u201d under \u00a7502(a)(3) because \u201cit contravened\nprinciples like the make-whole doctrine.\u201d Id., at 368\u2013369\nn. 2. Enter McCutchen, to make that basic argument.\n   In the end, however, Sereboff \u2019s logic dooms McCutchen\u2019s\neffort. US Airways, like Mid Atlantic, is seeking to enforce\nthe modern-day equivalent of an \u201cequitable lien by agree\u00ad\nment.\u201d And that kind of lien\u2014as its name announces\u2014\nboth arises from and serves to carry out a contract\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsions. See id., at 363\u2013364; 4 S. Symons, Pomeroy\u2019s Equity\nJurisprudence \u00a71234, p. 695 (5th ed. 1941). So enforcing\nthe lien means holding the parties to their mutual promis\u00ad\nes. See, e.g., Barnes, 232 U. S., at 121; Walker v. Brown,\n165 U. S. 654, 664 (1897). Conversely, it means declining\nto apply rules\u2014even if they would be \u201cequitable\u201d in a\ncontract\u2019s absence\u2014at odds with the parties\u2019 expressed\ncommitments. McCutchen therefore cannot rely on theo\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Sereboff Court\u2019s analysis concerned only subrogation actions\n\nbased on equitable principles independent of any agreement. A subro\u00ad\ngation action may also be founded on a contract incorporating those\nprinciples. See 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(4), at 604. US Airways suggested at oral\nargument that McCutchen\u2019s case would \u201cge[t] a lot stronger\u201d if the plan\nhere spoke only of subrogation, without separately granting a right of\nreimbursement. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18.

Those principles, as we said in\nSereboff, are \u201cbeside the point\u201d when parties demand what\nthey bargained for in a valid agreement. See Restatement\n(Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a72(2), p. 15\n(2010) (\u201cA valid contract defines the obligations of the\nparties as to matters within its scope, displacing to that\nextent any inquiry into unjust enrichment\u201d). In those\ncircumstances, hewing to the parties\u2019 exchange yields\n\u201cappropriate\u201d as well as \u201cequitable\u201d relief.\n   We have found nothing to the contrary in the historic\npractice of equity courts. McCutchen offers us a slew of\ncases in which those courts applied the double-recovery or\ncommon-fund rule to limit insurers\u2019 efforts to recoup funds\nfrom their beneficiaries\u2019 tort judgments. See Brief for\nRespondents 21\u201325. But his citations are not on point.

But in none of these cases\u2014nor in\nany other we can find\u2014did an equity court apply the\ndouble-recovery or common-fund rule to override a plain\n10             US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\ncontract term. That is, in none did an equity court do\nwhat McCutchen asks of us.\n   Nevertheless, the United States, appearing as amicus\ncuriae, claims that the common-fund rule has a special\ncapacity to trump a conflicting contract. The Government\nbegins its brief foursquare with our (and Sereboff \u2019s) analy\u00ad\nsis: In a suit like this one, to enforce an equitable lien by\nagreement, \u201cthe agreement, not general restitutionary\nprinciples of unjust enrichment, provides the measure of\nrelief due.\u201d Brief for United States 6. Because that is so,\nthe Government (naturally enough) concludes, McCutchen\ncannot invoke the double-recovery rule to defeat the plan.\nBut then the Government takes an unexpected turn.\n\u201cWhen it comes to the costs incurred\u201d by a beneficiary to\nobtain money from a third party, \u201cthe terms of the plan do\nnot control.\u201d Id., at 21. An equity court, the Government\ncontends, has \u201cinherent authority\u201d to apportion litigation\ncosts in accord with the \u201clongstanding equitable common\u00ad\nfund doctrine,\u201d even if that conflicts with the parties\u2019\ncontract. Id., at 22.\n   But if the agreement governs, the agreement governs:\nThe reasons we have given (and the Government mostly ac\u00ad\ncepts) for looking to the contract\u2019s terms do not permit an\nattorney\u2019s-fees exception. We have no doubt that the common\u00ad\nfund doctrine has deep roots in equity. See Sprague\nv. Ticonic Nat. Bank, 307 U. S. 161, 164 (1939) (tracing\nequity courts\u2019 authority over fees to the First Judiciary\nAct). Those roots, however, are set in the soil of unjust\nenrichment: To allow \u201cothers to obtain full benefit from\nthe plaintiff \u2019s efforts without contributing . . . to the litiga\u00ad\ntion expenses,\u201d we have often noted, \u201cwould be to enrich\nthe others unjustly at the plaintiff \u2019s expense.\u201d Mills v.\nElectric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.

And as we have\njust explained, principles of unjust enrichment give way\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

The agreement itself becomes the measure\nof the parties\u2019 equities; so if a contract abrogates the com\u00ad\nmon-fund doctrine, the insurer is not unjustly enriched by\nclaiming the benefit of its bargain. That is why the Gov\u00ad\nernment, like McCutchen, fails to produce a single case in\nwhich an equity court applied the common-fund rule (any\nmore than the double-recovery rule) when a contract\nprovided to the contrary. Even in equity, when a party\nsought to enforce a lien by agreement, all provisions of\nthat agreement controlled. So too, then, in a suit like this\none.\n   The result we reach, based on the historical analysis our\nprior cases prescribe, fits lock and key with ERISA\u2019s focus\non what a plan provides. The section under which this\nsuit is brought \u201cdoes not, after all, authorize \u2018appropriate\nequitable relief \u2019 at large,\u201d Mertens, 508 U. S., at 253 (quot\u00ad\ning \u00a71132(a)(3)); rather, it countenances only such relief\nas will enforce \u201cthe terms of the plan\u201d or the statute,\n\u00a71132(a)(3) (emphasis added). That limitation reflects\nERISA\u2019s principal function: to \u201cprotect contractually de\u00ad\nfined benefits.\u201d Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Rus-\nsell, 473 U. S. 134, 148 (1985). The statutory scheme, we\nhave often noted, \u201cis built around reliance on the face\nof written plan documents.\u201d Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.\nSchoonejongen, 514 U.

The plan, in short, is at the\ncenter of ERISA. And precluding McCutchen\u2019s equitable\ndefenses from overriding plain contract terms helps it to\nremain there.\n12               US AIRWAYS, INC. v.

If\nthe equitable rules he describes cannot trump a reim\u00ad\nbursement provision, they still might aid in properly\nconstruing it. And for US Airways\u2019 plan, the common-fund\ndoctrine (though not the double-recovery rule) serves that\nfunction. The plan is silent on the allocation of attorney\u2019s\nfees, and in those circumstances, the common-fund doc\u00ad\ntrine provides the appropriate default. In other words, if\nUS Airways wished to depart from the well-established\ncommon-fund rule, it had to draft its contract to say so\u2014\nand here it did not.7\n   Ordinary principles of contract interpretation point\ntoward this conclusion. Courts construe ERISA plans, as\nthey do other contracts, by \u201clooking to the terms of the\nplan\u201d as well as to \u201cother manifestations of the parties\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The dissent faults us for addressing this issue, but we think it ade\u00ad\n\nquately preserved and presented. The language the dissent highlights\nin McCutchen\u2019s brief in opposition, indicating that the plan clearly\nabrogates the common-fund doctrine, comes from his description of US\nAirways\u2019 claim in the District Court. See post, at 1 (opinion of SCALIA,\nJ.); Brief in Opposition 5. McCutchen\u2019s argument in that court urged\nthe very position we adopt\u2014that the common-fund doctrine applies\nbecause the plan is silent. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; Defendants\u2019\nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judg\u00ad\nment in No. 2:08\u2013cv\u20131593 (WD Pa., Dec. 4, 2011), Doc. 33, pp. 12\u201313\n(\u201cIf [US Airways] wanted to exclude a deduction for attorney fees, it\neasily could have so expressed\u201d). To be sure, McCutchen shifted ground\non appeal because the District Court ruled that Third Circuit precedent\nforeclosed his contract-based argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a;\nthe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision then put front-and-center his alternative\ncontention that the common-fund rule trumps a contract. But both\nclaims have the same basis (the nature and function of the common\u00ad\nfund doctrine), which the parties have disputed throughout this litiga\u00ad\ntion. And similarly, the question we decide here is included in the\nquestion presented. The principal clause of that question asks whether\na court may use \u201cequitable principles to rewrite contractual language.\u201d\nPet. for Cert. i. We answer \u201cnot rewrite, but inform\u201d\u2014a reply well\nwithin the question\u2019s scope.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

The words of a plan may speak clearly,\nbut they may also leave gaps. And so a court must often\n\u201clook outside the plan\u2019s written language\u201d to decide what\nan agreement means. CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (slip op., at 13); see Curtiss-Wright, 514 U. S., at\n80\u201381. In undertaking that task, a court properly takes\naccount of background legal rules\u2014the doctrines that\ntypically or traditionally have governed a given situation\nwhen no agreement states otherwise. See Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. Assoc. Health & Welfare Plan v. Wells, 213\nF. 3d 398, 402 (CA7 2000) (Posner, J.) (\u201c[C]ontracts . . . are\nenacted against a background of common-sense under\u00ad\nstandings and legal principles that the parties may not\nhave bothered to incorporate expressly but that operate as\ndefault rules to govern in the absence of a clear expression\nof the parties\u2019 [contrary] intent\u201d); 11 R. Lord, Williston on\nContracts \u00a731:7 (4th ed. 2012); Restatement (Second) of\nContracts \u00a7221 (1979). Indeed, ignoring those rules is\nlikely to frustrate the parties\u2019 intent and produce perverse\nconsequences.\n   The reimbursement provision at issue here precludes\nlooking to the double-recovery rule in this manner. Both\nthe contract term and the equitable principle address the\nsame problem: how to apportion, as between an insurer\nand a beneficiary, a third party\u2019s payment to recompense\nan injury. But the allocation formulas they prescribe\ndiffer markedly. According to the plan, US Airways has\nfirst claim on the entire recovery\u2014as the plan description\nstates, on \u201cany monies recovered from [the] third party\u201d;\nMcCutchen receives only whatever is left over (if any\u00ad\nthing). See supra, at 3. By contrast, the double-recovery\nrule would give McCutchen first dibs on the portion of the\nrecovery compensating for losses that the plan did not\ncover (e.g., future earnings or pain and suffering); US\nAirways\u2019 claim would attach only to the share of the recov\u00ad\n14            US AIRWAYS, INC. v. MCCUTCHEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nery for medical expenses. See supra, at 6\u20137. The express\ncontract term, in short, contradicts the background equi\u00ad\ntable rule; and where that is so, for all the reasons we\nhave given, the agreement must govern.\n   By contrast, the plan provision here leaves space for the\ncommon-fund rule to operate. That equitable doctrine, as\nearlier noted, addresses not how to allocate a third-party\nrecovery, but instead how to pay for the costs of obtaining\nit. See supra, at 7. And the contract, for its part, says\nnothing specific about that issue. The District Court\nbelow thus erred when it found that the plan clearly repu\u00ad\ndiated the common-fund rule. See supra, at 4. To be sure,\nthe plan\u2019s allocation formula\u2014first claim on the recovery\ngoes to US Airways\u2014might operate on every dollar re\u00ad\nceived from a third party, even those covering the benefi\u00ad\nciary\u2019s litigation costs. But alternatively, that formula\ncould apply to only the true recovery, after the costs of\nobtaining it are deducted. (Consider, for comparative\npurposes, how an income tax is levied on net, not gross,\nreceipts.) See Dawson, Lawyers and Involuntary Clients:\nAttorney Fees From Funds, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 1597, 1606\u2013\n1607 (1974) (\u201c[T]he claim for legal services is a first charge\non the fund and must be satisfied before any distribution\noccurs\u201d). The plan\u2019s terms fail to select between these two\nalternatives: whether the recovery to which US Airways\nhas first claim is every cent the third party paid or, in\u00ad\nstead, the money the beneficiary took away.\n   Given that contractual gap, the common-fund doctrine\nprovides the best indication of the parties\u2019 intent. No one\ncan doubt that the common-fund rule would govern here\nin the absence of a contrary agreement. This Court has\n\u201crecognized consistently\u201d that someone \u201cwho recovers a\ncommon fund for the benefit of persons other than him\u00ad\nself\u201d is due \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the fund as\nwhole.\u201d Boeing Co., 444 U.

And we have applied it in a wide range\nof circumstances as part of our inherent authority. See\nBoeing Co., 444 U. S., at 474, 478; Hall v. Cole, 412 U.

S. 116, 126\u2013127 (1885); Green-\nough, 105 U. S., at 528, 531\u2013533. State courts have done\nthe same; the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d routinely use the\ncommon-fund rule to allocate the costs of third-party\nrecoveries between insurers and beneficiaries. 8A Apple\u00ad\nman \u00a74903.85, at 335 (1981); see Annot., 2 A. L. R. 3d\n1441, \u00a7\u00a72\u20133 (1965 and Supp. 2012). A party would not\ntypically expect or intend a plan saying nothing about\nattorney\u2019s fees to abrogate so strong and uniform a back\u00ad\nground rule. And that means a court should be loath to\nread such a plan in that way.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 For that reason, almost every state court that has confronted the\nissue has done what we do here: apply the common-fund doctrine in\nthe face of a contract giving an insurer a general right to recoup funds\nfrom an insured\u2019s third-party recovery, without specifically addressing\nattorney\u2019s fees.

MCCUTCHEN\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n  The rationale for the common-fund rule reinforces that\nconclusion. Third-party recoveries do not often come free:\nTo get one, an insured must incur lawyer\u2019s fees and ex\u00ad\npenses. Without cost sharing, the insurer free rides on its\nbeneficiary\u2019s efforts\u2014taking the fruits while contributing\nnothing to the labor. Odder still, in some cases\u2014indeed,\nin this case\u2014the beneficiary is made worse off by pursuing\na third party. Recall that McCutchen spent $44,000 (rep\u00ad\nresenting a 40% contingency fee) to get $110,000, leaving\nhim with a real recovery of $66,000. But US Airways\nclaimed $66,866 in medical expenses. That would put\nMcCutchen $866 in the hole; in effect, he would pay for the\nprivilege of serving as US Airways\u2019 collection agent. We\nthink McCutchen would not have foreseen that result\nwhen he signed on to the plan. And we doubt if even US\nAirways should want it. When the next McCutchen comes\nalong, he is not likely to relieve US Airways of the costs of\nrecovery. See Blackburn v. Sundstrand Corp., 115 F. 3d\n493, 496 (CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (\u201c[I]f . . . injured\npersons could not charge legal costs against recoveries,\npeople like [McCutchen] would in the future have every\nreason\u201d to make different judgments about bringing suit,\n\u201cthrowing on plans the burden and expense of collection\u201d).\nThe prospect of generating those strange results again\nmilitates against reading a general reimbursement provi\u00ad\nsion\u2014like the one here\u2014for more than it is worth. Only if\nUS Airways\u2019 plan expressly addressed the costs of recovery\nwould it alter the common-fund doctrine.\n                           IV\n  Our holding today has two parts, one favoring US Air\u00ad\nways, the other McCutchen. First, in an action brought\nunder \u00a7502(a)(3) based on an equitable lien by agreement,\nthe terms of the ERISA plan govern. Neither general\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n271, 273\u2013274, 278 (1976).\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

But\nsecond, the common-fund rule informs interpretation of\nUS Airways\u2019 reimbursement provision. Because that term\ndoes not advert to the costs of recovery, it is properly read\nto retain the common-fund doctrine. We therefore also\ndisagree with the District Court\u2019s decision. In light of\nthese rulings, we vacate the judgment below and re-\nmand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
