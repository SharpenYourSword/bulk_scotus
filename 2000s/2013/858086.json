SYMCZYK\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u20131059. Argued December 3, 2012\u2014Decided April 16, 2013\nRespondent brought a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards\n  Act of 1938 (FLSA) on behalf of herself and \u201cother employees similar-\n  ly situated.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b). After she ignored petitioners\u2019 offer\n  of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, the District\n  Court, finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that\n  the Rule 68 offer fully satisfied her claim, concluded that respond-\n  ent\u2019s suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of subject-matter juris-\n  diction. The Third Circuit reversed. It held that respondent\u2019s indi-\n  vidual claim was moot but that her collective action was not,\n  explaining that allowing defendants to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs be-\n  fore certification with calculated Rule 68 offers would frustrate the\n  goals of collective actions. The case was remanded to the District\n  Court to allow respondent to seek \u201cconditional certification,\u201d which, if\n  successful, would relate back to the date of her complaint.\nHeld: Because respondent had no personal interest in representing pu-\n tative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that\n would preserve her suit from mootness, her suit was appropriately\n dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an unaccepted\n Rule 68 offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff\u2019s individual claim is suffi-\n cient to render that claim moot, respondent conceded the issue below\n and did not properly raise it here. Thus, this Court assumes, without\n deciding, that petitioners\u2019 offer mooted her individual claim. Pp. 3\u20135.\n    (b) Well-settled mootness principles control the outcome of this\n case. After respondent\u2019s individual claim became moot, the suit be-\n came moot because she had no personal interest in representing oth-\n ers in the action. To avoid that outcome, respondent relies on cases\n that arose in the context of Rule 23 class actions, but they are inap-\n2             GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    posite, both because Rule 23 actions are fundamentally different from\n    FLSA collective actions and because the cases are inapplicable to the\n    facts here. Pp. 5\u201311.\n         (1) Neither Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, nor United States Pa-\n    role Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, support respondent\u2019s posi-\n    tion. Geraghty extended the principles of Sosna\u2014which held that a\n    class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff\u2019s individ-\n    ual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified\u2014to\n    denials of class certification motions; and it provided that, where an\n    action would have acquired independent legal status but for the dis-\n    trict court\u2019s erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling\n    on appeal \u201crelates back\u201d to the time of the erroneous denial. 445\n    U. S., at 404, and n. 11. However, Geraghty\u2019s holding was explicitly\n    limited to cases in which the named plaintiff \u2019s claim remains live at\n    the time the district court denies class certification. See id., at 407,\n    n. 11. Here, respondent had not yet moved for \u201cconditional certifica-\n    tion\u201d when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court antici-\n    patorily ruled on any such request. She thus has no certification de-\n    cision to which her claim could have related back.                  More\n    fundamentally, essential to Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a\n    putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified\n    under Rule 23. By contrast, under the FLSA, \u201cconditional certifica-\n    tion\u201d does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or\n    join additional parties to the action. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) A line of cases holding that an \u201cinherently transitory\u201d class-\n    action claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the\n    named plaintiff\u2019s claim, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n    500 U. S. 44, 52, is similarly inapplicable. Respondent argues that a\n    defendant\u2019s use of Rule 68 offers to \u201cpick off\u201d a named plaintiff before\n    the collective-action process is complete renders the action \u201cinherent-\n    ly transitory.\u201d But this rationale was developed to address circum-\n    stances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable\n    because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long\n    enough for litigation to run its course, and it has invariably focused\n    on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the\n    claim, not on the defendant\u2019s litigation strategy. Unlike a claim for\n    injunctive relief, a damages claim cannot evade review, nor can an of-\n    fer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review. Putative\n    plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respond-\n    ent\u2019s suit, but they remain free to do so in their own suits. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (3) Finally, Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326,\n    does not support respondent\u2019s claim that the purposes served by the\n    FLSA\u2019s collective-action provisions would be frustrated by defend-\n    ants\u2019 use of Rule 68 to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs before the collective-\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

In Roper, where the named plain-\n  tiffs\u2019 individual claims became moot after the District Court denied\n  their Rule 23 class certification motion and entered judgment in their\n  favor based on defendant\u2019s offer of judgment, this Court found that\n  the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because\n  they possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substan-\n  tive controversy, namely, to shift a portion of attorney\u2019s fees and ex-\n  penses to successful class litigants. Here, respondent conceded that\n  petitioners\u2019 offer provided complete relief, and she asserted no con-\n  tinuing economic interest in shifting attorney\u2019s fees and costs. More-\n  over, Roper was tethered to the unique significance of Rule 23 class\n  certification decisions.

LAURA SYMCZYK \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 16, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7201 et seq., provides that an employee may bring\nan action to recover damages for specified violations of the\nAct on behalf of himself and other \u201csimilarly situated\u201d\nemployees. We granted certiorari to resolve whether such\na case is justiciable when the lone plaintiff \u2019s individual\nclaim becomes moot. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). We hold that it\nis not justiciable.\n                             I\n   The FLSA establishes federal minimum-wage, maximum-\nhour, and overtime guarantees that cannot be modified\nby contract. Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 52 Stat. 1060, as\namended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), gives employees the right\nto bring a private cause of action on their own behalf and\non behalf of \u201cother employees similarly situated\u201d for speci-\nfied violations of the FLSA. A suit brought on behalf of\nother employees is known as a \u201ccollective action.\u201d See\nHoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165, 169\u2013\n170 (1989).\n   In 2009, respondent, who was formerly employed by\n2         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners as a registered nurse at Pennypack Center in\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a complaint on behalf of\nherself and \u201call other persons similarly situated.\u201d App.\n115\u2013116. Respondent alleged that petitioners violated the\nFLSA by automatically deducting 30 minutes of time\nworked per shift for meal breaks for certain employees,\neven when the employees performed compensable work\nduring those breaks. Respondent, who remained the sole\nplaintiff throughout these proceedings, sought statutory\ndamages for the alleged violations.\n   When petitioners answered the complaint, they simul-\ntaneously served upon respondent an offer of judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The offer in-\ncluded $7,500 for alleged unpaid wages, in addition to\n\u201csuch reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses . . .\nas the Court may determine.\u201d Id., at 77. Petition-\ners stipulated that if respondent did not accept the offer\nwithin 10 days after service, the offer would be deemed\nwithdrawn.\n   After respondent failed to respond in the allotted time\nperiod, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioners argued that be-\ncause they offered respondent complete relief on her indi-\nvidual damages claim, she no longer possessed a personal\nstake in the outcome of the suit, rendering the action\nmoot. Respondent objected, arguing that petitioners were\ninappropriately attempting to \u201cpick off \u201d the named plain-\ntiff before the collective-action process could unfold. Id., at\n91.\n   The District Court found that it was undisputed that no\nother individuals had joined respondent\u2019s suit and that the\nRule 68 offer of judgment fully satisfied her individual\nclaim. It concluded that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer of judg-\nment mooted respondent\u2019s suit, which it dismissed for lack\nof subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed. 656 F. 3d 189 (CA3\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2011). The court agreed that no other potential plaintiff\nhad opted into the suit, that petitioners\u2019 offer fully satis-\nfied respondent\u2019s individual claim, and that, under its\nprecedents, whether or not such an offer is accepted, it\ngenerally moots a plaintiff \u2019s claim. Id., at 195. But the\ncourt nevertheless held that respondent\u2019s collective action\nwas not moot. It explained that calculated attempts by\nsome defendants to \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs with stra-\ntegic Rule 68 offers before certification could short circuit\nthe process, and, thereby, frustrate the goals of collective\nactions. Id., at 196\u2013198. The court determined that the\ncase must be remanded in order to allow respondent to\nseek \u201cconditional certification\u201d1 in the District Court. If\nrespondent were successful, the District Court was to\nrelate the certification motion back to the date on which\nrespondent filed her complaint.2 Ibid.\n                              II\n  Article III, \u00a72, of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction\nof federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Lower   courts have borrowed class-action terminology to describe the\nprocess of joining co-plaintiffs under 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b). While we do\nnot express an opinion on the propriety of this use of class-action\nnomenclature, we do note that there are significant differences between\ncertification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the joinder\nprocess under \u00a7216(b).\n   2 The \u201crelation back\u201d doctrine was developed in the context of class\n\nactions under Rule 23 to address the circumstance in which a named\nplaintiff\u2019s claim becomes moot prior to certification of the class. This\ncase raises two circumstances in which the Court has applied this\ndoctrine. First, where a named plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cinherently transi-\ntory,\u201d and becomes moot prior to certification, a motion for certification\nmay \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint. See, e.g., County of\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 51\u201352 (1991). Second, we have\nheld that where a certification motion is denied and a named plaintiff\u2019s\nclaim subsequently becomes moot, an appellate reversal of the certifica-\ntion decision may relate back to the time of the denial. See United\nStates Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980).\n4         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrestricts the authority of federal courts to resolving \u201c \u2018the\nlegal rights of litigants in actual controversies,\u2019 \u201d Valley\nForge Christian College v. Americans United for Separa-\ntion of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471 (1982)\n(quoting Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v.\nCommissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885)). In\norder to invoke federal-court jurisdiction, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate that he possesses a legally cognizable inter-\nest, or \u201c \u2018personal stake,\u2019 \u201d in the outcome of the action. See\nCamreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5)\n(quoting Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S. 488,\n493 (2009)). This requirement ensures that the Federal\nJudiciary confines itself to its constitutionally limited role\nof adjudicating actual and concrete disputes, the resolu-\ntions of which have direct consequences on the parties\ninvolved.\n   A corollary to this case-or-controversy requirement is\nthat \u201c \u2018an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u2019 \u201d\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67\n(1997) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401\n(1975)). If an intervening circumstance deprives the\nplaintiff of a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the law-\nsuit,\u201d at any point during litigation, the action can no\nlonger proceed and must be dismissed as moot. Lewis v.\nContinental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477\u2013478 (1990)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In the proceedings below, both courts concluded that\npetitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer afforded respondent complete\nrelief on\u2014and thus mooted\u2014her FLSA claim. See 656\nF. 3d, at 201; No. 09\u20135782, 2010 WL 2038676, *4 (ED Pa.,\nMay 19, 2010). Respondent now contends that these\nrulings were erroneous, because petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer\nlapsed without entry of judgment. Brief for Respondent\n12\u201316. The United States, as amicus curiae, similarly\nurges the Court to hold that petitioners\u2019 unaccepted offer\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ndid not moot her FLSA claim and to affirm the Court of\nAppeals on this basis. Brief for United States 10\u201315.\n  While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an un-\naccepted offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff \u2019s claim is\nsufficient to render the claim moot,3 we do not reach this\nquestion, or resolve the split, because the issue is not\nproperly before us. The Third Circuit clearly held in this\ncase that respondent\u2019s individual claim was moot. 656\nF. 3d, at 201. Acceptance of respondent\u2019s argument to the\ncontrary now would alter the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment,\nwhich is impermissible in the absence of a cross-petition\nfrom respondent. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of\nKent, 510 U. S. 355, 364 (1994); Trans World Airlines, Inc.\nv. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 119, n. 14 (1985). Moreover,\neven if the cross-petition rule did not apply, respondent\u2019s\nwaiver of the issue would still prevent us from reaching it.\nIn the District Court, respondent conceded that \u201c[a]n offer\nof complete relief will generally moot the [plaintiff \u2019s]\nclaim, as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal\ninterest in the outcome of the litigation.\u201d App. 93; 2010\nWL 2038676, at *4. Respondent made a similar conces-\nsion in her brief to the Court of Appeals, see App. 193, and\nfailed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to\nthe petition for certiorari. We, therefore, assume, without\ndeciding, that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer mooted respond-\nent\u2019s individual claim. See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27,\n34 (2004).\n                            III\n   We turn, then, to the question whether respondent\u2019s\naction remained justiciable based on the collective-action\nallegations in her complaint. A straightforward applica-\ntion of well-settled mootness principles compels our an-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare, e.g., Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3\n\n2004), with McCauley v. Trans Union, LLC, 402 F. 3d 340, 342 (CA2\n2005).\n6           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nswer. In the absence of any claimant\u2019s opting in, respond-\nent\u2019s suit became moot when her individual claim became\nmoot, because she lacked any personal interest in repre-\nsenting others in this action. While the FLSA authorizes\nan aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of\nhimself and \u201cother employees similarly situated,\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7216(b), the mere presence of collective-action\nallegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from\nmootness once the individual claim is satisfied.4 In order\nto avoid this outcome, respondent relies almost entirely\nupon cases that arose in the context of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23 class actions, particularly United\nStates Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388 (1980);\nDeposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326\n(1980); and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393 (1975). But these\ncases are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are\nfundamentally different from collective actions under the\nFLSA, see Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 493 U. S., at 177\u2013178\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), and because these cases are, by\ntheir own terms, inapplicable to these facts. It follows\nthat this action was appropriately dismissed as moot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 While we do not resolve the question whether a Rule 68 offer that\n\nfully satisfies the plaintiff\u2019s claims is sufficient by itself to moot the\naction, supra, at 5, we note that Courts of Appeals on both sides of that\nissue have recognized that a plaintiff\u2019s claim may be satisfied even\nwithout the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Some courts maintain that an unac-\ncepted offer of complete relief alone is sufficient to moot the individual\u2019s\nclaim. E.g., Weiss, supra, at 340; Greisz v. Household Bank (Ill.), N. A.,\n176 F. 3d 1012, 1015 (CA7 1999). Other courts have held that, in the\nface of an unaccepted offer of complete relief, district courts may \u201center\njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with the defendants\u2019\nRule 68 offer of judgment.\u201d O\u2019Brien v.

Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, see post,\nat 8 (opinion of Kagan, J.), nothing in the nature of FLSA actions\nprecludes satisfaction\u2014and thus the mooting\u2014of the individual\u2019s claim\nbefore the collective-action component of the suit has run its course.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               A\n\n   Respondent contends that she has a sufficient personal\nstake in this case based on a statutorily created collective-\naction interest in representing other similarly situated\nemployees under \u00a7216(b). Brief for Respondent 47\u201348. In\nsupport of her argument, respondent cites our decision in\nGeraghty, which in turn has its roots in Sosna. Neither\ncase supports her position.\n   In Sosna, the Court held that a class action is not ren-\ndered moot when the named plaintiff \u2019s individual claim\nbecomes moot after the class has been duly certified. 419\nU. S., at 399. The Court reasoned that when a district\ncourt certifies a class, \u201cthe class of unnamed persons\ndescribed in the certification acquire[s] a legal status\nseparate from the interest asserted by [the named plain-\ntiff],\u201d with the result that a live controversy may continue\nto exist, even after the claim of the named plaintiff be-\ncomes moot. Id., at 399\u2013402. Geraghty narrowly extended\nthis principle to denials of class certification motions. The\nCourt held that where an action would have acquired the\nindependent legal status described in Sosna but for the\ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous denial of class certification, a\ncorrected ruling on appeal \u201crelates back\u201d to the time of the\nerroneous denial of the certification motion. 445 U. S., at\n404, and n. 11.\n   Geraghty is inapposite, because the Court explicitly\nlimited its holding to cases in which the named plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim remains live at the time the district court denies\nclass certification. See id., at 407, n. 11. Here, respondent\nhad not yet moved for \u201cconditional certification\u201d when her\nclaim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipa-\ntorily ruled on any such request. Her claim instead became\nmoot prior to these events, foreclosing any recourse to\nGeraghty. There is simply no certification decision to\nwhich respondent\u2019s claim could have related back.\n   More fundamentally, essential to our decisions in Sosna\n8         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires\nan independent legal status once it is certified under Rule\n23. Under the FLSA, by contrast, \u201cconditional certifica-\ntion\u201d does not produce a class with an independent legal\nstatus, or join additional parties to the action. The sole\nconsequence of conditional certification is the sending of\ncourt-approved written notice to employees, see Hoffmann-\nLa Roche Inc., supra, at 171\u2013172, who in turn become\nparties to a collective action only by filing written con-\nsent with the court, \u00a7216(b). So even if respondent were\nto secure a conditional certification ruling on remand,\nnothing in that ruling would preserve her suit from\nmootness.\n                                B\n   Respondent also advances an argument based on a\nseparate, but related, line of cases in which the Court held\nthat an \u201cinherently transitory\u201d class-action claim is not\nnecessarily moot upon the termination of the named plain-\ntiff \u2019s claim. Like our decision in Geraghty, this line of\ncases began with Sosna and is similarly inapplicable here.\n   After concluding that the expiration of a named plain-\ntiff \u2019s claim following certification does not moot the class\naction, Sosna suggested that, where a named plaintiff\u2019s\nindividual claim becomes moot before the district court\nhas an opportunity to rule on the certification motion, and\nthe issue would otherwise evade review, the certification\nmight \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint. 419\nU. S., at 402, n. 11. The Court has since held that the\nrelation-back doctrine may apply in Rule 23 cases where it\nis \u201ccertain that other persons similarly situated\u201d will\ncontinue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the\nclaims raised are \u201c \u2018so inherently transitory that the trial\ncourt will not have even enough time to rule on a motion\nfor class certification before the proposed representative\u2019s\nindividual interest expires.\u2019 \u201d      County of Riverside v.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 52 (1991) (quoting Geraghty,\nsupra, at 399), in turn citing Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S.\n103, 110, n. 11 (1975)). Invoking this doctrine, respondent\nargues that defendants can strategically use Rule 68 offers\nto \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs before the collective-action\nprocess is complete, rendering collective actions \u201cinher-\nently transitory\u201d in effect. Brief for Respondent 37.\n   Our cases invoking the \u201cinherently transitory\u201d relation-\nback rationale do not apply. The \u201cinherently transitory\u201d\nrationale was developed to address circumstances in which\nthe challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable,\nbecause no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit\nlong enough for litigation to run its course. A plaintiff\nmight seek, for instance, to bring a class action challeng-\ning the constitutionality of temporary pretrial detentions.\nIn doing so, the named plaintiff would face the considera-\nble challenge of preserving his individual claim from\nmootness, since pretrial custody likely would end prior to\nthe resolution of his claim. See Gerstein, supra. To ad-\ndress this problem, the Court explained that in cases\nwhere the transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to\nthe suit would effectively insulate defendants\u2019 conduct\nfrom review, certification could potentially \u201crelate back\u201d to\nthe filing of the complaint. Id., at 110, n. 11; McLaughlin,\nsupra, at 52. But this doctrine has invariably focused on\nthe fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to\nthe claim, not on the defendant\u2019s litigation strategy. See,\ne.g., Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204, 214, n. 11 (1978);\nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17\u201318 (1998).\n   In this case, respondent\u2019s complaint requested statutory\ndamages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging\nongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade re-\nview; it remains live until it is settled, judicially resolved,\nor barred by a statute of limitations. Nor can a defend-\nant\u2019s attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim\nfrom review, for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff \u2019s\n10         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nalleged harm by making the plaintiff whole. While set-\ntlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing un-\njoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in\nrespondent\u2019s suit, such putative plaintiffs remain free to\nvindicate their rights in their own suits. They are no less\nable to have their claims settled or adjudicated following\nrespondent\u2019s suit than if her suit had never been filed at\nall.\n                              C\n   Finally, respondent argues that the purposes served\nby the FLSA\u2019s collective-action provisions\u2014for example,\nefficient resolution of common claims and lower individual\ncosts associated with litigation\u2014would be frustrated by\ndefendants\u2019 use of Rule 68 to \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs\nbefore the collective-action process has run its course.\nBoth respondent and the Court of Appeals purported to\nfind support for this position in our decision in Roper, 445\nU. S., at 339.\n   In Roper, the named plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims became\nmoot after the District Court denied their motion for class\ncertification under Rule 23 and subsequently entered\njudgment in their favor, based on the defendant bank\u2019s\noffer of judgment for the maximum recoverable amount of\ndamages, in addition to interest and court costs. Id., at\n329\u2013330. The Court held that even though the District\nCourt had entered judgment in the named plaintiffs\u2019 favor,\nthey could nevertheless appeal the denial of their motion\nto certify the class. The Court found that, under the par-\nticular circumstances of that case, the named plaintiffs\npossessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the\nsubstantive controversy\u2014namely, to shift a portion of\nattorney\u2019s fees and expenses to successful class litigants.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Because Roper is distinguishable on the facts, we need not consider\n\nits continuing validity in light of our subsequent decision in Lewis v.\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

Only then, in dicta, did the\nCourt underscore the importance of a district court\u2019s class\ncertification decision and observe that allowing defendants\nto \u201c \u2018pic[k] off\u2019\u201d party plaintiffs before an affirmative ruling\nwas achieved \u201cwould frustrate the objectives of class ac-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 339.\n   Roper\u2019s holding turned on a specific factual finding that\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 possessed a continuing personal economic\nstake in the litigation, even after the defendants\u2019 offer of\njudgment. Id., at 336. As already explained, here, re-\nspondent conceded that petitioners\u2019 offer \u201cprovided com-\nplete relief on her individual claims,\u201d Brief in Opposition i,\nand she failed to assert any continuing economic interest\nin shifting attorney\u2019s fees and costs to others. Moreover,\nRoper\u2019s dictum was tethered to the unique significance of\ncertification decisions in class-action proceedings. 445\nU. S., at 339. Whatever significance \u201cconditional certifica-\ntion\u201d may have in \u00a7216(b) proceedings, it is not tanta-\nmount to class certification under Rule 23.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that respondent\u2019s indi-\nvidual claim became moot following petitioners\u2019 Rule 68\noffer of judgment. We have assumed, without deciding,\nthat this is correct.\n  Reaching the question on which we granted certiorari,\nwe conclude that respondent has no personal interest in\nrepresenting putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other\ncontinuing interest that would preserve her suit from\nmootness. Respondent\u2019s suit was, therefore, appropriately\ndismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nContinental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472 (1990).

The issue here, the majority tells us, is\nwhether a \u201c \u2018 collective action\u2019 \u201d brought under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7201\net seq., \u201cis justiciable when the lone plaintiff\u2019s individual\nclaim becomes moot.\u201d Ante, at 1. Embedded within that\nquestion is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has\nbecome moot, as the lower courts held and the majority\nassumes without deciding. But what if that premise is\nbogus? What if the plaintiff\u2019s individual claim here never\nbecame moot? And what if, in addition, no similar claim\nfor damages will ever become moot? In that event, the\nmajority\u2019s decision\u2014founded as it is on an unfounded\nassumption\u2014would have no real-world meaning or appli\u00ad\ncation. The decision would turn out to be the most one-off\nof one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks)\nshould happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when\nsomething that in fact never happens to an individual\nFLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so. That is\nthe case here, for reasons I\u2019ll describe. Feel free to rele\u00ad\ngate the majority\u2019s decision to the furthest reaches of your\n2         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmind: The situation it addresses should never again arise.\n   Consider the facts of this case, keeping an eye out for\nanything that would render any part of it moot. Respond\u00ad\nent Laura Symczyk brought suit under a provision of the\nFLSA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), \u201con behalf of herself and others\nsimilarly situated.\u201d App. 21. Her complaint alleged\nthat her former employer, petitioner Genesis Healthcare\nCorporation (Genesis), violated the FLSA by treating\n30 minutes of every shift as an unpaid meal break, even\nwhen an employee worked during that time. Genesis\nanswered the complaint and simultaneously made an offer\nof judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.\nThat settlement proposal covered only Symczyk\u2019s individ\u00ad\nual claim, to the tune of $7,500 in lost wages. The offer,\naccording to its terms, would \u201cbe deemed withdrawn\u201d if\nSymczyk did not accept it within 10 days. App. 79. That\ndeadline came and went without any reply. The case then\nproceeded in the normal fashion, with the District Court\nsetting a schedule for discovery. Pause here for a moment\nto ask whether you\u2019ve seen anything yet that would moot\nSymczyk\u2019s individual claim. No? Neither have I.\n   Nevertheless, Genesis moved to dismiss Symczyk\u2019s suit\non the ground that it was moot. The supposed logic went\nlike this: We (i.e., Genesis) offered Symczyk complete relief\non her individual damages claim; she \u201ceffectively reject[ed]\nthe [o]ffer\u201d by failing to respond; because she did so, she\n\u201cno longer has a personal stake or legally cognizable inter\u00ad\nest in the outcome of this action\u201d; accordingly, the court\n\u201cshould dismiss her claims.\u201d Id., at 67. Relying on Circuit\nprecedent, the District Court agreed; it dismissed the case\nfor lack of jurisdiction\u2014without awarding Symczyk any\ndamages or other relief\u2014based solely on the unaccepted\noffer Genesis had made. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 35\n(citing Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3\n2004)). And finally, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit concurred that Genesis\u2019s offer mooted Symczyk\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nindividual claim (though also holding that she could still\nproceed with a collective action). See 656 F. 3d 189 (2011).\n   That thrice-asserted view is wrong, wrong, and wrong\nagain. We made clear earlier this Term that \u201c[a]s long as\nthe parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the\noutcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d Chafin v.\nChafin, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). By those measures, an unac\u00ad\ncepted offer of judgment cannot moot a case. When a\nplaintiff rejects such an offer\u2014however good the terms\u2014\nher interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was be\u00ad\nfore. And so too does the court\u2019s ability to grant her relief.\nAn unaccepted settlement offer\u2014like any unaccepted\ncontract offer\u2014is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.\nAs every first-year law student learns, the recipient\u2019s re-\njection of an offer \u201cleaves the matter as if no offer had\never been made.\u201d Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Co-\nlumbus Rolling Mill, 119 U. S. 149, 151 (1886). Nothing\nin Rule 68 alters that basic principle; to the contrary, that\nrule specifies that \u201c[a]n unaccepted offer is considered\nwithdrawn.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(b). So assuming the\ncase was live before\u2014because the plaintiff had a stake and\nthe court could grant relief\u2014the litigation carries on,\nunmooted.\n   For this reason, Symczyk\u2019s individual claim was alive\nand well when the District Court dismissed her suit.\nRecall: Genesis made a settlement offer under Rule 68;\nSymczyk decided not to accept it; after 10 days, it expired\nand the suit went forward. Symczyk\u2019s individual stake in\nthe lawsuit thus remained what it had always been, and\nditto the court\u2019s capacity to grant her relief. After the\noffer lapsed, just as before, Symczyk possessed an unsatis\u00ad\nfied claim, which the court could redress by awarding her\n4           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndamages. As long as that remained true, Symczyk\u2019s claim\nwas not moot, and the District Court could not send her\naway empty-handed. So a friendly suggestion to the Third\nCircuit: Rethink your mootness-by-unaccepted-offer theo\u00ad\nry. And a note to all other courts of appeals: Don\u2019t try this\nat home.\n   To this point, what I have said conflicts with nothing in\nthe Court\u2019s opinion. The majority does not attempt to\nargue, \u00e0 la the Third Circuit, that the unaccepted settle\u00ad\nment offer mooted Symczyk\u2019s individual damages claim.\nInstead, the majority hangs its hat on a finding of waiver.\nSee ante, at 5, 11. The majority notes\u2014correctly\u2014that\nSymczyk accepted the Third Circuit\u2019s rule in her briefs\nbelow, and also failed to challenge it in her brief in opposi\u00ad\ntion to the petition for certiorari; she contested it first in\nher merits brief before this Court. That enables the ma\u00ad\njority to \u201cassume, without deciding,\u201d the mootness of\nSymczyk\u2019s individual claim and reach the oh-so-much\u00ad\nmore-interesting question relating to her proposed collec\u00ad\ntive action. Ante, at 5.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The majority also justifies this approach on the ground that\n\nSymczyk did not file a cross-petition for certiorari objecting to the Third\nCircuit\u2019s decision. But that is because Symczyk got the judgment she\nwanted in the Third Circuit. As the majority agrees, a cross-petition is\nnecessary only when a respondent seeks to \u201calter\u201d the judgment below.\nAnte, at 5; see E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E.\nHartnett, Supreme Court Practice 490 (9th ed. 2007) (\u201c[A] party satis\u00ad\nfied with the action of a lower court should not have to appeal from it in\norder to defend a judgment in his or her favor on any ground\u201d). Here,\nthe Third Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Sym\u00ad\nczyk\u2019s FLSA suit, ruling that her collective action could go forward\neven though her individual claim was moot; accordingly, accepting\nSymczyk\u2019s new argument would lead not to modifying the appellate\njudgment, but to affirming it on a different ground. In any event, we\nhave never held that the cross-petition requirement is jurisdictional.\nSee id., at 493\u2013494. We can choose to excuse the absence of a cross\u00ad\npetition for the same reasons, discussed next, that we can consider an\nissue not raised below. See Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258\u2013259,\nn. 5 (1980).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   But as this Court noted in a similar case, \u201cassum[ing]\nwhat the facts will show to be ridiculous\u201d about a predi\u00ad\ncate question\u2014just because a party did not think to chal\u00ad\nlenge settled Circuit precedent\u2014runs \u201ca risk that ought\nto be avoided.\u201d Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger\nCorporation, 513 U. S. 374, 382 (1995). The question\nSymczyk now raises (\u201cDid an unaccepted settlement offer\nmoot my individual FLSA claim?\u201d) is logically prior to\u2014\nand thus inextricably intertwined with\u2014the question the\nmajority rushes to resolve (\u201cIf an unaccepted settlement\noffer mooted Symczyk\u2019s individual FLSA claim, could a\ncourt proceed to consider her proposed collective action?\u201d).\nIndeed, the former is so much part and parcel of the latter\nthat the question Genesis presented for our review\u2014\nand on which we granted certiorari\u2014actually looks more\nlike Symczyk\u2019s than like the majority\u2019s. Genesis asked:\n\u201cWhether a case becomes moot . . . when the lone plaintiff\nreceives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the\nplaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Symczyk, of course,\nwould respond \u201cno,\u201d because merely receiving an offer does\nnot moot any claim. The majority\u2019s refusal to consider\nthat obviously correct answer impedes \u201cintelligent resolu\u00ad\ntion of the question presented.\u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519\nU. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). By\ntaking a fallacy as its premise, the majority ensures it will\nreach the wrong decision.\n   Still, you might think, the majority\u2019s approach has at\nleast this benefit: In a future FLSA case, when an individ\u00ad\nual claim for damages in fact becomes moot, a court will\nknow what to do with the collective allegations. But no,\neven that much cannot be said for the majority\u2019s opinion.\nThat is because the individual claims in such cases will\nnever become moot, and a court will therefore never need\nto reach the issue the majority resolves. The majority\u2019s\ndecision is fit for nothing: Aside from getting this case\nwrong, it serves only to address a make-believe problem.\n6         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   To see why, consider how a collective FLSA action seek\u00ad\ning damages unfolds. A plaintiff (just like Symczyk, but\nlet us now call her Smith, to highlight her typicality) sues\nunder \u00a7216(b) on behalf of both herself and others. To\ndetermine whether Smith can serve as a representative\nparty, the court considers whether the workplace policy\nher suit challenges has similarly affected other employees.\nIf it has, the court supervises their discovery and notifica\u00ad\ntion, and then \u201coversee[s] the joinder\u201d of any who want\nSmith to represent them. Hoffman La-Roche Inc. v. Sper-\nling, 493 U. S. 165, 171 (1989). During that period, as\nthe majority observes, the class has no \u201cindependent legal\nstatus.\u201d Ante, at 7. At the same time, Smith\u2019s own claim\nis in perfect health. Because it is a damages claim for past\nconduct, the employer cannot extinguish it by adopting\nnew employment practices. Indeed, the claim would sur\u00ad\nvive even Smith\u2019s own demise, belonging then to her es\u00ad\ntate. Smith\u2019s individual claim, in short, is not going away\non its own; it can easily wait out the time involved in\nassembling a collective action. Accord, ante, at 9 (\u201c[A]\nclaim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live\nuntil it is settled [or] judicially resolved\u201d).\n   Now introduce a settlement offer into the picture: As\u00ad\nsume that before the court finally decides whether to\npermit a collective action, the defendant proposes to pay\nSmith the value of her individual claim in exchange for\nher abandonment of the entire litigation. If Smith agrees,\nof course, all is over; like any plaintiff, she can assent to\na settlement ending her suit. But assuming Smith does\nnot agree, because she wishes to proceed on behalf of other\nemployees, could the offer ever succeed in mooting her\ncase? I have already shown that it cannot do so in the\ncircumstances here, where the defendant makes an offer,\nthe plaintiff declines it, and nothing else occurs: On those\nfacts, Smith\u2019s claim is as it ever was, and the lawsuit\ncontinues onward. But suppose the defendant addition\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nally requests that the court enter judgment in Smith\u2019s\nfavor\u2014though over her objection\u2014for the amount offered\nto satisfy her individual claim. Could a court approve that\nmotion and then declare the case over on the ground that\nSmith has no further stake in it? That course would be\nless preposterous than what the court did here; at least\nSmith, unlike Symczyk, would get some money. But it\nwould be impermissible as well.\n    For starters, Rule 68 precludes a court from imposing\njudgment for a plaintiff like Smith based on an unaccepted\nsettlement offer made pursuant to its terms. The text of\nthe Rule contemplates that a court will enter judgment\nonly when a plaintiff accepts an offer. See Rule 68(a) (\u201cIf\n. . . the [plaintiff] serves written notice accepting the of-\nfer, either party may then file the offer and notice of ac\u00ad\nceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter\njudgment\u201d). And the Rule prohibits a court from consider\u00ad\ning an unaccepted offer for any purpose other than allocat\u00ad\ning litigation costs\u2014including for the purpose of entering\njudgment for either party. See Rule 68(b) (\u201cEvidence of an\nunaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding\nto determine costs\u201d). That injunction accords with Rule\n68\u2019s exclusive purpose: to promote voluntary cessation of\nlitigation by imposing costs on plaintiffs who spurn certain\nsettlement offers. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 5\n(1985). The Rule provides no appropriate mechanism for\na court to terminate a lawsuit without the plaintiff\u2019s\nconsent.\n    Nor does a court have inherent authority to enter an\nunwanted judgment for Smith on her individual claim, in\nservice of wiping out her proposed collective action. To be\nsure, a court has discretion to halt a lawsuit by entering\njudgment for the plaintiff when the defendant uncondi\u00ad\ntionally surrenders and only the plaintiff\u2019s obstinacy or\nmadness prevents her from accepting total victory. But\nthe court may not take that tack when the supposed ca\u00ad\n8           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\npitulation in fact fails to give the plaintiff all the law\nauthorizes and she has sought. And a judgment satisfying\nan individual claim does not give a plaintiff like Smith,\nexercising her right to sue on behalf of other employees,\n\u201call that [she] has . . . requested in the complaint (i.e.,\nrelief for the class).\u201d Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper,\n445 U. S. 326, 341 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).\nNo more in a collective action brought under the FLSA\nthan in any other class action may a court, prior to certifi\u00ad\ncation, eliminate the entire suit by acceding to a defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s proposal to make only the named plaintiff whole.\nThat course would short-circuit a collective action before it\ncould begin, and thereby frustrate Congress\u2019s decision to give\nFLSA plaintiffs \u201cthe opportunity to proceed collectively.\u201d\nHoffman La-Roche, 493 U. S., at 170; see Roper, 445\nU. S., at 339. It is our plaintiff Smith\u2019s choice, and not the\ndefendant\u2019s or the court\u2019s, whether satisfaction of her\nindividual claim, without redress of her viable classwide\nallegations, is sufficient to bring the lawsuit to an end.\n  And so, the question the majority answers should never\narise\u2014which means the analysis the majority propounds\nshould never apply.2 The majority assumes that an indi\u00ad\nvidual claim has become moot, and then asks whether\ncollective allegations can still proceed by virtue of the\nrelation-back doctrine. But that doctrine comes into play\nonly when a court confronts a jurisdictional gap\u2014an indi\u00ad\nvidual claim becoming moot before the court can certify a\nrepresentative action. And in an FLSA case for damages,\nthat gap cannot occur (unless a court, as here, mistakenly\ncreates it): As I have explained, the plaintiff\u2019s individual\nclaim remains live all the way through the court\u2019s decision\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 For\n        similarly questionable deployment of this Court\u2019s adjudicatory\nauthority, see Comcast Corp. v.

Without\nany gap to span, the relation-back doctrine has no rele\u00ad\nvance. Neither, then, does the majority\u2019s decision.3\n   The Court could have resolved this case (along with a\nCircuit split, see ante, at 5, and n. 3) by correcting the\nThird Circuit\u2019s view that an unaccepted settlement offer\nmooted Symczyk\u2019s individual claim. Instead, the Court\nchose to address an issue predicated on that misconcep\u00ad\ntion, in a way that aids no one, now or ever. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 And  that is a good thing, because (just as a by-the-by) the majority\u2019s\nopinion also misconceives our decisions applying the relation-back\ndoctrine. The majority painstakingly distinguishes those decisions on\ntheir individual facts, but misses their common take-away. In each, we\nconfronted a situation where a would-be class representative\u2019s individ\u00ad\nual claim became moot before a court could make a final decision about\nthe propriety of class litigation; and in each, we used relation-back\nprinciples to preserve the court\u2019s ability to adjudicate on the merits\nthe classwide questions the representative raised. See, e.g., County of\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 51\u201352 (1991); Swisher v. Brady,\n438 U. S. 204, 213\u2013214, n. 11 (1978); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.

If, counter-factually, Symczyk\u2019s individual claim\nbecame moot when she failed to accept Genesis\u2019s offer of judgment, her\ncase would fit comfortably alongside those precedents. Because the\nDistrict Court would not then have had \u201cenough time to rule on a\nmotion\u201d for certification under \u00a7216(b), \u201cthe \u2018relation back\u2019 doctrine\n[would be] properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for\njudicial resolution.\u201d McLaughlin, 500 U.

Argued December 3, 2012\u2014Decided April 16, 2013\nRespondent brought a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards\n  Act of 1938 (FLSA) on behalf of herself and \u201cother employees similar-\n  ly situated.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b). After she ignored petitioners\u2019 offer\n  of judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68, the District\n  Court, finding that no other individuals had joined her suit and that\n  the Rule 68 offer fully satisfied her claim, concluded that respond-\n  ent\u2019s suit was moot and dismissed it for lack of subject-matter juris-\n  diction. The Third Circuit reversed. It held that respondent\u2019s indi-\n  vidual claim was moot but that her collective action was not,\n  explaining that allowing defendants to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs be-\n  fore certification with calculated Rule 68 offers would frustrate the\n  goals of collective actions. The case was remanded to the District\n  Court to allow respondent to seek \u201cconditional certification,\u201d which, if\n  successful, would relate back to the date of her complaint.\nHeld: Because respondent had no personal interest in representing pu-\n tative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that\n would preserve her suit from mootness, her suit was appropriately\n dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an unaccepted\n Rule 68 offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff\u2019s individual claim is suffi-\n cient to render that claim moot, respondent conceded the issue below\n and did not properly raise it here. Thus, this Court assumes, without\n deciding, that petitioners\u2019 offer mooted her individual claim. Pp. 3\u20135.\n    (b) Well-settled mootness principles control the outcome of this\n case. After respondent\u2019s individual claim became moot, the suit be-\n came moot because she had no personal interest in representing oth-\n ers in the action.

Pp. 5\u201311.\n         (1) Neither Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, nor United States Pa-\n    role Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, support respondent\u2019s posi-\n    tion. Geraghty extended the principles of Sosna\u2014which held that a\n    class action is not rendered moot when the named plaintiff\u2019s individ-\n    ual claim becomes moot after the class has been duly certified\u2014to\n    denials of class certification motions; and it provided that, where an\n    action would have acquired independent legal status but for the dis-\n    trict court\u2019s erroneous denial of class certification, a corrected ruling\n    on appeal \u201crelates back\u201d to the time of the erroneous denial. 445\n    U. S., at 404, and n. 11. However, Geraghty\u2019s holding was explicitly\n    limited to cases in which the named plaintiff \u2019s claim remains live at\n    the time the district court denies class certification. See id., at 407,\n    n. 11. Here, respondent had not yet moved for \u201cconditional certifica-\n    tion\u201d when her claim became moot, nor had the District Court antici-\n    patorily ruled on any such request. She thus has no certification de-\n    cision to which her claim could have related back.                  More\n    fundamentally, essential to Sosna and Geraghty was the fact that a\n    putative class acquires an independent legal status once it is certified\n    under Rule 23. By contrast, under the FLSA, \u201cconditional certifica-\n    tion\u201d does not produce a class with an independent legal status, or\n    join additional parties to the action. Pp. 7\u20138.\n         (2) A line of cases holding that an \u201cinherently transitory\u201d class-\n    action claim is not necessarily moot upon the termination of the\n    named plaintiff\u2019s claim, see, e.g., County of Riverside v. McLaughlin,\n    500 U. S. 44, 52, is similarly inapplicable. Respondent argues that a\n    defendant\u2019s use of Rule 68 offers to \u201cpick off\u201d a named plaintiff before\n    the collective-action process is complete renders the action \u201cinherent-\n    ly transitory.\u201d But this rationale was developed to address circum-\n    stances in which the challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable\n    because no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit long\n    enough for litigation to run its course, and it has invariably focused\n    on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the\n    claim, not on the defendant\u2019s litigation strategy. Unlike a claim for\n    injunctive relief, a damages claim cannot evade review, nor can an of-\n    fer of full settlement insulate such a claim from review. Putative\n    plaintiffs may be foreclosed from vindicating their rights in respond-\n    ent\u2019s suit, but they remain free to do so in their own suits.

S. 326,\n    does not support respondent\u2019s claim that the purposes served by the\n    FLSA\u2019s collective-action provisions would be frustrated by defend-\n    ants\u2019 use of Rule 68 to \u201cpick off\u201d named plaintiffs before the collective-\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

In Roper, where the named plain-\n  tiffs\u2019 individual claims became moot after the District Court denied\n  their Rule 23 class certification motion and entered judgment in their\n  favor based on defendant\u2019s offer of judgment, this Court found that\n  the named plaintiffs could appeal the denial of certification because\n  they possessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the substan-\n  tive controversy, namely, to shift a portion of attorney\u2019s fees and ex-\n  penses to successful class litigants. Here, respondent conceded that\n  petitioners\u2019 offer provided complete relief, and she asserted no con-\n  tinuing economic interest in shifting attorney\u2019s fees and costs.

We granted certiorari to resolve whether such\na case is justiciable when the lone plaintiff \u2019s individual\nclaim becomes moot. 567 U. S. ___ (2012). We hold that it\nis not justiciable.\n                             I\n   The FLSA establishes federal minimum-wage, maximum-\nhour, and overtime guarantees that cannot be modified\nby contract. Section 16(b) of the FLSA, 52 Stat. 1060, as\namended, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), gives employees the right\nto bring a private cause of action on their own behalf and\non behalf of \u201cother employees similarly situated\u201d for speci-\nfied violations of the FLSA. A suit brought on behalf of\nother employees is known as a \u201ccollective action.\u201d See\nHoffmann-La Roche Inc. v. Sperling, 493 U. S. 165, 169\u2013\n170 (1989).\n   In 2009, respondent, who was formerly employed by\n2         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npetitioners as a registered nurse at Pennypack Center in\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a complaint on behalf of\nherself and \u201call other persons similarly situated.\u201d App.\n115\u2013116. Respondent alleged that petitioners violated the\nFLSA by automatically deducting 30 minutes of time\nworked per shift for meal breaks for certain employees,\neven when the employees performed compensable work\nduring those breaks. Respondent, who remained the sole\nplaintiff throughout these proceedings, sought statutory\ndamages for the alleged violations.\n   When petitioners answered the complaint, they simul-\ntaneously served upon respondent an offer of judgment\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. The offer in-\ncluded $7,500 for alleged unpaid wages, in addition to\n\u201csuch reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses . . .\nas the Court may determine.\u201d Id., at 77. Petition-\ners stipulated that if respondent did not accept the offer\nwithin 10 days after service, the offer would be deemed\nwithdrawn.\n   After respondent failed to respond in the allotted time\nperiod, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioners argued that be-\ncause they offered respondent complete relief on her indi-\nvidual damages claim, she no longer possessed a personal\nstake in the outcome of the suit, rendering the action\nmoot. Respondent objected, arguing that petitioners were\ninappropriately attempting to \u201cpick off \u201d the named plain-\ntiff before the collective-action process could unfold. Id., at\n91.\n   The District Court found that it was undisputed that no\nother individuals had joined respondent\u2019s suit and that the\nRule 68 offer of judgment fully satisfied her individual\nclaim. It concluded that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer of judg-\nment mooted respondent\u2019s suit, which it dismissed for lack\nof subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   The Court of Appeals reversed. 656 F. 3d 189 (CA3\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

The court agreed that no other potential plaintiff\nhad opted into the suit, that petitioners\u2019 offer fully satis-\nfied respondent\u2019s individual claim, and that, under its\nprecedents, whether or not such an offer is accepted, it\ngenerally moots a plaintiff \u2019s claim. Id., at 195. But the\ncourt nevertheless held that respondent\u2019s collective action\nwas not moot. It explained that calculated attempts by\nsome defendants to \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs with stra-\ntegic Rule 68 offers before certification could short circuit\nthe process, and, thereby, frustrate the goals of collective\nactions. Id., at 196\u2013198. The court determined that the\ncase must be remanded in order to allow respondent to\nseek \u201cconditional certification\u201d1 in the District Court. If\nrespondent were successful, the District Court was to\nrelate the certification motion back to the date on which\nrespondent filed her complaint.2 Ibid.\n                              II\n  Article III, \u00a72, of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction\nof federal courts to \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies,\u201d which\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Lower   courts have borrowed class-action terminology to describe the\nprocess of joining co-plaintiffs under 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b). While we do\nnot express an opinion on the propriety of this use of class-action\nnomenclature, we do note that there are significant differences between\ncertification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the joinder\nprocess under \u00a7216(b).\n   2 The \u201crelation back\u201d doctrine was developed in the context of class\n\nactions under Rule 23 to address the circumstance in which a named\nplaintiff\u2019s claim becomes moot prior to certification of the class. This\ncase raises two circumstances in which the Court has applied this\ndoctrine. First, where a named plaintiff\u2019s claim is \u201cinherently transi-\ntory,\u201d and becomes moot prior to certification, a motion for certification\nmay \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint. See, e.g., County of\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 51\u201352 (1991). Second, we have\nheld that where a certification motion is denied and a named plaintiff\u2019s\nclaim subsequently becomes moot, an appellate reversal of the certifica-\ntion decision may relate back to the time of the denial. See United\nStates Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 404 (1980).\n4         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v.

This requirement ensures that the Federal\nJudiciary confines itself to its constitutionally limited role\nof adjudicating actual and concrete disputes, the resolu-\ntions of which have direct consequences on the parties\ninvolved.\n   A corollary to this case-or-controversy requirement is\nthat \u201c \u2018an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of\nreview, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\u2019 \u201d\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 67\n(1997) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401\n(1975)). If an intervening circumstance deprives the\nplaintiff of a \u201cpersonal stake in the outcome of the law-\nsuit,\u201d at any point during litigation, the action can no\nlonger proceed and must be dismissed as moot. Lewis v.\nContinental Bank Corp., 494 U. S. 472, 477\u2013478 (1990)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In the proceedings below, both courts concluded that\npetitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer afforded respondent complete\nrelief on\u2014and thus mooted\u2014her FLSA claim.

The United States, as amicus curiae, similarly\nurges the Court to hold that petitioners\u2019 unaccepted offer\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

Brief for United States 10\u201315.\n  While the Courts of Appeals disagree whether an un-\naccepted offer that fully satisfies a plaintiff \u2019s claim is\nsufficient to render the claim moot,3 we do not reach this\nquestion, or resolve the split, because the issue is not\nproperly before us. The Third Circuit clearly held in this\ncase that respondent\u2019s individual claim was moot. 656\nF. 3d, at 201. Acceptance of respondent\u2019s argument to the\ncontrary now would alter the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment,\nwhich is impermissible in the absence of a cross-petition\nfrom respondent. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of\nKent, 510 U. S. 355, 364 (1994); Trans World Airlines, Inc.\nv. Thurston, 469 U. S. 111, 119, n. 14 (1985). Moreover,\neven if the cross-petition rule did not apply, respondent\u2019s\nwaiver of the issue would still prevent us from reaching it.\nIn the District Court, respondent conceded that \u201c[a]n offer\nof complete relief will generally moot the [plaintiff \u2019s]\nclaim, as at that point the plaintiff retains no personal\ninterest in the outcome of the litigation.\u201d App. 93; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2038676</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4. Respondent made a similar conces-\nsion in her brief to the Court of Appeals, see App. 193, and\nfailed to raise the argument in her brief in opposition to\nthe petition for certiorari. We, therefore, assume, without\ndeciding, that petitioners\u2019 Rule 68 offer mooted respond-\nent\u2019s individual claim. See Baldwin v. Reese, 541 U. S. 27,\n34 (2004).\n                            III\n   We turn, then, to the question whether respondent\u2019s\naction remained justiciable based on the collective-action\nallegations in her complaint. A straightforward applica-\ntion of well-settled mootness principles compels our an-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Compare, e.g., Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3\n\n2004), with McCauley v. Trans Union, LLC, 402 F. 3d 340, 342 (CA2\n2005).\n6           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nswer. In the absence of any claimant\u2019s opting in, respond-\nent\u2019s suit became moot when her individual claim became\nmoot, because she lacked any personal interest in repre-\nsenting others in this action. While the FLSA authorizes\nan aggrieved employee to bring an action on behalf of\nhimself and \u201cother employees similarly situated,\u201d 29\nU. S. C. \u00a7216(b), the mere presence of collective-action\nallegations in the complaint cannot save the suit from\nmootness once the individual claim is satisfied.4 In order\nto avoid this outcome, respondent relies almost entirely\nupon cases that arose in the context of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23 class actions, particularly United\nStates Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388 (1980);\nDeposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326\n(1980); and Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393 (1975). But these\ncases are inapposite, both because Rule 23 actions are\nfundamentally different from collective actions under the\nFLSA, see Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 493 U. S., at 177\u2013178\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting), and because these cases are, by\ntheir own terms, inapplicable to these facts. It follows\nthat this action was appropriately dismissed as moot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 While we do not resolve the question whether a Rule 68 offer that\n\nfully satisfies the plaintiff\u2019s claims is sufficient by itself to moot the\naction, supra, at 5, we note that Courts of Appeals on both sides of that\nissue have recognized that a plaintiff\u2019s claim may be satisfied even\nwithout the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Some courts maintain that an unac-\ncepted offer of complete relief alone is sufficient to moot the individual\u2019s\nclaim. E.g., Weiss, supra, at 340; Greisz v. Household Bank (Ill.), N. A.,\n176 F. 3d 1012, 1015 (CA7 1999). Other courts have held that, in the\nface of an unaccepted offer of complete relief, district courts may \u201center\njudgment in favor of the plaintiffs in accordance with the defendants\u2019\nRule 68 offer of judgment.\u201d O\u2019Brien v. Ed Donnelly Enters., Inc., 575\nF. 3d 567, 575 (CA6 2009); see also McCauley v. Trans Union, LLC, 402\nF. 3d 340, 342 (CA2 2005). Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, see post,\nat 8 (opinion of Kagan, J.), nothing in the nature of FLSA actions\nprecludes satisfaction\u2014and thus the mooting\u2014of the individual\u2019s claim\nbefore the collective-action component of the suit has run its course.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               A\n\n   Respondent contends that she has a sufficient personal\nstake in this case based on a statutorily created collective-\naction interest in representing other similarly situated\nemployees under \u00a7216(b). Brief for Respondent 47\u201348. In\nsupport of her argument, respondent cites our decision in\nGeraghty, which in turn has its roots in Sosna. Neither\ncase supports her position.\n   In Sosna, the Court held that a class action is not ren-\ndered moot when the named plaintiff \u2019s individual claim\nbecomes moot after the class has been duly certified. 419\nU. S., at 399. The Court reasoned that when a district\ncourt certifies a class, \u201cthe class of unnamed persons\ndescribed in the certification acquire[s] a legal status\nseparate from the interest asserted by [the named plain-\ntiff],\u201d with the result that a live controversy may continue\nto exist, even after the claim of the named plaintiff be-\ncomes moot. Id., at 399\u2013402. Geraghty narrowly extended\nthis principle to denials of class certification motions. The\nCourt held that where an action would have acquired the\nindependent legal status described in Sosna but for the\ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous denial of class certification, a\ncorrected ruling on appeal \u201crelates back\u201d to the time of the\nerroneous denial of the certification motion. 445 U. S., at\n404, and n. 11.\n   Geraghty is inapposite, because the Court explicitly\nlimited its holding to cases in which the named plaintiff \u2019s\nclaim remains live at the time the district court denies\nclass certification. See id., at 407, n. 11. Here, respondent\nhad not yet moved for \u201cconditional certification\u201d when her\nclaim became moot, nor had the District Court anticipa-\ntorily ruled on any such request. Her claim instead became\nmoot prior to these events, foreclosing any recourse to\nGeraghty. There is simply no certification decision to\nwhich respondent\u2019s claim could have related back.\n   More fundamentally, essential to our decisions in Sosna\n8         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand Geraghty was the fact that a putative class acquires\nan independent legal status once it is certified under Rule\n23. Under the FLSA, by contrast, \u201cconditional certifica-\ntion\u201d does not produce a class with an independent legal\nstatus, or join additional parties to the action. The sole\nconsequence of conditional certification is the sending of\ncourt-approved written notice to employees, see Hoffmann-\nLa Roche Inc., supra, at 171\u2013172, who in turn become\nparties to a collective action only by filing written con-\nsent with the court, \u00a7216(b). So even if respondent were\nto secure a conditional certification ruling on remand,\nnothing in that ruling would preserve her suit from\nmootness.\n                                B\n   Respondent also advances an argument based on a\nseparate, but related, line of cases in which the Court held\nthat an \u201cinherently transitory\u201d class-action claim is not\nnecessarily moot upon the termination of the named plain-\ntiff \u2019s claim. Like our decision in Geraghty, this line of\ncases began with Sosna and is similarly inapplicable here.\n   After concluding that the expiration of a named plain-\ntiff \u2019s claim following certification does not moot the class\naction, Sosna suggested that, where a named plaintiff\u2019s\nindividual claim becomes moot before the district court\nhas an opportunity to rule on the certification motion, and\nthe issue would otherwise evade review, the certification\nmight \u201crelate back\u201d to the filing of the complaint. 419\nU. S., at 402, n. 11. The Court has since held that the\nrelation-back doctrine may apply in Rule 23 cases where it\nis \u201ccertain that other persons similarly situated\u201d will\ncontinue to be subject to the challenged conduct and the\nclaims raised are \u201c \u2018so inherently transitory that the trial\ncourt will not have even enough time to rule on a motion\nfor class certification before the proposed representative\u2019s\nindividual interest expires.\u2019 \u201d      County of Riverside v.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMcLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 52 (1991) (quoting Geraghty,\nsupra, at 399), in turn citing Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S.\n103, 110, n. 11 (1975)). Invoking this doctrine, respondent\nargues that defendants can strategically use Rule 68 offers\nto \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs before the collective-action\nprocess is complete, rendering collective actions \u201cinher-\nently transitory\u201d in effect. Brief for Respondent 37.\n   Our cases invoking the \u201cinherently transitory\u201d relation-\nback rationale do not apply. The \u201cinherently transitory\u201d\nrationale was developed to address circumstances in which\nthe challenged conduct was effectively unreviewable,\nbecause no plaintiff possessed a personal stake in the suit\nlong enough for litigation to run its course. A plaintiff\nmight seek, for instance, to bring a class action challeng-\ning the constitutionality of temporary pretrial detentions.\nIn doing so, the named plaintiff would face the considera-\nble challenge of preserving his individual claim from\nmootness, since pretrial custody likely would end prior to\nthe resolution of his claim. See Gerstein, supra. To ad-\ndress this problem, the Court explained that in cases\nwhere the transitory nature of the conduct giving rise to\nthe suit would effectively insulate defendants\u2019 conduct\nfrom review, certification could potentially \u201crelate back\u201d to\nthe filing of the complaint. Id., at 110, n. 11; McLaughlin,\nsupra, at 52. But this doctrine has invariably focused on\nthe fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to\nthe claim, not on the defendant\u2019s litigation strategy. See,\ne.g., Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204, 214, n. 11 (1978);\nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U. S. 1, 17\u201318 (1998).\n   In this case, respondent\u2019s complaint requested statutory\ndamages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging\nongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade re-\nview; it remains live until it is settled, judicially resolved,\nor barred by a statute of limitations. Nor can a defend-\nant\u2019s attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim\nfrom review, for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff \u2019s\n10         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nalleged harm by making the plaintiff whole. While set-\ntlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing un-\njoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in\nrespondent\u2019s suit, such putative plaintiffs remain free to\nvindicate their rights in their own suits. They are no less\nable to have their claims settled or adjudicated following\nrespondent\u2019s suit than if her suit had never been filed at\nall.\n                              C\n   Finally, respondent argues that the purposes served\nby the FLSA\u2019s collective-action provisions\u2014for example,\nefficient resolution of common claims and lower individual\ncosts associated with litigation\u2014would be frustrated by\ndefendants\u2019 use of Rule 68 to \u201cpick off \u201d named plaintiffs\nbefore the collective-action process has run its course.\nBoth respondent and the Court of Appeals purported to\nfind support for this position in our decision in Roper, 445\nU. S., at 339.\n   In Roper, the named plaintiffs\u2019 individual claims became\nmoot after the District Court denied their motion for class\ncertification under Rule 23 and subsequently entered\njudgment in their favor, based on the defendant bank\u2019s\noffer of judgment for the maximum recoverable amount of\ndamages, in addition to interest and court costs. Id., at\n329\u2013330. The Court held that even though the District\nCourt had entered judgment in the named plaintiffs\u2019 favor,\nthey could nevertheless appeal the denial of their motion\nto certify the class. The Court found that, under the par-\nticular circumstances of that case, the named plaintiffs\npossessed an ongoing, personal economic stake in the\nsubstantive controversy\u2014namely, to shift a portion of\nattorney\u2019s fees and expenses to successful class litigants.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Because Roper is distinguishable on the facts, we need not consider\n\nits continuing validity in light of our subsequent decision in Lewis v.\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

Only then, in dicta, did the\nCourt underscore the importance of a district court\u2019s class\ncertification decision and observe that allowing defendants\nto \u201c \u2018pic[k] off\u2019\u201d party plaintiffs before an affirmative ruling\nwas achieved \u201cwould frustrate the objectives of class ac-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 339.\n   Roper\u2019s holding turned on a specific factual finding that\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 possessed a continuing personal economic\nstake in the litigation, even after the defendants\u2019 offer of\njudgment. Id., at 336. As already explained, here, re-\nspondent conceded that petitioners\u2019 offer \u201cprovided com-\nplete relief on her individual claims,\u201d Brief in Opposition i,\nand she failed to assert any continuing economic interest\nin shifting attorney\u2019s fees and costs to others. Moreover,\nRoper\u2019s dictum was tethered to the unique significance of\ncertification decisions in class-action proceedings. 445\nU. S., at 339. Whatever significance \u201cconditional certifica-\ntion\u201d may have in \u00a7216(b) proceedings, it is not tanta-\nmount to class certification under Rule 23.\n                        *     *    *\n  The Court of Appeals concluded that respondent\u2019s indi-\nvidual claim became moot following petitioners\u2019 Rule 68\noffer of judgment. We have assumed, without deciding,\nthat this is correct.\n  Reaching the question on which we granted certiorari,\nwe conclude that respondent has no personal interest in\nrepresenting putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other\ncontinuing interest that would preserve her suit from\nmootness.

The issue here, the majority tells us, is\nwhether a \u201c \u2018 collective action\u2019 \u201d brought under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7201\net seq., \u201cis justiciable when the lone plaintiff\u2019s individual\nclaim becomes moot.\u201d Ante, at 1. Embedded within that\nquestion is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has\nbecome moot, as the lower courts held and the majority\nassumes without deciding. But what if that premise is\nbogus? What if the plaintiff\u2019s individual claim here never\nbecame moot? And what if, in addition, no similar claim\nfor damages will ever become moot? In that event, the\nmajority\u2019s decision\u2014founded as it is on an unfounded\nassumption\u2014would have no real-world meaning or appli\u00ad\ncation. The decision would turn out to be the most one-off\nof one-offs, explaining only what (the majority thinks)\nshould happen to a proposed collective FLSA action when\nsomething that in fact never happens to an individual\nFLSA claim is errantly thought to have done so. That is\nthe case here, for reasons I\u2019ll describe. Feel free to rele\u00ad\ngate the majority\u2019s decision to the furthest reaches of your\n2         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nmind: The situation it addresses should never again arise.\n   Consider the facts of this case, keeping an eye out for\nanything that would render any part of it moot. Respond\u00ad\nent Laura Symczyk brought suit under a provision of the\nFLSA, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), \u201con behalf of herself and others\nsimilarly situated.\u201d App. 21. Her complaint alleged\nthat her former employer, petitioner Genesis Healthcare\nCorporation (Genesis), violated the FLSA by treating\n30 minutes of every shift as an unpaid meal break, even\nwhen an employee worked during that time. Genesis\nanswered the complaint and simultaneously made an offer\nof judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68.\nThat settlement proposal covered only Symczyk\u2019s individ\u00ad\nual claim, to the tune of $7,500 in lost wages. The offer,\naccording to its terms, would \u201cbe deemed withdrawn\u201d if\nSymczyk did not accept it within 10 days. App. 79. That\ndeadline came and went without any reply. The case then\nproceeded in the normal fashion, with the District Court\nsetting a schedule for discovery. Pause here for a moment\nto ask whether you\u2019ve seen anything yet that would moot\nSymczyk\u2019s individual claim. No? Neither have I.\n   Nevertheless, Genesis moved to dismiss Symczyk\u2019s suit\non the ground that it was moot. The supposed logic went\nlike this: We (i.e., Genesis) offered Symczyk complete relief\non her individual damages claim; she \u201ceffectively reject[ed]\nthe [o]ffer\u201d by failing to respond; because she did so, she\n\u201cno longer has a personal stake or legally cognizable inter\u00ad\nest in the outcome of this action\u201d; accordingly, the court\n\u201cshould dismiss her claims.\u201d Id., at 67. Relying on Circuit\nprecedent, the District Court agreed; it dismissed the case\nfor lack of jurisdiction\u2014without awarding Symczyk any\ndamages or other relief\u2014based solely on the unaccepted\noffer Genesis had made. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 35\n(citing Weiss v. Regal Collections, 385 F. 3d 337, 340 (CA3\n2004)). And finally, the Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit concurred that Genesis\u2019s offer mooted Symczyk\u2019s\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nindividual claim (though also holding that she could still\nproceed with a collective action). See 656 F. 3d 189 (2011).\n   That thrice-asserted view is wrong, wrong, and wrong\nagain. We made clear earlier this Term that \u201c[a]s long as\nthe parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the\noutcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d Chafin v.\nChafin, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] case becomes moot only\nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). By those measures, an unac\u00ad\ncepted offer of judgment cannot moot a case. When a\nplaintiff rejects such an offer\u2014however good the terms\u2014\nher interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was be\u00ad\nfore. And so too does the court\u2019s ability to grant her relief.\nAn unaccepted settlement offer\u2014like any unaccepted\ncontract offer\u2014is a legal nullity, with no operative effect.\nAs every first-year law student learns, the recipient\u2019s re-\njection of an offer \u201cleaves the matter as if no offer had\never been made.\u201d Minneapolis & St. Louis R.

Nothing\nin Rule 68 alters that basic principle; to the contrary, that\nrule specifies that \u201c[a]n unaccepted offer is considered\nwithdrawn.\u201d Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68(b). So assuming the\ncase was live before\u2014because the plaintiff had a stake and\nthe court could grant relief\u2014the litigation carries on,\nunmooted.\n   For this reason, Symczyk\u2019s individual claim was alive\nand well when the District Court dismissed her suit.\nRecall: Genesis made a settlement offer under Rule 68;\nSymczyk decided not to accept it; after 10 days, it expired\nand the suit went forward. Symczyk\u2019s individual stake in\nthe lawsuit thus remained what it had always been, and\nditto the court\u2019s capacity to grant her relief. After the\noffer lapsed, just as before, Symczyk possessed an unsatis\u00ad\nfied claim, which the court could redress by awarding her\n4           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\ndamages. As long as that remained true, Symczyk\u2019s claim\nwas not moot, and the District Court could not send her\naway empty-handed. So a friendly suggestion to the Third\nCircuit: Rethink your mootness-by-unaccepted-offer theo\u00ad\nry. And a note to all other courts of appeals: Don\u2019t try this\nat home.\n   To this point, what I have said conflicts with nothing in\nthe Court\u2019s opinion. The majority does not attempt to\nargue, \u00e0 la the Third Circuit, that the unaccepted settle\u00ad\nment offer mooted Symczyk\u2019s individual damages claim.\nInstead, the majority hangs its hat on a finding of waiver.\nSee ante, at 5, 11. The majority notes\u2014correctly\u2014that\nSymczyk accepted the Third Circuit\u2019s rule in her briefs\nbelow, and also failed to challenge it in her brief in opposi\u00ad\ntion to the petition for certiorari; she contested it first in\nher merits brief before this Court. That enables the ma\u00ad\njority to \u201cassume, without deciding,\u201d the mootness of\nSymczyk\u2019s individual claim and reach the oh-so-much\u00ad\nmore-interesting question relating to her proposed collec\u00ad\ntive action. Ante, at 5.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The majority also justifies this approach on the ground that\n\nSymczyk did not file a cross-petition for certiorari objecting to the Third\nCircuit\u2019s decision. But that is because Symczyk got the judgment she\nwanted in the Third Circuit. As the majority agrees, a cross-petition is\nnecessary only when a respondent seeks to \u201calter\u201d the judgment below.\nAnte, at 5; see E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E.\nHartnett, Supreme Court Practice 490 (9th ed. 2007) (\u201c[A] party satis\u00ad\nfied with the action of a lower court should not have to appeal from it in\norder to defend a judgment in his or her favor on any ground\u201d). Here,\nthe Third Circuit reversed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Sym\u00ad\nczyk\u2019s FLSA suit, ruling that her collective action could go forward\neven though her individual claim was moot; accordingly, accepting\nSymczyk\u2019s new argument would lead not to modifying the appellate\njudgment, but to affirming it on a different ground. In any event, we\nhave never held that the cross-petition requirement is jurisdictional.\nSee id., at 493\u2013494. We can choose to excuse the absence of a cross\u00ad\npetition for the same reasons, discussed next, that we can consider an\nissue not raised below. See Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258\u2013259,\nn. 5 (1980).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   But as this Court noted in a similar case, \u201cassum[ing]\nwhat the facts will show to be ridiculous\u201d about a predi\u00ad\ncate question\u2014just because a party did not think to chal\u00ad\nlenge settled Circuit precedent\u2014runs \u201ca risk that ought\nto be avoided.\u201d Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger\nCorporation, 513 U. S. 374, 382 (1995). The question\nSymczyk now raises (\u201cDid an unaccepted settlement offer\nmoot my individual FLSA claim?\u201d) is logically prior to\u2014\nand thus inextricably intertwined with\u2014the question the\nmajority rushes to resolve (\u201cIf an unaccepted settlement\noffer mooted Symczyk\u2019s individual FLSA claim, could a\ncourt proceed to consider her proposed collective action?\u201d).\nIndeed, the former is so much part and parcel of the latter\nthat the question Genesis presented for our review\u2014\nand on which we granted certiorari\u2014actually looks more\nlike Symczyk\u2019s than like the majority\u2019s. Genesis asked:\n\u201cWhether a case becomes moot . . . when the lone plaintiff\nreceives an offer from the defendants to satisfy all of the\nplaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. Symczyk, of course,\nwould respond \u201cno,\u201d because merely receiving an offer does\nnot moot any claim. The majority\u2019s refusal to consider\nthat obviously correct answer impedes \u201cintelligent resolu\u00ad\ntion of the question presented.\u201d Ohio v. Robinette, 519\nU. S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). By\ntaking a fallacy as its premise, the majority ensures it will\nreach the wrong decision.\n   Still, you might think, the majority\u2019s approach has at\nleast this benefit: In a future FLSA case, when an individ\u00ad\nual claim for damages in fact becomes moot, a court will\nknow what to do with the collective allegations. But no,\neven that much cannot be said for the majority\u2019s opinion.\nThat is because the individual claims in such cases will\nnever become moot, and a court will therefore never need\nto reach the issue the majority resolves. The majority\u2019s\ndecision is fit for nothing: Aside from getting this case\nwrong, it serves only to address a make-believe problem.\n6         GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   To see why, consider how a collective FLSA action seek\u00ad\ning damages unfolds. A plaintiff (just like Symczyk, but\nlet us now call her Smith, to highlight her typicality) sues\nunder \u00a7216(b) on behalf of both herself and others. To\ndetermine whether Smith can serve as a representative\nparty, the court considers whether the workplace policy\nher suit challenges has similarly affected other employees.\nIf it has, the court supervises their discovery and notifica\u00ad\ntion, and then \u201coversee[s] the joinder\u201d of any who want\nSmith to represent them. Hoffman La-Roche Inc. v. Sper-\nling, 493 U. S. 165, 171 (1989). During that period, as\nthe majority observes, the class has no \u201cindependent legal\nstatus.\u201d Ante, at 7. At the same time, Smith\u2019s own claim\nis in perfect health. Because it is a damages claim for past\nconduct, the employer cannot extinguish it by adopting\nnew employment practices. Indeed, the claim would sur\u00ad\nvive even Smith\u2019s own demise, belonging then to her es\u00ad\ntate. Smith\u2019s individual claim, in short, is not going away\non its own; it can easily wait out the time involved in\nassembling a collective action. Accord, ante, at 9 (\u201c[A]\nclaim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live\nuntil it is settled [or] judicially resolved\u201d).\n   Now introduce a settlement offer into the picture: As\u00ad\nsume that before the court finally decides whether to\npermit a collective action, the defendant proposes to pay\nSmith the value of her individual claim in exchange for\nher abandonment of the entire litigation. If Smith agrees,\nof course, all is over; like any plaintiff, she can assent to\na settlement ending her suit. But assuming Smith does\nnot agree, because she wishes to proceed on behalf of other\nemployees, could the offer ever succeed in mooting her\ncase? I have already shown that it cannot do so in the\ncircumstances here, where the defendant makes an offer,\nthe plaintiff declines it, and nothing else occurs: On those\nfacts, Smith\u2019s claim is as it ever was, and the lawsuit\ncontinues onward. But suppose the defendant addition\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nally requests that the court enter judgment in Smith\u2019s\nfavor\u2014though over her objection\u2014for the amount offered\nto satisfy her individual claim. Could a court approve that\nmotion and then declare the case over on the ground that\nSmith has no further stake in it? That course would be\nless preposterous than what the court did here; at least\nSmith, unlike Symczyk, would get some money. But it\nwould be impermissible as well.\n    For starters, Rule 68 precludes a court from imposing\njudgment for a plaintiff like Smith based on an unaccepted\nsettlement offer made pursuant to its terms. The text of\nthe Rule contemplates that a court will enter judgment\nonly when a plaintiff accepts an offer. See Rule 68(a) (\u201cIf\n. . . the [plaintiff] serves written notice accepting the of-\nfer, either party may then file the offer and notice of ac\u00ad\nceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter\njudgment\u201d). And the Rule prohibits a court from consider\u00ad\ning an unaccepted offer for any purpose other than allocat\u00ad\ning litigation costs\u2014including for the purpose of entering\njudgment for either party. See Rule 68(b) (\u201cEvidence of an\nunaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding\nto determine costs\u201d). That injunction accords with Rule\n68\u2019s exclusive purpose: to promote voluntary cessation of\nlitigation by imposing costs on plaintiffs who spurn certain\nsettlement offers. See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U. S. 1, 5\n(1985). The Rule provides no appropriate mechanism for\na court to terminate a lawsuit without the plaintiff\u2019s\nconsent.\n    Nor does a court have inherent authority to enter an\nunwanted judgment for Smith on her individual claim, in\nservice of wiping out her proposed collective action. To be\nsure, a court has discretion to halt a lawsuit by entering\njudgment for the plaintiff when the defendant uncondi\u00ad\ntionally surrenders and only the plaintiff\u2019s obstinacy or\nmadness prevents her from accepting total victory. But\nthe court may not take that tack when the supposed ca\u00ad\n8           GENESIS HEALTHCARE CORP. v. SYMCZYK\n\n                         KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\npitulation in fact fails to give the plaintiff all the law\nauthorizes and she has sought. And a judgment satisfying\nan individual claim does not give a plaintiff like Smith,\nexercising her right to sue on behalf of other employees,\n\u201call that [she] has . . . requested in the complaint (i.e.,\nrelief for the class).\u201d Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper,\n445 U. S. 326, 341 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).\nNo more in a collective action brought under the FLSA\nthan in any other class action may a court, prior to certifi\u00ad\ncation, eliminate the entire suit by acceding to a defend\u00ad\nant\u2019s proposal to make only the named plaintiff whole.\nThat course would short-circuit a collective action before it\ncould begin, and thereby frustrate Congress\u2019s decision to give\nFLSA plaintiffs \u201cthe opportunity to proceed collectively.\u201d\nHoffman La-Roche, 493 U. S., at 170; see Roper, 445\nU. S., at 339. It is our plaintiff Smith\u2019s choice, and not the\ndefendant\u2019s or the court\u2019s, whether satisfaction of her\nindividual claim, without redress of her viable classwide\nallegations, is sufficient to bring the lawsuit to an end.\n  And so, the question the majority answers should never\narise\u2014which means the analysis the majority propounds\nshould never apply.2 The majority assumes that an indi\u00ad\nvidual claim has become moot, and then asks whether\ncollective allegations can still proceed by virtue of the\nrelation-back doctrine. But that doctrine comes into play\nonly when a court confronts a jurisdictional gap\u2014an indi\u00ad\nvidual claim becoming moot before the court can certify a\nrepresentative action. And in an FLSA case for damages,\nthat gap cannot occur (unless a court, as here, mistakenly\ncreates it): As I have explained, the plaintiff\u2019s individual\nclaim remains live all the way through the court\u2019s decision\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 For\n        similarly questionable deployment of this Court\u2019s adjudicatory\nauthority, see Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (joint\nopinion of GINSBURG and BREYER, JJ.) (observing in dissent that \u201c[t]he\nCourt\u2019s ruling is good for this day and case only\u201d).\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     9\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwhether to join new plaintiffs to the litigation. Without\nany gap to span, the relation-back doctrine has no rele\u00ad\nvance. Neither, then, does the majority\u2019s decision.3\n   The Court could have resolved this case (along with a\nCircuit split, see ante, at 5, and n. 3) by correcting the\nThird Circuit\u2019s view that an unaccepted settlement offer\nmooted Symczyk\u2019s individual claim. Instead, the Court\nchose to address an issue predicated on that misconcep\u00ad\ntion, in a way that aids no one, now or ever. I respectfully\ndissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 And  that is a good thing, because (just as a by-the-by) the majority\u2019s\nopinion also misconceives our decisions applying the relation-back\ndoctrine. The majority painstakingly distinguishes those decisions on\ntheir individual facts, but misses their common take-away. In each, we\nconfronted a situation where a would-be class representative\u2019s individ\u00ad\nual claim became moot before a court could make a final decision about\nthe propriety of class litigation; and in each, we used relation-back\nprinciples to preserve the court\u2019s ability to adjudicate on the merits\nthe classwide questions the representative raised. See, e.g., County of\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 51\u201352 (1991); Swisher v. Brady,\n438 U. S. 204, 213\u2013214, n. 11 (1978); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103,\n110\u2013111, n. 11 (1975); see also United States Parole Comm\u2019n v.\nGeraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 399, 404, n. 11 (1980); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S.\n393, 402, n. 11 (1975). If, counter-factually, Symczyk\u2019s individual claim\nbecame moot when she failed to accept Genesis\u2019s offer of judgment, her\ncase would fit comfortably alongside those precedents. Because the\nDistrict Court would not then have had \u201cenough time to rule on a\nmotion\u201d for certification under \u00a7216(b), \u201cthe \u2018relation back\u2019 doctrine\n[would be] properly invoked to preserve the merits of the case for\njudicial resolution.\u201d McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 52 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n</pre>",
