MCNEELY\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI\n\n    No. 11–1425. Argued January 9, 2013—Decided April 17, 2013\nRespondent McNeely was stopped by a Missouri police officer for speed-\n  ing and crossing the centerline. After declining to take a breath test\n  to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC), he was arrested\n  and taken to a nearby hospital for blood testing. The officer never at-\n  tempted to secure a search warrant. McNeely refused to consent to\n  the blood test, but the officer directed a lab technician to take a sam-\n  ple. McNeely’s BAC tested well above the legal limit, and he was\n  charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He moved to suppress\n  the blood test result, arguing that taking his blood without a warrant\n  violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court agreed, con-\n  cluding that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did\n  not apply because, apart from the fact that McNeely’s blood alcohol\n  was dissipating, no circumstances suggested that the officer faced an\n  emergency.      The State Supreme Court affirmed, relying on\n  Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, in which this Court upheld a\n  DWI suspect’s warrantless blood test where the officer “might rea-\n  sonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in\n  which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circum-\n  stances, threatened ‘the destruction of evidence,’ ” id., at 770. This\n  case, the state court found, involved a routine DWI investigation\n  where no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood alcohol\n  suggested that there was an emergency, and, thus, the nonconsensu-\n  al warrantless test violated McNeely’s right to be free from unrea-\n  sonable searches of his person.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n358 S. W. 3d 65, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to Parts I, II–A, II–B, and IV, concluding that in drunk-driving inves-\n  tigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does\n2                        MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conduct-\n    ing a blood test without a warrant. Pp. 4–13, 20–23.\n       (a) The principle that a warrantless search of the person is reason-\n    able only if it falls within a recognized exception, see, e.g., United\n    States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224, applies here, where the search\n    involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath McNeely’s skin and\n    into his veins to obtain a blood sample to use as evidence in a crimi-\n    nal investigation. One recognized exception “applies when ‘ “the exi-\n    gencies of the situation” make the needs of law enforcement so com-\n    pelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable.’ ”\n    Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. This Court looks to the totality\n    of circumstances in determining whether an exigency exits. See\n    Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 406. Applying this approach\n    in Schmerber, the Court found a warrantless blood test reasonable af-\n    ter considering all of the facts and circumstances of that case and\n    carefully basing its holding on those specific facts, including that al-\n    cohol levels decline after drinking stops and that testing was delayed\n    while officers transported the injured suspect to the hospital and in-\n    vestigated the accident scene. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) The State nonetheless seeks a per se rule, contending that exi-\n    gent circumstances necessarily exist when an officer has probable\n    cause to believe a person has been driving under the influence of al-\n    cohol because BAC evidence is inherently evanescent. Though a per-\n    son’s blood alcohol level declines until the alcohol is eliminated, it\n    does not follow that the Court should depart from careful case-by-\n    case assessment of exigency. When officers in drunk-driving investi-\n    gations can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sam-\n    ple drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the\n    search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so. See\n    McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 456. Circumstances may\n    make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the alcohol’s dissipa-\n    tion will support an exigency, but that is a reason to decide each case\n    on its facts, as in Schmerber, not to accept the “considerable overgen-\n    eralization” that a per se rule would reflect, Richards v. Wisconsin,\n    520 U. S. 385, 393. Blood testing is different in critical respects from\n    other destruction-of-evidence cases. Unlike a situation where, e.g., a\n    suspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see Cupp v. Mur-\n    phy, 412 U. S. 291, 296, BAC evidence naturally dissipates in a grad-\n    ual and relatively predictable manner. Moreover, because an officer\n    must typically take a DWI suspect to a medical facility and obtain a\n    trained medical professional’s assistance before having a blood test\n    conducted, some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and\n    time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether a warrant is ob-\n    tained. The State’s rule also fails to account for advances in the 47\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  years since Schmerber was decided that allow for the more expedi-\n  tious processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like\n  drunk-driving investigations where the evidence supporting probable\n  cause is simple. The natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may\n  support an exigency finding in a specific case, as it did in Schmerber,\n  but it does not do so categorically. Pp. 8–13.\n     (c) Because the State sought a per se rule here, it did not argue that\n  there were exigent circumstances in this particular case. The argu-\n  ments and the record thus do not provide the Court with an adequate\n  framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that\n  can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of act-\n  ing without a warrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of\n  alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are\n  among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a\n  warrant is required. Pp. 20–23.\n     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\n  and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part III that other arguments ad-\n  vanced by the State and amici in support of a per se rule are unper-\n  suasive. Their concern that a case-by-case approach to exigency will\n  not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers may make\n  the desire for a bright-line rule understandable, but the Fourth\n  Amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical\n  approach in this context. A fact-intensive, totality of the circum-\n  stances, approach is hardly unique within this Court’s Fourth\n  Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S.\n  119, 123–125. They also contend that the privacy interest implicated\n  here is minimal. But motorists’ diminished expectation of privacy\n  does not diminish their privacy interest in preventing a government\n  agent from piercing their skin. And though a blood test conducted in\n  a medical setting by trained personnel is less intrusive than other\n  bodily invasions, this Court has never retreated from its recognition\n  that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates signifi-\n  cant, constitutionally protected privacy interests. Finally, the gov-\n  ernment’s general interest in combating drunk driving does not justi-\n  fy departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent\n  circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particu-\n  lar case.

California, 384 U. S. 757 (1966), this\nCourt upheld a warrantless blood test of an individual\narrested for driving under the influence of alcohol because\nthe officer “might reasonably have believed that he was\nconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay neces­\nsary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threat­\nened the destruction of evidence.” Id., at 770 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The question presented here\nis whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the\nbloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an\nexception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant require­\nment for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving\ncases. We conclude that it does not, and we hold, con­\nsistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that\nexigency in this context must be determined case by case\nbased on the totality of the circumstances.\n2                          MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n   While on highway patrol at approximately 2:08 a.m., a\nMissouri police officer stopped Tyler McNeely’s truck after\nobserving it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly\ncross the centerline. The officer noticed several signs\nthat McNeely was intoxicated, including McNeely’s blood­\nshot eyes, his slurred speech, and the smell of alcohol on his\nbreath. McNeely acknowledged to the officer that he had\nconsumed “a couple of beers” at a bar, App. 20, and he\nappeared unsteady on his feet when he exited the truck.\nAfter McNeely performed poorly on a battery of field­\nsobriety tests and declined to use a portable breath-test\ndevice to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC),\nthe officer placed him under arrest.\n   The officer began to transport McNeely to the station\nhouse. But when McNeely indicated that he would again\nrefuse to provide a breath sample, the officer changed\ncourse and took McNeely to a nearby hospital for blood\ntesting. The officer did not attempt to secure a warrant.\nUpon arrival at the hospital, the officer asked McNeely\nwhether he would consent to a blood test. Reading from\na standard implied consent form, the officer explained to\nMcNeely that under state law refusal to submit voluntar-\nily to the test would lead to the immediate revocation of his\ndriver’s license for one year and could be used against him\nin a future prosecution. See Mo. Ann. Stat. §§577.020.1,\n577.041 (West 2011). McNeely nonetheless refused. The\nofficer then directed a hospital lab technician to take a\nblood sample, and the sample was secured at approxi­\nmately 2:35 a.m. Subsequent laboratory testing measured\nMcNeely’s BAC at 0.154 percent, which was well above the\nlegal limit of 0.08 percent. See §577.012.1.\n   McNeely was charged with driving while intoxicated\n(DWI), in violation of §577.010.1 He moved to suppress\n——————\n    1 As   a result of his two prior drunk-driving convictions, McNeely was\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

The trial\ncourt agreed. It concluded that the exigency exception to\nthe warrant requirement did not apply because, apart from\nthe fact that “[a]s in all cases involving intoxication,\n[McNeely’s] blood alcohol was being metabolized by his\nliver,” there were no circumstances suggesting the officer\nfaced an emergency in which he could not practicably\nobtain a warrant.

On appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals\nstated an intention to reverse but transferred the case\ndirectly to the Missouri Supreme Court. No. ED 96402\n(June 21, 2011), id., at 24a.\n   The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed. 358 S. W. 3d 65\n(2012) (per curiam). Recognizing that this Court’s decision\nin Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, “provide[d] the\nbackdrop” to its analysis, the Missouri Supreme Court\nheld that “Schmerber directs lower courts to engage in\na totality of the circumstances analysis when determin­\ning whether exigency permits a nonconsensual, warrantless\nblood draw.” 358 S. W. 3d, at 69, 74. The court further\nconcluded that Schmerber “requires more than the mere\ndissipation of blood-alcohol evidence to support a warrant­\nless blood draw in an alcohol-related case.” 358 S. W. 3d,\nat 70. According to the court, exigency depends heavily on\nthe existence of additional “ ‘special facts,’ ” such as whether\nan officer was delayed by the need to investigate an ac-\ncident and transport an injured suspect to the hospital,\nas had been the case in Schmerber. 358 S.

MCNEELY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n74. Finding that this was “unquestionably a routine DWI\ncase” in which no factors other than the natural dissi­\npation of blood-alcohol suggested that there was an emer­\ngency, the court held that the nonconsensual warrantless\nblood draw violated McNeely’s Fourth Amendment right\nto be free from unreasonable searches of his person. Id.,\nat 74–75.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on\nthe question whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in\nthe bloodstream establishes a per se exigency that suffices\non its own to justify an exception to the warrant require­\nment for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving\ninvestigations.2 See 567 U. S. ___ (2012). We now affirm.\n                             II\n\n                               \n\n                             A\n\n   The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that\n“[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons,\nhouses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\nand seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall\nissue, but upon probable cause.” Our cases have held that\na warrantless search of the person is reasonable only if\nit falls within a recognized exception. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224 (1973). That prin­\nciple applies to the type of search at issue in this case,\nwhich involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath\nMcNeely’s skin and into his veins to obtain a sample of his\nblood for use as evidence in a criminal investigation.

Railway Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616\n(1989).\n   We first considered the Fourth Amendment restrictions\non such searches in Schmerber, where, as in this case, a\nblood sample was drawn from a defendant suspected of\ndriving while under the influence of alcohol. 384 U. S., at\n758. Noting that “[s]earch warrants are ordinarily re­\nquired for searches of dwellings,” we reasoned that “absent\nan emergency, no less could be required where intrusions\ninto the human body are concerned,” even when the search\nwas conducted following a lawful arrest. Id., at 770. We\nexplained that the importance of requiring authorization\nby a “ ‘neutral and detached magistrate’ ” before allowing a\nlaw enforcement officer to “invade another’s body in search\nof evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.” Ibid. (quot­\ning Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 13–14 (1948)).\n   As noted, the warrant requirement is subject to ex­\nceptions. “One well-recognized exception,” and the one\nat issue in this case, “applies when the exigencies of the\nsituation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling\nthat a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted). A variety of circumstances may give\nrise to an exigency sufficient to justify a warrantless\nsearch, including law enforcement’s need to provide emer­\ngency assistance to an occupant of a home, Michigan v.\nFisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47–48 (2009) (per curiam), engage in\n“hot pursuit” of a fleeing suspect, United States v. San­\ntana, 427 U.

As is relevant here,\nwe have also recognized that in some circumstances law\nenforcement officers may conduct a search without a\n6                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwarrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\nSee Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U. S. 291, 296 (1973); Ker v.\nCalifornia, 374 U. S. 23, 40–41 (1963) (plurality opinion).\nWhile these contexts do not necessarily involve equiva-\nlent dangers, in each a warrantless search is potentially\nreasonable because “there is compelling need for official\naction and no time to secure a warrant.” Tyler, 436 U. S.,\nat 509.\n   To determine whether a law enforcement officer faced\nan emergency that justified acting without a warrant, this\nCourt looks to the totality of circumstances. See Brigham\nCity v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 406 (2006) (finding officers’\nentry into a home to provide emergency assistance “plain­\nly reasonable under the circumstances”); Illinois v. Mc-\nArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 331 (2001) (concluding that a war­\nrantless seizure of a person to prevent him from returning\nto his trailer to destroy hidden contraband was reasonable\n“[i]n the circumstances of the case before us” due to exi­\ngency); Cupp, 412 U. S., at 296 (holding that a limited\nwarrantless search of a suspect’s fingernails to preserve\nevidence that the suspect was trying to rub off was justi­\nfied “[o]n the facts of this case”); see also Richards v.\nWisconsin, 520 U. S. 385, 391–396 (1997) (rejecting a\nper se exception to the knock-and-announce requirement\nfor felony drug investigations based on presumed exigen­\ncy, and requiring instead evaluation of police conduct “in\na particular case”). We apply this “finely tuned approach”\nto Fourth Amendment reasonableness in this context be-\ncause the police action at issue lacks “the traditional\njustification that . . . a warrant . . . provides.” Atwater v.\nLago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 347, n. 16 (2001). Absent that\nestablished justification, “the fact-specific nature of the\nreasonableness inquiry,” Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.

In that case, the petitioner had\nsuffered injuries in an automobile accident and was taken\nto the hospital. 384 U. S., at 758. While he was there\nreceiving treatment, a police officer arrested the petitioner\nfor driving while under the influence of alcohol and or­\ndered a blood test over his objection. Id., at 758–759.\nAfter explaining that the warrant requirement applied\ngenerally to searches that intrude into the human body,\nwe concluded that the warrantless blood test “in the pre­\nsent case” was nonetheless permissible because the officer\n“might reasonably have believed that he was confronted\nwith an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain\na warrant, under the circumstances, threatened ‘the de­\nstruction of evidence.’ ” Id., at 770 (quoting Preston v.\nUnited States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)).\n   In support of that conclusion, we observed that evidence\ncould have been lost because “the percentage of alcohol in\nthe blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,\nas the body functions to eliminate it from the system.”\n384 U. S., at 770. We added that “[p]articularly in a case\nsuch as this, where time had to be taken to bring the\naccused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the\naccident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and\nsecure a warrant.” Id., at 770–771. “Given these special\nfacts,” we found that it was appropriate for the police to\n——————\n  3 We have recognized a limited class of traditional exceptions to the\n\nwarrant requirement that apply categorically and thus do not require\nan assessment of whether the policy justifications underlying the ex-\nception, which may include exigency-based considerations, are im­\nplicated in a particular case. See, e.g., California v. Acevedo, 500\nU. S. 565, 569–570 (1991) (automobile exception); United States v.\nRobinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224–235 (1973) (searches of a person incident\nto a lawful arrest). By contrast, the general exigency exception, which\nasks whether an emergency existed that justified a warrantless search,\nnaturally calls for a case-specific inquiry.\n8                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nact without a warrant. Id., at 771. We further held that\nthe blood test at issue was a reasonable way to recover the\nevidence because it was highly effective, “involve[d] vir­\ntually no risk, trauma, or pain,” and was conducted in a\nreasonable fashion “by a physician in a hospital environ­\nment according to accepted medical practices.” Ibid. And\nin conclusion, we noted that our judgment that there had\nbeen no Fourth Amendment violation was strictly based\n“on the facts of the present record.” Id., at 772.\n   Thus, our analysis in Schmerber fits comfortably within\nour case law applying the exigent circumstances excep­\ntion. In finding the warrantless blood test reasonable in\nSchmerber, we considered all of the facts and circumstances\nof the particular case and carefully based our holding on\nthose specific facts.\n                             B\n  The State properly recognizes that the reasonableness\nof a warrantless search under the exigency exception to\nthe warrant requirement must be evaluated based on the\ntotality of the circumstances. Brief for Petitioner 28–29.\nBut the State nevertheless seeks a per se rule for blood\ntesting in drunk-driving cases. The State contends that\nwhenever an officer has probable cause to believe an\nindividual has been driving under the influence of alcohol,\nexigent circumstances will necessarily exist because BAC\nevidence is inherently evanescent. As a result, the State\nclaims that so long as the officer has probable cause and\nthe blood test is conducted in a reasonable manner, it is\ncategorically reasonable for law enforcement to obtain the\nblood sample without a warrant.\n  It is true that as a result of the human body’s natural\nmetabolic processes, the alcohol level in a person’s blood\nbegins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and\ncontinues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated. See\nSkinner, 489 U. S., at 623; Schmerber, 384 U. S., at 770–\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n771. Testimony before the trial court in this case indicated\nthat the percentage of alcohol in an individual’s blood\ntypically decreases by approximately 0.015 percent to 0.02\npercent per hour once the alcohol has been fully absorbed.\nApp. 47. More precise calculations of the rate at which\nalcohol dissipates depend on various individual character­\nistics (such as weight, gender, and alcohol tolerance) and\nthe circumstances in which the alcohol was consumed.\nSee Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol Analy­\nsis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 437–441 (L. Kobilin­\nsky ed. 2012). Regardless of the exact elimination rate, it\nis sufficient for our purposes to note that because an indi­\nvidual’s alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops\ndrinking, a significant delay in testing will negatively\naffect the probative value of the results. This fact was\nessential to our holding in Schmerber, as we recognized\nthat, under the circumstances, further delay in order to\nsecure a warrant after the time spent investigating the\nscene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect\nto the hospital to receive treatment would have threatened\nthe destruction of evidence. 384 U. S., at 770–771.\n   But it does not follow that we should depart from careful\ncase-by-case assessment of exigency and adopt the cate­\ngorical rule proposed by the State and its amici. In those\ndrunk-driving investigations where police officers can\nreasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be\ndrawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of\nthe search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they\ndo so. See McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 456\n(1948) (“We cannot . . . excuse the absence of a search\nwarrant without a showing by those who seek exemption\nfrom the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the\nsituation made [the search] imperative”). We do not doubt\nthat some circumstances will make obtaining a warrant\nimpractical such that the dissipation of alcohol from the\nbloodstream will support an exigency justifying a properly\n10                 MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconducted warrantless blood test. That, however, is a\nreason to decide each case on its facts, as we did in\nSchmerber, not to accept the “considerable overgeneraliza­\ntion” that a per se rule would reflect. Richards, 520 U. S.,\nat 393.\n   The context of blood testing is different in critical re­\nspects from other destruction-of-evidence cases in which\nthe police are truly confronted with a “ ‘now or never’ ”\nsituation. Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).\nIn contrast to, for example, circumstances in which the\nsuspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see\nGeorgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006);\nCupp, 412 U. S., at 296, BAC evidence from a drunk­\ndriving suspect naturally dissipates over time in a gradual\nand relatively predictable manner. Moreover, because a\npolice officer must typically transport a drunk-driving\nsuspect to a medical facility and obtain the assistance of\nsomeone with appropriate medical training before con­\nducting a blood test, some delay between the time of the\narrest or accident and the time of the test is inevitable\nregardless of whether police officers are required to obtain\na warrant. See State v. Shriner, 751 N. W. 2d 538, 554\n(Minn. 2008) (Meyer, J., dissenting). This reality under­\nmines the force of the State’s contention, endorsed by the\ndissent, see post, at 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), that we\nshould recognize a categorical exception to the warrant\nrequirement because BAC evidence “is actively being\ndestroyed with every minute that passes.” Brief for Peti­\ntioner 27. Consider, for example, a situation in which the\nwarrant process will not significantly increase the delay\nbefore the blood test is conducted because an officer can\ntake steps to secure a warrant while the suspect is being\ntransported to a medical facility by another officer. In\nsuch a circumstance, there would be no plausible justifica­\ntion for an exception to the warrant requirement.\n   The State’s proposed per se rule also fails to account for\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n4.1(b)(3). And improvements in communications technolo­\ngy do not guarantee that a magistrate judge will be avail­\nable when an officer needs a warrant after making a late­\nnight arrest. But technological developments that enable\npolice officers to secure warrants more quickly, and do so\nwithout undermining the neutral magistrate judge’s es­\nsential role as a check on police discretion, are relevant to\nan assessment of exigency.

But adopting the State’s per se approach would\nimproperly ignore the current and future technological\ndevelopments in warrant procedures, and might well\ndiminish the incentive for jurisdictions “to pursue progres­\nsive approaches to warrant acquisition that preserve the\nprotections afforded by the warrant while meeting the\nlegitimate interests of law enforcement.” State v.

But the per se exigency rule that the State\nseeks and the dissent embraces would apply nationally because it\ntreats “the body’s natural metabolization of alcohol” as a sufficient\nbasis for a warrantless search everywhere and always. Post, at 1. The\ntechnological innovations in warrant procedures that many States\nhave adopted are accordingly relevant to show that the per se rule is\noverbroad.\n14                  MISSOURI v.

S.,\nat 509). But THE CHIEF JUSTICE then goes on to suggest\nhis own categorical rule under which a warrantless blood\ndraw is permissible if the officer could not secure a war­\nrant (or reasonably believed he could not secure a war­\nrant) in the time it takes to transport the suspect to a\nhospital or similar facility and obtain medical assistance.\nPost, at 8–9. Although we agree that delay inherent to the\nblood-testing process is relevant to evaluating exigency,\nsee supra, at 10, we decline to substitute THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE’s modified per se rule for our traditional totality of\nthe circumstances analysis.\n   For one thing, making exigency completely dependent\non the window of time between an arrest and a blood test\nproduces odd consequences. Under THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s\nrule, if a police officer serendipitously stops a suspect near\nan emergency room, the officer may conduct a noncon-\nsensual warrantless blood draw even if all agree that a\nwarrant could be obtained with very little delay under the\ncircumstances (perhaps with far less delay than an aver­\nage ride to the hospital in the jurisdiction). The rule\nwould also distort law enforcement incentives. As with\nthe State’s per se rule, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s rule might\ndiscourage efforts to expedite the warrant process because\nit categorically authorizes warrantless blood draws so long\nas it takes more time to secure a warrant than to obtain\nmedical assistance. On the flip side, making the require­\nment of independent judicial oversight turn exclusively on\nthe amount of time that elapses between an arrest and\nBAC testing could induce police departments and individ­\nual officers to minimize testing delay to the detriment of\nother values. THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly observes that\n“[t]his case involves medical personnel drawing blood at a\nmedical facility, not police officers doing so by the side of\nthe road.” Post, at 6–7, n. 2.

THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE and the dissent also raise this concern. See post,\nat 1, 9–10 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 5–7 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.). While the desire for a bright-line rule is\nunderstandable, the Fourth Amendment will not tolerate\nadoption of an overly broad categorical approach that\nwould dilute the warrant requirement in a context where\nsignificant privacy interests are at stake. Moreover, a\ncase-by-case approach is hardly unique within our Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence. Numerous police actions\nare judged based on fact-intensive, totality of the circum­\nstances analyses rather than according to categorical\nrules, including in situations that are more likely to require\npolice officers to make difficult split-second judgments.\nSee, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 123–125\n(2000) (whether an officer has reasonable suspicion to\nmake an investigative stop and to pat down a suspect for\nweapons under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.

S. 1, 8–9, 20\n(1985) (whether force used to effectuate a seizure, includ­\ning deadly force, is reasonable). As in those contexts, we\nsee no valid substitute for careful case-by-case evaluation\n16                      MISSOURI v.

That is so, they\nclaim, both because motorists have a diminished expecta­\ntion of privacy and because our cases have repeatedly\nindicated that blood testing is commonplace in society and\ntypically involves “virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.”\nSchmerber, 384 U. S., at 771. See also post, at 3, and n. 1\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n   But the fact that people are “accorded less privacy in . . .\nautomobiles because of th[e] compelling governmental\nneed for regulation,” California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386,\n392 (1985), does not diminish a motorist’s privacy interest\nin preventing an agent of the government from piercing\nhis skin. As to the nature of a blood test conducted in a\nmedical setting by trained personnel, it is concededly less\nintrusive than other bodily invasions we have found un­\nreasonable. See Winston, 470 U. S., at 759–766 (surgery\nto remove a bullet); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165,\n172–174 (1952) (induced vomiting to extract narcotics\ncapsules ingested by a suspect violated the Due Process\nClause). For that reason, we have held that medically\ndrawn blood tests are reasonable in appropriate circum­\nstances. See Skinner, 489 U.

They argue\nthat is particularly so because, in addition to laws that\nmake it illegal to operate a motor vehicle under the influ­\nence of alcohol, all 50 States and the District of Columbia\nhave enacted laws that make it per se unlawful to operate\na motor vehicle with a BAC of over 0.08 percent.

(NHTSA), Al­\ncohol and Highway Safety: A Review of the State of\nKnowledge 167 (No. 811374, Mar. 2011) (NHTSA Re­\nview).8 To enforce these provisions, they reasonably as­\nsert, accurate BAC evidence is critical.

For example, all 50 States have\nadopted implied consent laws that require motorists, as a\ncondition of operating a motor vehicle within the State, to\nconsent to BAC testing if they are arrested or otherwise\ndetained on suspicion of a drunk-driving offense. See\nNHTSA Review 173; supra, at 2 (describing Missouri’s\nimplied consent law). Such laws impose significant conse­\nquences when a motorist withdraws consent; typically the\nmotorist’s driver’s license is immediately suspended or\nrevoked, and most States allow the motorist’s refusal to\ntake a BAC test to be used as evidence against him in a\nsubsequent criminal prosecution. See NHTSA Review\n173–175; see also South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.

We are aware of no evidence indicating that\nrestrictions on nonconsensual blood testing have compro­\nmised drunk-driving enforcement efforts in the States that\nhave them. And in fact, field studies in States that permit\nnonconsensual blood testing pursuant to a warrant have\nsuggested that, although warrants do impose administra­\ntive burdens, their use can reduce breath-test-refusal\nrates and improve law enforcement’s ability to recover\nBAC evidence. See NHTSA, Use of Warrants for Breath\nTest Refusal: Case Studies 36–38 (No. 810852, Oct. 2007).\n   To be sure, “States [may] choos[e] to protect privacy\nbeyond the level that the Fourth Amendment requires.”\nVirginia v. Moore, 553 U. S. 164, 171 (2008).

He testified that he made no effort to obtain\na search warrant before conducting the blood draw even\nthough he was “sure” a prosecuting attorney was on call\nand even though he had no reason to believe that a magis­\ntrate judge would have been unavailable. Id., at 39, 41–\n42. The officer also acknowledged that he had obtained\nsearch warrants before taking blood samples in the past\nwithout difficulty. Id., at 42. He explained that he elected\nto forgo a warrant application in this case only because he\nbelieved it was not legally necessary to obtain a warrant.\nId., at 39–40. Based on this testimony, the trial court\nconcluded that there was no exigency and specifically\nfound that, although the arrest took place in the middle of\nthe night, “a prosecutor was readily available to apply for\na search warrant and a judge was readily available to\nissue a warrant.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.11\n   The Missouri Supreme Court in turn affirmed that\njudgment, holding first that the dissipation of alcohol did\nnot establish a per se exigency, and second that the State\ncould not otherwise satisfy its burden of establishing\nexigent circumstances. 358 S.

In\npetitioning for certiorari to this Court, the State chal­\nlenged only the first holding; it did not separately contend\nthat the warrantless blood test was reasonable regardless\nof whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in a suspect’s\nblood categorically justifies dispensing with the warrant\n——————\n  11 No findings were made by the trial court concerning how long a\nwarrant would likely have taken to issue under the circumstances. The\nminimal evidence presented on this point was not uniform. A second\npatrol officer testified that in a typical DWI case, it takes between 90\nminutes and 2 hours to obtain a search warrant following an arrest.\nApp. 53–54. McNeely, however, also introduced an exhibit document­\ning six recent search warrant applications for blood testing in Cape\nGirardeau County that had shorter processing times.

See Pet. for Cert. i.\n   Here and in its own courts the State based its case on\nan insistence that a driver who declines to submit to test­\ning after being arrested for driving under the influence of\nalcohol is always subject to a nonconsensual blood test\nwithout any precondition for a warrant. That is incorrect.\n   Although the Missouri Supreme Court referred to this\ncase as “unquestionably a routine DWI case,” 358 S. W.\n3d, at 74, the fact that a particular drunk-driving stop is\n“routine” in the sense that it does not involve “ ‘special\nfacts,’ ” ibid., such as the need for the police to attend to a\ncar accident, does not mean a warrant is required. Other\nfactors present in an ordinary traffic stop, such as the\nprocedures in place for obtaining a warrant or the avail­\nability of a magistrate judge, may affect whether the police\ncan obtain a warrant in an expeditious way and therefore\nmay establish an exigency that permits a warrantless\nsearch. The relevant factors in determining whether a\nwarrantless search is reasonable, including the practical\nproblems of obtaining a warrant within a timeframe that\nstill preserves the opportunity to obtain reliable evidence,\nwill no doubt vary depending upon the circumstances in\nthe case.\n   Because this case was argued on the broad proposition\nthat drunk-driving cases present a per se exigency, the\narguments and the record do not provide the Court with\nan adequate analytic framework for a detailed discussion\nof all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in\ndetermining the reasonableness of acting without a war­\nrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol\nin the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are\namong the factors that must be considered in deciding\nwhether a warrant is required. No doubt, given the large\nnumber of arrests for this offense in different jurisdictions\nnationwide, cases will arise when anticipated delays in\nobtaining a warrant will justify a blood test without judi­\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

I have no quarrel with the Court’s “totality of the\ncircumstances” approach as a general matter; that is what\nour cases require. But the circumstances in drunk driving\ncases are often typical, and the Court should be able to\noffer guidance on how police should handle cases like the\none before us.\n   In my view, the proper rule is straightforward. Our\ncases establish that there is an exigent circumstances\nexception to the warrant requirement. That exception\napplies when there is a compelling need to prevent the\nimminent destruction of important evidence, and there is\nno time to obtain a warrant. The natural dissipation of\nalcohol in the bloodstream constitutes not only the immi-\nnent but ongoing destruction of critical evidence. That\nwould qualify as an exigent circumstance, except that\nthere may be time to secure a warrant before blood can be\ndrawn. If there is, an officer must seek a warrant. If an\nofficer could reasonably conclude that there is not, the\nexigent circumstances exception applies by its terms, and\n2                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe blood may be drawn without a warrant.\n                           I\n    The Fourth Amendment provides:\n     “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\n     searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\n     Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, sup-\n     ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly de-\n     scribing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n     things to be seized.”\nThat language does not state that warrants are required\nprior to searches, but this Court has long held that war-\nrants must generally be obtained. See Kentucky v. King,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). We have also held\nthat bodily intrusions like blood draws constitute searches\nand are subject to the warrant requirement.               See\nSchmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 767, 770 (1966).\n   However, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart,\n547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), and thus “the warrant require-\nment is subject to certain reasonable exceptions,” King,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). One of those exceptions is\nknown as the “exigent circumstances exception,” which\n“applies when the exigencies of the situation make the\nneeds of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless\nsearch is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks and altera-\ntions omitted).\n   Within the exigent circumstances exception, we have\nidentified several sets of exigent circumstances excusing\nthe need for a warrant. For example, there is an emergency\naid exception to the warrant requirement. In Brigham\nCity, supra, at 403, we held that “law enforcement officers\nmay enter a home without a warrant to render emergency\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nassistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant\nfrom imminent injury.” There is also a fire exception to\nthe warrant requirement. In Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S.\n499, 509 (1978), we held that “[a] burning building clearly\npresents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render\na warrantless entry ‘reasonable.’ ” And there is a hot pur-\nsuit exception to the warrant requirement as well. In\nUnited States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38 (1976), and War-\nden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 (1967), we\nrecognized “the right of police, who had probable cause to\nbelieve that an armed robber had entered a house a few\nminutes before, to make a warrantless entry to arrest the\nrobber and to search for weapons.” Santana, supra, at 42.\nIn each of these cases, the requirement that we base our\ndecision on the “totality of the circumstances” has not\nprevented us from spelling out a general rule for the police\nto follow.\n  The exigency exception most on point here is the one for\nimminent destruction of evidence. We have affirmed on\nseveral occasions that “law enforcement officers may make\na warrantless entry onto private property . . . to prevent\nthe imminent destruction of evidence.” Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403 (citing Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40\n(1963) (plurality opinion)); see also, e.g., King, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 6). For example, in Ker, the police had\nreason to believe that the defendant was in possession of\nmarijuana and was expecting police pursuit. We upheld\nthe officers’ warrantless entry into the defendant’s home,\nwith the plurality explaining that the drugs “could be\nquickly and easily destroyed” or “distributed or hidden\nbefore a warrant could be obtained at that time of night.”\n374 U. S., at 40, 42.\n  As an overarching principle, we have held that if there\nis a “compelling need for official action and no time to\nsecure a warrant,” the warrant requirement may be ex-\n4                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncused. Tyler, supra, at 509. The question here is whether\nand how this principle applies in the typical case of a\npolice officer stopping a driver on suspicion of drunk\ndriving.\n                                II\n\n                                  \n\n                                A\n\n   The reasonable belief that critical evidence is being\ndestroyed gives rise to a compelling need for blood draws\nin cases like this one. Here, in fact, there is not simply\na belief that any alcohol in the bloodstream will be de-\nstroyed; it is a biological certainty. Alcohol dissipates from\nthe bloodstream at a rate of 0.01 percent to 0.025 percent\nper hour. Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol\nAnalysis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 440 (L. Kobil-\ninsky ed. 2012). Evidence is literally disappearing by the\nminute. That certainty makes this case an even stronger\none than usual for application of the exigent circumstances\nexception.\n   And that evidence is important. A serious and deadly\ncrime is at issue. According to the Department of Trans-\nportation, in 2011, one person died every 53 minutes due\nto drinking and driving. National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdmin. (NHTSA), Traffic Safety Facts, 2011 Data 1 (No.\n811700, Dec. 2012). No surprise then that drinking and\ndriving is punished severely, including with jail time. See\ngenerally Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, L.\nMaruschak, Special Report, DWI Offenders under Correc-\ntional Supervision (1999). McNeely, for instance, faces up\nto four years in prison. See App. 22–23 (citing Mo. Ann.\nStat. §§558.011, 577.010, 577.023 (West 2011)).\n   Evidence of a driver’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC)\nis crucial to obtain convictions for such crimes. All 50\nStates and the District of Columbia have laws providing\nthat it is per se illegal to drive with a BAC of 0.08 percent\nor higher. Most States also have laws establishing addi-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C.

And when drivers refuse breathalyzers,\nas McNeely did here, a blood draw becomes necessary to\nobtain that evidence.\n   The need to prevent the imminent destruction of BAC\nevidence is no less compelling because the incriminating\nalcohol dissipates over a limited period of time, rather\nthan all at once. As noted, the concentration of alcohol\n can make a difference not only between guilt and inno-\ncence, but between different crimes and different degrees\nof punishment. The officer is unlikely to know precisely\nwhen the suspect consumed alcohol or how much; all he\nknows is that critical evidence is being steadily lost. Fire\ncan spread gradually, but that does not lessen the need\nand right of the officers to respond immediately. See\nTyler, supra.\n   McNeely contends that there is no compelling need for a\nwarrantless blood draw, because if there is some alcohol\nleft in the blood by the time a warrant is obtained, the\nState can use math and science to work backwards and\nidentify a defendant’s BAC at the time he was driving.\nSee Brief for Respondent 44–46. But that’s not good\nenough. We have indicated that exigent circumstances\njustify warrantless entry when drugs are about to be\nflushed down the toilet. See, e.g., King, 563 U. S., at ___–\n___ (slip op., at 7–8). We have not said that, because there\ncould well be drug paraphernalia elsewhere in the home,\nor because a defendant’s co-conspirator might testify to\nthe amount of drugs involved, the drugs themselves are\nnot crucial and there is no compelling need for warrantless\nentry.\n   The same approach should govern here. There is a\n6                       MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncompelling need to search because alcohol—the nearly\nconclusive evidence of a serious crime—is dissipating from\nthe bloodstream. The need is no less compelling because\nthe police might be able to acquire second-best evidence\nsome other way.1\n                             B\n  For exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless\nsearch, however, there must also be “no time to secure a\nwarrant.” Tyler, 436 U. S., at 509; see Schmerber, 384\nU. S., at 771 (warrantless search legal when “there was no\ntime to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant”). In\nthis respect, obtaining a blood sample from a suspected\ndrunk driver differs from other exigent circumstances\ncases.\n  Importantly, there is typically delay between the mo-\nment a drunk driver is stopped and the time his blood can\nbe drawn. Drunk drivers often end up in an emergency\nroom, but they are not usually pulled over in front of one.\nIn most exigent circumstances situations, police are just\noutside the door to a home. Inside, evidence is about to be\ndestroyed, a person is about to be injured, or a fire has\nbroken out. Police can enter promptly and must do so to\nrespond effectively to the emergency. But when police pull\na person over on suspicion of drinking and driving, they\ncannot test his blood right away.2 There is a time-\n——————\n    1 Andthat second-best evidence may prove useless. When experts\nhave worked backwards to identify a defendant’s BAC at the time he\nwas driving, defense attorneys have objected to that evidence, courts\nhave at times rejected it, and juries may be suspicious of it. See, e.g., 1\nD. Nichols & F. Whited, Drinking/Driving Litigation §2:9, pp. 2–130 to\n2–137 (2d ed. 2006) (noting counsel objections to such evidence); State\nv.

In this case, for example, approximately 25\nminutes elapsed between the time the police stopped\nMcNeely and the time his blood was drawn. App. 36, 38.\n  As noted, the fact that alcohol dissipates gradually from\nthe bloodstream does not diminish the compelling need for\na search—critical evidence is still disappearing. But the\nfact that the dissipation persists for some time means that\nthe police—although they may not be able to do anything\nabout it right away—may still be able to respond to the\nongoing destruction of evidence later on.\n  There might, therefore, be time to obtain a warrant in\nmany cases. As the Court explains, police can often re-\nquest warrants rather quickly these days. At least 30\nStates provide for electronic warrant applications. See\nante, at 10–12, and n. 4. In many States, a police officer\ncan call a judge, convey the necessary information, and be\nauthorized to affix the judge’s signature to a warrant.\nSee, e.g., Ala. Rule Crim.

If an officer could reasonably con-\nclude that there is not sufficient time to seek and receive a\nwarrant, or he applies for one but does not receive a re-\nsponse before blood can be drawn, a warrantless blood\ndraw may ensue. See Tyler, supra, at 509; see also Illinois\nv. Rodriguez, 497 U.

S. 1, 20 (1968) (“police must,\nwhenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of\nsearches and seizures through the warrant procedure”).\n   Requiring police to apply for a warrant if practicable\nincreases the likelihood that a neutral, detached judicial\nofficer will review the case, helping to ensure that there is\nprobable cause for any search and that any search is\nreasonable. We have already held that forced blood draws\ncan be constitutional—that such searches can be reasonable—\nbut that does not change the fact that they are significant\nbodily intrusions. See Schmerber, 384 U. S., at 770 (up-\nholding a warrantless forced blood draw but noting the\n“importance of informed, detached and deliberate deter-\nminations of the issue whether or not to invade another’s\nbody in search of evidence of guilt” as “indisputable and\ngreat”). Requiring a warrant whenever practicable helps\nensure that when blood draws occur, they are indeed\njustified.\n   At the same time, permitting the police to act without a\nwarrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence\nis well established in Fourth Amendment law. There is no\nreason to preclude application of that exception in drunk\ndriving cases simply because it may take the police some\ntime to be able to respond to the undoubted destruction of\nevidence, or because the destruction occurs continuously\nover an uncertain period.\n   And that is so even in situations where police have\nrequested a warrant but do not receive a timely response.\nAn officer who reasonably concluded there was no time to\nsecure a warrant may have blood drawn from a suspect\nupon arrival at a medical facility. There is no reason an\nofficer should be in a worse position, simply because he\nsought a warrant prior to his arrival at the hospital.\n10                 MISSOURI v.

J.\n\n                             B\n   The Court resists the foregoing, contending that the\nquestion presented somehow inhibits such a focused anal-\nysis in this case. See ante, at 20–23. It does not. The\nquestion presented is whether a warrantless blood draw is\npermissible under the Fourth Amendment “based upon\nthe natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream.”\nPet. for Cert. i. The majority answers “It depends,” and\nso do I. The difference is that the majority offers no ad-\nditional guidance, merely instructing courts and police\nofficers to consider the totality of the circumstances. I\nbelieve more meaningful guidance can be provided about\nhow to handle the typical cases, and nothing about the\nquestion presented prohibits affording that guidance.\n   A plurality of the Court also expresses concern that my\napproach will discourage state and local efforts to expedite\nthe warrant application process. See ante, at 14. That is\nnot plausible: Police and prosecutors need warrants in a\nwide variety of situations, and often need them quickly.\nThey certainly would not prefer a slower process, just\nbecause that might obviate the need to ask for a warrant\nin the occasional drunk driving case in which a blood draw\nis necessary. The plurality’s suggestion also overlooks the\ninterest of law enforcement in the protection a warrant\nprovides.\n   The Court is correct when it says that every case must\nbe considered on its particular facts. But the pertinent\nfacts in drunk driving cases are often the same, and the\npolice should know how to act in recurring factual situa-\ntions. Simply put, when a drunk driving suspect fails field\nsobriety tests and refuses a breathalyzer, whether a war-\nrant is required for a blood draw should come down to\nwhether there is time to secure one.\n   Schmerber itself provides support for such an analysis.\nThe Court there made much of the fact that “there was no\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Because the body’s natural meta­\nbolization of alcohol inevitably destroys evidence of the\ncrime, it constitutes an exigent circumstance. As a result, I\nwould hold that a warrantless blood draw does not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Fourth Amendment states that “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons . . . against unreason­\nable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.” Before a\nsearch occurs, “a warrant must generally be secured,”\nKentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5),\nbut “this presumption may be overcome in some circum­\nstances because ‘[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is “reasonableness.” ’ ” Ibid. (quoting Brig­\nham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006); alteration\nin original).\n  The presence of “exigent circumstances” is one such\nexception to the warrant requirement.

MCNEELY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhen “ ‘the needs of law enforcement [are] so compelling\nthat [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment.’ ” 563 U.

Thus, when exigent circum­\nstances are present, officers may take actions that would\ntypically require a warrant, such as entering a home in\nhot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. 563 U.

As relevant in this case, officers may also conduct\na warrantless search when they have probable cause to\nbelieve that failure to act would result in “ ‘imminent\ndestruction of evidence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403).\n                              B\n   Once police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each\npassing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime.\nThe human liver eliminates alcohol from the bloodstream\nat a rate of approximately 0.015 percent to 0.020 percent\nper hour, ante, at 8, with some heavy drinkers as high as\n0.022 percent per hour, Brief for Petitioner 21 (citing\nmedical studies), depending on, among other things, a per-\nson’s sex, weight, body type, and drinking history. Ante,\nat 8–9; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\nThe Court has acknowledged this fact since Schmerber v.\nCalifornia, 384 U. S. 757, 770 (1966) (“We are told that the\npercentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly\nafter drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate\nit from the system”). In that case, the Court recognized\nthat destruction of evidence is inherent in drunk-driving\ncases and held that an officer investigating a drunk­\ndriving crime “might reasonably [believe] that he [is]\nconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay neces­\nsary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threat­\nen[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Preston\nv. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). The Court\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

S., at 771. The\nCourt, therefore, held that dissipation of alcohol in the\nblood constitutes an exigency that allows a blood draw\nwithout a warrant.\n   The rapid destruction of evidence acknowledged by the\nparties, the majority, and Schmerber’s exigency determi­\nnation occurs in every situation where police have probable\ncause to arrest a drunk driver. In turn, that destruction\nof evidence implicates the exigent-circumstances doctrine.\nSee Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U. S. 291 (1973). In Cupp,\nofficers questioning a murder suspect observed a spot on\nthe suspect’s finger that they believed might be dried\nblood. Id., at 292. After the suspect began making obvi­\nous efforts to remove the spots from his hands, the officers\ntook samples without obtaining either his consent or a\nwarrant. Id., at 296. Following a Fourth Amendment\nchallenge to this search, the Court held that the “ready\ndestructibility of the evidence” and the suspect’s observed\nefforts to destroy it “justified the police in subjecting him\nto the very limited search necessary to preserve the highly\nevanescent evidence they found under his fingernails.”\nIbid.\n   In this case, a similar exigency is present. Just as the\nsuspect’s efforts to destroy “highly evanescent evidence”\ngave rise to the exigency in Cupp, the natural metaboliza­\ntion of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) creates an exi­\ngency once police have probable cause to believe the driver\n\n——————\n  1 Neither party has challenged this determination, which this Court\nhas reaffirmed several times. See, e.g., Skinner v. Railway Labor\nExecutives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 625 (1989); Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S.\n753, 761–763 (1985).\n4                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis drunk. It naturally follows that police may conduct a\nsearch in these circumstances.\n   A hypothetical involving classic exigent circumstances\nfurther illustrates the point. Officers are watching a\nwarehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from\nthe warehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into\nthe blaze. The officers have probable cause to believe\nthe bundles contain marijuana. Because there is only one\nperson carrying the bundles, the officers believe it will\ntake hours to completely destroy the drugs. During that\ntime the officers likely could obtain a warrant. But it is\nclear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch the\ndestruction of evidence while they wait for a warrant. The\nfact that it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed\nand that some evidence may remain by the time the offi­\ncers secure a warrant are not relevant to the exigency.\nHowever, the ever-diminishing quantity of drugs may\nhave an impact on the severity of the crime and the\nlength of the sentence. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(D)\n(lower penalties for less than 50 kilograms of marijuana);\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n§2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2012) (drug quantity table tying base\noffense level to drug amounts). Conducting a warrantless\nsearch of the warehouse in this situation would be entirely\nreasonable.\n   The same obtains in the drunk-driving context. Just\nbecause it will take time for the evidence to be completely\ndestroyed does not mean there is no exigency. Congress\nhas conditioned federal highway grants on states’ adoption\nof laws penalizing the operation of a motor vehicle “with a\nblood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or greater.” 23\nU. S.

Moreover, as of 2005, 32\nStates and the District of Columbia imposed additional\npenalties for BAC levels of 0.15 percent or higher. NHTSA\nState Review 175. Missouri is one such State. See, e.g.,\nMo. Stat. Ann. §§577.010(3)–(4), 577.012(4)–(5) (suspended\nsentence unavailable even for first offenders with BAC\nabove 0.15 percent unless they complete drug treatment;\nmandatory jail time if treatment is not completed). As a\nresult, the level of intoxication directly bears on enforce­\nment of these laws. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment\nrequires officers to allow evidence essential to enforcement\nof drunk-driving laws to be destroyed while they wait for a\nwarrant to issue.\n                              II\n  In today’s decision, the Court elides the certainty of\nevidence destruction in drunk-driving cases and focuses\nprimarily on the time necessary for destruction. In doing\nso, it turns the exigency inquiry into a question about the\namount of evidentiary destruction police must permit\nbefore they may act without a warrant. That inquiry is\ninconsistent with the actual exigency at issue: the un­\ncontested destruction of evidence due to metabolization of\nalcohol. See Part I, supra. Moreover, the Court’s facts­\nand-circumstances analysis will be difficult to administer,\na particularly important concern in the Fourth Amend­\nment context.\n  The Court’s judgment reflects nothing more than a\nvague notion that everything will come out right most of\nthe time so long as the delay is not too lengthy. Ante, at\n12 (justifying delays in part because “BAC evidence is lost\ngradually and relatively predictably”); ante, at 10 (same,\nquoting Brief for Petitioner 27). But hard percentage lines\nhave meaningful legal consequences in the drunk-driving\ncontext. The fact that police will be able to retrieve some\n6                   MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nevidence before it is all destroyed is simply not relevant to\nthe exigency inquiry.\n   The majority believes that, absent special facts and\ncircumstances, some destruction of evidence is acceptable.\nSee ante, at 9 (“sufficient for our purposes to note that . . .\nsignificant delay in testing will negatively affect the pro­\nbative value” (emphasis added)). This belief must rest\non the assumption that whatever evidence remains once a\nwarrant is obtained will be sufficient to prosecute the\nsuspect. But that assumption is clearly wrong. Suspects’\ninitial levels of intoxication and the time necessary to\nobtain warranted blood draws will vary widely from case\nto case. Even a slight delay may significantly affect pro­\nbative value in borderline cases of suspects who are mod­\nerately intoxicated or suspects whose BAC is near a statu­\ntory threshold that triggers a more serious offense. See\nsupra, at 4–5 (discussing laws penalizing heightened BAC\nlevels). Similarly, the time to obtain a warrant can be ex­\npected to vary, and there is no reason to believe it will\ndo so in a predictable fashion.\n   Further, the Court nowhere explains how an officer in\nthe field is to apply the facts-and-circumstances test it\nadopts. First, officers do not have the facts needed to\nassess how much time can pass before too little evidence\nremains. They will never know how intoxicated a suspect\nis at the time of arrest. Otherwise, there would be no need\nfor testing. Second, they will not know how long it will\ntake to roust a magistrate from his bed, reach the hospital,\nor obtain a blood sample once there. As the Minnesota\nSupreme Court recognized in rejecting arguments like\nthose adopted by the Court today:\n    “[T]he officer has no control over how long it would\n    take to travel to a judge or the judge’s availability.\n    The officer also may not know the time of the sus­\n    pect’s last drink, the amount of alcohol consumed, or\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

W. 2d 538, 549 (2008) (footnote omitted).\nThe Court should not adopt a rule that requires police to\nguess whether they will be able to obtain a warrant before\n“too much” evidence is destroyed, for the police lack reli-\nable information concerning the relevant variables.2\n   This case demonstrates the uncertainty officers face\nwith regard to the delay caused by obtaining a warrant.\nThe arresting officer clearly had probable cause to believe\nrespondent was drunk, but there was no way for the of­\nficer to quantify the level of intoxication to determine how\nquickly he needed to act in order to obtain probative evi­\ndence. Another officer testified at respondent’s trial that\nit typically took 1 ½ to 2 hours to obtain a drunk-driving\nwarrant at night in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri.\nSee App. 53–54. Respondent submitted an exhibit sum­\nmarizing six late afternoon and nighttime drunk-driving\nsearch warrants that suggests the time may be shorter.\n——————\n  2 Because the Court’s position is likely to result in delay in obtaining\n\nBAC evidence, it also increases the likelihood that prosecutors will be\nforced to estimate the amount of alcohol in a defendant’s bloodstream\nusing BAC numbers obtained hours later. In practice, this backwards\nextrapolation is likely to devolve into a battle of the experts, as each\nside seeks to show that stale evidence supports its position. There is no\nneed for this outcome. Police facing inevitable destruction situations\nneed not forgo collecting the most accurate available evidence simply\nbecause they might be able to use an expert witness and less persuasive\nevidence to approximate what they lost.\n8                    MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for Respondent 56; App. 70. Ultimately this factual\ntiff is beside the point; the spotty evidence regarding\ntiming itself illustrates the fact that delays in obtaining\nwarrants are unpredictable and potentially lengthy. A\nrule that requires officers (and ultimately courts) to bal­\nance transportation delays, hospital availability, and ac-\ncess to magistrates is not a workable rule for cases where\nnatural processes inevitably destroy the evidence with\nevery passing minute.\n   The availability of telephonic warrant applications is\nnot an answer to this conundrum. See ante, at 10–12,\nand n. 4. For one thing, Missouri still requires written\nwarrant applications and affidavits, Mo. Ann. Stat.\n§§542.276.2(1), 542.276.2.3 (West Supp. 2012), rendering\nthe Court’s 50-State survey irrelevant to the actual dispo­\nsition of this case. Ante, at 11, n. 4. But even if telephonic\napplications were available in Missouri, the same difficul­\nties would arise. As the majority correctly recognizes,\n“[w]arrants inevitably take some time for police officers\nor prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to\nreview.” Ante, at 12. During that time, evidence is de­\nstroyed, and police who have probable cause to believe a\ncrime has been committed should not have to guess how\nlong it will take to secure a warrant.\n\n                          *    *    * \n\n    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n\n</pre>", "id": 858288, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/04/17/missouri_v._mcneely.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

MCNEELY\n\n       CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF MISSOURI\n\n    No. 11–1425. Argued January 9, 2013—Decided April 17, 2013\nRespondent McNeely was stopped by a Missouri police officer for speed-\n  ing and crossing the centerline. After declining to take a breath test\n  to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC), he was arrested\n  and taken to a nearby hospital for blood testing. The officer never at-\n  tempted to secure a search warrant. McNeely refused to consent to\n  the blood test, but the officer directed a lab technician to take a sam-\n  ple. McNeely’s BAC tested well above the legal limit, and he was\n  charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He moved to suppress\n  the blood test result, arguing that taking his blood without a warrant\n  violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The trial court agreed, con-\n  cluding that the exigency exception to the warrant requirement did\n  not apply because, apart from the fact that McNeely’s blood alcohol\n  was dissipating, no circumstances suggested that the officer faced an\n  emergency.      The State Supreme Court affirmed, relying on\n  Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, in which this Court upheld a\n  DWI suspect’s warrantless blood test where the officer “might rea-\n  sonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in\n  which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circum-\n  stances, threatened ‘the destruction of evidence,’ ” id., at 770. This\n  case, the state court found, involved a routine DWI investigation\n  where no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood alcohol\n  suggested that there was an emergency, and, thus, the nonconsensu-\n  al warrantless test violated McNeely’s right to be free from unrea-\n  sonable searches of his person.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n358 S. W. 3d 65, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n  to Parts I, II–A, II–B, and IV, concluding that in drunk-driving inves-\n  tigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does\n2                        MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conduct-\n    ing a blood test without a warrant. Pp. 4–13, 20–23.\n       (a) The principle that a warrantless search of the person is reason-\n    able only if it falls within a recognized exception, see, e.g., United\n    States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224, applies here, where the search\n    involved a compelled physical intrusion beneath McNeely’s skin and\n    into his veins to obtain a blood sample to use as evidence in a crimi-\n    nal investigation. One recognized exception “applies when ‘ “the exi-\n    gencies of the situation” make the needs of law enforcement so com-\n    pelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable.’ ”\n    Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___. This Court looks to the totality\n    of circumstances in determining whether an exigency exits. See\n    Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 406. Applying this approach\n    in Schmerber, the Court found a warrantless blood test reasonable af-\n    ter considering all of the facts and circumstances of that case and\n    carefully basing its holding on those specific facts, including that al-\n    cohol levels decline after drinking stops and that testing was delayed\n    while officers transported the injured suspect to the hospital and in-\n    vestigated the accident scene. Pp. 4–8.\n       (b) The State nonetheless seeks a per se rule, contending that exi-\n    gent circumstances necessarily exist when an officer has probable\n    cause to believe a person has been driving under the influence of al-\n    cohol because BAC evidence is inherently evanescent. Though a per-\n    son’s blood alcohol level declines until the alcohol is eliminated, it\n    does not follow that the Court should depart from careful case-by-\n    case assessment of exigency. When officers in drunk-driving investi-\n    gations can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sam-\n    ple drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the\n    search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so. See\n    McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 456. Circumstances may\n    make obtaining a warrant impractical such that the alcohol’s dissipa-\n    tion will support an exigency, but that is a reason to decide each case\n    on its facts, as in Schmerber, not to accept the “considerable overgen-\n    eralization” that a per se rule would reflect, Richards v. Wisconsin,\n    520 U. S. 385, 393. Blood testing is different in critical respects from\n    other destruction-of-evidence cases. Unlike a situation where, e.g., a\n    suspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see Cupp v. Mur-\n    phy, 412 U. S. 291, 296, BAC evidence naturally dissipates in a grad-\n    ual and relatively predictable manner. Moreover, because an officer\n    must typically take a DWI suspect to a medical facility and obtain a\n    trained medical professional’s assistance before having a blood test\n    conducted, some delay between the time of the arrest or accident and\n    time of the test is inevitable regardless of whether a warrant is ob-\n    tained. The State’s rule also fails to account for advances in the 47\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  years since Schmerber was decided that allow for the more expedi-\n  tious processing of warrant applications, particularly in contexts like\n  drunk-driving investigations where the evidence supporting probable\n  cause is simple. The natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood may\n  support an exigency finding in a specific case, as it did in Schmerber,\n  but it does not do so categorically. Pp. 8–13.\n     (c) Because the State sought a per se rule here, it did not argue that\n  there were exigent circumstances in this particular case. The argu-\n  ments and the record thus do not provide the Court with an adequate\n  framework for a detailed discussion of all the relevant factors that\n  can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of act-\n  ing without a warrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of\n  alcohol in the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are\n  among the factors that must be considered in deciding whether a\n  warrant is required. Pp. 20–23.\n     JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE GINSBURG,\n  and JUSTICE KAGAN, concluded in Part III that other arguments ad-\n  vanced by the State and amici in support of a per se rule are unper-\n  suasive. Their concern that a case-by-case approach to exigency will\n  not provide adequate guidance to law enforcement officers may make\n  the desire for a bright-line rule understandable, but the Fourth\n  Amendment will not tolerate adoption of an overly broad categorical\n  approach in this context. A fact-intensive, totality of the circum-\n  stances, approach is hardly unique within this Court’s Fourth\n  Amendment jurisprudence. See, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S.\n  119, 123–125. They also contend that the privacy interest implicated\n  here is minimal. But motorists’ diminished expectation of privacy\n  does not diminish their privacy interest in preventing a government\n  agent from piercing their skin. And though a blood test conducted in\n  a medical setting by trained personnel is less intrusive than other\n  bodily invasions, this Court has never retreated from its recognition\n  that any compelled intrusion into the human body implicates signifi-\n  cant, constitutionally protected privacy interests. Finally, the gov-\n  ernment’s general interest in combating drunk driving does not justi-\n  fy departing from the warrant requirement without showing exigent\n  circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a particu-\n  lar case.

California, 384 U. S. 757 (1966), this\nCourt upheld a warrantless blood test of an individual\narrested for driving under the influence of alcohol because\nthe officer “might reasonably have believed that he was\nconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay neces­\nsary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threat­\nened the destruction of evidence.” Id., at 770 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The question presented here\nis whether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the\nbloodstream presents a per se exigency that justifies an\nexception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant require­\nment for nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving\ncases. We conclude that it does not, and we hold, con­\nsistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that\nexigency in this context must be determined case by case\nbased on the totality of the circumstances.\n2                          MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n   While on highway patrol at approximately 2:08 a.m., a\nMissouri police officer stopped Tyler McNeely’s truck after\nobserving it exceed the posted speed limit and repeatedly\ncross the centerline. The officer noticed several signs\nthat McNeely was intoxicated, including McNeely’s blood­\nshot eyes, his slurred speech, and the smell of alcohol on his\nbreath. McNeely acknowledged to the officer that he had\nconsumed “a couple of beers” at a bar, App. 20, and he\nappeared unsteady on his feet when he exited the truck.\nAfter McNeely performed poorly on a battery of field­\nsobriety tests and declined to use a portable breath-test\ndevice to measure his blood alcohol concentration (BAC),\nthe officer placed him under arrest.\n   The officer began to transport McNeely to the station\nhouse. But when McNeely indicated that he would again\nrefuse to provide a breath sample, the officer changed\ncourse and took McNeely to a nearby hospital for blood\ntesting. The officer did not attempt to secure a warrant.\nUpon arrival at the hospital, the officer asked McNeely\nwhether he would consent to a blood test. Reading from\na standard implied consent form, the officer explained to\nMcNeely that under state law refusal to submit voluntar-\nily to the test would lead to the immediate revocation of his\ndriver’s license for one year and could be used against him\nin a future prosecution. See Mo. Ann. Stat. §§577.020.1,\n577.041 (West 2011). McNeely nonetheless refused. The\nofficer then directed a hospital lab technician to take a\nblood sample, and the sample was secured at approxi­\nmately 2:35 a.m. Subsequent laboratory testing measured\nMcNeely’s BAC at 0.154 percent, which was well above the\nlegal limit of 0.08 percent. See §577.012.1.\n   McNeely was charged with driving while intoxicated\n(DWI), in violation of §577.010.1 He moved to suppress\n——————\n    1 As   a result of his two prior drunk-driving convictions, McNeely was\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

The trial\ncourt agreed. It concluded that the exigency exception to\nthe warrant requirement did not apply because, apart from\nthe fact that “[a]s in all cases involving intoxication,\n[McNeely’s] blood alcohol was being metabolized by his\nliver,” there were no circumstances suggesting the officer\nfaced an emergency in which he could not practicably\nobtain a warrant.

On appeal, the Missouri Court of Appeals\nstated an intention to reverse but transferred the case\ndirectly to the Missouri Supreme Court. No. ED 96402\n(June 21, 2011), id., at 24a.\n   The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed. 358 S. W. 3d 65\n(2012) (per curiam). Recognizing that this Court’s decision\nin Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, “provide[d] the\nbackdrop” to its analysis, the Missouri Supreme Court\nheld that “Schmerber directs lower courts to engage in\na totality of the circumstances analysis when determin­\ning whether exigency permits a nonconsensual, warrantless\nblood draw.” 358 S. W. 3d, at 69, 74. The court further\nconcluded that Schmerber “requires more than the mere\ndissipation of blood-alcohol evidence to support a warrant­\nless blood draw in an alcohol-related case.” 358 S. W. 3d,\nat 70. According to the court, exigency depends heavily on\nthe existence of additional “ ‘special facts,’ ” such as whether\nan officer was delayed by the need to investigate an ac-\ncident and transport an injured suspect to the hospital,\nas had been the case in Schmerber. 358 S.

Finding that this was “unquestionably a routine DWI\ncase” in which no factors other than the natural dissi­\npation of blood-alcohol suggested that there was an emer­\ngency, the court held that the nonconsensual warrantless\nblood draw violated McNeely’s Fourth Amendment right\nto be free from unreasonable searches of his person. Id.,\nat 74–75.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on\nthe question whether the natural dissipation of alcohol in\nthe bloodstream establishes a per se exigency that suffices\non its own to justify an exception to the warrant require­\nment for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving\ninvestigations.2 See 567 U.

See, e.g., United\nStates v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224 (1973).

Railway Labor Executives’ Assn., 489 U.

S., at\n758. Noting that “[s]earch warrants are ordinarily re­\nquired for searches of dwellings,” we reasoned that “absent\nan emergency, no less could be required where intrusions\ninto the human body are concerned,” even when the search\nwas conducted following a lawful arrest. Id., at 770. We\nexplained that the importance of requiring authorization\nby a “ ‘neutral and detached magistrate’ ” before allowing a\nlaw enforcement officer to “invade another’s body in search\nof evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.” Ibid. (quot­\ning Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 13–14 (1948)).\n   As noted, the warrant requirement is subject to ex­\nceptions. “One well-recognized exception,” and the one\nat issue in this case, “applies when the exigencies of the\nsituation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling\nthat a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___,\n___ (2011) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted). A variety of circumstances may give\nrise to an exigency sufficient to justify a warrantless\nsearch, including law enforcement’s need to provide emer­\ngency assistance to an occupant of a home, Michigan v.\nFisher, 558 U. S. 45, 47–48 (2009) (per curiam), engage in\n“hot pursuit” of a fleeing suspect, United States v. San­\ntana, 427 U.

As is relevant here,\nwe have also recognized that in some circumstances law\nenforcement officers may conduct a search without a\n6                  MISSOURI v.

In that case, the petitioner had\nsuffered injuries in an automobile accident and was taken\nto the hospital. 384 U. S., at 758. While he was there\nreceiving treatment, a police officer arrested the petitioner\nfor driving while under the influence of alcohol and or­\ndered a blood test over his objection. Id., at 758–759.\nAfter explaining that the warrant requirement applied\ngenerally to searches that intrude into the human body,\nwe concluded that the warrantless blood test “in the pre­\nsent case” was nonetheless permissible because the officer\n“might reasonably have believed that he was confronted\nwith an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain\na warrant, under the circumstances, threatened ‘the de­\nstruction of evidence.’ ” Id., at 770 (quoting Preston v.\nUnited States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)).\n   In support of that conclusion, we observed that evidence\ncould have been lost because “the percentage of alcohol in\nthe blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops,\nas the body functions to eliminate it from the system.”\n384 U. S., at 770. We added that “[p]articularly in a case\nsuch as this, where time had to be taken to bring the\naccused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the\naccident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and\nsecure a warrant.” Id., at 770–771. “Given these special\nfacts,” we found that it was appropriate for the police to\n——————\n  3 We have recognized a limited class of traditional exceptions to the\n\nwarrant requirement that apply categorically and thus do not require\nan assessment of whether the policy justifications underlying the ex-\nception, which may include exigency-based considerations, are im­\nplicated in a particular case. See, e.g., California v. Acevedo, 500\nU. S. 565, 569–570 (1991) (automobile exception); United States v.\nRobinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224–235 (1973) (searches of a person incident\nto a lawful arrest). By contrast, the general exigency exception, which\nasks whether an emergency existed that justified a warrantless search,\nnaturally calls for a case-specific inquiry.\n8                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nact without a warrant. Id., at 771. We further held that\nthe blood test at issue was a reasonable way to recover the\nevidence because it was highly effective, “involve[d] vir­\ntually no risk, trauma, or pain,” and was conducted in a\nreasonable fashion “by a physician in a hospital environ­\nment according to accepted medical practices.” Ibid. And\nin conclusion, we noted that our judgment that there had\nbeen no Fourth Amendment violation was strictly based\n“on the facts of the present record.” Id., at 772.\n   Thus, our analysis in Schmerber fits comfortably within\nour case law applying the exigent circumstances excep­\ntion. In finding the warrantless blood test reasonable in\nSchmerber, we considered all of the facts and circumstances\nof the particular case and carefully based our holding on\nthose specific facts.\n                             B\n  The State properly recognizes that the reasonableness\nof a warrantless search under the exigency exception to\nthe warrant requirement must be evaluated based on the\ntotality of the circumstances. Brief for Petitioner 28–29.\nBut the State nevertheless seeks a per se rule for blood\ntesting in drunk-driving cases. The State contends that\nwhenever an officer has probable cause to believe an\nindividual has been driving under the influence of alcohol,\nexigent circumstances will necessarily exist because BAC\nevidence is inherently evanescent. As a result, the State\nclaims that so long as the officer has probable cause and\nthe blood test is conducted in a reasonable manner, it is\ncategorically reasonable for law enforcement to obtain the\nblood sample without a warrant.\n  It is true that as a result of the human body’s natural\nmetabolic processes, the alcohol level in a person’s blood\nbegins to dissipate once the alcohol is fully absorbed and\ncontinues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated. See\nSkinner, 489 U. S., at 623; Schmerber, 384 U. S., at 770–\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n771. Testimony before the trial court in this case indicated\nthat the percentage of alcohol in an individual’s blood\ntypically decreases by approximately 0.015 percent to 0.02\npercent per hour once the alcohol has been fully absorbed.\nApp. 47. More precise calculations of the rate at which\nalcohol dissipates depend on various individual character­\nistics (such as weight, gender, and alcohol tolerance) and\nthe circumstances in which the alcohol was consumed.\nSee Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol Analy­\nsis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 437–441 (L. Kobilin­\nsky ed. 2012). Regardless of the exact elimination rate, it\nis sufficient for our purposes to note that because an indi­\nvidual’s alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops\ndrinking, a significant delay in testing will negatively\naffect the probative value of the results. This fact was\nessential to our holding in Schmerber, as we recognized\nthat, under the circumstances, further delay in order to\nsecure a warrant after the time spent investigating the\nscene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect\nto the hospital to receive treatment would have threatened\nthe destruction of evidence. 384 U. S., at 770–771.\n   But it does not follow that we should depart from careful\ncase-by-case assessment of exigency and adopt the cate­\ngorical rule proposed by the State and its amici. In those\ndrunk-driving investigations where police officers can\nreasonably obtain a warrant before a blood sample can be\ndrawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of\nthe search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they\ndo so. See McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 456\n(1948) (“We cannot . . . excuse the absence of a search\nwarrant without a showing by those who seek exemption\nfrom the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the\nsituation made [the search] imperative”). We do not doubt\nthat some circumstances will make obtaining a warrant\nimpractical such that the dissipation of alcohol from the\nbloodstream will support an exigency justifying a properly\n10                 MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconducted warrantless blood test. That, however, is a\nreason to decide each case on its facts, as we did in\nSchmerber, not to accept the “considerable overgeneraliza­\ntion” that a per se rule would reflect. Richards, 520 U. S.,\nat 393.\n   The context of blood testing is different in critical re­\nspects from other destruction-of-evidence cases in which\nthe police are truly confronted with a “ ‘now or never’ ”\nsituation. Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496, 505 (1973).\nIn contrast to, for example, circumstances in which the\nsuspect has control over easily disposable evidence, see\nGeorgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103, 116, n. 6 (2006);\nCupp, 412 U. S., at 296, BAC evidence from a drunk­\ndriving suspect naturally dissipates over time in a gradual\nand relatively predictable manner. Moreover, because a\npolice officer must typically transport a drunk-driving\nsuspect to a medical facility and obtain the assistance of\nsomeone with appropriate medical training before con­\nducting a blood test, some delay between the time of the\narrest or accident and the time of the test is inevitable\nregardless of whether police officers are required to obtain\na warrant. See State v. Shriner, 751 N. W. 2d 538, 554\n(Minn. 2008) (Meyer, J., dissenting). This reality under­\nmines the force of the State’s contention, endorsed by the\ndissent, see post, at 3 (opinion of THOMAS, J.), that we\nshould recognize a categorical exception to the warrant\nrequirement because BAC evidence “is actively being\ndestroyed with every minute that passes.” Brief for Peti­\ntioner 27. Consider, for example, a situation in which the\nwarrant process will not significantly increase the delay\nbefore the blood test is conducted because an officer can\ntake steps to secure a warrant while the suspect is being\ntransported to a medical facility by another officer. In\nsuch a circumstance, there would be no plausible justifica­\ntion for an exception to the warrant requirement.\n   The State’s proposed per se rule also fails to account for\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\n4.1(b)(3). And improvements in communications technolo­\ngy do not guarantee that a magistrate judge will be avail­\nable when an officer needs a warrant after making a late­\nnight arrest. But technological developments that enable\npolice officers to secure warrants more quickly, and do so\nwithout undermining the neutral magistrate judge’s es­\nsential role as a check on police discretion, are relevant to\nan assessment of exigency.

For that\nreason, exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless\nblood sample may arise in the regular course of law en­\nforcement due to delays from the warrant application\nprocess. But adopting the State’s per se approach would\nimproperly ignore the current and future technological\ndevelopments in warrant procedures, and might well\ndiminish the incentive for jurisdictions “to pursue progres­\nsive approaches to warrant acquisition that preserve the\nprotections afforded by the warrant while meeting the\nlegitimate interests of law enforcement.” State v.

But THE CHIEF JUSTICE then goes on to suggest\nhis own categorical rule under which a warrantless blood\ndraw is permissible if the officer could not secure a war­\nrant (or reasonably believed he could not secure a war­\nrant) in the time it takes to transport the suspect to a\nhospital or similar facility and obtain medical assistance.\nPost, at 8–9. Although we agree that delay inherent to the\nblood-testing process is relevant to evaluating exigency,\nsee supra, at 10, we decline to substitute THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE’s modified per se rule for our traditional totality of\nthe circumstances analysis.\n   For one thing, making exigency completely dependent\non the window of time between an arrest and a blood test\nproduces odd consequences. Under THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s\nrule, if a police officer serendipitously stops a suspect near\nan emergency room, the officer may conduct a noncon-\nsensual warrantless blood draw even if all agree that a\nwarrant could be obtained with very little delay under the\ncircumstances (perhaps with far less delay than an aver­\nage ride to the hospital in the jurisdiction). The rule\nwould also distort law enforcement incentives. As with\nthe State’s per se rule, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s rule might\ndiscourage efforts to expedite the warrant process because\nit categorically authorizes warrantless blood draws so long\nas it takes more time to secure a warrant than to obtain\nmedical assistance. On the flip side, making the require­\nment of independent judicial oversight turn exclusively on\nthe amount of time that elapses between an arrest and\nBAC testing could induce police departments and individ­\nual officers to minimize testing delay to the detriment of\nother values. THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly observes that\n“[t]his case involves medical personnel drawing blood at a\nmedical facility, not police officers doing so by the side of\nthe road.” Post, at 6–7, n. 2.

THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE and the dissent also raise this concern. See post,\nat 1, 9–10 (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.); post, at 5–7 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.). While the desire for a bright-line rule is\nunderstandable, the Fourth Amendment will not tolerate\nadoption of an overly broad categorical approach that\nwould dilute the warrant requirement in a context where\nsignificant privacy interests are at stake. Moreover, a\ncase-by-case approach is hardly unique within our Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence. Numerous police actions\nare judged based on fact-intensive, totality of the circum­\nstances analyses rather than according to categorical\nrules, including in situations that are more likely to require\npolice officers to make difficult split-second judgments.\nSee, e.g., Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U. S. 119, 123–125\n(2000) (whether an officer has reasonable suspicion to\nmake an investigative stop and to pat down a suspect for\nweapons under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968)); Robi-\nnette, 519 U. S., at 39–40 (whether valid consent has been\ngiven to search); Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U. S. 1, 8–9, 20\n(1985) (whether force used to effectuate a seizure, includ­\ning deadly force, is reasonable). As in those contexts, we\nsee no valid substitute for careful case-by-case evaluation\n16                      MISSOURI v.

That is so, they\nclaim, both because motorists have a diminished expecta­\ntion of privacy and because our cases have repeatedly\nindicated that blood testing is commonplace in society and\ntypically involves “virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.”\nSchmerber, 384 U. S., at 771. See also post, at 3, and n. 1\n(opinion of THOMAS, J.).\n   But the fact that people are “accorded less privacy in . . .\nautomobiles because of th[e] compelling governmental\nneed for regulation,” California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386,\n392 (1985), does not diminish a motorist’s privacy interest\nin preventing an agent of the government from piercing\nhis skin. As to the nature of a blood test conducted in a\nmedical setting by trained personnel, it is concededly less\nintrusive than other bodily invasions we have found un­\nreasonable. See Winston, 470 U. S., at 759–766 (surgery\nto remove a bullet); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165,\n172–174 (1952) (induced vomiting to extract narcotics\ncapsules ingested by a suspect violated the Due Process\nClause). For that reason, we have held that medically\ndrawn blood tests are reasonable in appropriate circum­\nstances. See Skinner, 489 U. S., at 618–633 (upholding\n——————\n  7 The dissent contends that officers in the field will be unable to apply\n\nthe traditional totality of the circumstances test in this context because\nthey will not know all of the relevant facts at the time of an arrest.\nSee post, at 6.

We have never\nretreated, however, from our recognition that any com­\npelled intrusion into the human body implicates signifi­\ncant, constitutionally protected privacy interests.\n   Finally, the State and its amici point to the compelling\ngovernmental interest in combating drunk driving and\ncontend that prompt BAC testing, including through blood\ntesting, is vital to pursuit of that interest. They argue\nthat is particularly so because, in addition to laws that\nmake it illegal to operate a motor vehicle under the influ­\nence of alcohol, all 50 States and the District of Columbia\nhave enacted laws that make it per se unlawful to operate\na motor vehicle with a BAC of over 0.08 percent. See\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Admin. (NHTSA), Al­\ncohol and Highway Safety: A Review of the State of\nKnowledge 167 (No. 811374, Mar. 2011) (NHTSA Re­\nview).8 To enforce these provisions, they reasonably as­\nsert, accurate BAC evidence is critical.

For example, all 50 States have\nadopted implied consent laws that require motorists, as a\ncondition of operating a motor vehicle within the State, to\nconsent to BAC testing if they are arrested or otherwise\ndetained on suspicion of a drunk-driving offense. See\nNHTSA Review 173; supra, at 2 (describing Missouri’s\nimplied consent law). Such laws impose significant conse­\nquences when a motorist withdraws consent; typically the\nmotorist’s driver’s license is immediately suspended or\nrevoked, and most States allow the motorist’s refusal to\ntake a BAC test to be used as evidence against him in a\nsubsequent criminal prosecution. See NHTSA Review\n173–175; see also South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U.

We are aware of no evidence indicating that\nrestrictions on nonconsensual blood testing have compro­\nmised drunk-driving enforcement efforts in the States that\nhave them. And in fact, field studies in States that permit\nnonconsensual blood testing pursuant to a warrant have\nsuggested that, although warrants do impose administra­\ntive burdens, their use can reduce breath-test-refusal\nrates and improve law enforcement’s ability to recover\nBAC evidence.

He testified that he made no effort to obtain\na search warrant before conducting the blood draw even\nthough he was “sure” a prosecuting attorney was on call\nand even though he had no reason to believe that a magis­\ntrate judge would have been unavailable. Id., at 39, 41–\n42. The officer also acknowledged that he had obtained\nsearch warrants before taking blood samples in the past\nwithout difficulty. Id., at 42. He explained that he elected\nto forgo a warrant application in this case only because he\nbelieved it was not legally necessary to obtain a warrant.\nId., at 39–40. Based on this testimony, the trial court\nconcluded that there was no exigency and specifically\nfound that, although the arrest took place in the middle of\nthe night, “a prosecutor was readily available to apply for\na search warrant and a judge was readily available to\nissue a warrant.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.11\n   The Missouri Supreme Court in turn affirmed that\njudgment, holding first that the dissipation of alcohol did\nnot establish a per se exigency, and second that the State\ncould not otherwise satisfy its burden of establishing\nexigent circumstances. 358 S.

See Pet. for Cert. i.\n   Here and in its own courts the State based its case on\nan insistence that a driver who declines to submit to test­\ning after being arrested for driving under the influence of\nalcohol is always subject to a nonconsensual blood test\nwithout any precondition for a warrant. That is incorrect.\n   Although the Missouri Supreme Court referred to this\ncase as “unquestionably a routine DWI case,” 358 S. W.\n3d, at 74, the fact that a particular drunk-driving stop is\n“routine” in the sense that it does not involve “ ‘special\nfacts,’ ” ibid., such as the need for the police to attend to a\ncar accident, does not mean a warrant is required. Other\nfactors present in an ordinary traffic stop, such as the\nprocedures in place for obtaining a warrant or the avail­\nability of a magistrate judge, may affect whether the police\ncan obtain a warrant in an expeditious way and therefore\nmay establish an exigency that permits a warrantless\nsearch. The relevant factors in determining whether a\nwarrantless search is reasonable, including the practical\nproblems of obtaining a warrant within a timeframe that\nstill preserves the opportunity to obtain reliable evidence,\nwill no doubt vary depending upon the circumstances in\nthe case.\n   Because this case was argued on the broad proposition\nthat drunk-driving cases present a per se exigency, the\narguments and the record do not provide the Court with\nan adequate analytic framework for a detailed discussion\nof all the relevant factors that can be taken into account in\ndetermining the reasonableness of acting without a war­\nrant. It suffices to say that the metabolization of alcohol\nin the bloodstream and the ensuing loss of evidence are\namong the factors that must be considered in deciding\nwhether a warrant is required.

I have no quarrel with the Court’s “totality of the\ncircumstances” approach as a general matter; that is what\nour cases require. But the circumstances in drunk driving\ncases are often typical, and the Court should be able to\noffer guidance on how police should handle cases like the\none before us.\n   In my view, the proper rule is straightforward. Our\ncases establish that there is an exigent circumstances\nexception to the warrant requirement. That exception\napplies when there is a compelling need to prevent the\nimminent destruction of important evidence, and there is\nno time to obtain a warrant. The natural dissipation of\nalcohol in the bloodstream constitutes not only the immi-\nnent but ongoing destruction of critical evidence. That\nwould qualify as an exigent circumstance, except that\nthere may be time to secure a warrant before blood can be\ndrawn. If there is, an officer must seek a warrant. If an\nofficer could reasonably conclude that there is not, the\nexigent circumstances exception applies by its terms, and\n2                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nthe blood may be drawn without a warrant.\n                           I\n    The Fourth Amendment provides:\n     “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,\n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\n     searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\n     Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, sup-\n     ported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly de-\n     scribing the place to be searched, and the persons or\n     things to be seized.”\nThat language does not state that warrants are required\nprior to searches, but this Court has long held that war-\nrants must generally be obtained. See Kentucky v. King,\n563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). We have also held\nthat bodily intrusions like blood draws constitute searches\nand are subject to the warrant requirement.               See\nSchmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 767, 770 (1966).\n   However, “the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is ‘reasonableness,’ ” Brigham City v. Stuart,\n547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006), and thus “the warrant require-\nment is subject to certain reasonable exceptions,” King,\n563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). One of those exceptions is\nknown as the “exigent circumstances exception,” which\n“applies when the exigencies of the situation make the\nneeds of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless\nsearch is objectively reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks and altera-\ntions omitted).\n   Within the exigent circumstances exception, we have\nidentified several sets of exigent circumstances excusing\nthe need for a warrant. For example, there is an emergency\naid exception to the warrant requirement. In Brigham\nCity, supra, at 403, we held that “law enforcement officers\nmay enter a home without a warrant to render emergency\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\nassistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant\nfrom imminent injury.” There is also a fire exception to\nthe warrant requirement. In Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S.\n499, 509 (1978), we held that “[a] burning building clearly\npresents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render\na warrantless entry ‘reasonable.’ ” And there is a hot pur-\nsuit exception to the warrant requirement as well. In\nUnited States v. Santana, 427 U. S. 38 (1976), and War-\nden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 (1967), we\nrecognized “the right of police, who had probable cause to\nbelieve that an armed robber had entered a house a few\nminutes before, to make a warrantless entry to arrest the\nrobber and to search for weapons.” Santana, supra, at 42.\nIn each of these cases, the requirement that we base our\ndecision on the “totality of the circumstances” has not\nprevented us from spelling out a general rule for the police\nto follow.\n  The exigency exception most on point here is the one for\nimminent destruction of evidence. We have affirmed on\nseveral occasions that “law enforcement officers may make\na warrantless entry onto private property . . . to prevent\nthe imminent destruction of evidence.” Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403 (citing Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 40\n(1963) (plurality opinion)); see also, e.g., King, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 6). For example, in Ker, the police had\nreason to believe that the defendant was in possession of\nmarijuana and was expecting police pursuit. We upheld\nthe officers’ warrantless entry into the defendant’s home,\nwith the plurality explaining that the drugs “could be\nquickly and easily destroyed” or “distributed or hidden\nbefore a warrant could be obtained at that time of night.”\n374 U. S., at 40, 42.\n  As an overarching principle, we have held that if there\nis a “compelling need for official action and no time to\nsecure a warrant,” the warrant requirement may be ex-\n4                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncused. Tyler, supra, at 509. The question here is whether\nand how this principle applies in the typical case of a\npolice officer stopping a driver on suspicion of drunk\ndriving.\n                                II\n\n                                  \n\n                                A\n\n   The reasonable belief that critical evidence is being\ndestroyed gives rise to a compelling need for blood draws\nin cases like this one. Here, in fact, there is not simply\na belief that any alcohol in the bloodstream will be de-\nstroyed; it is a biological certainty. Alcohol dissipates from\nthe bloodstream at a rate of 0.01 percent to 0.025 percent\nper hour. Stripp, Forensic and Clinical Issues in Alcohol\nAnalysis, in Forensic Chemistry Handbook 440 (L. Kobil-\ninsky ed. 2012). Evidence is literally disappearing by the\nminute. That certainty makes this case an even stronger\none than usual for application of the exigent circumstances\nexception.\n   And that evidence is important. A serious and deadly\ncrime is at issue. According to the Department of Trans-\nportation, in 2011, one person died every 53 minutes due\nto drinking and driving. National Highway Traffic Safety\nAdmin. (NHTSA), Traffic Safety Facts, 2011 Data 1 (No.\n811700, Dec. 2012). No surprise then that drinking and\ndriving is punished severely, including with jail time. See\ngenerally Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, L.\nMaruschak, Special Report, DWI Offenders under Correc-\ntional Supervision (1999). McNeely, for instance, faces up\nto four years in prison. See App. 22–23 (citing Mo. Ann.\nStat. §§558.011, 577.010, 577.023 (West 2011)).\n   Evidence of a driver’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC)\nis crucial to obtain convictions for such crimes.

Most States also have laws establishing addi-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ntional penalties for drivers who drive with a “high BAC,”\noften defined as 0.15 percent or above. NHTSA, Digest\nof Impaired Driving and Selected Beverage Control Laws,\npp. vii, x–xviii (No. 811673, Oct. 2012). BAC evidence\nclearly matters. And when drivers refuse breathalyzers,\nas McNeely did here, a blood draw becomes necessary to\nobtain that evidence.\n   The need to prevent the imminent destruction of BAC\nevidence is no less compelling because the incriminating\nalcohol dissipates over a limited period of time, rather\nthan all at once. As noted, the concentration of alcohol\n can make a difference not only between guilt and inno-\ncence, but between different crimes and different degrees\nof punishment. The officer is unlikely to know precisely\nwhen the suspect consumed alcohol or how much; all he\nknows is that critical evidence is being steadily lost. Fire\ncan spread gradually, but that does not lessen the need\nand right of the officers to respond immediately. See\nTyler, supra.\n   McNeely contends that there is no compelling need for a\nwarrantless blood draw, because if there is some alcohol\nleft in the blood by the time a warrant is obtained, the\nState can use math and science to work backwards and\nidentify a defendant’s BAC at the time he was driving.\nSee Brief for Respondent 44–46. But that’s not good\nenough. We have indicated that exigent circumstances\njustify warrantless entry when drugs are about to be\nflushed down the toilet. See, e.g., King, 563 U. S., at ___–\n___ (slip op., at 7–8). We have not said that, because there\ncould well be drug paraphernalia elsewhere in the home,\nor because a defendant’s co-conspirator might testify to\nthe amount of drugs involved, the drugs themselves are\nnot crucial and there is no compelling need for warrantless\nentry.\n   The same approach should govern here. There is a\n6                       MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\ncompelling need to search because alcohol—the nearly\nconclusive evidence of a serious crime—is dissipating from\nthe bloodstream. The need is no less compelling because\nthe police might be able to acquire second-best evidence\nsome other way.1\n                             B\n  For exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless\nsearch, however, there must also be “no time to secure a\nwarrant.” Tyler, 436 U. S., at 509; see Schmerber, 384\nU. S., at 771 (warrantless search legal when “there was no\ntime to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant”). In\nthis respect, obtaining a blood sample from a suspected\ndrunk driver differs from other exigent circumstances\ncases.\n  Importantly, there is typically delay between the mo-\nment a drunk driver is stopped and the time his blood can\nbe drawn. Drunk drivers often end up in an emergency\nroom, but they are not usually pulled over in front of one.\nIn most exigent circumstances situations, police are just\noutside the door to a home. Inside, evidence is about to be\ndestroyed, a person is about to be injured, or a fire has\nbroken out. Police can enter promptly and must do so to\nrespond effectively to the emergency. But when police pull\na person over on suspicion of drinking and driving, they\ncannot test his blood right away.2 There is a time-\n——————\n    1 Andthat second-best evidence may prove useless. When experts\nhave worked backwards to identify a defendant’s BAC at the time he\nwas driving, defense attorneys have objected to that evidence, courts\nhave at times rejected it, and juries may be suspicious of it. See, e.g., 1\nD. Nichols & F. Whited, Drinking/Driving Litigation §2:9, pp. 2–130 to\n2–137 (2d ed. 2006) (noting counsel objections to such evidence); State\nv.

In this case, for example, approximately 25\nminutes elapsed between the time the police stopped\nMcNeely and the time his blood was drawn. App. 36, 38.\n  As noted, the fact that alcohol dissipates gradually from\nthe bloodstream does not diminish the compelling need for\na search—critical evidence is still disappearing. But the\nfact that the dissipation persists for some time means that\nthe police—although they may not be able to do anything\nabout it right away—may still be able to respond to the\nongoing destruction of evidence later on.\n  There might, therefore, be time to obtain a warrant in\nmany cases. As the Court explains, police can often re-\nquest warrants rather quickly these days. At least 30\nStates provide for electronic warrant applications. See\nante, at 10–12, and n. 4. In many States, a police officer\ncan call a judge, convey the necessary information, and be\nauthorized to affix the judge’s signature to a warrant.\nSee, e.g., Ala. Rule Crim.

If an officer could reasonably con-\nclude that there is not sufficient time to seek and receive a\nwarrant, or he applies for one but does not receive a re-\nsponse before blood can be drawn, a warrantless blood\ndraw may ensue. See Tyler, supra, at 509; see also Illinois\nv. Rodriguez, 497 U.

S. 1, 20 (1968) (“police must,\nwhenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of\nsearches and seizures through the warrant procedure”).\n   Requiring police to apply for a warrant if practicable\nincreases the likelihood that a neutral, detached judicial\nofficer will review the case, helping to ensure that there is\nprobable cause for any search and that any search is\nreasonable. We have already held that forced blood draws\ncan be constitutional—that such searches can be reasonable—\nbut that does not change the fact that they are significant\nbodily intrusions. See Schmerber, 384 U. S., at 770 (up-\nholding a warrantless forced blood draw but noting the\n“importance of informed, detached and deliberate deter-\nminations of the issue whether or not to invade another’s\nbody in search of evidence of guilt” as “indisputable and\ngreat”). Requiring a warrant whenever practicable helps\nensure that when blood draws occur, they are indeed\njustified.\n   At the same time, permitting the police to act without a\nwarrant to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence\nis well established in Fourth Amendment law. There is no\nreason to preclude application of that exception in drunk\ndriving cases simply because it may take the police some\ntime to be able to respond to the undoubted destruction of\nevidence, or because the destruction occurs continuously\nover an uncertain period.\n   And that is so even in situations where police have\nrequested a warrant but do not receive a timely response.\nAn officer who reasonably concluded there was no time to\nsecure a warrant may have blood drawn from a suspect\nupon arrival at a medical facility. There is no reason an\nofficer should be in a worse position, simply because he\nsought a warrant prior to his arrival at the hospital.\n10                 MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                   Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.\n\n                             B\n   The Court resists the foregoing, contending that the\nquestion presented somehow inhibits such a focused anal-\nysis in this case. See ante, at 20–23. It does not. The\nquestion presented is whether a warrantless blood draw is\npermissible under the Fourth Amendment “based upon\nthe natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream.”\nPet. for Cert. i. The majority answers “It depends,” and\nso do I. The difference is that the majority offers no ad-\nditional guidance, merely instructing courts and police\nofficers to consider the totality of the circumstances. I\nbelieve more meaningful guidance can be provided about\nhow to handle the typical cases, and nothing about the\nquestion presented prohibits affording that guidance.\n   A plurality of the Court also expresses concern that my\napproach will discourage state and local efforts to expedite\nthe warrant application process. See ante, at 14. That is\nnot plausible: Police and prosecutors need warrants in a\nwide variety of situations, and often need them quickly.\nThey certainly would not prefer a slower process, just\nbecause that might obviate the need to ask for a warrant\nin the occasional drunk driving case in which a blood draw\nis necessary. The plurality’s suggestion also overlooks the\ninterest of law enforcement in the protection a warrant\nprovides.\n   The Court is correct when it says that every case must\nbe considered on its particular facts. But the pertinent\nfacts in drunk driving cases are often the same, and the\npolice should know how to act in recurring factual situa-\ntions. Simply put, when a drunk driving suspect fails field\nsobriety tests and refuses a breathalyzer, whether a war-\nrant is required for a blood draw should come down to\nwhether there is time to secure one.\n   Schmerber itself provides support for such an analysis.\nThe Court there made much of the fact that “there was no\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Because the body’s natural meta­\nbolization of alcohol inevitably destroys evidence of the\ncrime, it constitutes an exigent circumstance. As a result, I\nwould hold that a warrantless blood draw does not violate\nthe Fourth Amendment.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Fourth Amendment states that “[t]he right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons . . . against unreason­\nable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no\nWarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.” Before a\nsearch occurs, “a warrant must generally be secured,”\nKentucky v. King, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5),\nbut “this presumption may be overcome in some circum­\nstances because ‘[t]he ultimate touchstone of the Fourth\nAmendment is “reasonableness.” ’ ” Ibid. (quoting Brig­\nham City v. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403 (2006); alteration\nin original).\n  The presence of “exigent circumstances” is one such\nexception to the warrant requirement.

MCNEELY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nwhen “ ‘the needs of law enforcement [are] so compelling\nthat [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under\nthe Fourth Amendment.’ ” 563 U.

Thus, when exigent circum­\nstances are present, officers may take actions that would\ntypically require a warrant, such as entering a home in\nhot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. 563 U.

As relevant in this case, officers may also conduct\na warrantless search when they have probable cause to\nbelieve that failure to act would result in “ ‘imminent\ndestruction of evidence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Brigham City,\nsupra, at 403).\n                              B\n   Once police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each\npassing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime.\nThe human liver eliminates alcohol from the bloodstream\nat a rate of approximately 0.015 percent to 0.020 percent\nper hour, ante, at 8, with some heavy drinkers as high as\n0.022 percent per hour, Brief for Petitioner 21 (citing\nmedical studies), depending on, among other things, a per-\nson’s sex, weight, body type, and drinking history.

S. 757, 770 (1966) (“We are told that the\npercentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly\nafter drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate\nit from the system”). In that case, the Court recognized\nthat destruction of evidence is inherent in drunk-driving\ncases and held that an officer investigating a drunk­\ndriving crime “might reasonably [believe] that he [is]\nconfronted with an emergency, in which the delay neces­\nsary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threat­\nen[s] ‘the destruction of evidence.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Preston\nv. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964)). The Court\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

S., at 771. The\nCourt, therefore, held that dissipation of alcohol in the\nblood constitutes an exigency that allows a blood draw\nwithout a warrant.\n   The rapid destruction of evidence acknowledged by the\nparties, the majority, and Schmerber’s exigency determi­\nnation occurs in every situation where police have probable\ncause to arrest a drunk driver. In turn, that destruction\nof evidence implicates the exigent-circumstances doctrine.\nSee Cupp v. Murphy, 412 U. S. 291 (1973). In Cupp,\nofficers questioning a murder suspect observed a spot on\nthe suspect’s finger that they believed might be dried\nblood. Id., at 292. After the suspect began making obvi­\nous efforts to remove the spots from his hands, the officers\ntook samples without obtaining either his consent or a\nwarrant. Id., at 296. Following a Fourth Amendment\nchallenge to this search, the Court held that the “ready\ndestructibility of the evidence” and the suspect’s observed\nefforts to destroy it “justified the police in subjecting him\nto the very limited search necessary to preserve the highly\nevanescent evidence they found under his fingernails.”\nIbid.\n   In this case, a similar exigency is present. Just as the\nsuspect’s efforts to destroy “highly evanescent evidence”\ngave rise to the exigency in Cupp, the natural metaboliza­\ntion of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) creates an exi­\ngency once police have probable cause to believe the driver\n\n——————\n  1 Neither party has challenged this determination, which this Court\nhas reaffirmed several times. See, e.g., Skinner v. Railway Labor\nExecutives’ Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 625 (1989); Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S.\n753, 761–763 (1985).\n4                  MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis drunk. It naturally follows that police may conduct a\nsearch in these circumstances.\n   A hypothetical involving classic exigent circumstances\nfurther illustrates the point. Officers are watching a\nwarehouse and observe a worker carrying bundles from\nthe warehouse to a large bonfire and throwing them into\nthe blaze. The officers have probable cause to believe\nthe bundles contain marijuana. Because there is only one\nperson carrying the bundles, the officers believe it will\ntake hours to completely destroy the drugs. During that\ntime the officers likely could obtain a warrant. But it is\nclear that the officers need not sit idly by and watch the\ndestruction of evidence while they wait for a warrant. The\nfact that it will take time for the evidence to be destroyed\nand that some evidence may remain by the time the offi­\ncers secure a warrant are not relevant to the exigency.\nHowever, the ever-diminishing quantity of drugs may\nhave an impact on the severity of the crime and the\nlength of the sentence. See, e.g., 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(D)\n(lower penalties for less than 50 kilograms of marijuana);\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual\n§2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2012) (drug quantity table tying base\noffense level to drug amounts). Conducting a warrantless\nsearch of the warehouse in this situation would be entirely\nreasonable.\n   The same obtains in the drunk-driving context. Just\nbecause it will take time for the evidence to be completely\ndestroyed does not mean there is no exigency. Congress\nhas conditioned federal highway grants on states’ adoption\nof laws penalizing the operation of a motor vehicle “with a\nblood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or greater.” 23\nU. S.

Moreover, as of 2005, 32\nStates and the District of Columbia imposed additional\npenalties for BAC levels of 0.15 percent or higher. NHTSA\nState Review 175. Missouri is one such State. See, e.g.,\nMo. Stat. Ann. §§577.010(3)–(4), 577.012(4)–(5) (suspended\nsentence unavailable even for first offenders with BAC\nabove 0.15 percent unless they complete drug treatment;\nmandatory jail time if treatment is not completed). As a\nresult, the level of intoxication directly bears on enforce­\nment of these laws. Nothing in the Fourth Amendment\nrequires officers to allow evidence essential to enforcement\nof drunk-driving laws to be destroyed while they wait for a\nwarrant to issue.\n                              II\n  In today’s decision, the Court elides the certainty of\nevidence destruction in drunk-driving cases and focuses\nprimarily on the time necessary for destruction. In doing\nso, it turns the exigency inquiry into a question about the\namount of evidentiary destruction police must permit\nbefore they may act without a warrant. That inquiry is\ninconsistent with the actual exigency at issue: the un­\ncontested destruction of evidence due to metabolization of\nalcohol. See Part I, supra. Moreover, the Court’s facts­\nand-circumstances analysis will be difficult to administer,\na particularly important concern in the Fourth Amend­\nment context.\n  The Court’s judgment reflects nothing more than a\nvague notion that everything will come out right most of\nthe time so long as the delay is not too lengthy. Ante, at\n12 (justifying delays in part because “BAC evidence is lost\ngradually and relatively predictably”); ante, at 10 (same,\nquoting Brief for Petitioner 27). But hard percentage lines\nhave meaningful legal consequences in the drunk-driving\ncontext. The fact that police will be able to retrieve some\n6                   MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nevidence before it is all destroyed is simply not relevant to\nthe exigency inquiry.\n   The majority believes that, absent special facts and\ncircumstances, some destruction of evidence is acceptable.\nSee ante, at 9 (“sufficient for our purposes to note that . . .\nsignificant delay in testing will negatively affect the pro­\nbative value” (emphasis added)). This belief must rest\non the assumption that whatever evidence remains once a\nwarrant is obtained will be sufficient to prosecute the\nsuspect. But that assumption is clearly wrong. Suspects’\ninitial levels of intoxication and the time necessary to\nobtain warranted blood draws will vary widely from case\nto case. Even a slight delay may significantly affect pro­\nbative value in borderline cases of suspects who are mod­\nerately intoxicated or suspects whose BAC is near a statu­\ntory threshold that triggers a more serious offense. See\nsupra, at 4–5 (discussing laws penalizing heightened BAC\nlevels). Similarly, the time to obtain a warrant can be ex­\npected to vary, and there is no reason to believe it will\ndo so in a predictable fashion.\n   Further, the Court nowhere explains how an officer in\nthe field is to apply the facts-and-circumstances test it\nadopts. First, officers do not have the facts needed to\nassess how much time can pass before too little evidence\nremains. They will never know how intoxicated a suspect\nis at the time of arrest. Otherwise, there would be no need\nfor testing. Second, they will not know how long it will\ntake to roust a magistrate from his bed, reach the hospital,\nor obtain a blood sample once there. As the Minnesota\nSupreme Court recognized in rejecting arguments like\nthose adopted by the Court today:\n    “[T]he officer has no control over how long it would\n    take to travel to a judge or the judge’s availability.\n    The officer also may not know the time of the sus­\n    pect’s last drink, the amount of alcohol consumed, or\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Under a totality of the circumstances\n     test, an officer would be called upon to speculate on\n     each of these considerations and predict how long the\n     most probative evidence of the defendant’s blood­\n     alcohol level would continue to exist before a blood\n     sample was no longer reliable.” State v. Shriner, 751\n     N. W. 2d 538, 549 (2008) (footnote omitted).\nThe Court should not adopt a rule that requires police to\nguess whether they will be able to obtain a warrant before\n“too much” evidence is destroyed, for the police lack reli-\nable information concerning the relevant variables.2\n   This case demonstrates the uncertainty officers face\nwith regard to the delay caused by obtaining a warrant.\nThe arresting officer clearly had probable cause to believe\nrespondent was drunk, but there was no way for the of­\nficer to quantify the level of intoxication to determine how\nquickly he needed to act in order to obtain probative evi­\ndence. Another officer testified at respondent’s trial that\nit typically took 1 ½ to 2 hours to obtain a drunk-driving\nwarrant at night in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri.\nSee App. 53–54. Respondent submitted an exhibit sum­\nmarizing six late afternoon and nighttime drunk-driving\nsearch warrants that suggests the time may be shorter.\n——————\n  2 Because the Court’s position is likely to result in delay in obtaining\n\nBAC evidence, it also increases the likelihood that prosecutors will be\nforced to estimate the amount of alcohol in a defendant’s bloodstream\nusing BAC numbers obtained hours later. In practice, this backwards\nextrapolation is likely to devolve into a battle of the experts, as each\nside seeks to show that stale evidence supports its position. There is no\nneed for this outcome. Police facing inevitable destruction situations\nneed not forgo collecting the most accurate available evidence simply\nbecause they might be able to use an expert witness and less persuasive\nevidence to approximate what they lost.\n8                    MISSOURI v. MCNEELY\n\n                       THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nBrief for Respondent 56; App. 70. Ultimately this factual\ntiff is beside the point; the spotty evidence regarding\ntiming itself illustrates the fact that delays in obtaining\nwarrants are unpredictable and potentially lengthy. A\nrule that requires officers (and ultimately courts) to bal­\nance transportation delays, hospital availability, and ac-\ncess to magistrates is not a workable rule for cases where\nnatural processes inevitably destroy the evidence with\nevery passing minute.\n   The availability of telephonic warrant applications is\nnot an answer to this conundrum. See ante, at 10–12,\nand n. 4. For one thing, Missouri still requires written\nwarrant applications and affidavits, Mo. Ann. Stat.\n§§542.276.2(1), 542.276.2.3 (West Supp. 2012), rendering\nthe Court’s 50-State survey irrelevant to the actual dispo­\nsition of this case. Ante, at 11, n. 4. But even if telephonic\napplications were available in Missouri, the same difficul­\nties would arise. As the majority correctly recognizes,\n“[w]arrants inevitably take some time for police officers\nor prosecutors to complete and for magistrate judges to\nreview.” Ante, at 12. During that time, evidence is de­\nstroyed, and police who have probable cause to believe a\ncrime has been committed should not have to guess how\nlong it will take to secure a warrant.\n\n                          *    *    * \n\n    For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. \n\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/858288/", "sha1": "07749da858a436fc1861fed50a8a345af9fe174e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-037", "time_retrieved": "2013-04-17T07:31:10.987349"}
