Argued February 28, 2012—Reargued October 1, 2012—\n                     Decided April 17, 2013\nPetitioners, Nigerian nationals residing in the United States, filed suit\n  in federal court under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging that respond-\n  ents—certain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations—aided and\n  abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law\n  of nations in Nigeria. The ATS provides that “[t]he district courts\n  shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a\n  tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of\n  the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1350. The District Court dismissed\n  several of petitioners’ claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second\n  Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of na-\n  tions does not recognize corporate liability. This Court granted certi-\n  orari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what\n  circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS,\n  for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\n  sovereign other than the United States.\nHeld: The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims un-\n der the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n Pp. 3–14.\n    (a) Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS is a juris-\n dictional statute that creates no causes of action. It permits federal\n courts to “recognize private claims [for a modest number of interna-\n tional law violations] under federal common law.” Sosa v. Alvarez-\n Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 732. In contending that a claim under the\n ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign’s territo-\n2             KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ry, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial ap-\n    plication, which provides that “[w]hen a statute gives no clear indica-\n    tion of an extraterritorial application, it has none,” Morrison v. Na-\n    tional Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. The presumption\n    “serves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and\n    those of other nations which could result in international discord.”\n    EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. It is typically\n    applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct ap-\n    plies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles simi-\n    larly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be\n    brought under the ATS. Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial\n    interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this con-\n    text, where the question is not what Congress has done but what\n    courts may do. These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by\n    the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of ac-\n    tion only for alleged violations of international law norms that are\n    “ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory,” 542 U. S., at 732. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purpos-\n    es of the ATS. Nothing in the ATS’s text evinces a clear indication of\n    extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting\n    aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. And gener-\n    ic terms, like “any” in the phrase “any civil action,” do not rebut the\n    presumption against extraterritoriality. See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at\n    ___. Petitioners also rely on the common-law “transitory torts” doc-\n    trine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has ex-\n    plained, “the only justification for allowing a party to recover when\n    the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-\n    founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,” Cuba R. Co.\n    v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479. The question under Sosa is not wheth-\n    er a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action pro-\n    vided by foreign or even international law. The question is instead\n    whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under\n    U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law. That question is not\n    answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.\n       The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also\n    does not overcome the presumption. When the ATS was passed,\n    “three principal offenses against the law of nations” had been identi-\n    fied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the\n    rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Sosa, supra, at 723, 724. Promi-\n    nent contemporary examples of the first two offenses—immediately\n    before and after passage of the ATS—provide no support for the\n    proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought un-\n    der the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.\n    And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas,\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other\n  country, applying U. S. law to pirates does not typically impose the\n  sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the\n  territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less\n  direct foreign policy consequences. A 1795 opinion of Attorney Gen-\n  eral William Bradford regarding the conduct of U. S. citizens on both\n  the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the\n  ATS’s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the\n  weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritori-\n  ality. Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to\n  make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforce-\n  ment of international norms.

BARINEM KIOBEL, ET AL., PETI-\nTIONERS v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 17, 2013]\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Petitioners, a group of Nigerian nationals residing in\nthe United States, filed suit in federal court against cer-\ntain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations. Petition-\ners sued under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350,\nalleging that the corporations aided and abetted the Nige-\nrian Government in committing violations of the law of\nnations in Nigeria. The question presented is whether\nand under what circumstances courts may recognize a\ncause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations\nof the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\nsovereign other than the United States.\n                             I\n  Petitioners were residents of Ogoniland, an area of 250\nsquare miles located in the Niger delta area of Nigeria and\npopulated by roughly half a million people. When the\ncomplaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum\nCompany and Shell Transport and Trading Company,\np.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Nether-\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlands and England, respectively. Their joint subsidiary,\nrespondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of\nNigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and\nengaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.\nAccording to the complaint, after concerned residents of\nOgoniland began protesting the environmental effects of\nSPDC’s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Gov-\nernment to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstra-\ntions. Throughout the early 1990’s, the complaint alleges,\nNigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni vil-\nlages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and\ndestroying or looting property. Petitioners further allege\nthat respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by,\namong other things, providing the Nigerian forces with\nfood, transportation, and compensation, as well as by al-\nlowing the Nigerian military to use respondents’ property\nas a staging ground for attacks.\n   Following the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to\nthe United States where they have been granted political\nasylum and now reside as legal residents. See Supp. Brief\nfor Petitioners 3, and n. 2. They filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute\nand requesting relief under customary international law.\nThe ATS provides, in full, that “[t]he district courts shall\nhave original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for\na tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or\na treaty of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1350. Accord-\ning to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations\nby aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in com-\nmitting (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against hu-\nmanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary\narrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life,\nliberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7)\nproperty destruction. The District Court dismissed the\nfirst, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a\nviolation of the law of nations. The court denied respond-\nents’ motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining\nclaims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal\npursuant to §1292(b).\n  The Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, rea-\nsoning that the law of nations does not recognize corpo-\nrate liability. 621 F. 3d 111 (2010). We granted certiorari\nto consider that question. 565 U. S. ___ (2011). After oral\nargument, we directed the parties to file supplemen-\ntal briefs addressing an additional question: “Whether\nand under what circumstances the [ATS] allows courts\nto recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). We heard\noral argument again and now affirm the judgment below,\nbased on our answer to the second question.\n                              II\n  Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS was\ninvoked twice in the late 18th century, but then only once\nmore over the next 167 years. Act of Sept. 24, 1789, §9, 1\nStat 77; see Moxon v. The Fanny, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Seafarers’ Int’l\nUnion, 278 F. 2d 49, 51–52 (CA2 1960) (per curiam). The\nstatute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear\ncertain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes\nof action. We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S.\n692, 714 (2004), however, that the First Congress did not\nintend the provision to be “stillborn.” The grant of juris-\ndiction is instead “best read as having been enacted on the\nunderstanding that the common law would provide a\ncause of action for [a] modest number of international law\nviolations.” Id., at 724. We thus held that federal courts\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay “recognize private claims [for such violations] under\nfederal common law.” Id., at 732. The Court in Sosa\nrejected the plaintiff ’s claim in that case for “arbitrary\narrest and detention,” on the ground that it failed to state\na violation of the law of nations with the requisite “defi-\nnite content and acceptance among civilized nations.” Id.,\nat 699, 732.\n   The question here is not whether petitioners have stated\na proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may\nreach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sover-\neign. Respondents contend that claims under the ATS\ndo not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpre-\ntation known as the presumption against extraterritorial\napplication. That canon provides that “[w]hen a statute\ngives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,\nit has none,” Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6), and reflects the\n“presumption that United States law governs domestically\nbut does not rule the world,” Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T\nCorp., 550 U. S. 437, 454 (2007).\n   This presumption “serves to protect against unintended\nclashes between our laws and those of other nations which\ncould result in international discord.” EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco). As\nthis Court has explained:\n    “For us to run interference in . . . a delicate field of\n    international relations there must be present the af-\n    firmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.\n    It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly\n    such an important policy decision where the possibili-\n    ties of international discord are so evident and retali-\n    ative action so certain.” Benz v. Compania Naviera\n    Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957). The pre-\n    sumption against extraterritorial application helps\n    ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    an interpretation of U. S. law that carries foreign pol-\n    icy consequences not clearly intended by the political\n    branches.\n   We typically apply the presumption to discern whether\nan Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.\nSee, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (“These cases present the\nissue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regu-\nlate the employment practices of United States employers\nwho employ United States citizens abroad”); Morrison,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of\nextraterritorial application was a “merits question,” not a\nquestion of jurisdiction). The ATS, on the other hand, is\n“strictly jurisdictional.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 713. It does\nnot directly regulate conduct or afford relief. It instead\nallows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action\nbased on sufficiently definite norms of international law.\nBut we think the principles underlying the canon of inter-\npretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of\naction that may be brought under the ATS.\n   Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference\nin the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context\nof the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has\ndone but instead what courts may do. This Court in Sosa\nrepeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in consid-\nering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in\nlight of foreign policy concerns. As the Court explained,\n“the potential [foreign policy] implications . . . of recog-\nnizing . . . . causes [under the ATS] should make courts\nparticularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign\naffairs.” Id., at 727; see also id., at 727–728 (“Since many\nattempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the viola-\ntion of new norms of international law would raise risks of\nadverse foreign policy consequences, they should be under-\ntaken, if at all, with great caution”); id., at 727 (“[T]he\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npossible collateral consequences of making international\nrules privately actionable argue for judicial caution”).\nThese concerns, which are implicated in any case arising\nunder the ATS, are all the more pressing when the ques-\ntion is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches\nconduct within the territory of another sovereign.\n    These concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa\nlimited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only\nfor alleged violations of international law norms that are\n“ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory.’ ” Id., at 732 (quoting\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)). As demonstrated by Congress’s\nenactment of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,\n106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350, identifying\nsuch a norm is only the beginning of defining a cause of\naction. See id., §3 (providing detailed definitions for extra-\njudicial killing and torture); id., §2 (specifying who may be\nliable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a\nstatute of limitations). Each of these decisions carries\nwith it significant foreign policy implications.\n    The principles underlying the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power\nunder the ATS.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that even if the presumption ap-\nplies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut\nit for causes of action brought under that statute. It is\ntrue that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can\nindicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct\noccurring abroad. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1091(e) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. V) (providing jurisdiction over the offense of geno-\ncide “regardless of where the offense is committed” if\nthe alleged offender is, among other things, “present in the\nUnited States”). But to rebut the presumption, the ATS\nwould need to evince a “clear indication of extraterritorial-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity.” Morrison, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). It does\nnot.\n   To begin, nothing in the text of the statute suggests that\nCongress intended causes of action recognized under it\nto have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by\naliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does\nnot imply extraterritorial reach—such violations affect-\ning aliens can occur either within or outside the United\nStates. Nor does the fact that the text reaches “any civil\naction” suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is\nwell established that generic terms like “any” or “every” do\nnot rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. See,\ne.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14); Small v. United States,\n544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005); Aramco, 499 U. S., at 248–250;\nFoley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 287 (1949).\n   Petitioners make much of the fact that the ATS provides\njurisdiction over civil actions for “torts” in violation of the\nlaw of nations. They claim that in using that word, the\nFirst Congress “necessarily meant to provide for jurisdic-\ntion over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise\non foreign soil.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18. For sup-\nport, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed\ncourts to assume jurisdiction over such “transitory torts,”\nincluding actions for personal injury, arising abroad. See\nMostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, 177, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021,\n1030 (1774) (Mansfield, L.) (“[A]ll actions of a transitory\nnature that arise abroad may be laid as happening in an\nEnglish county”); Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S. 11, 18\n(1881) (“Wherever, by either the common law or the stat-\nute law of a State, a right of action has become fixed and a\nlegal liability incurred, that liability may be enforced and\nthe right of action pursued in any court which has juris-\ndiction of such matters and can obtain jurisdiction of the\nparties”).\n   Under the transitory torts doctrine, however, “the only\njustification for allowing a party to recover when the cause\n8         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well\nfounded belief that it was a cause of action in that place.”\nCuba R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479 (1912) (majority\nopinion of Holmes, J.). The question under Sosa is not\nwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a\ncause of action provided by foreign or even international\nlaw. The question is instead whether the court has au-\nthority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to\nenforce a norm of international law. The reference to\n“tort” does not demonstrate that the First Congress “nec-\nessarily meant” for those causes of action to reach conduct\nin the territory of a foreign sovereign. In the end, nothing\nin the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication\nof extraterritoriality.\n   Nor does the historical background against which the\nATS was enacted overcome the presumption against ap-\nplication to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.\nSee Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting\nthat “[a]ssuredly context can be consulted” in determining\nwhether a cause of action applies abroad). We explained\nin Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, “three prin-\ncipal offenses against the law of nations” had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. 542 U. S., at\n723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 68 (1769). The first two offenses have no\nnecessary extraterritorial application. Indeed, Blackstone—\nin describing them—did so in terms of conduct occur-\nring within the forum nation. See ibid. (describing the\nright of safe conducts for those “who are here”); 1 id.,\nat 251 (1765) (explaining that safe conducts grant a mem-\nber of one society “a right to intrude into another”); id., at\n245–248 (recognizing the king’s power to “receiv[e] ambas-\nsadors at home” and detailing their rights in the state\n“wherein they are appointed to reside”); see also E.

Each concerned the rights of ambas-\nsadors, and each involved conduct within the Union. In\n1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically as-\nsaulted Francis Barbe Marbois—the Secretary of the\nFrench Legion—in Philadelphia. The assault led the\nFrench Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest\nwith the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the\ncountry unless an adequate remedy were provided.\nRespublica v.

See\nCasto, The Federal Courts’ Protective Jurisdiction over\nTorts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18\nConn. L. Rev. 467, 494 (1986). At the request of Secretary\nof Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City\narrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because\n“ ‘neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet\npassed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of\nAmbassadors,’ ” the extent of any available relief would\ndepend on the common law. See Bradley, The Alien Tort\nStatute and Article III, 42 Va. J. Int’l L. 587, 641–642\n(2002) (quoting 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Corre-\nspondence of the United States of America 447 (1837)).\nThe two cases in which the ATS was invoked shortly after\nits passage also concerned conduct within the territory of\nthe United States.

ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore and after passage of the ATS—provide no support\nfor the proposition that Congress expected causes of action\nto be brought under the statute for violations of the law of\nnations occurring abroad.\n   The third example of a violation of the law of nations\nfamiliar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.\nPiracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the terri-\ntorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other coun-\ntry. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (“The offence of piracy,\nby common law, consists of committing those acts of rob-\nbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if com-\nmitted upon land, would have amounted to felony there”).\nThis Court has generally treated the high seas the same\nas foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against\nextraterritorial application. See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian\nCenters Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 173–174 (1993) (de-\nclining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Na-\ntionality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argen-\ntine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.\n428, 440 (1989) (declining to apply a provision of the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).\nPetitioners contend that because Congress surely intended\nthe ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates,\nit necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to con-\nduct occurring abroad.\n   Applying U. S. law to pirates, however, does not typi-\ncally impose the sovereign will of the United States onto\nconduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of\nanother sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign\npolicy consequences. Pirates were fair game wherever\nfound, by any nation, because they generally did not oper-\nate within any jurisdiction. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at\n71. We do not think that the existence of a cause of action\nagainst them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other\ncauses of action under the ATS reach conduct that does\noccur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmay well be a category unto themselves. See Morrison,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (“[W]hen a statute pro-\nvides for some extraterritorial application, the presump-\ntion against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms”); see also Microsoft Corp., 550 U. S.,\nat 455–456.\n   Petitioners also point to a 1795 opinion authored by\nAttorney General William Bradford. See Breach of Neu-\ntrality, 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57. In 1794, in the midst of war\nbetween France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding\nthe American official policy of neutrality, several U. S.\ncitizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and\nplundered the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response\nto a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney Gen-\neral Bradford responded as follows:\n       So far . . . as the transactions complained of origi-\n    nated or took place in a foreign country, they are not\n    within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors\n    be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the\n    United States. But crimes committed on the high\n    seas are within the jurisdiction of the . . . courts of the\n    United States; and, so far as the offence was commit-\n    ted thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be le-\n    gally prosecuted in . . . those courts . . . . But some\n    doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms\n    in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.\n    But there can be no doubt that the company or indi-\n    viduals who have been injured by these acts of hostil-\n    ity have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the\n    United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to\n    these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort\n    only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of\n    the United States . . . .” Id., at 58–59.\n  Petitioners read the last sentence as confirming that\n“the Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to\n12        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw of nations violations committed on the territory of a\nforeign sovereign.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33. Re-\nspondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford\nreferred to “these acts of hostility,” he meant the acts only\ninsofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his\nconclusion were broader, it was only because the applica-\nble treaty had extraterritorial reach. See Supp. Brief for\nRespondents 28–30. The Solicitor General, having once\nread the opinion to stand for the proposition that an “ATS\nsuit could be brought against American citizens for\nbreaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take\nplace in a foreign country,” Supp. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 8, n. 1 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted), now suggests the opinion “could have\nbeen meant to encompass . . . conduct [occurring within\nthe foreign territory],” id., at 8.\n   Attorney General Bradford’s opinion defies a definitive\nreading and we need not adopt one here. Whatever its pre-\ncise meaning, it deals with U. S. citizens who, by partic-\nipating in an attack taking place both on the high seas\nand on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the\nUnited States and Great Britain. The opinion hardly\nsuffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the\npresumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed\nto make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for\nthe enforcement of international norms. As Justice Story\nput it, “No nation has ever yet pretended to be the custos\nmorum of the whole world . . . .” United States v. The La\nJeune Eugenie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274590\"><a href=\"/nc/7wTG/state-v-jeune/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It is implausible to suppose that the First\nCongress wanted their fledgling Republic—struggling to\nreceive international recognition—to be the first. Indeed,\nthe parties offer no evidence that any nation, meek or\nmighty, presumed to do such a thing.\n   The United States was, however, embarrassed by its\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

J.\nInt’l L., at 641. Such offenses against ambassadors vio-\nlated the law of nations, “and if not adequately redressed\ncould rise to an issue of war.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 715; cf.\nThe Federalist No. 80, p. 536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Ham-\nilton) (“As the denial or perversion of justice . . . is with\nreason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow\nthat the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all\ncauses in which the citizens of other countries are con-\ncerned”). The ATS ensured that the United States could\nprovide a forum for adjudicating such incidents. See Sosa,\nsupra, at 715–718, and n. 11. Nothing about this histori-\ncal context suggests that Congress also intended federal\ncommon law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for\nconduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.\n   Indeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing\nsuch a cause of action could have generated it. Recent\nexperience bears this out. See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,\n654 F. 3d 11, 77–78 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\ning in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial\napplications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia,\nPapua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the\nUnited Kingdom). Moreover, accepting petitioners’ view\nwould imply that other nations, also applying the law of\nnations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged\nviolations of the law of nations occurring in the United\nStates, or anywhere else in the world. The presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality guards against our courts trig-\ngering such serious foreign policy consequences, and in-\nstead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the\npolitical branches.\n   We therefore conclude that the presumption against\nextraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and\nthat nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n“[T]here is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here,”\n14        KIOBEL v.

And even where the claims touch\nand concern the territory of the United States, they must\ndo so with sufficient force to displace the presumption\nagainst extraterritorial application.

If Congress were to\ndetermine otherwise, a statute more specific than the ATS\nwould be required.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Other cases may arise\nwith allegations of serious violations of international law\nprinciples protecting persons, cases covered neither by the\nTVPA nor by the reasoning and holding of today’s case;\nand in those disputes the proper implementation of the pre-\nsumption against extraterritorial application may require\nsome further elaboration and explanation.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Specifically, I agree that when\nAlien Tort Statute (ATS) “claims touch and concern the\nterritory of the United States, they must do so with suffi-\ncient force to displace the presumption against extraterri-\ntorial application.” Ante, at 14. This formulation obviously\nleaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom\nin the Court’s preference for this narrow approach. I write\nseparately to set out the broader standard that leads me\nto the conclusion that this case falls within the scope of\nthe presumption.\n   In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), we explained that “the presumption against\nextraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog\nindeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domes-\ntic activity is involved in the case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n17). We also reiterated that a cause of action falls out-\nside the scope of the presumption—and thus is not barred\nby the presumption—only if the event or relationship that\nwas “the ‘focus’ of congressional concern” under the rele-\nvant statute takes place within the United States. Ibid.\n(quoting EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n244, 255 (1991)). For example, because “the focus of the\n[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place\nwhere the deception originated, but upon purchases and\nsales of securities in the United States,” we held in Mor-\nrison that §10(b) of the Exchange Act applies “only” to\n“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,\nand domestic transactions in other securities.” 561 U. S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18).\n   The Court’s decision in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692 (2004), makes clear that when the ATS was\nenacted, “congressional concern” was “ ‘focus[ed],’ ” Morri-\nson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), on the “three principal\noffenses against the law of nations” that had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy, Sosa, 542 U. S.,\nat 723–724. The Court therefore held that “federal courts\nshould not recognize private claims under federal common\nlaw for violations of any international law norm with less\ndefinite content and acceptance among civilized nations\nthan the historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS]\nwas enacted.” Id., at 732. In other words, only conduct\nthat satisfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and ac-\nceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been\n“the ‘focus’ of congressional concern,” Morrison, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 17), when Congress enacted the ATS. As a\nresult, a putative ATS cause of action will fall within the\nscope of the presumption against extraterritoriality—and\nwill therefore be barred—unless the domestic conduct is\nsufficient to violate an international law norm that satis-\nfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and acceptance\namong civilized nations.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

The Court sets forth four key propositions of\nlaw: First, the “presumption against extraterritoriality\napplies to claims under” the Alien Tort Statute. Ante, at\n13. Second, “nothing in the statute rebuts that presump-\ntion.” Ibid. Third, there “is no clear indication of extra-\nterritoria[l application] here,” where “all the relevant\nconduct took place outside the United States” and “where\nthe claims” do not “touch and concern the territory of the\nUnited States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.” Ante, at 13–14 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Fourth, that is in part because “[c]orporations\nare often present in many countries, and it would reach\ntoo far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.” Ante,\nat 14.\n   Unlike the Court, I would not invoke the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. Rather, guided in part by\nprinciples and practices of foreign relations law, I would\nfind jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged\ntort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an Amer-\nican national, or (3) the defendant’s conduct substantially\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand adversely affects an important American national\ninterest, and that includes a distinct interest in prevent-\ning the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of\ncivil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other\ncommon enemy of mankind. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,\n542 U. S. 692, 732 (2004) (“ ‘[F]or purposes of civil liability,\nthe torturer has become—like the pirate and slave trader\nbefore him—hostis humani generis, an enemy of all man-\nkind.’ ” (quoting Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F. 2d 876,\n890 (CA2 1980) (alteration in original))). See also 1 Re-\nstatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United\nStates §§ 402, 403, 404 (1986). In this case, however, the\nparties and relevant conduct lack sufficient ties to the\nUnited States for the ATS to provide jurisdiction.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Our decision in Sosa frames the question. In Sosa the\nCourt specified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), when\nenacted in 1789, “was intended as jurisdictional.” 542\nU. S., at 714. We added that the statute gives today’s\ncourts the power to apply certain “judge-made” damages\nlaw to victims of certain foreign affairs-related miscon-\nduct, including “three specific offenses” to which “Black-\nstone referred,” namely “violation of safe conducts, in-\nfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.” Id.,\nat 715. We held that the statute provides today’s federal\njudges with the power to fashion “a cause of action” for a\n“modest number” of claims, “based on the present-day law\nof nations,” and which “rest on a norm of international\ncharacter accepted by the civilized world and defined with\na specificity comparable to the features” of those three\n“18th-century paradigms.” Id., at 724–725.\n   We further said that, in doing so, a requirement of\n“exhaust[ion]” of “remedies” might apply. Id., at 733,\nn. 21. We noted “a strong argument that federal courts\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshould give serious weight to the Executive Branch’s view\nof the case’s impact on foreign policy.” Ibid. Adjudicating\nany such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with\nthose notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the\nsovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of\nits own laws and their enforcement. Id., at 761 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See\nalso F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542\nU. S. 155, 165–169 (2004).\n   Recognizing that Congress enacted the ATS to permit\nrecovery of damages from pirates and others who violated\nbasic international law norms as understood in 1789, Sosa\nessentially leads today’s judges to ask: Who are today’s\npirates? See 542 U. S., at 724–725 (majority opinion). We\nprovided a framework for answering that question by\nsetting down principles drawn from international norms\nand designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar\nin character and specificity to piracy. Id., at 725.\n   In this case we must decide the extent to which this\njurisdictional statute opens a federal court’s doors to those\nharmed by activities belonging to the limited class that\nSosa set forth when those activities take place abroad. To\nhelp answer this question here, I would refer both to Sosa\nand, as in Sosa, to norms of international law. See Part II,\ninfra.\n                                 B\n   In my view the majority’s effort to answer the question\nby referring to the “presumption against extraterritoriality”\ndoes not work well. That presumption “rests on the per-\nception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect\nto domestic, not foreign matters.” Morrison v. National\nAustralia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n5–6). See ante, at 4. The ATS, however, was enacted with\n“foreign matters” in mind. The statute’s text refers explic-\nitly to “alien[s],” “treat[ies],” and “the law of nations.” 28\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. C. §1350. The statute’s purpose was to address\n“violations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial\nremedy and at the same time threatening serious con-\nsequences in international affairs.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at\n715. And at least one of the three kinds of activities that\nwe found to fall within the statute’s scope, namely piracy,\nibid., normally takes place abroad. See 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).\n   The majority cannot wish this piracy example away by\nemphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas. See\nante, at 10. That is because the robbery and murder that\nmake up piracy do not normally take place in the water;\nthey take place on a ship. And a ship is like land, in that\nit falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it\nflies. See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros\nde Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20–21 (1963); 2 Restatement\n§502, Comment d (“[F]lag state has jurisdiction to pre-\nscribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship”).\nIndeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed piracy as an “offenc[e] against the nation under\nwhose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular\njurisdiction all on board the vessel are.” United States v.\nPalmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85249\"><a href=\"/scotus/rkP/united-states-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632 (1818).

It writes,\n“Applying U. S. law to pirates . . . does not typically im-\npose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another\nsovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy\nconsequences.” Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But, as I\nhave just pointed out, “[a]pplying U. S. law to pirates” does\ntypically involve applying our law to acts taking place\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Nor can\nthe majority’s words “territorial jurisdiction” sensibly dis-\ntinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse\nforeign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of\n1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie\nbombing make all too clear.\n   The majority also writes, “Pirates were fair game wher-\never found, by any nation, because they generally did not\noperate within any jurisdiction.” Ibid. I very much agree\nthat pirates were fair game “wherever found.” Indeed,\nthat is the point. That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are\ntoday’s pirates? Certainly today’s pirates include tortur-\ners and perpetrators of genocide. And today, like the\npirates of old, they are “fair game” where they are found.\nLike those pirates, they are “common enemies of all man-\nkind and all nations have an equal interest in their appre-\nhension and punishment.” 1 Restatement §404 Reporters’\nNote 1, p. 256 (quoting In re Demjanjuk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1576549\"><a href=\"/ohnd/95DT/matter-of-extradition-of-demjanjuk/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n556 (ND Ohio 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nSee Sosa, supra, at 732. And just as a nation that har-\nbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past\ncenturies, see infra, at 8, so harboring “common enemies\nof all mankind” provokes similar concerns today.\n   Thus the Court’s reasoning, as applied to the narrow\nclass of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide signifi-\ncant support for the use of any presumption against extra-\nterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary. See also\nante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this\nCourt has “generally treated the high seas the same as\nforeign soil for purposes of the presumption against extra-\nterritorial application”).\n   In any event, as the Court uses its “presumption against\nextraterritorial application,” it offers only limited help in\ndeciding the question presented, namely “ ‘under what\ncircumstances the Alien Tort Statute . . . allows courts to\nrecognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.’ ” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The ma-\njority echoes in this jurisdictional context Sosa’s warning\nto use “caution” in shaping federal common-law causes of\naction. Ante, at 5. But it also makes clear that a statutory\nclaim might sometimes “touch and concern the territory of\nthe United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.” Ante, at 14. It leaves for another day the\ndetermination of just when the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality might be “overcome.” Ante, at 8.\n                              II\n   In applying the ATS to acts “occurring within the terri-\ntory of a[nother] sovereign,” I would assume that Congress\nintended the statute’s jurisdictional reach to match the\nstatute’s underlying substantive grasp. That grasp, de-\nfined by the statute’s purposes set forth in Sosa, includes\ncompensation for those injured by piracy and its modern-\nday equivalents, at least where allowing such compensa-\ntion avoids “serious” negative international “consequences”\nfor the United States. 542 U. S., at 715. And just as\nwe have looked to established international substantive\nnorms to help determine the statute’s substantive reach,\nid., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional\nnorms to help determine the statute’s jurisdictional\nscope.\n   The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is\nhelpful. Section 402 recognizes that, subject to §403’s “rea-\nsonableness” requirement, a nation may apply its law\n(for example, federal common law, see 542 U. S., at 729–\n730) not only (1) to “conduct” that “takes place [or to per-\nsons or things] within its territory” but also (2) to the\n“activities, interests, status, or relations of its nationals\noutside as well as within its territory,” (3) to “conduct\noutside its territory that has or is intended to have sub-\nstantial effect within its territory,” and (4) to certain\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nforeign “conduct outside its territory . . . that is directed\nagainst the security of the state or against a limited class\nof other state interests.” In addition, §404 of the Restate-\nment explains that a “state has jurisdiction to define and\nprescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by\nthe community of nations as of universal concern, such as\npiracy, slave trade,” and analogous behavior.\n   Considering these jurisdictional norms in light of both\nthe ATS’s basic purpose (to provide compensation for those\ninjured by today’s pirates) and Sosa’s basic caution (to\navoid international friction), I believe that the statute\nprovides jurisdiction where (1) the alleged tort occurs on\nAmerican soil, (2) the defendant is an American national,\nor (3) the defendant’s conduct substantially and adversely\naffects an important American national interest, and that\nincludes a distinct interest in preventing the United\nStates from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as\ncriminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of\nmankind.\n   I would interpret the statute as providing jurisdiction\nonly where distinct American interests are at issue. Doing\nso reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present\nstatute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, “No nation\nha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the\nwhole world.” United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274590\"><a href=\"/nc/7wTG/state-v-jeune/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Further limiting principles such as exhaustion,\nforum non conveniens, and comity would do the same. So\nwould a practice of courts giving weight to the views of the\nExecutive Branch. See Sosa, 542 U. S., at 733, n. 21; id.,\nat 761 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\n   As I have indicated, we should treat this Nation’s interest\nin not becoming a safe harbor for violators of the most fun-\ndamental international norms as an important jurisdiction-\nrelated interest justifying application of the ATS in light of\n8         KIOBEL v.

See generally Leval, The\nLong Arm of International Law: Giving Victims of Human\nRights Abuses Their Day in Court, 92 Foreign Affairs 16\n(Mar. / Apr. 2013). To the contrary, the statute’s language,\nhistory, and purposes suggest that the statute was to be\na weapon in the “war” against those modern pirates who,\nby their conduct, have “declar[ed] war against all mankind.”\n4 Blackstone 71.\n    International norms have long included a duty not to\npermit a nation to become a safe harbor for pirates (or\ntheir equivalent).

In\nFilartiga, 630 F. 2d 876, an alien plaintiff brought a law-\nsuit against an alien defendant for damages suffered\nthrough acts of torture that the defendant allegedly in-\nflicted in a foreign nation, Paraguay. Neither plaintiff nor\ndefendant was an American national and the actions\nunderlying the lawsuit took place abroad. The defendant,\nhowever, “had . . . resided in the United States for more\nthan ninth months” before being sued, having overstayed\nhis visitor’s visa. Id., at 878–879. Jurisdiction was\ndeemed proper because the defendant’s alleged conduct\nviolated a well-established international law norm, and\nthe suit vindicated our Nation’s interest in not providing a\nsafe harbor, free of damages claims, for those defendants\nwho commit such conduct.\n   In Marcos, the plaintiffs were nationals of the Philip-\npines, the defendant was a Philippine national, and the\nalleged wrongful act, death by torture, took place abroad.\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1469, 1475 (CA9 1994); In re Estate of Marcos Hu-\nman Rights Litigation, 978 F. 2d 493, 495–496, 500 (CA9\n1992). A month before being sued, the defendant, “his\nfamily, . . . and others loyal to [him] fled to Hawaii,” where\nthe ATS case was heard. Marcos, 25 F. 3d, at 1469. As in\nFilartiga, the court found ATS jurisdiction.\n10        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   And in Sosa we referred to both cases with approval,\nsuggesting that the ATS allowed a claim for relief in such\ncircumstances. 542 U.

(“Sosa was a case of nonmaritime extra-\nterritorial conduct yet no Justice suggested that therefore\nit couldn’t be maintained”). Not surprisingly, both before\nand after Sosa, courts have consistently rejected the no-\ntion that the ATS is categorically barred from extraterrito-\nrial application. See, e.g., 643 F. 3d, at 1025 (“[N]o court\nto our knowledge has ever held that it doesn’t apply extra-\nterritorially”); Sarei v. Rio Tinto, PLC, 671 F. 3d 736, 747\n(CA9 2011) (en banc) (“We therefore conclude that the ATS\nis not limited to conduct occurring within the United\nStates”); Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11, 20\n(CADC 2011) (“[W]e hold that there is no extraterritoriality\nbar”).\n   Application of the statute in the way I have suggested is\nconsistent with international law and foreign practice.\nNations have long been obliged not to provide safe harbors\nfor their own nationals who commit such serious crimes\nabroad. See E. de Vattel, Law of Nations, Book II, p. 163\n(§76) (“pretty generally observed” practice in “respect to\ngreat crimes, which are equally contrary to the laws and\nsafety of all nations,” that a sovereign should not “suffer\nhis subjects to molest the subjects of other states, or to do\nthem an injury,” but should “compel the transgressor to\nmake reparation for the damage or injury,” or be “deliv-\ner[ed] . . . up to the offended state, to be there brought to\njustice”).\n   Many countries permit foreign plaintiffs to bring suits\nagainst their own nationals based on unlawful conduct\nthat took place abroad.

Cer-\ntain countries, which find “universal” criminal “jurisdic-\ntion” to try perpetrators of particularly heinous crimes\nsuch as piracy and genocide, see Restatement §404, also\npermit private persons injured by that conduct to pursue\n“actions civiles,” seeking civil damages in the criminal\nproceeding.

S. ___\n(2012) (TVPA allows suits against only natural persons).\n  Congress, while aware of the award of civil damages\nunder the ATS—including cases such as Filartiga with\nforeign plaintiffs, defendants, and conduct—has not\nsought to limit the statute’s jurisdictional or substantive\nreach. Rather, Congress has enacted other statutes, and\nnot only criminal statutes, that allow the United States to\nprosecute (or allow victims to obtain damages from) for-\neign persons who injure foreign victims by committing\nabroad torture, genocide, and other heinous acts. See, e.g.,\n18 U. S. C. §2340A(b)(2) (authorizing prosecution of tor-\nturers if “the alleged offender is present in the United\nStates, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or\nalleged offender”); §1091(e)(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V)\n(genocide prosecution authorized when, “regardless of\nwhere the offense is committed, the alleged offender is . . .\npresent in the United States”); note following 28 U. S. C.\n§1350, §2(a) (private right of action on behalf of individu-\nals harmed by an act of torture or extrajudicial killing\ncommitted “under actual or apparent authority, or color of\nlaw, of any foreign nation”). See also S. Rep. No. 102–249,\nsupra, at 3–4 (purpose to “mak[e] sure that torturers and\ndeath squads will no longer have a safe haven in the\nUnited States,” by “providing a civil cause of action in\nU. S. courts for torture committed abroad”).\n  Thus, the jurisdictional approach that I would use is\nanalogous to, and consistent with, the approaches of a\nnumber of other nations. It is consistent with the ap-\nproaches set forth in the Restatement. Its insistence upon\nthe presence of some distinct American interest, its reli-\nance upon courts also invoking other related doctrines\nsuch as comity, exhaustion, and forum non conveniens,\nalong with its dependence (for its workability) upon courts\nobtaining, and paying particular attention to, the views of\n14        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Executive Branch, all should obviate the majority’s\nconcern that our jurisdictional example would lead “other\nnations, also applying the law of nations,” to “hale our\ncitizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of\nnations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else\nin the world.” Ante, at 13.\n   Most importantly, this jurisdictional view is consistent\nwith the substantive view of the statute that we took in\nSosa. This approach would avoid placing the statute’s\njurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives,\nholding out “the word of promise” of compensation for\nvictims of the torturer, while “break[ing] it to the hope.”\n                             III\n   Applying these jurisdictional principles to this case,\nhowever, I agree with the Court that jurisdiction does not\nlie. The defendants are two foreign corporations. Their\nshares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded\non the New York Stock Exchange. Their only presence in\nthe United States consists of an office in New York City\n(actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that\nhelps to explain their business to potential investors. See\nSupp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal\nDutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App.\n55. The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but\nnationals of other nations. The conduct at issue took place\nabroad. And the plaintiffs allege, not that the defendants\ndirectly engaged in acts of torture, genocide, or the equiva-\nlent, but that they helped others (who are not American\nnationals) to do so.\n   Under these circumstances, even if the New York office\nwere a sufficient basis for asserting general jurisdiction,\nbut see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.

It permits federal\n courts to “recognize private claims [for a modest number of interna-\n tional law violations] under federal common law.” Sosa v. Alvarez-\n Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 732.

It is typically\n    applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct ap-\n    plies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles simi-\n    larly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be\n    brought under the ATS. Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial\n    interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this con-\n    text, where the question is not what Congress has done but what\n    courts may do. These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by\n    the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of ac-\n    tion only for alleged violations of international law norms that are\n    “ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory,” 542 U. S., at 732. Pp. 3–6.\n       (b) The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purpos-\n    es of the ATS. Nothing in the ATS’s text evinces a clear indication of\n    extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting\n    aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. And gener-\n    ic terms, like “any” in the phrase “any civil action,” do not rebut the\n    presumption against extraterritoriality. See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at\n    ___. Petitioners also rely on the common-law “transitory torts” doc-\n    trine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has ex-\n    plained, “the only justification for allowing a party to recover when\n    the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-\n    founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,” Cuba R. Co.\n    v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479. The question under Sosa is not wheth-\n    er a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action pro-\n    vided by foreign or even international law. The question is instead\n    whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under\n    U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law. That question is not\n    answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.\n       The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also\n    does not overcome the presumption. When the ATS was passed,\n    “three principal offenses against the law of nations” had been identi-\n    fied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the\n    rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Sosa, supra, at 723, 724. Promi-\n    nent contemporary examples of the first two offenses—immediately\n    before and after passage of the ATS—provide no support for the\n    proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought un-\n    der the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.\n    And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas,\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other\n  country, applying U. S. law to pirates does not typically impose the\n  sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the\n  territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less\n  direct foreign policy consequences. A 1795 opinion of Attorney Gen-\n  eral William Bradford regarding the conduct of U. S. citizens on both\n  the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the\n  ATS’s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the\n  weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritori-\n  ality. Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to\n  make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforce-\n  ment of international norms.

BARINEM KIOBEL, ET AL., PETI-\nTIONERS v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 17, 2013]\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Petitioners, a group of Nigerian nationals residing in\nthe United States, filed suit in federal court against cer-\ntain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations. Petition-\ners sued under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350,\nalleging that the corporations aided and abetted the Nige-\nrian Government in committing violations of the law of\nnations in Nigeria. The question presented is whether\nand under what circumstances courts may recognize a\ncause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations\nof the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\nsovereign other than the United States.\n                             I\n  Petitioners were residents of Ogoniland, an area of 250\nsquare miles located in the Niger delta area of Nigeria and\npopulated by roughly half a million people. When the\ncomplaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum\nCompany and Shell Transport and Trading Company,\np.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Nether-\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlands and England, respectively. Their joint subsidiary,\nrespondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of\nNigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and\nengaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.\nAccording to the complaint, after concerned residents of\nOgoniland began protesting the environmental effects of\nSPDC’s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Gov-\nernment to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstra-\ntions. Throughout the early 1990’s, the complaint alleges,\nNigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni vil-\nlages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and\ndestroying or looting property. Petitioners further allege\nthat respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by,\namong other things, providing the Nigerian forces with\nfood, transportation, and compensation, as well as by al-\nlowing the Nigerian military to use respondents’ property\nas a staging ground for attacks.\n   Following the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to\nthe United States where they have been granted political\nasylum and now reside as legal residents. See Supp. Brief\nfor Petitioners 3, and n. 2. They filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute\nand requesting relief under customary international law.\nThe ATS provides, in full, that “[t]he district courts shall\nhave original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for\na tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or\na treaty of the United States.” 28 U. S. C. §1350. Accord-\ning to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations\nby aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in com-\nmitting (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against hu-\nmanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary\narrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life,\nliberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7)\nproperty destruction. The District Court dismissed the\nfirst, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a\nviolation of the law of nations. The court denied respond-\nents’ motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining\nclaims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal\npursuant to §1292(b).\n  The Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, rea-\nsoning that the law of nations does not recognize corpo-\nrate liability. 621 F. 3d 111 (2010). We granted certiorari\nto consider that question. 565 U. S. ___ (2011). After oral\nargument, we directed the parties to file supplemen-\ntal briefs addressing an additional question: “Whether\nand under what circumstances the [ATS] allows courts\nto recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). We heard\noral argument again and now affirm the judgment below,\nbased on our answer to the second question.\n                              II\n  Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS was\ninvoked twice in the late 18th century, but then only once\nmore over the next 167 years. Act of Sept. 24, 1789, §9, 1\nStat 77; see Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F. Cas. 942 (No.\n9,895) (DC Pa. 1793); Bolchos v. Darrel, 3 F. Cas. 810 (No.\n1,607) (DC SC 1795); O’Reilly de Camara v. Brooke, 209\nU. S. 45 (1908); Khedivial Line, S.A.E. v. Seafarers’ Int’l\nUnion, 278 F. 2d 49, 51–52 (CA2 1960) (per curiam). The\nstatute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear\ncertain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes\nof action. We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S.\n692, 714 (2004), however, that the First Congress did not\nintend the provision to be “stillborn.” The grant of juris-\ndiction is instead “best read as having been enacted on the\nunderstanding that the common law would provide a\ncause of action for [a] modest number of international law\nviolations.” Id., at 724. We thus held that federal courts\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay “recognize private claims [for such violations] under\nfederal common law.” Id., at 732. The Court in Sosa\nrejected the plaintiff ’s claim in that case for “arbitrary\narrest and detention,” on the ground that it failed to state\na violation of the law of nations with the requisite “defi-\nnite content and acceptance among civilized nations.” Id.,\nat 699, 732.\n   The question here is not whether petitioners have stated\na proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may\nreach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sover-\neign. Respondents contend that claims under the ATS\ndo not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpre-\ntation known as the presumption against extraterritorial\napplication. That canon provides that “[w]hen a statute\ngives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,\nit has none,” Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6), and reflects the\n“presumption that United States law governs domestically\nbut does not rule the world,” Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T\nCorp., 550 U. S. 437, 454 (2007).\n   This presumption “serves to protect against unintended\nclashes between our laws and those of other nations which\ncould result in international discord.” EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco). As\nthis Court has explained:\n    “For us to run interference in . . . a delicate field of\n    international relations there must be present the af-\n    firmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.\n    It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly\n    such an important policy decision where the possibili-\n    ties of international discord are so evident and retali-\n    ative action so certain.” Benz v. Compania Naviera\n    Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957). The pre-\n    sumption against extraterritorial application helps\n    ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    an interpretation of U. S. law that carries foreign pol-\n    icy consequences not clearly intended by the political\n    branches.\n   We typically apply the presumption to discern whether\nan Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.\nSee, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (“These cases present the\nissue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regu-\nlate the employment practices of United States employers\nwho employ United States citizens abroad”); Morrison,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of\nextraterritorial application was a “merits question,” not a\nquestion of jurisdiction). The ATS, on the other hand, is\n“strictly jurisdictional.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 713. It does\nnot directly regulate conduct or afford relief. It instead\nallows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action\nbased on sufficiently definite norms of international law.\nBut we think the principles underlying the canon of inter-\npretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of\naction that may be brought under the ATS.\n   Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference\nin the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context\nof the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has\ndone but instead what courts may do. This Court in Sosa\nrepeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in consid-\nering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in\nlight of foreign policy concerns. As the Court explained,\n“the potential [foreign policy] implications . . . of recog-\nnizing . . . . causes [under the ATS] should make courts\nparticularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign\naffairs.” Id., at 727; see also id., at 727–728 (“Since many\nattempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the viola-\ntion of new norms of international law would raise risks of\nadverse foreign policy consequences, they should be under-\ntaken, if at all, with great caution”); id., at 727 (“[T]he\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npossible collateral consequences of making international\nrules privately actionable argue for judicial caution”).\nThese concerns, which are implicated in any case arising\nunder the ATS, are all the more pressing when the ques-\ntion is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches\nconduct within the territory of another sovereign.\n    These concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa\nlimited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only\nfor alleged violations of international law norms that are\n“ ‘specific, universal, and obligatory.’ ” Id., at 732 (quoting\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)). As demonstrated by Congress’s\nenactment of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,\n106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350, identifying\nsuch a norm is only the beginning of defining a cause of\naction. See id., §3 (providing detailed definitions for extra-\njudicial killing and torture); id., §2 (specifying who may be\nliable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a\nstatute of limitations). Each of these decisions carries\nwith it significant foreign policy implications.\n    The principles underlying the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power\nunder the ATS.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that even if the presumption ap-\nplies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut\nit for causes of action brought under that statute. It is\ntrue that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can\nindicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct\noccurring abroad. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1091(e) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. V) (providing jurisdiction over the offense of geno-\ncide “regardless of where the offense is committed” if\nthe alleged offender is, among other things, “present in the\nUnited States”). But to rebut the presumption, the ATS\nwould need to evince a “clear indication of extraterritorial-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity.” Morrison, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). It does\nnot.\n   To begin, nothing in the text of the statute suggests that\nCongress intended causes of action recognized under it\nto have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by\naliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does\nnot imply extraterritorial reach—such violations affect-\ning aliens can occur either within or outside the United\nStates. Nor does the fact that the text reaches “any civil\naction” suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is\nwell established that generic terms like “any” or “every” do\nnot rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. See,\ne.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 13–14); Small v. United States,\n544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005); Aramco, 499 U. S., at 248–250;\nFoley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 287 (1949).\n   Petitioners make much of the fact that the ATS provides\njurisdiction over civil actions for “torts” in violation of the\nlaw of nations. They claim that in using that word, the\nFirst Congress “necessarily meant to provide for jurisdic-\ntion over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise\non foreign soil.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18. For sup-\nport, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed\ncourts to assume jurisdiction over such “transitory torts,”\nincluding actions for personal injury, arising abroad. See\nMostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, 177, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021,\n1030 (1774) (Mansfield, L.) (“[A]ll actions of a transitory\nnature that arise abroad may be laid as happening in an\nEnglish county”); Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U. S. 11, 18\n(1881) (“Wherever, by either the common law or the stat-\nute law of a State, a right of action has become fixed and a\nlegal liability incurred, that liability may be enforced and\nthe right of action pursued in any court which has juris-\ndiction of such matters and can obtain jurisdiction of the\nparties”).\n   Under the transitory torts doctrine, however, “the only\njustification for allowing a party to recover when the cause\n8         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well\nfounded belief that it was a cause of action in that place.”\nCuba R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479 (1912) (majority\nopinion of Holmes, J.). The question under Sosa is not\nwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a\ncause of action provided by foreign or even international\nlaw. The question is instead whether the court has au-\nthority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to\nenforce a norm of international law. The reference to\n“tort” does not demonstrate that the First Congress “nec-\nessarily meant” for those causes of action to reach conduct\nin the territory of a foreign sovereign. In the end, nothing\nin the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication\nof extraterritoriality.\n   Nor does the historical background against which the\nATS was enacted overcome the presumption against ap-\nplication to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.\nSee Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting\nthat “[a]ssuredly context can be consulted” in determining\nwhether a cause of action applies abroad). We explained\nin Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, “three prin-\ncipal offenses against the law of nations” had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. 542 U. S., at\n723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 68 (1769). The first two offenses have no\nnecessary extraterritorial application. Indeed, Blackstone—\nin describing them—did so in terms of conduct occur-\nring within the forum nation. See ibid. (describing the\nright of safe conducts for those “who are here”); 1 id.,\nat 251 (1765) (explaining that safe conducts grant a mem-\nber of one society “a right to intrude into another”); id., at\n245–248 (recognizing the king’s power to “receiv[e] ambas-\nsadors at home” and detailing their rights in the state\n“wherein they are appointed to reside”); see also E. De\nVattel, Law of Nations 465 (J. Chitty et al. transl. and ed.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n1883) (“[O]n his entering the country to which he is sent,\nand making himself known, [the ambassador] is under the\nprotection of the law of nations . . .”).\n   Two notorious episodes involving violations of the law of\nnations occurred in the United States shortly before pas-\nsage of the ATS. Each concerned the rights of ambas-\nsadors, and each involved conduct within the Union. In\n1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically as-\nsaulted Francis Barbe Marbois—the Secretary of the\nFrench Legion—in Philadelphia. The assault led the\nFrench Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest\nwith the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the\ncountry unless an adequate remedy were provided.\nRespublica v. De Longschamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O. T. Phila.\n1784); Sosa, supra, at 716–717, and n. 11. And in 1787,\na New York constable entered the Dutch Ambassador’s\nhouse and arrested one of his domestic servants. See\nCasto, The Federal Courts’ Protective Jurisdiction over\nTorts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18\nConn. L. Rev. 467, 494 (1986). At the request of Secretary\nof Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City\narrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because\n“ ‘neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet\npassed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of\nAmbassadors,’ ” the extent of any available relief would\ndepend on the common law. See Bradley, The Alien Tort\nStatute and Article III, 42 Va. J. Int’l L. 587, 641–642\n(2002) (quoting 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Corre-\nspondence of the United States of America 447 (1837)).\nThe two cases in which the ATS was invoked shortly after\nits passage also concerned conduct within the territory of\nthe United States. See Bolchos, 3 F. Cas. 810 (wrongful\nseizure of slaves from a vessel while in port in the United\nStates); Moxon, 17 F. Cas. 942 (wrongful seizure in United\nStates territorial waters).\n   These prominent contemporary examples—immediately\n10        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore and after passage of the ATS—provide no support\nfor the proposition that Congress expected causes of action\nto be brought under the statute for violations of the law of\nnations occurring abroad.\n   The third example of a violation of the law of nations\nfamiliar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.\nPiracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the terri-\ntorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other coun-\ntry. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (“The offence of piracy,\nby common law, consists of committing those acts of rob-\nbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if com-\nmitted upon land, would have amounted to felony there”).\nThis Court has generally treated the high seas the same\nas foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against\nextraterritorial application. See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian\nCenters Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 173–174 (1993) (de-\nclining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Na-\ntionality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argen-\ntine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.\n428, 440 (1989) (declining to apply a provision of the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).\nPetitioners contend that because Congress surely intended\nthe ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates,\nit necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to con-\nduct occurring abroad.\n   Applying U. S. law to pirates, however, does not typi-\ncally impose the sovereign will of the United States onto\nconduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of\nanother sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign\npolicy consequences. Pirates were fair game wherever\nfound, by any nation, because they generally did not oper-\nate within any jurisdiction. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at\n71. We do not think that the existence of a cause of action\nagainst them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other\ncauses of action under the ATS reach conduct that does\noccur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmay well be a category unto themselves. See Morrison,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (“[W]hen a statute pro-\nvides for some extraterritorial application, the presump-\ntion against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms”); see also Microsoft Corp., 550 U. S.,\nat 455–456.\n   Petitioners also point to a 1795 opinion authored by\nAttorney General William Bradford. See Breach of Neu-\ntrality, 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57. In 1794, in the midst of war\nbetween France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding\nthe American official policy of neutrality, several U. S.\ncitizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and\nplundered the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response\nto a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney Gen-\neral Bradford responded as follows:\n       So far . . . as the transactions complained of origi-\n    nated or took place in a foreign country, they are not\n    within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors\n    be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the\n    United States. But crimes committed on the high\n    seas are within the jurisdiction of the . . . courts of the\n    United States; and, so far as the offence was commit-\n    ted thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be le-\n    gally prosecuted in . . . those courts . . . . But some\n    doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms\n    in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.\n    But there can be no doubt that the company or indi-\n    viduals who have been injured by these acts of hostil-\n    ity have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the\n    United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to\n    these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort\n    only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of\n    the United States . . . .” Id., at 58–59.\n  Petitioners read the last sentence as confirming that\n“the Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to\n12        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw of nations violations committed on the territory of a\nforeign sovereign.” Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33. Re-\nspondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford\nreferred to “these acts of hostility,” he meant the acts only\ninsofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his\nconclusion were broader, it was only because the applica-\nble treaty had extraterritorial reach. See Supp. Brief for\nRespondents 28–30. The Solicitor General, having once\nread the opinion to stand for the proposition that an “ATS\nsuit could be brought against American citizens for\nbreaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take\nplace in a foreign country,” Supp. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 8, n. 1 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted), now suggests the opinion “could have\nbeen meant to encompass . . . conduct [occurring within\nthe foreign territory],” id., at 8.\n   Attorney General Bradford’s opinion defies a definitive\nreading and we need not adopt one here. Whatever its pre-\ncise meaning, it deals with U. S. citizens who, by partic-\nipating in an attack taking place both on the high seas\nand on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the\nUnited States and Great Britain. The opinion hardly\nsuffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the\npresumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed\nto make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for\nthe enforcement of international norms. As Justice Story\nput it, “No nation has ever yet pretended to be the custos\nmorum of the whole world . . . .” United States v. The La\nJeune Eugenie, 26 F. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC.\nMass. 1822). It is implausible to suppose that the First\nCongress wanted their fledgling Republic—struggling to\nreceive international recognition—to be the first. Indeed,\nthe parties offer no evidence that any nation, meek or\nmighty, presumed to do such a thing.\n   The United States was, however, embarrassed by its\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

J.\nInt’l L., at 641. Such offenses against ambassadors vio-\nlated the law of nations, “and if not adequately redressed\ncould rise to an issue of war.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at 715; cf.\nThe Federalist No. 80, p. 536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Ham-\nilton) (“As the denial or perversion of justice . . . is with\nreason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow\nthat the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all\ncauses in which the citizens of other countries are con-\ncerned”). The ATS ensured that the United States could\nprovide a forum for adjudicating such incidents. See Sosa,\nsupra, at 715–718, and n. 11. Nothing about this histori-\ncal context suggests that Congress also intended federal\ncommon law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for\nconduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.\n   Indeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing\nsuch a cause of action could have generated it. Recent\nexperience bears this out. See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,\n654 F. 3d 11, 77–78 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\ning in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial\napplications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia,\nPapua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the\nUnited Kingdom). Moreover, accepting petitioners’ view\nwould imply that other nations, also applying the law of\nnations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged\nviolations of the law of nations occurring in the United\nStates, or anywhere else in the world. The presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality guards against our courts trig-\ngering such serious foreign policy consequences, and in-\nstead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the\npolitical branches.\n   We therefore conclude that the presumption against\nextraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and\nthat nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n“[T]here is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here,”\n14        KIOBEL v.

Specifically, I agree that when\nAlien Tort Statute (ATS) “claims touch and concern the\nterritory of the United States, they must do so with suffi-\ncient force to displace the presumption against extraterri-\ntorial application.” Ante, at 14. This formulation obviously\nleaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom\nin the Court’s preference for this narrow approach. I write\nseparately to set out the broader standard that leads me\nto the conclusion that this case falls within the scope of\nthe presumption.\n   In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S.\n___ (2010), we explained that “the presumption against\nextraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog\nindeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domes-\ntic activity is involved in the case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n17). We also reiterated that a cause of action falls out-\nside the scope of the presumption—and thus is not barred\nby the presumption—only if the event or relationship that\nwas “the ‘focus’ of congressional concern” under the rele-\nvant statute takes place within the United States. Ibid.\n(quoting EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     ALITO, J., concurring\n\n244, 255 (1991)). For example, because “the focus of the\n[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place\nwhere the deception originated, but upon purchases and\nsales of securities in the United States,” we held in Mor-\nrison that §10(b) of the Exchange Act applies “only” to\n“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,\nand domestic transactions in other securities.” 561 U. S.,\nat ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18).\n   The Court’s decision in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\nU. S. 692 (2004), makes clear that when the ATS was\nenacted, “congressional concern” was “ ‘focus[ed],’ ” Morri-\nson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), on the “three principal\noffenses against the law of nations” that had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy, Sosa, 542 U. S.,\nat 723–724. The Court therefore held that “federal courts\nshould not recognize private claims under federal common\nlaw for violations of any international law norm with less\ndefinite content and acceptance among civilized nations\nthan the historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS]\nwas enacted.” Id., at 732. In other words, only conduct\nthat satisfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and ac-\nceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been\n“the ‘focus’ of congressional concern,” Morrison, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 17), when Congress enacted the ATS. As a\nresult, a putative ATS cause of action will fall within the\nscope of the presumption against extraterritoriality—and\nwill therefore be barred—unless the domestic conduct is\nsufficient to violate an international law norm that satis-\nfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and acceptance\namong civilized nations.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

The Court sets forth four key propositions of\nlaw: First, the “presumption against extraterritoriality\napplies to claims under” the Alien Tort Statute. Ante, at\n13. Second, “nothing in the statute rebuts that presump-\ntion.” Ibid. Third, there “is no clear indication of extra-\nterritoria[l application] here,” where “all the relevant\nconduct took place outside the United States” and “where\nthe claims” do not “touch and concern the territory of the\nUnited States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.” Ante, at 13–14 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Fourth, that is in part because “[c]orporations\nare often present in many countries, and it would reach\ntoo far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.” Ante,\nat 14.\n   Unlike the Court, I would not invoke the presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality. Rather, guided in part by\nprinciples and practices of foreign relations law, I would\nfind jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged\ntort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an Amer-\nican national, or (3) the defendant’s conduct substantially\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nand adversely affects an important American national\ninterest, and that includes a distinct interest in prevent-\ning the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of\ncivil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other\ncommon enemy of mankind. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,\n542 U. S. 692, 732 (2004) (“ ‘[F]or purposes of civil liability,\nthe torturer has become—like the pirate and slave trader\nbefore him—hostis humani generis, an enemy of all man-\nkind.’ ” (quoting Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F. 2d 876,\n890 (CA2 1980) (alteration in original))). See also 1 Re-\nstatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United\nStates §§ 402, 403, 404 (1986). In this case, however, the\nparties and relevant conduct lack sufficient ties to the\nUnited States for the ATS to provide jurisdiction.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Our decision in Sosa frames the question. In Sosa the\nCourt specified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), when\nenacted in 1789, “was intended as jurisdictional.” 542\nU. S., at 714. We added that the statute gives today’s\ncourts the power to apply certain “judge-made” damages\nlaw to victims of certain foreign affairs-related miscon-\nduct, including “three specific offenses” to which “Black-\nstone referred,” namely “violation of safe conducts, in-\nfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.” Id.,\nat 715. We held that the statute provides today’s federal\njudges with the power to fashion “a cause of action” for a\n“modest number” of claims, “based on the present-day law\nof nations,” and which “rest on a norm of international\ncharacter accepted by the civilized world and defined with\na specificity comparable to the features” of those three\n“18th-century paradigms.” Id., at 724–725.\n   We further said that, in doing so, a requirement of\n“exhaust[ion]” of “remedies” might apply. Id., at 733,\nn. 21. We noted “a strong argument that federal courts\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshould give serious weight to the Executive Branch’s view\nof the case’s impact on foreign policy.” Ibid. Adjudicating\nany such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with\nthose notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the\nsovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of\nits own laws and their enforcement. Id., at 761 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See\nalso F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542\nU. S. 155, 165–169 (2004).\n   Recognizing that Congress enacted the ATS to permit\nrecovery of damages from pirates and others who violated\nbasic international law norms as understood in 1789, Sosa\nessentially leads today’s judges to ask: Who are today’s\npirates? See 542 U. S., at 724–725 (majority opinion). We\nprovided a framework for answering that question by\nsetting down principles drawn from international norms\nand designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar\nin character and specificity to piracy. Id., at 725.\n   In this case we must decide the extent to which this\njurisdictional statute opens a federal court’s doors to those\nharmed by activities belonging to the limited class that\nSosa set forth when those activities take place abroad. To\nhelp answer this question here, I would refer both to Sosa\nand, as in Sosa, to norms of international law. See Part II,\ninfra.\n                                 B\n   In my view the majority’s effort to answer the question\nby referring to the “presumption against extraterritoriality”\ndoes not work well. That presumption “rests on the per-\nception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect\nto domestic, not foreign matters.” Morrison v. National\nAustralia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n5–6). See ante, at 4. The ATS, however, was enacted with\n“foreign matters” in mind. The statute’s text refers explic-\nitly to “alien[s],” “treat[ies],” and “the law of nations.” 28\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. C. §1350. The statute’s purpose was to address\n“violations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial\nremedy and at the same time threatening serious con-\nsequences in international affairs.” Sosa, 542 U. S., at\n715. And at least one of the three kinds of activities that\nwe found to fall within the statute’s scope, namely piracy,\nibid., normally takes place abroad. See 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).\n   The majority cannot wish this piracy example away by\nemphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas. See\nante, at 10. That is because the robbery and murder that\nmake up piracy do not normally take place in the water;\nthey take place on a ship. And a ship is like land, in that\nit falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it\nflies. See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros\nde Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20–21 (1963); 2 Restatement\n§502, Comment d (“[F]lag state has jurisdiction to pre-\nscribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship”).\nIndeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed piracy as an “offenc[e] against the nation under\nwhose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular\njurisdiction all on board the vessel are.” United States v.\nPalmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 632 (1818). See United States v.\nFurlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197 (1820) (a crime committed\n“within the jurisdiction” of a foreign state and a crime\ncommitted “in the vessel of another nation” are “the same\nthing”).\n   The majority nonetheless tries to find a distinction\nbetween piracy at sea and similar cases on land. It writes,\n“Applying U. S. law to pirates . . . does not typically im-\npose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another\nsovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy\nconsequences.” Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But, as I\nhave just pointed out, “[a]pplying U. S. law to pirates” does\ntypically involve applying our law to acts taking place\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of another sovereign. Nor can\nthe majority’s words “territorial jurisdiction” sensibly dis-\ntinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse\nforeign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of\n1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie\nbombing make all too clear.\n   The majority also writes, “Pirates were fair game wher-\never found, by any nation, because they generally did not\noperate within any jurisdiction.” Ibid. I very much agree\nthat pirates were fair game “wherever found.” Indeed,\nthat is the point. That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are\ntoday’s pirates? Certainly today’s pirates include tortur-\ners and perpetrators of genocide. And today, like the\npirates of old, they are “fair game” where they are found.\nLike those pirates, they are “common enemies of all man-\nkind and all nations have an equal interest in their appre-\nhension and punishment.” 1 Restatement §404 Reporters’\nNote 1, p. 256 (quoting In re Demjanjuk, 612 F. Supp. 544,\n556 (ND Ohio 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nSee Sosa, supra, at 732. And just as a nation that har-\nbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past\ncenturies, see infra, at 8, so harboring “common enemies\nof all mankind” provokes similar concerns today.\n   Thus the Court’s reasoning, as applied to the narrow\nclass of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide signifi-\ncant support for the use of any presumption against extra-\nterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary. See also\nante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this\nCourt has “generally treated the high seas the same as\nforeign soil for purposes of the presumption against extra-\nterritorial application”).\n   In any event, as the Court uses its “presumption against\nextraterritorial application,” it offers only limited help in\ndeciding the question presented, namely “ ‘under what\ncircumstances the Alien Tort Statute . . . allows courts to\nrecognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.’ ” 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The ma-\njority echoes in this jurisdictional context Sosa’s warning\nto use “caution” in shaping federal common-law causes of\naction. Ante, at 5. But it also makes clear that a statutory\nclaim might sometimes “touch and concern the territory of\nthe United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.” Ante, at 14. It leaves for another day the\ndetermination of just when the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality might be “overcome.” Ante, at 8.\n                              II\n   In applying the ATS to acts “occurring within the terri-\ntory of a[nother] sovereign,” I would assume that Congress\nintended the statute’s jurisdictional reach to match the\nstatute’s underlying substantive grasp. That grasp, de-\nfined by the statute’s purposes set forth in Sosa, includes\ncompensation for those injured by piracy and its modern-\nday equivalents, at least where allowing such compensa-\ntion avoids “serious” negative international “consequences”\nfor the United States. 542 U. S., at 715. And just as\nwe have looked to established international substantive\nnorms to help determine the statute’s substantive reach,\nid., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional\nnorms to help determine the statute’s jurisdictional\nscope.\n   The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is\nhelpful. Section 402 recognizes that, subject to §403’s “rea-\nsonableness” requirement, a nation may apply its law\n(for example, federal common law, see 542 U. S., at 729–\n730) not only (1) to “conduct” that “takes place [or to per-\nsons or things] within its territory” but also (2) to the\n“activities, interests, status, or relations of its nationals\noutside as well as within its territory,” (3) to “conduct\noutside its territory that has or is intended to have sub-\nstantial effect within its territory,” and (4) to certain\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nforeign “conduct outside its territory . . . that is directed\nagainst the security of the state or against a limited class\nof other state interests.” In addition, §404 of the Restate-\nment explains that a “state has jurisdiction to define and\nprescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by\nthe community of nations as of universal concern, such as\npiracy, slave trade,” and analogous behavior.\n   Considering these jurisdictional norms in light of both\nthe ATS’s basic purpose (to provide compensation for those\ninjured by today’s pirates) and Sosa’s basic caution (to\navoid international friction), I believe that the statute\nprovides jurisdiction where (1) the alleged tort occurs on\nAmerican soil, (2) the defendant is an American national,\nor (3) the defendant’s conduct substantially and adversely\naffects an important American national interest, and that\nincludes a distinct interest in preventing the United\nStates from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as\ncriminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of\nmankind.\n   I would interpret the statute as providing jurisdiction\nonly where distinct American interests are at issue. Doing\nso reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present\nstatute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, “No nation\nha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the\nwhole world.” United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, 26\nF. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC Mass. 1822). That re-\nstriction also should help to minimize international fric-\ntion. Further limiting principles such as exhaustion,\nforum non conveniens, and comity would do the same. So\nwould a practice of courts giving weight to the views of the\nExecutive Branch. See Sosa, 542 U.

ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe statute’s basic purposes—in particular that of compen-\nsating those who have suffered harm at the hands of, e.g.,\ntorturers or other modern pirates. Nothing in the statute or\nits history suggests that our courts should turn a blind eye to\nthe plight of victims in that “handful of heinous actions.”\nTel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 781 (CADC\n1984) (Edwards, J., concurring). See generally Leval, The\nLong Arm of International Law: Giving Victims of Human\nRights Abuses Their Day in Court, 92 Foreign Affairs 16\n(Mar. / Apr. 2013). To the contrary, the statute’s language,\nhistory, and purposes suggest that the statute was to be\na weapon in the “war” against those modern pirates who,\nby their conduct, have “declar[ed] war against all mankind.”\n4 Blackstone 71.\n    International norms have long included a duty not to\npermit a nation to become a safe harbor for pirates (or\ntheir equivalent). See generally A.

In\nFilartiga, 630 F. 2d 876, an alien plaintiff brought a law-\nsuit against an alien defendant for damages suffered\nthrough acts of torture that the defendant allegedly in-\nflicted in a foreign nation, Paraguay. Neither plaintiff nor\ndefendant was an American national and the actions\nunderlying the lawsuit took place abroad. The defendant,\nhowever, “had . . . resided in the United States for more\nthan ninth months” before being sued, having overstayed\nhis visitor’s visa. Id., at 878–879. Jurisdiction was\ndeemed proper because the defendant’s alleged conduct\nviolated a well-established international law norm, and\nthe suit vindicated our Nation’s interest in not providing a\nsafe harbor, free of damages claims, for those defendants\nwho commit such conduct.\n   In Marcos, the plaintiffs were nationals of the Philip-\npines, the defendant was a Philippine national, and the\nalleged wrongful act, death by torture, took place abroad.\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1469, 1475 (CA9 1994); In re Estate of Marcos Hu-\nman Rights Litigation, 978 F. 2d 493, 495–496, 500 (CA9\n1992). A month before being sued, the defendant, “his\nfamily, . . . and others loyal to [him] fled to Hawaii,” where\nthe ATS case was heard. Marcos, 25 F. 3d, at 1469. As in\nFilartiga, the court found ATS jurisdiction.\n10        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   And in Sosa we referred to both cases with approval,\nsuggesting that the ATS allowed a claim for relief in such\ncircumstances. 542 U. S., at 732. See also Flomo v. Fire-\nstone Natural Rubber Co., 643 F. 3d 1013, 1025 (CA7\n2011) (Posner, J.) (“Sosa was a case of nonmaritime extra-\nterritorial conduct yet no Justice suggested that therefore\nit couldn’t be maintained”). Not surprisingly, both before\nand after Sosa, courts have consistently rejected the no-\ntion that the ATS is categorically barred from extraterrito-\nrial application. See, e.g., 643 F. 3d, at 1025 (“[N]o court\nto our knowledge has ever held that it doesn’t apply extra-\nterritorially”); Sarei v. Rio Tinto, PLC, 671 F. 3d 736, 747\n(CA9 2011) (en banc) (“We therefore conclude that the ATS\nis not limited to conduct occurring within the United\nStates”); Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F. 3d 11, 20\n(CADC 2011) (“[W]e hold that there is no extraterritoriality\nbar”).\n   Application of the statute in the way I have suggested is\nconsistent with international law and foreign practice.\nNations have long been obliged not to provide safe harbors\nfor their own nationals who commit such serious crimes\nabroad. See E. de Vattel, Law of Nations, Book II, p. 163\n(§76) (“pretty generally observed” practice in “respect to\ngreat crimes, which are equally contrary to the laws and\nsafety of all nations,” that a sovereign should not “suffer\nhis subjects to molest the subjects of other states, or to do\nthem an injury,” but should “compel the transgressor to\nmake reparation for the damage or injury,” or be “deliv-\ner[ed] . . . up to the offended state, to be there brought to\njustice”).\n   Many countries permit foreign plaintiffs to bring suits\nagainst their own nationals based on unlawful conduct\nthat took place abroad.

Cer-\ntain countries, which find “universal” criminal “jurisdic-\ntion” to try perpetrators of particularly heinous crimes\nsuch as piracy and genocide, see Restatement §404, also\npermit private persons injured by that conduct to pursue\n“actions civiles,” seeking civil damages in the criminal\nproceeding.

Int’l & Comp.\nL. 451, 468–470 (2011).

S. ___\n(2012) (TVPA allows suits against only natural persons).\n  Congress, while aware of the award of civil damages\nunder the ATS—including cases such as Filartiga with\nforeign plaintiffs, defendants, and conduct—has not\nsought to limit the statute’s jurisdictional or substantive\nreach. Rather, Congress has enacted other statutes, and\nnot only criminal statutes, that allow the United States to\nprosecute (or allow victims to obtain damages from) for-\neign persons who injure foreign victims by committing\nabroad torture, genocide, and other heinous acts. See, e.g.,\n18 U. S. C. §2340A(b)(2) (authorizing prosecution of tor-\nturers if “the alleged offender is present in the United\nStates, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or\nalleged offender”); §1091(e)(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V)\n(genocide prosecution authorized when, “regardless of\nwhere the offense is committed, the alleged offender is . . .\npresent in the United States”); note following 28 U. S. C.\n§1350, §2(a) (private right of action on behalf of individu-\nals harmed by an act of torture or extrajudicial killing\ncommitted “under actual or apparent authority, or color of\nlaw, of any foreign nation”). See also S. Rep. No. 102–249,\nsupra, at 3–4 (purpose to “mak[e] sure that torturers and\ndeath squads will no longer have a safe haven in the\nUnited States,” by “providing a civil cause of action in\nU. S. courts for torture committed abroad”).\n  Thus, the jurisdictional approach that I would use is\nanalogous to, and consistent with, the approaches of a\nnumber of other nations. It is consistent with the ap-\nproaches set forth in the Restatement. Its insistence upon\nthe presence of some distinct American interest, its reli-\nance upon courts also invoking other related doctrines\nsuch as comity, exhaustion, and forum non conveniens,\nalong with its dependence (for its workability) upon courts\nobtaining, and paying particular attention to, the views of\n14        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Executive Branch, all should obviate the majority’s\nconcern that our jurisdictional example would lead “other\nnations, also applying the law of nations,” to “hale our\ncitizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of\nnations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else\nin the world.” Ante, at 13.\n   Most importantly, this jurisdictional view is consistent\nwith the substantive view of the statute that we took in\nSosa. This approach would avoid placing the statute’s\njurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives,\nholding out “the word of promise” of compensation for\nvictims of the torturer, while “break[ing] it to the hope.”\n                             III\n   Applying these jurisdictional principles to this case,\nhowever, I agree with the Court that jurisdiction does not\nlie. The defendants are two foreign corporations. Their\nshares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded\non the New York Stock Exchange. Their only presence in\nthe United States consists of an office in New York City\n(actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that\nhelps to explain their business to potential investors. See\nSupp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal\nDutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App.\n55. The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but\nnationals of other nations. The conduct at issue took place\nabroad. And the plaintiffs allege, not that the defendants\ndirectly engaged in acts of torture, genocide, or the equiva-\nlent, but that they helped others (who are not American\nnationals) to do so.\n   Under these circumstances, even if the New York office\nwere a sufficient basis for asserting general jurisdiction,\nbut see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), it would be farfetched to believe,\nbased solely upon the defendants’ minimal and indirect\nAmerican presence, that this legal action helps to vindi-\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
