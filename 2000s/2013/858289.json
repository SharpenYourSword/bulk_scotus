Argued February 28, 2012\u2014Reargued October 1, 2012\u2014\n                     Decided April 17, 2013\nPetitioners, Nigerian nationals residing in the United States, filed suit\n  in federal court under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging that respond-\n  ents\u2014certain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations\u2014aided and\n  abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law\n  of nations in Nigeria. The ATS provides that \u201c[t]he district courts\n  shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a\n  tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of\n  the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350. The District Court dismissed\n  several of petitioners\u2019 claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second\n  Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of na-\n  tions does not recognize corporate liability. This Court granted certi-\n  orari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what\n  circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS,\n  for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\n  sovereign other than the United States.\nHeld: The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims un-\n der the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n Pp. 3\u201314.\n    (a) Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS is a juris-\n dictional statute that creates no causes of action. It permits federal\n courts to \u201crecognize private claims [for a modest number of interna-\n tional law violations] under federal common law.\u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-\n Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 732. In contending that a claim under the\n ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign\u2019s territo-\n2             KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ry, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial ap-\n    plication, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indica-\n    tion of an extraterritorial application, it has none,\u201d Morrison v. Na-\n    tional Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. The presumption\n    \u201cserves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and\n    those of other nations which could result in international discord.\u201d\n    EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. It is typically\n    applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct ap-\n    plies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles simi-\n    larly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be\n    brought under the ATS. Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial\n    interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this con-\n    text, where the question is not what Congress has done but what\n    courts may do. These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by\n    the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of ac-\n    tion only for alleged violations of international law norms that are\n    \u201c \u2018specific, universal, and obligatory,\u201d 542 U. S., at 732. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purpos-\n    es of the ATS. Nothing in the ATS\u2019s text evinces a clear indication of\n    extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting\n    aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. And gener-\n    ic terms, like \u201cany\u201d in the phrase \u201cany civil action,\u201d do not rebut the\n    presumption against extraterritoriality. See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at\n    ___. Petitioners also rely on the common-law \u201ctransitory torts\u201d doc-\n    trine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has ex-\n    plained, \u201cthe only justification for allowing a party to recover when\n    the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-\n    founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,\u201d Cuba R. Co.\n    v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479. The question under Sosa is not wheth-\n    er a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action pro-\n    vided by foreign or even international law. The question is instead\n    whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under\n    U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law. That question is not\n    answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.\n       The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also\n    does not overcome the presumption. When the ATS was passed,\n    \u201cthree principal offenses against the law of nations\u201d had been identi-\n    fied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the\n    rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Sosa, supra, at 723, 724. Promi-\n    nent contemporary examples of the first two offenses\u2014immediately\n    before and after passage of the ATS\u2014provide no support for the\n    proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought un-\n    der the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.\n    And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas,\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other\n  country, applying U. S. law to pirates does not typically impose the\n  sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the\n  territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less\n  direct foreign policy consequences. A 1795 opinion of Attorney Gen-\n  eral William Bradford regarding the conduct of U. S. citizens on both\n  the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the\n  ATS\u2019s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the\n  weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritori-\n  ality. Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to\n  make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforce-\n  ment of international norms.

BARINEM KIOBEL, ET AL., PETI-\nTIONERS v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                 [April 17, 2013]\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  Petitioners, a group of Nigerian nationals residing in\nthe United States, filed suit in federal court against cer-\ntain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations. Petition-\ners sued under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350,\nalleging that the corporations aided and abetted the Nige-\nrian Government in committing violations of the law of\nnations in Nigeria. The question presented is whether\nand under what circumstances courts may recognize a\ncause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations\nof the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\nsovereign other than the United States.\n                             I\n  Petitioners were residents of Ogoniland, an area of 250\nsquare miles located in the Niger delta area of Nigeria and\npopulated by roughly half a million people. When the\ncomplaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum\nCompany and Shell Transport and Trading Company,\np.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Nether-\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlands and England, respectively. Their joint subsidiary,\nrespondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of\nNigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and\nengaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.\nAccording to the complaint, after concerned residents of\nOgoniland began protesting the environmental effects of\nSPDC\u2019s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Gov-\nernment to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstra-\ntions. Throughout the early 1990\u2019s, the complaint alleges,\nNigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni vil-\nlages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and\ndestroying or looting property. Petitioners further allege\nthat respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by,\namong other things, providing the Nigerian forces with\nfood, transportation, and compensation, as well as by al-\nlowing the Nigerian military to use respondents\u2019 property\nas a staging ground for attacks.\n   Following the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to\nthe United States where they have been granted political\nasylum and now reside as legal residents. See Supp. Brief\nfor Petitioners 3, and n. 2. They filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute\nand requesting relief under customary international law.\nThe ATS provides, in full, that \u201c[t]he district courts shall\nhave original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for\na tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or\na treaty of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350. Accord-\ning to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations\nby aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in com-\nmitting (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against hu-\nmanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary\narrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life,\nliberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7)\nproperty destruction. The District Court dismissed the\nfirst, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a\nviolation of the law of nations. The court denied respond-\nents\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining\nclaims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal\npursuant to \u00a71292(b).\n  The Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, rea-\nsoning that the law of nations does not recognize corpo-\nrate liability. 621 F. 3d 111 (2010). We granted certiorari\nto consider that question. 565 U. S. ___ (2011). After oral\nargument, we directed the parties to file supplemen-\ntal briefs addressing an additional question: \u201cWhether\nand under what circumstances the [ATS] allows courts\nto recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.\u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2012). We heard\noral argument again and now affirm the judgment below,\nbased on our answer to the second question.\n                              II\n  Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS was\ninvoked twice in the late 18th century, but then only once\nmore over the next 167 years. Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a79, 1\nStat 77; see Moxon v. The Fanny, 17 F. Cas. 942 (No.\n9,895) (DC Pa. 1793); Bolchos v. Darrel, 3 F. Cas. 810 (No.\n1,607) (DC SC 1795); O\u2019Reilly de Camara v. Brooke, 209\nU. S. 45 (1908); Khedivial Line, S.A.E. v. Seafarers\u2019 Int\u2019l\nUnion, 278 F. 2d 49, 51\u201352 (CA2 1960) (per curiam). The\nstatute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear\ncertain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes\nof action. We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S.\n692, 714 (2004), however, that the First Congress did not\nintend the provision to be \u201cstillborn.\u201d The grant of juris-\ndiction is instead \u201cbest read as having been enacted on the\nunderstanding that the common law would provide a\ncause of action for [a] modest number of international law\nviolations.\u201d Id., at 724. We thus held that federal courts\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay \u201crecognize private claims [for such violations] under\nfederal common law.\u201d Id., at 732. The Court in Sosa\nrejected the plaintiff \u2019s claim in that case for \u201carbitrary\narrest and detention,\u201d on the ground that it failed to state\na violation of the law of nations with the requisite \u201cdefi-\nnite content and acceptance among civilized nations.\u201d Id.,\nat 699, 732.\n   The question here is not whether petitioners have stated\na proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may\nreach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sover-\neign. Respondents contend that claims under the ATS\ndo not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpre-\ntation known as the presumption against extraterritorial\napplication. That canon provides that \u201c[w]hen a statute\ngives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,\nit has none,\u201d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6), and reflects the\n\u201cpresumption that United States law governs domestically\nbut does not rule the world,\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T\nCorp., 550 U. S. 437, 454 (2007).\n   This presumption \u201cserves to protect against unintended\nclashes between our laws and those of other nations which\ncould result in international discord.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco). As\nthis Court has explained:\n    \u201cFor us to run interference in . . . a delicate field of\n    international relations there must be present the af-\n    firmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.\n    It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly\n    such an important policy decision where the possibili-\n    ties of international discord are so evident and retali-\n    ative action so certain.\u201d Benz v. Compania Naviera\n    Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957). The pre-\n    sumption against extraterritorial application helps\n    ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    an interpretation of U. S. law that carries foreign pol-\n    icy consequences not clearly intended by the political\n    branches.\n   We typically apply the presumption to discern whether\nan Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.\nSee, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (\u201cThese cases present the\nissue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regu-\nlate the employment practices of United States employers\nwho employ United States citizens abroad\u201d); Morrison,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of\nextraterritorial application was a \u201cmerits question,\u201d not a\nquestion of jurisdiction). The ATS, on the other hand, is\n\u201cstrictly jurisdictional.\u201d Sosa, 542 U. S., at 713. It does\nnot directly regulate conduct or afford relief. It instead\nallows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action\nbased on sufficiently definite norms of international law.\nBut we think the principles underlying the canon of inter-\npretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of\naction that may be brought under the ATS.\n   Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference\nin the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context\nof the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has\ndone but instead what courts may do. This Court in Sosa\nrepeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in consid-\nering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in\nlight of foreign policy concerns. As the Court explained,\n\u201cthe potential [foreign policy] implications . . . of recog-\nnizing . . . . causes [under the ATS] should make courts\nparticularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign\naffairs.\u201d Id., at 727; see also id., at 727\u2013728 (\u201cSince many\nattempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the viola-\ntion of new norms of international law would raise risks of\nadverse foreign policy consequences, they should be under-\ntaken, if at all, with great caution\u201d); id., at 727 (\u201c[T]he\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npossible collateral consequences of making international\nrules privately actionable argue for judicial caution\u201d).\nThese concerns, which are implicated in any case arising\nunder the ATS, are all the more pressing when the ques-\ntion is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches\nconduct within the territory of another sovereign.\n    These concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa\nlimited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only\nfor alleged violations of international law norms that are\n\u201c \u2018specific, universal, and obligatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 732 (quoting\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)). As demonstrated by Congress\u2019s\nenactment of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,\n106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, identifying\nsuch a norm is only the beginning of defining a cause of\naction. See id., \u00a73 (providing detailed definitions for extra-\njudicial killing and torture); id., \u00a72 (specifying who may be\nliable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a\nstatute of limitations). Each of these decisions carries\nwith it significant foreign policy implications.\n    The principles underlying the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power\nunder the ATS.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that even if the presumption ap-\nplies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut\nit for causes of action brought under that statute. It is\ntrue that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can\nindicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct\noccurring abroad. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. \u00a71091(e) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. V) (providing jurisdiction over the offense of geno-\ncide \u201cregardless of where the offense is committed\u201d if\nthe alleged offender is, among other things, \u201cpresent in the\nUnited States\u201d). But to rebut the presumption, the ATS\nwould need to evince a \u201cclear indication of extraterritorial-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nity.\u201d Morrison, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). It does\nnot.\n   To begin, nothing in the text of the statute suggests that\nCongress intended causes of action recognized under it\nto have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by\naliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does\nnot imply extraterritorial reach\u2014such violations affect-\ning aliens can occur either within or outside the United\nStates. Nor does the fact that the text reaches \u201cany civil\naction\u201d suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is\nwell established that generic terms like \u201cany\u201d or \u201cevery\u201d do\nnot rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. See,\ne.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 13\u201314); Small v. United States,\n544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005); Aramco, 499 U. S., at 248\u2013250;\nFoley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 287 (1949).\n   Petitioners make much of the fact that the ATS provides\njurisdiction over civil actions for \u201ctorts\u201d in violation of the\nlaw of nations. They claim that in using that word, the\nFirst Congress \u201cnecessarily meant to provide for jurisdic-\ntion over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise\non foreign soil.\u201d Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18. For sup-\nport, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed\ncourts to assume jurisdiction over such \u201ctransitory torts,\u201d\nincluding actions for personal injury, arising abroad. See\nMostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, 177, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021,\n1030 (1774) (Mansfield, L.) (\u201c[A]ll actions of a transitory\nnature that arise abroad may be laid as happening in an\nEnglish county\u201d); Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U.

Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479 (1912) (majority\nopinion of Holmes, J.). The question under Sosa is not\nwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a\ncause of action provided by foreign or even international\nlaw. The question is instead whether the court has au-\nthority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to\nenforce a norm of international law. The reference to\n\u201ctort\u201d does not demonstrate that the First Congress \u201cnec-\nessarily meant\u201d for those causes of action to reach conduct\nin the territory of a foreign sovereign. In the end, nothing\nin the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication\nof extraterritoriality.\n   Nor does the historical background against which the\nATS was enacted overcome the presumption against ap-\nplication to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.\nSee Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting\nthat \u201c[a]ssuredly context can be consulted\u201d in determining\nwhether a cause of action applies abroad). We explained\nin Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, \u201cthree prin-\ncipal offenses against the law of nations\u201d had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. 542 U. S., at\n723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 68 (1769). The first two offenses have no\nnecessary extraterritorial application. Indeed, Blackstone\u2014\nin describing them\u2014did so in terms of conduct occur-\nring within the forum nation. See ibid.

Each concerned the rights of ambas-\nsadors, and each involved conduct within the Union. In\n1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically as-\nsaulted Francis Barbe Marbois\u2014the Secretary of the\nFrench Legion\u2014in Philadelphia. The assault led the\nFrench Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest\nwith the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the\ncountry unless an adequate remedy were provided.\nRespublica v. De Longschamps, 1 Dall. 111 (O. T. Phila.\n1784); Sosa, supra, at 716\u2013717, and n. 11. And in 1787,\na New York constable entered the Dutch Ambassador\u2019s\nhouse and arrested one of his domestic servants. See\nCasto, The Federal Courts\u2019 Protective Jurisdiction over\nTorts Committed in Violation of the Law of Nations, 18\nConn. L. Rev. 467, 494 (1986). At the request of Secretary\nof Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City\narrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because\n\u201c \u2018neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet\npassed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of\nAmbassadors,\u2019 \u201d the extent of any available relief would\ndepend on the common law. See Bradley, The Alien Tort\nStatute and Article III, 42 Va. J. Int\u2019l L. 587, 641\u2013642\n(2002) (quoting 3 Dept. of State, The Diplomatic Corre-\nspondence of the United States of America 447 (1837)).\nThe two cases in which the ATS was invoked shortly after\nits passage also concerned conduct within the territory of\nthe United States. See Bolchos, 3 F. Cas. 810 (wrongful\nseizure of slaves from a vessel while in port in the United\nStates); Moxon, 17 F. Cas. 942 (wrongful seizure in United\nStates territorial waters).\n   These prominent contemporary examples\u2014immediately\n10        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore and after passage of the ATS\u2014provide no support\nfor the proposition that Congress expected causes of action\nto be brought under the statute for violations of the law of\nnations occurring abroad.\n   The third example of a violation of the law of nations\nfamiliar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.\nPiracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the terri-\ntorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other coun-\ntry. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (\u201cThe offence of piracy,\nby common law, consists of committing those acts of rob-\nbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if com-\nmitted upon land, would have amounted to felony there\u201d).\nThis Court has generally treated the high seas the same\nas foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against\nextraterritorial application. See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian\nCenters Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 173\u2013174 (1993) (de-\nclining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Na-\ntionality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argen-\ntine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.\n428, 440 (1989) (declining to apply a provision of the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).\nPetitioners contend that because Congress surely intended\nthe ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates,\nit necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to con-\nduct occurring abroad.\n   Applying U. S. law to pirates, however, does not typi-\ncally impose the sovereign will of the United States onto\nconduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of\nanother sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign\npolicy consequences. Pirates were fair game wherever\nfound, by any nation, because they generally did not oper-\nate within any jurisdiction. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at\n71. We do not think that the existence of a cause of action\nagainst them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other\ncauses of action under the ATS reach conduct that does\noccur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmay well be a category unto themselves. See Morrison,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (\u201c[W]hen a statute pro-\nvides for some extraterritorial application, the presump-\ntion against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms\u201d); see also Microsoft Corp., 550 U. S.,\nat 455\u2013456.\n   Petitioners also point to a 1795 opinion authored by\nAttorney General William Bradford. See Breach of Neu-\ntrality, 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57. In 1794, in the midst of war\nbetween France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding\nthe American official policy of neutrality, several U. S.\ncitizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and\nplundered the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response\nto a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney Gen-\neral Bradford responded as follows:\n       So far . . . as the transactions complained of origi-\n    nated or took place in a foreign country, they are not\n    within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors\n    be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the\n    United States. But crimes committed on the high\n    seas are within the jurisdiction of the . . . courts of the\n    United States; and, so far as the offence was commit-\n    ted thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be le-\n    gally prosecuted in . . . those courts . . . . But some\n    doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms\n    in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.\n    But there can be no doubt that the company or indi-\n    viduals who have been injured by these acts of hostil-\n    ity have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the\n    United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to\n    these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort\n    only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of\n    the United States . . . .\u201d Id., at 58\u201359.\n  Petitioners read the last sentence as confirming that\n\u201cthe Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to\n12        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw of nations violations committed on the territory of a\nforeign sovereign.\u201d Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33. Re-\nspondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford\nreferred to \u201cthese acts of hostility,\u201d he meant the acts only\ninsofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his\nconclusion were broader, it was only because the applica-\nble treaty had extraterritorial reach. See Supp. Brief for\nRespondents 28\u201330. The Solicitor General, having once\nread the opinion to stand for the proposition that an \u201cATS\nsuit could be brought against American citizens for\nbreaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take\nplace in a foreign country,\u201d Supp. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 8, n. 1 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted), now suggests the opinion \u201ccould have\nbeen meant to encompass . . . conduct [occurring within\nthe foreign territory],\u201d id., at 8.\n   Attorney General Bradford\u2019s opinion defies a definitive\nreading and we need not adopt one here. Whatever its pre-\ncise meaning, it deals with U. S. citizens who, by partic-\nipating in an attack taking place both on the high seas\nand on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the\nUnited States and Great Britain. The opinion hardly\nsuffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the\npresumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed\nto make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for\nthe enforcement of international norms. As Justice Story\nput it, \u201cNo nation has ever yet pretended to be the custos\nmorum of the whole world . . . .\u201d United States v. The La\nJeune Eugenie, 26 F. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC.\nMass. 1822). It is implausible to suppose that the First\nCongress wanted their fledgling Republic\u2014struggling to\nreceive international recognition\u2014to be the first. Indeed,\nthe parties offer no evidence that any nation, meek or\nmighty, presumed to do such a thing.\n   The United States was, however, embarrassed by its\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

The ATS ensured that the United States could\nprovide a forum for adjudicating such incidents. See Sosa,\nsupra, at 715\u2013718, and n. 11. Nothing about this histori-\ncal context suggests that Congress also intended federal\ncommon law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for\nconduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.\n   Indeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing\nsuch a cause of action could have generated it. Recent\nexperience bears this out. See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,\n654 F. 3d 11, 77\u201378 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\ning in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial\napplications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia,\nPapua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the\nUnited Kingdom). Moreover, accepting petitioners\u2019 view\nwould imply that other nations, also applying the law of\nnations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged\nviolations of the law of nations occurring in the United\nStates, or anywhere else in the world. The presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality guards against our courts trig-\ngering such serious foreign policy consequences, and in-\nstead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the\npolitical branches.\n   We therefore conclude that the presumption against\nextraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and\nthat nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n\u201c[T]here is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here,\u201d\n14        KIOBEL v.

Specifically, I agree that when\nAlien Tort Statute (ATS) \u201cclaims touch and concern the\nterritory of the United States, they must do so with suffi-\ncient force to displace the presumption against extraterri-\ntorial application.\u201d Ante, at 14. This formulation obviously\nleaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom\nin the Court\u2019s preference for this narrow approach. I write\nseparately to set out the broader standard that leads me\nto the conclusion that this case falls within the scope of\nthe presumption.\n   In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.

We also reiterated that a cause of action falls out-\nside the scope of the presumption\u2014and thus is not barred\nby the presumption\u2014only if the event or relationship that\nwas \u201cthe \u2018focus\u2019 of congressional concern\u201d under the rele-\nvant statute takes place within the United States.

For example, because \u201cthe focus of the\n[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place\nwhere the deception originated, but upon purchases and\nsales of securities in the United States,\u201d we held in Mor-\nrison that \u00a710(b) of the Exchange Act applies \u201conly\u201d to\n\u201ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,\nand domestic transactions in other securities.\u201d 561 U.

S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshould give serious weight to the Executive Branch\u2019s view\nof the case\u2019s impact on foreign policy.\u201d Ibid. Adjudicating\nany such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with\nthose notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the\nsovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of\nits own laws and their enforcement. Id., at 761 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See\nalso F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542\nU. S. 155, 165\u2013169 (2004).\n   Recognizing that Congress enacted the ATS to permit\nrecovery of damages from pirates and others who violated\nbasic international law norms as understood in 1789, Sosa\nessentially leads today\u2019s judges to ask: Who are today\u2019s\npirates? See 542 U. S., at 724\u2013725 (majority opinion). We\nprovided a framework for answering that question by\nsetting down principles drawn from international norms\nand designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar\nin character and specificity to piracy. Id., at 725.\n   In this case we must decide the extent to which this\njurisdictional statute opens a federal court\u2019s doors to those\nharmed by activities belonging to the limited class that\nSosa set forth when those activities take place abroad. To\nhelp answer this question here, I would refer both to Sosa\nand, as in Sosa, to norms of international law. See Part II,\ninfra.\n                                 B\n   In my view the majority\u2019s effort to answer the question\nby referring to the \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality\u201d\ndoes not work well. That presumption \u201crests on the per-\nception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect\nto domestic, not foreign matters.\u201d Morrison v. National\nAustralia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n5\u20136). See ante, at 4. The ATS, however, was enacted with\n\u201cforeign matters\u201d in mind. The statute\u2019s text refers explic-\nitly to \u201calien[s],\u201d \u201ctreat[ies],\u201d and \u201cthe law of nations.\u201d 28\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71350. The statute\u2019s purpose was to address\n\u201cviolations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial\nremedy and at the same time threatening serious con-\nsequences in international affairs.\u201d Sosa, 542 U. S., at\n715. And at least one of the three kinds of activities that\nwe found to fall within the statute\u2019s scope, namely piracy,\nibid., normally takes place abroad. See 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).\n   The majority cannot wish this piracy example away by\nemphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas. See\nante, at 10. That is because the robbery and murder that\nmake up piracy do not normally take place in the water;\nthey take place on a ship. And a ship is like land, in that\nit falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it\nflies. See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros\nde Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20\u201321 (1963); 2 Restatement\n\u00a7502, Comment d (\u201c[F]lag state has jurisdiction to pre-\nscribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship\u201d).\nIndeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed piracy as an \u201coffenc[e] against the nation under\nwhose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular\njurisdiction all on board the vessel are.\u201d United States v.\nPalmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 632 (1818). See United States v.\nFurlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197 (1820) (a crime committed\n\u201cwithin the jurisdiction\u201d of a foreign state and a crime\ncommitted \u201cin the vessel of another nation\u201d are \u201cthe same\nthing\u201d).\n   The majority nonetheless tries to find a distinction\nbetween piracy at sea and similar cases on land. It writes,\n\u201cApplying U. S. law to pirates . . . does not typically im-\npose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another\nsovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy\nconsequences.\u201d Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But, as I\nhave just pointed out, \u201c[a]pplying U. S. law to pirates\u201d does\ntypically involve applying our law to acts taking place\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of another sovereign. Nor can\nthe majority\u2019s words \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d sensibly dis-\ntinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse\nforeign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of\n1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie\nbombing make all too clear.\n   The majority also writes, \u201cPirates were fair game wher-\never found, by any nation, because they generally did not\noperate within any jurisdiction.\u201d Ibid. I very much agree\nthat pirates were fair game \u201cwherever found.\u201d Indeed,\nthat is the point. That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are\ntoday\u2019s pirates? Certainly today\u2019s pirates include tortur-\ners and perpetrators of genocide. And today, like the\npirates of old, they are \u201cfair game\u201d where they are found.\nLike those pirates, they are \u201ccommon enemies of all man-\nkind and all nations have an equal interest in their appre-\nhension and punishment.\u201d 1 Restatement \u00a7404 Reporters\u2019\nNote 1, p. 256 (quoting In re Demjanjuk, 612 F. Supp. 544,\n556 (ND Ohio 1985) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nSee Sosa, supra, at 732. And just as a nation that har-\nbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past\ncenturies, see infra, at 8, so harboring \u201ccommon enemies\nof all mankind\u201d provokes similar concerns today.\n   Thus the Court\u2019s reasoning, as applied to the narrow\nclass of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide signifi-\ncant support for the use of any presumption against extra-\nterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary. See also\nante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this\nCourt has \u201cgenerally treated the high seas the same as\nforeign soil for purposes of the presumption against extra-\nterritorial application\u201d).\n   In any event, as the Court uses its \u201cpresumption against\nextraterritorial application,\u201d it offers only limited help in\ndeciding the question presented, namely \u201c \u2018under what\ncircumstances the Alien Tort Statute . . . allows courts to\nrecognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.\u2019 \u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The ma-\njority echoes in this jurisdictional context Sosa\u2019s warning\nto use \u201ccaution\u201d in shaping federal common-law causes of\naction. Ante, at 5. But it also makes clear that a statutory\nclaim might sometimes \u201ctouch and concern the territory of\nthe United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.\u201d Ante, at 14. It leaves for another day the\ndetermination of just when the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality might be \u201covercome.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n                              II\n   In applying the ATS to acts \u201coccurring within the terri-\ntory of a[nother] sovereign,\u201d I would assume that Congress\nintended the statute\u2019s jurisdictional reach to match the\nstatute\u2019s underlying substantive grasp. That grasp, de-\nfined by the statute\u2019s purposes set forth in Sosa, includes\ncompensation for those injured by piracy and its modern-\nday equivalents, at least where allowing such compensa-\ntion avoids \u201cserious\u201d negative international \u201cconsequences\u201d\nfor the United States. 542 U. S., at 715. And just as\nwe have looked to established international substantive\nnorms to help determine the statute\u2019s substantive reach,\nid., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional\nnorms to help determine the statute\u2019s jurisdictional\nscope.\n   The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is\nhelpful. Section 402 recognizes that, subject to \u00a7403\u2019s \u201crea-\nsonableness\u201d requirement, a nation may apply its law\n(for example, federal common law, see 542 U. S., at 729\u2013\n730) not only (1) to \u201cconduct\u201d that \u201ctakes place [or to per-\nsons or things] within its territory\u201d but also (2) to the\n\u201cactivities, interests, status, or relations of its nationals\noutside as well as within its territory,\u201d (3) to \u201cconduct\noutside its territory that has or is intended to have sub-\nstantial effect within its territory,\u201d and (4) to certain\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nforeign \u201cconduct outside its territory . . . that is directed\nagainst the security of the state or against a limited class\nof other state interests.\u201d In addition, \u00a7404 of the Restate-\nment explains that a \u201cstate has jurisdiction to define and\nprescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by\nthe community of nations as of universal concern, such as\npiracy, slave trade,\u201d and analogous behavior.\n   Considering these jurisdictional norms in light of both\nthe ATS\u2019s basic purpose (to provide compensation for those\ninjured by today\u2019s pirates) and Sosa\u2019s basic caution (to\navoid international friction), I believe that the statute\nprovides jurisdiction where (1) the alleged tort occurs on\nAmerican soil, (2) the defendant is an American national,\nor (3) the defendant\u2019s conduct substantially and adversely\naffects an important American national interest, and that\nincludes a distinct interest in preventing the United\nStates from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as\ncriminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of\nmankind.\n   I would interpret the statute as providing jurisdiction\nonly where distinct American interests are at issue. Doing\nso reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present\nstatute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, \u201cNo nation\nha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the\nwhole world.\u201d United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, 26\nF. Cas. 832, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC Mass. 1822). That re-\nstriction also should help to minimize international fric-\ntion. Further limiting principles such as exhaustion,\nforum non conveniens, and comity would do the same. So\nwould a practice of courts giving weight to the views of the\nExecutive Branch. See Sosa, 542 U. S., at 733, n. 21; id.,\nat 761 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\n   As I have indicated, we should treat this Nation\u2019s interest\nin not becoming a safe harbor for violators of the most fun-\ndamental international norms as an important jurisdiction-\nrelated interest justifying application of the ATS in light of\n8         KIOBEL v.

In\nFilartiga, 630 F. 2d 876, an alien plaintiff brought a law-\nsuit against an alien defendant for damages suffered\nthrough acts of torture that the defendant allegedly in-\nflicted in a foreign nation, Paraguay. Neither plaintiff nor\ndefendant was an American national and the actions\nunderlying the lawsuit took place abroad. The defendant,\nhowever, \u201chad . . . resided in the United States for more\nthan ninth months\u201d before being sued, having overstayed\nhis visitor\u2019s visa. Id., at 878\u2013879. Jurisdiction was\ndeemed proper because the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct\nviolated a well-established international law norm, and\nthe suit vindicated our Nation\u2019s interest in not providing a\nsafe harbor, free of damages claims, for those defendants\nwho commit such conduct.\n   In Marcos, the plaintiffs were nationals of the Philip-\npines, the defendant was a Philippine national, and the\nalleged wrongful act, death by torture, took place abroad.\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1469, 1475 (CA9 1994); In re Estate of Marcos Hu-\nman Rights Litigation, 978 F. 2d 493, 495\u2013496, 500 (CA9\n1992).

(\u201cSosa was a case of nonmaritime extra-\nterritorial conduct yet no Justice suggested that therefore\nit couldn\u2019t be maintained\u201d). Not surprisingly, both before\nand after Sosa, courts have consistently rejected the no-\ntion that the ATS is categorically barred from extraterrito-\nrial application. See, e.g., 643 F. 3d, at 1025 (\u201c[N]o court\nto our knowledge has ever held that it doesn\u2019t apply extra-\nterritorially\u201d); Sarei v.

C. \u00a72340A(b)(2) (authorizing prosecution of tor-\nturers if \u201cthe alleged offender is present in the United\nStates, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or\nalleged offender\u201d); \u00a71091(e)(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V)\n(genocide prosecution authorized when, \u201cregardless of\nwhere the offense is committed, the alleged offender is . . .\npresent in the United States\u201d); note following 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71350, \u00a72(a) (private right of action on behalf of individu-\nals harmed by an act of torture or extrajudicial killing\ncommitted \u201cunder actual or apparent authority, or color of\nlaw, of any foreign nation\u201d). See also S. Rep. No. 102\u2013249,\nsupra, at 3\u20134 (purpose to \u201cmak[e] sure that torturers and\ndeath squads will no longer have a safe haven in the\nUnited States,\u201d by \u201cproviding a civil cause of action in\nU. S. courts for torture committed abroad\u201d).\n  Thus, the jurisdictional approach that I would use is\nanalogous to, and consistent with, the approaches of a\nnumber of other nations. It is consistent with the ap-\nproaches set forth in the Restatement. Its insistence upon\nthe presence of some distinct American interest, its reli-\nance upon courts also invoking other related doctrines\nsuch as comity, exhaustion, and forum non conveniens,\nalong with its dependence (for its workability) upon courts\nobtaining, and paying particular attention to, the views of\n14        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Executive Branch, all should obviate the majority\u2019s\nconcern that our jurisdictional example would lead \u201cother\nnations, also applying the law of nations,\u201d to \u201chale our\ncitizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of\nnations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else\nin the world.\u201d Ante, at 13.\n   Most importantly, this jurisdictional view is consistent\nwith the substantive view of the statute that we took in\nSosa. This approach would avoid placing the statute\u2019s\njurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives,\nholding out \u201cthe word of promise\u201d of compensation for\nvictims of the torturer, while \u201cbreak[ing] it to the hope.\u201d\n                             III\n   Applying these jurisdictional principles to this case,\nhowever, I agree with the Court that jurisdiction does not\nlie. The defendants are two foreign corporations. Their\nshares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded\non the New York Stock Exchange. Their only presence in\nthe United States consists of an office in New York City\n(actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that\nhelps to explain their business to potential investors. See\nSupp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal\nDutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App.\n55. The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but\nnationals of other nations. The conduct at issue took place\nabroad. And the plaintiffs allege, not that the defendants\ndirectly engaged in acts of torture, genocide, or the equiva-\nlent, but that they helped others (who are not American\nnationals) to do so.\n   Under these circumstances, even if the New York office\nwere a sufficient basis for asserting general jurisdiction,\nbut see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), it would be farfetched to believe,\nbased solely upon the defendants\u2019 minimal and indirect\nAmerican presence, that this legal action helps to vindi-\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Argued February 28, 2012\u2014Reargued October 1, 2012\u2014\n                     Decided April 17, 2013\nPetitioners, Nigerian nationals residing in the United States, filed suit\n  in federal court under the Alien Tort Statute, alleging that respond-\n  ents\u2014certain Dutch, British, and Nigerian corporations\u2014aided and\n  abetted the Nigerian Government in committing violations of the law\n  of nations in Nigeria. The ATS provides that \u201c[t]he district courts\n  shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a\n  tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of\n  the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350. The District Court dismissed\n  several of petitioners\u2019 claims, but on interlocutory appeal, the Second\n  Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, reasoning that the law of na-\n  tions does not recognize corporate liability. This Court granted certi-\n  orari, and ordered supplemental briefing on whether and under what\n  circumstances courts may recognize a cause of action under the ATS,\n  for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\n  sovereign other than the United States.\nHeld: The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims un-\n der the ATS, and nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n Pp. 3\u201314.\n    (a) Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS is a juris-\n dictional statute that creates no causes of action. It permits federal\n courts to \u201crecognize private claims [for a modest number of interna-\n tional law violations] under federal common law.\u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-\n Machain, 542 U. S. 692, 732. In contending that a claim under the\n ATS does not reach conduct occurring in a foreign sovereign\u2019s territo-\n2             KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ry, respondents rely on the presumption against extraterritorial ap-\n    plication, which provides that \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indica-\n    tion of an extraterritorial application, it has none,\u201d Morrison v. Na-\n    tional Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___. The presumption\n    \u201cserves to protect against unintended clashes between our laws and\n    those of other nations which could result in international discord.\u201d\n    EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248. It is typically\n    applied to discern whether an Act of Congress regulating conduct ap-\n    plies abroad, see, e.g., id., at 246, but its underlying principles simi-\n    larly constrain courts when considering causes of action that may be\n    brought under the ATS. Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial\n    interference in the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in this con-\n    text, where the question is not what Congress has done but what\n    courts may do. These foreign policy concerns are not diminished by\n    the fact that Sosa limited federal courts to recognizing causes of ac-\n    tion only for alleged violations of international law norms that are\n    \u201c \u2018specific, universal, and obligatory,\u201d 542 U. S., at 732. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) The presumption is not rebutted by the text, history, or purpos-\n    es of the ATS. Nothing in the ATS\u2019s text evinces a clear indication of\n    extraterritorial reach. Violations of the law of nations affecting\n    aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. And gener-\n    ic terms, like \u201cany\u201d in the phrase \u201cany civil action,\u201d do not rebut the\n    presumption against extraterritoriality. See, e.g., Morrison, supra, at\n    ___. Petitioners also rely on the common-law \u201ctransitory torts\u201d doc-\n    trine, but that doctrine is inapposite here; as the Court has ex-\n    plained, \u201cthe only justification for allowing a party to recover when\n    the cause of action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well-\n    founded belief that it was a cause of action in that place,\u201d Cuba R. Co.\n    v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479. The question under Sosa is not wheth-\n    er a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action pro-\n    vided by foreign or even international law. The question is instead\n    whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action under\n    U. S. law to enforce a norm of international law. That question is not\n    answered by the mere fact that the ATS mentions torts.\n       The historical background against which the ATS was enacted also\n    does not overcome the presumption. When the ATS was passed,\n    \u201cthree principal offenses against the law of nations\u201d had been identi-\n    fied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement of the\n    rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Sosa, supra, at 723, 724. Promi-\n    nent contemporary examples of the first two offenses\u2014immediately\n    before and after passage of the ATS\u2014provide no support for the\n    proposition that Congress expected causes of action to be brought un-\n    der the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.\n    And although the offense of piracy normally occurs on the high seas,\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other\n  country, applying U. S. law to pirates does not typically impose the\n  sovereign will of the United States onto conduct occurring within the\n  territorial jurisdiction of another sovereign, and therefore carries less\n  direct foreign policy consequences. A 1795 opinion of Attorney Gen-\n  eral William Bradford regarding the conduct of U. S. citizens on both\n  the high seas and a foreign shore is at best ambiguous about the\n  ATS\u2019s extraterritorial application; it does not suffice to counter the\n  weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritori-\n  ality. Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed to\n  make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for the enforce-\n  ment of international norms.

Petition-\ners sued under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350,\nalleging that the corporations aided and abetted the Nige-\nrian Government in committing violations of the law of\nnations in Nigeria. The question presented is whether\nand under what circumstances courts may recognize a\ncause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations\nof the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\nsovereign other than the United States.\n                             I\n  Petitioners were residents of Ogoniland, an area of 250\nsquare miles located in the Niger delta area of Nigeria and\npopulated by roughly half a million people. When the\ncomplaint was filed, respondents Royal Dutch Petroleum\nCompany and Shell Transport and Trading Company,\np.l.c., were holding companies incorporated in the Nether-\n2         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlands and England, respectively. Their joint subsidiary,\nrespondent Shell Petroleum Development Company of\nNigeria, Ltd. (SPDC), was incorporated in Nigeria, and\nengaged in oil exploration and production in Ogoniland.\nAccording to the complaint, after concerned residents of\nOgoniland began protesting the environmental effects of\nSPDC\u2019s practices, respondents enlisted the Nigerian Gov-\nernment to violently suppress the burgeoning demonstra-\ntions. Throughout the early 1990\u2019s, the complaint alleges,\nNigerian military and police forces attacked Ogoni vil-\nlages, beating, raping, killing, and arresting residents and\ndestroying or looting property. Petitioners further allege\nthat respondents aided and abetted these atrocities by,\namong other things, providing the Nigerian forces with\nfood, transportation, and compensation, as well as by al-\nlowing the Nigerian military to use respondents\u2019 property\nas a staging ground for attacks.\n   Following the alleged atrocities, petitioners moved to\nthe United States where they have been granted political\nasylum and now reside as legal residents. See Supp. Brief\nfor Petitioners 3, and n. 2. They filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, alleging jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute\nand requesting relief under customary international law.\nThe ATS provides, in full, that \u201c[t]he district courts shall\nhave original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for\na tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or\na treaty of the United States.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350. Accord-\ning to petitioners, respondents violated the law of nations\nby aiding and abetting the Nigerian Government in com-\nmitting (1) extrajudicial killings; (2) crimes against hu-\nmanity; (3) torture and cruel treatment; (4) arbitrary\narrest and detention; (5) violations of the rights to life,\nliberty, security, and association; (6) forced exile; and (7)\nproperty destruction. The District Court dismissed the\nfirst, fifth, sixth, and seventh claims, reasoning that the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfacts alleged to support those claims did not give rise to a\nviolation of the law of nations. The court denied respond-\nents\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining\nclaims, but certified its order for interlocutory appeal\npursuant to \u00a71292(b).\n  The Second Circuit dismissed the entire complaint, rea-\nsoning that the law of nations does not recognize corpo-\nrate liability. 621 F. 3d 111 (2010). We granted certiorari\nto consider that question. 565 U. S. ___ (2011). After oral\nargument, we directed the parties to file supplemen-\ntal briefs addressing an additional question: \u201cWhether\nand under what circumstances the [ATS] allows courts\nto recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.\u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2012). We heard\noral argument again and now affirm the judgment below,\nbased on our answer to the second question.\n                              II\n  Passed as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the ATS was\ninvoked twice in the late 18th century, but then only once\nmore over the next 167 years.

Seafarers\u2019 Int\u2019l\nUnion, 278 F. 2d 49, 51\u201352 (CA2 1960) (per curiam). The\nstatute provides district courts with jurisdiction to hear\ncertain claims, but does not expressly provide any causes\nof action. We held in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U. S.\n692, 714 (2004), however, that the First Congress did not\nintend the provision to be \u201cstillborn.\u201d The grant of juris-\ndiction is instead \u201cbest read as having been enacted on the\nunderstanding that the common law would provide a\ncause of action for [a] modest number of international law\nviolations.\u201d Id., at 724. We thus held that federal courts\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay \u201crecognize private claims [for such violations] under\nfederal common law.\u201d Id., at 732. The Court in Sosa\nrejected the plaintiff \u2019s claim in that case for \u201carbitrary\narrest and detention,\u201d on the ground that it failed to state\na violation of the law of nations with the requisite \u201cdefi-\nnite content and acceptance among civilized nations.\u201d Id.,\nat 699, 732.\n   The question here is not whether petitioners have stated\na proper claim under the ATS, but whether a claim may\nreach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sover-\neign. Respondents contend that claims under the ATS\ndo not, relying primarily on a canon of statutory interpre-\ntation known as the presumption against extraterritorial\napplication. That canon provides that \u201c[w]hen a statute\ngives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,\nit has none,\u201d Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd.,\n561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 6), and reflects the\n\u201cpresumption that United States law governs domestically\nbut does not rule the world,\u201d Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T\nCorp., 550 U. S. 437, 454 (2007).\n   This presumption \u201cserves to protect against unintended\nclashes between our laws and those of other nations which\ncould result in international discord.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (Aramco). As\nthis Court has explained:\n    \u201cFor us to run interference in . . . a delicate field of\n    international relations there must be present the af-\n    firmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed.\n    It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly\n    such an important policy decision where the possibili-\n    ties of international discord are so evident and retali-\n    ative action so certain.\u201d Benz v. Compania Naviera\n    Hidalgo, S. A., 353 U. S. 138, 147 (1957). The pre-\n    sumption against extraterritorial application helps\n    ensure that the Judiciary does not erroneously adopt\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    an interpretation of U. S. law that carries foreign pol-\n    icy consequences not clearly intended by the political\n    branches.\n   We typically apply the presumption to discern whether\nan Act of Congress regulating conduct applies abroad.\nSee, e.g., Aramco, supra, at 246 (\u201cThese cases present the\nissue whether Title VII applies extraterritorially to regu-\nlate the employment practices of United States employers\nwho employ United States citizens abroad\u201d); Morrison,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (noting that the question of\nextraterritorial application was a \u201cmerits question,\u201d not a\nquestion of jurisdiction). The ATS, on the other hand, is\n\u201cstrictly jurisdictional.\u201d Sosa, 542 U. S., at 713. It does\nnot directly regulate conduct or afford relief. It instead\nallows federal courts to recognize certain causes of action\nbased on sufficiently definite norms of international law.\nBut we think the principles underlying the canon of inter-\npretation similarly constrain courts considering causes of\naction that may be brought under the ATS.\n   Indeed, the danger of unwarranted judicial interference\nin the conduct of foreign policy is magnified in the context\nof the ATS, because the question is not what Congress has\ndone but instead what courts may do. This Court in Sosa\nrepeatedly stressed the need for judicial caution in consid-\nering which claims could be brought under the ATS, in\nlight of foreign policy concerns. As the Court explained,\n\u201cthe potential [foreign policy] implications . . . of recog-\nnizing . . . . causes [under the ATS] should make courts\nparticularly wary of impinging on the discretion of the\nLegislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign\naffairs.\u201d Id., at 727; see also id., at 727\u2013728 (\u201cSince many\nattempts by federal courts to craft remedies for the viola-\ntion of new norms of international law would raise risks of\nadverse foreign policy consequences, they should be under-\ntaken, if at all, with great caution\u201d); id., at 727 (\u201c[T]he\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npossible collateral consequences of making international\nrules privately actionable argue for judicial caution\u201d).\nThese concerns, which are implicated in any case arising\nunder the ATS, are all the more pressing when the ques-\ntion is whether a cause of action under the ATS reaches\nconduct within the territory of another sovereign.\n    These concerns are not diminished by the fact that Sosa\nlimited federal courts to recognizing causes of action only\nfor alleged violations of international law norms that are\n\u201c \u2018specific, universal, and obligatory.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 732 (quoting\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1475 (CA9 1994)). As demonstrated by Congress\u2019s\nenactment of the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,\n106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, identifying\nsuch a norm is only the beginning of defining a cause of\naction. See id., \u00a73 (providing detailed definitions for extra-\njudicial killing and torture); id., \u00a72 (specifying who may be\nliable, creating a rule of exhaustion, and establishing a\nstatute of limitations). Each of these decisions carries\nwith it significant foreign policy implications.\n    The principles underlying the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality thus constrain courts exercising their power\nunder the ATS.\n                             III\n   Petitioners contend that even if the presumption ap-\nplies, the text, history, and purposes of the ATS rebut\nit for causes of action brought under that statute. It is\ntrue that Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can\nindicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct\noccurring abroad. See, e.g., 18 U. S.

It does\nnot.\n   To begin, nothing in the text of the statute suggests that\nCongress intended causes of action recognized under it\nto have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by\naliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does\nnot imply extraterritorial reach\u2014such violations affect-\ning aliens can occur either within or outside the United\nStates. Nor does the fact that the text reaches \u201cany civil\naction\u201d suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is\nwell established that generic terms like \u201cany\u201d or \u201cevery\u201d do\nnot rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality. See,\ne.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 13\u201314); Small v. United States,\n544 U. S. 385, 388 (2005); Aramco, 499 U. S., at 248\u2013250;\nFoley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 287 (1949).\n   Petitioners make much of the fact that the ATS provides\njurisdiction over civil actions for \u201ctorts\u201d in violation of the\nlaw of nations. They claim that in using that word, the\nFirst Congress \u201cnecessarily meant to provide for jurisdic-\ntion over extraterritorial transitory torts that could arise\non foreign soil.\u201d Supp. Brief for Petitioners 18. For sup-\nport, they cite the common-law doctrine that allowed\ncourts to assume jurisdiction over such \u201ctransitory torts,\u201d\nincluding actions for personal injury, arising abroad. See\nMostyn v. Fabrigas, 1 Cowp. 161, 177, 98 Eng. Rep. 1021,\n1030 (1774) (Mansfield, L.) (\u201c[A]ll actions of a transitory\nnature that arise abroad may be laid as happening in an\nEnglish county\u201d); Dennick v. Railroad Co., 103 U.

ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nof action arose in another civilized jurisdiction is a well\nfounded belief that it was a cause of action in that place.\u201d\nCuba R. Co. v. Crosby, 222 U. S. 473, 479 (1912) (majority\nopinion of Holmes, J.). The question under Sosa is not\nwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a\ncause of action provided by foreign or even international\nlaw. The question is instead whether the court has au-\nthority to recognize a cause of action under U. S. law to\nenforce a norm of international law. The reference to\n\u201ctort\u201d does not demonstrate that the First Congress \u201cnec-\nessarily meant\u201d for those causes of action to reach conduct\nin the territory of a foreign sovereign. In the end, nothing\nin the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication\nof extraterritoriality.\n   Nor does the historical background against which the\nATS was enacted overcome the presumption against ap-\nplication to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.\nSee Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 16) (noting\nthat \u201c[a]ssuredly context can be consulted\u201d in determining\nwhether a cause of action applies abroad). We explained\nin Sosa that when Congress passed the ATS, \u201cthree prin-\ncipal offenses against the law of nations\u201d had been identi-\nfied by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement\nof the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. 542 U. S., at\n723, 724; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws\nof England 68 (1769). The first two offenses have no\nnecessary extraterritorial application. Indeed, Blackstone\u2014\nin describing them\u2014did so in terms of conduct occur-\nring within the forum nation. See ibid.

Each concerned the rights of ambas-\nsadors, and each involved conduct within the Union. In\n1784, a French adventurer verbally and physically as-\nsaulted Francis Barbe Marbois\u2014the Secretary of the\nFrench Legion\u2014in Philadelphia. The assault led the\nFrench Minister Plenipotentiary to lodge a formal protest\nwith the Continental Congress and threaten to leave the\ncountry unless an adequate remedy were provided.\nRespublica v.

At the request of Secretary\nof Foreign Affairs John Jay, the Mayor of New York City\narrested the constable in turn, but cautioned that because\n\u201c \u2018neither Congress nor our [State] Legislature have yet\npassed any act respecting a breach of the privileges of\nAmbassadors,\u2019 \u201d the extent of any available relief would\ndepend on the common law.

ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbefore and after passage of the ATS\u2014provide no support\nfor the proposition that Congress expected causes of action\nto be brought under the statute for violations of the law of\nnations occurring abroad.\n   The third example of a violation of the law of nations\nfamiliar to the Congress that enacted the ATS was piracy.\nPiracy typically occurs on the high seas, beyond the terri-\ntorial jurisdiction of the United States or any other coun-\ntry. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at 72 (\u201cThe offence of piracy,\nby common law, consists of committing those acts of rob-\nbery and depredation upon the high seas, which, if com-\nmitted upon land, would have amounted to felony there\u201d).\nThis Court has generally treated the high seas the same\nas foreign soil for purposes of the presumption against\nextraterritorial application. See, e.g., Sale v. Haitian\nCenters Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 173\u2013174 (1993) (de-\nclining to apply a provision of the Immigration and Na-\ntionality Act to conduct occurring on the high seas); Argen-\ntine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S.\n428, 440 (1989) (declining to apply a provision of the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 to the high seas).\nPetitioners contend that because Congress surely intended\nthe ATS to provide jurisdiction for actions against pirates,\nit necessarily anticipated the statute would apply to con-\nduct occurring abroad.\n   Applying U. S. law to pirates, however, does not typi-\ncally impose the sovereign will of the United States onto\nconduct occurring within the territorial jurisdiction of\nanother sovereign, and therefore carries less direct foreign\npolicy consequences. Pirates were fair game wherever\nfound, by any nation, because they generally did not oper-\nate within any jurisdiction. See 4 Blackstone, supra, at\n71. We do not think that the existence of a cause of action\nagainst them is a sufficient basis for concluding that other\ncauses of action under the ATS reach conduct that does\noccur within the territory of another sovereign; pirates\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmay well be a category unto themselves. See Morrison,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (\u201c[W]hen a statute pro-\nvides for some extraterritorial application, the presump-\ntion against extraterritoriality operates to limit that\nprovision to its terms\u201d); see also Microsoft Corp., 550 U. S.,\nat 455\u2013456.\n   Petitioners also point to a 1795 opinion authored by\nAttorney General William Bradford. See Breach of Neu-\ntrality, 1 Op. Atty. Gen. 57. In 1794, in the midst of war\nbetween France and Great Britain, and notwithstanding\nthe American official policy of neutrality, several U. S.\ncitizens joined a French privateer fleet and attacked and\nplundered the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response\nto a protest from the British Ambassador, Attorney Gen-\neral Bradford responded as follows:\n       So far . . . as the transactions complained of origi-\n    nated or took place in a foreign country, they are not\n    within the cognizance of our courts; nor can the actors\n    be legally prosecuted or punished for them by the\n    United States. But crimes committed on the high\n    seas are within the jurisdiction of the . . . courts of the\n    United States; and, so far as the offence was commit-\n    ted thereon, I am inclined to think that it may be le-\n    gally prosecuted in . . . those courts . . . . But some\n    doubt rests on this point, in consequence of the terms\n    in which the [applicable criminal law] is expressed.\n    But there can be no doubt that the company or indi-\n    viduals who have been injured by these acts of hostil-\n    ity have a remedy by a civil suit in the courts of the\n    United States; jurisdiction being expressly given to\n    these courts in all cases where an alien sues for a tort\n    only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of\n    the United States . . . .\u201d Id., at 58\u201359.\n  Petitioners read the last sentence as confirming that\n\u201cthe Founding generation understood the ATS to apply to\n12        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw of nations violations committed on the territory of a\nforeign sovereign.\u201d Supp. Brief for Petitioners 33. Re-\nspondents counter that when Attorney General Bradford\nreferred to \u201cthese acts of hostility,\u201d he meant the acts only\ninsofar as they took place on the high seas, and even if his\nconclusion were broader, it was only because the applica-\nble treaty had extraterritorial reach. See Supp. Brief for\nRespondents 28\u201330. The Solicitor General, having once\nread the opinion to stand for the proposition that an \u201cATS\nsuit could be brought against American citizens for\nbreaching neutrality with Britain only if acts did not take\nplace in a foreign country,\u201d Supp. Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 8, n. 1 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted), now suggests the opinion \u201ccould have\nbeen meant to encompass . . . conduct [occurring within\nthe foreign territory],\u201d id., at 8.\n   Attorney General Bradford\u2019s opinion defies a definitive\nreading and we need not adopt one here. Whatever its pre-\ncise meaning, it deals with U. S. citizens who, by partic-\nipating in an attack taking place both on the high seas\nand on a foreign shore, violated a treaty between the\nUnited States and Great Britain. The opinion hardly\nsuffices to counter the weighty concerns underlying the\npresumption against extraterritoriality.\n   Finally, there is no indication that the ATS was passed\nto make the United States a uniquely hospitable forum for\nthe enforcement of international norms.

S., at 715; cf.\nThe Federalist No. 80, p. 536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Ham-\nilton) (\u201cAs the denial or perversion of justice . . . is with\nreason classed among the just causes of war, it will follow\nthat the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of all\ncauses in which the citizens of other countries are con-\ncerned\u201d). The ATS ensured that the United States could\nprovide a forum for adjudicating such incidents. See Sosa,\nsupra, at 715\u2013718, and n. 11. Nothing about this histori-\ncal context suggests that Congress also intended federal\ncommon law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for\nconduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign.\n   Indeed, far from avoiding diplomatic strife, providing\nsuch a cause of action could have generated it. Recent\nexperience bears this out. See Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.,\n654 F. 3d 11, 77\u201378 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissent-\ning in part) (listing recent objections to extraterritorial\napplications of the ATS by Canada, Germany, Indonesia,\nPapua New Guinea, South Africa, Switzerland, and the\nUnited Kingdom). Moreover, accepting petitioners\u2019 view\nwould imply that other nations, also applying the law of\nnations, could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged\nviolations of the law of nations occurring in the United\nStates, or anywhere else in the world. The presumption\nagainst extraterritoriality guards against our courts trig-\ngering such serious foreign policy consequences, and in-\nstead defers such decisions, quite appropriately, to the\npolitical branches.\n   We therefore conclude that the presumption against\nextraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and\nthat nothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.\n\u201c[T]here is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here,\u201d\n14        KIOBEL v.

This formulation obviously\nleaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom\nin the Court\u2019s preference for this narrow approach. I write\nseparately to set out the broader standard that leads me\nto the conclusion that this case falls within the scope of\nthe presumption.\n   In Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.

We also reiterated that a cause of action falls out-\nside the scope of the presumption\u2014and thus is not barred\nby the presumption\u2014only if the event or relationship that\nwas \u201cthe \u2018focus\u2019 of congressional concern\u201d under the rele-\nvant statute takes place within the United States.

For example, because \u201cthe focus of the\n[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place\nwhere the deception originated, but upon purchases and\nsales of securities in the United States,\u201d we held in Mor-\nrison that \u00a710(b) of the Exchange Act applies \u201conly\u201d to\n\u201ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,\nand domestic transactions in other securities.\u201d 561 U.

In other words, only conduct\nthat satisfies Sosa\u2019s requirements of definiteness and ac-\nceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been\n\u201cthe \u2018focus\u2019 of congressional concern,\u201d Morrison, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 17), when Congress enacted the ATS.

Rather, guided in part by\nprinciples and practices of foreign relations law, I would\nfind jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged\ntort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an Amer-\nican national, or (3) the defendant\u2019s conduct substantially\n2         KIOBEL v.

In this case, however, the\nparties and relevant conduct lack sufficient ties to the\nUnited States for the ATS to provide jurisdiction.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   Our decision in Sosa frames the question. In Sosa the\nCourt specified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), when\nenacted in 1789, \u201cwas intended as jurisdictional.\u201d 542\nU. S., at 714. We added that the statute gives today\u2019s\ncourts the power to apply certain \u201cjudge-made\u201d damages\nlaw to victims of certain foreign affairs-related miscon-\nduct, including \u201cthree specific offenses\u201d to which \u201cBlack-\nstone referred,\u201d namely \u201cviolation of safe conducts, in-\nfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\u201d Id.,\nat 715. We held that the statute provides today\u2019s federal\njudges with the power to fashion \u201ca cause of action\u201d for a\n\u201cmodest number\u201d of claims, \u201cbased on the present-day law\nof nations,\u201d and which \u201crest on a norm of international\ncharacter accepted by the civilized world and defined with\na specificity comparable to the features\u201d of those three\n\u201c18th-century paradigms.\u201d Id., at 724\u2013725.\n   We further said that, in doing so, a requirement of\n\u201cexhaust[ion]\u201d of \u201cremedies\u201d might apply. Id., at 733,\nn. 21. We noted \u201ca strong argument that federal courts\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nshould give serious weight to the Executive Branch\u2019s view\nof the case\u2019s impact on foreign policy.\u201d Ibid. Adjudicating\nany such claim must, in my view, also be consistent with\nthose notions of comity that lead each nation to respect the\nsovereign rights of other nations by limiting the reach of\nits own laws and their enforcement. Id., at 761 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See\nalso F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542\nU. S. 155, 165\u2013169 (2004).\n   Recognizing that Congress enacted the ATS to permit\nrecovery of damages from pirates and others who violated\nbasic international law norms as understood in 1789, Sosa\nessentially leads today\u2019s judges to ask: Who are today\u2019s\npirates? See 542 U. S., at 724\u2013725 (majority opinion). We\nprovided a framework for answering that question by\nsetting down principles drawn from international norms\nand designed to limit ATS claims to those that are similar\nin character and specificity to piracy. Id., at 725.\n   In this case we must decide the extent to which this\njurisdictional statute opens a federal court\u2019s doors to those\nharmed by activities belonging to the limited class that\nSosa set forth when those activities take place abroad. To\nhelp answer this question here, I would refer both to Sosa\nand, as in Sosa, to norms of international law. See Part II,\ninfra.\n                                 B\n   In my view the majority\u2019s effort to answer the question\nby referring to the \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality\u201d\ndoes not work well. That presumption \u201crests on the per-\nception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect\nto domestic, not foreign matters.\u201d Morrison v. National\nAustralia Bank Ltd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at\n5\u20136). See ante, at 4. The ATS, however, was enacted with\n\u201cforeign matters\u201d in mind. The statute\u2019s text refers explic-\nitly to \u201calien[s],\u201d \u201ctreat[ies],\u201d and \u201cthe law of nations.\u201d 28\n4         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71350. The statute\u2019s purpose was to address\n\u201cviolations of the law of nations, admitting of a judicial\nremedy and at the same time threatening serious con-\nsequences in international affairs.\u201d Sosa, 542 U. S., at\n715. And at least one of the three kinds of activities that\nwe found to fall within the statute\u2019s scope, namely piracy,\nibid., normally takes place abroad. See 4 W. Blackstone,\nCommentaries on the Law of England 72 (1769).\n   The majority cannot wish this piracy example away by\nemphasizing that piracy takes place on the high seas. See\nante, at 10. That is because the robbery and murder that\nmake up piracy do not normally take place in the water;\nthey take place on a ship. And a ship is like land, in that\nit falls within the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag it\nflies. See McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros\nde Honduras, 372 U. S. 10, 20\u201321 (1963); 2 Restatement\n\u00a7502, Comment d (\u201c[F]lag state has jurisdiction to pre-\nscribe with respect to any activity aboard the ship\u201d).\nIndeed, in the early 19th century Chief Justice Marshall\ndescribed piracy as an \u201coffenc[e] against the nation under\nwhose flag the vessel sails, and within whose particular\njurisdiction all on board the vessel are.\u201d United States v.\nPalmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85249\"><a href=\"/scotus/rkP/united-states-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632 (1818).

It writes,\n\u201cApplying U. S. law to pirates . . . does not typically im-\npose the sovereign will of the United States onto conduct\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction of another\nsovereign and therefore carries less direct foreign policy\nconsequences.\u201d Ante, at 10 (emphasis added). But, as I\nhave just pointed out, \u201c[a]pplying U. S. law to pirates\u201d does\ntypically involve applying our law to acts taking place\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Nor can\nthe majority\u2019s words \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d sensibly dis-\ntinguish land from sea for purposes of isolating adverse\nforeign policy risks, as the Barbary Pirates, the War of\n1812, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the Lockerbie\nbombing make all too clear.\n   The majority also writes, \u201cPirates were fair game wher-\never found, by any nation, because they generally did not\noperate within any jurisdiction.\u201d Ibid. I very much agree\nthat pirates were fair game \u201cwherever found.\u201d Indeed,\nthat is the point. That is why we asked, in Sosa, who are\ntoday\u2019s pirates? Certainly today\u2019s pirates include tortur-\ners and perpetrators of genocide. And today, like the\npirates of old, they are \u201cfair game\u201d where they are found.\nLike those pirates, they are \u201ccommon enemies of all man-\nkind and all nations have an equal interest in their appre-\nhension and punishment.\u201d 1 Restatement \u00a7404 Reporters\u2019\nNote 1, p. 256 (quoting In re Demjanjuk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1576549\"><a href=\"/ohnd/95DT/matter-of-extradition-of-demjanjuk/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

And just as a nation that har-\nbored pirates provoked the concern of other nations in past\ncenturies, see infra, at 8, so harboring \u201ccommon enemies\nof all mankind\u201d provokes similar concerns today.\n   Thus the Court\u2019s reasoning, as applied to the narrow\nclass of cases that Sosa described, fails to provide signifi-\ncant support for the use of any presumption against extra-\nterritoriality; rather, it suggests the contrary. See also\nante, at 10 (conceding and citing cases showing that this\nCourt has \u201cgenerally treated the high seas the same as\nforeign soil for purposes of the presumption against extra-\nterritorial application\u201d).\n   In any event, as the Court uses its \u201cpresumption against\nextraterritorial application,\u201d it offers only limited help in\ndeciding the question presented, namely \u201c \u2018under what\ncircumstances the Alien Tort Statute . . . allows courts to\nrecognize a cause of action for violations of the law of\n6         KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nnations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other\nthan the United States.\u2019 \u201d 565 U. S. ___ (2012). The ma-\njority echoes in this jurisdictional context Sosa\u2019s warning\nto use \u201ccaution\u201d in shaping federal common-law causes of\naction. Ante, at 5. But it also makes clear that a statutory\nclaim might sometimes \u201ctouch and concern the territory of\nthe United States . . . with sufficient force to displace the\npresumption.\u201d Ante, at 14. It leaves for another day the\ndetermination of just when the presumption against ex-\ntraterritoriality might be \u201covercome.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n                              II\n   In applying the ATS to acts \u201coccurring within the terri-\ntory of a[nother] sovereign,\u201d I would assume that Congress\nintended the statute\u2019s jurisdictional reach to match the\nstatute\u2019s underlying substantive grasp. That grasp, de-\nfined by the statute\u2019s purposes set forth in Sosa, includes\ncompensation for those injured by piracy and its modern-\nday equivalents, at least where allowing such compensa-\ntion avoids \u201cserious\u201d negative international \u201cconsequences\u201d\nfor the United States. 542 U. S., at 715. And just as\nwe have looked to established international substantive\nnorms to help determine the statute\u2019s substantive reach,\nid., at 729, so we should look to international jurisdictional\nnorms to help determine the statute\u2019s jurisdictional\nscope.\n   The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law is\nhelpful. Section 402 recognizes that, subject to \u00a7403\u2019s \u201crea-\nsonableness\u201d requirement, a nation may apply its law\n(for example, federal common law, see 542 U. S., at 729\u2013\n730) not only (1) to \u201cconduct\u201d that \u201ctakes place [or to per-\nsons or things] within its territory\u201d but also (2) to the\n\u201cactivities, interests, status, or relations of its nationals\noutside as well as within its territory,\u201d (3) to \u201cconduct\noutside its territory that has or is intended to have sub-\nstantial effect within its territory,\u201d and (4) to certain\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n               BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nforeign \u201cconduct outside its territory . . . that is directed\nagainst the security of the state or against a limited class\nof other state interests.\u201d In addition, \u00a7404 of the Restate-\nment explains that a \u201cstate has jurisdiction to define and\nprescribe punishment for certain offenses recognized by\nthe community of nations as of universal concern, such as\npiracy, slave trade,\u201d and analogous behavior.\n   Considering these jurisdictional norms in light of both\nthe ATS\u2019s basic purpose (to provide compensation for those\ninjured by today\u2019s pirates) and Sosa\u2019s basic caution (to\navoid international friction), I believe that the statute\nprovides jurisdiction where (1) the alleged tort occurs on\nAmerican soil, (2) the defendant is an American national,\nor (3) the defendant\u2019s conduct substantially and adversely\naffects an important American national interest, and that\nincludes a distinct interest in preventing the United\nStates from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as\ncriminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of\nmankind.\n   I would interpret the statute as providing jurisdiction\nonly where distinct American interests are at issue. Doing\nso reflects the fact that Congress adopted the present\nstatute at a time when, as Justice Story put it, \u201cNo nation\nha[d] ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the\nwhole world.\u201d United States v. La Jeune Eugenie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1274590\"><a href=\"/nc/7wTG/state-v-jeune/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847 (No. 15,551) (CC Mass. 1822). That re-\nstriction also should help to minimize international fric-\ntion. Further limiting principles such as exhaustion,\nforum non conveniens, and comity would do the same. So\nwould a practice of courts giving weight to the views of the\nExecutive Branch. See Sosa, 542 U. S., at 733, n. 21; id.,\nat 761 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\n   As I have indicated, we should treat this Nation\u2019s interest\nin not becoming a safe harbor for violators of the most fun-\ndamental international norms as an important jurisdiction-\nrelated interest justifying application of the ATS in light of\n8         KIOBEL v.

In\nFilartiga, 630 F. 2d 876, an alien plaintiff brought a law-\nsuit against an alien defendant for damages suffered\nthrough acts of torture that the defendant allegedly in-\nflicted in a foreign nation, Paraguay. Neither plaintiff nor\ndefendant was an American national and the actions\nunderlying the lawsuit took place abroad. The defendant,\nhowever, \u201chad . . . resided in the United States for more\nthan ninth months\u201d before being sued, having overstayed\nhis visitor\u2019s visa. Id., at 878\u2013879. Jurisdiction was\ndeemed proper because the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct\nviolated a well-established international law norm, and\nthe suit vindicated our Nation\u2019s interest in not providing a\nsafe harbor, free of damages claims, for those defendants\nwho commit such conduct.\n   In Marcos, the plaintiffs were nationals of the Philip-\npines, the defendant was a Philippine national, and the\nalleged wrongful act, death by torture, took place abroad.\nIn re Estate of Marcos, Human Rights Litigation, 25 F. 3d\n1467, 1469, 1475 (CA9 1994); In re Estate of Marcos Hu-\nman Rights Litigation, 978 F. 2d 493, 495\u2013496, 500 (CA9\n1992).

(\u201cSosa was a case of nonmaritime extra-\nterritorial conduct yet no Justice suggested that therefore\nit couldn\u2019t be maintained\u201d). Not surprisingly, both before\nand after Sosa, courts have consistently rejected the no-\ntion that the ATS is categorically barred from extraterrito-\nrial application. See, e.g., 643 F. 3d, at 1025 (\u201c[N]o court\nto our knowledge has ever held that it doesn\u2019t apply extra-\nterritorially\u201d); Sarei v.

Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___\n(2012) (TVPA allows suits against only natural persons).\n  Congress, while aware of the award of civil damages\nunder the ATS\u2014including cases such as Filartiga with\nforeign plaintiffs, defendants, and conduct\u2014has not\nsought to limit the statute\u2019s jurisdictional or substantive\nreach. Rather, Congress has enacted other statutes, and\nnot only criminal statutes, that allow the United States to\nprosecute (or allow victims to obtain damages from) for-\neign persons who injure foreign victims by committing\nabroad torture, genocide, and other heinous acts. See, e.g.,\n18 U. S. C. \u00a72340A(b)(2) (authorizing prosecution of tor-\nturers if \u201cthe alleged offender is present in the United\nStates, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or\nalleged offender\u201d); \u00a71091(e)(2)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. V)\n(genocide prosecution authorized when, \u201cregardless of\nwhere the offense is committed, the alleged offender is . . .\npresent in the United States\u201d); note following 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71350, \u00a72(a) (private right of action on behalf of individu-\nals harmed by an act of torture or extrajudicial killing\ncommitted \u201cunder actual or apparent authority, or color of\nlaw, of any foreign nation\u201d). See also S. Rep. No. 102\u2013249,\nsupra, at 3\u20134 (purpose to \u201cmak[e] sure that torturers and\ndeath squads will no longer have a safe haven in the\nUnited States,\u201d by \u201cproviding a civil cause of action in\nU. S. courts for torture committed abroad\u201d).\n  Thus, the jurisdictional approach that I would use is\nanalogous to, and consistent with, the approaches of a\nnumber of other nations. It is consistent with the ap-\nproaches set forth in the Restatement. Its insistence upon\nthe presence of some distinct American interest, its reli-\nance upon courts also invoking other related doctrines\nsuch as comity, exhaustion, and forum non conveniens,\nalong with its dependence (for its workability) upon courts\nobtaining, and paying particular attention to, the views of\n14        KIOBEL v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO.\n\n                BREYER, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe Executive Branch, all should obviate the majority\u2019s\nconcern that our jurisdictional example would lead \u201cother\nnations, also applying the law of nations,\u201d to \u201chale our\ncitizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of\nnations occurring in the United States, or anywhere else\nin the world.\u201d Ante, at 13.\n   Most importantly, this jurisdictional view is consistent\nwith the substantive view of the statute that we took in\nSosa. This approach would avoid placing the statute\u2019s\njurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives,\nholding out \u201cthe word of promise\u201d of compensation for\nvictims of the torturer, while \u201cbreak[ing] it to the hope.\u201d\n                             III\n   Applying these jurisdictional principles to this case,\nhowever, I agree with the Court that jurisdiction does not\nlie. The defendants are two foreign corporations. Their\nshares, like those of many foreign corporations, are traded\non the New York Stock Exchange. Their only presence in\nthe United States consists of an office in New York City\n(actually owned by a separate but affiliated company) that\nhelps to explain their business to potential investors. See\nSupp. Brief for Petitioners 4, n. 3 (citing Wiwa v. Royal\nDutch Petroleum Co., 226 F. 3d 88, 94 (CA2 2000)); App.\n55. The plaintiffs are not United States nationals but\nnationals of other nations. The conduct at issue took place\nabroad. And the plaintiffs allege, not that the defendants\ndirectly engaged in acts of torture, genocide, or the equiva-\nlent, but that they helped others (who are not American\nnationals) to do so.\n   Under these circumstances, even if the New York office\nwere a sufficient basis for asserting general jurisdiction,\nbut see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), it would be farfetched to believe,\nbased solely upon the defendants\u2019 minimal and indirect\nAmerican presence, that this legal action helps to vindi-\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
