Argued February 20, 2013—Decided April 29, 2013\nVirginia’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens\n  access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-\n  Virginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States\n  other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act. After each\n  petitioner’s request was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit\n  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\n  leges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the dormant\n  Commerce Clause. The District Court granted Virginia’s motion for\n  summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are\n “fundamental.” See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont.,\n 436 U. S. 371, 382, 388. Pp. 3–12.\n       (a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges his fundamen-\n tal right to earn a living in his chosen profession—obtaining property\n records on behalf of his clients. While the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause protects the right of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their\n occupation, or pursue a common calling,” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S.\n 518, 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege\n only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burden-\n ing out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,\n 395, 397. The Virginia FOIA’s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a\n nonprotectionist aim. Virginia’s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism\n2                         MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public offi-\n    cials; noncitizens have no comparable need. Moreover, the distinc-\n    tion between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone\n    foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Com-\n    monwealth. Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other\n    States from making a profit by trading on information contained in\n    state records is incidental. Pp. 4–6.\n         (b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges the right\n    to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth. The right to\n    take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the\n    privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180.\n    However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining\n    documents necessary to the transfer of property. Records—like title\n    and mortgage documents—maintained by the clerk of each circuit\n    court are available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax as-\n    sessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted\n    online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought\n    records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk’s\n    office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA pro-\n    cess, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to\n    own or transfer property in Virginia. Pp. 6–8.\n         (c) McBurney alleges that Virginia’s FOIA impermissibly bur-\n    dens his access to public proceedings. The Privileges and Immunities\n    Clause “secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts\n    of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,” Missouri Pa-\n    cific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257 U. S. 533, 535, but that\n    “requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access . . . upon\n    terms which . . . are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any\n    rights he may have, even though they may not be . . . the same in ex-\n    tent as those accorded to resident citizens,” Canadian Northern R.\n    Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562. Virginia’s FOIA clearly does not de-\n    prive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate” access to Common-\n    wealth courts. Virginia’s court rules provide noncitizens access to\n    nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law\n    gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to\n    records pertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized\n    Virginia’s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\n    Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA re-\n    quest. Pp. 8–10.\n         (d) Petitioners’ sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates\n    the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the\n    right to access public information on equal terms with Common-\n    wealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public infor-\n    mation is not a “fundamental” privilege or immunity of citizenship.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  The Court has repeatedly stated that the Constitution does not guar-\n  antee the existence of FOIA laws. See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept.\n  v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 40. Moreover, no\n  such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.\n  Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the maintenance or well-being\n  of the Union.” Baldwin, supra, at 388. Pp. 10–12.\n     2. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  The “common thread” among this Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\n  cases is that “the State interfered with the natural functioning of the\n  interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome\n  regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806.\n  Virginia’s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate\n  market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market. Accord-\n  ingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause\n  case. Even shoehorned into the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\n  framework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar as there is\n  a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a\n  product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Com-\n  monwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not violate the\n  dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a\n  state program, it “limits benefits generated by [that] state program to\n  those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to\n  serve.” Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442. Pp. 12–14.\n667 F. 3d 454, affirmed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Code Ann. §2.2–3700 et seq.,\nviolates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\nArticle IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce\nClause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nprovides that “all public records shall be open to inspection\nand copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,” but\nit grants no such right to non-Virginians. §2.2–3704(A)\n(Lexis 2011).\n   Petitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccess-\nfully sought information under the Act and then brought\nthis constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that\npetitioners’ constitutional rights were not violated. By\nmeans other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available\nto petitioners most of the information that they sought,\nand the Commonwealth’s refusal to furnish the additional\ninformation did not abridge any constitutionally protected\nprivilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dor-\n2                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Informa-\ntion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful\nsense, but instead provides a service that is related to\nstate citizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners’ constitu-\ntional claims.\n                               I\n   Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W. Hurlbert\nare citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively.\nMcBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under\nthe Virginia FOIA, but their requests were denied because\nof their citizenship.\n   McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose ex-wife\nis a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her\nchild support obligations, McBurney asked the Common-\nwealth’s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a\npetition for child support on his behalf. The agency com-\nplied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attrib-\nutes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him\nnine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for\nthe agency’s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA re-\nquest seeking “all emails, notes, files, memos, reports,\nletters, policies, [and] opinions” pertaining to his family,\nalong with all documents “regarding [his] application for\nchild support” and all documents pertaining to the han-\ndling of child support claims like his. App. in No. 11–1099\n(CA4), p. 39A. The agency denied McBurney’s request on\nthe ground that he was not a Virginia citizen. McBurney\nlater requested the same documents under Virginia’s Gov-\nernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,\nVa. Code Ann. §2.2–3800 et seq., and through that re-\nquest he received most of the information he had sought\nthat pertained specifically to his own case. He did not,\nhowever, receive any general policy information about how\nthe agency handled claims like his.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a\nland/title company to obtain real estate tax records for\nproperties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia\nFOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County\nReal Estate Assessor’s Office, but his request was denied\nbecause he was not a Virginia citizen.\n   Petitioners filed suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\nleges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the\ndormant Commerce Clause.

See, e.g., Ala. Code §36–12–40 (2012 Cum.\nSupp.); Ark. Code Ann. §25–19–105 (2011 Supp.); Del.\nCode Ann., Tit. 29, §10003 (2012 Supp.); Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§109.180 (2012); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §91–A:4 (West\n2012); N. J. Stat. Ann. §47:1A–1 (West 2003); Tenn. Code\nAnn. §10–7–503 (2012). In Lee v. Minner, 458 F. 3d 194\n(2006), the Third Circuit held that this feature of Dela-\nware’s FOIA violated the Privileges and Immunities\nClause. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 568\nU. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, “[t]he Citi-\nzens of each State [are] entitled to all Privileges and Im-\nmunities of Citizens in the several States.” U. S. Const.,\nArt. IV, §2, cl. 1. We have said that “[t]he object of\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause is to ‘strongly . . .\nconstitute the citizens of the United States [as] one peo-\n4                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple,’ by ‘plac[ing] the citizens of each State upon the same\nfooting with citizens of other States, so far as the ad-\nvantages resulting from citizenship in those States are\nconcerned.’ ” Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal,\n522 U. S. 287, 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have\ncautioned, that “state citizenship or residency may never\nbe used by a State to distinguish among persons.” Bald-\nwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371,\n383 (1978). “Nor must a State always apply all its laws or\nall its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident,\nwho may request it so to do.” Ibid. Rather, we have long\nheld that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects\nonly those privileges and immunities that are “fundamen-\ntal.” See, e.g., id., at 382, 388.\n  Petitioners allege that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision violates four different “fundamental” privileges\nor immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common call-\ning, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the\nVirginia courts, and access to public information. The first\nthree items on that list, however, are not abridged by the\nVirginia FOIA, and the fourth—framed broadly—is not\nprotected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n                              A\n   Hurlbert argues that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA pro-\nvision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen\nprofession, namely, obtaining property records from state\nand local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct\nthat the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the\nright of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their occupa-\ntion, or pursue a common calling.” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437\nU. S. 518, 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper, 470\nU. S. 274, 280 (1985) (“ ‘[O]ne of the privileges which the\nClause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing\nbusiness in State B on terms of substantial equality with\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe citizens of that State’ ”). But the Virginia FOIA does\nnot abridge Hulbert’s ability to engage in a common call-\ning in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immuni-\nties Clause. Rather, the Court has struck laws down as\nviolating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only\nwhen those laws were enacted for the protectionist pur-\npose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Hicklin,\nsupra, (striking down as a violation of noncitizens’ privi-\nleges and immunities an “Alaska Hire” statute containing\na resident hiring preference for all employment related to\nthe development of the State’s oil and gas resources);\nToomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395, 397 (1948) (striking\ndown a South Carolina statute imposing a $2,500 license\nfee on out-of-state shrimping boats and only a $25 fee on\nin-state shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that\nthe “purpose and effect of this statute . . . [was] not to\nconserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby\ncreate a commercial monopoly for South Carolina resi-\ndents,” and the “record cas[t] some doubt on” the State’s\ncounterassertion that the statute’s “obvious purpose was\nto conserve its shrimp supply”); United Building & Constr.\nTrades Council of Camden Cty. v. Mayor and Council of\nCamden, 465 U. S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal\nordinance requiring that at least 40% of employees of\ncontractors and subcontractors working on city construc-\ntion projects be city residents facially burdened out-of-\nstate citizens’ ability to pursue a common calling). In each\ncase, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to ad-\nvantage in-state workers and commercial interests at the\nexpense of their out-of-state counterparts.\n   Virginia’s FOIA differs sharply from those statutes. By\nits own terms, Virginia’s FOIA was enacted to “ensur[e]\nthe people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies\nwherein the business of the people is being conducted.”\n6                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVa. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does\nnot allege—and has offered no proof—that the challenged\nprovision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to\nprovide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia\ncitizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 67\n(2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to\nfind economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that\nthe distinction that the statute makes between citizens\nand noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The\nstate FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which\nthose who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citi-\nzens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting\nfrom the public officials to whom they delegate the exer-\ncise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, §2; Va. Code\nAnn. §2.2–3700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the\nuse of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that\nVirginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underly-\ning recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n53–54. The challenged provision of the state FOIA does\nnot violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply\nbecause it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens\nof other States from making a profit by trading on in-\nformation contained in state records. While the Clause\nforbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a\ncompetitive advantage in business or employment, the\nClause does not require that a State tailor its every action\nto avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.\n                               B\n  Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of\nthe Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer\nproperty in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue\na common calling, the right to “take, hold and dispose of\nproperty, either real or personal,” has long been seen as\none of the privileges of citizenship. See Corfield v. Coryell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Under Virginia\nlaw, “any records and papers of every circuit court that are\nmaintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open\nto inspection by any person and the clerk shall, when\nrequested, furnish copies thereof.” Va. Code Ann. §17.1–\n208 (Lexis 2010). Such records and papers include records\nof property transfers, like title documents, §55–106 (Lexis\n2012); notices of federal tax liens and other federal liens\nagainst property, §55–142.1; notices of state tax liens\nagainst property, §58.1–314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes\ngenerally), §58.1–908 (estate tax liens), §58.1–1805 (state\ntaxes generally), §58.1–2021(A) (liens filed by agencies\nother than the Tax Commission); and notice of mortgages\nand other encumbrances, §8.01–241 (Lexis Supp. 2012).\n   A similar flaw undermines Hurlbert’s claim that Vir-\nginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by pre-\nventing citizens of other States from accessing real estate\ntax assessment records.

Henrico County, from which Hurlbert\nsought real estate tax assessments, follows this practice,2\nas does almost every other county in the Commonwealth.\nRequiring noncitizens to conduct a few minutes of Internet\nresearch in lieu of using a relatively cumbersome state\nFOIA process cannot be said to impose any significant\nburden on noncitizens’ ability to own or transfer property\nin Virginia.\n                            C\n   McBurney alleges that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision impermissibly burdens his “access to public\nproceedings.” Brief for Petitioners 42. McBurney is cor-\nrect that the Privileges and Immunities Clause “secures\ncitizens of one State the right to resort to the courts of\nanother, equally with the citizens of the latter State.”\nMissouri Pacific R.

Neither at oral argu-\nment nor in its briefs did Virginia cite any Virginia statute providing\nthat real estate tax assessment records be filed in the clerk’s office.\nVirginia Code Ann. §58.1–3300 (Lexis 2009), which directs that “reas-\nsessment” records be filed with the clerk, may be the statute to which\ncounsel referred, but without an official construction of the statute by\nVirginia’s Supreme Court—and, in light of the fact that petitioners\nhave not been afforded an opportunity to rebut its importance—we do\nnot rely upon it here.\n  2 See http://www.co.henrico.va.us/finance/disclaimer.html (as visited\n\nApril 26, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Rather, the Court has\nmade clear that “the constitutional requirement is sat-\nisfied if the non-resident is given access to the courts of\nthe State upon terms which in themselves are reasonable\nand adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have,\neven though they may not be technically and precisely the\nsame in extent as those accorded to resident citizens.”\nCanadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562\n(1920).\n   The challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA clearly\ndoes not deprive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate”\naccess to the Commonwealth’s courts. Virginia’s rules of\ncivil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct.\nRule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.\nThere is no reason to think that those mechanisms are\ninsufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant,\nnonprivileged documents needed in litigation.\n   Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens\nalike access to judicial records.

And if\nVirginia has in its possession information about any per-\nson, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another\nState, that person has the right under the Government\nData Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to in-\nspect that information. §2.2–3806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).\n   McBurney’s own case is illustrative.

Accordingly, Virginia’s\ncitizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly bur-\nden noncitizens’ ability to access the Commonwealth’s\ncourts.\n                              D\n   Finally, we reject petitioners’ sweeping claim that the\nchallenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them\nthe right to access public information on equal terms with\ncitizens of the Commonwealth. We cannot agree that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause covers this broad right.\n   This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no\nconstitutional right to obtain all the information provided\nby FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1,\n14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (“ ‘The Constitution itself is\n[not] a Freedom of Information Act’ ”); see also Los Angeles\nPolice Dept. v.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 8) (“[T]his Court has never found that the First\nAmendment prohibits the government from restricting the\nuse of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory\nmandate”).\n   It certainly cannot be said that such a broad right has\n“at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several\nstates which compose this Union, from the time of their\nbecoming free, independent, and sovereign.” Corfield, 6\nF. Cas., at 551. No such right was recognized at common\nlaw. See H.

Most founding-era English cases\nprovided that only those persons who had a personal\ninterest in non-judicial records were permitted to access\nthem. See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T.

S., at 388.\nFOIA laws are of relatively recent vintage. The federal\nFOIA was enacted in 1966, §1, 80 Stat. 383, and Virginia’s\ncounterpart was adopted two years later, 1968 Va. Acts ch.\n479, p. 690. There is no contention that the Nation’s unity\nfoundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now\nbecause of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several\nStates have enacted.\n                             III\n   In addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause\nclaim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia’s citizens-only\nFOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Commerce Clause empowers Congress “[t]o regulate\nCommerce . . . among the several States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3.\nThe Commerce Clause does not expressly impose any\nconstraints on “the several States,” and several Members\nof the Court have expressed the view that it does not do so.\nSee General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 312\n(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“[T]he so-called ‘negative’\nCommerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention,\nnot to be expanded beyond its existing domain”); United\nHaulers Assn.

J.)\n(dictum).\n   Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence “signifi-\ncantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate\nor otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.”\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151 (1986). It is driven by\na concern about “economic protectionism—that is, regula-\ntory measures designed to benefit in-state economic inter-\nests by burdening out-of-state competitors.” New Energy\nCo. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273–274 (1988); see\nalso Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)\n(“The crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determining\nwhether [the challenged statute] is basically a protection-\nist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law\ndirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon\ninterstate commerce that are only incidental”).\n   Virginia’s FOIA law neither “regulates” nor “burdens”\ninterstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service\nto local citizens that would not otherwise be available at\nall. The “common thread” among those cases in which the\nCourt has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation\nis that “the State interfered with the natural functioning\nof the interstate market either through prohibition or\nthrough burdensome regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria\nScrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806 (1976). Here, by contrast,\nVirginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market\nnor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.\nRather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens\ncopies—which would not otherwise exist—of state records.\nAs discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia’s\nFOIA law is to “ensur[e] the people of the Commonwealth\nready access to public records in the custody of a public\n14                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbody or its officers and employees, and free entry to meet-\nings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is\nbeing conducted.” Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B). This case\nis thus most properly brought under the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question\nwhether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit\nthat it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf. Missouri\nPacific R. Co., 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the\nprivilege of access to a State’s courts must be made avail-\nable to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the\nrelevant State). Because it does not pose the question of\nthe constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an\ninterstate market through prohibition or burdensome\nregulations, this case is not governed by the dormant\nCommerce Clause.\n   Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause\nframework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar\nas there is a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it\nis a market for a product that the Commonwealth has\ncreated and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manu-\nfacturer. We have held that a State does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause when, having created a mar-\nket through a state program, it “limits benefits generated\nby [that] state program to those who fund the state treas-\nury and whom the State was created to serve.” Reeves,\nInc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442 (1980). “Such policies,\nwhile perhaps ‘protectionist’ in a loose sense, reflect the\nessential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state\ngovernment—to serve the citizens of the State.” Ibid.; cf.\nDepartment of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328,\n341 (2008) (“[A] government function is not susceptible to\nstandard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its\nlikely motivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the\nsimple economic protectionism the Clause abhors”).

Argued February 20, 2013—Decided April 29, 2013\nVirginia’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens\n  access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-\n  Virginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States\n  other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act. After each\n  petitioner’s request was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit\n  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\n  leges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the dormant\n  Commerce Clause. The District Court granted Virginia’s motion for\n  summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are\n “fundamental.” See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont.,\n 436 U. S. 371, 382, 388. Pp. 3–12.\n       (a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges his fundamen-\n tal right to earn a living in his chosen profession—obtaining property\n records on behalf of his clients. While the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause protects the right of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their\n occupation, or pursue a common calling,” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S.\n 518, 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege\n only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burden-\n ing out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,\n 395, 397. The Virginia FOIA’s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a\n nonprotectionist aim. Virginia’s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism\n2                         MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public offi-\n    cials; noncitizens have no comparable need. Moreover, the distinc-\n    tion between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone\n    foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Com-\n    monwealth. Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other\n    States from making a profit by trading on information contained in\n    state records is incidental. Pp. 4–6.\n         (b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia’s FOIA abridges the right\n    to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth. The right to\n    take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the\n    privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.\n    However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining\n    documents necessary to the transfer of property. Records—like title\n    and mortgage documents—maintained by the clerk of each circuit\n    court are available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax as-\n    sessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted\n    online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought\n    records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk’s\n    office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA pro-\n    cess, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to\n    own or transfer property in Virginia. Pp. 6–8.\n         (c) McBurney alleges that Virginia’s FOIA impermissibly bur-\n    dens his access to public proceedings. The Privileges and Immunities\n    Clause “secures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts\n    of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,” Missouri Pa-\n    cific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257 U. S. 533, 535, but that\n    “requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access . . . upon\n    terms which . . . are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any\n    rights he may have, even though they may not be . . . the same in ex-\n    tent as those accorded to resident citizens,” Canadian Northern R.\n    Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562. Virginia’s FOIA clearly does not de-\n    prive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate” access to Common-\n    wealth courts. Virginia’s court rules provide noncitizens access to\n    nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law\n    gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to\n    records pertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized\n    Virginia’s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\n    Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA re-\n    quest. Pp. 8–10.\n         (d) Petitioners’ sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates\n    the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the\n    right to access public information on equal terms with Common-\n    wealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public infor-\n    mation is not a “fundamental” privilege or immunity of citizenship.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept.\n  v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 40. Moreover, no\n  such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.\n  Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the maintenance or well-being\n  of the Union.” Baldwin, supra, at 388.

Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  The “common thread” among this Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\n  cases is that “the State interfered with the natural functioning of the\n  interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome\n  regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806.\n  Virginia’s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate\n  market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market. Accord-\n  ingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause\n  case. Even shoehorned into the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\n  framework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar as there is\n  a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a\n  product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Com-\n  monwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not violate the\n  dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a\n  state program, it “limits benefits generated by [that] state program to\n  those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to\n  serve.” Reeves, Inc. v.

Code Ann. §2.2–3700 et seq.,\nviolates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\nArticle IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce\nClause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nprovides that “all public records shall be open to inspection\nand copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,” but\nit grants no such right to non-Virginians. §2.2–3704(A)\n(Lexis 2011).\n   Petitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccess-\nfully sought information under the Act and then brought\nthis constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that\npetitioners’ constitutional rights were not violated. By\nmeans other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available\nto petitioners most of the information that they sought,\nand the Commonwealth’s refusal to furnish the additional\ninformation did not abridge any constitutionally protected\nprivilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dor-\n2                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Informa-\ntion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful\nsense, but instead provides a service that is related to\nstate citizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners’ constitu-\ntional claims.\n                               I\n   Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W. Hurlbert\nare citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively.\nMcBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under\nthe Virginia FOIA, but their requests were denied because\nof their citizenship.\n   McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose ex-wife\nis a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her\nchild support obligations, McBurney asked the Common-\nwealth’s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a\npetition for child support on his behalf. The agency com-\nplied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attrib-\nutes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him\nnine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for\nthe agency’s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA re-\nquest seeking “all emails, notes, files, memos, reports,\nletters, policies, [and] opinions” pertaining to his family,\nalong with all documents “regarding [his] application for\nchild support” and all documents pertaining to the han-\ndling of child support claims like his. App. in No. 11–1099\n(CA4), p. 39A. The agency denied McBurney’s request on\nthe ground that he was not a Virginia citizen. McBurney\nlater requested the same documents under Virginia’s Gov-\nernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,\nVa. Code Ann. §2.2–3800 et seq., and through that re-\nquest he received most of the information he had sought\nthat pertained specifically to his own case. He did not,\nhowever, receive any general policy information about how\nthe agency handled claims like his.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Hurlbert is the sole proprietor of Sage Information\nServices, a business that requests real estate tax records\non clients’ behalf from state and local governments across\nthe United States. In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a\nland/title company to obtain real estate tax records for\nproperties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia\nFOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County\nReal Estate Assessor’s Office, but his request was denied\nbecause he was not a Virginia citizen.\n   Petitioners filed suit under 42 U. S. C. §1983, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\nleges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the\ndormant Commerce Clause. The District Court granted\nVirginia’s motion for summary judgment, McBurney v.\nCuccinelli, 780 F. Supp. 2d 439 (ED Va. 2011), and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, 667 F. 3d 454 (CA4 2012).\n   Like Virginia, several other States have enacted free-\ndom of information laws that are available only to their\ncitizens. See, e.g., Ala. Code §36–12–40 (2012 Cum.\nSupp.); Ark. Code Ann. §25–19–105 (2011 Supp.); Del.\nCode Ann., Tit. 29, §10003 (2012 Supp.); Mo. Rev. Stat.\n§109.180 (2012); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §91–A:4 (West\n2012); N. J. Stat. Ann. §47:1A–1 (West 2003); Tenn. Code\nAnn. §10–7–503 (2012). In Lee v. Minner, 458 F. 3d 194\n(2006), the Third Circuit held that this feature of Dela-\nware’s FOIA violated the Privileges and Immunities\nClause. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 568\nU. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, “[t]he Citi-\nzens of each State [are] entitled to all Privileges and Im-\nmunities of Citizens in the several States.” U. S. Const.,\nArt. IV, §2, cl. 1. We have said that “[t]he object of\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause is to ‘strongly . . .\nconstitute the citizens of the United States [as] one peo-\n4                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nple,’ by ‘plac[ing] the citizens of each State upon the same\nfooting with citizens of other States, so far as the ad-\nvantages resulting from citizenship in those States are\nconcerned.’ ” Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal,\n522 U. S. 287, 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia, 8\nWall. 168, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have\ncautioned, that “state citizenship or residency may never\nbe used by a State to distinguish among persons.” Bald-\nwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371,\n383 (1978). “Nor must a State always apply all its laws or\nall its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident,\nwho may request it so to do.” Ibid. Rather, we have long\nheld that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects\nonly those privileges and immunities that are “fundamen-\ntal.” See, e.g., id., at 382, 388.\n  Petitioners allege that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision violates four different “fundamental” privileges\nor immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common call-\ning, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the\nVirginia courts, and access to public information. The first\nthree items on that list, however, are not abridged by the\nVirginia FOIA, and the fourth—framed broadly—is not\nprotected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n                              A\n   Hurlbert argues that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA pro-\nvision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen\nprofession, namely, obtaining property records from state\nand local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct\nthat the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the\nright of citizens to “ply their trade, practice their occupa-\ntion, or pursue a common calling.” Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437\nU. S. 518, 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper, 470\nU. S. 274, 280 (1985) (“ ‘[O]ne of the privileges which the\nClause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing\nbusiness in State B on terms of substantial equality with\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe citizens of that State’ ”). But the Virginia FOIA does\nnot abridge Hulbert’s ability to engage in a common call-\ning in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immuni-\nties Clause. Rather, the Court has struck laws down as\nviolating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only\nwhen those laws were enacted for the protectionist pur-\npose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Hicklin,\nsupra, (striking down as a violation of noncitizens’ privi-\nleges and immunities an “Alaska Hire” statute containing\na resident hiring preference for all employment related to\nthe development of the State’s oil and gas resources);\nToomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395, 397 (1948) (striking\ndown a South Carolina statute imposing a $2,500 license\nfee on out-of-state shrimping boats and only a $25 fee on\nin-state shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that\nthe “purpose and effect of this statute . . . [was] not to\nconserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby\ncreate a commercial monopoly for South Carolina resi-\ndents,” and the “record cas[t] some doubt on” the State’s\ncounterassertion that the statute’s “obvious purpose was\nto conserve its shrimp supply”); United Building & Constr.\nTrades Council of Camden Cty. v. Mayor and Council of\nCamden, 465 U. S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal\nordinance requiring that at least 40% of employees of\ncontractors and subcontractors working on city construc-\ntion projects be city residents facially burdened out-of-\nstate citizens’ ability to pursue a common calling). In each\ncase, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to ad-\nvantage in-state workers and commercial interests at the\nexpense of their out-of-state counterparts.\n   Virginia’s FOIA differs sharply from those statutes. By\nits own terms, Virginia’s FOIA was enacted to “ensur[e]\nthe people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies\nwherein the business of the people is being conducted.”\n6                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVa. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does\nnot allege—and has offered no proof—that the challenged\nprovision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to\nprovide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia\ncitizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 67\n(2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to\nfind economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that\nthe distinction that the statute makes between citizens\nand noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The\nstate FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which\nthose who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citi-\nzens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting\nfrom the public officials to whom they delegate the exer-\ncise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, §2; Va. Code\nAnn. §2.2–3700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the\nuse of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that\nVirginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underly-\ning recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n53–54. The challenged provision of the state FOIA does\nnot violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply\nbecause it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens\nof other States from making a profit by trading on in-\nformation contained in state records. While the Clause\nforbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a\ncompetitive advantage in business or employment, the\nClause does not require that a State tailor its every action\nto avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.\n                               B\n  Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of\nthe Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer\nproperty in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue\na common calling, the right to “take, hold and dispose of\nproperty, either real or personal,” has long been seen as\none of the privileges of citizenship. See Corfield v. Coryell,\n6 F. Cas. 546, 552 (No. 3, 230) (CCED Pa. 1825); see also\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPaul, supra, at 180 (listing “the acquisition and enjoyment\nof property” among the privileges of citizenship). Thus,\nif a State prevented out-of-state citizens from accessing\nrecords—like title documents and mortgage records—that\nare necessary to the transfer of property, the State might\nwell run afoul of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\nCf. State v. Grimes, 29 Nev. 50, 85, 84 P. 1061, 1073 (1906)\n(“Caveat emptor being the rule with us in the absence of a\nspecial agreement, it is just and essential to the protection\nof persons intending to purchase or take incumbrances\nthat they be allowed the right of inspection”); Jackson ex\ndem. Center v. Campbell, 19 Johns. 281, 283 (N. Y. 1822)\n(the “plain intention” of the State’s property records sys-\ntem was “to give notice, through the medium of the county\nrecords, to persons about to purchase”).\n   Virginia, however, does not prevent citizens of other\nStates from obtaining such documents. Under Virginia\nlaw, “any records and papers of every circuit court that are\nmaintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open\nto inspection by any person and the clerk shall, when\nrequested, furnish copies thereof.” Va. Code Ann. §17.1–\n208 (Lexis 2010). Such records and papers include records\nof property transfers, like title documents, §55–106 (Lexis\n2012); notices of federal tax liens and other federal liens\nagainst property, §55–142.1; notices of state tax liens\nagainst property, §58.1–314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes\ngenerally), §58.1–908 (estate tax liens), §58.1–1805 (state\ntaxes generally), §58.1–2021(A) (liens filed by agencies\nother than the Tax Commission); and notice of mortgages\nand other encumbrances, §8.01–241 (Lexis Supp. 2012).\n   A similar flaw undermines Hurlbert’s claim that Vir-\nginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by pre-\nventing citizens of other States from accessing real estate\ntax assessment records. It is true that those records,\nwhile available to Virginia citizens under the state FOIA,\nare not required by statute to be made available to noncit-\n8                      MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nizens. See Associated Tax Service, Inc. v. Fitzpatrick, 236\nVa. 181, 183, 187, 372 S. E. 2d 625, 627, 629 (1988).1 But\nin fact Virginia and its subdivisions generally make even\nthese less essential records readily available to all. These\nrecords are considered nonconfidential under Virginia law\nand, accordingly, they may be posted online. §58.1–3122.2\n(Lexis 2009).    Henrico County, from which Hurlbert\nsought real estate tax assessments, follows this practice,2\nas does almost every other county in the Commonwealth.\nRequiring noncitizens to conduct a few minutes of Internet\nresearch in lieu of using a relatively cumbersome state\nFOIA process cannot be said to impose any significant\nburden on noncitizens’ ability to own or transfer property\nin Virginia.\n                            C\n   McBurney alleges that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision impermissibly burdens his “access to public\nproceedings.” Brief for Petitioners 42. McBurney is cor-\nrect that the Privileges and Immunities Clause “secures\ncitizens of one State the right to resort to the courts of\nanother, equally with the citizens of the latter State.”\nMissouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257\nU. S. 533, 535 (1922). But petitioners do not suggest that\n\n——————\n  1 At oral argument, the Solicitor General of Virginia contended that,\n\nas a matter of Virginia law, Hurlbert “is entitled to the tax assessment\ndata in the clerk’s office.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. Neither at oral argu-\nment nor in its briefs did Virginia cite any Virginia statute providing\nthat real estate tax assessment records be filed in the clerk’s office.\nVirginia Code Ann. §58.1–3300 (Lexis 2009), which directs that “reas-\nsessment” records be filed with the clerk, may be the statute to which\ncounsel referred, but without an official construction of the statute by\nVirginia’s Supreme Court—and, in light of the fact that petitioners\nhave not been afforded an opportunity to rebut its importance—we do\nnot rely upon it here.\n  2 See http://www.co.henrico.va.us/finance/disclaimer.html (as visited\n\nApril 26, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Virginia FOIA slams the courthouse door on nonciti-\nzens; rather, the most they claim is that the law creates\n“[a]n information asymmetry between adversaries based\nsolely on state citizenship.” Brief for Petitioners 42.\n   The Privileges and Immunities Clause does not require\nStates to erase any distinction between citizens and non-\ncitizens that might conceivably give state citizens some\ndetectable litigation advantage. Rather, the Court has\nmade clear that “the constitutional requirement is sat-\nisfied if the non-resident is given access to the courts of\nthe State upon terms which in themselves are reasonable\nand adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have,\neven though they may not be technically and precisely the\nsame in extent as those accorded to resident citizens.”\nCanadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562\n(1920).\n   The challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA clearly\ndoes not deprive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate”\naccess to the Commonwealth’s courts. Virginia’s rules of\ncivil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct.\nRule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.\nThere is no reason to think that those mechanisms are\ninsufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant,\nnonprivileged documents needed in litigation.\n   Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens\nalike access to judicial records. Va. Code Ann. §17.1–208;\nsee also Shenandoah Publishing House, Inc. v. Fanning,\n235 Va. 253, 258, 368 S. E. 2d 253, 256 (1988). And if\nVirginia has in its possession information about any per-\nson, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another\nState, that person has the right under the Government\nData Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to in-\nspect that information. §2.2–3806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).\n   McBurney’s own case is illustrative. When his FOIA\nrequest was denied, McBurney was told that he should\nrequest the materials he sought pursuant to the Govern-\n10                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.\nUpon placing a request under that Act, he ultimately\nreceived much of what he sought. Accordingly, Virginia’s\ncitizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly bur-\nden noncitizens’ ability to access the Commonwealth’s\ncourts.\n                              D\n   Finally, we reject petitioners’ sweeping claim that the\nchallenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them\nthe right to access public information on equal terms with\ncitizens of the Commonwealth. We cannot agree that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause covers this broad right.\n   This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no\nconstitutional right to obtain all the information provided\nby FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1,\n14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (“ ‘The Constitution itself is\n[not] a Freedom of Information Act’ ”); see also Los Angeles\nPolice Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528\nU. S. 32, 40 (1999) (the Government could decide “not to\ngive out [this] information at all”); Sorrell v. IMS Health\nInc., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 8) (“[T]his Court has never found that the First\nAmendment prohibits the government from restricting the\nuse of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory\nmandate”).\n   It certainly cannot be said that such a broad right has\n“at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several\nstates which compose this Union, from the time of their\nbecoming free, independent, and sovereign.” Corfield, 6\nF. Cas., at 551. No such right was recognized at common\nlaw. See H. Cross, The People’s Right to Know 25 (1953)\n(“[T]he courts declared the primary rule that there was no\ngeneral common law right in all persons (as citizens,\ntaxpayers, electors or merely as persons) to inspect public\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Most founding-era English cases\nprovided that only those persons who had a personal\ninterest in non-judicial records were permitted to access\nthem. See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T. R. 141, 142, 100 Eng.\nRep. 498, 499 (K. B. 1789) (Buller, J.) (“[O]ne man has no\nright to look into another’s title deeds and records, when\nhe . . . has no interest in the deeds or rolls himself ”); King\nv. Justices of Staffordshire, 6 Ad. & E. 84, 101, 112 Eng.\nRep. 33, 39 (K. B. 1837) (“The utmost . . . that can be said\non the ground of interest, is that the applicants have a\nrational curiosity to gratify by this inspection, or that they\nmay thereby ascertain facts useful to them in advancing\nsome ulterior measures in contemplation as to regulating\ncounty expenditure; but this is merely an interest in ob-\ntaining information on the general subject, and would\nfurnish an equally good reason for permitting inspection of\nthe records of any other county: there is not that direct\nand tangible interest, which is necessary to bring them\nwithin the rule on which the Court acts in granting in-\nspection of public documents”).\n  Nineteenth-century American cases, while less uniform,\ncertainly do not support the proposition that a broad-\nbased right to access public information was widely recog-\nnized in the early Republic. See, e.g., Cormack v. Wolcott,\n37 Kan. 391, 394, 15 P. 245, 246 (1887) (denying manda-\nmus to plaintiff seeking to compile abstracts of title rec-\nords; “At common law, parties had no vested rights in the\nexamination of a record of title, or other public records,\nsave by some interest in the land or subject of record”);\nBrewer v. Watson, 71 Ala. 299, 305 (1882) (“The individual\ndemanding access to, and inspection of public writings\nmust not only have an interest in the matters to which\nthey relate, a direct, tangible interest, but the inspection\nmust be sought for some specific and legitimate purpose.\nThe gratification of mere curiosity, or motives merely\nspeculative will not entitle him to demand an examination\n12                 MCBURNEY v.

S., at 388.\nFOIA laws are of relatively recent vintage. The federal\nFOIA was enacted in 1966, §1, 80 Stat. 383, and Virginia’s\ncounterpart was adopted two years later, 1968 Va. Acts ch.\n479, p. 690. There is no contention that the Nation’s unity\nfoundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now\nbecause of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several\nStates have enacted.\n                             III\n   In addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause\nclaim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia’s citizens-only\nFOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Commerce Clause empowers Congress “[t]o regulate\nCommerce . . . among the several States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3.\nThe Commerce Clause does not expressly impose any\nconstraints on “the several States,” and several Members\nof the Court have expressed the view that it does not do so.\nSee General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 312\n(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“[T]he so-called ‘negative’\nCommerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention,\nnot to be expanded beyond its existing domain”); United\nHaulers Assn. Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Man-\nagement Authority, 550 U. S. 330, 349 (2007) (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (“The negative Commerce Clause\nhas no basis in the Constitution and has proved unwork-\nable in practice”). Nonetheless, the Court has long inferred\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Commerce Clause itself imposes certain implicit\nlimitations on state power. See, e.g., Cooley v. Board of\nWardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of\nDistressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318–319 (1852); cf. Gib-\nbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.)\n(dictum).\n   Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence “signifi-\ncantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate\nor otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.”\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151 (1986). It is driven by\na concern about “economic protectionism—that is, regula-\ntory measures designed to benefit in-state economic inter-\nests by burdening out-of-state competitors.” New Energy\nCo. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273–274 (1988); see\nalso Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)\n(“The crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determining\nwhether [the challenged statute] is basically a protection-\nist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law\ndirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon\ninterstate commerce that are only incidental”).\n   Virginia’s FOIA law neither “regulates” nor “burdens”\ninterstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service\nto local citizens that would not otherwise be available at\nall. The “common thread” among those cases in which the\nCourt has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation\nis that “the State interfered with the natural functioning\nof the interstate market either through prohibition or\nthrough burdensome regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria\nScrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806 (1976). Here, by contrast,\nVirginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market\nnor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.\nRather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens\ncopies—which would not otherwise exist—of state records.\nAs discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia’s\nFOIA law is to “ensur[e] the people of the Commonwealth\nready access to public records in the custody of a public\n14                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbody or its officers and employees, and free entry to meet-\nings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is\nbeing conducted.” Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3700(B). This case\nis thus most properly brought under the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question\nwhether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit\nthat it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf. Missouri\nPacific R. Co., 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the\nprivilege of access to a State’s courts must be made avail-\nable to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the\nrelevant State). Because it does not pose the question of\nthe constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an\ninterstate market through prohibition or burdensome\nregulations, this case is not governed by the dormant\nCommerce Clause.\n   Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause\nframework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar\nas there is a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it\nis a market for a product that the Commonwealth has\ncreated and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manu-\nfacturer. We have held that a State does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause when, having created a mar-\nket through a state program, it “limits benefits generated\nby [that] state program to those who fund the state treas-\nury and whom the State was created to serve.” Reeves,\nInc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442 (1980). “Such policies,\nwhile perhaps ‘protectionist’ in a loose sense, reflect the\nessential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state\ngovernment—to serve the citizens of the State.” Ibid.; cf.\nDepartment of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328,\n341 (2008) (“[A] government function is not susceptible to\nstandard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its\nlikely motivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the\nsimple economic protectionism the Clause abhors”). For\nthese reasons, Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA provision does\nnot violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
