Argued February 20, 2013\u2014Decided April 29, 2013\nVirginia\u2019s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens\n  access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-\n  Virginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States\n  other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act. After each\n  petitioner\u2019s request was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 suit\n  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\n  leges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert\u2019s case, the dormant\n  Commerce Clause. The District Court granted Virginia\u2019s motion for\n  summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Virginia\u2019s FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are\n \u201cfundamental.\u201d See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm\u2019n of Mont.,\n 436 U. S. 371, 382, 388. Pp. 3\u201312.\n       (a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA abridges his fundamen-\n tal right to earn a living in his chosen profession\u2014obtaining property\n records on behalf of his clients. While the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause protects the right of citizens to \u201cply their trade, practice their\n occupation, or pursue a common calling,\u201d Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S.\n 518, 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege\n only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burden-\n ing out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,\n 395, 397. The Virginia FOIA\u2019s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a\n nonprotectionist aim. Virginia\u2019s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism\n2                         MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public offi-\n    cials; noncitizens have no comparable need. Moreover, the distinc-\n    tion between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone\n    foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Com-\n    monwealth. Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other\n    States from making a profit by trading on information contained in\n    state records is incidental. Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA abridges the right\n    to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth. The right to\n    take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the\n    privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180.\n    However, Virginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining\n    documents necessary to the transfer of property. Records\u2014like title\n    and mortgage documents\u2014maintained by the clerk of each circuit\n    court are available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax as-\n    sessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted\n    online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought\n    records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk\u2019s\n    office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA pro-\n    cess, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to\n    own or transfer property in Virginia. Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (c) McBurney alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA impermissibly bur-\n    dens his access to public proceedings. The Privileges and Immunities\n    Clause \u201csecures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts\n    of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,\u201d Missouri Pa-\n    cific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257 U. S. 533, 535, but that\n    \u201crequirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access . . . upon\n    terms which . . . are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any\n    rights he may have, even though they may not be . . . the same in ex-\n    tent as those accorded to resident citizens,\u201d Canadian Northern R.\n    Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562. Virginia\u2019s FOIA clearly does not de-\n    prive noncitizens of \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d access to Common-\n    wealth courts. Virginia\u2019s court rules provide noncitizens access to\n    nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law\n    gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to\n    records pertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized\n    Virginia\u2019s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\n    Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA re-\n    quest. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (d) Petitioners\u2019 sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates\n    the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the\n    right to access public information on equal terms with Common-\n    wealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public infor-\n    mation is not a \u201cfundamental\u201d privilege or immunity of citizenship.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  The Court has repeatedly stated that the Constitution does not guar-\n  antee the existence of FOIA laws. See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept.\n  v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 40. Moreover, no\n  such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.\n  Nor is such a sweeping right \u201cbasic to the maintenance or well-being\n  of the Union.\u201d Baldwin, supra, at 388. Pp. 10\u201312.\n     2. Virginia\u2019s FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  The \u201ccommon thread\u201d among this Court\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause\n  cases is that \u201cthe State interfered with the natural functioning of the\n  interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome\n  regulation.\u201d Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806.\n  Virginia\u2019s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate\n  market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market. Accord-\n  ingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause\n  case. Even shoehorned into the Court\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause\n  framework, however, Hurlbert\u2019s claim would fail. Insofar as there is\n  a \u201cmarket\u201d for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a\n  product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Com-\n  monwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not violate the\n  dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a\n  state program, it \u201climits benefits generated by [that] state program to\n  those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to\n  serve.\u201d Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442. Pp. 12\u201314.\n667 F. 3d 454, affirmed.\n\n   ALITO, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

MCBURNEY, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. NA-\n\n   THANIEL L. YOUNG, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER \n\n     AND DIRECTOR, VIRGINIA DIVISION OF\n\n     CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [April 29, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In this case, we must decide whether the Virginia Free-\ndom of Information Act, Va. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700 et seq.,\nviolates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\nArticle IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce\nClause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nprovides that \u201call public records shall be open to inspection\nand copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,\u201d but\nit grants no such right to non-Virginians. \u00a72.2\u20133704(A)\n(Lexis 2011).\n   Petitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccess-\nfully sought information under the Act and then brought\nthis constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional rights were not violated. By\nmeans other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available\nto petitioners most of the information that they sought,\nand the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to furnish the additional\ninformation did not abridge any constitutionally protected\nprivilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dor-\n2                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Informa-\ntion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful\nsense, but instead provides a service that is related to\nstate citizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners\u2019 constitu-\ntional claims.\n                               I\n   Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W. Hurlbert\nare citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively.\nMcBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under\nthe Virginia FOIA, but their requests were denied because\nof their citizenship.\n   McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose ex-wife\nis a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her\nchild support obligations, McBurney asked the Common-\nwealth\u2019s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a\npetition for child support on his behalf. The agency com-\nplied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attrib-\nutes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him\nnine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for\nthe agency\u2019s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA re-\nquest seeking \u201call emails, notes, files, memos, reports,\nletters, policies, [and] opinions\u201d pertaining to his family,\nalong with all documents \u201cregarding [his] application for\nchild support\u201d and all documents pertaining to the han-\ndling of child support claims like his. App. in No. 11\u20131099\n(CA4), p. 39A. The agency denied McBurney\u2019s request on\nthe ground that he was not a Virginia citizen. McBurney\nlater requested the same documents under Virginia\u2019s Gov-\nernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,\nVa. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133800 et seq., and through that re-\nquest he received most of the information he had sought\nthat pertained specifically to his own case. He did not,\nhowever, receive any general policy information about how\nthe agency handled claims like his.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Hurlbert is the sole proprietor of Sage Information\nServices, a business that requests real estate tax records\non clients\u2019 behalf from state and local governments across\nthe United States. In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a\nland/title company to obtain real estate tax records for\nproperties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia\nFOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County\nReal Estate Assessor\u2019s Office, but his request was denied\nbecause he was not a Virginia citizen.\n   Petitioners filed suit under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983, seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\nleges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert\u2019s case, the\ndormant Commerce Clause. The District Court granted\nVirginia\u2019s motion for summary judgment, McBurney v.\nCuccinelli, 780 F. Supp. 2d 439 (ED Va. 2011), and the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed, 667 F. 3d 454 (CA4 2012).\n   Like Virginia, several other States have enacted free-\ndom of information laws that are available only to their\ncitizens. See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a736\u201312\u201340 (2012 Cum.\nSupp.); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a725\u201319\u2013105 (2011 Supp.); Del.\nCode Ann., Tit. 29, \u00a710003 (2012 Supp.); Mo. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a7109.180 (2012); N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a791\u2013A:4 (West\n2012); N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a747:1A\u20131 (West 2003); Tenn. Code\nAnn. \u00a710\u20137\u2013503 (2012). In Lee v. Minner, 458 F. 3d 194\n(2006), the Third Circuit held that this feature of Dela-\nware\u2019s FOIA violated the Privileges and Immunities\nClause. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 568\nU. S. ___ (2012).\n                             II\n  Under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, \u201c[t]he Citi-\nzens of each State [are] entitled to all Privileges and Im-\nmunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d U.

New York Tax Appeals Tribunal,\n522 U. S. 287, 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia, 8\nWall. 168, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have\ncautioned, that \u201cstate citizenship or residency may never\nbe used by a State to distinguish among persons.\u201d Bald-\nwin v. Fish and Game Comm\u2019n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371,\n383 (1978). \u201cNor must a State always apply all its laws or\nall its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident,\nwho may request it so to do.\u201d Ibid. Rather, we have long\nheld that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects\nonly those privileges and immunities that are \u201cfundamen-\ntal.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 382, 388.\n  Petitioners allege that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision violates four different \u201cfundamental\u201d privileges\nor immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common call-\ning, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the\nVirginia courts, and access to public information. The first\nthree items on that list, however, are not abridged by the\nVirginia FOIA, and the fourth\u2014framed broadly\u2014is not\nprotected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n                              A\n   Hurlbert argues that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA pro-\nvision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen\nprofession, namely, obtaining property records from state\nand local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct\nthat the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the\nright of citizens to \u201cply their trade, practice their occupa-\ntion, or pursue a common calling.\u201d Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437\nU. S. 518, 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper, 470\nU. S. 274, 280 (1985) (\u201c \u2018[O]ne of the privileges which the\nClause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing\nbusiness in State B on terms of substantial equality with\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

But the Virginia FOIA does\nnot abridge Hulbert\u2019s ability to engage in a common call-\ning in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immuni-\nties Clause. Rather, the Court has struck laws down as\nviolating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only\nwhen those laws were enacted for the protectionist pur-\npose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Hicklin,\nsupra, (striking down as a violation of noncitizens\u2019 privi-\nleges and immunities an \u201cAlaska Hire\u201d statute containing\na resident hiring preference for all employment related to\nthe development of the State\u2019s oil and gas resources);\nToomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395, 397 (1948) (striking\ndown a South Carolina statute imposing a $2,500 license\nfee on out-of-state shrimping boats and only a $25 fee on\nin-state shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that\nthe \u201cpurpose and effect of this statute . . . [was] not to\nconserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby\ncreate a commercial monopoly for South Carolina resi-\ndents,\u201d and the \u201crecord cas[t] some doubt on\u201d the State\u2019s\ncounterassertion that the statute\u2019s \u201cobvious purpose was\nto conserve its shrimp supply\u201d); United Building & Constr.\nTrades Council of Camden Cty. v. Mayor and Council of\nCamden, 465 U. S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal\nordinance requiring that at least 40% of employees of\ncontractors and subcontractors working on city construc-\ntion projects be city residents facially burdened out-of-\nstate citizens\u2019 ability to pursue a common calling). In each\ncase, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to ad-\nvantage in-state workers and commercial interests at the\nexpense of their out-of-state counterparts.\n   Virginia\u2019s FOIA differs sharply from those statutes. By\nits own terms, Virginia\u2019s FOIA was enacted to \u201censur[e]\nthe people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies\nwherein the business of the people is being conducted.\u201d\n6                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVa. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does\nnot allege\u2014and has offered no proof\u2014that the challenged\nprovision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to\nprovide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia\ncitizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 67\n(2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to\nfind economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that\nthe distinction that the statute makes between citizens\nand noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The\nstate FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which\nthose who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citi-\nzens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting\nfrom the public officials to whom they delegate the exer-\ncise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, \u00a72; Va. Code\nAnn. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the\nuse of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that\nVirginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underly-\ning recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n53\u201354. The challenged provision of the state FOIA does\nnot violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply\nbecause it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens\nof other States from making a profit by trading on in-\nformation contained in state records. While the Clause\nforbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a\ncompetitive advantage in business or employment, the\nClause does not require that a State tailor its every action\nto avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.\n                               B\n  Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of\nthe Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer\nproperty in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue\na common calling, the right to \u201ctake, hold and dispose of\nproperty, either real or personal,\u201d has long been seen as\none of the privileges of citizenship. See Corfield v. Coryell,\n6 F. Cas. 546, 552 (No. 3, 230) (CCED Pa. 1825); see also\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Thus,\nif a State prevented out-of-state citizens from accessing\nrecords\u2014like title documents and mortgage records\u2014that\nare necessary to the transfer of property, the State might\nwell run afoul of the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\nCf. State v. Grimes, 29 Nev. 50, 85, 84 P. 1061, 1073 (1906)\n(\u201cCaveat emptor being the rule with us in the absence of a\nspecial agreement, it is just and essential to the protection\nof persons intending to purchase or take incumbrances\nthat they be allowed the right of inspection\u201d); Jackson ex\ndem. Center v. Campbell, 19 Johns. 281, 283 (N. Y. 1822)\n(the \u201cplain intention\u201d of the State\u2019s property records sys-\ntem was \u201cto give notice, through the medium of the county\nrecords, to persons about to purchase\u201d).\n   Virginia, however, does not prevent citizens of other\nStates from obtaining such documents. Under Virginia\nlaw, \u201cany records and papers of every circuit court that are\nmaintained by the clerk of the circuit court shall be open\nto inspection by any person and the clerk shall, when\nrequested, furnish copies thereof.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a717.1\u2013\n208 (Lexis 2010). Such records and papers include records\nof property transfers, like title documents, \u00a755\u2013106 (Lexis\n2012); notices of federal tax liens and other federal liens\nagainst property, \u00a755\u2013142.1; notices of state tax liens\nagainst property, \u00a758.1\u2013314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes\ngenerally), \u00a758.1\u2013908 (estate tax liens), \u00a758.1\u20131805 (state\ntaxes generally), \u00a758.1\u20132021(A) (liens filed by agencies\nother than the Tax Commission); and notice of mortgages\nand other encumbrances, \u00a78.01\u2013241 (Lexis Supp. 2012).\n   A similar flaw undermines Hurlbert\u2019s claim that Vir-\nginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by pre-\nventing citizens of other States from accessing real estate\ntax assessment records. It is true that those records,\nwhile available to Virginia citizens under the state FOIA,\nare not required by statute to be made available to noncit-\n8                      MCBURNEY v.

E. 2d 625, 627, 629 (1988).1 But\nin fact Virginia and its subdivisions generally make even\nthese less essential records readily available to all. These\nrecords are considered nonconfidential under Virginia law\nand, accordingly, they may be posted online. \u00a758.1\u20133122.2\n(Lexis 2009).    Henrico County, from which Hurlbert\nsought real estate tax assessments, follows this practice,2\nas does almost every other county in the Commonwealth.\nRequiring noncitizens to conduct a few minutes of Internet\nresearch in lieu of using a relatively cumbersome state\nFOIA process cannot be said to impose any significant\nburden on noncitizens\u2019 ability to own or transfer property\nin Virginia.\n                            C\n   McBurney alleges that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision impermissibly burdens his \u201caccess to public\nproceedings.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 42. McBurney is cor-\nrect that the Privileges and Immunities Clause \u201csecures\ncitizens of one State the right to resort to the courts of\nanother, equally with the citizens of the latter State.\u201d\nMissouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257\nU. S. 533, 535 (1922). But petitioners do not suggest that\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 At oral argument, the Solicitor General of Virginia contended that,\n\nas a matter of Virginia law, Hurlbert \u201cis entitled to the tax assessment\ndata in the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 38. Neither at oral argu-\nment nor in its briefs did Virginia cite any Virginia statute providing\nthat real estate tax assessment records be filed in the clerk\u2019s office.\nVirginia Code Ann. \u00a758.1\u20133300 (Lexis 2009), which directs that \u201creas-\nsessment\u201d records be filed with the clerk, may be the statute to which\ncounsel referred, but without an official construction of the statute by\nVirginia\u2019s Supreme Court\u2014and, in light of the fact that petitioners\nhave not been afforded an opportunity to rebut its importance\u2014we do\nnot rely upon it here.\n  2 See http://www.co.henrico.va.us/finance/disclaimer.html (as visited\n\nApril 26, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Rather, the Court has\nmade clear that \u201cthe constitutional requirement is sat-\nisfied if the non-resident is given access to the courts of\nthe State upon terms which in themselves are reasonable\nand adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have,\neven though they may not be technically and precisely the\nsame in extent as those accorded to resident citizens.\u201d\nCanadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562\n(1920).\n   The challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA clearly\ndoes not deprive noncitizens of \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d\naccess to the Commonwealth\u2019s courts. Virginia\u2019s rules of\ncivil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct.\nRule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.\nThere is no reason to think that those mechanisms are\ninsufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant,\nnonprivileged documents needed in litigation.\n   Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens\nalike access to judicial records. Va. Code Ann. \u00a717.1\u2013208;\nsee also Shenandoah Publishing House, Inc. v. Fanning,\n235 Va. 253, 258, 368 S. E. 2d 253, 256 (1988). And if\nVirginia has in its possession information about any per-\nson, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another\nState, that person has the right under the Government\nData Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to in-\nspect that information. \u00a72.2\u20133806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).\n   McBurney\u2019s own case is illustrative. When his FOIA\nrequest was denied, McBurney was told that he should\nrequest the materials he sought pursuant to the Govern-\n10                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.\nUpon placing a request under that Act, he ultimately\nreceived much of what he sought. Accordingly, Virginia\u2019s\ncitizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly bur-\nden noncitizens\u2019 ability to access the Commonwealth\u2019s\ncourts.\n                              D\n   Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 sweeping claim that the\nchallenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them\nthe right to access public information on equal terms with\ncitizens of the Commonwealth. We cannot agree that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause covers this broad right.\n   This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no\nconstitutional right to obtain all the information provided\nby FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1,\n14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (\u201c \u2018The Constitution itself is\n[not] a Freedom of Information Act\u2019 \u201d); see also Los Angeles\nPolice Dept. v.

Most founding-era English cases\nprovided that only those persons who had a personal\ninterest in non-judicial records were permitted to access\nthem. See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T.

(\u201c[O]ne man has no\nright to look into another\u2019s title deeds and records, when\nhe . . . has no interest in the deeds or rolls himself \u201d); King\nv. Justices of Staffordshire, 6 Ad. & E. 84, 101, 112 Eng.\nRep. 33, 39 (K. B. 1837) (\u201cThe utmost . . . that can be said\non the ground of interest, is that the applicants have a\nrational curiosity to gratify by this inspection, or that they\nmay thereby ascertain facts useful to them in advancing\nsome ulterior measures in contemplation as to regulating\ncounty expenditure; but this is merely an interest in ob-\ntaining information on the general subject, and would\nfurnish an equally good reason for permitting inspection of\nthe records of any other county: there is not that direct\nand tangible interest, which is necessary to bring them\nwithin the rule on which the Court acts in granting in-\nspection of public documents\u201d).\n  Nineteenth-century American cases, while less uniform,\ncertainly do not support the proposition that a broad-\nbased right to access public information was widely recog-\nnized in the early Republic.

S., at 388.\nFOIA laws are of relatively recent vintage. The federal\nFOIA was enacted in 1966, \u00a71, 80 Stat. 383, and Virginia\u2019s\ncounterpart was adopted two years later, 1968 Va. Acts ch.\n479, p. 690. There is no contention that the Nation\u2019s unity\nfoundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now\nbecause of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several\nStates have enacted.\n                             III\n   In addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause\nclaim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only\nFOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Commerce Clause empowers Congress \u201c[t]o regulate\nCommerce . . . among the several States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 3.\nThe Commerce Clause does not expressly impose any\nconstraints on \u201cthe several States,\u201d and several Members\nof the Court have expressed the view that it does not do so.\nSee General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 312\n(1997) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he so-called \u2018negative\u2019\nCommerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention,\nnot to be expanded beyond its existing domain\u201d); United\nHaulers Assn.

Nonetheless, the Court has long inferred\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Commerce Clause itself imposes certain implicit\nlimitations on state power. See, e.g., Cooley v. Board of\nWardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of\nDistressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318\u2013319 (1852); cf. Gib-\nbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.)\n(dictum).\n   Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence \u201csignifi-\ncantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate\nor otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.\u201d\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151 (1986). It is driven by\na concern about \u201ceconomic protectionism\u2014that is, regula-\ntory measures designed to benefit in-state economic inter-\nests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d New Energy\nCo. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273\u2013274 (1988); see\nalso Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)\n(\u201cThe crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determining\nwhether [the challenged statute] is basically a protection-\nist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law\ndirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon\ninterstate commerce that are only incidental\u201d).\n   Virginia\u2019s FOIA law neither \u201cregulates\u201d nor \u201cburdens\u201d\ninterstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service\nto local citizens that would not otherwise be available at\nall. The \u201ccommon thread\u201d among those cases in which the\nCourt has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation\nis that \u201cthe State interfered with the natural functioning\nof the interstate market either through prohibition or\nthrough burdensome regulation.\u201d Hughes v. Alexandria\nScrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806 (1976). Here, by contrast,\nVirginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market\nnor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.\nRather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens\ncopies\u2014which would not otherwise exist\u2014of state records.\nAs discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia\u2019s\nFOIA law is to \u201censur[e] the people of the Commonwealth\nready access to public records in the custody of a public\n14                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbody or its officers and employees, and free entry to meet-\nings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is\nbeing conducted.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B). This case\nis thus most properly brought under the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question\nwhether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit\nthat it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf. Missouri\nPacific R. Co., 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the\nprivilege of access to a State\u2019s courts must be made avail-\nable to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the\nrelevant State). Because it does not pose the question of\nthe constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an\ninterstate market through prohibition or burdensome\nregulations, this case is not governed by the dormant\nCommerce Clause.\n   Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause\nframework, however, Hurlbert\u2019s claim would fail. Insofar\nas there is a \u201cmarket\u201d for public documents in Virginia, it\nis a market for a product that the Commonwealth has\ncreated and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manu-\nfacturer. We have held that a State does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause when, having created a mar-\nket through a state program, it \u201climits benefits generated\nby [that] state program to those who fund the state treas-\nury and whom the State was created to serve.\u201d Reeves,\nInc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442 (1980). \u201cSuch policies,\nwhile perhaps \u2018protectionist\u2019 in a loose sense, reflect the\nessential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state\ngovernment\u2014to serve the citizens of the State.\u201d Ibid.; cf.\nDepartment of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328,\n341 (2008) (\u201c[A] government function is not susceptible to\nstandard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its\nlikely motivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the\nsimple economic protectionism the Clause abhors\u201d).

Argued February 20, 2013\u2014Decided April 29, 2013\nVirginia\u2019s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants Virginia citizens\n  access to all public records, but grants no such right to non-\n  Virginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert, citizens of States\n  other than Virginia, filed records requests under the Act. After each\n  petitioner\u2019s request was denied, they filed a 42 U. S. C. \u00a71983 suit\n  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Privi-\n  leges and Immunities Clause and, in Hurlbert\u2019s case, the dormant\n  Commerce Clause. The District Court granted Virginia\u2019s motion for\n  summary judgment, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. Virginia\u2019s FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause, which protects only those privileges and immunities that are\n \u201cfundamental.\u201d See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm\u2019n of Mont.,\n 436 U. S. 371, 382, 388. Pp. 3\u201312.\n       (a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA abridges his fundamen-\n tal right to earn a living in his chosen profession\u2014obtaining property\n records on behalf of his clients. While the Privileges and Immunities\n Clause protects the right of citizens to \u201cply their trade, practice their\n occupation, or pursue a common calling,\u201d Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S.\n 518, 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this privilege\n only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose of burden-\n ing out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385,\n 395, 397. The Virginia FOIA\u2019s citizen/noncitizen distinction has a\n nonprotectionist aim. Virginia\u2019s FOIA exists to provide a mechanism\n2                         MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting from their public offi-\n    cials; noncitizens have no comparable need. Moreover, the distinc-\n    tion between citizens and noncitizens recognizes that citizens alone\n    foot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the Com-\n    monwealth. Any effect the Act has of preventing citizens of other\n    States from making a profit by trading on information contained in\n    state records is incidental. Pp. 4\u20136.\n         (b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA abridges the right\n    to own and transfer property in the Commonwealth. The right to\n    take, hold, and dispose of property has long been seen as one of the\n    privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v.

Records\u2014like title\n    and mortgage documents\u2014maintained by the clerk of each circuit\n    court are available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax as-\n    sessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often posted\n    online, a practice followed by the county from which Hurlbert sought\n    records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records through the clerk\u2019s\n    office or on the Internet, instead of through a burdensome FOIA pro-\n    cess, cannot be said to impose a significant burden on the ability to\n    own or transfer property in Virginia. Pp. 6\u20138.\n         (c) McBurney alleges that Virginia\u2019s FOIA impermissibly bur-\n    dens his access to public proceedings. The Privileges and Immunities\n    Clause \u201csecures citizens of one state the right to resort to the courts\n    of another, equally with the citizens of the latter state,\u201d Missouri Pa-\n    cific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co., 257 U. S. 533, 535, but that\n    \u201crequirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access . . . upon\n    terms which . . . are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any\n    rights he may have, even though they may not be . . . the same in ex-\n    tent as those accorded to resident citizens,\u201d Canadian Northern R.\n    Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562. Virginia\u2019s FOIA clearly does not de-\n    prive noncitizens of \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d access to Common-\n    wealth courts. Virginia\u2019s court rules provide noncitizens access to\n    nonpriviledged documents needed in litigation, and Virginia law\n    gives citizens and noncitizens alike access to judicial records and to\n    records pertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized\n    Virginia\u2019s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\n    Act to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA re-\n    quest. Pp. 8\u201310.\n         (d) Petitioners\u2019 sweeping claim that the Virginia FOIA violates\n    the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the\n    right to access public information on equal terms with Common-\n    wealth citizens is rejected because the right to access public infor-\n    mation is not a \u201cfundamental\u201d privilege or immunity of citizenship.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept.\n  v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528 U. S. 32, 40. Moreover, no\n  such right was recognized at common law or in the early Republic.\n  Nor is such a sweeping right \u201cbasic to the maintenance or well-being\n  of the Union.\u201d Baldwin, supra, at 388. Pp. 10\u201312.\n     2. Virginia\u2019s FOIA does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  The \u201ccommon thread\u201d among this Court\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause\n  cases is that \u201cthe State interfered with the natural functioning of the\n  interstate market either through prohibition or thorough burdensome\n  regulation.\u201d Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806.\n  Virginia\u2019s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits access to an interstate\n  market nor imposes burdensome regulation on that market. Accord-\n  ingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant Commerce Clause\n  case. Even shoehorned into the Court\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause\n  framework, however, Hurlbert\u2019s claim would fail. Insofar as there is\n  a \u201cmarket\u201d for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for a\n  product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the Com-\n  monwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not violate the\n  dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market through a\n  state program, it \u201climits benefits generated by [that] state program to\n  those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to\n  serve.\u201d Reeves, Inc. v.

Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700 et seq.,\nviolates either the Privileges and Immunities Clause of\nArticle IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce\nClause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\nprovides that \u201call public records shall be open to inspection\nand copying by any citizens of the Commonwealth,\u201d but\nit grants no such right to non-Virginians. \u00a72.2\u20133704(A)\n(Lexis 2011).\n   Petitioners, who are citizens of other States, unsuccess-\nfully sought information under the Act and then brought\nthis constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that\npetitioners\u2019 constitutional rights were not violated. By\nmeans other than the state FOIA, Virginia made available\nto petitioners most of the information that they sought,\nand the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to furnish the additional\ninformation did not abridge any constitutionally protected\nprivilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia violate the dor-\n2                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of Informa-\ntion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful\nsense, but instead provides a service that is related to\nstate citizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the deci-\nsion of the Court of Appeals rejecting petitioners\u2019 constitu-\ntional claims.\n                               I\n   Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W. Hurlbert\nare citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively.\nMcBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under\nthe Virginia FOIA, but their requests were denied because\nof their citizenship.\n   McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose ex-wife\nis a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her\nchild support obligations, McBurney asked the Common-\nwealth\u2019s Division of Child Support Enforcement to file a\npetition for child support on his behalf. The agency com-\nplied, but only after a 9-month delay. McBurney attrib-\nutes that delay to agency error and says that it cost him\nnine months of child support. To ascertain the reason for\nthe agency\u2019s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA re-\nquest seeking \u201call emails, notes, files, memos, reports,\nletters, policies, [and] opinions\u201d pertaining to his family,\nalong with all documents \u201cregarding [his] application for\nchild support\u201d and all documents pertaining to the han-\ndling of child support claims like his. App. in No. 11\u20131099\n(CA4), p. 39A. The agency denied McBurney\u2019s request on\nthe ground that he was not a Virginia citizen. McBurney\nlater requested the same documents under Virginia\u2019s Gov-\nernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act,\nVa. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133800 et seq., and through that re-\nquest he received most of the information he had sought\nthat pertained specifically to his own case. He did not,\nhowever, receive any general policy information about how\nthe agency handled claims like his.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a\nland/title company to obtain real estate tax records for\nproperties in Henrico County, Virginia. He filed a Virginia\nFOIA request for the documents with the Henrico County\nReal Estate Assessor\u2019s Office, but his request was denied\nbecause he was not a Virginia citizen.\n   Petitioners filed suit under 42 U.

See, e.g., Ala. Code \u00a736\u201312\u201340 (2012 Cum.\nSupp.); Ark. Code Ann. \u00a725\u201319\u2013105 (2011 Supp.); Del.\nCode Ann., Tit. 29, \u00a710003 (2012 Supp.); Mo. Rev.

New York Tax Appeals Tribunal,\n522 U. S. 287, 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have\ncautioned, that \u201cstate citizenship or residency may never\nbe used by a State to distinguish among persons.\u201d Bald-\nwin v. Fish and Game Comm\u2019n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371,\n383 (1978). \u201cNor must a State always apply all its laws or\nall its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident,\nwho may request it so to do.\u201d Ibid. Rather, we have long\nheld that the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects\nonly those privileges and immunities that are \u201cfundamen-\ntal.\u201d See, e.g., id., at 382, 388.\n  Petitioners allege that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision violates four different \u201cfundamental\u201d privileges\nor immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common call-\ning, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the\nVirginia courts, and access to public information. The first\nthree items on that list, however, are not abridged by the\nVirginia FOIA, and the fourth\u2014framed broadly\u2014is not\nprotected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n                              A\n   Hurlbert argues that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA pro-\nvision abridges his ability to earn a living in his chosen\nprofession, namely, obtaining property records from state\nand local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct\nthat the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the\nright of citizens to \u201cply their trade, practice their occupa-\ntion, or pursue a common calling.\u201d Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437\nU. S. 518, 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper, 470\nU. S. 274, 280 (1985) (\u201c \u2018[O]ne of the privileges which the\nClause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing\nbusiness in State B on terms of substantial equality with\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

But the Virginia FOIA does\nnot abridge Hulbert\u2019s ability to engage in a common call-\ning in the sense prohibited by the Privileges and Immuni-\nties Clause. Rather, the Court has struck laws down as\nviolating the privilege of pursuing a common calling only\nwhen those laws were enacted for the protectionist pur-\npose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g., Hicklin,\nsupra, (striking down as a violation of noncitizens\u2019 privi-\nleges and immunities an \u201cAlaska Hire\u201d statute containing\na resident hiring preference for all employment related to\nthe development of the State\u2019s oil and gas resources);\nToomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395, 397 (1948) (striking\ndown a South Carolina statute imposing a $2,500 license\nfee on out-of-state shrimping boats and only a $25 fee on\nin-state shrimping boats where petitioners alleged that\nthe \u201cpurpose and effect of this statute . . . [was] not to\nconserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby\ncreate a commercial monopoly for South Carolina resi-\ndents,\u201d and the \u201crecord cas[t] some doubt on\u201d the State\u2019s\ncounterassertion that the statute\u2019s \u201cobvious purpose was\nto conserve its shrimp supply\u201d); United Building & Constr.\nTrades Council of Camden Cty. v. Mayor and Council of\nCamden, 465 U. S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal\nordinance requiring that at least 40% of employees of\ncontractors and subcontractors working on city construc-\ntion projects be city residents facially burdened out-of-\nstate citizens\u2019 ability to pursue a common calling). In each\ncase, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to ad-\nvantage in-state workers and commercial interests at the\nexpense of their out-of-state counterparts.\n   Virginia\u2019s FOIA differs sharply from those statutes. By\nits own terms, Virginia\u2019s FOIA was enacted to \u201censur[e]\nthe people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies\nwherein the business of the people is being conducted.\u201d\n6                   MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nVa. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does\nnot allege\u2014and has offered no proof\u2014that the challenged\nprovision of the Virginia FOIA was enacted in order to\nprovide a competitive economic advantage for Virginia\ncitizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 67\n(2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute to\nfind economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that\nthe distinction that the statute makes between citizens\nand noncitizens has a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The\nstate FOIA essentially represents a mechanism by which\nthose who ultimately hold sovereign power (i.e., the citi-\nzens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an accounting\nfrom the public officials to whom they delegate the exer-\ncise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, \u00a72; Va. Code\nAnn. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the\nuse of the state FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that\nVirginia taxpayers foot the bill for the fixed costs underly-\ning recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n53\u201354. The challenged provision of the state FOIA does\nnot violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause simply\nbecause it has the incidental effect of preventing citizens\nof other States from making a profit by trading on in-\nformation contained in state records. While the Clause\nforbids a State from intentionally giving its own citizens a\ncompetitive advantage in business or employment, the\nClause does not require that a State tailor its every action\nto avoid any incidental effect on out-of-state tradesmen.\n                               B\n  Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged provision of\nthe Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and transfer\nproperty in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue\na common calling, the right to \u201ctake, hold and dispose of\nproperty, either real or personal,\u201d has long been seen as\none of the privileges of citizenship.

Neither at oral argu-\nment nor in its briefs did Virginia cite any Virginia statute providing\nthat real estate tax assessment records be filed in the clerk\u2019s office.\nVirginia Code Ann. \u00a758.1\u20133300 (Lexis 2009), which directs that \u201creas-\nsessment\u201d records be filed with the clerk, may be the statute to which\ncounsel referred, but without an official construction of the statute by\nVirginia\u2019s Supreme Court\u2014and, in light of the fact that petitioners\nhave not been afforded an opportunity to rebut its importance\u2014we do\nnot rely upon it here.\n  2 See http://www.co.henrico.va.us/finance/disclaimer.html (as visited\n\nApril 26, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Virginia FOIA slams the courthouse door on nonciti-\nzens; rather, the most they claim is that the law creates\n\u201c[a]n information asymmetry between adversaries based\nsolely on state citizenship.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 42.\n   The Privileges and Immunities Clause does not require\nStates to erase any distinction between citizens and non-\ncitizens that might conceivably give state citizens some\ndetectable litigation advantage. Rather, the Court has\nmade clear that \u201cthe constitutional requirement is sat-\nisfied if the non-resident is given access to the courts of\nthe State upon terms which in themselves are reasonable\nand adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have,\neven though they may not be technically and precisely the\nsame in extent as those accorded to resident citizens.\u201d\nCanadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen, 252 U. S. 553, 562\n(1920).\n   The challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA clearly\ndoes not deprive noncitizens of \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d\naccess to the Commonwealth\u2019s courts. Virginia\u2019s rules of\ncivil procedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct.\nRule 4:1 (2012), and subpoenas duces tecum, Rule 4:9.\nThere is no reason to think that those mechanisms are\ninsufficient to provide noncitizens with any relevant,\nnonprivileged documents needed in litigation.\n   Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and noncitizens\nalike access to judicial records. Va. Code Ann. \u00a717.1\u2013208;\nsee also Shenandoah Publishing House, Inc. v. Fanning,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258, 368 S. E. 2d 253, 256 (1988). And if\nVirginia has in its possession information about any per-\nson, whether a citizen of the Commonwealth or of another\nState, that person has the right under the Government\nData Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to in-\nspect that information. \u00a72.2\u20133806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011).\n   McBurney\u2019s own case is illustrative. When his FOIA\nrequest was denied, McBurney was told that he should\nrequest the materials he sought pursuant to the Govern-\n10                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act.\nUpon placing a request under that Act, he ultimately\nreceived much of what he sought. Accordingly, Virginia\u2019s\ncitizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly bur-\nden noncitizens\u2019 ability to access the Commonwealth\u2019s\ncourts.\n                              D\n   Finally, we reject petitioners\u2019 sweeping claim that the\nchallenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them\nthe right to access public information on equal terms with\ncitizens of the Commonwealth. We cannot agree that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause covers this broad right.\n   This Court has repeatedly made clear that there is no\nconstitutional right to obtain all the information provided\nby FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1,\n14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (\u201c \u2018The Constitution itself is\n[not] a Freedom of Information Act\u2019 \u201d); see also Los Angeles\nPolice Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp., 528\nU. S. 32, 40 (1999) (the Government could decide \u201cnot to\ngive out [this] information at all\u201d); Sorrell v. IMS Health\nInc., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip\nop., at 8) (\u201c[T]his Court has never found that the First\nAmendment prohibits the government from restricting the\nuse of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory\nmandate\u201d).\n   It certainly cannot be said that such a broad right has\n\u201cat all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several\nstates which compose this Union, from the time of their\nbecoming free, independent, and sovereign.\u201d Corfield, 6\nF. Cas., at 551. No such right was recognized at common\nlaw. See H.

Most founding-era English cases\nprovided that only those persons who had a personal\ninterest in non-judicial records were permitted to access\nthem. See, e.g., King v. Shelley, 3 T.

(\u201c[O]ne man has no\nright to look into another\u2019s title deeds and records, when\nhe . . . has no interest in the deeds or rolls himself \u201d); King\nv. Justices of Staffordshire, 6 Ad. & E. 84, 101, 112 Eng.\nRep. 33, 39 (K. B. 1837) (\u201cThe utmost . . . that can be said\non the ground of interest, is that the applicants have a\nrational curiosity to gratify by this inspection, or that they\nmay thereby ascertain facts useful to them in advancing\nsome ulterior measures in contemplation as to regulating\ncounty expenditure; but this is merely an interest in ob-\ntaining information on the general subject, and would\nfurnish an equally good reason for permitting inspection of\nthe records of any other county: there is not that direct\nand tangible interest, which is necessary to bring them\nwithin the rule on which the Court acts in granting in-\nspection of public documents\u201d).\n  Nineteenth-century American cases, while less uniform,\ncertainly do not support the proposition that a broad-\nbased right to access public information was widely recog-\nnized in the early Republic.

Acts ch.\n479, p. 690. There is no contention that the Nation\u2019s unity\nfoundered in their absence, or that it is suffering now\nbecause of the citizens-only FOIA provisions that several\nStates have enacted.\n                             III\n   In addition to his Privileges and Immunities Clause\nclaim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia\u2019s citizens-only\nFOIA provision violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\nThe Commerce Clause empowers Congress \u201c[t]o regulate\nCommerce . . . among the several States.\u201d Art.

J.)\n(dictum).\n   Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence \u201csignifi-\ncantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate\nor otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.\u201d\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151 (1986). It is driven by\na concern about \u201ceconomic protectionism\u2014that is, regula-\ntory measures designed to benefit in-state economic inter-\nests by burdening out-of-state competitors.\u201d New Energy\nCo. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273\u2013274 (1988); see\nalso Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)\n(\u201cThe crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determining\nwhether [the challenged statute] is basically a protection-\nist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law\ndirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon\ninterstate commerce that are only incidental\u201d).\n   Virginia\u2019s FOIA law neither \u201cregulates\u201d nor \u201cburdens\u201d\ninterstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service\nto local citizens that would not otherwise be available at\nall. The \u201ccommon thread\u201d among those cases in which the\nCourt has found a dormant Commerce Clause violation\nis that \u201cthe State interfered with the natural functioning\nof the interstate market either through prohibition or\nthrough burdensome regulation.\u201d Hughes v. Alexandria\nScrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806 (1976). Here, by contrast,\nVirginia neither prohibits access to an interstate market\nnor imposes burdensome regulation on that market.\nRather, it merely creates and provides to its own citizens\ncopies\u2014which would not otherwise exist\u2014of state records.\nAs discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia\u2019s\nFOIA law is to \u201censur[e] the people of the Commonwealth\nready access to public records in the custody of a public\n14                  MCBURNEY v. YOUNG\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbody or its officers and employees, and free entry to meet-\nings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is\nbeing conducted.\u201d Va. Code Ann. \u00a72.2\u20133700(B). This case\nis thus most properly brought under the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause: It quite literally poses the question\nwhether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit\nthat it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf. Missouri\nPacific R. Co., 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the\nprivilege of access to a State\u2019s courts must be made avail-\nable to out-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the\nrelevant State). Because it does not pose the question of\nthe constitutionality of a state law that interferes with an\ninterstate market through prohibition or burdensome\nregulations, this case is not governed by the dormant\nCommerce Clause.\n   Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause\nframework, however, Hurlbert\u2019s claim would fail. Insofar\nas there is a \u201cmarket\u201d for public documents in Virginia, it\nis a market for a product that the Commonwealth has\ncreated and of which the Commonwealth is the sole manu-\nfacturer. We have held that a State does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause when, having created a mar-\nket through a state program, it \u201climits benefits generated\nby [that] state program to those who fund the state treas-\nury and whom the State was created to serve.\u201d Reeves,\nInc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 442 (1980). \u201cSuch policies,\nwhile perhaps \u2018protectionist\u2019 in a loose sense, reflect the\nessential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state\ngovernment\u2014to serve the citizens of the State.\u201d Ibid.; cf.\nDepartment of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U. S. 328,\n341 (2008) (\u201c[A] government function is not susceptible to\nstandard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its\nlikely motivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the\nsimple economic protectionism the Clause abhors\u201d). For\nthese reasons, Virginia\u2019s citizens-only FOIA provision does\nnot violate the dormant Commerce Clause.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
