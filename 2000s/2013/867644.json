A.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11–1518. Argued March 18, 2013 —Decided May 13, 2013\nPetitioner’s father established a trust for the benefit of petitioner and\n  his siblings, and made petitioner the (nonprofessional) trustee. The\n  trust’s sole asset was the father’s life insurance policy. Petitioner\n  borrowed funds from the trust three times; all borrowed funds were\n  repaid with interest. His siblings obtained a judgment against him\n  in state court for breach of fiduciary duty, though the court found no\n  apparent malicious motive. The court imposed constructive trusts on\n  certain of petitioner’s interests—including his interest in the original\n  trust—in order to secure petitioner’s payment of the judgment, with\n  respondent serving as trustee for all of the trusts. Petitioner filed for\n  bankruptcy. Respondent opposed discharge of petitioner’s state-\n  court-imposed debts to the trust, and the Bankruptcy Court granted\n  respondent summary judgment, holding that petitioner’s debts were\n  not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(4), which provides\n  that an individual cannot obtain a bankruptcy discharge from a debt\n  “for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embez-\n  zlement, or larceny.” The Federal District Court and the Eleventh\n  Circuit affirmed. The latter court reasoned that “defalcation requires\n  a known breach of fiduciary duty, such that the conduct can be char-\n  acterized as objectively reckless.”\nHeld: The term “defalcation” in the Bankruptcy Code includes a culpa-\n ble state of mind requirement involving knowledge of, or gross reck-\n lessness in respect to, the improper nature of the fiduciary behavior.\n Pp. 4−9.\n    (a) While “defalcation” has been an exception to discharge in a\n bankruptcy statute since 1867, legal authorities have long disagreed\n about its meaning. Broad definitions of the term in modern and older\n dictionaries are unhelpful, and courts of appeals have disagreed\n2                 BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    about what mental state must accompany defalcation’s definition.\n    Pp. 4−5.\n       (b) In Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, this Court interpreted the term\n    “fraud” in the Bankruptcy Code’s exceptions to discharge to mean\n    “positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or inten-\n    tional wrong, as does embezzlement; and not implied fraud, or fraud\n    in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immo-\n    rality.” Id., at 709. The term “defalcation” should be treated similar-\n    ly. Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad faith, mor-\n    al turpitude, or other immoral conduct, “defalcation” requires an\n    intentional wrong. An intentional wrong includes not only conduct\n    that the fiduciary knows is improper but also reckless conduct of the\n    kind that the criminal law often treats as the equivalent. Where ac-\n    tual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, conduct is considered as\n    equivalent if, as set forth in the Model Penal Code, the fiduciary “con-\n    sciously disregards,” or is willfully blind to, “a substantial and unjusti-\n    fiable risk” that his conduct will violate a fiduciary duty. Pp. 5−7.\n       (c) Several considerations support this interpretation. First, statu-\n    tory context strongly favors it. The canon noscitur a sociis argues for\n    interpreting “defalcation” as similar to its linguistic neighbors “em-\n    bezzlement,” “larceny,” and “fraud,” which all require a showing of\n    wrongful or felonious intent. See, e.g., Neal, supra, at 709. Second,\n    the interpretation does not make the word identical to its statutory\n    neighbors. “Embezzlement” requires conversion, “larceny” requires\n    taking and carrying away another’s property, and “fraud” typically\n    requires a false statement or omission; while “defalcation” can en-\n    compass a breach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conver-\n    sion, nor taking and carrying away another’s property, nor falsity.\n    Third, the interpretation is consistent with the longstanding princi-\n    ple that “exceptions to discharge ‘should be confined to those plainly\n    expressed.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62. It is also con-\n    sistent with statutory exceptions to discharge that Congress normally\n    confines to circumstances where strong, special policy considerations,\n    such as the presence of fault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby\n    benefiting, for example, a typically more honest creditor. See, e.g., 11\n    U. S. C. §523(a)(2)(A). Fourth, some Circuits have interpreted the\n    statute similarly for many years without administrative or other dif-\n    ficulties. Finally, it is important to have a uniform interpretation of\n    federal law, the choices are limited, and neither the parties nor the\n    Government has presented strong considerations favoring a different\n    interpretation.

S. C. §523(a)(4). We here consider the scope of the term\n“defalcation.” We hold that it includes a culpable state of\nmind requirement akin to that which accompanies appli-\ncation of the other terms in the same statutory phrase.\nWe describe that state of mind as one involving knowledge\nof, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature\nof the relevant fiduciary behavior.\n                               I\n   In 1978, the father of petitioner Randy Bullock estab-\nlished a trust for the benefit of his five children. He made\npetitioner the (nonprofessional) trustee; and he trans-\nferred to the trust a single asset, an insurance policy on\nhis life. 670 F. 3d 1160, 1162 (CA11 2012); App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 33a. The trust instrument permitted the trustee\nto borrow funds from the insurer against the policy’s\nvalue (which, in practice, was available at an insurance-\n2            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N.

Id., at 17a, 34a,\n50a.\n   In 1981, petitioner, at his father’s request, borrowed\nmoney from the trust, paying the funds to his mother who\nused them to repay a debt to the father’s business. In\n1984, petitioner again borrowed funds from the trust, this\ntime using the funds to pay for certificates of deposit,\nwhich he and his mother used to buy a mill. In 1990,\npetitioner once again borrowed funds, this time using the\nmoney to buy real property for himself and his mother.\n670 F. 3d, at 1162. Petitioner saw that all of the borrowed\nfunds were repaid to the trust along with 6% interest.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 17a, 45a, 50a; Brief for Petitioner 3;\nBrief for Respondent 2.\n   In 1999, petitioner’s brothers sued petitioner in Illinois\nstate court. The state court held that petitioner had com-\nmitted a breach of fiduciary duty. It explained that peti-\ntioner “does not appear to have had a malicious motive in\nborrowing funds from the trust” but nonetheless “was\nclearly involved in self-dealing.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a,\n52a. It ordered petitioner to pay the trust “the benefits he\nreceived from his breaches” (along with costs and attor-\nney’s fees). Id., at 47a. The court imposed constructive\ntrusts on petitioner’s interests in the mill and the original\ntrust, in order to secure petitioner’s payment of its judg-\nment, with respondent BankChampaign serving as trustee\nfor all of the trusts. 670 F. 3d, at 1162; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a–48a. After petitioner tried unsuccessfully to\nliquidate his interests in the mill and other constructive\ntrust assets to obtain funds to make the court-ordered\npayment, petitioner filed for bankruptcy in federal court.\nId., at 27a, 30a.\n   BankChampaign opposed petitioner’s efforts to obtain a\nbankruptcy discharge of his state-court-imposed debts to\nthe trust. And the Bankruptcy Court granted summary\njudgment in the bank’s favor. It held that the debts fell\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Hence,\nthey were not dischargeable.\n   The Federal District Court reviewed the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s determination. It said that it was “convinced” that\nBankChampaign was “abusing its position of trust by fail-\ning to liquidate the assets,” but it nonetheless affirmed the\nBankruptcy Court’s decision. Id., at 27a–28a.\n   In turn, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District\nCourt. It wrote that “defalcation requires a known breach\nof a fiduciary duty, such that the conduct can be character-\nized as objectively reckless.” 670 F. 3d, at 1166. And it\nfound that petitioner’s conduct satisfied this standard.\nIbid.\n\n   Petitioner sought certiorari. In effect he has asked us\nto decide whether the bankruptcy term “defalcation” applies\n“in the absence of any specific finding of ill intent or evi-\ndence of an ultimate loss of trust principal.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 1. See also Pet. for Cert.\ni. The lower courts have long disagreed about whether\n“defalcation” includes a scienter requirement and, if so,\nwhat kind of scienter it requires. Compare In re Sherman,\n658 F. 3d 1009, 1017 (CA9 2011) (“defalcation” includes\n“even innocent acts of failure to fully account for money\nreceived in trust” (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)), with In re Uwimana, 274 F. 3d 806, 811 (CA4\n2001) (defalcation occurs when “negligence or even an in-\nnocent mistake . . . results in misappropriation”), with 670\nF. 3d, at 1166 (“defalcation requires . . . conduct [that] can\nbe characterized as objectively reckless”), and with In re\nBaylis, 313 F. 3d 9, 20 (CA1 2002) (“defalcation requires\nsomething close to a showing of extreme recklessness”). In\nlight of that disagreement, we granted the petition.\n4            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress first included the term “defalcation” as an\nexception to discharge in a federal bankruptcy statute in\n1867. See id., at 17. And legal authorities have disagreed\nabout its meaning almost ever since. Dictionary defini-\ntions of “defalcation” are not particularly helpful. On the\none hand, a law dictionary in use in 1867 defines the word\n“defalcation” as “the act of a defaulter,” which, in turn, it\ndefines broadly as one “who is deficient in his accounts, or\nfails in making his accounts correct.” 1 J. Bouvier, Law\nDictionary 387, 388 (4th ed. 1852). See also 4 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 369 (2d ed. 1989) (quoting an 1846\ndefinition that defines the term as “ ‘a breach of trust by\none who has charge or management of money’ ”). Modern\ndictionaries contain similarly broad definitional language.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, for example, defines “defalcation”\nfirst as “EMBEZZLEMENT,” but, second, as “[l]oosely, the\nfailure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent default.”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nBlack’s). See also American Heritage Dictionary 474 (5th\ned. 2011) (“To misuse funds; embezzle”); 4 Oxford English\nDictionary, supra, at 369 (“monetary deficiency through\nbreach of trust by one who has the management or charge\nof funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters”);\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 686 (2d ed. 1954)\n(“An abstraction or misappropriation of money by one, esp.\nan officer or agent, having it in trust”); Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 590 (1986) (“misappropria-\ntion of money in one’s keeping”).\n   On the other hand, an 1842 bankruptcy treatise warns\nthat fiduciaries “are not supposed to commit defalcation in\nthe matter of their trust, without . . . at least such crimi-\nnal negligence as admits of no excuse.” G. Bicknell, Com-\nmentary on the Bankrupt Law of 1841, Showing Its\nOperation and Effect 12 (2d ed. 1842). Modern dictionaries\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

And the editor of Black’s Law\nDictionary has written that the term should be read as\nlimited to deficiencies that are “fraudulent” and which are\n“the fault of someone put in trust of the money.” B. Gar-\nner, Modern American Usage 232 (3d ed. 2009) (emphasis\nadded).\n   Similarly, courts of appeals have long disagreed about\nthe mental state that must accompany the bankruptcy-\nrelated definition of “defalcation.” Many years ago Judge\nAugustus Hand wrote that “the misappropriation must be\ndue to a known breach of the duty, and not to mere negli-\ngence or mistake.” In re Bernard, 87 F. 2d 705, 707 (CA2\n1937). But Judge Learned Hand suggested that the term\n“may have included innocent defaults.” Central Hanover\nBank & Trust Co. v. Herbst, 93 F. 2d 510, 511 (CA2 1937)\n(emphasis added). A more modern treatise on trusts ends\nits discussion of the subject with a question mark. 4 A.\nScott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on\nTrusts §24.26 p. 1797 (5th ed. 2007).\n   In resolving these differences, we note that this long-\nstanding disagreement concerns state of mind, not whether\n“defalcation” can cover a trustee’s failure (as here) to make\na trust more than whole. We consequently shall assume\nwithout deciding that the statutory term is broad enough\nto cover the latter type of conduct and answer only the\n“state of mind” question.\n                            B\n                            1\n  We base our approach and our answer upon one of this\nCourt’s precedents. In 1878, this Court interpreted the\nrelated statutory term “fraud” in the portion of the Bank-\nruptcy Code laying out exceptions to discharge. Justice\n6            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHarlan wrote for the Court:\n    “[D]ebts created by ‘fraud’ are associated directly with\n    debts created by ‘embezzlement.’ Such association\n    justifies, if it does not imperatively require, the con-\n    clusion that the ‘fraud’ referred to in that section\n    means positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral\n    turpitude or intentional wrong, as does embezzlement;\n    and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may ex-\n    ist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.”\n    Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 709 (1878).\nWe believe that the statutory term “defalcation” should be\ntreated similarly.\n  Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad\nfaith, moral turpitude, or other immoral conduct, the term\nrequires an intentional wrong. We include as intentional\nnot only conduct that the fiduciary knows is improper\nbut also reckless conduct of the kind that the criminal\nlaw often treats as the equivalent. Thus, we include reck-\nless conduct of the kind set forth in the Model Penal\nCode. Where actual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, we\nconsider conduct as equivalent if the fiduciary “consciously\ndisregards” (or is willfully blind to) “a substantial and\nunjustifiable risk” that his conduct will turn out to violate\na fiduciary duty. ALI, Model Penal Code §2.02(2)(c), p.\n226 (1985). See id., §2.02 Comment 9, at 248 (explaining\nthat the Model Penal Code’s definition of “knowledge” was\ndesigned to include “ ‘wilful blindness’ ”). That risk “must\nbe of such a nature and degree that, considering the\nnature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the cir-\ncumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross\ndeviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding\nperson would observe in the actor’s situation.”           Id.,\n§2.02(2)(c), at 226 (emphasis added). Cf. Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976) (defining\nscienter for securities law purposes as “a mental state\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nembracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”).\n                              2\n   Several considerations lead us to interpret the statutory\nterm “defalcation” in this way. First, as Justice Harlan\npointed out in Neal, statutory context strongly favors this\ninterpretation.     Applying the canon of interpretation\nnoscitur a sociis, the Court there looked to fraud’s linguis-\ntic neighbor, “embezzlement.” It found that both terms\nrefer to different forms of generally similar conduct. It\nwrote that both are “ ‘ejusdem generis,’ ” of the same kind,\nand that both are “ ‘referable to the same subject-matter.’ ”\n95 U. S., at 709. Moreover, embezzlement requires a\nshowing of wrongful intent. Ibid. (noting that embezzle-\nment “involv[es] moral turpitude or intentional wrong”).\nSee Moore v. United States, 160 U. S. 268, 269–270 (1895)\n(describing embezzlement and larceny as requiring “felo-\nnious intent”). See also, e.g., W. LaFave, Criminal Law\n§19.6(a), p. 995 (5th ed. 2010) (“intent to deprive” is part of\nembezzlement). Hence, the Court concluded, “fraud” must\nrequire an equivalent showing. Neal, supra, at 709. Neal\nhas been the law for more than a century. And here, the\nadditional neighbors (“larceny” and, as defined in Neal,\n“fraud”) mean that the canon noscitur a sociis argues even\nmore strongly for similarly interpreting the similar statu-\ntory term “defalcation.”\n   Second, this interpretation does not make the word\nidentical to its statutory neighbors. See Babbitt v. Sweet\nHome Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S.\n687, 698 (1995) (noting “[a] reluctance to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage”). As commonly used, “embezzlement”\nrequires conversion, and “larceny” requires taking and\ncarrying away another’s property. See LaFave, Criminal\nLaw §§19.2, 19.5 (larceny); id., §19.6 (embezzlement).\n“Fraud” typically requires a false statement or omission.\nSee id., §19.7 (discussing fraud in the context of false\n8            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npretenses). “Defalcation,” as commonly used (hence as\nCongress might have understood it), can encompass a\nbreach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conver-\nsion, nor taking and carrying away another’s property, nor\nfalsity. Black’s 479. See, e.g., In re Frankel, 77 B. R. 401\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WDNY 1987) (finding a breach of fiduciary\nduty and defalcation based on an unreasonable sale of\nassets).\n  Nor are embezzlement, larceny, and fiduciary fraud\nsimply special cases of defalcation as so defined. The\nstatutory provision makes clear that the first two terms\napply outside of the fiduciary context; and “defalcation,”\nunlike “fraud,” may be used to refer to nonfraudulent\nbreaches of fiduciary duty. Black’s 479.\n  Third, the interpretation is consistent with the long-\nstanding principle that “exceptions to discharge ‘should\nbe confined to those plainly expressed.’ ” Kawaauhau v.\nGeiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (quoting Gleason v.\nThaw, 236 U. S. 558, 562 (1915)). See Local Loan Co.\nv. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 244 (1934); Neal, supra, at 709. It\nis also consistent with a set of statutory exceptions that\nCongress normally confines to circumstances where strong,\nspecial policy considerations, such as the presence of\nfault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby benefiting,\nfor example, a typically more honest creditor. See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. §§523(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), (a)(6), (a)(9) (fault). See\nalso, e.g., §§523(a)(1), (a)(7), (a)(14), (a)(14A) (taxes);\n§523(a)(8) (educational loans); §523(a)(15) (spousal and\nchild support). In the absence of fault, it is difficult to find\nstrong policy reasons favoring a broader exception here, at\nleast in respect to those whom a scienter requirement will\nmost likely help, namely nonprofessional trustees, perhaps\nadministering small family trusts potentially immersed in\nintrafamily arguments that are difficult to evaluate in\nterms of comparative fault.\n  Fourth, as far as the briefs before us reveal, at least\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsome Circuits have interpreted the statute similarly for\nmany years without administrative, or other practical,\ndifficulties. Baylis, 313 F. 3d 9.

In\naddition to those we have already discussed, the Govern-\nment has pointed to the fact that in 1970 Congress\nrewrote the statute, eliminating the word “misappropria-\ntion” and placing the term “defalcation” (previously in a\ndifferent exemption provision) alongside its present three\nneighbors. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16–17. The Government believes that these changes\nsupport reading “defalcation” without a scienter require-\nment. But one might argue, with equal plausibility, that\nthe changes reflect a decision to make certain that courts\nwould read in similar ways “defalcation,” “fraud,” “embez-\nzlement,” and “larceny.” In fact, we believe the 1970\nchanges are inconclusive.\n                              III\n  In this case the Court of Appeals applied a standard of\n“objectiv[e] reckless[ness]” to facts presented at summary\njudgment. 670 F. 3d, at 1166. We consequently remand\nthe case to permit the court to determine whether further\nproceedings are needed and, if so, to apply the heightened\nstandard that we have set forth.

Argued March 18, 2013 —Decided May 13, 2013\nPetitioner’s father established a trust for the benefit of petitioner and\n  his siblings, and made petitioner the (nonprofessional) trustee. The\n  trust’s sole asset was the father’s life insurance policy. Petitioner\n  borrowed funds from the trust three times; all borrowed funds were\n  repaid with interest. His siblings obtained a judgment against him\n  in state court for breach of fiduciary duty, though the court found no\n  apparent malicious motive. The court imposed constructive trusts on\n  certain of petitioner’s interests—including his interest in the original\n  trust—in order to secure petitioner’s payment of the judgment, with\n  respondent serving as trustee for all of the trusts. Petitioner filed for\n  bankruptcy. Respondent opposed discharge of petitioner’s state-\n  court-imposed debts to the trust, and the Bankruptcy Court granted\n  respondent summary judgment, holding that petitioner’s debts were\n  not dischargeable pursuant to 11 U. S. C. §523(a)(4), which provides\n  that an individual cannot obtain a bankruptcy discharge from a debt\n  “for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embez-\n  zlement, or larceny.” The Federal District Court and the Eleventh\n  Circuit affirmed. The latter court reasoned that “defalcation requires\n  a known breach of fiduciary duty, such that the conduct can be char-\n  acterized as objectively reckless.”\nHeld: The term “defalcation” in the Bankruptcy Code includes a culpa-\n ble state of mind requirement involving knowledge of, or gross reck-\n lessness in respect to, the improper nature of the fiduciary behavior.\n Pp. 4−9.\n    (a) While “defalcation” has been an exception to discharge in a\n bankruptcy statute since 1867, legal authorities have long disagreed\n about its meaning. Broad definitions of the term in modern and older\n dictionaries are unhelpful, and courts of appeals have disagreed\n2                 BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    about what mental state must accompany defalcation’s definition.\n    Pp. 4−5.\n       (b) In Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, this Court interpreted the term\n    “fraud” in the Bankruptcy Code’s exceptions to discharge to mean\n    “positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral turpitude or inten-\n    tional wrong, as does embezzlement; and not implied fraud, or fraud\n    in law, which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immo-\n    rality.” Id., at 709. The term “defalcation” should be treated similar-\n    ly. Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad faith, mor-\n    al turpitude, or other immoral conduct, “defalcation” requires an\n    intentional wrong. An intentional wrong includes not only conduct\n    that the fiduciary knows is improper but also reckless conduct of the\n    kind that the criminal law often treats as the equivalent. Where ac-\n    tual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, conduct is considered as\n    equivalent if, as set forth in the Model Penal Code, the fiduciary “con-\n    sciously disregards,” or is willfully blind to, “a substantial and unjusti-\n    fiable risk” that his conduct will violate a fiduciary duty. Pp. 5−7.\n       (c) Several considerations support this interpretation. First, statu-\n    tory context strongly favors it. The canon noscitur a sociis argues for\n    interpreting “defalcation” as similar to its linguistic neighbors “em-\n    bezzlement,” “larceny,” and “fraud,” which all require a showing of\n    wrongful or felonious intent. See, e.g., Neal, supra, at 709. Second,\n    the interpretation does not make the word identical to its statutory\n    neighbors. “Embezzlement” requires conversion, “larceny” requires\n    taking and carrying away another’s property, and “fraud” typically\n    requires a false statement or omission; while “defalcation” can en-\n    compass a breach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conver-\n    sion, nor taking and carrying away another’s property, nor falsity.\n    Third, the interpretation is consistent with the longstanding princi-\n    ple that “exceptions to discharge ‘should be confined to those plainly\n    expressed.’ ” Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62. It is also con-\n    sistent with statutory exceptions to discharge that Congress normally\n    confines to circumstances where strong, special policy considerations,\n    such as the presence of fault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby\n    benefiting, for example, a typically more honest creditor. See, e.g., 11\n    U. S. C. §523(a)(2)(A). Fourth, some Circuits have interpreted the\n    statute similarly for many years without administrative or other dif-\n    ficulties. Finally, it is important to have a uniform interpretation of\n    federal law, the choices are limited, and neither the parties nor the\n    Government has presented strong considerations favoring a different\n    interpretation.

S. C. §523(a)(4). We here consider the scope of the term\n“defalcation.” We hold that it includes a culpable state of\nmind requirement akin to that which accompanies appli-\ncation of the other terms in the same statutory phrase.\nWe describe that state of mind as one involving knowledge\nof, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature\nof the relevant fiduciary behavior.\n                               I\n   In 1978, the father of petitioner Randy Bullock estab-\nlished a trust for the benefit of his five children. He made\npetitioner the (nonprofessional) trustee; and he trans-\nferred to the trust a single asset, an insurance policy on\nhis life. 670 F. 3d 1160, 1162 (CA11 2012); App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 33a. The trust instrument permitted the trustee\nto borrow funds from the insurer against the policy’s\nvalue (which, in practice, was available at an insurance-\n2            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N.

Id., at 17a, 34a,\n50a.\n   In 1981, petitioner, at his father’s request, borrowed\nmoney from the trust, paying the funds to his mother who\nused them to repay a debt to the father’s business. In\n1984, petitioner again borrowed funds from the trust, this\ntime using the funds to pay for certificates of deposit,\nwhich he and his mother used to buy a mill. In 1990,\npetitioner once again borrowed funds, this time using the\nmoney to buy real property for himself and his mother.\n670 F. 3d, at 1162. Petitioner saw that all of the borrowed\nfunds were repaid to the trust along with 6% interest.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 17a, 45a, 50a; Brief for Petitioner 3;\nBrief for Respondent 2.\n   In 1999, petitioner’s brothers sued petitioner in Illinois\nstate court. The state court held that petitioner had com-\nmitted a breach of fiduciary duty. It explained that peti-\ntioner “does not appear to have had a malicious motive in\nborrowing funds from the trust” but nonetheless “was\nclearly involved in self-dealing.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a,\n52a. It ordered petitioner to pay the trust “the benefits he\nreceived from his breaches” (along with costs and attor-\nney’s fees). Id., at 47a. The court imposed constructive\ntrusts on petitioner’s interests in the mill and the original\ntrust, in order to secure petitioner’s payment of its judg-\nment, with respondent BankChampaign serving as trustee\nfor all of the trusts. 670 F. 3d, at 1162; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 47a–48a. After petitioner tried unsuccessfully to\nliquidate his interests in the mill and other constructive\ntrust assets to obtain funds to make the court-ordered\npayment, petitioner filed for bankruptcy in federal court.\nId., at 27a, 30a.\n   BankChampaign opposed petitioner’s efforts to obtain a\nbankruptcy discharge of his state-court-imposed debts to\nthe trust.

Hence,\nthey were not dischargeable.\n   The Federal District Court reviewed the Bankruptcy\nCourt’s determination. It said that it was “convinced” that\nBankChampaign was “abusing its position of trust by fail-\ning to liquidate the assets,” but it nonetheless affirmed the\nBankruptcy Court’s decision. Id., at 27a–28a.\n   In turn, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District\nCourt. It wrote that “defalcation requires a known breach\nof a fiduciary duty, such that the conduct can be character-\nized as objectively reckless.” 670 F. 3d, at 1166. And it\nfound that petitioner’s conduct satisfied this standard.\nIbid.\n\n   Petitioner sought certiorari. In effect he has asked us\nto decide whether the bankruptcy term “defalcation” applies\n“in the absence of any specific finding of ill intent or evi-\ndence of an ultimate loss of trust principal.” Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 1. See also Pet. for Cert.\ni. The lower courts have long disagreed about whether\n“defalcation” includes a scienter requirement and, if so,\nwhat kind of scienter it requires. Compare In re Sherman,\n658 F. 3d 1009, 1017 (CA9 2011) (“defalcation” includes\n“even innocent acts of failure to fully account for money\nreceived in trust” (internal quotation marks and brackets\nomitted)), with In re Uwimana, 274 F. 3d 806, 811 (CA4\n2001) (defalcation occurs when “negligence or even an in-\nnocent mistake . . . results in misappropriation”), with 670\nF. 3d, at 1166 (“defalcation requires . . . conduct [that] can\nbe characterized as objectively reckless”), and with In re\nBaylis, 313 F. 3d 9, 20 (CA1 2002) (“defalcation requires\nsomething close to a showing of extreme recklessness”). In\nlight of that disagreement, we granted the petition.\n4            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress first included the term “defalcation” as an\nexception to discharge in a federal bankruptcy statute in\n1867. See id., at 17. And legal authorities have disagreed\nabout its meaning almost ever since. Dictionary defini-\ntions of “defalcation” are not particularly helpful. On the\none hand, a law dictionary in use in 1867 defines the word\n“defalcation” as “the act of a defaulter,” which, in turn, it\ndefines broadly as one “who is deficient in his accounts, or\nfails in making his accounts correct.” 1 J. Bouvier, Law\nDictionary 387, 388 (4th ed. 1852). See also 4 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 369 (2d ed. 1989) (quoting an 1846\ndefinition that defines the term as “ ‘a breach of trust by\none who has charge or management of money’ ”). Modern\ndictionaries contain similarly broad definitional language.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, for example, defines “defalcation”\nfirst as “EMBEZZLEMENT,” but, second, as “[l]oosely, the\nfailure to meet an obligation; a nonfraudulent default.”\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 479 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter\nBlack’s). See also American Heritage Dictionary 474 (5th\ned. 2011) (“To misuse funds; embezzle”); 4 Oxford English\nDictionary, supra, at 369 (“monetary deficiency through\nbreach of trust by one who has the management or charge\nof funds; a fraudulent deficiency in money matters”);\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 686 (2d ed. 1954)\n(“An abstraction or misappropriation of money by one, esp.\nan officer or agent, having it in trust”); Webster’s Third\nNew International Dictionary 590 (1986) (“misappropria-\ntion of money in one’s keeping”).\n   On the other hand, an 1842 bankruptcy treatise warns\nthat fiduciaries “are not supposed to commit defalcation in\nthe matter of their trust, without . . . at least such crimi-\nnal negligence as admits of no excuse.” G. Bicknell, Com-\nmentary on the Bankrupt Law of 1841, Showing Its\nOperation and Effect 12 (2d ed. 1842). Modern dictionaries\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

And the editor of Black’s Law\nDictionary has written that the term should be read as\nlimited to deficiencies that are “fraudulent” and which are\n“the fault of someone put in trust of the money.” B. Gar-\nner, Modern American Usage 232 (3d ed. 2009) (emphasis\nadded).\n   Similarly, courts of appeals have long disagreed about\nthe mental state that must accompany the bankruptcy-\nrelated definition of “defalcation.” Many years ago Judge\nAugustus Hand wrote that “the misappropriation must be\ndue to a known breach of the duty, and not to mere negli-\ngence or mistake.” In re Bernard, 87 F. 2d 705, 707 (CA2\n1937). But Judge Learned Hand suggested that the term\n“may have included innocent defaults.” Central Hanover\nBank & Trust Co. v. Herbst, 93 F. 2d 510, 511 (CA2 1937)\n(emphasis added). A more modern treatise on trusts ends\nits discussion of the subject with a question mark. 4 A.\nScott, W. Fratcher, & M. Ascher, Scott and Ascher on\nTrusts §24.26 p. 1797 (5th ed. 2007).\n   In resolving these differences, we note that this long-\nstanding disagreement concerns state of mind, not whether\n“defalcation” can cover a trustee’s failure (as here) to make\na trust more than whole. We consequently shall assume\nwithout deciding that the statutory term is broad enough\nto cover the latter type of conduct and answer only the\n“state of mind” question.\n                            B\n                            1\n  We base our approach and our answer upon one of this\nCourt’s precedents. In 1878, this Court interpreted the\nrelated statutory term “fraud” in the portion of the Bank-\nruptcy Code laying out exceptions to discharge. Justice\n6            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nHarlan wrote for the Court:\n    “[D]ebts created by ‘fraud’ are associated directly with\n    debts created by ‘embezzlement.’ Such association\n    justifies, if it does not imperatively require, the con-\n    clusion that the ‘fraud’ referred to in that section\n    means positive fraud, or fraud in fact, involving moral\n    turpitude or intentional wrong, as does embezzlement;\n    and not implied fraud, or fraud in law, which may ex-\n    ist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.”\n    Neal v. Clark, 95 U. S. 704, 709 (1878).\nWe believe that the statutory term “defalcation” should be\ntreated similarly.\n  Thus, where the conduct at issue does not involve bad\nfaith, moral turpitude, or other immoral conduct, the term\nrequires an intentional wrong. We include as intentional\nnot only conduct that the fiduciary knows is improper\nbut also reckless conduct of the kind that the criminal\nlaw often treats as the equivalent. Thus, we include reck-\nless conduct of the kind set forth in the Model Penal\nCode. Where actual knowledge of wrongdoing is lacking, we\nconsider conduct as equivalent if the fiduciary “consciously\ndisregards” (or is willfully blind to) “a substantial and\nunjustifiable risk” that his conduct will turn out to violate\na fiduciary duty. ALI, Model Penal Code §2.02(2)(c), p.\n226 (1985). See id., §2.02 Comment 9, at 248 (explaining\nthat the Model Penal Code’s definition of “knowledge” was\ndesigned to include “ ‘wilful blindness’ ”). That risk “must\nbe of such a nature and degree that, considering the\nnature and purpose of the actor’s conduct and the cir-\ncumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross\ndeviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding\nperson would observe in the actor’s situation.”           Id.,\n§2.02(2)(c), at 226 (emphasis added). Cf. Ernst & Ernst v.\nHochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 194, n. 12 (1976) (defining\nscienter for securities law purposes as “a mental state\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nembracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”).\n                              2\n   Several considerations lead us to interpret the statutory\nterm “defalcation” in this way. First, as Justice Harlan\npointed out in Neal, statutory context strongly favors this\ninterpretation.     Applying the canon of interpretation\nnoscitur a sociis, the Court there looked to fraud’s linguis-\ntic neighbor, “embezzlement.” It found that both terms\nrefer to different forms of generally similar conduct. It\nwrote that both are “ ‘ejusdem generis,’ ” of the same kind,\nand that both are “ ‘referable to the same subject-matter.’ ”\n95 U. S., at 709. Moreover, embezzlement requires a\nshowing of wrongful intent. Ibid. (noting that embezzle-\nment “involv[es] moral turpitude or intentional wrong”).\nSee Moore v. United States, 160 U. S. 268, 269–270 (1895)\n(describing embezzlement and larceny as requiring “felo-\nnious intent”). See also, e.g., W. LaFave, Criminal Law\n§19.6(a), p. 995 (5th ed. 2010) (“intent to deprive” is part of\nembezzlement). Hence, the Court concluded, “fraud” must\nrequire an equivalent showing. Neal, supra, at 709. Neal\nhas been the law for more than a century. And here, the\nadditional neighbors (“larceny” and, as defined in Neal,\n“fraud”) mean that the canon noscitur a sociis argues even\nmore strongly for similarly interpreting the similar statu-\ntory term “defalcation.”\n   Second, this interpretation does not make the word\nidentical to its statutory neighbors. See Babbitt v. Sweet\nHome Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S.\n687, 698 (1995) (noting “[a] reluctance to treat statutory\nterms as surplusage”). As commonly used, “embezzlement”\nrequires conversion, and “larceny” requires taking and\ncarrying away another’s property. See LaFave, Criminal\nLaw §§19.2, 19.5 (larceny); id., §19.6 (embezzlement).\n“Fraud” typically requires a false statement or omission.\nSee id., §19.7 (discussing fraud in the context of false\n8            BULLOCK v. BANKCHAMPAIGN, N. A.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npretenses). “Defalcation,” as commonly used (hence as\nCongress might have understood it), can encompass a\nbreach of fiduciary obligation that involves neither conver-\nsion, nor taking and carrying away another’s property, nor\nfalsity. Black’s 479. See, e.g., In re Frankel, 77 B. R. 401\n(Bkrtcy. Ct. WDNY 1987) (finding a breach of fiduciary\nduty and defalcation based on an unreasonable sale of\nassets).\n  Nor are embezzlement, larceny, and fiduciary fraud\nsimply special cases of defalcation as so defined. The\nstatutory provision makes clear that the first two terms\napply outside of the fiduciary context; and “defalcation,”\nunlike “fraud,” may be used to refer to nonfraudulent\nbreaches of fiduciary duty. Black’s 479.\n  Third, the interpretation is consistent with the long-\nstanding principle that “exceptions to discharge ‘should\nbe confined to those plainly expressed.’ ” Kawaauhau v.\nGeiger, 523 U. S. 57, 62 (1998) (quoting Gleason v.\nThaw, 236 U. S. 558, 562 (1915)). See Local Loan Co.\nv. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 244 (1934); Neal, supra, at 709. It\nis also consistent with a set of statutory exceptions that\nCongress normally confines to circumstances where strong,\nspecial policy considerations, such as the presence of\nfault, argue for preserving the debt, thereby benefiting,\nfor example, a typically more honest creditor. See, e.g., 11\nU. S. C. §§523(a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), (a)(6), (a)(9) (fault). See\nalso, e.g., §§523(a)(1), (a)(7), (a)(14), (a)(14A) (taxes);\n§523(a)(8) (educational loans); §523(a)(15) (spousal and\nchild support). In the absence of fault, it is difficult to find\nstrong policy reasons favoring a broader exception here, at\nleast in respect to those whom a scienter requirement will\nmost likely help, namely nonprofessional trustees, perhaps\nadministering small family trusts potentially immersed in\nintrafamily arguments that are difficult to evaluate in\nterms of comparative fault.\n  Fourth, as far as the briefs before us reveal, at least\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

See also In re Hyman,\n502 F. 3d 61, 69 (CA2 2007) (“This [scienter] standard . . .\nalso has the virtue of ease of application since the courts\nand litigants have reference to a robust body of securities\nlaw examining what these terms mean”).\n   Finally, it is important to have a uniform interpreta-\ntion of federal law, the choices are limited, and neither\nthe parties nor the Government has presented us with\nstrong considerations favoring a different interpretation. In\naddition to those we have already discussed, the Govern-\nment has pointed to the fact that in 1970 Congress\nrewrote the statute, eliminating the word “misappropria-\ntion” and placing the term “defalcation” (previously in a\ndifferent exemption provision) alongside its present three\nneighbors. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16–17. The Government believes that these changes\nsupport reading “defalcation” without a scienter require-\nment. But one might argue, with equal plausibility, that\nthe changes reflect a decision to make certain that courts\nwould read in similar ways “defalcation,” “fraud,” “embez-\nzlement,” and “larceny.” In fact, we believe the 1970\nchanges are inconclusive.\n                              III\n  In this case the Court of Appeals applied a standard of\n“objectiv[e] reckless[ness]” to facts presented at summary\njudgment. 670 F. 3d, at 1166. We consequently remand\nthe case to permit the court to determine whether further\nproceedings are needed and, if so, to apply the heightened\nstandard that we have set forth. For these reasons we\nvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/867644/", "sha1": "e8d078e8d127f5320ca78cf2c8ad1d105c1640d3", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-042", "time_retrieved": "2013-05-13T07:13:53.806699"}
