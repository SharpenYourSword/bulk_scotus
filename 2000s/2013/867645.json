ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11\u2013796.      Argued February 19, 2013\u2014Decided May 13, 2013\nRespondent Monsanto invented and patented Roundup Ready soybean\n  seeds, which contain a genetic alteration that allows them to survive\n  exposure to the herbicide glyphosate. It sells the seeds subject to a\n  licensing agreement that permits farmers to plant the purchased\n  seed in one, and only one, growing season. Growers may consume or\n  sell the resulting crops, but may not save any of the harvested soy-\n  beans for replanting. Petitioner Bowman purchased Roundup Ready\n  soybean seed for his first crop of each growing season from a company\n  associated with Monsanto and followed the terms of the licensing\n  agreement. But to reduce costs for his riskier late-season planting,\n  Bowman purchased soybeans intended for consumption from a grain\n  elevator; planted them; treated the plants with glyphosate, killing all\n  plants without the Roundup Ready trait; harvested the resulting\n  soybeans that contained that trait; and saved some of these harvest-\n  ed seeds to use in his late-season planting the next season. After dis-\n  covering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringe-\n  ment. Bowman raised the defense of patent exhaustion, which gives\n  the purchaser of a patented article, or any subsequent owner, the\n  right to use or resell that article. The District Court rejected Bow-\n  man\u2019s defense and the Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patent-\n ed seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder\u2019s\n permission. Pp. 4\u201310.\n    (a) Under the patent exhaustion doctrine, \u201cthe initial authorized\n sale of a patented article terminates all patent rights to that item,\u201d\n Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U. S. 617, 625,\n and confers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, \u201cthe right to\n use [or] sell\u201d the thing as he sees fit, United States v. Univis Lens Co.,\n2                      BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    316 U. S. 241, 249\u2013250. However, the doctrine restricts the patent-\n    ee\u2019s rights only as to the \u201cparticular article\u201d sold, id., at 251; it leaves\n    untouched the patentee\u2019s ability to prevent a buyer from making new\n    copies of the patented item. By planting and harvesting Monsanto\u2019s\n    patented seeds, Bowman made additional copies of Monsanto\u2019s pa-\n    tented invention, and his conduct thus falls outside the protections of\n    patent exhaustion. Were this otherwise, Monsanto\u2019s patent would\n    provide scant benefit. After Monsanto sold its first seed, other seed\n    companies could produce the patented seed to compete with Monsan-\n    to, and farmers would need to buy seed only once. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Bowman argues that exhaustion should apply here because he\n    is using seeds in the normal way farmers do, and thus allowing Mon-\n    santo to interfere with that use would create an impermissible excep-\n    tion to the exhaustion doctrine for patented seeds. But it is really\n    Bowman who is asking for an exception to the well-settled rule that\n    exhaustion does not extend to the right to make new copies of the pa-\n    tented item. If Bowman was granted that exception, patents on\n    seeds would retain little value. Further, applying the normal rule\n    will allow farmers to make effective use of patented seeds. Bowman,\n    who purchased seeds intended for consumption, stands in a peculiar-\n    ly poor position to argue that he cannot make effective use of his soy-\n    beans. Bowman conceded that he knew of no other farmer who\n    planted soybeans bought from a grain elevator. In the more ordinary\n    case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed from Monsanto\n    or an affiliate, he will be able to plant it in accordance with Monsan-\n    to\u2019s license to make one crop.

Such a\nsale, however, does not allow the purchaser to make new\ncopies of the patented invention. The question in this case\nis whether a farmer who buys patented seeds may repro-\nduce them through planting and harvesting without the\npatent holder\u2019s permission. We hold that he may not.\n                              I\n  Respondent Monsanto invented a genetic modification\nthat enables soybean plants to survive exposure to glypho-\nsate, the active ingredient in many herbicides (including\nMonsanto\u2019s own Roundup). Monsanto markets soybean seed\ncontaining this altered genetic material as Roundup Ready\nseed. Farmers planting that seed can use a glyphosate-\nbased herbicide to kill weeds without damaging their crops.\nTwo patents issued to Monsanto cover various aspects\nof its Roundup Ready technology, including a seed in-\ncorporating the genetic alteration. See Supp. App. SA1\u201321\n(U. S. Patent Nos. 5,352,605 and RE39,247E); see also\n2               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n657 F. 3d 1341, 1343\u20131344 (CA Fed. 2011).\n   Monsanto sells, and allows other companies to sell,\nRoundup Ready soybean seeds to growers who assent to a\nspecial licensing agreement. See App. 27a. That agree-\nment permits a grower to plant the purchased seeds in one\n(and only one) season. He can then consume the resulting\ncrop or sell it as a commodity, usually to a grain elevator\nor agricultural processor. See 657 F. 3d, at 1344\u20131345.\nBut under the agreement, the farmer may not save any of\nthe harvested soybeans for replanting, nor may he supply\nthem to anyone else for that purpose. These restrictions\nreflect the ease of producing new generations of Roundup\nReady seed. Because glyphosate resistance comes from\nthe seed\u2019s genetic material, that trait is passed on from\nthe planted seed to the harvested soybeans: Indeed, a\nsingle Roundup Ready seed can grow a plant containing\ndozens of genetically identical beans, each of which, if\nreplanted, can grow another such plant\u2014and so on and so\non. See App. 100a. The agreement\u2019s terms prevent the\nfarmer from co-opting that process to produce his own\nRoundup Ready seeds, forcing him instead to buy from\nMonsanto each season.\n   Petitioner Vernon Bowman is a farmer in Indiana who,\nit is fair to say, appreciates Roundup Ready soybean seed.\nHe purchased Roundup Ready each year, from a company\naffiliated with Monsanto, for his first crop of the season.\nIn accord with the agreement just described, he used all of\nthat seed for planting, and sold his entire crop to a grain\nelevator (which typically would resell it to an agricultural\nprocessor for human or animal consumption).\n   Bowman, however, devised a less orthodox approach for\nhis second crop of each season. Because he thought such\nlate-season planting \u201crisky,\u201d he did not want to pay the\npremium price that Monsanto charges for Roundup Ready\nseed. Id., at 78a; see Brief for Petitioner 6. He therefore\nwent to a grain elevator; purchased \u201ccommodity soybeans\u201d\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nintended for human or animal consumption; and planted\nthem in his fields.1 Those soybeans came from prior har-\nvests of other local farmers. And because most of those\nfarmers also used Roundup Ready seed, Bowman could\nanticipate that many of the purchased soybeans would\ncontain Monsanto\u2019s patented technology. When he applied\na glyphosate-based herbicide to his fields, he confirmed\nthat this was so; a significant proportion of the new plants\nsurvived the treatment, and produced in their turn a new\ncrop of soybeans with the Roundup Ready trait. Bowman\nsaved seed from that crop to use in his late-season plant-\ning the next year\u2014and then the next, and the next, until\nhe had harvested eight crops in that way. Each year, that\nis, he planted saved seed from the year before (sometimes\nadding more soybeans bought from the grain elevator),\nsprayed his fields with glyphosate to kill weeds (and any\nnon-resistant plants), and produced a new crop of glyphosate-\nresistant\u2014i.e., Roundup Ready\u2014soybeans.\n   After discovering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman\nfor infringing its patents on Roundup Ready seed. Bow-\nman raised patent exhaustion as a defense, arguing that\nMonsanto could not control his use of the soybeans be-\ncause they were the subject of a prior authorized sale\n(from local farmers to the grain elevator). The District\nCourt rejected that argument, and awarded damages to\nMonsanto of $84,456. The Federal Circuit affirmed. It\nreasoned that patent exhaustion did not protect Bowman\nbecause he had \u201ccreated a newly infringing article.\u201d 657\nF. 3d, at 1348. The \u201cright to use\u201d a patented article follow-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Grain elevators, as indicated above, purchase grain from farmers\n\nand sell it for consumption; under federal and state law, they generally\ncannot package or market their grain for use as agricultural seed. See\n7 U. S. C. \u00a71571; Ind. Code \u00a715\u201315\u20131\u201332 (2012). But because soybeans\nare themselves seeds, nothing (except, as we shall see, the law) pre-\nvented Bowman from planting, rather than consuming, the product he\nbought from the grain elevator.\n4                    BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ning an authorized sale, the court explained, \u201cdoes not\ninclude the right to construct an essentially new article on\nthe template of the original, for the right to make the\narticle remains with the patentee.\u201d Ibid. (brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, Bowman\ncould not \u201c \u2018replicate\u2019 Monsanto\u2019s patented technology by\nplanting it in the ground to create newly infringing genetic\nmaterial, seeds, and plants.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari to consider the important ques-\ntion of patent law raised in this case, 568 U. S. ___ (2012),\nand now affirm.\n                               II\n  The doctrine of patent exhaustion limits a patentee\u2019s\nright to control what others can do with an article embody-\ning or containing an invention.2 Under the doctrine, \u201cthe\ninitial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all\npatent rights to that item.\u201d Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG\nElectronics, Inc., 553 U. S. 617, 625 (2008). And by \u201cex-\nhaust[ing] the [patentee\u2019s] monopoly\u201d in that item, the sale\nconfers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, \u201cthe\nright to use [or] sell\u201d the thing as he sees fit. United\nStates v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S. 241, 249\u2013250 (1942).\nWe have explained the basis for the doctrine as follows:\n\u201c[T]he purpose of the patent law is fulfilled with respect to\nany particular article when the patentee has received his\nreward . . . by the sale of the article\u201d; once that \u201cpurpose is\nrealized the patent law affords no basis for restraining the\nuse and enjoyment of the thing sold.\u201d Id., at 251.\n  Consistent with that rationale, the doctrine restricts a\npatentee\u2019s rights only as to the \u201cparticular article\u201d sold,\nibid.; it leaves untouched the patentee\u2019s ability to prevent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 ThePatent Act grants a patentee the \u201cright to exclude others from\nmaking, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention.\u201d 35 U. S. C.\n\u00a7154(a)(1); see \u00a7271(a) (\u201c[W]hoever without authority makes, uses,\noffers to sell, or sells any patented invention . . . infringes the patent\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\na buyer from making new copies of the patented item.\n\u201c[T]he purchaser of the [patented] machine . . . does not\nacquire any right to construct another machine either for\nhis own use or to be vended to another.\u201d Mitchell v.\nHawley, 16 Wall. 544, 548 (1873); see Wilbur-Ellis Co. v.\nKuther, 377 U. S. 422, 424 (1964) (holding that a purchas-\ner\u2019s \u201creconstruction\u201d of a patented machine \u201cwould im-\npinge on the patentee\u2019s right \u2018to exclude others from mak-\ning\u2019 . . . the article\u201d (quoting 35 U. S. C. \u00a7154 (1964 ed.))).\nRather, \u201ca second creation\u201d of the patented item \u201ccall[s]\nthe monopoly, conferred by the patent grant, into play for\na second time.\u201d Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replace-\nment Co., 365 U. S. 336, 346 (1961). That is because the\npatent holder has \u201creceived his reward\u201d only for the actual\narticle sold, and not for subsequent recreations of it.\nUnivis, 316 U. S., at 251. If the purchaser of that article\ncould make and sell endless copies, the patent would\neffectively protect the invention for just a single sale.\nBowman himself disputes none of this analysis as a gen-\neral matter: He forthrightly acknowledges the \u201cwell set-\ntled\u201d principle \u201cthat the exhaustion doctrine does not\nextend to the right to \u2018make\u2019 a new product.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 37 (citing Aro, 365 U. S., at 346).\n   Unfortunately for Bowman, that principle decides this\ncase against him. Under the patent exhaustion doctrine,\nBowman could resell the patented soybeans he purchased\nfrom the grain elevator; so too he could consume the beans\nhimself or feed them to his animals. Monsanto, although\nthe patent holder, would have no business interfering in\nthose uses of Roundup Ready beans. But the exhaustion\ndoctrine does not enable Bowman to make additional\npatented soybeans without Monsanto\u2019s permission (either\nexpress or implied). And that is precisely what Bowman\ndid. He took the soybeans he purchased home; planted\nthem in his fields at the time he thought best; applied\nglyphosate to kill weeds (as well as any soy plants lacking\n6                   BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Roundup Ready trait); and finally harvested more\n(many more) beans than he started with. That is how \u201cto\n\u2018make\u2019 a new product,\u201d to use Bowman\u2019s words, when the\noriginal product is a seed. Brief for Petitioner 37; see\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1363 (1961)\n(\u201cmake\u201d means \u201ccause to exist, occur, or appear,\u201d or more\nspecifically, \u201cplant and raise (a crop)\u201d). Because Bowman\nthus reproduced Monsanto\u2019s patented invention, the ex-\nhaustion doctrine does not protect him.3\n  Were the matter otherwise, Monsanto\u2019s patent would\nprovide scant benefit. After inventing the Roundup Ready\ntrait, Monsanto would, to be sure, \u201creceiv[e] [its] reward\u201d\nfor the first seeds it sells. Univis, 316 U. S., at 251. But\nin short order, other seed companies could reproduce the\nproduct and market it to growers, thus depriving Mon-\nsanto of its monopoly. And farmers themselves need only\nbuy the seed once, whether from Monsanto, a competitor,\nor (as here) a grain elevator. The grower could multiply\nhis initial purchase, and then multiply that new creation,\nad infinitum\u2014each time profiting from the patented seed\nwithout compensating its inventor. Bowman\u2019s late-season\nplantings offer a prime illustration. After buying beans\nfor a single harvest, Bowman saved enough seed each year\nto reduce or eliminate the need for additional purchases.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This conclusion applies however Bowman acquired Roundup Ready\n\nseed: The doctrine of patent exhaustion no more protected Bowman\u2019s\nreproduction of the seed he purchased for his first crop (from a Monsanto-\naffiliated seed company) than the beans he bought for his second\n(from a grain elevator). The difference between the two purchases was\nthat the first\u2014but not the second\u2014came with a license from Monsanto\nto plant the seed and then harvest and market one crop of beans. We\ndo not here confront a case in which Monsanto (or an affiliated seed\ncompany) sold Roundup Ready to a farmer without an express license\nagreement. For reasons we explain below, we think that case unlikely\nto arise. See infra, at 9. And in the event it did, the farmer might\nreasonably claim that the sale came with an implied license to plant\nand harvest one soybean crop.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMonsanto still held its patent, but received no gain from\nBowman\u2019s annual production and sale of Roundup Ready\nsoybeans. The exhaustion doctrine is limited to the \u201cpar-\nticular item\u201d sold to avoid just such a mismatch between\ninvention and reward.\n   Our holding today also follows from J. E. M. Ag Supply,\nInc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124 (2001).\nWe considered there whether an inventor could get a\npatent on a seed or plant, or only a certificate issued under\nthe Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), 7 U. S. C. \u00a72321\net seq. We decided a patent was available, rejecting the\nclaim that the PVPA implicitly repealed the Patent Act\u2019s\ncoverage of seeds and plants. On our view, the two stat-\nutes established different, but not conflicting schemes:\nThe requirements for getting a patent \u201care more stringent\nthan those for obtaining a PVP certificate, and the pro-\ntections afforded\u201d by a patent are correspondingly greater.\nJ. E. M., 534 U. S., at 142. Most notable here, we ex-\nplained that only a patent holder (not a certificate holder)\ncould prohibit \u201c[a] farmer who legally purchases and\nplants\u201d a protected seed from saving harvested seed \u201cfor\nreplanting.\u201d Id., at 140; see id., at 143 (noting that the\nPatent Act, unlike the PVPA, contains \u201cno exemptio[n]\u201d for\n\u201csaving seed\u201d). That statement is inconsistent with apply-\ning exhaustion to protect conduct like Bowman\u2019s. If a sale\ncut off the right to control a patented seed\u2019s progeny, then\n(contrary to J. E. M.) the patentee could not prevent the\nbuyer from saving harvested seed. Indeed, the patentee\ncould not stop the buyer from selling such seed, which\neven a PVP certificate owner (who, recall, is supposed to\nhave fewer rights) can usually accomplish. See 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72541, 2543. Those limitations would turn upside-down\nthe statutory scheme J. E. M. described.\n   Bowman principally argues that exhaustion should\napply here because seeds are meant to be planted. The\nexhaustion doctrine, he reminds us, typically prevents a\n8               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npatentee from controlling the use of a patented product\nfollowing an authorized sale. And in planting Roundup\nReady seeds, Bowman continues, he is merely using them\nin the normal way farmers do. Bowman thus concludes\nthat allowing Monsanto to interfere with that use would\n\u201ccreat[e] an impermissible exception to the exhaustion\ndoctrine\u201d for patented seeds and other \u201cself-replicating\ntechnologies.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16.\n   But it is really Bowman who is asking for an unprece-\ndented exception\u2014to what he concedes is the \u201cwell settled\u201d\nrule that \u201cthe exhaustion doctrine does not extend to the\nright to \u2018make\u2019 a new product.\u201d See supra, at 5. Reproduc-\ning a patented article no doubt \u201cuses\u201d it after a fashion.\nBut as already explained, we have always drawn the\nboundaries of the exhaustion doctrine to exclude that\nactivity, so that the patentee retains an undiminished\nright to prohibit others from making the thing his patent\nprotects. See, e.g., Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons, 106 U. S.\n89, 93\u201394 (1882) (holding that a purchaser could not \u201cuse\u201d\nthe buckle from a patented cotton-bale tie to \u201cmake\u201d a new\ntie). That is because, once again, if simple copying were a\nprotected use, a patent would plummet in value after the\nfirst sale of the first item containing the invention. The\nundiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend\nnot for 20 years (as the Patent Act promises), but for only\none transaction. And that would result in less incentive\nfor innovation than Congress wanted. Hence our repeated\ninsistence that exhaustion applies only to the particular\nitem sold, and not to reproductions.\n   Nor do we think that rule will prevent farmers from\nmaking appropriate use of the Roundup Ready seed they\nbuy. Bowman himself stands in a peculiarly poor position\nto assert such a claim. As noted earlier, the commodity\nsoybeans he purchased were intended not for planting, but\nfor consumption. See supra, at 2\u20133. Indeed, Bowman\nconceded in deposition testimony that he knew of no other\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfarmer who employed beans bought from a grain elevator\nto grow a new crop. See App. 84a. So a non-replicating\nuse of the commodity beans at issue here was not just\navailable, but standard fare. And in the more ordinary\ncase, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed qua\nseed\u2014that is, seed intended to grow a crop\u2014he will be\nable to plant it. Monsanto, to be sure, conditions the\nfarmer\u2019s ability to reproduce Roundup Ready; but it does\nnot\u2014could not realistically\u2014preclude all planting. No\nsane farmer, after all, would buy the product without\nsome ability to grow soybeans from it. And so Monsanto,\npredictably enough, sells Roundup Ready seed to farmers\nwith a license to use it to make a crop. See supra, at 2, 6,\nn. 3. Applying our usual rule in this context therefore will\nallow farmers to benefit from Roundup Ready, even as it\nrewards Monsanto for its innovation.\n  Still, Bowman has another seeds-are-special argument:\nthat soybeans naturally \u201cself-replicate or \u2018sprout\u2019 unless\nstored in a controlled manner,\u201d and thus \u201cit was the planted\nsoybean, not Bowman\u201d himself, that made replicas of\nMonsanto\u2019s patented invention. Brief for Petitioner 42;\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[F]armers, when they plant seeds,\nthey don\u2019t exercise any control . . . over their crop\u201d or \u201cover\nthe creative process\u201d). But we think that blame-the-bean\ndefense tough to credit. Bowman was not a passive ob-\nserver of his soybeans\u2019 multiplication; or put another way,\nthe seeds he purchased (miraculous though they might be\nin other respects) did not spontaneously create eight suc-\ncessive soybean crops. As we have explained, supra at\n2\u20133, Bowman devised and executed a novel way to harvest\ncrops from Roundup Ready seeds without paying the usual\npremium. He purchased beans from a grain elevator\nanticipating that many would be Roundup Ready; applied\na glyphosate-based herbicide in a way that culled any\nplants without the patented trait; and saved beans from\nthe rest for the next season. He then planted those\n10               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRoundup Ready beans at a chosen time; tended and treated\nthem, including by exploiting their patented glyphosate-\nresistance; and harvested many more seeds, which he\neither marketed or saved to begin the next cycle. In all\nthis, the bean surely figured. But it was Bowman, and not\nthe bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth\ngeneration) of Monsanto\u2019s patented invention.\n   Our holding today is limited\u2014addressing the situa-\ntion before us, rather than every one involving a self-\nreplicating product. We recognize that such inventions\nare becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse.\nIn another case, the article\u2019s self-replication might occur\noutside the purchaser\u2019s control. Or it might be a necessary\nbut incidental step in using the item for another purpose.\nCf. 17 U. S.

We need not address here whether or\nhow the doctrine of patent exhaustion would apply in such\ncircumstances. In the case at hand, Bowman planted\nMonsanto\u2019s patented soybeans solely to make and market\nreplicas of them, thus depriving the company of the re-\nward patent law provides for the sale of each article.\nPatent exhaustion provides no haven for that conduct.

Argued February 19, 2013\u2014Decided May 13, 2013\nRespondent Monsanto invented and patented Roundup Ready soybean\n  seeds, which contain a genetic alteration that allows them to survive\n  exposure to the herbicide glyphosate. It sells the seeds subject to a\n  licensing agreement that permits farmers to plant the purchased\n  seed in one, and only one, growing season. Growers may consume or\n  sell the resulting crops, but may not save any of the harvested soy-\n  beans for replanting. Petitioner Bowman purchased Roundup Ready\n  soybean seed for his first crop of each growing season from a company\n  associated with Monsanto and followed the terms of the licensing\n  agreement. But to reduce costs for his riskier late-season planting,\n  Bowman purchased soybeans intended for consumption from a grain\n  elevator; planted them; treated the plants with glyphosate, killing all\n  plants without the Roundup Ready trait; harvested the resulting\n  soybeans that contained that trait; and saved some of these harvest-\n  ed seeds to use in his late-season planting the next season. After dis-\n  covering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringe-\n  ment. Bowman raised the defense of patent exhaustion, which gives\n  the purchaser of a patented article, or any subsequent owner, the\n  right to use or resell that article. The District Court rejected Bow-\n  man\u2019s defense and the Federal Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patent-\n ed seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder\u2019s\n permission.

However, the doctrine restricts the patent-\n    ee\u2019s rights only as to the \u201cparticular article\u201d sold, id., at 251; it leaves\n    untouched the patentee\u2019s ability to prevent a buyer from making new\n    copies of the patented item. By planting and harvesting Monsanto\u2019s\n    patented seeds, Bowman made additional copies of Monsanto\u2019s pa-\n    tented invention, and his conduct thus falls outside the protections of\n    patent exhaustion. Were this otherwise, Monsanto\u2019s patent would\n    provide scant benefit. After Monsanto sold its first seed, other seed\n    companies could produce the patented seed to compete with Monsan-\n    to, and farmers would need to buy seed only once. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) Bowman argues that exhaustion should apply here because he\n    is using seeds in the normal way farmers do, and thus allowing Mon-\n    santo to interfere with that use would create an impermissible excep-\n    tion to the exhaustion doctrine for patented seeds. But it is really\n    Bowman who is asking for an exception to the well-settled rule that\n    exhaustion does not extend to the right to make new copies of the pa-\n    tented item. If Bowman was granted that exception, patents on\n    seeds would retain little value. Further, applying the normal rule\n    will allow farmers to make effective use of patented seeds. Bowman,\n    who purchased seeds intended for consumption, stands in a peculiar-\n    ly poor position to argue that he cannot make effective use of his soy-\n    beans. Bowman conceded that he knew of no other farmer who\n    planted soybeans bought from a grain elevator. In the more ordinary\n    case, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed from Monsanto\n    or an affiliate, he will be able to plant it in accordance with Monsan-\n    to\u2019s license to make one crop.

Such a\nsale, however, does not allow the purchaser to make new\ncopies of the patented invention. The question in this case\nis whether a farmer who buys patented seeds may repro-\nduce them through planting and harvesting without the\npatent holder\u2019s permission. We hold that he may not.\n                              I\n  Respondent Monsanto invented a genetic modification\nthat enables soybean plants to survive exposure to glypho-\nsate, the active ingredient in many herbicides (including\nMonsanto\u2019s own Roundup). Monsanto markets soybean seed\ncontaining this altered genetic material as Roundup Ready\nseed. Farmers planting that seed can use a glyphosate-\nbased herbicide to kill weeds without damaging their crops.\nTwo patents issued to Monsanto cover various aspects\nof its Roundup Ready technology, including a seed in-\ncorporating the genetic alteration. See Supp. App. SA1\u201321\n(U. S. Patent Nos. 5,352,605 and RE39,247E); see also\n2               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n657 F. 3d 1341, 1343\u20131344 (CA Fed. 2011).\n   Monsanto sells, and allows other companies to sell,\nRoundup Ready soybean seeds to growers who assent to a\nspecial licensing agreement. See App. 27a. That agree-\nment permits a grower to plant the purchased seeds in one\n(and only one) season. He can then consume the resulting\ncrop or sell it as a commodity, usually to a grain elevator\nor agricultural processor. See 657 F. 3d, at 1344\u20131345.\nBut under the agreement, the farmer may not save any of\nthe harvested soybeans for replanting, nor may he supply\nthem to anyone else for that purpose. These restrictions\nreflect the ease of producing new generations of Roundup\nReady seed. Because glyphosate resistance comes from\nthe seed\u2019s genetic material, that trait is passed on from\nthe planted seed to the harvested soybeans: Indeed, a\nsingle Roundup Ready seed can grow a plant containing\ndozens of genetically identical beans, each of which, if\nreplanted, can grow another such plant\u2014and so on and so\non. See App. 100a. The agreement\u2019s terms prevent the\nfarmer from co-opting that process to produce his own\nRoundup Ready seeds, forcing him instead to buy from\nMonsanto each season.\n   Petitioner Vernon Bowman is a farmer in Indiana who,\nit is fair to say, appreciates Roundup Ready soybean seed.\nHe purchased Roundup Ready each year, from a company\naffiliated with Monsanto, for his first crop of the season.\nIn accord with the agreement just described, he used all of\nthat seed for planting, and sold his entire crop to a grain\nelevator (which typically would resell it to an agricultural\nprocessor for human or animal consumption).\n   Bowman, however, devised a less orthodox approach for\nhis second crop of each season. Because he thought such\nlate-season planting \u201crisky,\u201d he did not want to pay the\npremium price that Monsanto charges for Roundup Ready\nseed. Id., at 78a; see Brief for Petitioner 6. He therefore\nwent to a grain elevator; purchased \u201ccommodity soybeans\u201d\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nintended for human or animal consumption; and planted\nthem in his fields.1 Those soybeans came from prior har-\nvests of other local farmers. And because most of those\nfarmers also used Roundup Ready seed, Bowman could\nanticipate that many of the purchased soybeans would\ncontain Monsanto\u2019s patented technology. When he applied\na glyphosate-based herbicide to his fields, he confirmed\nthat this was so; a significant proportion of the new plants\nsurvived the treatment, and produced in their turn a new\ncrop of soybeans with the Roundup Ready trait. Bowman\nsaved seed from that crop to use in his late-season plant-\ning the next year\u2014and then the next, and the next, until\nhe had harvested eight crops in that way. Each year, that\nis, he planted saved seed from the year before (sometimes\nadding more soybeans bought from the grain elevator),\nsprayed his fields with glyphosate to kill weeds (and any\nnon-resistant plants), and produced a new crop of glyphosate-\nresistant\u2014i.e., Roundup Ready\u2014soybeans.\n   After discovering this practice, Monsanto sued Bowman\nfor infringing its patents on Roundup Ready seed. Bow-\nman raised patent exhaustion as a defense, arguing that\nMonsanto could not control his use of the soybeans be-\ncause they were the subject of a prior authorized sale\n(from local farmers to the grain elevator). The District\nCourt rejected that argument, and awarded damages to\nMonsanto of $84,456. The Federal Circuit affirmed. It\nreasoned that patent exhaustion did not protect Bowman\nbecause he had \u201ccreated a newly infringing article.\u201d 657\nF. 3d, at 1348. The \u201cright to use\u201d a patented article follow-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Grain elevators, as indicated above, purchase grain from farmers\n\nand sell it for consumption; under federal and state law, they generally\ncannot package or market their grain for use as agricultural seed. See\n7 U. S. C. \u00a71571; Ind. Code \u00a715\u201315\u20131\u201332 (2012). But because soybeans\nare themselves seeds, nothing (except, as we shall see, the law) pre-\nvented Bowman from planting, rather than consuming, the product he\nbought from the grain elevator.\n4                    BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\ning an authorized sale, the court explained, \u201cdoes not\ninclude the right to construct an essentially new article on\nthe template of the original, for the right to make the\narticle remains with the patentee.\u201d Ibid. (brackets and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, Bowman\ncould not \u201c \u2018replicate\u2019 Monsanto\u2019s patented technology by\nplanting it in the ground to create newly infringing genetic\nmaterial, seeds, and plants.\u201d Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari to consider the important ques-\ntion of patent law raised in this case, 568 U. S. ___ (2012),\nand now affirm.\n                               II\n  The doctrine of patent exhaustion limits a patentee\u2019s\nright to control what others can do with an article embody-\ning or containing an invention.2 Under the doctrine, \u201cthe\ninitial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all\npatent rights to that item.\u201d Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG\nElectronics, Inc., 553 U. S. 617, 625 (2008). And by \u201cex-\nhaust[ing] the [patentee\u2019s] monopoly\u201d in that item, the sale\nconfers on the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, \u201cthe\nright to use [or] sell\u201d the thing as he sees fit. United\nStates v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S. 241, 249\u2013250 (1942).\nWe have explained the basis for the doctrine as follows:\n\u201c[T]he purpose of the patent law is fulfilled with respect to\nany particular article when the patentee has received his\nreward . . . by the sale of the article\u201d; once that \u201cpurpose is\nrealized the patent law affords no basis for restraining the\nuse and enjoyment of the thing sold.\u201d Id., at 251.\n  Consistent with that rationale, the doctrine restricts a\npatentee\u2019s rights only as to the \u201cparticular article\u201d sold,\nibid.; it leaves untouched the patentee\u2019s ability to prevent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 ThePatent Act grants a patentee the \u201cright to exclude others from\nmaking, using, offering for sale, or selling the invention.\u201d 35 U.

That is because the\npatent holder has \u201creceived his reward\u201d only for the actual\narticle sold, and not for subsequent recreations of it.\nUnivis, 316 U. S., at 251. If the purchaser of that article\ncould make and sell endless copies, the patent would\neffectively protect the invention for just a single sale.\nBowman himself disputes none of this analysis as a gen-\neral matter: He forthrightly acknowledges the \u201cwell set-\ntled\u201d principle \u201cthat the exhaustion doctrine does not\nextend to the right to \u2018make\u2019 a new product.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 37 (citing Aro, 365 U. S., at 346).\n   Unfortunately for Bowman, that principle decides this\ncase against him. Under the patent exhaustion doctrine,\nBowman could resell the patented soybeans he purchased\nfrom the grain elevator; so too he could consume the beans\nhimself or feed them to his animals. Monsanto, although\nthe patent holder, would have no business interfering in\nthose uses of Roundup Ready beans. But the exhaustion\ndoctrine does not enable Bowman to make additional\npatented soybeans without Monsanto\u2019s permission (either\nexpress or implied). And that is precisely what Bowman\ndid. He took the soybeans he purchased home; planted\nthem in his fields at the time he thought best; applied\nglyphosate to kill weeds (as well as any soy plants lacking\n6                   BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Roundup Ready trait); and finally harvested more\n(many more) beans than he started with. That is how \u201cto\n\u2018make\u2019 a new product,\u201d to use Bowman\u2019s words, when the\noriginal product is a seed. Brief for Petitioner 37; see\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1363 (1961)\n(\u201cmake\u201d means \u201ccause to exist, occur, or appear,\u201d or more\nspecifically, \u201cplant and raise (a crop)\u201d). Because Bowman\nthus reproduced Monsanto\u2019s patented invention, the ex-\nhaustion doctrine does not protect him.3\n  Were the matter otherwise, Monsanto\u2019s patent would\nprovide scant benefit. After inventing the Roundup Ready\ntrait, Monsanto would, to be sure, \u201creceiv[e] [its] reward\u201d\nfor the first seeds it sells. Univis, 316 U. S., at 251. But\nin short order, other seed companies could reproduce the\nproduct and market it to growers, thus depriving Mon-\nsanto of its monopoly. And farmers themselves need only\nbuy the seed once, whether from Monsanto, a competitor,\nor (as here) a grain elevator. The grower could multiply\nhis initial purchase, and then multiply that new creation,\nad infinitum\u2014each time profiting from the patented seed\nwithout compensating its inventor. Bowman\u2019s late-season\nplantings offer a prime illustration. After buying beans\nfor a single harvest, Bowman saved enough seed each year\nto reduce or eliminate the need for additional purchases.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 This conclusion applies however Bowman acquired Roundup Ready\n\nseed: The doctrine of patent exhaustion no more protected Bowman\u2019s\nreproduction of the seed he purchased for his first crop (from a Monsanto-\naffiliated seed company) than the beans he bought for his second\n(from a grain elevator). The difference between the two purchases was\nthat the first\u2014but not the second\u2014came with a license from Monsanto\nto plant the seed and then harvest and market one crop of beans. We\ndo not here confront a case in which Monsanto (or an affiliated seed\ncompany) sold Roundup Ready to a farmer without an express license\nagreement. For reasons we explain below, we think that case unlikely\nto arise. See infra, at 9. And in the event it did, the farmer might\nreasonably claim that the sale came with an implied license to plant\nand harvest one soybean crop.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nMonsanto still held its patent, but received no gain from\nBowman\u2019s annual production and sale of Roundup Ready\nsoybeans. The exhaustion doctrine is limited to the \u201cpar-\nticular item\u201d sold to avoid just such a mismatch between\ninvention and reward.\n   Our holding today also follows from J. E. M. Ag Supply,\nInc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124 (2001).\nWe considered there whether an inventor could get a\npatent on a seed or plant, or only a certificate issued under\nthe Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), 7 U. S. C. \u00a72321\net seq. We decided a patent was available, rejecting the\nclaim that the PVPA implicitly repealed the Patent Act\u2019s\ncoverage of seeds and plants. On our view, the two stat-\nutes established different, but not conflicting schemes:\nThe requirements for getting a patent \u201care more stringent\nthan those for obtaining a PVP certificate, and the pro-\ntections afforded\u201d by a patent are correspondingly greater.\nJ. E. M., 534 U. S., at 142. Most notable here, we ex-\nplained that only a patent holder (not a certificate holder)\ncould prohibit \u201c[a] farmer who legally purchases and\nplants\u201d a protected seed from saving harvested seed \u201cfor\nreplanting.\u201d Id., at 140; see id., at 143 (noting that the\nPatent Act, unlike the PVPA, contains \u201cno exemptio[n]\u201d for\n\u201csaving seed\u201d). That statement is inconsistent with apply-\ning exhaustion to protect conduct like Bowman\u2019s. If a sale\ncut off the right to control a patented seed\u2019s progeny, then\n(contrary to J. E. M.) the patentee could not prevent the\nbuyer from saving harvested seed. Indeed, the patentee\ncould not stop the buyer from selling such seed, which\neven a PVP certificate owner (who, recall, is supposed to\nhave fewer rights) can usually accomplish. See 7 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a72541, 2543. Those limitations would turn upside-down\nthe statutory scheme J. E. M. described.\n   Bowman principally argues that exhaustion should\napply here because seeds are meant to be planted. The\nexhaustion doctrine, he reminds us, typically prevents a\n8               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npatentee from controlling the use of a patented product\nfollowing an authorized sale. And in planting Roundup\nReady seeds, Bowman continues, he is merely using them\nin the normal way farmers do. Bowman thus concludes\nthat allowing Monsanto to interfere with that use would\n\u201ccreat[e] an impermissible exception to the exhaustion\ndoctrine\u201d for patented seeds and other \u201cself-replicating\ntechnologies.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 16.\n   But it is really Bowman who is asking for an unprece-\ndented exception\u2014to what he concedes is the \u201cwell settled\u201d\nrule that \u201cthe exhaustion doctrine does not extend to the\nright to \u2018make\u2019 a new product.\u201d See supra, at 5. Reproduc-\ning a patented article no doubt \u201cuses\u201d it after a fashion.\nBut as already explained, we have always drawn the\nboundaries of the exhaustion doctrine to exclude that\nactivity, so that the patentee retains an undiminished\nright to prohibit others from making the thing his patent\nprotects. See, e.g., Cotton-Tie Co. v. Simmons, 106 U. S.\n89, 93\u201394 (1882) (holding that a purchaser could not \u201cuse\u201d\nthe buckle from a patented cotton-bale tie to \u201cmake\u201d a new\ntie). That is because, once again, if simple copying were a\nprotected use, a patent would plummet in value after the\nfirst sale of the first item containing the invention. The\nundiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend\nnot for 20 years (as the Patent Act promises), but for only\none transaction. And that would result in less incentive\nfor innovation than Congress wanted. Hence our repeated\ninsistence that exhaustion applies only to the particular\nitem sold, and not to reproductions.\n   Nor do we think that rule will prevent farmers from\nmaking appropriate use of the Roundup Ready seed they\nbuy. Bowman himself stands in a peculiarly poor position\nto assert such a claim. As noted earlier, the commodity\nsoybeans he purchased were intended not for planting, but\nfor consumption. See supra, at 2\u20133. Indeed, Bowman\nconceded in deposition testimony that he knew of no other\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfarmer who employed beans bought from a grain elevator\nto grow a new crop. See App. 84a. So a non-replicating\nuse of the commodity beans at issue here was not just\navailable, but standard fare. And in the more ordinary\ncase, when a farmer purchases Roundup Ready seed qua\nseed\u2014that is, seed intended to grow a crop\u2014he will be\nable to plant it. Monsanto, to be sure, conditions the\nfarmer\u2019s ability to reproduce Roundup Ready; but it does\nnot\u2014could not realistically\u2014preclude all planting. No\nsane farmer, after all, would buy the product without\nsome ability to grow soybeans from it. And so Monsanto,\npredictably enough, sells Roundup Ready seed to farmers\nwith a license to use it to make a crop. See supra, at 2, 6,\nn. 3. Applying our usual rule in this context therefore will\nallow farmers to benefit from Roundup Ready, even as it\nrewards Monsanto for its innovation.\n  Still, Bowman has another seeds-are-special argument:\nthat soybeans naturally \u201cself-replicate or \u2018sprout\u2019 unless\nstored in a controlled manner,\u201d and thus \u201cit was the planted\nsoybean, not Bowman\u201d himself, that made replicas of\nMonsanto\u2019s patented invention. Brief for Petitioner 42;\nsee Tr. of Oral Arg. 14 (\u201c[F]armers, when they plant seeds,\nthey don\u2019t exercise any control . . . over their crop\u201d or \u201cover\nthe creative process\u201d). But we think that blame-the-bean\ndefense tough to credit. Bowman was not a passive ob-\nserver of his soybeans\u2019 multiplication; or put another way,\nthe seeds he purchased (miraculous though they might be\nin other respects) did not spontaneously create eight suc-\ncessive soybean crops. As we have explained, supra at\n2\u20133, Bowman devised and executed a novel way to harvest\ncrops from Roundup Ready seeds without paying the usual\npremium. He purchased beans from a grain elevator\nanticipating that many would be Roundup Ready; applied\na glyphosate-based herbicide in a way that culled any\nplants without the patented trait; and saved beans from\nthe rest for the next season. He then planted those\n10               BOWMAN v. MONSANTO CO.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nRoundup Ready beans at a chosen time; tended and treated\nthem, including by exploiting their patented glyphosate-\nresistance; and harvested many more seeds, which he\neither marketed or saved to begin the next cycle. In all\nthis, the bean surely figured. But it was Bowman, and not\nthe bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth\ngeneration) of Monsanto\u2019s patented invention.\n   Our holding today is limited\u2014addressing the situa-\ntion before us, rather than every one involving a self-\nreplicating product. We recognize that such inventions\nare becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse.\nIn another case, the article\u2019s self-replication might occur\noutside the purchaser\u2019s control. Or it might be a necessary\nbut incidental step in using the item for another purpose.\nCf. 17 U. S. C. \u00a7117(a)(1) (\u201c[I]t is not [a copyright] in-\nfringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program\nto make . . . another copy or adaptation of that computer\nprogram provide[d] that such a new copy or adaptation is\ncreated as an essential step in the utilization of the com-\nputer program\u201d). We need not address here whether or\nhow the doctrine of patent exhaustion would apply in such\ncircumstances. In the case at hand, Bowman planted\nMonsanto\u2019s patented soybeans solely to make and market\nreplicas of them, thus depriving the company of the re-\nward patent law provides for the sale of each article.\nPatent exhaustion provides no haven for that conduct. We\naccordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Federal Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
