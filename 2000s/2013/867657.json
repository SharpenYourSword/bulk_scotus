PELKEY\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       No. 12\u201352. Argued March 20, 2013\u2014Decided May 13, 2013\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n  (FAAAA) preempts state laws \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of\n  any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d\n  49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1). This provision borrows from the Airline De-\n  regulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws \u201crelated to a\n  price, route, or service of an air carrier,\u201d \u00a741713(b)(1), but it adds the\n  important qualification, \u201cwith respect to transportation of property.\u201d\n     Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Supe-\n  rior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dan\u2019s City Used Cars\n  (Dan\u2019s City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it\n  from his landlord\u2019s parking lot without Pelkey\u2019s knowledge, failed to\n  notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite\n  Pelkey\u2019s notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually\n  traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his\n  vehicle. In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dan\u2019s City did\n  not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New\n  Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal\n  of abandoned vehicles by a \u201cstorage company.\u201d Dan\u2019s City\u2019s miscon-\n  duct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshire\u2019s Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act and breached the towing company\u2019s statutory and com-\n  mon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession\n  of a bailor\u2019s property. The court granted summary judgment to Dan\u2019s\n  City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkey\u2019s claims. The\n  New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held the FAAAA\u2019s\n  preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkey\u2019s claims related to\n  Dan\u2019s City\u2019s conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to con-\n  duct concerning \u201cthe transportation of property,\u201d or a towing com-\n  pany\u2019s \u201cservice.\u201d\n2             DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming\n from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (a) Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute,\n this Court\u2019s task is to \u201cidentify the domain expressly pre-empted,\u201d\n Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 541, focusing first on\n the statutory language, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.\n 658, 664. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S.\n 364, 370, this Court\u2019s reading of \u00a714501(c)(1) was informed by deci-\n sions interpreting parallel language in the ADA\u2019s preemption clause.\n Thus, the Court held, the phrase \u201crelated to\u201d embraces state laws\n \u201chaving a connection with or reference to\u201d carrier \u201c \u2018rates, routes, or\n services,\u2019 \u201d whether directly or indirectly. Ibid. At the same time, the\n breadth of the words \u201crelated to\u201d does not mean that the preemption\n clause should be read with an \u201cuncritical literalism.\u201d New York State\n Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\n 514 U. S. 645, 655\u2013656. The Court has cautioned that \u00a714501(c)(1)\n does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and ser-\n vices \u201cin only a \u2018tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner.\u2019 \u201d Rowe,\n 552 U. S., at 371. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Pelkey\u2019s state-law claims escape preemption because they are\n \u201crelated to\u201d neither the \u201ctransportation of property\u201d nor the \u201cservice\u201d\n of a motor carrier. Although \u00a714501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA\u2019s\n air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation\u2019s one con-\n spicuous alteration\u2014addition of the words \u201cwith respect to the trans-\n portation of property\u201d\u2014significantly limits the FAAAA\u2019s preemptive\n scope. It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the \u201cprice, route,\n or service\u201d of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also con-\n cern a motor carrier\u2019s \u201ctransportation of property.\u201d Title 49 defines\n \u201ctransportation,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cservices related to th[e] move-\n ment\u201d of property, \u201cincluding arranging for . . . storage [and] han-\n dling.\u201d \u00a713102(23)(B). Pelkey\u2019s Consumer Protection Act and negli-\n gence claims are not \u201crelated to th[e] movement\u201d of his car. Chapter\n 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation\u2014\n here, by towing\u2014has ended. Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct\n occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored. Dan\u2019s City\n maintains that because \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d\n includes \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling,\u201d Pelkey\u2019s claims fall within\n \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive ambit. But \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling\u201d fit\n within \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition only when those services \u201crelat[e] to\n th[e] movement\u201d of property. Thus temporary storage of an item in\n transit en route to its final destination qualifies as \u201ctransportation,\u201d\n but permanent storage does not. Here, no storage occurred in the\n course of transporting Pelkey\u2019s vehicle.\n    Pelkey\u2019s claims are also unrelated to a \u201cservice\u201d a motor carrier\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  renders its customers. The transportation service Dan\u2019s City pro-\n  vided\u2014removal of Pelkey\u2019s car from his landlord\u2019s parking lot\u2014did\n  involve the movement of property, but that service ended months be-\n  fore the conduct on which Pelkey\u2019s claims are based. Because chapter\n  262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses \u201cstorage compan[ies]\u201d and\n  \u201cgarage owner[s] or keeper[s],\u201d not transportation activities, it has\n  neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services\n  a motor carrier offers its customers. See Rowe, 552 U. S., at 371.\n     The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed\n  vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress\u2019 purpose in\n  enacting \u00a714501(c)(1), which was to displace \u201ca State\u2019s direct substi-\n  tution of its own governmental commands for \u2018competitive market\n  forces\u2019 in determining . . . the services that motor carriers will pro-\n  vide.\u201d Id., at 372. The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes\n  hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a\n  motor carrier to offer services not available in the market. Nor do\n  they \u201cfreez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\n  tinue in the future.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 8\u201311.\n     (c) Dan\u2019s City\u2019s additional arguments in favor of preemption are not\n  persuasive. Dan\u2019s City contends that because none of Pelkey\u2019s claims\n  fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted. But excep-\n  tions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in them-\n  selves delineate the scope of the rule. Here, the exceptions identify\n  matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded\n  from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n     Dan\u2019s City also maintains that Pelkey\u2019s claims are \u201crelated to\u201d its\n  towing service because selling Pelkey\u2019s car was the means by which\n  Dan\u2019s City obtained payment for the tow. If such state-law claims\n  were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-\n  based dispute arising from a towing company\u2019s disposal of a vehicle\n  previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal. No such\n  design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See Silkwood v.\n  Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251. Pp. 11\u201313.\n163 N.

ROBERT PELKEY\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                    NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                                [May 13, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the preemptive scope of a provision\nof the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act\nof 1994 (FAAAA or Act) applicable to motor carriers. Codi-\nfied at 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1), the provision reads:\n    \u201c[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regula-\n    tion, or other provision having the force and effect of\n    law related to a price, route, or service of any motor\n    carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of\n    property.\u201d\nPlaintiff-respondent Robert Pelkey brought suit under\nNew Hampshire law against defendant-petitioner Dan\u2019s\nCity Used Cars (Dan\u2019s City), a towing company. Pelkey al-\nleged that Dan\u2019s City took custody of his car after towing\nit without Pelkey\u2019s knowledge, failed to notify him of its\nplan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkey\u2019s\ncommunication that he wanted to arrange for the car\u2019s\nreturn, and eventually traded the car away without com-\npensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.\n   Disposal of abandoned vehicles by a \u201cstorage company\u201d\nis regulated by chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised\n2          DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStatutes Annotated. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7262:31 to\n262:40\u2013c (West 2004 and 2012 West Cum. Supp.). Dan\u2019s\nCity relied on those laws to dispose of Pelkey\u2019s vehicle\nfor nonpayment of towing and storage fees. According to\nPelkey, however, Dan\u2019s City failed to comply with New\nHampshire\u2019s provisions governing the sale of stored vehi-\ncles and the application of sale proceeds. Pelkey charged\nthat Dan\u2019s City\u2019s disposal of his car without following the\nrequirements contained in chapter 262 violated the New\nHampshire Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7358\u2013A:2 (West\n2009), as well as Dan\u2019s City\u2019s statutory and common-law\nduties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in pos-\nsession of a bailor\u2019s property.\n  We hold, in accord with the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt, that state-law claims stemming from the storage\nand disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not\nsufficiently connected to a motor carrier\u2019s service with\nrespect to the transportation of property to warrant pre-\nemption under \u00a714501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in\npoint regulates no towing services, no carriage of prop-\nerty. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles\nseeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State\u2019s\nregulation of that activity by any federal prescription.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 92 Stat.\n1705, largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.\nIn keeping with the statute\u2019s aim to achieve \u201cmaximum\nreliance on competitive market forces,\u201d id., at 1706, Con-\ngress sought to \u201censure that the States would not undo\nfederal deregulation with regulation of their own.\u201d Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378\n(1992). Congress therefore included a preemption provi-\nsion, now codified at 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713(b)(1), prohibiting\nStates from enacting or enforcing any law \u201crelated to a\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprice, route, or service of an air carrier.\u201d\n    Two years later, the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 94\nStat. 793, extended deregulation to the trucking industry.\nCongress completed the deregulation 14 years thereafter,\nin 1994, by expressly preempting state trucking regula-\ntion. Congress did so upon finding that state governance\nof intrastate transportation of property had become \u201cun-\nreasonably burden[some]\u201d to \u201cfree trade, interstate com-\nmerce, and American consumers.\u201d Columbus v. Ours Ga-\nrage & Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002)\n(citing FAAAA \u00a7601(a)(1), 108 Stat. 1605). Borrowing\nfrom the ADA\u2019s preemption clause, but adding a new\nqualification, \u00a7601(c) of the FAAAA supersedes state laws\n\u201crelated to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier\n. . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 108\nStat. 1606, now codified at 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1) (em-\nphasis added).1 The Act exempts certain measures from\nits preemptive scope, including state laws regulating\nmotor vehicle safety, size, and weight; motor carrier in-\nsurance; and the intrastate transportation of household\ngoods. \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2)(A)\u2013(B). Also exempted from preemp-\ntion are state laws \u201crelating to the price\u201d of \u201cvehicle trans-\nportation by a tow truck,\u201d if towing occurs without prior\nconsent of the vehicle owner. \u00a714501(c)(2)(C).\n    This case involves the interaction between the FAAAA\u2019s\npreemption clause and the State of New Hampshire\u2019s\nregulation of the removal, storage, and disposal of aban-\ndoned motor vehicles. Chapter 262 of the New Hampshire\nRevised Statutes Annotated establishes procedures by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The term \u201cmotor carrier\u201d is defined as \u201ca person providing motor\n\nvehicle transportation for compensation.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a713102(14) (2006\ned., Supp. V). We have previously recognized that tow trucks qualify\nas \u201cmotor carriers\u201d under \u00a714501(c)(1). Columbus v. Ours Garage &\nWrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 430 (2002). Dan\u2019s City\u2019s qualifica-\ntion as a motor carrier under the FAAAA is uncontested by the parties.\nSee Brief for Petitioner i; Brief for Respondent 18.\n4           DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich an \u201cauthorized official\u201d or the \u201cowner . . . of any\nprivate property . . . on which a vehicle is parked without\npermission\u201d may arrange to have the vehicle towed and\nstored. N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7262:31 to 262:34, 262:40\u2013\na(I). It generally makes the owner of a towed vehicle\nresponsible for reasonable removal and storage fees. See\n\u00a7262:33(I) (reasonable removal and storage charges \u201cshall\nbe a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the\nowner\u201d); \u00a7262:33(II) (owner entitled to recover vehicle\nafter \u201cpayment of all reasonable towing and storage\ncharges\u201d); \u00a7262:40\u2013a(II) (owner of a vehicle towed from a\nparking lot or parking garage is responsible for \u201cremoval\nand storage charges\u201d when the lot or garage conspicuously\nposts notice of parking restrictions).\n  Under chapter 262, the custodian of a car that remains\nunclaimed for 30 days following a tow may dispose of the\nvehicle upon compliance with notice requirements.\n\u00a7\u00a7262:36\u2013a(I), (II). A \u201cgarage owner or keeper\u201d must post\nnotices of an impending sale in public places and provide\nmail notice to the vehicle owner whenever the owner\u2019s\naddress may \u201cbe ascertained . . . by the exercise of reason-\nable diligence.\u201d \u00a7262:38. If a towed vehicle is not fit\nfor legal use, its custodian need not provide individual\nor public notice prior to disposal, and sale of the vehicle\nmay occur upon written notice to and approval from\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Department of Public Safety. \u00a7262:36\u2013\na(III).2\n  On compliance with the statutory requirements, the\ncustodian of a stored vehicle may sell the vehicle by public\nauction at its place of business. \u00a7262:37.

Pelkey\u2019s 2004 Honda Civic remained in the\nlot during and after a February 2007 snowstorm. At the\nlandlord\u2019s request, Dan\u2019s City towed and stored the vehi-\ncle. Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,\nPelkey did not know his car had been towed. Soon after\nremoval of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for\na procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he\nsuffered a heart attack. He remained under hospital care\nuntil his discharge on April 9, 2007.\n   Unaware of Pelkey\u2019s identity or illness, Dan\u2019s City\nsought permission from New Hampshire\u2019s Department of\nPublic Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.\nIn response, the department identified Pelkey as the last\nknown owner of the vehicle. Dan\u2019s City wrote to Pelkey,\nnotifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.\nWhen the post office returned the letter, checking the box\n\u201cmoved, left no address,\u201d Dan\u2019s City scheduled an auction\nfor April 19. Meanwhile, in the days following Pelkey\u2019s\ndischarge from the hospital, his attorney learned from\ncounsel for the apartment complex that the car had been\ntowed by Dan\u2019s City and was scheduled to be sold at pub-\nlic auction. On April 17, Pelkey\u2019s attorney informed\nDan\u2019s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and\nreclaim his vehicle. Dan\u2019s City nevertheless proceeded\nwith the auction. Attracting no bidders, Dan\u2019s City later\ndisposed of the car by trading it to a third party. Pelkey\nwas not notified in advance of the trade, and has received\nno proceeds from the sale.\n6            DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Pelkey brought suit against Dan\u2019s City in New Hamp-\nshire Superior Court. He alleged that Dan\u2019s City violated\nthe New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, N. H.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7358\u2013A:2, by failing to comply with chap-\nter 262\u2019s requirements for disposal of stored vehicles, mak-\ning false statements about the condition and value of his\nHonda, and proceeding with the auction despite notice\nthat Pelkey wanted to reclaim the car.3 He also alleged\nthat Dan\u2019s City negligently breached both statutory and\ncommon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care in\ndisposing of the car. Granting summary judgment to\nDan\u2019s City, the New Hampshire Superior Court concluded\nthat Pelkey\u2019s claims were preempted by the FAAAA.\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held\nthe FAAAA\u2019s preemption clause, 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1),\ninapplicable because Pelkey\u2019s claims related to Dan\u2019s\nCity\u2019s conduct in disposing of his Honda post-storage, not\nto conduct concerning \u201cthe transportation of property.\u201d\n163 N.

Alternatively, the court ruled that,\neven if Pelkey\u2019s claims could be said to concern the trans-\nportation of property, they did not \u201csufficiently relat[e] to a\ntowing company\u2019s \u2018service\u2019 to be preempted.\u201d Id., at 493,\n44 A. 3d, at 490.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in\nstate supreme courts on whether 49 U.

We agree.\n  Pelkey\u2019s claims escape preemption, we hold, because\nthey are not \u201crelated to\u201d the service of a motor carrier\n\u201cwith respect to the transportation of property.\u201d\n\u00a714501(c)(1). Although \u00a714501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the\nADA\u2019s air-carrier preemption provision, see Rowe, 552\nU. S., at 370, the FAAAA formulation contains one con-\nspicuous alteration\u2014the addition of the words \u201cwith re-\nspect to the transportation of property.\u201d That phrase\n\u201cmassively limits the scope of preemption\u201d ordered by the\nFAAAA. Ours Garage, 536 U. S., at 449 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting).4 As the New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly\nunderstood, for purposes of FAAAA preemption, it is not\nsufficient that a state law relates to the \u201cprice, route, or\nservice\u201d of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must\nalso concern a motor carrier\u2019s \u201ctransportation of property.\u201d\nSee 163 N.

Pelkey\u2019s Consumer Protection\nAct and negligence claims are not \u201crelated to th[e] move-\nment\u201d of his car. Ibid. (emphasis added). He charges\nDan\u2019s City with failure to comply with chapter 262 and\nneglect of its statutory and common-law duties of care as\na bailee of his stored vehicle. Chapter 262 does not limit\nwhen, where, or how tow trucks may be operated. The\nChapter regulates, instead, the disposal of vehicles once\ntheir transportation\u2014here, by towing\u2014has ended. Pelkey\ndoes not object to the manner in which his car was moved\nor the price of the tow; he seeks redress only for conduct\nsubsequent to \u201ctransportation,\u201d conduct occurring after\nthe car ceased moving and was stored.\n   Dan\u2019s City maintains that because \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201ctransportation\u201d includes \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chan-\ndling,\u201d Pelkey\u2019s claims, which do concern the storage and\nhandling of his car, fall within \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemp-\ntive ambit. Dan\u2019s City overlooks, however, that under\n\u00a713102(23)(B), services such as \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling\u201d\nfit within the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d only when\nthose services \u201crelat[e] to th[e] movement\u201d of property.\nTemporary storage of an item in transit en route to its\nfinal destination relates to the movement of property and\ntherefore fits within \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition. But prop-\nerty stored after delivery is no longer in transit. Cf. 49\nCFR \u00a7375.609 (2012) (distinguishing between \u201cstorage-in-\ntransit\u201d and \u201cpermanent storage\u201d (regulation of Federal\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration)). Here, no storage\noccurred in the course of transporting Pelkey\u2019s vehicle.\nDan\u2019s City\u2019s storage of Pelkey\u2019s car after the towing job\nwas done, in short, does not involve \u201ctransportation\u201d with-\nin the meaning of the federal Act.\n   Pelkey\u2019s claims also survive preemption under\n\u00a714501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a \u201cservice\u201d a\nmotor carrier renders its customers. The transportation\n10           DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nservice Dan\u2019s City provided was the removal of Pelkey\u2019s\ncar from his landlord\u2019s parking lot. That service, which\ndid involve the movement of property, ended months\nbefore the conduct on which Pelkey\u2019s claims are based.\nHis claims rely on New Hampshire\u2019s abandoned vehicle\ndisposal regime, prescribed in chapter 262, for the rules\ngoverning Dan\u2019s City\u2019s conduct.5 Chapter 262 addresses\n\u201cstorage compan[ies]\u201d and \u201cgarage owner[s] or keeper[s],\u201d\nnot transportation activities.       See N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a7262:36\u2013a, 262:38. Unlike Maine\u2019s tobacco delivery\nregulations at issue in Rowe, chapter 262 has neither a\ndirect nor an indirect connection to any transportation\nservices a motor carrier offers its customers. See 552\nU. S., at 371. We need not venture an all-purposes defini-\ntion of transportation \u201cservice[s]\u201d in order to conclude that\nstate-law claims homing in on the disposal of stored vehi-\ncles fall outside \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive compass.\n   Our conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal\nof towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord\nwith Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a714501(c)(1). Concerned\nthat state regulation \u201cimpeded the free flow of trade,\ntraffic, and transportation of interstate commerce,\u201d Con-\ngress resolved to displace \u201ccertain aspects of the State\nregulatory process.\u201d FAAAA \u00a7601(a), 108 Stat. 1605 (em-\nphasis added). The target at which it aimed was \u201ca State\u2019s\ndirect substitution of its own governmental commands for\ncompetitive market forces in determining (to a signifi-\ncant degree) the services that motor carriers will pro-\nvide.\u201d Rowe, 552 U.

This dispute\nturns on interpretation of state law, a matter on which we express no\nopinion.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

He sued under state consumer protection and\ntort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful\ndisposal of his vehicle. The state laws in question hardly\nconstrain participation in interstate commerce by requir-\ning a motor carrier to offer services not available in the\nmarket. Nor do the state laws invoked by Pelkey \u201cfreez[e]\ninto place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\ntinue in the future.\u201d Ibid. New Hampshire\u2019s laws on dis-\nposal of stored vehicles, moreover, will not open the way for\n\u201ca patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Id., at 373. As Dan\u2019s City concedes, aban-\ndoned vehicle laws like chapter 262 \u201cdo not hamper the\noperations of tow truckers\u201d and \u201care not the kind of bur-\ndensome state economic regulation Congress sought to\npreempt.\u201d Reply Brief 21.\n                              C\n   Dan\u2019s City advances two further arguments in favor of\npreemption. First, Dan\u2019s City contends that Congress\u2019\nenumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regula-\ntion of motor carriers only when the State\u2019s law comes\nwithin a specified exception. Because Pelkey\u2019s claims do\nnot fit within any exception to preemption, Dan\u2019s City\nurges, those claims must be preempted. This argument\nexceeds sensible bounds. Exceptions to a general rule,\nwhile sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in\nthemselves delineate the scope of the rule. The exceptions\nto \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s general rule of preemption identify mat-\nters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be\nprecluded from doing so, but they do not control more than\nthat.\n   An example may clarify the point. Section 14501(c) does\nnot exempt zoning regulations. Such laws, however, \u201care\npeculiarly within the province of state and local legislative\nauthorities.\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508, n. 18\n12            DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1975). It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation\nof the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls\noutside the preemptive sweep of \u00a714501(c)(1). That is so\nbecause zoning ordinances ordinarily are not \u201crelated to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.\u201d \u00a714501(c)(1). The\nsame is true of New Hampshire\u2019s regulation of the dis-\nposal of stored vehicles.\n   Dan\u2019s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.\nPelkey\u2019s claims, Dan\u2019s City maintains, are \u201crelated to\u201d the\ntowing service it rendered because selling Pelkey\u2019s car was\nthe means by which Dan\u2019s City obtained payment for the\ntow. But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law\nwould govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute\narising from a towing company\u2019s disposal of a vehicle\npreviously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.\nFederal law does not speak to these issues.6 Thus, not\nonly would the preemption urged by Dan\u2019s City leave\nvehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would\neliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing com-\npany\u2019s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed. No\nsuch design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See\nSilkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984)\n(\u201cIt is difficult to believe that Congress would, without\ncomment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those\ninjured by illegal conduct.\u201d).\n   In sum, Dan\u2019s City cannot have it both ways. It cannot\nrely on New Hampshire\u2019s regulatory framework as author-\nization for the sale of Pelkey\u2019s car, yet argue that Pelkey\u2019s\nclaims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 There is an exception to Congress\u2019 silence, but it is of no aid to Dan\u2019s\n\nCity: The Act spares from preemption laws \u201crelating to the price of for-\nhire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation\nis performed [as it was here] without the prior consent or authorization\nof the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.\u201d                  49 U.

Argued March 20, 2013\u2014Decided May 13, 2013\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n  (FAAAA) preempts state laws \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of\n  any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d\n  49 U.

This provision borrows from the Airline De-\n  regulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws \u201crelated to a\n  price, route, or service of an air carrier,\u201d \u00a741713(b)(1), but it adds the\n  important qualification, \u201cwith respect to transportation of property.\u201d\n     Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Supe-\n  rior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dan\u2019s City Used Cars\n  (Dan\u2019s City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it\n  from his landlord\u2019s parking lot without Pelkey\u2019s knowledge, failed to\n  notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite\n  Pelkey\u2019s notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually\n  traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his\n  vehicle. In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dan\u2019s City did\n  not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New\n  Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal\n  of abandoned vehicles by a \u201cstorage company.\u201d Dan\u2019s City\u2019s miscon-\n  duct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshire\u2019s Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act and breached the towing company\u2019s statutory and com-\n  mon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession\n  of a bailor\u2019s property. The court granted summary judgment to Dan\u2019s\n  City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkey\u2019s claims. The\n  New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held the FAAAA\u2019s\n  preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkey\u2019s claims related to\n  Dan\u2019s City\u2019s conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to con-\n  duct concerning \u201cthe transportation of property,\u201d or a towing com-\n  pany\u2019s \u201cservice.\u201d\n2             DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming\n from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Pp. 7\u201313.\n    (a) Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute,\n this Court\u2019s task is to \u201cidentify the domain expressly pre-empted,\u201d\n Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 541, focusing first on\n the statutory language, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.\n 658, 664. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S.\n 364, 370, this Court\u2019s reading of \u00a714501(c)(1) was informed by deci-\n sions interpreting parallel language in the ADA\u2019s preemption clause.\n Thus, the Court held, the phrase \u201crelated to\u201d embraces state laws\n \u201chaving a connection with or reference to\u201d carrier \u201c \u2018rates, routes, or\n services,\u2019 \u201d whether directly or indirectly. Ibid. At the same time, the\n breadth of the words \u201crelated to\u201d does not mean that the preemption\n clause should be read with an \u201cuncritical literalism.\u201d New York State\n Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\n 514 U. S. 645, 655\u2013656. The Court has cautioned that \u00a714501(c)(1)\n does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and ser-\n vices \u201cin only a \u2018tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner.\u2019 \u201d Rowe,\n 552 U. S., at 371. Pp. 7\u20138.\n    (b) Pelkey\u2019s state-law claims escape preemption because they are\n \u201crelated to\u201d neither the \u201ctransportation of property\u201d nor the \u201cservice\u201d\n of a motor carrier. Although \u00a714501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA\u2019s\n air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation\u2019s one con-\n spicuous alteration\u2014addition of the words \u201cwith respect to the trans-\n portation of property\u201d\u2014significantly limits the FAAAA\u2019s preemptive\n scope. It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the \u201cprice, route,\n or service\u201d of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also con-\n cern a motor carrier\u2019s \u201ctransportation of property.\u201d Title 49 defines\n \u201ctransportation,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cservices related to th[e] move-\n ment\u201d of property, \u201cincluding arranging for . . . storage [and] han-\n dling.\u201d \u00a713102(23)(B). Pelkey\u2019s Consumer Protection Act and negli-\n gence claims are not \u201crelated to th[e] movement\u201d of his car. Chapter\n 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation\u2014\n here, by towing\u2014has ended. Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct\n occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored. Dan\u2019s City\n maintains that because \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d\n includes \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling,\u201d Pelkey\u2019s claims fall within\n \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive ambit. But \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling\u201d fit\n within \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition only when those services \u201crelat[e] to\n th[e] movement\u201d of property. Thus temporary storage of an item in\n transit en route to its final destination qualifies as \u201ctransportation,\u201d\n but permanent storage does not. Here, no storage occurred in the\n course of transporting Pelkey\u2019s vehicle.\n    Pelkey\u2019s claims are also unrelated to a \u201cservice\u201d a motor carrier\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  renders its customers. The transportation service Dan\u2019s City pro-\n  vided\u2014removal of Pelkey\u2019s car from his landlord\u2019s parking lot\u2014did\n  involve the movement of property, but that service ended months be-\n  fore the conduct on which Pelkey\u2019s claims are based. Because chapter\n  262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses \u201cstorage compan[ies]\u201d and\n  \u201cgarage owner[s] or keeper[s],\u201d not transportation activities, it has\n  neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services\n  a motor carrier offers its customers. See Rowe, 552 U. S., at 371.\n     The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed\n  vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress\u2019 purpose in\n  enacting \u00a714501(c)(1), which was to displace \u201ca State\u2019s direct substi-\n  tution of its own governmental commands for \u2018competitive market\n  forces\u2019 in determining . . . the services that motor carriers will pro-\n  vide.\u201d Id., at 372. The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes\n  hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a\n  motor carrier to offer services not available in the market. Nor do\n  they \u201cfreez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\n  tinue in the future.\u201d Ibid. Pp. 8\u201311.\n     (c) Dan\u2019s City\u2019s additional arguments in favor of preemption are not\n  persuasive. Dan\u2019s City contends that because none of Pelkey\u2019s claims\n  fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted. But excep-\n  tions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in them-\n  selves delineate the scope of the rule. Here, the exceptions identify\n  matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded\n  from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n     Dan\u2019s City also maintains that Pelkey\u2019s claims are \u201crelated to\u201d its\n  towing service because selling Pelkey\u2019s car was the means by which\n  Dan\u2019s City obtained payment for the tow. If such state-law claims\n  were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-\n  based dispute arising from a towing company\u2019s disposal of a vehicle\n  previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal. No such\n  design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See Silkwood v.\n  Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251. Pp. 11\u201313.\n163 N.

Codi-\nfied at 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1), the provision reads:\n    \u201c[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regula-\n    tion, or other provision having the force and effect of\n    law related to a price, route, or service of any motor\n    carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of\n    property.\u201d\nPlaintiff-respondent Robert Pelkey brought suit under\nNew Hampshire law against defendant-petitioner Dan\u2019s\nCity Used Cars (Dan\u2019s City), a towing company. Pelkey al-\nleged that Dan\u2019s City took custody of his car after towing\nit without Pelkey\u2019s knowledge, failed to notify him of its\nplan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkey\u2019s\ncommunication that he wanted to arrange for the car\u2019s\nreturn, and eventually traded the car away without com-\npensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.\n   Disposal of abandoned vehicles by a \u201cstorage company\u201d\nis regulated by chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised\n2          DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStatutes Annotated. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7262:31 to\n262:40\u2013c (West 2004 and 2012 West Cum. Supp.). Dan\u2019s\nCity relied on those laws to dispose of Pelkey\u2019s vehicle\nfor nonpayment of towing and storage fees. According to\nPelkey, however, Dan\u2019s City failed to comply with New\nHampshire\u2019s provisions governing the sale of stored vehi-\ncles and the application of sale proceeds. Pelkey charged\nthat Dan\u2019s City\u2019s disposal of his car without following the\nrequirements contained in chapter 262 violated the New\nHampshire Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7358\u2013A:2 (West\n2009), as well as Dan\u2019s City\u2019s statutory and common-law\nduties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in pos-\nsession of a bailor\u2019s property.\n  We hold, in accord with the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt, that state-law claims stemming from the storage\nand disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not\nsufficiently connected to a motor carrier\u2019s service with\nrespect to the transportation of property to warrant pre-\nemption under \u00a714501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in\npoint regulates no towing services, no carriage of prop-\nerty. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles\nseeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State\u2019s\nregulation of that activity by any federal prescription.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 92 Stat.\n1705, largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.\nIn keeping with the statute\u2019s aim to achieve \u201cmaximum\nreliance on competitive market forces,\u201d id., at 1706, Con-\ngress sought to \u201censure that the States would not undo\nfederal deregulation with regulation of their own.\u201d Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378\n(1992). Congress therefore included a preemption provi-\nsion, now codified at 49 U. S. C. \u00a741713(b)(1), prohibiting\nStates from enacting or enforcing any law \u201crelated to a\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Congress did so upon finding that state governance\nof intrastate transportation of property had become \u201cun-\nreasonably burden[some]\u201d to \u201cfree trade, interstate com-\nmerce, and American consumers.\u201d Columbus v. Ours Ga-\nrage & Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002)\n(citing FAAAA \u00a7601(a)(1), 108 Stat. 1605). Borrowing\nfrom the ADA\u2019s preemption clause, but adding a new\nqualification, \u00a7601(c) of the FAAAA supersedes state laws\n\u201crelated to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier\n. . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d 108\nStat. 1606, now codified at 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1) (em-\nphasis added).1 The Act exempts certain measures from\nits preemptive scope, including state laws regulating\nmotor vehicle safety, size, and weight; motor carrier in-\nsurance; and the intrastate transportation of household\ngoods. \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2)(A)\u2013(B). Also exempted from preemp-\ntion are state laws \u201crelating to the price\u201d of \u201cvehicle trans-\nportation by a tow truck,\u201d if towing occurs without prior\nconsent of the vehicle owner. \u00a714501(c)(2)(C).\n    This case involves the interaction between the FAAAA\u2019s\npreemption clause and the State of New Hampshire\u2019s\nregulation of the removal, storage, and disposal of aban-\ndoned motor vehicles. Chapter 262 of the New Hampshire\nRevised Statutes Annotated establishes procedures by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The term \u201cmotor carrier\u201d is defined as \u201ca person providing motor\n\nvehicle transportation for compensation.\u201d 49 U.

If a towed vehicle is not fit\nfor legal use, its custodian need not provide individual\nor public notice prior to disposal, and sale of the vehicle\nmay occur upon written notice to and approval from\nNew Hampshire\u2019s Department of Public Safety. \u00a7262:36\u2013\na(III).2\n  On compliance with the statutory requirements, the\ncustodian of a stored vehicle may sell the vehicle by public\nauction at its place of business. \u00a7262:37.

Pelkey\u2019s 2004 Honda Civic remained in the\nlot during and after a February 2007 snowstorm. At the\nlandlord\u2019s request, Dan\u2019s City towed and stored the vehi-\ncle. Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,\nPelkey did not know his car had been towed. Soon after\nremoval of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for\na procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he\nsuffered a heart attack. He remained under hospital care\nuntil his discharge on April 9, 2007.\n   Unaware of Pelkey\u2019s identity or illness, Dan\u2019s City\nsought permission from New Hampshire\u2019s Department of\nPublic Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.\nIn response, the department identified Pelkey as the last\nknown owner of the vehicle. Dan\u2019s City wrote to Pelkey,\nnotifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.\nWhen the post office returned the letter, checking the box\n\u201cmoved, left no address,\u201d Dan\u2019s City scheduled an auction\nfor April 19. Meanwhile, in the days following Pelkey\u2019s\ndischarge from the hospital, his attorney learned from\ncounsel for the apartment complex that the car had been\ntowed by Dan\u2019s City and was scheduled to be sold at pub-\nlic auction. On April 17, Pelkey\u2019s attorney informed\nDan\u2019s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and\nreclaim his vehicle. Dan\u2019s City nevertheless proceeded\nwith the auction. Attracting no bidders, Dan\u2019s City later\ndisposed of the car by trading it to a third party. Pelkey\nwas not notified in advance of the trade, and has received\nno proceeds from the sale.\n6            DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Pelkey brought suit against Dan\u2019s City in New Hamp-\nshire Superior Court. He alleged that Dan\u2019s City violated\nthe New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, N. H.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7358\u2013A:2, by failing to comply with chap-\nter 262\u2019s requirements for disposal of stored vehicles, mak-\ning false statements about the condition and value of his\nHonda, and proceeding with the auction despite notice\nthat Pelkey wanted to reclaim the car.3 He also alleged\nthat Dan\u2019s City negligently breached both statutory and\ncommon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care in\ndisposing of the car. Granting summary judgment to\nDan\u2019s City, the New Hampshire Superior Court concluded\nthat Pelkey\u2019s claims were preempted by the FAAAA.\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held\nthe FAAAA\u2019s preemption clause, 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1),\ninapplicable because Pelkey\u2019s claims related to Dan\u2019s\nCity\u2019s conduct in disposing of his Honda post-storage, not\nto conduct concerning \u201cthe transportation of property.\u201d\n163 N.

Alternatively, the court ruled that,\neven if Pelkey\u2019s claims could be said to concern the trans-\nportation of property, they did not \u201csufficiently relat[e] to a\ntowing company\u2019s \u2018service\u2019 to be preempted.\u201d Id., at 493,\n44 A. 3d, at 490.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in\nstate supreme courts on whether 49 U.

The phrase \u201crelated to,\u201d we said, embraces\nstate laws \u201chaving a connection with or reference to\u201d\ncarrier \u201c \u2018rates, routes, or services,\u2019 \u201d whether directly or\nindirectly.

S., at\n371 (quoting Morales, 504 U. S., at 390).\n                               B\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that\nPelkey\u2019s state-law claims are \u201crelated to\u201d neither the\n\u201ctransportation of property\u201d nor the \u201cservice\u201d of a motor\ncarrier. We agree.\n  Pelkey\u2019s claims escape preemption, we hold, because\nthey are not \u201crelated to\u201d the service of a motor carrier\n\u201cwith respect to the transportation of property.\u201d\n\u00a714501(c)(1). Although \u00a714501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the\nADA\u2019s air-carrier preemption provision, see Rowe, 552\nU. S., at 370, the FAAAA formulation contains one con-\nspicuous alteration\u2014the addition of the words \u201cwith re-\nspect to the transportation of property.\u201d That phrase\n\u201cmassively limits the scope of preemption\u201d ordered by the\nFAAAA. Ours Garage, 536 U. S., at 449 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting).4 As the New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly\nunderstood, for purposes of FAAAA preemption, it is not\nsufficient that a state law relates to the \u201cprice, route, or\nservice\u201d of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must\nalso concern a motor carrier\u2019s \u201ctransportation of property.\u201d\nSee 163 N. H., at 490, 44 A. 3d, at 487.\n  Title 49 defines \u201ctransportation,\u201d in relevant part, as\n\u201cservices related to th[e] movement\u201d of property, \u201cinclud-\ning arranging for, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in\ntransit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation, storage, handling,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Although this statement appears in the Ours Garage dissent, noth-\n\ning in the Court\u2019s opinion in that case is in any way inconsistent with\nthe dissent\u2019s characterization of \u00a714501(c)(1).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npacking, unpacking, and interchange of passengers and\nproperty.\u201d \u00a713102(23)(B). Pelkey\u2019s Consumer Protection\nAct and negligence claims are not \u201crelated to th[e] move-\nment\u201d of his car. Ibid. (emphasis added). He charges\nDan\u2019s City with failure to comply with chapter 262 and\nneglect of its statutory and common-law duties of care as\na bailee of his stored vehicle. Chapter 262 does not limit\nwhen, where, or how tow trucks may be operated. The\nChapter regulates, instead, the disposal of vehicles once\ntheir transportation\u2014here, by towing\u2014has ended. Pelkey\ndoes not object to the manner in which his car was moved\nor the price of the tow; he seeks redress only for conduct\nsubsequent to \u201ctransportation,\u201d conduct occurring after\nthe car ceased moving and was stored.\n   Dan\u2019s City maintains that because \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s\ndefinition of \u201ctransportation\u201d includes \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chan-\ndling,\u201d Pelkey\u2019s claims, which do concern the storage and\nhandling of his car, fall within \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemp-\ntive ambit. Dan\u2019s City overlooks, however, that under\n\u00a713102(23)(B), services such as \u201cstorage\u201d and \u201chandling\u201d\nfit within the definition of \u201ctransportation\u201d only when\nthose services \u201crelat[e] to th[e] movement\u201d of property.\nTemporary storage of an item in transit en route to its\nfinal destination relates to the movement of property and\ntherefore fits within \u00a713102(23)(B)\u2019s definition. But prop-\nerty stored after delivery is no longer in transit. Cf. 49\nCFR \u00a7375.609 (2012) (distinguishing between \u201cstorage-in-\ntransit\u201d and \u201cpermanent storage\u201d (regulation of Federal\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration)). Here, no storage\noccurred in the course of transporting Pelkey\u2019s vehicle.\nDan\u2019s City\u2019s storage of Pelkey\u2019s car after the towing job\nwas done, in short, does not involve \u201ctransportation\u201d with-\nin the meaning of the federal Act.\n   Pelkey\u2019s claims also survive preemption under\n\u00a714501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a \u201cservice\u201d a\nmotor carrier renders its customers. The transportation\n10           DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nservice Dan\u2019s City provided was the removal of Pelkey\u2019s\ncar from his landlord\u2019s parking lot. That service, which\ndid involve the movement of property, ended months\nbefore the conduct on which Pelkey\u2019s claims are based.\nHis claims rely on New Hampshire\u2019s abandoned vehicle\ndisposal regime, prescribed in chapter 262, for the rules\ngoverning Dan\u2019s City\u2019s conduct.5 Chapter 262 addresses\n\u201cstorage compan[ies]\u201d and \u201cgarage owner[s] or keeper[s],\u201d\nnot transportation activities.       See N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a7\u00a7262:36\u2013a, 262:38. Unlike Maine\u2019s tobacco delivery\nregulations at issue in Rowe, chapter 262 has neither a\ndirect nor an indirect connection to any transportation\nservices a motor carrier offers its customers. See 552\nU. S., at 371. We need not venture an all-purposes defini-\ntion of transportation \u201cservice[s]\u201d in order to conclude that\nstate-law claims homing in on the disposal of stored vehi-\ncles fall outside \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive compass.\n   Our conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal\nof towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord\nwith Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a714501(c)(1). Concerned\nthat state regulation \u201cimpeded the free flow of trade,\ntraffic, and transportation of interstate commerce,\u201d Con-\ngress resolved to displace \u201ccertain aspects of the State\nregulatory process.\u201d FAAAA \u00a7601(a), 108 Stat. 1605 (em-\nphasis added). The target at which it aimed was \u201ca State\u2019s\ndirect substitution of its own governmental commands for\ncompetitive market forces in determining (to a signifi-\ncant degree) the services that motor carriers will pro-\nvide.\u201d Rowe, 552 U. S., at 372 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Pelkey\u2019s claims are far removed from Congress\u2019 driving\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The parties dispute whether, as Pelkey alleges, conduct that violates\n\nchapter 262 may qualify as an unfair or deceptive act or practice\nproscribed by New Hampshire\u2019s Consumer Protection Act. This dispute\nturns on interpretation of state law, a matter on which we express no\nopinion.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcern. He sued under state consumer protection and\ntort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful\ndisposal of his vehicle. The state laws in question hardly\nconstrain participation in interstate commerce by requir-\ning a motor carrier to offer services not available in the\nmarket. Nor do the state laws invoked by Pelkey \u201cfreez[e]\ninto place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\ntinue in the future.\u201d Ibid. New Hampshire\u2019s laws on dis-\nposal of stored vehicles, moreover, will not open the way for\n\u201ca patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Id., at 373. As Dan\u2019s City concedes, aban-\ndoned vehicle laws like chapter 262 \u201cdo not hamper the\noperations of tow truckers\u201d and \u201care not the kind of bur-\ndensome state economic regulation Congress sought to\npreempt.\u201d Reply Brief 21.\n                              C\n   Dan\u2019s City advances two further arguments in favor of\npreemption. First, Dan\u2019s City contends that Congress\u2019\nenumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a714501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regula-\ntion of motor carriers only when the State\u2019s law comes\nwithin a specified exception. Because Pelkey\u2019s claims do\nnot fit within any exception to preemption, Dan\u2019s City\nurges, those claims must be preempted. This argument\nexceeds sensible bounds. Exceptions to a general rule,\nwhile sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in\nthemselves delineate the scope of the rule. The exceptions\nto \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s general rule of preemption identify mat-\nters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be\nprecluded from doing so, but they do not control more than\nthat.\n   An example may clarify the point. Section 14501(c) does\nnot exempt zoning regulations. Such laws, however, \u201care\npeculiarly within the province of state and local legislative\nauthorities.\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508, n. 18\n12            DAN\u2019S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1975). It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation\nof the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls\noutside the preemptive sweep of \u00a714501(c)(1). That is so\nbecause zoning ordinances ordinarily are not \u201crelated to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.\u201d \u00a714501(c)(1). The\nsame is true of New Hampshire\u2019s regulation of the dis-\nposal of stored vehicles.\n   Dan\u2019s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.\nPelkey\u2019s claims, Dan\u2019s City maintains, are \u201crelated to\u201d the\ntowing service it rendered because selling Pelkey\u2019s car was\nthe means by which Dan\u2019s City obtained payment for the\ntow. But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law\nwould govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute\narising from a towing company\u2019s disposal of a vehicle\npreviously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.\nFederal law does not speak to these issues.6 Thus, not\nonly would the preemption urged by Dan\u2019s City leave\nvehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would\neliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing com-\npany\u2019s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed. No\nsuch design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See\nSilkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984)\n(\u201cIt is difficult to believe that Congress would, without\ncomment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those\ninjured by illegal conduct.\u201d).\n   In sum, Dan\u2019s City cannot have it both ways. It cannot\nrely on New Hampshire\u2019s regulatory framework as author-\nization for the sale of Pelkey\u2019s car, yet argue that Pelkey\u2019s\nclaims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 There is an exception to Congress\u2019 silence, but it is of no aid to Dan\u2019s\n\nCity: The Act spares from preemption laws \u201crelating to the price of for-\nhire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation\nis performed [as it was here] without the prior consent or authorization\nof the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.\u201d                  49 U. S. C.\n\u00a714501(c)(2)(C).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7262:33,\n262:36\u2013a, 262:40\u2013a; supra, at 3\u20135.
