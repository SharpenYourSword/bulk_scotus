PELKEY\n\n  CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       No. 12–52. Argued March 20, 2013—Decided May 13, 2013\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n  (FAAAA) preempts state laws “related to a price, route, or service of\n  any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.”\n  49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1). This provision borrows from the Airline De-\n  regulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws “related to a\n  price, route, or service of an air carrier,” §41713(b)(1), but it adds the\n  important qualification, “with respect to transportation of property.”\n     Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Supe-\n  rior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dan’s City Used Cars\n  (Dan’s City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it\n  from his landlord’s parking lot without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to\n  notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite\n  Pelkey’s notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually\n  traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his\n  vehicle. In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dan’s City did\n  not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New\n  Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal\n  of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company.” Dan’s City’s miscon-\n  duct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshire’s Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act and breached the towing company’s statutory and com-\n  mon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession\n  of a bailor’s property. The court granted summary judgment to Dan’s\n  City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkey’s claims. The\n  New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held the FAAAA’s\n  preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to\n  Dan’s City’s conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to con-\n  duct concerning “the transportation of property,” or a towing com-\n  pany’s “service.”\n2             DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming\n from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Pp. 7–13.\n    (a) Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute,\n this Court’s task is to “identify the domain expressly pre-empted,”\n Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 541, focusing first on\n the statutory language, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.\n 658, 664. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S.\n 364, 370, this Court’s reading of §14501(c)(1) was informed by deci-\n sions interpreting parallel language in the ADA’s preemption clause.\n Thus, the Court held, the phrase “related to” embraces state laws\n “having a connection with or reference to” carrier “ ‘rates, routes, or\n services,’ ” whether directly or indirectly. Ibid. At the same time, the\n breadth of the words “related to” does not mean that the preemption\n clause should be read with an “uncritical literalism.” New York State\n Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\n 514 U. S. 645, 655–656. The Court has cautioned that §14501(c)(1)\n does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and ser-\n vices “in only a ‘tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner.’ ” Rowe,\n 552 U. S., at 371. Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Pelkey’s state-law claims escape preemption because they are\n “related to” neither the “transportation of property” nor the “service”\n of a motor carrier. Although §14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA’s\n air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation’s one con-\n spicuous alteration—addition of the words “with respect to the trans-\n portation of property”—significantly limits the FAAAA’s preemptive\n scope. It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the “price, route,\n or service” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also con-\n cern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.” Title 49 defines\n “transportation,” in relevant part, as “services related to th[e] move-\n ment” of property, “including arranging for . . . storage [and] han-\n dling.” §13102(23)(B). Pelkey’s Consumer Protection Act and negli-\n gence claims are not “related to th[e] movement” of his car. Chapter\n 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation—\n here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct\n occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored. Dan’s City\n maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s definition of “transportation”\n includes “storage” and “handling,” Pelkey’s claims fall within\n §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive ambit. But “storage” and “handling” fit\n within §13102(23)(B)’s definition only when those services “relat[e] to\n th[e] movement” of property. Thus temporary storage of an item in\n transit en route to its final destination qualifies as “transportation,”\n but permanent storage does not. Here, no storage occurred in the\n course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.\n    Pelkey’s claims are also unrelated to a “service” a motor carrier\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  renders its customers. The transportation service Dan’s City pro-\n  vided—removal of Pelkey’s car from his landlord’s parking lot—did\n  involve the movement of property, but that service ended months be-\n  fore the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based. Because chapter\n  262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses “storage compan[ies]” and\n  “garage owner[s] or keeper[s],” not transportation activities, it has\n  neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services\n  a motor carrier offers its customers. See Rowe, 552 U. S., at 371.\n     The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed\n  vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress’ purpose in\n  enacting §14501(c)(1), which was to displace “a State’s direct substi-\n  tution of its own governmental commands for ‘competitive market\n  forces’ in determining . . . the services that motor carriers will pro-\n  vide.” Id., at 372. The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes\n  hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a\n  motor carrier to offer services not available in the market. Nor do\n  they “freez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\n  tinue in the future.” Ibid. Pp. 8–11.\n     (c) Dan’s City’s additional arguments in favor of preemption are not\n  persuasive. Dan’s City contends that because none of Pelkey’s claims\n  fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U. S. C.\n  §§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted. But excep-\n  tions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in them-\n  selves delineate the scope of the rule. Here, the exceptions identify\n  matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded\n  from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n     Dan’s City also maintains that Pelkey’s claims are “related to” its\n  towing service because selling Pelkey’s car was the means by which\n  Dan’s City obtained payment for the tow. If such state-law claims\n  were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-\n  based dispute arising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle\n  previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal. No such\n  design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See Silkwood v.\n  Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251. Pp. 11–13.\n163 N.

ROBERT PELKEY\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF\n\n                    NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n                                [May 13, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the preemptive scope of a provision\nof the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act\nof 1994 (FAAAA or Act) applicable to motor carriers. Codi-\nfied at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1), the provision reads:\n    “[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regula-\n    tion, or other provision having the force and effect of\n    law related to a price, route, or service of any motor\n    carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of\n    property.”\nPlaintiff-respondent Robert Pelkey brought suit under\nNew Hampshire law against defendant-petitioner Dan’s\nCity Used Cars (Dan’s City), a towing company. Pelkey al-\nleged that Dan’s City took custody of his car after towing\nit without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to notify him of its\nplan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkey’s\ncommunication that he wanted to arrange for the car’s\nreturn, and eventually traded the car away without com-\npensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.\n   Disposal of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company”\nis regulated by chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised\n2          DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStatutes Annotated. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to\n262:40–c (West 2004 and 2012 West Cum. Supp.). Dan’s\nCity relied on those laws to dispose of Pelkey’s vehicle\nfor nonpayment of towing and storage fees. According to\nPelkey, however, Dan’s City failed to comply with New\nHampshire’s provisions governing the sale of stored vehi-\ncles and the application of sale proceeds. Pelkey charged\nthat Dan’s City’s disposal of his car without following the\nrequirements contained in chapter 262 violated the New\nHampshire Consumer Protection Act, §358–A:2 (West\n2009), as well as Dan’s City’s statutory and common-law\nduties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in pos-\nsession of a bailor’s property.\n  We hold, in accord with the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt, that state-law claims stemming from the storage\nand disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not\nsufficiently connected to a motor carrier’s service with\nrespect to the transportation of property to warrant pre-\nemption under §14501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in\npoint regulates no towing services, no carriage of prop-\nerty. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles\nseeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State’s\nregulation of that activity by any federal prescription.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 92 Stat.\n1705, largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.\nIn keeping with the statute’s aim to achieve “maximum\nreliance on competitive market forces,” id., at 1706, Con-\ngress sought to “ensure that the States would not undo\nfederal deregulation with regulation of their own.” Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378\n(1992). Congress therefore included a preemption provi-\nsion, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §41713(b)(1), prohibiting\nStates from enacting or enforcing any law “related to a\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprice, route, or service of an air carrier.”\n    Two years later, the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 94\nStat. 793, extended deregulation to the trucking industry.\nCongress completed the deregulation 14 years thereafter,\nin 1994, by expressly preempting state trucking regula-\ntion. Congress did so upon finding that state governance\nof intrastate transportation of property had become “un-\nreasonably burden[some]” to “free trade, interstate com-\nmerce, and American consumers.” Columbus v. Ours Ga-\nrage & Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002)\n(citing FAAAA §601(a)(1), 108 Stat. 1605). Borrowing\nfrom the ADA’s preemption clause, but adding a new\nqualification, §601(c) of the FAAAA supersedes state laws\n“related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier\n. . . with respect to the transportation of property.” 108\nStat. 1606, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1) (em-\nphasis added).1 The Act exempts certain measures from\nits preemptive scope, including state laws regulating\nmotor vehicle safety, size, and weight; motor carrier in-\nsurance; and the intrastate transportation of household\ngoods. §§14501(c)(2)(A)–(B). Also exempted from preemp-\ntion are state laws “relating to the price” of “vehicle trans-\nportation by a tow truck,” if towing occurs without prior\nconsent of the vehicle owner. §14501(c)(2)(C).\n    This case involves the interaction between the FAAAA’s\npreemption clause and the State of New Hampshire’s\nregulation of the removal, storage, and disposal of aban-\ndoned motor vehicles. Chapter 262 of the New Hampshire\nRevised Statutes Annotated establishes procedures by\n——————\n   1 The term “motor carrier” is defined as “a person providing motor\n\nvehicle transportation for compensation.” 49 U. S. C. §13102(14) (2006\ned., Supp. V). We have previously recognized that tow trucks qualify\nas “motor carriers” under §14501(c)(1). Columbus v. Ours Garage &\nWrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 430 (2002). Dan’s City’s qualifica-\ntion as a motor carrier under the FAAAA is uncontested by the parties.\nSee Brief for Petitioner i; Brief for Respondent 18.\n4           DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich an “authorized official” or the “owner . . . of any\nprivate property . . . on which a vehicle is parked without\npermission” may arrange to have the vehicle towed and\nstored. N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to 262:34, 262:40–\na(I). It generally makes the owner of a towed vehicle\nresponsible for reasonable removal and storage fees. See\n§262:33(I) (reasonable removal and storage charges “shall\nbe a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the\nowner”); §262:33(II) (owner entitled to recover vehicle\nafter “payment of all reasonable towing and storage\ncharges”); §262:40–a(II) (owner of a vehicle towed from a\nparking lot or parking garage is responsible for “removal\nand storage charges” when the lot or garage conspicuously\nposts notice of parking restrictions).\n  Under chapter 262, the custodian of a car that remains\nunclaimed for 30 days following a tow may dispose of the\nvehicle upon compliance with notice requirements.\n§§262:36–a(I), (II). A “garage owner or keeper” must post\nnotices of an impending sale in public places and provide\nmail notice to the vehicle owner whenever the owner’s\naddress may “be ascertained . . . by the exercise of reason-\nable diligence.” §262:38. If a towed vehicle is not fit\nfor legal use, its custodian need not provide individual\nor public notice prior to disposal, and sale of the vehicle\nmay occur upon written notice to and approval from\nNew Hampshire’s Department of Public Safety. §262:36–\na(III).2\n  On compliance with the statutory requirements, the\ncustodian of a stored vehicle may sell the vehicle by public\nauction at its place of business. §262:37. The storage\ncompany may use the sale proceeds to pay “the amount\nof the liens and the reasonable expenses incident to the\n——————\n  2 Section 262:36–a has been amended since April 2007, when Dan’s\n\nCity’s alleged misconduct occurred.

Remaining proceeds are\npayable “to the [vehicle’s] owner . . . if claimed at any time\nwithin one year from the date of sale.” Ibid.\n                              B\n   The landlord of the apartment complex in which Pelkey\nlived required tenants to remove their cars from the park-\ning lot in the event of a snowstorm, so that the snow could\nbe cleared. Pelkey’s 2004 Honda Civic remained in the\nlot during and after a February 2007 snowstorm. At the\nlandlord’s request, Dan’s City towed and stored the vehi-\ncle. Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,\nPelkey did not know his car had been towed. Soon after\nremoval of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for\na procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he\nsuffered a heart attack. He remained under hospital care\nuntil his discharge on April 9, 2007.\n   Unaware of Pelkey’s identity or illness, Dan’s City\nsought permission from New Hampshire’s Department of\nPublic Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.\nIn response, the department identified Pelkey as the last\nknown owner of the vehicle. Dan’s City wrote to Pelkey,\nnotifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.\nWhen the post office returned the letter, checking the box\n“moved, left no address,” Dan’s City scheduled an auction\nfor April 19. Meanwhile, in the days following Pelkey’s\ndischarge from the hospital, his attorney learned from\ncounsel for the apartment complex that the car had been\ntowed by Dan’s City and was scheduled to be sold at pub-\nlic auction. On April 17, Pelkey’s attorney informed\nDan’s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and\nreclaim his vehicle. Dan’s City nevertheless proceeded\nwith the auction. Attracting no bidders, Dan’s City later\ndisposed of the car by trading it to a third party. Pelkey\nwas not notified in advance of the trade, and has received\nno proceeds from the sale.\n6            DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Pelkey brought suit against Dan’s City in New Hamp-\nshire Superior Court. He alleged that Dan’s City violated\nthe New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, N. H.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §358–A:2, by failing to comply with chap-\nter 262’s requirements for disposal of stored vehicles, mak-\ning false statements about the condition and value of his\nHonda, and proceeding with the auction despite notice\nthat Pelkey wanted to reclaim the car.3 He also alleged\nthat Dan’s City negligently breached both statutory and\ncommon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care in\ndisposing of the car. Granting summary judgment to\nDan’s City, the New Hampshire Superior Court concluded\nthat Pelkey’s claims were preempted by the FAAAA.\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held\nthe FAAAA’s preemption clause, 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1),\ninapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to Dan’s\nCity’s conduct in disposing of his Honda post-storage, not\nto conduct concerning “the transportation of property.”\n163 N. H. 483, 490–493, 44 A. 3d 480, 487–489 (2012)\n(emphasis deleted). Alternatively, the court ruled that,\neven if Pelkey’s claims could be said to concern the trans-\nportation of property, they did not “sufficiently relat[e] to a\ntowing company’s ‘service’ to be preempted.” Id., at 493,\n44 A. 3d, at 490.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in\nstate supreme courts on whether 49 U.

N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §358–A:2 (West 2009). It authorizes a\nprivate claim for damages and equitable relief; for a willful or knowing\nviolation, the Act allows the plaintiff to recover “as much as 3 times,\nbut not less than 2 times,” actual damages. §358–A:10(I) (2012 West\nCum.

See also id., at 383 (“ordinary meaning of\n. . . words [‘related to’] is a broad one,” thus ADA’s use of\nthose words “expresses a broad pre-emptive purpose”).\n    At the same time, the breadth of the words “related to”\ndoes not mean the sky is the limit. We have refused to\nread the preemption clause of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S.

And we have cautioned\nthat §14501(c)(1) does not preempt state laws affecting\ncarrier prices, routes, and services “in only a ‘tenuous,\nremote, or peripheral . . . manner.’ ” Rowe, 552 U. S., at\n371 (quoting Morales, 504 U. S., at 390).\n                               B\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that\nPelkey’s state-law claims are “related to” neither the\n“transportation of property” nor the “service” of a motor\ncarrier. We agree.\n  Pelkey’s claims escape preemption, we hold, because\nthey are not “related to” the service of a motor carrier\n“with respect to the transportation of property.”\n§14501(c)(1). Although §14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the\nADA’s air-carrier preemption provision, see Rowe, 552\nU. S., at 370, the FAAAA formulation contains one con-\nspicuous alteration—the addition of the words “with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.” That phrase\n“massively limits the scope of preemption” ordered by the\nFAAAA. Ours Garage, 536 U. S., at 449 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting).4 As the New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly\nunderstood, for purposes of FAAAA preemption, it is not\nsufficient that a state law relates to the “price, route, or\nservice” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must\nalso concern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.”\nSee 163 N. H., at 490, 44 A. 3d, at 487.\n  Title 49 defines “transportation,” in relevant part, as\n“services related to th[e] movement” of property, “includ-\ning arranging for, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in\ntransit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation, storage, handling,\n——————\n  4 Although this statement appears in the Ours Garage dissent, noth-\n\ning in the Court’s opinion in that case is in any way inconsistent with\nthe dissent’s characterization of §14501(c)(1).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Pelkey’s Consumer Protection\nAct and negligence claims are not “related to th[e] move-\nment” of his car. Ibid. (emphasis added). He charges\nDan’s City with failure to comply with chapter 262 and\nneglect of its statutory and common-law duties of care as\na bailee of his stored vehicle. Chapter 262 does not limit\nwhen, where, or how tow trucks may be operated. The\nChapter regulates, instead, the disposal of vehicles once\ntheir transportation—here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey\ndoes not object to the manner in which his car was moved\nor the price of the tow; he seeks redress only for conduct\nsubsequent to “transportation,” conduct occurring after\nthe car ceased moving and was stored.\n   Dan’s City maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s\ndefinition of “transportation” includes “storage” and “han-\ndling,” Pelkey’s claims, which do concern the storage and\nhandling of his car, fall within §14501(c)(1)’s preemp-\ntive ambit. Dan’s City overlooks, however, that under\n§13102(23)(B), services such as “storage” and “handling”\nfit within the definition of “transportation” only when\nthose services “relat[e] to th[e] movement” of property.\nTemporary storage of an item in transit en route to its\nfinal destination relates to the movement of property and\ntherefore fits within §13102(23)(B)’s definition. But prop-\nerty stored after delivery is no longer in transit. Cf. 49\nCFR §375.609 (2012) (distinguishing between “storage-in-\ntransit” and “permanent storage” (regulation of Federal\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration)). Here, no storage\noccurred in the course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.\nDan’s City’s storage of Pelkey’s car after the towing job\nwas done, in short, does not involve “transportation” with-\nin the meaning of the federal Act.\n   Pelkey’s claims also survive preemption under\n§14501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a “service” a\nmotor carrier renders its customers. The transportation\n10           DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nservice Dan’s City provided was the removal of Pelkey’s\ncar from his landlord’s parking lot. That service, which\ndid involve the movement of property, ended months\nbefore the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based.\nHis claims rely on New Hampshire’s abandoned vehicle\ndisposal regime, prescribed in chapter 262, for the rules\ngoverning Dan’s City’s conduct.5 Chapter 262 addresses\n“storage compan[ies]” and “garage owner[s] or keeper[s],”\nnot transportation activities.       See N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§262:36–a, 262:38. Unlike Maine’s tobacco delivery\nregulations at issue in Rowe, chapter 262 has neither a\ndirect nor an indirect connection to any transportation\nservices a motor carrier offers its customers. See 552\nU. S., at 371. We need not venture an all-purposes defini-\ntion of transportation “service[s]” in order to conclude that\nstate-law claims homing in on the disposal of stored vehi-\ncles fall outside §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive compass.\n   Our conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal\nof towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord\nwith Congress’ purpose in enacting §14501(c)(1). Concerned\nthat state regulation “impeded the free flow of trade,\ntraffic, and transportation of interstate commerce,” Con-\ngress resolved to displace “certain aspects of the State\nregulatory process.” FAAAA §601(a), 108 Stat. 1605 (em-\nphasis added). The target at which it aimed was “a State’s\ndirect substitution of its own governmental commands for\ncompetitive market forces in determining (to a signifi-\ncant degree) the services that motor carriers will pro-\nvide.” Rowe, 552 U. S., at 372 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Pelkey’s claims are far removed from Congress’ driving\n——————\n  5 The parties dispute whether, as Pelkey alleges, conduct that violates\n\nchapter 262 may qualify as an unfair or deceptive act or practice\nproscribed by New Hampshire’s Consumer Protection Act. This dispute\nturns on interpretation of state law, a matter on which we express no\nopinion.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

He sued under state consumer protection and\ntort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful\ndisposal of his vehicle. The state laws in question hardly\nconstrain participation in interstate commerce by requir-\ning a motor carrier to offer services not available in the\nmarket. Nor do the state laws invoked by Pelkey “freez[e]\ninto place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\ntinue in the future.” Ibid. New Hampshire’s laws on dis-\nposal of stored vehicles, moreover, will not open the way for\n“a patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and\nregulations.” Id., at 373. As Dan’s City concedes, aban-\ndoned vehicle laws like chapter 262 “do not hamper the\noperations of tow truckers” and “are not the kind of bur-\ndensome state economic regulation Congress sought to\npreempt.” Reply Brief 21.\n                              C\n   Dan’s City advances two further arguments in favor of\npreemption. First, Dan’s City contends that Congress’\nenumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49\nU. S. C. §§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regula-\ntion of motor carriers only when the State’s law comes\nwithin a specified exception. Because Pelkey’s claims do\nnot fit within any exception to preemption, Dan’s City\nurges, those claims must be preempted. This argument\nexceeds sensible bounds. Exceptions to a general rule,\nwhile sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in\nthemselves delineate the scope of the rule. The exceptions\nto §14501(c)(1)’s general rule of preemption identify mat-\nters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be\nprecluded from doing so, but they do not control more than\nthat.\n   An example may clarify the point. Section 14501(c) does\nnot exempt zoning regulations. Such laws, however, “are\npeculiarly within the province of state and local legislative\nauthorities.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508, n. 18\n12            DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1975). It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation\nof the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls\noutside the preemptive sweep of §14501(c)(1). That is so\nbecause zoning ordinances ordinarily are not “related to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.” §14501(c)(1). The\nsame is true of New Hampshire’s regulation of the dis-\nposal of stored vehicles.\n   Dan’s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.\nPelkey’s claims, Dan’s City maintains, are “related to” the\ntowing service it rendered because selling Pelkey’s car was\nthe means by which Dan’s City obtained payment for the\ntow. But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law\nwould govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute\narising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle\npreviously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.\nFederal law does not speak to these issues.6 Thus, not\nonly would the preemption urged by Dan’s City leave\nvehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would\neliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing com-\npany’s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed. No\nsuch design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See\nSilkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984)\n(“It is difficult to believe that Congress would, without\ncomment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those\ninjured by illegal conduct.”).\n   In sum, Dan’s City cannot have it both ways. It cannot\nrely on New Hampshire’s regulatory framework as author-\nization for the sale of Pelkey’s car, yet argue that Pelkey’s\nclaims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.\n——————\n   6 There is an exception to Congress’ silence, but it is of no aid to Dan’s\n\nCity: The Act spares from preemption laws “relating to the price of for-\nhire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation\nis performed [as it was here] without the prior consent or authorization\nof the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.”                  49 U.

Argued March 20, 2013—Decided May 13, 2013\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n  (FAAAA) preempts state laws “related to a price, route, or service of\n  any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.”\n  49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1). This provision borrows from the Airline De-\n  regulation Act of 1978 (ADA), which preempts state laws “related to a\n  price, route, or service of an air carrier,” §41713(b)(1), but it adds the\n  important qualification, “with respect to transportation of property.”\n     Plaintiff-respondent Pelkey brought suit in New Hampshire Supe-\n  rior Court, alleging that defendant-petitioner Dan’s City Used Cars\n  (Dan’s City), a towing company, took custody of his car after towing it\n  from his landlord’s parking lot without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to\n  notify him of its plan to auction the car, held an auction despite\n  Pelkey’s notice that he wanted to reclaim the car, and eventually\n  traded the car away without compensating Pelkey for the loss of his\n  vehicle. In disposing of his car, Pelkey further alleged, Dan’s City did\n  not meet the requirements contained in chapter 262 of the New\n  Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, which regulates the disposal\n  of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company.” Dan’s City’s miscon-\n  duct, Pelkey charged, both violated New Hampshire’s Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act and breached the towing company’s statutory and com-\n  mon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care while in possession\n  of a bailor’s property. The court granted summary judgment to Dan’s\n  City, concluding that the FAAAA preempted Pelkey’s claims. The\n  New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held the FAAAA’s\n  preemption clause inapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to\n  Dan’s City’s conduct in disposing of his car post-storage, not to con-\n  duct concerning “the transportation of property,” or a towing com-\n  pany’s “service.”\n2             DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: Section 14501(c)(1) does not preempt state-law claims stemming\n from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Pp. 7–13.\n    (a) Where Congress has superseded state legislation by statute,\n this Court’s task is to “identify the domain expressly pre-empted,”\n Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 541, focusing first on\n the statutory language, CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S.\n 658, 664. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S.\n 364, 370, this Court’s reading of §14501(c)(1) was informed by deci-\n sions interpreting parallel language in the ADA’s preemption clause.\n Thus, the Court held, the phrase “related to” embraces state laws\n “having a connection with or reference to” carrier “ ‘rates, routes, or\n services,’ ” whether directly or indirectly. Ibid. At the same time, the\n breadth of the words “related to” does not mean that the preemption\n clause should be read with an “uncritical literalism.” New York State\n Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,\n 514 U. S. 645, 655–656. The Court has cautioned that §14501(c)(1)\n does not preempt state laws affecting carrier prices, routes, and ser-\n vices “in only a ‘tenuous, remote, or peripheral . . . manner.’ ” Rowe,\n 552 U. S., at 371. Pp. 7–8.\n    (b) Pelkey’s state-law claims escape preemption because they are\n “related to” neither the “transportation of property” nor the “service”\n of a motor carrier. Although §14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the ADA’s\n air-carrier preemption provision, the FAAAA formulation’s one con-\n spicuous alteration—addition of the words “with respect to the trans-\n portation of property”—significantly limits the FAAAA’s preemptive\n scope. It is not sufficient for a state law to relate to the “price, route,\n or service” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must also con-\n cern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.” Title 49 defines\n “transportation,” in relevant part, as “services related to th[e] move-\n ment” of property, “including arranging for . . . storage [and] han-\n dling.” §13102(23)(B). Pelkey’s Consumer Protection Act and negli-\n gence claims are not “related to th[e] movement” of his car. Chapter\n 262 regulates the disposal of vehicles once their transportation—\n here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey seeks redress only for conduct\n occurring after the car ceased moving and was stored. Dan’s City\n maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s definition of “transportation”\n includes “storage” and “handling,” Pelkey’s claims fall within\n §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive ambit. But “storage” and “handling” fit\n within §13102(23)(B)’s definition only when those services “relat[e] to\n th[e] movement” of property. Thus temporary storage of an item in\n transit en route to its final destination qualifies as “transportation,”\n but permanent storage does not. Here, no storage occurred in the\n course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.\n    Pelkey’s claims are also unrelated to a “service” a motor carrier\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  renders its customers. The transportation service Dan’s City pro-\n  vided—removal of Pelkey’s car from his landlord’s parking lot—did\n  involve the movement of property, but that service ended months be-\n  fore the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based. Because chapter\n  262, on which Pelkey relies, addresses “storage compan[ies]” and\n  “garage owner[s] or keeper[s],” not transportation activities, it has\n  neither a direct nor an indirect connection to transportation services\n  a motor carrier offers its customers. See Rowe, 552 U. S., at 371.\n     The conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal of towed\n  vehicles are not preempted is in full accord with Congress’ purpose in\n  enacting §14501(c)(1), which was to displace “a State’s direct substi-\n  tution of its own governmental commands for ‘competitive market\n  forces’ in determining . . . the services that motor carriers will pro-\n  vide.” Id., at 372. The New Hampshire prescriptions Pelkey invokes\n  hardly constrain participation in interstate commerce by requiring a\n  motor carrier to offer services not available in the market. Nor do\n  they “freez[e] into place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\n  tinue in the future.” Ibid. Pp. 8–11.\n     (c) Dan’s City’s additional arguments in favor of preemption are not\n  persuasive. Dan’s City contends that because none of Pelkey’s claims\n  fit within the exceptions to preemption detailed in 49 U. S. C.\n  §§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), his claims must be preempted. But excep-\n  tions, while sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in them-\n  selves delineate the scope of the rule. Here, the exceptions identify\n  matters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be precluded\n  from doing so, but they do not control more than that.\n     Dan’s City also maintains that Pelkey’s claims are “related to” its\n  towing service because selling Pelkey’s car was the means by which\n  Dan’s City obtained payment for the tow. If such state-law claims\n  were preempted, no law would govern resolution of a non-contract-\n  based dispute arising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle\n  previously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal. No such\n  design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See Silkwood v.\n  Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251. Pp. 11–13.\n163 N.

Codi-\nfied at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1), the provision reads:\n    “[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regula-\n    tion, or other provision having the force and effect of\n    law related to a price, route, or service of any motor\n    carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of\n    property.”\nPlaintiff-respondent Robert Pelkey brought suit under\nNew Hampshire law against defendant-petitioner Dan’s\nCity Used Cars (Dan’s City), a towing company. Pelkey al-\nleged that Dan’s City took custody of his car after towing\nit without Pelkey’s knowledge, failed to notify him of its\nplan to auction the car, held an auction despite Pelkey’s\ncommunication that he wanted to arrange for the car’s\nreturn, and eventually traded the car away without com-\npensating Pelkey for the loss of his vehicle.\n   Disposal of abandoned vehicles by a “storage company”\nis regulated by chapter 262 of the New Hampshire Revised\n2          DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStatutes Annotated. See N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to\n262:40–c (West 2004 and 2012 West Cum. Supp.). Dan’s\nCity relied on those laws to dispose of Pelkey’s vehicle\nfor nonpayment of towing and storage fees. According to\nPelkey, however, Dan’s City failed to comply with New\nHampshire’s provisions governing the sale of stored vehi-\ncles and the application of sale proceeds. Pelkey charged\nthat Dan’s City’s disposal of his car without following the\nrequirements contained in chapter 262 violated the New\nHampshire Consumer Protection Act, §358–A:2 (West\n2009), as well as Dan’s City’s statutory and common-law\nduties as bailee to exercise reasonable care while in pos-\nsession of a bailor’s property.\n  We hold, in accord with the New Hampshire Supreme\nCourt, that state-law claims stemming from the storage\nand disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not\nsufficiently connected to a motor carrier’s service with\nrespect to the transportation of property to warrant pre-\nemption under §14501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in\npoint regulates no towing services, no carriage of prop-\nerty. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles\nseeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State’s\nregulation of that activity by any federal prescription.\n                             I\n\n                            A\n\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 92 Stat.\n1705, largely deregulated the domestic airline industry.\nIn keeping with the statute’s aim to achieve “maximum\nreliance on competitive market forces,” id., at 1706, Con-\ngress sought to “ensure that the States would not undo\nfederal deregulation with regulation of their own.” Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 378\n(1992). Congress therefore included a preemption provi-\nsion, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §41713(b)(1), prohibiting\nStates from enacting or enforcing any law “related to a\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Congress did so upon finding that state governance\nof intrastate transportation of property had become “un-\nreasonably burden[some]” to “free trade, interstate com-\nmerce, and American consumers.” Columbus v. Ours Ga-\nrage & Wrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 440 (2002)\n(citing FAAAA §601(a)(1), 108 Stat. 1605). Borrowing\nfrom the ADA’s preemption clause, but adding a new\nqualification, §601(c) of the FAAAA supersedes state laws\n“related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier\n. . . with respect to the transportation of property.” 108\nStat. 1606, now codified at 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1) (em-\nphasis added).1 The Act exempts certain measures from\nits preemptive scope, including state laws regulating\nmotor vehicle safety, size, and weight; motor carrier in-\nsurance; and the intrastate transportation of household\ngoods. §§14501(c)(2)(A)–(B). Also exempted from preemp-\ntion are state laws “relating to the price” of “vehicle trans-\nportation by a tow truck,” if towing occurs without prior\nconsent of the vehicle owner. §14501(c)(2)(C).\n    This case involves the interaction between the FAAAA’s\npreemption clause and the State of New Hampshire’s\nregulation of the removal, storage, and disposal of aban-\ndoned motor vehicles. Chapter 262 of the New Hampshire\nRevised Statutes Annotated establishes procedures by\n——————\n   1 The term “motor carrier” is defined as “a person providing motor\n\nvehicle transportation for compensation.” 49 U. S. C. §13102(14) (2006\ned., Supp. V). We have previously recognized that tow trucks qualify\nas “motor carriers” under §14501(c)(1). Columbus v. Ours Garage &\nWrecker Service, Inc., 536 U. S. 424, 430 (2002). Dan’s City’s qualifica-\ntion as a motor carrier under the FAAAA is uncontested by the parties.\nSee Brief for Petitioner i; Brief for Respondent 18.\n4           DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v.

N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§262:31 to 262:34, 262:40–\na(I). It generally makes the owner of a towed vehicle\nresponsible for reasonable removal and storage fees. See\n§262:33(I) (reasonable removal and storage charges “shall\nbe a lien against the vehicle which shall be paid by the\nowner”); §262:33(II) (owner entitled to recover vehicle\nafter “payment of all reasonable towing and storage\ncharges”); §262:40–a(II) (owner of a vehicle towed from a\nparking lot or parking garage is responsible for “removal\nand storage charges” when the lot or garage conspicuously\nposts notice of parking restrictions).\n  Under chapter 262, the custodian of a car that remains\nunclaimed for 30 days following a tow may dispose of the\nvehicle upon compliance with notice requirements.\n§§262:36–a(I), (II). A “garage owner or keeper” must post\nnotices of an impending sale in public places and provide\nmail notice to the vehicle owner whenever the owner’s\naddress may “be ascertained . . . by the exercise of reason-\nable diligence.” §262:38. If a towed vehicle is not fit\nfor legal use, its custodian need not provide individual\nor public notice prior to disposal, and sale of the vehicle\nmay occur upon written notice to and approval from\nNew Hampshire’s Department of Public Safety. §262:36–\na(III).2\n  On compliance with the statutory requirements, the\ncustodian of a stored vehicle may sell the vehicle by public\nauction at its place of business. §262:37.

Remaining proceeds are\npayable “to the [vehicle’s] owner . . . if claimed at any time\nwithin one year from the date of sale.” Ibid.\n                              B\n   The landlord of the apartment complex in which Pelkey\nlived required tenants to remove their cars from the park-\ning lot in the event of a snowstorm, so that the snow could\nbe cleared. Pelkey’s 2004 Honda Civic remained in the\nlot during and after a February 2007 snowstorm. At the\nlandlord’s request, Dan’s City towed and stored the vehi-\ncle. Confined to his bed with a serious medical condition,\nPelkey did not know his car had been towed. Soon after\nremoval of his car, Pelkey was admitted to the hospital for\na procedure to amputate his left foot, during which he\nsuffered a heart attack. He remained under hospital care\nuntil his discharge on April 9, 2007.\n   Unaware of Pelkey’s identity or illness, Dan’s City\nsought permission from New Hampshire’s Department of\nPublic Safety to sell the Honda at auction without notice.\nIn response, the department identified Pelkey as the last\nknown owner of the vehicle. Dan’s City wrote to Pelkey,\nnotifying him that it had towed and was storing his car.\nWhen the post office returned the letter, checking the box\n“moved, left no address,” Dan’s City scheduled an auction\nfor April 19. Meanwhile, in the days following Pelkey’s\ndischarge from the hospital, his attorney learned from\ncounsel for the apartment complex that the car had been\ntowed by Dan’s City and was scheduled to be sold at pub-\nlic auction. On April 17, Pelkey’s attorney informed\nDan’s City that Pelkey wanted to pay any charges owed and\nreclaim his vehicle. Dan’s City nevertheless proceeded\nwith the auction. Attracting no bidders, Dan’s City later\ndisposed of the car by trading it to a third party. Pelkey\nwas not notified in advance of the trade, and has received\nno proceeds from the sale.\n6            DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Pelkey brought suit against Dan’s City in New Hamp-\nshire Superior Court. He alleged that Dan’s City violated\nthe New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act, N. H.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §358–A:2, by failing to comply with chap-\nter 262’s requirements for disposal of stored vehicles, mak-\ning false statements about the condition and value of his\nHonda, and proceeding with the auction despite notice\nthat Pelkey wanted to reclaim the car.3 He also alleged\nthat Dan’s City negligently breached both statutory and\ncommon-law duties as a bailee to use reasonable care in\ndisposing of the car. Granting summary judgment to\nDan’s City, the New Hampshire Superior Court concluded\nthat Pelkey’s claims were preempted by the FAAAA.\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed. It held\nthe FAAAA’s preemption clause, 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1),\ninapplicable because Pelkey’s claims related to Dan’s\nCity’s conduct in disposing of his Honda post-storage, not\nto conduct concerning “the transportation of property.”\n163 N. H. 483, 490–493, 44 A. 3d 480, 487–489 (2012)\n(emphasis deleted). Alternatively, the court ruled that,\neven if Pelkey’s claims could be said to concern the trans-\nportation of property, they did not “sufficiently relat[e] to a\ntowing company’s ‘service’ to be preempted.” Id., at 493,\n44 A. 3d, at 490.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a division of opinion in\nstate supreme courts on whether 49 U.

Reilly, 533\nU. S. 525, 541 (2001). To do so, we focus first on the\nstatutory language, “which necessarily contains the best\nevidence of Congress’ pre-emptive intent.” CSX Transp.,\nInc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993).\n    The FAAAA’s preemption clause prohibits enforcement\nof state laws “related to a price, route, or service of any\nmotor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of\nproperty.” 49 U. S. C. §14501(c)(1). In Rowe v. New\nHampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 370 (2008),\nour reading of this language was informed by decisions\ninterpreting the parallel language in the ADA’s preemp-\ntion clause. The phrase “related to,” we said, embraces\nstate laws “having a connection with or reference to”\ncarrier “ ‘rates, routes, or services,’ ” whether directly or\nindirectly. Ibid. (quoting Morales, 504 U. S., at 384; em-\nphasis deleted). See also id., at 383 (“ordinary meaning of\n. . . words [‘related to’] is a broad one,” thus ADA’s use of\nthose words “expresses a broad pre-emptive purpose”).\n    At the same time, the breadth of the words “related to”\ndoes not mean the sky is the limit. We have refused to\nread the preemption clause of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S. C. §1144(a), which\nsupersedes state laws “relate[d] to any employee benefit\nplan,” with an “uncritical literalism,” else “for all practical\npurposes pre-emption would never run its course.” New\n8            DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v.

S. 645, 655–656 (1995) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). And we have cautioned\nthat §14501(c)(1) does not preempt state laws affecting\ncarrier prices, routes, and services “in only a ‘tenuous,\nremote, or peripheral . . . manner.’ ” Rowe, 552 U. S., at\n371 (quoting Morales, 504 U. S., at 390).\n                               B\n  The New Hampshire Supreme Court concluded that\nPelkey’s state-law claims are “related to” neither the\n“transportation of property” nor the “service” of a motor\ncarrier. We agree.\n  Pelkey’s claims escape preemption, we hold, because\nthey are not “related to” the service of a motor carrier\n“with respect to the transportation of property.”\n§14501(c)(1). Although §14501(c)(1) otherwise tracks the\nADA’s air-carrier preemption provision, see Rowe, 552\nU. S., at 370, the FAAAA formulation contains one con-\nspicuous alteration—the addition of the words “with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.” That phrase\n“massively limits the scope of preemption” ordered by the\nFAAAA. Ours Garage, 536 U. S., at 449 (SCALIA, J., dis-\nsenting).4 As the New Hampshire Supreme Court correctly\nunderstood, for purposes of FAAAA preemption, it is not\nsufficient that a state law relates to the “price, route, or\nservice” of a motor carrier in any capacity; the law must\nalso concern a motor carrier’s “transportation of property.”\nSee 163 N. H., at 490, 44 A. 3d, at 487.\n  Title 49 defines “transportation,” in relevant part, as\n“services related to th[e] movement” of property, “includ-\ning arranging for, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in\ntransit, refrigeration, icing, ventilation, storage, handling,\n——————\n  4 Although this statement appears in the Ours Garage dissent, noth-\n\ning in the Court’s opinion in that case is in any way inconsistent with\nthe dissent’s characterization of §14501(c)(1).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Pelkey’s Consumer Protection\nAct and negligence claims are not “related to th[e] move-\nment” of his car. Ibid. (emphasis added). He charges\nDan’s City with failure to comply with chapter 262 and\nneglect of its statutory and common-law duties of care as\na bailee of his stored vehicle. Chapter 262 does not limit\nwhen, where, or how tow trucks may be operated. The\nChapter regulates, instead, the disposal of vehicles once\ntheir transportation—here, by towing—has ended. Pelkey\ndoes not object to the manner in which his car was moved\nor the price of the tow; he seeks redress only for conduct\nsubsequent to “transportation,” conduct occurring after\nthe car ceased moving and was stored.\n   Dan’s City maintains that because §13102(23)(B)’s\ndefinition of “transportation” includes “storage” and “han-\ndling,” Pelkey’s claims, which do concern the storage and\nhandling of his car, fall within §14501(c)(1)’s preemp-\ntive ambit. Dan’s City overlooks, however, that under\n§13102(23)(B), services such as “storage” and “handling”\nfit within the definition of “transportation” only when\nthose services “relat[e] to th[e] movement” of property.\nTemporary storage of an item in transit en route to its\nfinal destination relates to the movement of property and\ntherefore fits within §13102(23)(B)’s definition. But prop-\nerty stored after delivery is no longer in transit. Cf. 49\nCFR §375.609 (2012) (distinguishing between “storage-in-\ntransit” and “permanent storage” (regulation of Federal\nMotor Carrier Safety Administration)). Here, no storage\noccurred in the course of transporting Pelkey’s vehicle.\nDan’s City’s storage of Pelkey’s car after the towing job\nwas done, in short, does not involve “transportation” with-\nin the meaning of the federal Act.\n   Pelkey’s claims also survive preemption under\n§14501(c)(1) because they are unrelated to a “service” a\nmotor carrier renders its customers. The transportation\n10           DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nservice Dan’s City provided was the removal of Pelkey’s\ncar from his landlord’s parking lot. That service, which\ndid involve the movement of property, ended months\nbefore the conduct on which Pelkey’s claims are based.\nHis claims rely on New Hampshire’s abandoned vehicle\ndisposal regime, prescribed in chapter 262, for the rules\ngoverning Dan’s City’s conduct.5 Chapter 262 addresses\n“storage compan[ies]” and “garage owner[s] or keeper[s],”\nnot transportation activities.       See N. H. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. §§262:36–a, 262:38. Unlike Maine’s tobacco delivery\nregulations at issue in Rowe, chapter 262 has neither a\ndirect nor an indirect connection to any transportation\nservices a motor carrier offers its customers. See 552\nU. S., at 371. We need not venture an all-purposes defini-\ntion of transportation “service[s]” in order to conclude that\nstate-law claims homing in on the disposal of stored vehi-\ncles fall outside §14501(c)(1)’s preemptive compass.\n   Our conclusion that state-law claims regarding disposal\nof towed vehicles are not preempted is in full accord\nwith Congress’ purpose in enacting §14501(c)(1). Concerned\nthat state regulation “impeded the free flow of trade,\ntraffic, and transportation of interstate commerce,” Con-\ngress resolved to displace “certain aspects of the State\nregulatory process.” FAAAA §601(a), 108 Stat. 1605 (em-\nphasis added). The target at which it aimed was “a State’s\ndirect substitution of its own governmental commands for\ncompetitive market forces in determining (to a signifi-\ncant degree) the services that motor carriers will pro-\nvide.” Rowe, 552 U. S., at 372 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Pelkey’s claims are far removed from Congress’ driving\n——————\n  5 The parties dispute whether, as Pelkey alleges, conduct that violates\n\nchapter 262 may qualify as an unfair or deceptive act or practice\nproscribed by New Hampshire’s Consumer Protection Act. This dispute\nturns on interpretation of state law, a matter on which we express no\nopinion.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

He sued under state consumer protection and\ntort laws to gain compensation for the alleged unlawful\ndisposal of his vehicle. The state laws in question hardly\nconstrain participation in interstate commerce by requir-\ning a motor carrier to offer services not available in the\nmarket. Nor do the state laws invoked by Pelkey “freez[e]\ninto place services that carriers might prefer to discon-\ntinue in the future.” Ibid. New Hampshire’s laws on dis-\nposal of stored vehicles, moreover, will not open the way for\n“a patchwork of state service-determining laws, rules, and\nregulations.” Id., at 373. As Dan’s City concedes, aban-\ndoned vehicle laws like chapter 262 “do not hamper the\noperations of tow truckers” and “are not the kind of bur-\ndensome state economic regulation Congress sought to\npreempt.” Reply Brief 21.\n                              C\n   Dan’s City advances two further arguments in favor of\npreemption. First, Dan’s City contends that Congress’\nenumeration of exceptions to preemption, detailed in 49\nU. S. C. §§14501(c)(2), (3), and (5), permits state regula-\ntion of motor carriers only when the State’s law comes\nwithin a specified exception. Because Pelkey’s claims do\nnot fit within any exception to preemption, Dan’s City\nurges, those claims must be preempted. This argument\nexceeds sensible bounds. Exceptions to a general rule,\nwhile sometimes a helpful interpretive guide, do not in\nthemselves delineate the scope of the rule. The exceptions\nto §14501(c)(1)’s general rule of preemption identify mat-\nters a State may regulate when it would otherwise be\nprecluded from doing so, but they do not control more than\nthat.\n   An example may clarify the point. Section 14501(c) does\nnot exempt zoning regulations. Such laws, however, “are\npeculiarly within the province of state and local legislative\nauthorities.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508, n. 18\n12            DAN’S CITY USED CARS, INC. v. PELKEY\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\n(1975). It is hardly doubtful that state or local regulation\nof the physical location of motor-carrier operations falls\noutside the preemptive sweep of §14501(c)(1). That is so\nbecause zoning ordinances ordinarily are not “related to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with re-\nspect to the transportation of property.” §14501(c)(1). The\nsame is true of New Hampshire’s regulation of the dis-\nposal of stored vehicles.\n   Dan’s City, in a second argument, urges otherwise.\nPelkey’s claims, Dan’s City maintains, are “related to” the\ntowing service it rendered because selling Pelkey’s car was\nthe means by which Dan’s City obtained payment for the\ntow. But if such state-law claims are preempted, no law\nwould govern resolution of a non-contract-based dispute\narising from a towing company’s disposal of a vehicle\npreviously towed or afford a remedy for wrongful disposal.\nFederal law does not speak to these issues.6 Thus, not\nonly would the preemption urged by Dan’s City leave\nvehicle owners without any recourse for damages, it would\neliminate the sole legal authorization for a towing com-\npany’s disposal of stored vehicles that go unclaimed. No\nsuch design can be attributed to a rational Congress. See\nSilkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984)\n(“It is difficult to believe that Congress would, without\ncomment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those\ninjured by illegal conduct.”).\n   In sum, Dan’s City cannot have it both ways. It cannot\nrely on New Hampshire’s regulatory framework as author-\nization for the sale of Pelkey’s car, yet argue that Pelkey’s\nclaims, invoking the same state-law regime, are preempted.\n——————\n   6 There is an exception to Congress’ silence, but it is of no aid to Dan’s\n\nCity: The Act spares from preemption laws “relating to the price of for-\nhire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation\nis performed [as it was here] without the prior consent or authorization\nof the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.”                  49 U.
