Argued March 19, 2013\u2014Decided May 20, 2013\nThe National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA or Act) es-\n  tablished a no-fault compensation system to stabilize the vaccine\n  market and expedite compensation to injured parties. Bruesewitz v.\n  Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___. Under the Act, \u201c[a] proceeding for\n  compensation\u201d is \u201cinitiated\u201d by \u201cservice upon the Secretary\u201d of Health\n  and Human Services and \u201cthe filing of a petition containing\u201d specified\n  documentation with the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims, who\n  then \u201cimmediately\u201d forwards the petition for assignment to a special\n  master. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). An attorney may not charge a\n  fee for \u201cservices in connection with [such] a petition,\u201d \u00a7300aa\u2013\n  15(e)(3), but a court may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cincurred\n  [by a claimant] in any proceeding on\u201d an unsuccessful \u201cpetition filed\n  under section 300aa\u201311,\u201d if that petition \u201cwas brought in good faith\n  and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition\n  was brought,\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1).\n     In 1997, shortly after receiving her third Hepatitis-B vaccine, re-\n  spondent Cloer began to experience symptoms that eventually led to\n  a multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis in 2003. In 2004, she learned of a\n  link between MS and the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in 2005, she filed a\n  claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that the vaccine\n  caused or exacerbated her MS. After reviewing the petition and its\n  supporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded that\n  Cloer\u2019s claim was untimely because the Act\u2019s 36-month limitations\n  period began to run when she had her first MS symptoms in 1997.\n  The Federal Circuit ultimately agreed that Cloer\u2019s petition was un-\n  timely. Cloer then sought attorney\u2019s fees and costs (collectively, fees).\n  The en banc Federal Circuit found that she was entitled to recover\n2                          SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                                     Syllabus\n\n    fees on her untimely petition.\nHeld: An untimely NCVIA petition may qualify for an award of attor-\n ney\u2019s fees if it is filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis for\n its claim. Pp. 6\u201313.\n    (a) As in any statutory construction case, this Court proceeds from\n the understanding that \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, statutory terms\n are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary mean-\n ing.\u201d BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U. S. 84, 91. Noth-\n ing in either the NCVIA\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees provision, which ties eligi-\n bility to \u201cany proceeding on such petition\u201d and refers specifically to \u201ca\n petition filed under section 300aa\u201311,\u201d or the referenced \u00a7300aa\u201311\n suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition,\n such as its untimeliness, nullifies the initial filing. As the term\n \u201cfiled\u201d is commonly understood, an application is filed \u201cwhen it is de-\n livered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for place-\n ment into the official record.\u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8. Apply-\n ing this ordinary meaning to the text at issue, it is clear that an\n NCVIA petition delivered to the court clerk, forwarded for processing,\n and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a \u201cpetition\n filed under section 300aa\u201311.\u201d So long as it was brought in good faith\n and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s\n fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful. Had Congress intended\n otherwise, it could have easily limited fee awards to timely petitions.\n    The Government\u2019s argument that the 36-month limitations period\n is a statutory prerequisite for filing lacks textual support. First,\n there is no cross-reference to the Act\u2019s limitations provision in its fees\n provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e), or the referenced \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). Second,\n reading the provision to provide that \u201cno petition may be filed for\n compensation\u201d late, as the Government asks, would require the Court\n to conclude that a petition like Cloer\u2019s, which was \u201cfiled\u201d under that\n term\u2019s ordinary meaning but was later found to be untimely, was\n never filed at all. This Court\u2019s \u201cinquiry ceases [where, as here,] \u2018the\n statutory language is unambiguous and \u201cthe statutory scheme is co-\n herent and consistent.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S.\n 438, 450.\n    The Government\u2019s contrary position is also inconsistent with the\n fees provision\u2019s purpose, which was to avoid \u201climit[ing] petitioners\u2019\n ability to obtain qualified assistance\u201d by making awards available for\n \u201cnon-prevailing, good-faith claims.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013908, pt. 1,\n p. 22. Pp. 6\u201310.\n    (b) The Government\u2019s two additional lines of argument for barring\n the award of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions are unpersuasive.\n First, the canon of construction favoring strict construction of waivers\n of sovereign immunity, the presumption favoring the retention of fa-\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  miliar common-law principles, and the policy argument that the\n  NCVIA should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly fees\n  litigation must all give way when, as here, the statute\u2019s words \u201care\n  unambiguous.\u201d Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,\n  253\u2013254. Second, even if the NCVIA\u2019s plain text requires that special\n  masters occasionally carry out \u201cshadow trials\u201d to determine whether\n  late petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis,\n  that is not such an absurd burden as to require departure from the\n  words of the Act. This is especially true where Congress has specifi-\n  cally provided for such \u201cshadow trials\u201d by permitting the award of at-\n  torney\u2019s fees \u201cin any proceeding [on an unsuccessful] petition\u201d if such\n  petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.\n  \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1).

Congress enacted the\nNCVIA to stabilize the vaccine market and expedite com-\npensation to injured parties after complaints mounted\nregarding the inefficiencies and costs borne by both in-\njured consumers and vaccine manufacturers under the pre-\nvious civil tort compensation regime. 562 U. S., at ___\u2013___\n(slip op., at 2\u20133); H. R. Rep. No. 99\u2013908, pt. 1, pp. 6\u20137\n(1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\n   The compensation program\u2019s procedures are straight-\nforward. First, \u201c[a] proceeding for compensation under the\nProgram for a vaccine-related injury or death shall be\ninitiated by service upon the Secretary [for the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services] and the filing of a\npetition containing the matter prescribed by subsection (c)\nof this section with the United States Court of Federal\nClaims.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). Subsection (c) pro-\nvides in relevant part that a petition must include \u201can\naffidavit, and supporting documentation, demonstrating\nthat the person who suffered such injury\u201d was actually\nvaccinated and suffered an injury. \u00a7300aa\u201311(c)(1). Next,\nupon receipt of an NCVIA petition, \u201c[t]he clerk of the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims shall immediately\nforward the filed petition to the chief special master for\nassignment to a special master.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). This\nspecial master then \u201cmakes an informal adjudication of\nthe petition.\u201d Bruesewitz, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3)\n(citing \u00a7300aa\u201312(d)(3)). A successful claimant may re-\ncover medical costs, lost earning capacity, and an award\nfor pain and suffering, 42 U. S.

C. \u00a7\u00a74131, 4132, 9510; 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a7300aa\u201315(f)(4)(A). But under the Act\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion, \u201cno petition may be filed for compensation under the\nProgram for [a vaccine-related] injury after the expiration\nof 36 months after the date of the occurrence of the first\nsymptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant\naggravation of \u201d the alleged injury. \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2).\n   The Act also includes an unusual scheme for compensat-\ning attorneys who work on NCVIA petitions. See \u00a7300aa\u2013\n15(e).1 \u201cNo attorney may charge any fee for services in\nconnection with a petition filed under section 300aa\u201311 of\nthis title.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(3).2 But a court may award\nattorney\u2019s fees in certain circumstances. In the case of\nsuccessful petitions, the award of attorney\u2019s fees is auto-\nmatic. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1) (\u201cIn awarding compensation on a\npetition filed under section 300aa\u201311 of this title the\nspecial master or court shall also award as part of such\ncompensation an amount to cover . . . reasonable attor-\nneys\u2019 fees, and . . . other costs\u201d). For unsuccessful peti-\ntions, \u201cthe special master or court may award an amount\nof compensation to cover petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The  relevant paragraph provides:\n     \u201c(1) In awarding compensation on a petition filed under section\n  300aa\u201311 of this title the special master or court shall also award as\n  part of such compensation an amount to cover\u2014\n     \u201c(A) reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and\n     \u201c(B) other costs,\n  \u201cincurred in any proceeding on such petition. If the judgment of the\n  United States Court of Federal Claims on such a petition does not\n  award compensation, the special master or court may award an\n  amount of compensation to cover petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019\n  fees and other costs incurred in any proceeding on such petition if the\n  special master or court determines that the petition was brought in\n  good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which\n  the petition was brought.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201315(e).\n  2 For simplicity, we refer to attorney\u2019s fees and costs as simply attor-\n\nney\u2019s fees.\n4                   SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfees and other costs incurred in any proceeding on such\npetition if the special master or court determines that the\npetition was brought in good faith and there was a reason-\nable basis for the claim for which the petition was\nbrought.\u201d Ibid. In other words, \u201c[a]ttorney\u2019s fees are\nprovided, not only for successful cases, but even for unsuc-\ncessful claims that are not frivolous.\u201d Bruesewitz, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n                             B\n  Respondent, Dr. Melissa Cloer, received three Hepatitis-\nB immunizations from September 1996 to April 1997.\nShortly after receiving the third vaccine, Dr. Cloer began\nto experience numbness and strange sensations in her left\nforearm and hand. She sought treatment in 1998 and\n1999, but the diagnoses she received were inconclusive.\nBy then, Dr. Cloer was experiencing numbness in her face,\narms, and legs, and she had difficulty walking. She in-\ntermittently suffered these symptoms until 2003, when\nshe began to experience the full manifestations of, and\nwas eventually diagnosed with, multiple sclerosis (MS).\nIn 2004, Dr. Cloer became aware of a link between MS and\nthe Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in September 2005, she filed\na claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that\nthe vaccinations she received had caused or exacerbated\nher MS.\n  Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was sent by the clerk of the Court of\nFederal Claims to the Chief Special Master, who went on\nto adjudicate it. After reviewing the petition and its sup-\nporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded\nthat Dr. Cloer\u2019s claim was untimely because the Act\u2019s\n36-month limitations period began to run when she first\nexperienced the symptoms of MS in 1997. Cloer v. Secre-\ntary of Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 05\u20131002V,\n2008 WL 2275574, *1, *10 (Fed. Cl., May 15, 2008) (opin-\nion of Golkiewicz, Chief Special Master) (citing \u00a7300aa\u2013\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Relying on\nFederal Circuit precedent, the Chief Special Master also\nrejected Dr. Cloer\u2019s argument that the NCVIA\u2019s limita-\ntions period should be subject to equitable tolling. Id., at\n*9 (citing Brice v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,\n240 F. 3d 1367, 1373 (2001)). A divided panel of the Fed-\neral Circuit reversed the Chief Special Master, concluding\nthat the NCVIA\u2019s limitations period did not commence\nuntil \u201cthe medical community at large objectively recog-\nnize[d] a link between the vaccine and the injury.\u201d Cloer\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 603 F. 3d 1341,\n1346 (2010).\n   The en banc court then reversed the panel\u2019s decision,\nCloer v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 654 F. 3d\n1322 (2011), cert. denied, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), and held\nthat the statute\u2019s limitations period begins to run on \u201cthe\ncalendar date of the occurrence of the first medically\nrecognized symptom or manifestation of onset of the injury\nclaimed by the petitioner.\u201d 654 F. 3d, at 1324\u20131325. The\nCourt of Appeals also held that the Act\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion was nonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling\nin limited circumstances, overruling its prior holding in\nBrice. 654 F. 3d, at 1341\u20131344. The court concluded,\nhowever, that Dr. Cloer was ineligible for tolling and that\nher petition was untimely. Id., at 1344\u20131345.\n   Following this decision, Dr. Cloer moved for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees. The en banc Federal Circuit agreed with\nher that a person who files an untimely NCVIA petition\n\u201cassert[ing] a reasonable limitations argument\u201d may re-\ncover fees and costs so long as \u201c \u2018the petition was brought\nin good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the\nclaim for which the petition was brought.\u2019 \u201d 675 F. 3d\n1358, 1359\u20131361 (2012) (quoting \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1)). Six\njudges disagreed with this conclusion and instead read the\nNCVIA to bar such awards for untimely petitions. Id., at\n1364\u20131368 (Bryson, J., dissenting).

C. \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), (3).\nSection 300aa\u201311 provides that \u201c[a] proceeding for com-\npensation\u201d is \u201cinitiated\u201d by \u201cservice upon the Secretary\u201d\nand \u201cthe filing of a petition containing\u201d certain documen-\ntation with the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims who\nthen \u201cimmediately forward[s] the filed petition\u201d for as-\nsignment to a special master. \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). See supra,\nat 2.\n  Nothing in these two provisions suggests that the rea-\nson for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as its\nuntimeliness, nullifies the initial filing of that petition.\nWe have explained that \u201c[a]n application is \u2018filed,\u2019 as that\nterm is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and\naccepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement\ninto the official record.\u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8\n(2000). When this ordinary meaning is applied to the text\nof the statute, it is clear that an NCVIA petition which is\ndelivered to the clerk of the court, forwarded for pro-\ncessing, and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special\nmaster is a \u201cpetition filed under section 300aa\u201311.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). And so long as such a petition\nwas brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, it\nis eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, even if it is\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nultimately unsuccessful. Ibid. If Congress had intended\nto limit fee awards to timely petitions, it could easily have\ndone so. But the NCVIA instead authorizes courts to\naward attorney\u2019s fees for those unsuccessful petitions\n\u201cbrought in good faith and [for which] there was a reason-\nable basis.\u201d Ibid.3\n   The Government argues that the Act\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion, which states that \u201cno petition may be filed for com-\npensation\u201d 36 months after a claimant\u2019s initial symptoms\nbegan, \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2), constitutes \u201ca statutory prerequi-\nsite to the filing of a petition \u2018for compensation under the\nProgram,\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 16. Thus, the Government\ncontends, a petition that fails to comply with these time\nlimits is not \u201ca petition filed under section 300aa\u201311\u201d and\nis therefore ineligible for fees under \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). See\n675 F. 3d, at 1364\u20131366 (Bryson, J., dissenting).\n   The Government\u2019s argument lacks textual support.\nFirst, as noted, there is no cross-reference to the Act\u2019s\nlimitations provision in its fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e), or\nthe other section it references, \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). When\nthese two linked sections are read in tandem they simply\nindicate that petitions filed with the clerk of the court are\neligible for attorney\u2019s fees so long as they comply with the\nother requirements of the Act\u2019s fees provision. By its\nterms, the NCVIA requires nothing more for the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees. A petition filed in violation of the limita-\ntions period will not result in the payment of compensa-\ntion, of course, but it is still a petition filed under \u00a7300aa\u2013\n11(a)(1).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The en banc dissent reasoned that a dismissal for untimeliness does\n\nnot constitute a judgment on the merits of a petition. See 675 F. 3d\n1358, 1365 (CA Fed. 2012) (opinion of Bryson, J.). That argument is\nnot pressed here by the Government, which acknowledged at oral\nargument that dismissals for untimeliness result in judgment against\nthe petitioner. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313.\n  4 The Government suggests that giving the words of their statute\n8                        SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   When the Act does require compliance with the limita-\ntions period, it provides so expressly. For example,\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(2)(A) prevents claimants from bringing suit\nagainst vaccine manufacturers \u201cunless a petition has been\nfiled, in accordance with section 300aa\u201316 of this title [the\nlimitations provision], for compensation under the Pro-\ngram for such injury or death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We\nhave long held that \u201c[w]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate\ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Bates v. United States, 522 U. S.\n23, 29\u201330 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nabsence of any cross-reference to the limitations provision\nin either the fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), or the in-\nstructions for initiating a compensation proceeding,\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1), indicates that a petition can be \u201cfiled\u201d\nwithout being \u201cin accordance with [the limitations provi-\nsion].\u201d Tellingly, nothing in \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1) requires a\npetitioner to allege or demonstrate the timeliness of his or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntheir plain meaning would produce incongruous results; notably, it\nmight indicate that \u201ca failure to comply with the limitations provision\nwould not even bar recovery under the Compensation Program itself\nbecause 42 U. S. C. 300aa-13 (\u2018Determination of eligibility and compen-\nsation\u2019) does not expressly cross-reference the limitations provision.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 18. The Government\u2019s argument assumes that both\nsections are equivalently affected by absence of a cross-reference. This\nis incorrect. The Government is right that because \u201cthe law typically\ntreats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense,\u201d John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133 (2008), a failure to apply\nthe limitations provision to the section outlining the conditions under\nwhich compensation should be awarded would be \u201ccontrary to [the\nAct\u2019s] plain meaning and would produce an absurd result,\u201d Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. 229, 252 (2010). In\ncontrast, giving the Act\u2019s fees provision its plain meaning would pro-\nduce no such absurd result. It would simply allow petitioners to recover\nattorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nher petition to initiate such a proceeding.5\n   Second, to adopt the Government\u2019s position, we would\nhave to conclude that a petition like Dr. Cloer\u2019s, which was\n\u201cfiled\u201d under the ordinary meaning of that term but was\nlater found to be untimely, was never filed at all because,\non the Government\u2019s reading, \u201cno petition may be filed for\ncompensation\u201d late. \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2) (emphasis added).\nYet the court below identified numerous instances\nthroughout the NCVIA where the word \u201cfiled\u201d is given its\nordinary meaning, 675 F. 3d, at 1361, and the Govern-\nment does not challenge this aspect of its decision. In-\ndeed, the Government\u2019s reading would produce anomalous\nresults with respect to these other NCVIA provisions.\nConsider \u00a7300aa\u201312(b)(2), which provides that \u201c[w]ithin\n30 days after the Secretary receives service of any petition\nfiled under section 300aa\u201311 of this title the Secretary\nshall publish notice of such petition in the Federal Regis-\nter.\u201d If the NCVIA\u2019s limitations provision worked to void\nthe filing of an untimely petition, then one would expect\nthe Secretary to make timeliness determinations prior to\npublishing such notice or to strike any petitions found to\nbe untimely from the Federal Register. But there is no\nindication that the Secretary does either of these things.6\n   The Government asks us to adopt a different definition\nof the term \u201cfiled\u201d for a single subsection so that for fees\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the NCVIA\u2019s limitations period were jurisdictional, then we might\n\nreach a different conclusion because the Chief Special Master would\nhave lacked authority to act on Dr. Cloer\u2019s untimely petition in the first\nplace. But the Government chose not to seek certiorari from the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s en banc decision holding that the period is nonjuris-\ndictional, see Cloer v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 654 F. 3d\n1332, 1341\u20131344 (2011), and the Government now acknowledges that\nthe NCVIA contains no \u201cclear statement\u201d that \u00a7300aa\u201316\u2019s filing\ndeadlines carry jurisdictional consequences. See Reply Brief 7 (discuss-\ning Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)).\n   6 Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was published, and remains, in the Federal Reg-\n\nister. See 70 Fed. Reg. 73011, 73014 (2005).\n10                   SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npurposes, and only for fees purposes, a petition filed out of\ntime must be treated retroactively as though it was never\nfiled in the first place. Nothing in the text or structure of\nthe statute requires the unusual result the Government\nasks us to accept. In the NCVIA, the word \u201cfiled\u201d carries\nits common meaning. See Artuz, 531 U. S., at 8. That \u201cno\npetition may be filed for compensation\u201d after the limita-\ntions period has run does not mean that a late petition\nwas never filed at all.\n   Our \u201cinquiry ceases [in a statutory construction case] if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory\nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon\nCoal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (2002) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The text of the statute is clear: like any\nother unsuccessful petition, an untimely petition brought\nin good faith and with a reasonable basis that is filed\nwith\u2014meaning delivered to and received by\u2014the clerk of\nthe Court of Federal Claims is eligible for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s position is also inconsistent with the\ngoals of the fees provision itself. A stated purpose of the\nAct\u2019s fees scheme was to avoid \u201climit[ing] petitioners\u2019\nability to obtain qualified assistance\u201d by making fees\nawards available for \u201cnon-prevailing, good-faith claims.\u201d\nH. R. Rep., at 22. The Government does not explain why\nCongress would have intended to discourage counsel from\nrepresenting petitioners who, because of the difficulty of\ndistinguishing between the initial symptoms of a vaccine-\nrelated injury and an unrelated malady, see, e.g., Smith v.\nSecretary of Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 02\u2013\n93V, 2006 WL 5610517, *6\u2013*7 (Fed. Cl., July 21, 2006)\n(opinion of Golkiewicz, Chief Special Master), may have\ngood-faith claims with a reasonable basis that will only\nlater be found untimely.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n   The Government offers two additional lines of argument\nfor barring the award of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely peti-\ntions. It first invokes two canons of construction: the\ncanon favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign\nimmunity and the \u201c \u2018presumption favoring the retention of\nlong-established and familiar [common-law] principles.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 32 (quoting United States v. Texas, 507\nU. S. 529, 534 (1993)). Similarly, the Government also\nargues that the NCVIA should be construed so as to min-\nimize complex and costly fees litigation. But as the Gov-\nernment acknowledges, such canons and policy arguments\ncome into play only \u201c[t]o the extent that the Vaccine Act is\nambiguous.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. These \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d give way when \u201cthe words of a statute are unam-\nbiguous,\u201d as they are here. Connecticut Nat. Bank v.\nGermain, 503 U. S. 249, 253\u2013254 (1992).\n   Second, the Government argues that permitting the\nrecovery of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions will force\nspecial masters to carry out costly and wasteful \u201cshadow\ntrials,\u201d with no benefit to claimants, in order to determine\nwhether these late petitions were brought in good faith\nand with a reasonable basis. We reiterate that \u201cwhen [a]\nstatute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the\ncourts\u2014at least where the disposition required by the text\nis not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d\nHartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank,\nN. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Consequently, even if the plain text of the\nNCVIA requires that special masters occasionally carry\nout such \u201cshadow trials,\u201d that is not such an absurd bur-\nden as to require departure from the words of the Act.\nThis is particularly true here because Congress has specif-\nically provided for such \u201cshadow trials\u201d by permitting the\naward of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin any proceeding [on an unsuc-\ncessful] petition\u201d if such petition was brought in good faith\n12                       SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nand with a reasonable basis, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1)\n(emphasis added), irrespective of the reasons for the peti-\ntion\u2019s failure, see, e.g., Caves v. Secretary of Health and\nHuman Servs., No. 07\u2013443V, 2012 WL 6951286, *2, *13\n(Fed. Cl., Dec. 20, 2012) (opinion of Moran, Special Mas-\nter) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees despite petitioner\u2019s failure to\nprove causation).\n   In any event, the Government\u2019s fears appear to us exag-\ngerated. Special masters consistently make fee deter-\nminations on the basis of the extensive documentation\nrequired by \u00a7300aa\u201311(c) and included with the petition.7\nIndeed, when adjudicating the timeliness of a petition, the\nspecial master may often have to develop a good sense of\nthe merits of a case, and will therefore be able to deter-\nmine if a reasonable basis exists for the petitioner\u2019s claim,\nincluding whether there is a good-faith reason for the\nuntimely filing. In this case, for example, the Chief Spe-\ncial Master conducted a \u201creview of the record as a whole,\u201d\nincluding the medical evidence that would have supported\nthe merits of Dr. Cloer\u2019s claim, before determining that\nher petition was untimely. Cloer, 2008 WL 2275574, *1\u2013\n*2, *10.\n   The Government also argues that permitting attorney\u2019s\nfees on untimely petitions will lead to the filing of more\nuntimely petitions. But the Government offers no evi-\ndence to support its speculation. Additionally, this argu-\nment is premised on the assumption that in the pursuit of\nfees, attorneys will choose to bring claims lacking good\nfaith or a reasonable basis in derogation of their ethical\nduties. There is no basis for such an assumption. Finally,\nthe special masters have shown themselves more than\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See, e.g., Wells v.

In 2004, she learned of a\n  link between MS and the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in 2005, she filed a\n  claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that the vaccine\n  caused or exacerbated her MS. After reviewing the petition and its\n  supporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded that\n  Cloer\u2019s claim was untimely because the Act\u2019s 36-month limitations\n  period began to run when she had her first MS symptoms in 1997.\n  The Federal Circuit ultimately agreed that Cloer\u2019s petition was un-\n  timely.

Pp. 6\u201313.\n    (a) As in any statutory construction case, this Court proceeds from\n the understanding that \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, statutory terms\n are generally interpreted in accordance with their ordinary mean-\n ing.\u201d BP America Production Co. v. Burton, 549 U. S. 84, 91. Noth-\n ing in either the NCVIA\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees provision, which ties eligi-\n bility to \u201cany proceeding on such petition\u201d and refers specifically to \u201ca\n petition filed under section 300aa\u201311,\u201d or the referenced \u00a7300aa\u201311\n suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition,\n such as its untimeliness, nullifies the initial filing. As the term\n \u201cfiled\u201d is commonly understood, an application is filed \u201cwhen it is de-\n livered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for place-\n ment into the official record.\u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8. Apply-\n ing this ordinary meaning to the text at issue, it is clear that an\n NCVIA petition delivered to the court clerk, forwarded for processing,\n and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a \u201cpetition\n filed under section 300aa\u201311.\u201d So long as it was brought in good faith\n and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s\n fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful. Had Congress intended\n otherwise, it could have easily limited fee awards to timely petitions.\n    The Government\u2019s argument that the 36-month limitations period\n is a statutory prerequisite for filing lacks textual support. First,\n there is no cross-reference to the Act\u2019s limitations provision in its fees\n provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e), or the referenced \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). Second,\n reading the provision to provide that \u201cno petition may be filed for\n compensation\u201d late, as the Government asks, would require the Court\n to conclude that a petition like Cloer\u2019s, which was \u201cfiled\u201d under that\n term\u2019s ordinary meaning but was later found to be untimely, was\n never filed at all.

In the case of\nsuccessful petitions, the award of attorney\u2019s fees is auto-\nmatic. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1) (\u201cIn awarding compensation on a\npetition filed under section 300aa\u201311 of this title the\nspecial master or court shall also award as part of such\ncompensation an amount to cover . . . reasonable attor-\nneys\u2019 fees, and . . . other costs\u201d).

If the judgment of the\n  United States Court of Federal Claims on such a petition does not\n  award compensation, the special master or court may award an\n  amount of compensation to cover petitioner\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019\n  fees and other costs incurred in any proceeding on such petition if the\n  special master or court determines that the petition was brought in\n  good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which\n  the petition was brought.\u201d \u00a7300aa\u201315(e).\n  2 For simplicity, we refer to attorney\u2019s fees and costs as simply attor-\n\nney\u2019s fees.\n4                   SEBELIUS v.

In other words, \u201c[a]ttorney\u2019s fees are\nprovided, not only for successful cases, but even for unsuc-\ncessful claims that are not frivolous.\u201d Bruesewitz, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n                             B\n  Respondent, Dr. Melissa Cloer, received three Hepatitis-\nB immunizations from September 1996 to April 1997.\nShortly after receiving the third vaccine, Dr. Cloer began\nto experience numbness and strange sensations in her left\nforearm and hand. She sought treatment in 1998 and\n1999, but the diagnoses she received were inconclusive.\nBy then, Dr. Cloer was experiencing numbness in her face,\narms, and legs, and she had difficulty walking. She in-\ntermittently suffered these symptoms until 2003, when\nshe began to experience the full manifestations of, and\nwas eventually diagnosed with, multiple sclerosis (MS).\nIn 2004, Dr. Cloer became aware of a link between MS and\nthe Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in September 2005, she filed\na claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that\nthe vaccinations she received had caused or exacerbated\nher MS.\n  Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was sent by the clerk of the Court of\nFederal Claims to the Chief Special Master, who went on\nto adjudicate it. After reviewing the petition and its sup-\nporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded\nthat Dr. Cloer\u2019s claim was untimely because the Act\u2019s\n36-month limitations period began to run when she first\nexperienced the symptoms of MS in 1997.

Relying on\nFederal Circuit precedent, the Chief Special Master also\nrejected Dr. Cloer\u2019s argument that the NCVIA\u2019s limita-\ntions period should be subject to equitable tolling. Id., at\n*9 (citing Brice v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs.,\n240 F. 3d 1367, 1373 (2001)). A divided panel of the Fed-\neral Circuit reversed the Chief Special Master, concluding\nthat the NCVIA\u2019s limitations period did not commence\nuntil \u201cthe medical community at large objectively recog-\nnize[d] a link between the vaccine and the injury.\u201d Cloer\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 603 F. 3d 1341,\n1346 (2010).\n   The en banc court then reversed the panel\u2019s decision,\nCloer v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 654 F. 3d\n1322 (2011), cert. denied, 566 U. S. ___ (2012), and held\nthat the statute\u2019s limitations period begins to run on \u201cthe\ncalendar date of the occurrence of the first medically\nrecognized symptom or manifestation of onset of the injury\nclaimed by the petitioner.\u201d 654 F. 3d, at 1324\u20131325. The\nCourt of Appeals also held that the Act\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion was nonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling\nin limited circumstances, overruling its prior holding in\nBrice. 654 F. 3d, at 1341\u20131344. The court concluded,\nhowever, that Dr. Cloer was ineligible for tolling and that\nher petition was untimely. Id., at 1344\u20131345.\n   Following this decision, Dr. Cloer moved for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees. The en banc Federal Circuit agreed with\nher that a person who files an untimely NCVIA petition\n\u201cassert[ing] a reasonable limitations argument\u201d may re-\ncover fees and costs so long as \u201c \u2018the petition was brought\nin good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the\nclaim for which the petition was brought.\u2019 \u201d 675 F. 3d\n1358, 1359\u20131361 (2012) (quoting \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1)). Six\njudges disagreed with this conclusion and instead read the\nNCVIA to bar such awards for untimely petitions. Id., at\n1364\u20131368 (Bryson, J., dissenting). We granted the Gov-\n6                    SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nernment\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari.    568 U. S. ___\n(2012). We now affirm.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n  As in any statutory construction case, \u201c[w]e start, of\ncourse, with the statutory text,\u201d and proceed from the\nunderstanding that \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, statutory\nterms are generally interpreted in accordance with their\nordinary meaning.\u201d BP America Production Co. v. Burton,\n549 U. S. 84, 91 (2006). The Act\u2019s fees provision ties eligi-\nbility for attorney\u2019s fees broadly to \u201cany proceeding on\nsuch petition,\u201d referring specifically to \u201ca petition filed\nunder section 300aa\u201311.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), (3).\nSection 300aa\u201311 provides that \u201c[a] proceeding for com-\npensation\u201d is \u201cinitiated\u201d by \u201cservice upon the Secretary\u201d\nand \u201cthe filing of a petition containing\u201d certain documen-\ntation with the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims who\nthen \u201cimmediately forward[s] the filed petition\u201d for as-\nsignment to a special master. \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). See supra,\nat 2.\n  Nothing in these two provisions suggests that the rea-\nson for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as its\nuntimeliness, nullifies the initial filing of that petition.\nWe have explained that \u201c[a]n application is \u2018filed,\u2019 as that\nterm is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and\naccepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement\ninto the official record.\u201d Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4, 8\n(2000). When this ordinary meaning is applied to the text\nof the statute, it is clear that an NCVIA petition which is\ndelivered to the clerk of the court, forwarded for pro-\ncessing, and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special\nmaster is a \u201cpetition filed under section 300aa\u201311.\u201d 42\nU. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). And so long as such a petition\nwas brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, it\nis eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees, even if it is\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nultimately unsuccessful. Ibid. If Congress had intended\nto limit fee awards to timely petitions, it could easily have\ndone so. But the NCVIA instead authorizes courts to\naward attorney\u2019s fees for those unsuccessful petitions\n\u201cbrought in good faith and [for which] there was a reason-\nable basis.\u201d Ibid.3\n   The Government argues that the Act\u2019s limitations provi-\nsion, which states that \u201cno petition may be filed for com-\npensation\u201d 36 months after a claimant\u2019s initial symptoms\nbegan, \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2), constitutes \u201ca statutory prerequi-\nsite to the filing of a petition \u2018for compensation under the\nProgram,\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 16. Thus, the Government\ncontends, a petition that fails to comply with these time\nlimits is not \u201ca petition filed under section 300aa\u201311\u201d and\nis therefore ineligible for fees under \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1). See\n675 F. 3d, at 1364\u20131366 (Bryson, J., dissenting).\n   The Government\u2019s argument lacks textual support.\nFirst, as noted, there is no cross-reference to the Act\u2019s\nlimitations provision in its fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e), or\nthe other section it references, \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1). When\nthese two linked sections are read in tandem they simply\nindicate that petitions filed with the clerk of the court are\neligible for attorney\u2019s fees so long as they comply with the\nother requirements of the Act\u2019s fees provision. By its\nterms, the NCVIA requires nothing more for the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees. A petition filed in violation of the limita-\ntions period will not result in the payment of compensa-\ntion, of course, but it is still a petition filed under \u00a7300aa\u2013\n11(a)(1).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The en banc dissent reasoned that a dismissal for untimeliness does\n\nnot constitute a judgment on the merits of a petition. See 675 F. 3d\n1358, 1365 (CA Fed. 2012) (opinion of Bryson, J.). That argument is\nnot pressed here by the Government, which acknowledged at oral\nargument that dismissals for untimeliness result in judgment against\nthe petitioner. Tr. of Oral Arg. 12\u201313.\n  4 The Government suggests that giving the words of their statute\n8                        SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   When the Act does require compliance with the limita-\ntions period, it provides so expressly. For example,\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(2)(A) prevents claimants from bringing suit\nagainst vaccine manufacturers \u201cunless a petition has been\nfiled, in accordance with section 300aa\u201316 of this title [the\nlimitations provision], for compensation under the Pro-\ngram for such injury or death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We\nhave long held that \u201c[w]here Congress includes particular\nlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that\nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate\ninclusion or exclusion.\u201d Bates v. United States, 522 U. S.\n23, 29\u201330 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nabsence of any cross-reference to the limitations provision\nin either the fees provision, \u00a7300aa\u201315(e)(1), or the in-\nstructions for initiating a compensation proceeding,\n\u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1), indicates that a petition can be \u201cfiled\u201d\nwithout being \u201cin accordance with [the limitations provi-\nsion].\u201d Tellingly, nothing in \u00a7300aa\u201311(a)(1) requires a\npetitioner to allege or demonstrate the timeliness of his or\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntheir plain meaning would produce incongruous results; notably, it\nmight indicate that \u201ca failure to comply with the limitations provision\nwould not even bar recovery under the Compensation Program itself\nbecause 42 U. S. C. 300aa-13 (\u2018Determination of eligibility and compen-\nsation\u2019) does not expressly cross-reference the limitations provision.\u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 18. The Government\u2019s argument assumes that both\nsections are equivalently affected by absence of a cross-reference. This\nis incorrect. The Government is right that because \u201cthe law typically\ntreats a limitations defense as an affirmative defense,\u201d John R. Sand &\nGravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 133 (2008), a failure to apply\nthe limitations provision to the section outlining the conditions under\nwhich compensation should be awarded would be \u201ccontrary to [the\nAct\u2019s] plain meaning and would produce an absurd result,\u201d Milavetz,\nGallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United States, 559 U. S. 229, 252 (2010). In\ncontrast, giving the Act\u2019s fees provision its plain meaning would pro-\nduce no such absurd result. It would simply allow petitioners to recover\nattorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nher petition to initiate such a proceeding.5\n   Second, to adopt the Government\u2019s position, we would\nhave to conclude that a petition like Dr. Cloer\u2019s, which was\n\u201cfiled\u201d under the ordinary meaning of that term but was\nlater found to be untimely, was never filed at all because,\non the Government\u2019s reading, \u201cno petition may be filed for\ncompensation\u201d late. \u00a7300aa\u201316(a)(2) (emphasis added).\nYet the court below identified numerous instances\nthroughout the NCVIA where the word \u201cfiled\u201d is given its\nordinary meaning, 675 F. 3d, at 1361, and the Govern-\nment does not challenge this aspect of its decision. In-\ndeed, the Government\u2019s reading would produce anomalous\nresults with respect to these other NCVIA provisions.\nConsider \u00a7300aa\u201312(b)(2), which provides that \u201c[w]ithin\n30 days after the Secretary receives service of any petition\nfiled under section 300aa\u201311 of this title the Secretary\nshall publish notice of such petition in the Federal Regis-\nter.\u201d If the NCVIA\u2019s limitations provision worked to void\nthe filing of an untimely petition, then one would expect\nthe Secretary to make timeliness determinations prior to\npublishing such notice or to strike any petitions found to\nbe untimely from the Federal Register. But there is no\nindication that the Secretary does either of these things.6\n   The Government asks us to adopt a different definition\nof the term \u201cfiled\u201d for a single subsection so that for fees\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 If the NCVIA\u2019s limitations period were jurisdictional, then we might\n\nreach a different conclusion because the Chief Special Master would\nhave lacked authority to act on Dr. Cloer\u2019s untimely petition in the first\nplace. But the Government chose not to seek certiorari from the\nFederal Circuit\u2019s en banc decision holding that the period is nonjuris-\ndictional, see Cloer v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., 654 F. 3d\n1332, 1341\u20131344 (2011), and the Government now acknowledges that\nthe NCVIA contains no \u201cclear statement\u201d that \u00a7300aa\u201316\u2019s filing\ndeadlines carry jurisdictional consequences. See Reply Brief 7 (discuss-\ning Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___ (2013)).\n   6 Dr. Cloer\u2019s petition was published, and remains, in the Federal Reg-\n\nister. See 70 Fed. Reg. 73011, 73014 (2005).\n10                   SEBELIUS v. CLOER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npurposes, and only for fees purposes, a petition filed out of\ntime must be treated retroactively as though it was never\nfiled in the first place. Nothing in the text or structure of\nthe statute requires the unusual result the Government\nasks us to accept. In the NCVIA, the word \u201cfiled\u201d carries\nits common meaning. See Artuz, 531 U. S., at 8. That \u201cno\npetition may be filed for compensation\u201d after the limita-\ntions period has run does not mean that a late petition\nwas never filed at all.\n   Our \u201cinquiry ceases [in a statutory construction case] if\nthe statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory\nscheme is coherent and consistent.\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon\nCoal Co., 534 U. S. 438, 450 (2002) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). The text of the statute is clear: like any\nother unsuccessful petition, an untimely petition brought\nin good faith and with a reasonable basis that is filed\nwith\u2014meaning delivered to and received by\u2014the clerk of\nthe Court of Federal Claims is eligible for an award of\nattorney\u2019s fees.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s position is also inconsistent with the\ngoals of the fees provision itself. A stated purpose of the\nAct\u2019s fees scheme was to avoid \u201climit[ing] petitioners\u2019\nability to obtain qualified assistance\u201d by making fees\nawards available for \u201cnon-prevailing, good-faith claims.\u201d\nH. R. Rep., at 22. The Government does not explain why\nCongress would have intended to discourage counsel from\nrepresenting petitioners who, because of the difficulty of\ndistinguishing between the initial symptoms of a vaccine-\nrelated injury and an unrelated malady, see, e.g., Smith v.\nSecretary of Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 02\u2013\n93V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5610517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6\u2013*7 (Fed.

S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                              III\n   The Government offers two additional lines of argument\nfor barring the award of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely peti-\ntions. It first invokes two canons of construction: the\ncanon favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign\nimmunity and the \u201c \u2018presumption favoring the retention of\nlong-established and familiar [common-law] principles.\u2019 \u201d\nBrief for Petitioner 32 (quoting United States v. Texas, 507\nU. S. 529, 534 (1993)). Similarly, the Government also\nargues that the NCVIA should be construed so as to min-\nimize complex and costly fees litigation. But as the Gov-\nernment acknowledges, such canons and policy arguments\ncome into play only \u201c[t]o the extent that the Vaccine Act is\nambiguous.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 28. These \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d give way when \u201cthe words of a statute are unam-\nbiguous,\u201d as they are here. Connecticut Nat. Bank v.\nGermain, 503 U. S. 249, 253\u2013254 (1992).\n   Second, the Government argues that permitting the\nrecovery of attorney\u2019s fees for untimely petitions will force\nspecial masters to carry out costly and wasteful \u201cshadow\ntrials,\u201d with no benefit to claimants, in order to determine\nwhether these late petitions were brought in good faith\nand with a reasonable basis. We reiterate that \u201cwhen [a]\nstatute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the\ncourts\u2014at least where the disposition required by the text\nis not absurd\u2014is to enforce it according to its terms.\u201d\nHartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank,\nN. A., 530 U. S. 1, 6 (2000) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Consequently, even if the plain text of the\nNCVIA requires that special masters occasionally carry\nout such \u201cshadow trials,\u201d that is not such an absurd bur-\nden as to require departure from the words of the Act.\nThis is particularly true here because Congress has specif-\nically provided for such \u201cshadow trials\u201d by permitting the\naward of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin any proceeding [on an unsuc-\ncessful] petition\u201d if such petition was brought in good faith\n12                       SEBELIUS v.

Cl., Dec. 20, 2012) (opinion of Moran, Special Mas-\nter) (awarding attorney\u2019s fees despite petitioner\u2019s failure to\nprove causation).\n   In any event, the Government\u2019s fears appear to us exag-\ngerated. Special masters consistently make fee deter-\nminations on the basis of the extensive documentation\nrequired by \u00a7300aa\u201311(c) and included with the petition.7\nIndeed, when adjudicating the timeliness of a petition, the\nspecial master may often have to develop a good sense of\nthe merits of a case, and will therefore be able to deter-\nmine if a reasonable basis exists for the petitioner\u2019s claim,\nincluding whether there is a good-faith reason for the\nuntimely filing. In this case, for example, the Chief Spe-\ncial Master conducted a \u201creview of the record as a whole,\u201d\nincluding the medical evidence that would have supported\nthe merits of Dr. Cloer\u2019s claim, before determining that\nher petition was untimely.

But the Government offers no evi-\ndence to support its speculation. Additionally, this argu-\nment is premised on the assumption that in the pursuit of\nfees, attorneys will choose to bring claims lacking good\nfaith or a reasonable basis in derogation of their ethical\nduties. There is no basis for such an assumption. Finally,\nthe special masters have shown themselves more than\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 See, e.g., Wells v.
