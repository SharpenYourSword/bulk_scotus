Argued February 20, 2013—Decided May 20, 2013\nIn 1997, the United Kingdom (U. K.), newly under Labour Party rule,\n  imposed a one-time “windfall tax” on 32 U. K. companies privatized\n  between 1984 and 1996 by the Conservative government. The com-\n  panies had been sold to private parties through an initial sale of\n  shares, known as a “flotation.” Some of the companies were required\n  to continue providing services for a fixed period at the same rates\n  they had offered under government control. Many of those companies\n  became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in\n  the process.\n     Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL), part owner of a privatized U. K.\n  company subject to the windfall tax, claimed a credit for its share of\n  the bill in its 1997 federal income-tax return, relying on Internal\n  Revenue Code §901(b)(1), which states that any “income, war profits,\n  and excess profits taxes” paid overseas are creditable against U. S.\n  income taxes. Treasury Regulation §1.901–2(a)(1) interprets this sec-\n  tion to mean that a foreign tax is creditable if its “predominant char-\n  acter” “is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.” The Commission-\n  er of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected PPL’s claim, but the\n  Tax Court held that the U. K. windfall tax was creditable for U. S.\n  tax purposes under §901. The Third Circuit reversed.\nHeld: The U. K. tax is creditable under §901. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) Treasury Regulation §1.901–2, which codifies longstanding doc-\n trine dating back to Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 573, 578–579\n (1938), provides the relevant legal standard. First, a tax’s “predomi-\n nant character,” or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is con-\n trolling. See id., at 579. Thus, a foreign tax that operates as an in-\n come, war profits, or excess profits tax for most taxpayers is generally\n2                     PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    creditable. Second, foreign tax creditability depends not on the way a\n    foreign government characterizes its tax but on whether the tax, if\n    enacted in the U. S., would be an income, war profits, or excess prof-\n    its tax. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii). Giving further form to these princi-\n    ples, §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s predominant char-\n    acter is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . . the foreign tax is likely to\n    reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.”\n    Three tests set forth in the regulations provide guidance in making\n    this assessment, see §1.901–2(b)(1). The tests indicate that net gain\n    consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and ex-\n    penses attributable to such gross receipts, in combination known as\n    net income. A foreign tax that reaches net income, or profits, is cred-\n    itable. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The U. K. windfall tax’s predominant character is that of an ex-\n    cess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. The La-\n    bour government’s conception of “profit-making value” as a backward-\n    looking analysis of historic profits is not a typical valuation\n    method. Rather, it is a tax on realized net income disguised as a\n    tax on the difference between two values, one of which is a fictitious\n    value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio. The sub-\n    stance of the windfall tax confirms this conclusion. When rear-\n    ranged, the U. K’s formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is eco-\n    nomically equivalent to the difference between the profits each\n    company actually earned and the amount the Labour government be-\n    lieved it should have earned given its flotation value. For most of the\n    relevant companies, the U. K. formula’s substantive effect was to im-\n    pose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits above a threshold, a classic ex-\n    cess profits tax. The Commissioner claims that any algebraic rear-\n    rangement is improper because U. S. courts must take the foreign tax\n    rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports\n    to adopt. But such a rigid construction cannot be squared with the\n    black-letter principle that “tax law deals in economic realities, not le-\n    gal abstractions.” Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 350\n    U. S. 308, 315. Given the artificiality of the U. K.’s calculation meth-\n    od, this Court follows substance over form and recognizes that the\n    windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a\n    threshold. Pp. 7–11.\n       (c) The Commissioner’s additional arguments in support of his po-\n    sition are similarly unpersuasive.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                [May 20, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 1997, the United Kingdom (U. K.) imposed a one-time\n“windfall tax” on 32 U. K. companies privatized between\n1984 and 1996. This case addresses whether that tax\nis creditable for U. S. tax purposes. Internal Revenue Code\n§901(b)(1) states that any “income, war profits, and excess\nprofits taxes” paid overseas are creditable against U. S.\nincome taxes. 26 U. S. C. §901(b)(1). Treasury Regula­\ntions interpret this section to mean that a foreign tax is\ncreditable if its “predominant character” “is that of an\nincome tax in the U. S. sense.” Treas. Reg. §1.901–\n2(a)(1)(ii), 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1) (1992). Consistent with\nprecedent and the Tax Court’s analysis below, we apply\nthe predominant character test using a commonsense\napproach that considers the substantive effect of the tax.\nUnder this approach, we hold that the U. K. tax is credit­\nable under §901 and reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit.\n                          I\n                          A\n  During the 1980’s and 1990’s, the U. K.’s Conservative\n2                PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParty controlled Parliament and privatized a number of\ngovernment-owned companies. These companies were\nsold to private parties through an initial sale of shares,\nknown as a “flotation.” As part of privatization, many com­\npanies were required to continue providing services at the\nsame rates they had offered under government control\nfor a fixed period, typically their first four years of private\noperation. As a result, the companies could only increase\nprofits during this period by operating more efficiently.\nResponding to market incentives, many of the companies\nbecame dramatically more efficient and earned substantial\nprofits in the process.\n   The U. K.’s Labour Party, which had unsuccessfully\nopposed privatization, used the companies’ profitability as\na campaign issue against the Conservative Party. In part\nbecause of campaign promises to tax what it characterized\nas undue profits, the Labour Party defeated the Conserva­\ntive Party at the polls in 1997. Prior to coming to power,\nLabour Party leaders hired accounting firm Arthur Ander­\nsen to structure a tax that would capture excess, or “wind­\nfall,” profits earned during the initial years in which the\ncompanies were prohibited from increasing rates. Par­\nliament eventually adopted the tax, which applied only to\nthe regulated companies that were prohibited from raising\ntheir rates. See Finance (No. 2) Act, 1997, ch. 58, pt. I,\ncls. 1 and 2(5) (Eng.) (U. K. Windfall Tax Act). It imposed\na 23 percent tax on any “windfall” earned by such compa­\nnies. Id., cl. 1(2). A separate schedule “se[t] out how to\nquantify the windfall from which a company was benefit­\nting.” Id., cl. 1(3). See id., sched. 1.\n   In the proceedings below, the parties stipulated that the\nfollowing formula summarizes the tax imposed by the\nLabour Party:\n                                     P\n               Tax = 23%\t ൤൬365 × ൬ ൰ × 9൰ − FV൨\n                                     D\nD equals the number of days a company was subject to\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrate regulation (also known as the “initial period”), P\nequals the total profits earned during the initial period,\nand FV equals the flotation value, or market capitalization\nvalue after sale. For 27 of the 32 companies subject to\nthe tax, the number of days in the initial period was 1,461\ndays (or four years). Of the remaining five companies, one\nhad no tax liability because it did not earn any windfall\nprofits. Three had initial periods close to four years\n(1,463, 1,456, and 1,380 days). The last was privatized\nshortly before the Labour Party took power and had an\ninitial period of only 316 days.\n   The number 9 in the formula was characterized as a\nprice-to-earnings ratio and was selected because it repre­\nsented the lowest average price-to-earnings ratio of the 32\ncompanies subject to the tax during the relevant period.1\nSee id., sched. 1, §1, cl. 2(3); Brief for Respondent 7. The\nstatute expressly set its value, and that value was the\nsame for all companies. U. K. Windfall Tax Act, sched. 1,\n§1, cl. 2(3). The only variables that changed in the wind­\nfall tax formula for all the companies were profits (P) and\nflotation value (FV); the initial period (D) varied for only a\nfew of the companies subject to the tax. The Labour gov­\nernment asserted that the term [365 × (P ⁄ D) × 9] repre­\nsented what the flotation value should have been given the\nassumed price-to-earnings ratio of 9. Thus, it claimed\n(and the Commissioner here reiterates) that the tax was\nsimply a 23 percent tax on the difference between what\nthe companies’ flotation values should have been and what\nthey actually were.\n                        B\n  Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL) was an owner,\n——————\n  1A  price-to-earnings ratio “is defined as the stock price divided by\nannual earnings per share.

COMMISSIONER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthrough a number of subsidiaries, of 25 percent of South\nWestern Electricity plc, 1 of 12 government-owned elec­\ntric companies that were privatized in 1990 and that were\nsubject to the tax. See 135 T. C. 304, 307, App. (2010)\n(diagram of PPL corporate structure in 1997). South\nWestern Electricity’s total U. K. windfall tax burden was\n£90,419,265. In its 1997 federal income-tax return, PPL\nclaimed a credit under §901 for its share of the bill. The\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected\nthe claim, but the Tax Court held that the U. K. wind-\nfall tax was creditable for U. S. tax purposes under §901.\nSee id., at 342. The Third Circuit reversed. 665 F. 3d 60,\n68 (2011). We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to\nresolve a Circuit split concerning the windfall tax’s cred­\nitability under §901. Compare 665 F. 3d, at 68, with\nEntergy Corp. & Affiliated Subsidiaries v. Commissioner,\n683 F. 3d 233, 239 (CA5 2012).\n                               II\n  Internal Revenue Code §901(b)(1) provides that “[i]n the\ncase of . . . a domestic corporation, the amount of any\nincome, war profits, and excess profits taxes paid or ac­\ncrued during the taxable year to any foreign country or to\nany possession of the United States” shall be creditable.2\nUnder relevant Treasury Regulations, “[a] foreign levy is\nan income tax if and only if . . . [t]he predominant charac­\nter of that tax is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.”\n26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1). The parties agree that Treasury\nRegulation §1.901–2 applies to this case. That regulation\ncodifies longstanding doctrine dating back to Biddle v.\n——————\n  2 Prior to enactment of what is now §901, income earned overseas was\n\nsubject to taxes not only in the foreign country but also in the United\nStates. See Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U. S. 1, 7 (1932). The\nrelevant text making “income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes”\ncreditable has not changed since 1918. See Revenue Act of 1918,\n§§222(a)(1), 238(a), 40 Stat. 1073, 1080.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCommissioner, 302 U. S. 573, 578–579 (1938), and pro­\nvides the relevant legal standard.\n   The regulation establishes several principles relevant to\nour inquiry. First, the “predominant character” of a tax,\nor the normal manner in which a tax applies, is control­\nling. See id., at 579 (“We are here concerned only with\nthe ‘standard’ or normal tax”). Under this principle, a for­\neign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess\nprofits tax in most instances is creditable, even if it may\naffect a handful of taxpayers differently. Creditability is\nan all or nothing proposition. As the Treasury Regula­\ntions confirm, “a tax either is or is not an income tax, in its\nentirety, for all persons subject to the tax.” 26 CFR\n§1.901–2(a)(1).\n   Second, the way a foreign government characterizes its\ntax is not dispositive with respect to the U. S. creditability\nanalysis. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii) (foreign tax creditable if\npredominantly “an income tax in the U. S. sense”). In\nBiddle, the Court considered the creditability of certain\nU. K. taxes on stock dividends under the substantively\nidentical predecessor to §901. The Court recognized that\n“there is nothing in [the statute’s] language to suggest\nthat in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a\nshifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign\ncharacterizations and classifications of tax legislation.”\n302 U. S., at 578–579. See also United States v. Goodyear\nTire & Rubber Co., 493 U. S. 132, 145 (1989) (noting in\ninterpreting 26 U. S. C. §902 that Biddle is particularly\napplicable “where a contrary interpretation would leave”\ntax interpretation “to the varying tax policies of foreign\ntax authorities”); Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U. S. 271, 279, and\nn. 7 (1938) (state-law definitions generally not controlling\nin federal tax context). Instead of the foreign govern­\nment’s characterization of the tax, the crucial inquiry is\nthe tax’s economic effect. See Biddle, supra, at 579 (in­\nquiry is “whether [a tax] is the substantial equivalent of\n6                   PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment of the tax as those terms are used in our own\nstatute”). In other words, foreign tax creditability depends\non whether the tax, if enacted in the U. S., would be an\nincome, war profits, or excess profits tax.\n   Giving further form to these principles, Treasury Regu­\nlation §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s pre­\ndominant character is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . .\nthe foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal\ncircumstances in which it applies.” The regulation then\nsets forth three tests for assessing whether a foreign tax\nreaches net gain. A tax does so if, “judged on the basis of\nits predominant character, [it] satisfies each of the realiza­\ntion, gross receipts, and net income requirements set forth\nin paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this\nsection.” §1.901–2(b)(1).3 The tests indicate that net gain\n(also referred to as net income) consists of realized gross\nreceipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attrib­\nutable to such gross receipts. A foreign tax that reaches\n\n——————\n   3 The relevant provisions provide as follows:\n\n“A foreign tax satisfies the realization requirement if, judged on the\nbasis of its predominant character, it is imposed—(A) Upon or subse­\nquent to the occurrence of events (‘realization events’) that would result\nin the realization of income under the income tax provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code.” 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(2)(i).\n    “A foreign tax satisfies the gross receipts requirement if, judged on the\nbasis of its predominant character, it is imposed on the basis of—(A)\nGross receipts; or (B) Gross receipts computed under a method that is\nlikely to produce an amount that is not greater than fair market value.”\n§1.901–2(b)(3)(i).\n    “A foreign tax satisfies the net income requirement if, judged on the\nbasis of its predominant character, the base of the tax is computed by\nreducing gross receipts . . . to permit—(A) Recovery of the significant\ncosts and expenses (including significant capital expenditures) at­\ntributable, under reasonable principles, to such gross receipts; or (B)\nRecovery of such significant costs and expenses computed under a\nmethod that is likely to produce an amount that approximates, or is\ngreater than, recovery of such significant costs and expenses.” §1.901–\n2(b)(4)(i).\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

K.’s “windfall tax” formula. See Brief for Respondent\n23 (“The windfall tax takes into account a company’s prof­\nits during its four-year initial period”). Indeed, annual\nprofit is a variable in the tax formula. U. K. Windfall Tax\nAct, sched. 1, §1, cls. 2(2) and 5. It is also undisputed that\nthere is no meaningful difference for our purposes in the\naccounting principles by which the U. K. and the U. S.\ncalculate profits. See Brief for Petitioners 47. The dis­\nagreement instead centers on how to characterize the tax\nformula the Labour Party adopted.\n   The Third Circuit, following the Commissioner’s lead,\nbelieved it could look no further than the tax formula that\nthe Parliament enacted and the way in which the Labour\ngovernment characterized it. Under that view, the wind­\nfall tax must be considered a tax on the difference between\na company’s flotation value (the total amount investors\npaid for the company when the government sold it) and\nan imputed “profit-making value,” defined as a company’s\n“average annual profit during its ‘initial period’ . . . times\n9, the assumed price-to-earnings ratio.” 665 F. 3d, at 65.\nSo characterized, the tax captures a portion of the differ­\nence between the price at which each company was sold\nand the price at which the Labour government believed\neach company should have been sold given the actual\nprofits earned during the initial period. Relying on this\ncharacterization, the Third Circuit believed the windfall\ntax failed at least the Treasury Regulation’s realization\nand gross receipts tests because it reached some artificial\nform of valuation instead of profits. See id., at 67, and\nn. 3.\n   In contrast, PPL’s position is that the substance of the\n8               PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwindfall tax is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.\nWhile recognizing that the tax ostensibly is based on the\ndifference between two values, it argues that every “vari­\nable” in the windfall tax formula except for profits and\nflotation value is fixed (at least with regard to 27 of the 32\ncompanies). PPL emphasizes that the only way the La­\nbour government was able to calculate the imputed “profit­\nmaking value” at which it claimed companies should have\nbeen privatized was by looking after the fact at the actual\nprofits earned by each company. In PPL’s view, it matters\nnot how the U. K. chose to arrange the formula or what it\nclaimed to be taxing, because a tax based on profits above\nsome threshold is an excess profits tax, regardless of how\nit is mathematically arranged or what labels foreign law\nplaces on it. PPL, thus, contends that the windfall taxes it\npaid meet the Treasury Regulation’s tests and are credit­\nable under §901.\n   We agree with PPL and conclude that the predominant\ncharacter of the windfall tax is that of an excess profits\ntax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. It is\nimportant to note that the Labour government’s concep­\ntion of “profit-making value” as a backward-looking analy­\nsis of historic profits is not a recognized valuation method;\ninstead, it is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed\nprice-to-earnings ratio. At trial, one of PPL’s expert wit­\nnesses explained that “ ‘9 is not an accurate P/E multiple,\nand it is not applied to current or expected future earn­\nings.’ ” 135 T. C., at 326, n. 17 (quoting testimony). In­\nstead, the windfall tax is a tax on realized net income\ndisguised as a tax on the difference between two values,\none of which is completely fictitious.

For 27 of the 32 companies subject to the windfall\ntax, the number of days was identical, 1,461 (or four\nyears). Inserting that amount for D in the formula yields\nthe following:\n                (365 × 9 × 23%)                 1,461\n\n         Tax = ൤               ൨ × ൜P − ൤FV ×           \t൨ൠ\n\n                     1,461                    (365 × 9)\nSimplifying the formula by multiplying and dividing num­\nbers reduces the formula to:\n                                   FV\n            Tax = 51.71% × ൤P − \t ൬ ൰ × 4.0027൨\n                                    9\nAs noted, FV represents the value at which each company\nwas privatized.

That multiplication yields the formula in the\n    ୈ       (ଷ଺ହ×ଽ)\ntext.\n10              PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neconomic effect is to convert flotation value into the profits\na company should have earned given the assumed price­\nto-earnings ratio. See 135 T. C., at 327 (“ ‘In effect, the\nway the tax works is to say that the amount of profits\nyou’re allowed in any year before you’re subject to tax is\nequal to one-ninth of the flotation price. After that, profits\nare deemed excess, and there is a tax’ ” (quoting testimony\nfrom the treasurer of South Western Electricity plc)). The\nannual profits are then multiplied by 4.0027, giving the\ntotal “acceptable” profits (as opposed to windfall profit)\nthat each company’s flotation value entitled it to earn\nduring the initial period given the artificial price-to­\nearnings ratio of 9. This fictitious amount is finally sub­\ntracted from actual profits, yielding the excess profits,\nwhich were taxed at an effective rate of 51.71 percent.\n   The rearranged tax formula demonstrates that the\nwindfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference\nbetween the profits each company actually earned and the\namount the Labour government believed it should have\nearned given its flotation value. For the 27 companies\nthat had 1,461-day initial periods, the U. K. tax formula’s\nsubstantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all\nprofits earned above a threshold. That is a classic excess\nprofits tax. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1917, ch. 159, Tit. II,\n§201, 39 Stat. 1000 (8 percent tax imposed on excess prof­\nits exceeding the sum of $5,000 plus 8 percent of invested\ncapital).\n   Of course, other algebraic reformulations of the windfall\ntax equation are possible. See 665 F. 3d, at 66; Brief for\nAnne Alstott et al. as Amici Curiae 21–23 (Alstott Brief).\nThe point of the reformulation is not that it yields a par­\nticular percentage (51.75 percent for most of the compa­\nnies). Rather, the algebraic reformulations illustrate the\neconomic substance of the tax and its interrelationship\nwith net income.\n   The Commissioner argues that any algebraic rear­\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrangement is improper, asserting that U. S. courts must\ntake the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever\ntax base the foreign tax purports to adopt. Brief for Re­\nspondent 28. As a result, the Commissioner claims that\nthe analysis begins and ends with the Labour govern­\nment’s choice to characterize its tax base as the difference\nbetween “profit-making value” and flotation value. Such a\nrigid construction is unwarranted. It cannot be squared\nwith the black-letter principle that “tax law deals in eco­\nnomic realities, not legal abstractions.” Commissioner v.\nSouthwest Exploration Co., 350 U. S. 308, 315 (1956).\nGiven the artificiality of the U. K.’s method of calculating\npurported “value,” we follow substance over form and\nrecognize that the windfall tax is nothing more than a tax\non actual profits above a threshold.\n                              B\n   We find the Commissioner’s other arguments unpersua­\nsive as well. First, the Commissioner attempts to buttress\nthe argument that the windfall tax is a tax on value by\nnoting that some U. S. gift and estate taxes use actual,\npast profits to estimate value. Brief for Respondent 17–18\n(citing 26 CFR §20.2031–3 (2012) and 26 U. S. C. §2032A).\nThis argument misses the point. In the case of valuation\nfor gift and estate taxes, past income may be used to esti­\nmate future income streams. But, it is future revenue­\nearning potential, reduced to market value, that is subject\nto taxation. The windfall profits tax, by contrast, undis­\nputedly taxed past, realized net income alone.\n   The Commissioner contends that the U. K. was not\ntrying to establish valuation as of the 1997 date on which\nthe windfall tax was enacted but instead was attempting\nto derive a proper flotation valuation as of each company’s\nflotation date. Brief for Respondent 21. The Commissioner\nasserts that there was no need to estimate future in-\ncome (as in the case of the gift or estate recipient) because\n12              PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactual revenue numbers for the privatized companies were\navailable. Ibid. That argument also misses the mark. It\nis true, of course, that the companies might have been\nprivatized at higher flotation values had the government\nrecognized how efficient—and thus how profitable—the\ncompanies would become. But, the windfall tax requires\nan underlying concept of value (based on actual ex post\nearnings) that would be alien to any valuer. Taxing ac­\ntual, realized net income in hindsight is not the same as\nconsidering past income for purposes of estimating future\nearning potential.\n   The Commissioner’s reliance on Example 3 to the\nTreasury Regulation’s gross receipts test is also misplaced.\nId., at 37–38; 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(3)(ii), Ex. 3. That ex­\nample posits a petroleum tax in which “gross receipts from\nextraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the\nfair market value of petroleum extracted. This computa­\ntion is designed to produce an amount that is greater than\nthe fair market value of actual gross receipts.” Ibid.\nUnder the example, a tax based on inflated gross receipts\nis not creditable.\n   The Third Circuit believed that the same type of alge­\nbraic rearrangement used above could also be used to\nrearrange a tax imposed on Example 3. It hypothesized:\n     “Say that the tax rate on the hypothetical extraction\n     tax is 20%. It is true that a 20% tax on 105% of re­\n     ceipts is mathematically equivalent to a 21% tax on\n     100% of receipts, the latter of which would satisfy the\n     gross receipts requirement. PPL proposes that we\n     make the same move here, increasing the tax rate\n     from 23% to 51.75% so that there is no multiple of re­\n     ceipts in the tax base. But if the regulation allowed\n     us to do that, the example would be a nullity. Any tax\n     on a multiple of receipts or profits could satisfy the\n     gross receipts requirement, because we could reduce\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

Brief for Respondent 37–38.\n   There are three basic problems with this approach. As\nthe Fifth Circuit correctly recognized, there is a difference\nbetween imputed and actual receipts. “Example 3 hypoth­\nesizes a tax on the extraction of petroleum where the\nincome value of the petroleum is deemed to be . . . deliber­\nately greater than actual gross receipts.” Entergy Corp.,\n683 F. 3d, at 238. In contrast, the windfall tax depends\non actual figures. Ibid. (“There was no need to calculate\nimputed gross receipts; gross receipts were actually\nknown”). Example 3 simply addresses a different foreign\ntaxation issue.\n   The argument also incorrectly equates imputed gross\nreceipts under Example 3 with net income. See 665 F. 3d,\nat 67 (“[a]ny tax on a multiple of receipts or profits”). As\nnoted, a tax is creditable only if it applies to realized gross\nreceipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attribut-\nable to such gross receipts. 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(4)(i). A\ntax based solely on gross receipts (like the Third Circuit’s\nanalysis) would be noncreditable because it would fail the\nTreasury Regulation’s net income requirement.\n   Finally, even if expenses were subtracted from imputed\ngross receipts before a tax was imposed, the effect of in­\nflating only gross receipts would be to inflate revenue\nwhile holding expenses (the other component of net in­\ncome) constant. A tax imposed on inflated income minus\nactual expenses is not the same as a tax on net income.5\n——————\n  5 Mathematically, the Third Circuit’s hypothetical was incomplete. It\nshould have been:\n            20% [ 105% (Gross Receipts) − Expenses ] = Tax\nBut 105% of gross receipts minus expenses is not net income. Thus, the\n14                 PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  For these reasons, a tax based on imputed gross receipts\nis not creditable. But, as the Fifth Circuit explained in\nrejecting the Third Circuit’s analysis, Example 3 is “faci­\nally irrelevant” to the analysis of the U. K. windfall tax,\nwhich is based on true net income. Entergy Corp., supra,\nat 238.6\n                         *     *    *\n   The economic substance of the U. K. windfall tax is that\nof a U. S. income tax. The tax is based on net income, and\nthe fact that the Labour government chose to characterize\nit as a tax on the difference between two values is not\ndispositive under Treasury Regulation §1.901–2. There­\nfore, the tax is creditable under §901.\n   The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n20% tax is not a tax on net income and is not creditable.\n  6 An amici brief argues that because two companies had initial peri­\n\nods substantially shorter than four years, the predominant character of\nthe U. K. windfall tax was not a tax on income in the U. S. sense. See\nAlstott Brief 29 (discussing Railtrack Group plc and British Energy\nplc). The argument amounts to a claim that two outliers changed the\npredominant character of the U. K. tax. See 135 T. C. 304, 340, n. 33\n(2010) (rejecting this view).\n  The Commissioner admitted at oral argument that it did not preserve\nthis argument, a fact reflected in its briefing before this Court and in\nthe Third Circuit. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36; Opening Brief for Appel­\nlant and Reply Brief for Appellant in No. 11–1069 (CA3). We therefore\nexpress no view on its merits.\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

S. C. §901(b)(1) depends on\ntwo interrelated analytic moves: first, restricting the “predom-\ninant character” analysis to those companies that shared an\n“initial period” of rate regulation of 1,461 days; and second,\ntreating the tax’s initial period variable as fixed. See ante,\nat 9–10. But there is a different way of looking at this\ncase. If the predominant character inquiry is expanded to\ninclude      the     five   companies       that     had     dif-\nferent initial periods, especially those with much shorter\ninitial periods, it becomes impossible to rewrite the wind-\nfall tax as an excess profits tax. Instead, it becomes clear\nthat the windfall tax is functionally a tax on value. But\nbecause the Government took the position at oral argu-\nment that the predominant character inquiry should\ndisregard such “outlie[r]” companies, see Tr. of Oral Arg.\n38–39, and this argument is therefore only pressed by\namici, Brief for Anne Alstott et al. as Amici Curiae 28–30\n(hereinafter Alstott Brief), I reserve consideration of this\nargument for another day and another context and join\nthe Court’s opinion.\n                     *    *    *\n  The Internal Revenue Code provides that “income, war\n2                  PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nprofits, and excess profits taxes” paid to a foreign country\nare creditable. 26 U. S. C. §901(b)(1). Whether a foreign\ntax falls within one of these categories depends on whether\nits “predominant character . . . is that of an income tax\nin the U. S. sense.” 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii) (2010). As\nthe Court explains, there are three components to this in-\nquiry, ante, at 4–7, but at its core the inquiry simply asks\nwhether a foreign tax resembles a typical income, war\nprofits, or excess profits tax, ante, at 6.\n   Importantly, though, the relevant Treasury Regulations\nalso provide that a foreign tax “is or is not an income tax,\nin its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax.” 26 CFR\n§1.901–2(a)(1). One way to understand this language is\nthat for a tax to be classed as a creditable income tax,\nits predominant character must be that of an income tax\nwith respect to “all persons subject to the tax.” Of course,\namong the many persons subject to a tax, some may face\ntax burdens different from the majority of affected taxpay-\ners. The challenge in applying predominant character\nanalysis will sometimes lie in determining whether and\nhow such outlier taxpayers affect the characterization of a\ngiven tax.1\n——————\n  1 For example, some taxes may produce outliers that might suggest\n\nthat the tax is not an income tax, when in fact the tax is attempting\nto reach net gain and therefore has the predominant character of an\nincome tax. This situation often arises when a tax relies on imperfect\nestimates and assumptions in attempting to calculate net gain. Such a\ntax strives to treat similarly situated taxpayers the same but fails to do\nso only because the estimated component inadvertently affects some\ntaxpayers differently. A situation of this kind occurred in Texasgulf,\nInc. v. Commissioner, 172 F. 3d 209 (CA2 1999). In that case, a Cana-\ndian mining tax did not permit taxpayers to deduct their specific\nexpenses, but did permit them to deduct a fixed “processing allowance.”\nId., at 211–213. The taxpayer argued that the tax was creditable\nbecause the processing allowance was an attempt to reach net income,\ngross income minus expenses, by using “ ‘a method that is likely to\nproduce an amount that approximates, or is greater than, recovery of\nsuch significant costs and expenditures.’ ” Id., at 215 (quoting 26 CFR\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

Because an excess profits tax is generally\na tax levied on the profits of a business beyond a particu-\nlar threshold, see Wells, Legislative History of Excess\nProfits Taxation in the United States in World Wars I and\nII, 4 Nat. Tax J. 237, 243 (1951), it appears to follow that\nthe windfall tax can properly be characterized as an excess\nprofits tax.\n   But not all of the 32 affected companies had an initial\n——————\n§1.901–2(b)(4)(i)(B) (1999)). To support its argument, the taxpayer\nintroduced empirical evidence that roughly 85% of companies facing\nmining tax liability had nonrecoverable expenses less than the pro-\ncessing allowance. Texasgulf, Inc., 172 F. 3d, at 215–216. The Court of\nAppeals agreed with the taxpayer that the tax was a creditable income\ntax because it was clear that the mining tax was attempting to reach\nnet income, albeit by using an estimate to calculate deductions. Id.,\nat 216–217. This result is sensible: A company that happens to have\ndeductible expenses greater than the fixed amount set by the pro-\ncessing allowance is not an instructive outlier regarding the mining\ntaxes predominant character. The mining tax is attempting to reach\nthat company’s net income, but fails to do only because it relies on an\napproximate value for deductions.\n4                  PPL CORP. v.

When these\ndifferent initial period values are inserted into the formu-\nlation proposed by PPL, two results follow. First, these\ncompanies have tax rates different from the 51.71% rate\nthe Court calculates for the 27 other companies. Second,\ntheir excess profits threshold also varies.\n  For example, consider Railtrack Group, a clear outlier\nwith an initial period of 316 days. Inserting this value\ninto the stipulated formula yields the following:\n                                         ܲ\n              ܶܽ‫ × %32 = ݔ‬൤൬365\n×           × 9൰ − ‫ ܸܨ‬൨\n                                        316\nApplying the Court’s algebra, this formula can be reduced\nto the following: ܴ݈ܽ݅‫− ܲ[ × %01.932 = ݔܽܶ ݏ’݌ݑ݋ݎܩ ݇ܿܽݎݐ‬\n(9.62% × ‫ \n .]) ܸܨ‬Railtrack Group’s “effective” tax rate and\nits excess profits threshold (239.10% and 9.62% respec-\ntively) are very different from those companies with the\ncommon initial period length of 1,461 days (51.71% and\n44.47%).

In contrast, here both of the rate and\nthreshold components vary from company to company\naccording to the D variable.3\n   Seen through this lens, the windfall tax is really a tax\non average profits. See Alstott Brief 28–30. Under the\nparties’ stipulated form of the windfall tax, each company\npays a fixed tax rate of 23% on a base that is calculated by\nfirst multiplying a company’s daily average profits during\nits initial period (i.e.,\t(\n ‫ ,\n)ܦ‬or total profits over the initial\n                           ܲ/\nperiod divided by the length of the initial period) by a fixed\nprice-to-earnings ratio; and then subtracting that com-\npany’s flotation value (‫ .) ܸܨ‬See ante, at 2. In practice, this\nmeans that, for example, a company that earns $100\nmillion over 1,461 days would pay approximately the same\namount of taxes as a company that has earned $25 million\nover 365 days. These two companies would have almost\nthe same average profits. See Alstott Brief 28. This is not\nhow an income tax works.\n   The difference between a tax on profits and tax on aver-\nage profits is especially significant for properly character-\nizing a tax such as the windfall tax. Average daily profits\nmultiplied by a price-to-earnings ratio, rather than being a\n——————\n  3 At oral argument, PPL contended that an excess profits tax in which\n\nthe excess profits threshold varies according to market capitalization\nwould also have an effective tax rate that varies across taxpayers but\nremains creditable. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27. That might be true, but\nthat does not describe the situation here. In PPL’s hypothetical, any\nshift in the effective tax rate depends on the profits threshold; Here,\nunder PPL’s version of the windfall tax, both the effective tax rate and\nthe profits threshold move proportionately to a company’s initial period\nlength.\n6                  PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nway of approximating income, is a way of approximating\nvalue.4 See Thompson, A Lawyer’s Guide to Modern Val-\nuation Techniques in Mergers and Acquisitions, 21 J.\nCorp. L. 457, 532–533 (1996) (describing similar valuation\ntechniques using price-to-earnings ratios). Accordingly,\nincorporating an outlier like Railtrack Group into the\npredominant character analysis suggests that the windfall\ntax is a tax on a company’s value. Railtrack Group and\nthe companies like it are not random outliers, Brief for\nPetitioners 38, n. 3, but instead are critical pieces of data\nfor understanding how the tax actually functioned as a\nmatter of “economic realit[y].” Commissioner v. Southwest\nExploration Co., 350 U. S. 308, 315 (1956).\n  This argument, however, rests on the premise that\nbecause the relevant regulations state that “a tax either is\nor is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons\nsubject to the tax,” 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii), a tax’s pre-\ndominant character must be as an income tax for all tax-\npayers. But if a tax only needs to be an income tax for\n“a substantial number of taxpayers” and does not have to\n“satisfy the predominant character test in its application\nto all taxpayers,” Exxon Corp. v. Commissioner, 113 T. C.\n338, 352 (1999), then this average profits argument cannot\nget off the ground. Under this reading, the regulations tell\ncourts to treat outliers like Railtrack Group as flukes.\n  At oral argument, the Government apparently rejected\nthe notion that “outliers” like Railtrack Group are relevant\nto creditability analysis. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–39. The\nGovernment also did not argue these outliers’ relevance\n——————\n   4 Petitioners suggested at oral argument that because some of the\n\noutlier taxpayers may have been subject to a more favorable regulatory\nregime in the wake of their privatization, their outsized tax rates are\nless meaningful because they could recoup their windfall tax burdens.\nSee id., at 16–17.

Argued February 20, 2013—Decided May 20, 2013\nIn 1997, the United Kingdom (U. K.), newly under Labour Party rule,\n  imposed a one-time “windfall tax” on 32 U. K. companies privatized\n  between 1984 and 1996 by the Conservative government. The com-\n  panies had been sold to private parties through an initial sale of\n  shares, known as a “flotation.” Some of the companies were required\n  to continue providing services for a fixed period at the same rates\n  they had offered under government control. Many of those companies\n  became dramatically more efficient and earned substantial profits in\n  the process.\n     Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL), part owner of a privatized U. K.\n  company subject to the windfall tax, claimed a credit for its share of\n  the bill in its 1997 federal income-tax return, relying on Internal\n  Revenue Code §901(b)(1), which states that any “income, war profits,\n  and excess profits taxes” paid overseas are creditable against U. S.\n  income taxes. Treasury Regulation §1.901–2(a)(1) interprets this sec-\n  tion to mean that a foreign tax is creditable if its “predominant char-\n  acter” “is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.” The Commission-\n  er of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected PPL’s claim, but the\n  Tax Court held that the U. K. windfall tax was creditable for U. S.\n  tax purposes under §901. The Third Circuit reversed.\nHeld: The U. K. tax is creditable under §901. Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) Treasury Regulation §1.901–2, which codifies longstanding doc-\n trine dating back to Biddle v. Commissioner, 302 U. S. 573, 578–579\n (1938), provides the relevant legal standard. First, a tax’s “predomi-\n nant character,” or the normal manner in which a tax applies, is con-\n trolling. See id., at 579. Thus, a foreign tax that operates as an in-\n come, war profits, or excess profits tax for most taxpayers is generally\n2                     PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    creditable. Second, foreign tax creditability depends not on the way a\n    foreign government characterizes its tax but on whether the tax, if\n    enacted in the U. S., would be an income, war profits, or excess prof-\n    its tax. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii). Giving further form to these princi-\n    ples, §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s predominant char-\n    acter is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . . the foreign tax is likely to\n    reach net gain in the normal circumstances in which it applies.”\n    Three tests set forth in the regulations provide guidance in making\n    this assessment, see §1.901–2(b)(1). The tests indicate that net gain\n    consists of realized gross receipts reduced by significant costs and ex-\n    penses attributable to such gross receipts, in combination known as\n    net income. A foreign tax that reaches net income, or profits, is cred-\n    itable. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The U. K. windfall tax’s predominant character is that of an ex-\n    cess profits tax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. The La-\n    bour government’s conception of “profit-making value” as a backward-\n    looking analysis of historic profits is not a typical valuation\n    method. Rather, it is a tax on realized net income disguised as a\n    tax on the difference between two values, one of which is a fictitious\n    value calculated using an imputed price-to-earnings ratio. The sub-\n    stance of the windfall tax confirms this conclusion. When rear-\n    ranged, the U. K’s formula demonstrates that the windfall tax is eco-\n    nomically equivalent to the difference between the profits each\n    company actually earned and the amount the Labour government be-\n    lieved it should have earned given its flotation value. For most of the\n    relevant companies, the U. K. formula’s substantive effect was to im-\n    pose a 51.71 percent tax on all profits above a threshold, a classic ex-\n    cess profits tax. The Commissioner claims that any algebraic rear-\n    rangement is improper because U. S. courts must take the foreign tax\n    rate as written and accept whatever tax base the foreign tax purports\n    to adopt. But such a rigid construction cannot be squared with the\n    black-letter principle that “tax law deals in economic realities, not le-\n    gal abstractions.” Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 350\n    U. S. 308, 315. Given the artificiality of the U. K.’s calculation meth-\n    od, this Court follows substance over form and recognizes that the\n    windfall tax is nothing more than a tax on actual profits above a\n    threshold. Pp. 7–11.\n       (c) The Commissioner’s additional arguments in support of his po-\n    sition are similarly unpersuasive.

K.) imposed a one-time\n“windfall tax” on 32 U. K. companies privatized between\n1984 and 1996. This case addresses whether that tax\nis creditable for U. S. tax purposes. Internal Revenue Code\n§901(b)(1) states that any “income, war profits, and excess\nprofits taxes” paid overseas are creditable against U. S.\nincome taxes. 26 U. S. C. §901(b)(1). Treasury Regula­\ntions interpret this section to mean that a foreign tax is\ncreditable if its “predominant character” “is that of an\nincome tax in the U. S. sense.” Treas. Reg. §1.901–\n2(a)(1)(ii), 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1) (1992). Consistent with\nprecedent and the Tax Court’s analysis below, we apply\nthe predominant character test using a commonsense\napproach that considers the substantive effect of the tax.\nUnder this approach, we hold that the U. K. tax is credit­\nable under §901 and reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit.\n                          I\n                          A\n  During the 1980’s and 1990’s, the U. K.’s Conservative\n2                PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParty controlled Parliament and privatized a number of\ngovernment-owned companies. These companies were\nsold to private parties through an initial sale of shares,\nknown as a “flotation.” As part of privatization, many com­\npanies were required to continue providing services at the\nsame rates they had offered under government control\nfor a fixed period, typically their first four years of private\noperation. As a result, the companies could only increase\nprofits during this period by operating more efficiently.\nResponding to market incentives, many of the companies\nbecame dramatically more efficient and earned substantial\nprofits in the process.\n   The U. K.’s Labour Party, which had unsuccessfully\nopposed privatization, used the companies’ profitability as\na campaign issue against the Conservative Party. In part\nbecause of campaign promises to tax what it characterized\nas undue profits, the Labour Party defeated the Conserva­\ntive Party at the polls in 1997. Prior to coming to power,\nLabour Party leaders hired accounting firm Arthur Ander­\nsen to structure a tax that would capture excess, or “wind­\nfall,” profits earned during the initial years in which the\ncompanies were prohibited from increasing rates. Par­\nliament eventually adopted the tax, which applied only to\nthe regulated companies that were prohibited from raising\ntheir rates. See Finance (No. 2) Act, 1997, ch. 58, pt. I,\ncls. 1 and 2(5) (Eng.) (U. K. Windfall Tax Act). It imposed\na 23 percent tax on any “windfall” earned by such compa­\nnies. Id., cl. 1(2).

See id., sched. 1.\n   In the proceedings below, the parties stipulated that the\nfollowing formula summarizes the tax imposed by the\nLabour Party:\n                                     P\n               Tax = 23%\t ൤൬365 × ൬ ൰ × 9൰ − FV൨\n                                     D\nD equals the number of days a company was subject to\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

For 27 of the 32 companies subject to\nthe tax, the number of days in the initial period was 1,461\ndays (or four years). Of the remaining five companies, one\nhad no tax liability because it did not earn any windfall\nprofits. Three had initial periods close to four years\n(1,463, 1,456, and 1,380 days). The last was privatized\nshortly before the Labour Party took power and had an\ninitial period of only 316 days.\n   The number 9 in the formula was characterized as a\nprice-to-earnings ratio and was selected because it repre­\nsented the lowest average price-to-earnings ratio of the 32\ncompanies subject to the tax during the relevant period.1\nSee id., sched. 1, §1, cl. 2(3); Brief for Respondent 7. The\nstatute expressly set its value, and that value was the\nsame for all companies. U. K. Windfall Tax Act, sched. 1,\n§1, cl. 2(3). The only variables that changed in the wind­\nfall tax formula for all the companies were profits (P) and\nflotation value (FV); the initial period (D) varied for only a\nfew of the companies subject to the tax. The Labour gov­\nernment asserted that the term [365 × (P ⁄ D) × 9] repre­\nsented what the flotation value should have been given the\nassumed price-to-earnings ratio of 9. Thus, it claimed\n(and the Commissioner here reiterates) that the tax was\nsimply a 23 percent tax on the difference between what\nthe companies’ flotation values should have been and what\nthey actually were.\n                        B\n  Petitioner PPL Corporation (PPL) was an owner,\n——————\n  1A  price-to-earnings ratio “is defined as the stock price divided by\nannual earnings per share.

In its 1997 federal income-tax return, PPL\nclaimed a credit under §901 for its share of the bill. The\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) rejected\nthe claim, but the Tax Court held that the U. K. wind-\nfall tax was creditable for U. S. tax purposes under §901.\nSee id., at 342. The Third Circuit reversed. 665 F. 3d 60,\n68 (2011). We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to\nresolve a Circuit split concerning the windfall tax’s cred­\nitability under §901.

[t]he predominant charac­\nter of that tax is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.”\n26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1). The parties agree that Treasury\nRegulation §1.901–2 applies to this case. That regulation\ncodifies longstanding doctrine dating back to Biddle v.\n——————\n  2 Prior to enactment of what is now §901, income earned overseas was\n\nsubject to taxes not only in the foreign country but also in the United\nStates. See Burnet v. Chicago Portrait Co., 285 U. S. 1, 7 (1932). The\nrelevant text making “income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes”\ncreditable has not changed since 1918.

S. 573, 578–579 (1938), and pro­\nvides the relevant legal standard.\n   The regulation establishes several principles relevant to\nour inquiry. First, the “predominant character” of a tax,\nor the normal manner in which a tax applies, is control­\nling. See id., at 579 (“We are here concerned only with\nthe ‘standard’ or normal tax”). Under this principle, a for­\neign tax that operates as an income, war profits, or excess\nprofits tax in most instances is creditable, even if it may\naffect a handful of taxpayers differently. Creditability is\nan all or nothing proposition. As the Treasury Regula­\ntions confirm, “a tax either is or is not an income tax, in its\nentirety, for all persons subject to the tax.” 26 CFR\n§1.901–2(a)(1).\n   Second, the way a foreign government characterizes its\ntax is not dispositive with respect to the U. S. creditability\nanalysis. See §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii) (foreign tax creditable if\npredominantly “an income tax in the U. S. sense”). In\nBiddle, the Court considered the creditability of certain\nU. K. taxes on stock dividends under the substantively\nidentical predecessor to §901. The Court recognized that\n“there is nothing in [the statute’s] language to suggest\nthat in allowing the credit for foreign tax payments, a\nshifting standard was adopted by reference to foreign\ncharacterizations and classifications of tax legislation.”\n302 U. S., at 578–579. See also United States v. Goodyear\nTire & Rubber Co., 493 U. S. 132, 145 (1989) (noting in\ninterpreting 26 U. S. C. §902 that Biddle is particularly\napplicable “where a contrary interpretation would leave”\ntax interpretation “to the varying tax policies of foreign\ntax authorities”); Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U. S. 271, 279, and\nn. 7 (1938) (state-law definitions generally not controlling\nin federal tax context). Instead of the foreign govern­\nment’s characterization of the tax, the crucial inquiry is\nthe tax’s economic effect. See Biddle, supra, at 579 (in­\nquiry is “whether [a tax] is the substantial equivalent of\n6                   PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\npayment of the tax as those terms are used in our own\nstatute”). In other words, foreign tax creditability depends\non whether the tax, if enacted in the U. S., would be an\nincome, war profits, or excess profits tax.\n   Giving further form to these principles, Treasury Regu­\nlation §1.901–2(a)(3)(i) explains that a foreign tax’s pre­\ndominant character is that of a U. S. income tax “[i]f . . .\nthe foreign tax is likely to reach net gain in the normal\ncircumstances in which it applies.” The regulation then\nsets forth three tests for assessing whether a foreign tax\nreaches net gain. A tax does so if, “judged on the basis of\nits predominant character, [it] satisfies each of the realiza­\ntion, gross receipts, and net income requirements set forth\nin paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this\nsection.” §1.901–2(b)(1).3 The tests indicate that net gain\n(also referred to as net income) consists of realized gross\nreceipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attrib­\nutable to such gross receipts.

The dis­\nagreement instead centers on how to characterize the tax\nformula the Labour Party adopted.\n   The Third Circuit, following the Commissioner’s lead,\nbelieved it could look no further than the tax formula that\nthe Parliament enacted and the way in which the Labour\ngovernment characterized it. Under that view, the wind­\nfall tax must be considered a tax on the difference between\na company’s flotation value (the total amount investors\npaid for the company when the government sold it) and\nan imputed “profit-making value,” defined as a company’s\n“average annual profit during its ‘initial period’ . . . times\n9, the assumed price-to-earnings ratio.” 665 F. 3d, at 65.\nSo characterized, the tax captures a portion of the differ­\nence between the price at which each company was sold\nand the price at which the Labour government believed\neach company should have been sold given the actual\nprofits earned during the initial period. Relying on this\ncharacterization, the Third Circuit believed the windfall\ntax failed at least the Treasury Regulation’s realization\nand gross receipts tests because it reached some artificial\nform of valuation instead of profits. See id., at 67, and\nn. 3.\n   In contrast, PPL’s position is that the substance of the\n8               PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwindfall tax is that of an income tax in the U. S. sense.\nWhile recognizing that the tax ostensibly is based on the\ndifference between two values, it argues that every “vari­\nable” in the windfall tax formula except for profits and\nflotation value is fixed (at least with regard to 27 of the 32\ncompanies). PPL emphasizes that the only way the La­\nbour government was able to calculate the imputed “profit­\nmaking value” at which it claimed companies should have\nbeen privatized was by looking after the fact at the actual\nprofits earned by each company. In PPL’s view, it matters\nnot how the U. K. chose to arrange the formula or what it\nclaimed to be taxing, because a tax based on profits above\nsome threshold is an excess profits tax, regardless of how\nit is mathematically arranged or what labels foreign law\nplaces on it. PPL, thus, contends that the windfall taxes it\npaid meet the Treasury Regulation’s tests and are credit­\nable under §901.\n   We agree with PPL and conclude that the predominant\ncharacter of the windfall tax is that of an excess profits\ntax, a category of income tax in the U. S. sense. It is\nimportant to note that the Labour government’s concep­\ntion of “profit-making value” as a backward-looking analy­\nsis of historic profits is not a recognized valuation method;\ninstead, it is a fictitious value calculated using an imputed\nprice-to-earnings ratio. At trial, one of PPL’s expert wit­\nnesses explained that “ ‘9 is not an accurate P/E multiple,\nand it is not applied to current or expected future earn­\nings.’ ” 135 T. C., at 326, n. 17 (quoting testimony). In­\nstead, the windfall tax is a tax on realized net income\ndisguised as a tax on the difference between two values,\none of which is completely fictitious. See App. 251, Report\n¶1.7 (“[T]he value in profit making terms described in the\nwording of the act . . . is not a real value: it is rather a\nconstruct based on realised profits that would not have\nbeen known at the date of privatisation”).\n   The substance of the windfall tax confirms the accuracy\n                       Cite as: 569 U.

As already noted, the parties stipulated\nthat the windfall tax could be calculated as follows:\n                                    P\n                Tax = 23%\t ൤൬365 × ൬ ൰ × 9൰ − FV൨\n                                    D\nThis formula can be rearranged algebraically to the follow­\ning formula, which is mathematically and substantively\nidentical:4\n               (365 × 9 × 23%)                  D\n        Tax = ൤               ൨ × ൜P − ൤FV ×           \t൨ൠ\n                      D                      (365 × 9)\nThe next step is to substitute the actual number of days\nfor D. For 27 of the 32 companies subject to the windfall\ntax, the number of days was identical, 1,461 (or four\nyears). Inserting that amount for D in the formula yields\nthe following:\n                (365 × 9 × 23%)                 1,461\n\n         Tax = ൤               ൨ × ൜P − ൤FV ×           \t൨ൠ\n\n                     1,461                    (365 × 9)\nSimplifying the formula by multiplying and dividing num­\nbers reduces the formula to:\n                                   FV\n            Tax = 51.71% × ൤P − \t ൬ ൰ × 4.0027൨\n                                    9\nAs noted, FV represents the value at which each company\nwas privatized.

The\n——————\n  4 The rearrangement requires only basic algebraic manipulation.\n\nFirst, because order of operations does not matter for multiplication\nand division, the formula is rearranged to the following:\n                                              ୔\n                      Tax = 23%\t ቂ൬365 × 9 × ቀୈቁ൰ − FVቃ\n                                                              (ଷ଺ହ×ଽ)\nNext, everything outside the brackets is multiplied by ቂ                ቃ,\tand\n                                                                ୈ\n                                                                        ୈ\neverything inside the brackets is multiplied by the inverse, ቂ(ଷ଺ହ×ଽ)ቃ.\nThe effect is the same as multiplication by the number one (since\n   (ଷ଺ହ×ଽ)       ୈ\nቄቂ         ቃ ×\tቂ   ቃቅ = \t1). That multiplication yields the formula in the\n    ୈ       (ଷ଺ହ×ଽ)\ntext.\n10              PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\neconomic effect is to convert flotation value into the profits\na company should have earned given the assumed price­\nto-earnings ratio. See 135 T. C., at 327 (“ ‘In effect, the\nway the tax works is to say that the amount of profits\nyou’re allowed in any year before you’re subject to tax is\nequal to one-ninth of the flotation price. After that, profits\nare deemed excess, and there is a tax’ ” (quoting testimony\nfrom the treasurer of South Western Electricity plc)). The\nannual profits are then multiplied by 4.0027, giving the\ntotal “acceptable” profits (as opposed to windfall profit)\nthat each company’s flotation value entitled it to earn\nduring the initial period given the artificial price-to­\nearnings ratio of 9. This fictitious amount is finally sub­\ntracted from actual profits, yielding the excess profits,\nwhich were taxed at an effective rate of 51.71 percent.\n   The rearranged tax formula demonstrates that the\nwindfall tax is economically equivalent to the difference\nbetween the profits each company actually earned and the\namount the Labour government believed it should have\nearned given its flotation value. For the 27 companies\nthat had 1,461-day initial periods, the U. K. tax formula’s\nsubstantive effect was to impose a 51.71 percent tax on all\nprofits earned above a threshold. That is a classic excess\nprofits tax. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1917, ch. 159, Tit. II,\n§201, 39 Stat. 1000 (8 percent tax imposed on excess prof­\nits exceeding the sum of $5,000 plus 8 percent of invested\ncapital).\n   Of course, other algebraic reformulations of the windfall\ntax equation are possible. See 665 F. 3d, at 66; Brief for\nAnne Alstott et al. as Amici Curiae 21–23 (Alstott Brief).\nThe point of the reformulation is not that it yields a par­\nticular percentage (51.75 percent for most of the compa­\nnies). Rather, the algebraic reformulations illustrate the\neconomic substance of the tax and its interrelationship\nwith net income.\n   The Commissioner argues that any algebraic rear­\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrangement is improper, asserting that U. S. courts must\ntake the foreign tax rate as written and accept whatever\ntax base the foreign tax purports to adopt. Brief for Re­\nspondent 28. As a result, the Commissioner claims that\nthe analysis begins and ends with the Labour govern­\nment’s choice to characterize its tax base as the difference\nbetween “profit-making value” and flotation value. Such a\nrigid construction is unwarranted. It cannot be squared\nwith the black-letter principle that “tax law deals in eco­\nnomic realities, not legal abstractions.” Commissioner v.\nSouthwest Exploration Co., 350 U. S. 308, 315 (1956).\nGiven the artificiality of the U. K.’s method of calculating\npurported “value,” we follow substance over form and\nrecognize that the windfall tax is nothing more than a tax\non actual profits above a threshold.\n                              B\n   We find the Commissioner’s other arguments unpersua­\nsive as well. First, the Commissioner attempts to buttress\nthe argument that the windfall tax is a tax on value by\nnoting that some U. S. gift and estate taxes use actual,\npast profits to estimate value. Brief for Respondent 17–18\n(citing 26 CFR §20.2031–3 (2012) and 26 U. S. C. §2032A).\nThis argument misses the point. In the case of valuation\nfor gift and estate taxes, past income may be used to esti­\nmate future income streams. But, it is future revenue­\nearning potential, reduced to market value, that is subject\nto taxation. The windfall profits tax, by contrast, undis­\nputedly taxed past, realized net income alone.\n   The Commissioner contends that the U. K. was not\ntrying to establish valuation as of the 1997 date on which\nthe windfall tax was enacted but instead was attempting\nto derive a proper flotation valuation as of each company’s\nflotation date. Brief for Respondent 21. The Commissioner\nasserts that there was no need to estimate future in-\ncome (as in the case of the gift or estate recipient) because\n12              PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactual revenue numbers for the privatized companies were\navailable. Ibid. That argument also misses the mark. It\nis true, of course, that the companies might have been\nprivatized at higher flotation values had the government\nrecognized how efficient—and thus how profitable—the\ncompanies would become. But, the windfall tax requires\nan underlying concept of value (based on actual ex post\nearnings) that would be alien to any valuer. Taxing ac­\ntual, realized net income in hindsight is not the same as\nconsidering past income for purposes of estimating future\nearning potential.\n   The Commissioner’s reliance on Example 3 to the\nTreasury Regulation’s gross receipts test is also misplaced.\nId., at 37–38; 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(3)(ii), Ex. 3. That ex­\nample posits a petroleum tax in which “gross receipts from\nextraction income are deemed to equal 105 percent of the\nfair market value of petroleum extracted. This computa­\ntion is designed to produce an amount that is greater than\nthe fair market value of actual gross receipts.” Ibid.\nUnder the example, a tax based on inflated gross receipts\nis not creditable.\n   The Third Circuit believed that the same type of alge­\nbraic rearrangement used above could also be used to\nrearrange a tax imposed on Example 3. It hypothesized:\n     “Say that the tax rate on the hypothetical extraction\n     tax is 20%. It is true that a 20% tax on 105% of re­\n     ceipts is mathematically equivalent to a 21% tax on\n     100% of receipts, the latter of which would satisfy the\n     gross receipts requirement. PPL proposes that we\n     make the same move here, increasing the tax rate\n     from 23% to 51.75% so that there is no multiple of re­\n     ceipts in the tax base. But if the regulation allowed\n     us to do that, the example would be a nullity. Any tax\n     on a multiple of receipts or profits could satisfy the\n     gross receipts requirement, because we could reduce\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

Brief for Respondent 37–38.\n   There are three basic problems with this approach. As\nthe Fifth Circuit correctly recognized, there is a difference\nbetween imputed and actual receipts. “Example 3 hypoth­\nesizes a tax on the extraction of petroleum where the\nincome value of the petroleum is deemed to be . . . deliber­\nately greater than actual gross receipts.” Entergy Corp.,\n683 F. 3d, at 238. In contrast, the windfall tax depends\non actual figures. Ibid. (“There was no need to calculate\nimputed gross receipts; gross receipts were actually\nknown”). Example 3 simply addresses a different foreign\ntaxation issue.\n   The argument also incorrectly equates imputed gross\nreceipts under Example 3 with net income. See 665 F. 3d,\nat 67 (“[a]ny tax on a multiple of receipts or profits”). As\nnoted, a tax is creditable only if it applies to realized gross\nreceipts reduced by significant costs and expenses attribut-\nable to such gross receipts. 26 CFR §1.901–2(b)(4)(i). A\ntax based solely on gross receipts (like the Third Circuit’s\nanalysis) would be noncreditable because it would fail the\nTreasury Regulation’s net income requirement.\n   Finally, even if expenses were subtracted from imputed\ngross receipts before a tax was imposed, the effect of in­\nflating only gross receipts would be to inflate revenue\nwhile holding expenses (the other component of net in­\ncome) constant. A tax imposed on inflated income minus\nactual expenses is not the same as a tax on net income.5\n——————\n  5 Mathematically, the Third Circuit’s hypothetical was incomplete. It\nshould have been:\n            20% [ 105% (Gross Receipts) − Expenses ] = Tax\nBut 105% of gross receipts minus expenses is not net income. Thus, the\n14                 PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  For these reasons, a tax based on imputed gross receipts\nis not creditable. But, as the Fifth Circuit explained in\nrejecting the Third Circuit’s analysis, Example 3 is “faci­\nally irrelevant” to the analysis of the U. K. windfall tax,\nwhich is based on true net income. Entergy Corp., supra,\nat 238.6\n                         *     *    *\n   The economic substance of the U. K. windfall tax is that\nof a U. S. income tax. The tax is based on net income, and\nthe fact that the Labour government chose to characterize\nit as a tax on the difference between two values is not\ndispositive under Treasury Regulation §1.901–2. There­\nfore, the tax is creditable under §901.\n   The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                                     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n20% tax is not a tax on net income and is not creditable.\n  6 An amici brief argues that because two companies had initial peri­\n\nods substantially shorter than four years, the predominant character of\nthe U. K. windfall tax was not a tax on income in the U. S. sense. See\nAlstott Brief 29 (discussing Railtrack Group plc and British Energy\nplc). The argument amounts to a claim that two outliers changed the\npredominant character of the U. K. tax. See 135 T. C. 304, 340, n. 33\n(2010) (rejecting this view).\n  The Commissioner admitted at oral argument that it did not preserve\nthis argument, a fact reflected in its briefing before this Court and in\nthe Third Circuit. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–36; Opening Brief for Appel­\nlant and Reply Brief for Appellant in No. 11–1069 (CA3). We therefore\nexpress no view on its merits.\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

S. C. §901(b)(1) depends on\ntwo interrelated analytic moves: first, restricting the “predom-\ninant character” analysis to those companies that shared an\n“initial period” of rate regulation of 1,461 days; and second,\ntreating the tax’s initial period variable as fixed. See ante,\nat 9–10. But there is a different way of looking at this\ncase. If the predominant character inquiry is expanded to\ninclude      the     five   companies       that     had     dif-\nferent initial periods, especially those with much shorter\ninitial periods, it becomes impossible to rewrite the wind-\nfall tax as an excess profits tax. Instead, it becomes clear\nthat the windfall tax is functionally a tax on value. But\nbecause the Government took the position at oral argu-\nment that the predominant character inquiry should\ndisregard such “outlie[r]” companies, see Tr. of Oral Arg.\n38–39, and this argument is therefore only pressed by\namici, Brief for Anne Alstott et al. as Amici Curiae 28–30\n(hereinafter Alstott Brief), I reserve consideration of this\nargument for another day and another context and join\nthe Court’s opinion.\n                     *    *    *\n  The Internal Revenue Code provides that “income, war\n2                  PPL CORP. v.

Whether a foreign\ntax falls within one of these categories depends on whether\nits “predominant character . . . is that of an income tax\nin the U. S. sense.” 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii) (2010). As\nthe Court explains, there are three components to this in-\nquiry, ante, at 4–7, but at its core the inquiry simply asks\nwhether a foreign tax resembles a typical income, war\nprofits, or excess profits tax, ante, at 6.\n   Importantly, though, the relevant Treasury Regulations\nalso provide that a foreign tax “is or is not an income tax,\nin its entirety, for all persons subject to the tax.” 26 CFR\n§1.901–2(a)(1). One way to understand this language is\nthat for a tax to be classed as a creditable income tax,\nits predominant character must be that of an income tax\nwith respect to “all persons subject to the tax.” Of course,\namong the many persons subject to a tax, some may face\ntax burdens different from the majority of affected taxpay-\ners. The challenge in applying predominant character\nanalysis will sometimes lie in determining whether and\nhow such outlier taxpayers affect the characterization of a\ngiven tax.1\n——————\n  1 For example, some taxes may produce outliers that might suggest\n\nthat the tax is not an income tax, when in fact the tax is attempting\nto reach net gain and therefore has the predominant character of an\nincome tax. This situation often arises when a tax relies on imperfect\nestimates and assumptions in attempting to calculate net gain. Such a\ntax strives to treat similarly situated taxpayers the same but fails to do\nso only because the estimated component inadvertently affects some\ntaxpayers differently. A situation of this kind occurred in Texasgulf,\nInc. v. Commissioner, 172 F. 3d 209 (CA2 1999). In that case, a Cana-\ndian mining tax did not permit taxpayers to deduct their specific\nexpenses, but did permit them to deduct a fixed “processing allowance.”\nId., at 211–213. The taxpayer argued that the tax was creditable\nbecause the processing allowance was an attempt to reach net income,\ngross income minus expenses, by using “ ‘a method that is likely to\nproduce an amount that approximates, or is greater than, recovery of\nsuch significant costs and expenditures.’ ” Id., at 215 (quoting 26 CFR\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

Tax J. 237, 243 (1951), it appears to follow that\nthe windfall tax can properly be characterized as an excess\nprofits tax.\n   But not all of the 32 affected companies had an initial\n——————\n§1.901–2(b)(4)(i)(B) (1999)). To support its argument, the taxpayer\nintroduced empirical evidence that roughly 85% of companies facing\nmining tax liability had nonrecoverable expenses less than the pro-\ncessing allowance. Texasgulf, Inc., 172 F. 3d, at 215–216. The Court of\nAppeals agreed with the taxpayer that the tax was a creditable income\ntax because it was clear that the mining tax was attempting to reach\nnet income, albeit by using an estimate to calculate deductions. Id.,\nat 216–217. This result is sensible: A company that happens to have\ndeductible expenses greater than the fixed amount set by the pro-\ncessing allowance is not an instructive outlier regarding the mining\ntaxes predominant character. The mining tax is attempting to reach\nthat company’s net income, but fails to do only because it relies on an\napproximate value for deductions.\n4                  PPL CORP. v.

When these\ndifferent initial period values are inserted into the formu-\nlation proposed by PPL, two results follow. First, these\ncompanies have tax rates different from the 51.71% rate\nthe Court calculates for the 27 other companies. Second,\ntheir excess profits threshold also varies.\n  For example, consider Railtrack Group, a clear outlier\nwith an initial period of 316 days. Inserting this value\ninto the stipulated formula yields the following:\n                                         ܲ\n              ܶܽ‫ × %32 = ݔ‬൤൬365\n×           × 9൰ − ‫ ܸܨ‬൨\n                                        316\nApplying the Court’s algebra, this formula can be reduced\nto the following: ܴ݈ܽ݅‫− ܲ[ × %01.932 = ݔܽܶ ݏ’݌ݑ݋ݎܩ ݇ܿܽݎݐ‬\n(9.62% × ‫ \n .]) ܸܨ‬Railtrack Group’s “effective” tax rate and\nits excess profits threshold (239.10% and 9.62% respec-\ntively) are very different from those companies with the\ncommon initial period length of 1,461 days (51.71% and\n44.47%). See ante, at 10. Railtrack Group is not alone in\nthis respect: four other companies also had tax rates and\nexcess profits thresholds that differed from the majority of\naffected companies. See App. 34, 38–40.2\n   Once these outlier companies are included in the cred-\nitability analysis, it becomes clear that the windfall tax “is\nnot an income tax . . . for all persons” subject to it. 26 CFR\n——————\n  2 The figures for the other four companies are as follows: Powergen\n\nplc, which had an initial period of 1,463 days had a tax rate of 51.64%\nand an excess profits threshold of 44.54%, App. 38–39; National Power\nplc, which had an initial period of 1,456 days, had a rate of 51.89% and\na threshold of 44.32%, id., at 39–40; Northern Ireland Electricity plc,\nwhich had an initial period of 1,380 days, had a rate of 54.75% and a\nthreshold of 42.01%, id., at 40; and British Energy plc, which had an\ninitial period of 260 days, had a rate of 290.60% and a threshold of\n7.91%, id., at 34. British Energy, however, did not end up having any\nwindfall tax liability. Id., at 33.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

A typical income tax\napplies a fixed percentage rate to a base income that\nvaries across taxpayers. An excess profits tax does the\nsame, but incorporates a threshold, which may or may not\nvary across taxpayers, to exempt a portion of the base\nfrom taxation. In contrast, here both of the rate and\nthreshold components vary from company to company\naccording to the D variable.3\n   Seen through this lens, the windfall tax is really a tax\non average profits. See Alstott Brief 28–30. Under the\nparties’ stipulated form of the windfall tax, each company\npays a fixed tax rate of 23% on a base that is calculated by\nfirst multiplying a company’s daily average profits during\nits initial period (i.e.,\t(\n ‫ ,\n)ܦ‬or total profits over the initial\n                           ܲ/\nperiod divided by the length of the initial period) by a fixed\nprice-to-earnings ratio; and then subtracting that com-\npany’s flotation value (‫ .) ܸܨ‬See ante, at 2. In practice, this\nmeans that, for example, a company that earns $100\nmillion over 1,461 days would pay approximately the same\namount of taxes as a company that has earned $25 million\nover 365 days. These two companies would have almost\nthe same average profits. See Alstott Brief 28. This is not\nhow an income tax works.\n   The difference between a tax on profits and tax on aver-\nage profits is especially significant for properly character-\nizing a tax such as the windfall tax. Average daily profits\nmultiplied by a price-to-earnings ratio, rather than being a\n——————\n  3 At oral argument, PPL contended that an excess profits tax in which\n\nthe excess profits threshold varies according to market capitalization\nwould also have an effective tax rate that varies across taxpayers but\nremains creditable. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26–27. That might be true, but\nthat does not describe the situation here. In PPL’s hypothetical, any\nshift in the effective tax rate depends on the profits threshold; Here,\nunder PPL’s version of the windfall tax, both the effective tax rate and\nthe profits threshold move proportionately to a company’s initial period\nlength.\n6                  PPL CORP. v. COMMISSIONER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nway of approximating income, is a way of approximating\nvalue.4 See Thompson, A Lawyer’s Guide to Modern Val-\nuation Techniques in Mergers and Acquisitions, 21 J.\nCorp. L. 457, 532–533 (1996) (describing similar valuation\ntechniques using price-to-earnings ratios). Accordingly,\nincorporating an outlier like Railtrack Group into the\npredominant character analysis suggests that the windfall\ntax is a tax on a company’s value. Railtrack Group and\nthe companies like it are not random outliers, Brief for\nPetitioners 38, n. 3, but instead are critical pieces of data\nfor understanding how the tax actually functioned as a\nmatter of “economic realit[y].” Commissioner v. Southwest\nExploration Co., 350 U. S. 308, 315 (1956).\n  This argument, however, rests on the premise that\nbecause the relevant regulations state that “a tax either is\nor is not an income tax, in its entirety, for all persons\nsubject to the tax,” 26 CFR §1.901–2(a)(1)(ii), a tax’s pre-\ndominant character must be as an income tax for all tax-\npayers. But if a tax only needs to be an income tax for\n“a substantial number of taxpayers” and does not have to\n“satisfy the predominant character test in its application\nto all taxpayers,” Exxon Corp. v. Commissioner, 113 T. C.\n338, 352 (1999), then this average profits argument cannot\nget off the ground. Under this reading, the regulations tell\ncourts to treat outliers like Railtrack Group as flukes.\n  At oral argument, the Government apparently rejected\nthe notion that “outliers” like Railtrack Group are relevant\nto creditability analysis. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35–39. The\nGovernment also did not argue these outliers’ relevance\n——————\n   4 Petitioners suggested at oral argument that because some of the\n\noutlier taxpayers may have been subject to a more favorable regulatory\nregime in the wake of their privatization, their outsized tax rates are\nless meaningful because they could recoup their windfall tax burdens.\nSee id., at 16–17. Even accepting the premise of this argument, it still\ndoes not change that fact that in “substance,” ante, at 9, the tax func-\ntioned as value tax for these companies.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Thus, while I find this argument persuasive, I do\nnot base my analysis of this case on it and therefore con-\ncur in the Court’s opinion.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/868382/", "sha1": "b74ed7a4b02c143f8e682299fb72cf0141840510", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-045", "time_retrieved": "2013-05-20T17:01:26.421378"}
