LANCASTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013547.      Argued April 24, 2013\u2014Decided May 20, 2013\nOn April 23, 1993, respondent Burt Lancaster, a former police officer\n with a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot and killed\n his girlfriend. At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancas-\n ter asserted a defense of diminished capacity. Under then-prevailing\n Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, the diminished-capacity de-\n fense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of men-\n tal illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particu-\n lar crime. Apparently unpersuaded by Lancaster\u2019s defense, the jury\n convicted him of first-degree murder and a related firearm offense.\n Lancaster, however, later obtained federal habeas relief from these\n convictions.\n    By the time of Lancaster\u2019s retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court\n had rejected the diminished-capacity defense in its 2001 decision in\n Carpenter. Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged\n occurred several years before Carpenter was decided, the judge at his\n second trial applied Carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of\n his diminished-capacity defense. Lancaster was again convicted. Af-\n firming, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Lancaster\u2019s argu-\n ment that the trial court\u2019s retroactive application of Carpenter vio-\n lated due process.\n    Lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas pe-\n tition. The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit\n reversed. Concluding that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s 2001 rejec-\n tion of the diminished-capacity defense was unforeseeable in April\n 1993, when Lancaster killed his girlfriend, the Sixth Circuit held\n that, by rejecting Lancaster\u2019s due process claim, the Michigan Court\n of Appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.\nHeld: Lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief. Pp. 4\u201315.\n2                       METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n    1996 (AEDPA), Lancaster may obtain federal habeas relief only if the\n    Michigan Court of Appeals, in rejecting his due process claim, unrea-\n    sonably applied \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by\n    [this] Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). This standard is \u201cdifficult to\n    meet\u201d: Lancaster must show that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 de-\n    cision rested on \u201can error well understood and comprehended in ex-\n    isting law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Har-\n    rington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___. To determine whether\n    Lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard, the Court first\n    considers two key decisions: Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347,\n    and Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451. It then considers whether\n    the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision qualifies as an unreasonable\n    application of those decisions to Lancaster\u2019s case. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) Bouie concerned African-American petitioners who had refused\n    to leave a South Carolina drug store\u2019s whites-only restaurant area af-\n    ter entering without notice that the store\u2019s policy barred their entry.\n    They were convicted under a South Carolina trespass statute pro-\n    hibiting \u201c \u2018entry upon the lands of another . . . after notice from the\n    owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\u2019 \u201d 378 U. S., at 349\u2013350. The\n    South Carolina Supreme Court based its affirmance of the petition-\n    ers\u2019 convictions on its prior decision in Mitchell, where the court held\n    that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and \u201cthe\n    act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to\n    leave.\u201d 378 U. S., at 350. Mitchell, however, was rendered 21 months\n    after the petitioners\u2019 arrest. This Court held that the Due Process\n    Clause prohibited Mitchell\u2019s retroactive application to the Bouie peti-\n    tioners, stressing that Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of the state trespass\n    statute was \u201cclearly at variance with the statutory language\u201d and\n    \u201cha[d] not the slightest support in prior South Carolina decisions.\u201d\n    378 U. S., at 356.\n       In Rogers, the petitioner contested the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s\n    retroactive abolition of the common-law \u201cyear and a day rule,\u201d which\n    barred a murder conviction \u201cunless [the] victim had died by the de-\n    fendant\u2019s act within a year and a day of the act.\u201d 532 U. S., at 453.\n    This Court found no due process violation. \u201c[J]udicial alteration of a\n    common law doctrine of criminal law,\u201d the Court held, \u201cviolates the\n    principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive ef-\n    fect, only where [the alteration] is \u2018unexpected and indefensible by\n    reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in\n    issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 462. Judged by this standard, the retroactive aboli-\n    tion of the year and a day rule encountered no constitutional imped-\n    iment. The rule was \u201cwidely viewed as an outdated relic of the com-\n    mon law,\u201d had been routinely rejected by modern courts and\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

Pp. 6\u20138.\n     (c) The Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of Lancaster\u2019s due pro-\n  cess claim does not represent an unreasonable application of the law\n  this Court declared in Bouie and Rogers. Pp. 8\u201315.\n        (1) The Michigan Court of Appeals first recognized the dimin-\n  ished-capacity defense in 1973. Two years later, the Michigan Legis-\n  lature prescribed comprehensive requirements for defenses based on\n  mental illness or retardation. In 1978, the Michigan Court of Ap-\n  peals ruled that the diminished-capacity defense fit within the codi-\n  fied definition of insanity. The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s 2001 deci-\n  sion in Carpenter, however, rejected that position, holding that the\n  diminished-capacity defense was not encompassed within the Michi-\n  gan Legislature\u2019s comprehensive scheme for mental-illness defenses\n  and thus could not be invoked by criminal defendants. Pp. 8\u201312.\n        (2) In light of this Court\u2019s precedent and the history of Michigan\u2019s\n  diminished-capacity defense, the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\n  applying Carpenter retroactively is not \u201can unreasonable application\n  of . . . clearly established [f]ederal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). This\n  case is a far cry from Bouie, where the South Carolina Supreme\n  Court unexpectedly expanded \u201cnarrow and precise statutory lan-\n  guage\u201d that, as written, did not reach the petitioners\u2019 conduct. 378\n  U. S., at 352. In Carpenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court\n  rejected a diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably\n  found to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point statute enacted\n  by the Michigan Legislature. Although Lancaster\u2019s due process claim\n  is arguably less weak than the due process claim rejected in Rogers,\n  the Court did not hold in Rogers that a newly announced judicial rule\n  may be applied retroactively only if the rule it replaces was an \u201cout-\n  dated relic\u201d rarely appearing in a jurisdiction\u2019s case law. 532 U. S.,\n  at 462\u2013467. Distinguishing Rogers thus does little to bolster Lancas-\n  ter\u2019s argument that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision unrea-\n  sonably applied clearly established federal law. This Court has never\n  found a due process violation in circumstances remotely resembling\n  Lancaster\u2019s case\u2014i.e., where a state supreme court, squarely ad-\n  dressing a particular issue for the first time, rejected a consistent line\n  of lower court decisions based on the supreme court\u2019s reasonable in-\n  terpretation of the language of a controlling statute. Fairminded ju-\n  rists could conclude that a state supreme court decision of that order\n  is not \u201c \u2018unexpected and indefensible by reference to [existing] law.\u2019 \u201d\n  Id., at 462.

At\nthe time the crime was committed, Michigan\u2019s intermediate\nappellate court had repeatedly recognized \u201cdiminished\ncapacity\u201d as a defense negating the mens rea element of\nfirst-degree murder. By the time of Lancaster\u2019s trial and\nconviction, however, the Michigan Supreme Court in\nPeople v. Carpenter, 464 Mich. 223, 627 N. W. 2d 276\n(2001), had rejected the defense. Lancaster asserts that\nretroactive application of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Carpenter denied him due process of law. On\nhabeas review, a federal court must assess a claim for\nrelief under the demanding standard set by the Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).\nUnder that standard, Lancaster may gain relief only if\nthe state-court decision he assails \u201cwas contrary to, or in-\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by [this] Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). We hold that Lancaster\u2019s petition does not\nmeet AEDPA\u2019s requirement and that the United States\n2                    METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in granting\nhim federal habeas relief.\n                              I\n  On April 23, 1993, Lancaster, a former police officer\nwith a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot\nand killed his girlfriend in a shopping-plaza parking lot.\nAt his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster\nadmitted that he had killed his girlfriend but asserted\ninsanity and diminished-capacity defenses. Under then-\nprevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, a defend-\nant who pleaded diminished capacity, although he was\nlegally sane, could \u201coffer evidence of some mental abnor-\nmality to negate the specific intent required to commit\na particular crime.\u201d Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232, 627\nN. W. 2d, at 280. If a defendant succeeded in showing that\nmental illness prevented him from \u201cform[ing] the specific\nstate of mind required as an essential element of a crime,\u201d\nhe could \u201cbe convicted only of a lower grade of the offense\nnot requiring that particular mental element.\u201d Ibid. (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n  Apparently unpersuaded by Lancaster\u2019s defenses, the\njury convicted him of first-degree murder, in violation of\nMich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7750.316 (West 1991),1 and pos-\nsessing a firearm in the commission of a felony, in vio-\nlation of \u00a7750.227b (West Cum. Supp. 2004). Lancaster\nlater obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions,\nhowever, because, in conflict with Batson v. Kentucky, 476\nU. S. 79 (1986), the prosecutor had exercised a race-based\nperemptory challenge to remove a potential juror. See\nLancaster v. Adams, 324 F. 3d 423 (CA6 2003).\n  Lancaster was retried in 2005. By that time, the Michigan\nSupreme Court had disapproved the \u201cseries of [Michigan\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 As relevant here, a homicide constitutes first-degree murder under\n\nMich.

W. 2d, at 282. In rejecting the defense, Michigan\u2019s high\ncourt observed that, in 1975, the Michigan Legislature had\nenacted \u201ca comprehensive statutory scheme concerning de-\nfenses based on either mental illness or mental retarda-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 236, 627 N. W. 2d, at 282. That scheme, the\nMichigan Supreme Court concluded, \u201cdemonstrate[d] the\nLegislature\u2019s intent to preclude the use of any evidence of\na defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity short of legal insan-\nity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility.\u201d Ibid.\n   Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged\noccurred several years before the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Carpenter, the judge presiding at Lan-\ncaster\u2019s second trial applied Carpenter\u2019s holding and there-\nfore disallowed renewal of Lancaster\u2019s diminished-capacity\ndefense. Following a bench trial, Lancaster was again\nconvicted. The trial court imposed a sentence of life im-\nprisonment for the first-degree murder conviction and a\nconsecutive two-year sentence for the related firearm\noffense.\n   Lancaster appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a\u201378a. The\nappeals court rejected Lancaster\u2019s argument that retro-\nactive application of Carpenter to his case violated his right\nto due process. \u201c[D]ue process concerns prevent retroac-\ntive application [of judicial decisions] in some cases,\u201d the\ncourt acknowledged, \u201cespecially . . . where the decision is\nunforeseeable and has the effect of changing existing law.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. But Carpenter \u201cdid not involve\na change in the law,\u201d the Court of Appeals reasoned, \u201cbe-\ncause it concerned an unambiguous statute that was\ninterpreted by the [Michigan] Supreme Court for the first\ntime.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a.\n   After the Michigan Supreme Court declined review,\nLancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal\n4                     METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhabeas petition filed under 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254. The District\nCourt denied the petition, 735 F. Supp. 2d 750 (ED Mich.\n2010), but it granted a certificate of appealability, see 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72253(c).\n   A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed. 683 F. 3d\n740 (2012). The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nCarpenter was unforeseeable, the Court of Appeals major-\nity concluded, given (1) the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019\nconsistent recognition of the diminished-capacity defense;\n(2) the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s repeated references to\nthe defense without casting a shadow of doubt on it; and\n(3) the inclusion of the diminished-capacity defense in the\nMichigan State Bar\u2019s pattern jury instructions. 683 F. 3d,\nat 745\u2013749. These considerations persuaded the Sixth\nCircuit majority that, in rejecting Lancaster\u2019s due process\nclaim, the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably\napplied clearly established federal law. Id., at 752\u2013753.\nAccordingly, the Sixth Circuit ruled that Lancaster was en-\ntitled to a new trial at which he could present his diminished-\ncapacity defense. Id., at 754. Dissenting, Chief Judge\nBatchelder concluded that the \u201cMichigan Court of Ap-\npeals[\u2019] denial of Lancaster\u2019s due process claim was rea-\nsonable . . . because the diminished-capacity defense was\nnot well-established in Michigan and its elimination was,\ntherefore, foreseeable.\u201d Id., at 755.\n   This Court granted certiorari. 568 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  To obtain federal habeas relief under AEDPA\u2019s stric-\ntures, Lancaster must establish that, in rejecting his due\nprocess claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals unreason-\nably applied federal law clearly established in our decisions.\nSee 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).2 This standard, we have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Title 28 U. S.

S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nexplained, is \u201cdifficult to meet\u201d: To obtain habeas corpus\nrelief from a federal court, a state prisoner must show that\nthe challenged state-court ruling rested on \u201can error well\nunderstood and comprehended in existing law beyond any\npossibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v.\nRichter, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12\u201313). To\ndetermine whether Lancaster has satisfied that demand-\ning standard, we consider first two of this Court\u2019s key\ndecisions: Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964),\nand Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451 (2001). We then\nconsider whether the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\nqualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions\nto the particular circumstances of Lancaster\u2019s case.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate court\u2019s adjudication of the claim (1) \u201cresulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States,\u201d or (2) \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre-\nsented in the State court proceeding.\u201d Lancaster does not allege that\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts\u201d in his case, nor does he develop any ar-\ngument that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d this Court\u2019s\nprecedents. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 412\u2013413 (2000) (a\nstate-court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if\n\u201cthe state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this\nCourt on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently\nthan this Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts\u201d). The\nonly question in this case, therefore, is whether the Michigan Court of\nAppeals unreasonably applied \u201cclearly established [f]ederal law, as\ndetermined by [this] Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   3 Lancaster does not argue that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s rejec-\n\ntion of the diminished-capacity defense in People v. Carpenter, 464\nMich. 223, 627 N. W. 2d 276 (2001), if applied only prospectively to\ndefendants whose alleged offenses were committed after the decision\nwas issued, would violate any constitutional provision. See Clark v.\nArizona, 548 U. S. 735, 756\u2013779 (2006) (rejecting due process challenge\nto Arizona\u2019s restrictions on mental-disease and capacity evidence\noffered to negate mens rea). We therefore address only whether the\nMichigan Court of Appeals unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law in upholding Carpenter\u2019s retroactive application to Lancas-\n6                 METRISH v.

S., at 348\u2013349. This Court held that the\nconvictions violated the due process requirement that \u201ca\ncriminal statute give fair warning of the conduct which it\nprohibits.\u201d Id., at 350. The state statute under which the\npetitioners were convicted, the Court emphasized, prohib-\nited \u201centry upon the lands of another . . . after notice from\nthe owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\u201d Id., at 349\u2013\n350 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). It was undisputed that the petitioners were invited\nto enter the store and had received no notice that they\nwere barred from the restaurant area before they occupied\nbooth seats. Id., at 350. Nevertheless, the South Carolina\nSupreme Court affirmed the petitioners\u2019 convictions based\non its prior decision in Charleston v. Mitchell, 239 S. C.\n376, 123 S. E. 2d 512 (1961). Bouie, 378 U. S., at 350, n. 2.\nThe Mitchell decision, which the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt found dispositive, was rendered 21 months after the\npetitioners\u2019 arrest. 378 U. S., at 348, 350, n. 2. Mitchell\nheld that the trespass statute under which the petitioners\nwere convicted reached not only unauthorized entries; it\nproscribed as well \u201cthe act of remaining on the premises of\nanother after receiving notice to leave.\u201d 378 U. S., at 350.\n   We held that the Due Process Clause prohibited Mitch-\nell\u2019s retroactive application to the Bouie petitioners. In so\nruling, we stressed that Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of the\nSouth Carolina trespass statute was \u201cclearly at variance\nwith the statutory language\u201d and \u201cha[d] not the slightest\nsupport in prior South Carolina decisions.\u201d 378 U. S., at\n356. Due process, we said, does not countenance an \u201cun-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nter\u2019s case. \n\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

S., at 453. That rule barred\na murder conviction \u201cunless [the] victim had died by the\ndefendant\u2019s act within a year and a day of the act.\u201d Ibid.\nThe victim in Rogers had died some 15 months after the\npetitioner stabbed him. Id., at 454. We held that the\nTennessee Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to adhere to the year\nand a day rule in the petitioner\u2019s case did not violate due\nprocess. Id., at 466\u2013467. The \u201cdue process limitations on\nthe retroactive application of judicial decisions,\u201d we ex-\nplained, are not coextensive with the limitations placed on\nlegislatures by the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clauses.\nId., at 459. See also U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3; id., \u00a710,\ncl. 1; Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (seriatim\nopinion of Chase, J.) (describing four categories of laws\nprohibited by the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clauses).\nStrictly applying ex post facto principles to judicial deci-\nsionmaking, we recognized, \u201cwould place an unworkable\nand unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes\nand would be incompatible with the resolution of uncer-\ntainty that marks any evolving legal system.\u201d Rogers,\n532 U. S., at 461. \u201c[J]udicial alteration of a common law\ndoctrine of criminal law,\u201d we therefore held, \u201cviolates the\nprinciple of fair warning, and hence must not be given\nretroactive effect, only where [the alteration] is \u2018unex-\npected and indefensible by reference to the law which had\nbeen expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 462\n(quoting Bouie, 378 U. S., at 354).\n   Judged by this standard, we explained, the retroactive\nabolition of the year and a day rule encountered no consti-\ntutional impediment. First, the rule was \u201cwidely viewed\nas an outdated relic of the common law\u201d and had been\n\u201clegislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of\n8                     METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue.\u201d Rog-\ners, 532 U. S., at 462\u2013463. Second, the rule \u201chad only the\nmost tenuous foothold\u201d in Tennessee, having been men-\ntioned in reported Tennessee decisions \u201conly three times,\nand each time in dicta.\u201d Id., at 464. Abolishing the obso-\nlete rule in Rogers\u2019 case, we were satisfied, was not \u201cthe\nsort of unfair and arbitrary judicial action against which\nthe Due Process Clause aims to protect.\u201d Id., at 466\u2013467.\n                             B\n                             1\n   Does the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of Lan-\ncaster\u2019s due process claim represent an unreasonable ap-\nplication of the law we declared in Bouie and Rogers?\nAddressing that question, we first summarize the history\nof the diminished-capacity defense in Michigan.\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals first recognized the\ndefense in People v. Lynch, 47 Mich. App. 8, 208 N. W. 2d\n656 (1973).     See Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 233, 627\nN. W. 2d, at 281. The defendant in Lynch was convicted of\nfirst-degree murder for starving her newborn daughter.\n47 Mich. App., at 9, 208 N. W. 2d, at 656. On appeal, the\ndefendant challenged the trial court\u2019s exclusion of psychi-\natric testimony \u201cbearing on [her] state of mind.\u201d Id., at 14,\n208 N. W. 2d, at 659. She sought to introduce this evi-\ndence not to show she was legally insane at the time of her\nchild\u2019s death.4 Instead, her plea was that she lacked the\nmens rea necessary to commit first-degree murder. Ibid.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    4 At\n      the time of Lynch, Michigan courts used a two-part test for insan-\nity derived from the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v.\nDurfee, 62 Mich. 487, 494, 29 N. W. 109, 112 (1886). The Durfee test\nasked \u201c1) whether defendant knew what he was doing was right or\nwrong; and 2) if he did, did he have the power, the will power, to resist\ndoing the wrongful act?\u201d People v. Martin, 386 Mich. 407, 418, 192\nN. W. 2d 215, 220 (1971). See also Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 234, n. 7,\n627 N. W. 2d, at 281, n. 7.\n                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)               9\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nReversing the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanding for a\nnew trial, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the view\n\u201cthat mental capacity is an all or nothing matter and that\nonly insanity . . . negates criminal intent.\u201d Id., at 20, 208\nN. W. 2d, at 662. Aligning itself with the \u201cmajority . . .\nview,\u201d the court permitted defendants to present relevant\npsychiatric \u201ctestimony bearing on intent.\u201d Id., at 20\u201321,\n208 N.

W.\n2d, at 662 (noting that \u201csuch medical proof \u201d is \u201csometimes\ncalled proof of diminished or partial responsibility\u201d).\n  In 1975, two years after the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019\ndecision in Lynch, the Michigan Legislature enacted \u201ca com-\nprehensive statutory scheme setting forth the require-\nments for and the effects of asserting a defense based\non either mental illness or mental retardation.\u201d Carpen-\nter, 464 Mich., at 226, 627 N. W. 2d, at 277. See also 1975\nMich. Pub. Acts pp. 384\u2013388. That legislation, which\nremained in effect at the time of the April 1993 shooting at\nissue here, provided that \u201c[a] person is legally insane if, as\na result of mental illness . . . or . . . mental retardation . . .\nthat person lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate\nthe wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his con-\nduct to the requirements of law.\u201d Id., at 386 (codified\nas amended, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7768.21a(1) (West\n2000)). The legislature required defendants in felony\ncases to notify the prosecution and the court at least 30\ndays before trial of their intent to assert an insanity de-\nfense. 1975 Mich. Pub. Acts p. 385 (codified as amended,\n\u00a7768.20a(1)). Defendants raising an insanity defense, the\nlegislature further provided, must submit to a court-\nordered psychiatric examination. Id., at 385 (codified as\namended, \u00a7768.20a(2)).\n  The 1975 Act also introduced the verdict of \u201cguilty but\nmentally ill\u201d for defendants who suffer from mental illness\nbut do not satisfy the legal definition of insanity. Id., at\n387 (codified as amended, \u00a7768.36(1) (West Cum. Supp.\n10                METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n2013)). The legislature provided for the psychiatric evalu-\nation and treatment of defendants found \u201cguilty but men-\ntally ill\u201d but did not exempt them from the sentencing\nprovisions applicable to defendants without mental illness.\nId., at 387\u2013388 (codified as amended, \u00a7\u00a7768.36(3)\u2013(4)).\n  Although the 1975 Act did not specifically address the\ndefense of diminished capacity, the Michigan Court of\nAppeals ruled in 1978 that the defense \u201ccomes within th[e]\ncodified definition of legal insanity.\u201d People v. Mangia-\npane, 85 Mich. App. 379, 395, 271 N. W. 2d 240, 249.\nTherefore, the court held, a defendant claiming that he\nlacked the \u201cmental capacity to entertain the specific intent\nrequired as an element of the crime with which he [was]\ncharged\u201d had to comply with the statutory procedural\nrequirements applicable to insanity defenses, including\nthe requirements of pretrial notice and submission to\ncourt-ordered examination. Ibid.\n  Because the 1975 Act did not indicate which party bears\nthe burden of proof on the issue of insanity, Michigan\ncourts continued to apply the common-law burden-shifting\nframework in effect at the time of the insanity defense\u2019s\ncodification. See People v. McRunels, 237 Mich. App. 168,\n172, 603 N. W. 2d 95, 98 (1999). Under that framework,\na criminal defendant bore the initial burden of present-\ning some evidence of insanity, at which point the burden\nshifted to the prosecution to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See In re Certified Question,\n425 Mich. 457, 465\u2013466, 390 N. W. 2d 620, 623\u2013624\n(1986); People v. Savoie, 419 Mich. 118, 126, 349 N. W. 2d\n139, 143 (1984). The Michigan Court of Appeals applied\nthe same burden-shifting framework to the diminished-\ncapacity defense. See People v. Denton, 138 Mich. App.\n568, 571\u2013572, 360 N. W. 2d 245, 247\u2013248 (1984).\n  In 1994, however, the Michigan Legislature amended\nMich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7768.21a, the statute codifying\nthe insanity defense, to provide that the defendant bears\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                 11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe burden of proving the defense of insanity by a pre-\nponderance of the evidence.\u201d 1994 Mich. Pub. Acts p. 252\n(codified at \u00a7768.21a(3)). In Carpenter, the defendant\nargued that the trial court had erred by applying the 1994\nAct to require him to establish his diminished-capacity\ndefense by a preponderance of the evidence. 464 Mich., at\n225\u2013226, 235, 627 N. W. 2d, at 277, 282. Rejecting this\ncontention, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the\ndefendant\u2019s convictions. See People v. Carpenter, No.\n204051, 1999 WL 33438799 (July 16, 1999) (per curiam).\nConsistent with its decision in Mangiapane, the court held\nthat the 1994 statutory amendments applied to defend-\nants raising the diminished-capacity defense, and it fur-\nther held that requiring defendants to establish their\ndiminished capacity by a preponderance of the evidence\ndid not unconstitutionally relieve the prosecution of its\nburden to prove the mens rea elements of a crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Id., at *1\u2013*2.\n   In turn, the Michigan Supreme Court also affirmed, but\nit did so on an entirely different ground. As earlier stated,\nsee supra, at 2\u20133, the court concluded that in no case could\ncriminal defendants invoke the diminished-capacity de-\nfense, for that defense was not encompassed within the\n\u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d the Michigan Legisla-\nture had enacted to govern defenses based on mental\nillness or retardation. Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 236, 627\nN. W. 2d, at 282. Noting that previously it had \u201cacknowl-\nedged in passing the concept of the diminished capacity\ndefense,\u201d5 Michigan\u2019s high court emphasized that it had\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Carpenter cited three decisions in which the Michigan Supreme\n\nCourt had previously mentioned the diminished-capacity defense: (1)\nPeople v. Lloyd, 459 Mich. 433, 450, 590 N. W. 2d 738, 745 (1999) (per\ncuriam), which held that defense counsel was not constitutionally\nineffective in presenting a diminished-capacity defense rather than an\ninsanity defense; (2) People v. Pickens, 446 Mich. 298, 329\u2013331, 521\nN. W. 2d 797, 811\u2013812 (1994), which rejected a defendant\u2019s claim that\n12                    METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cnever specifically authorized . . . use [of the defense] in\nMichigan courts.\u201d Id., at 232\u2013233, 627 N. W. 2d, at 281.\nSquarely addressing the issue for the first time, the court\nconcluded that the diminished-capacity defense was in-\ncompatible with the Michigan Legislature\u2019s \u201cconclusiv[e]\ndetermin[ation]\u201d of the circumstances under which \u201cmen-\ntal incapacity can serve as a basis for relieving [a defend-\nant] from criminal responsibility.\u201d       Id., at 237, 627\nN. W. 2d, at 283. The statutory scheme enacted by the\nMichigan Legislature, the court held, \u201ccreated an all or\nnothing insanity defense.\u201d Ibid. But cf. supra, at 9. A\ndefendant who is \u201cmentally ill or retarded yet not legally\ninsane,\u201d the court explained, \u201cmay be found \u2018guilty but\nmentally ill,\u2019 \u201d but the legislature had foreclosed the use\nof \u201cevidence of mental incapacity short of insanity . . . to\navoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific\nintent.\u201d 464 Mich., at 237, 627 N. W. 2d, at 283.\n                            2\n  The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that applying\nCarpenter retroactively to Lancaster\u2019s case did not violate\ndue process, for Carpenter \u201cconcerned an unambiguous\nstatute that was interpreted by the [Michigan] Supreme\nCourt for the first time.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a. As\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhis attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to pursue a\ndiminished-capacity defense; and (3) People v. Griffin, 433 Mich. 860,\n444 N. W. 2d 139, 140 (1989) (per curiam), a summary order remanding\na case to the trial court for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s claim that the\ndefendant\u2019s attorney was ineffective \u201cfor failing to explore defenses of\ndiminished capacity and insanity.\u201d See Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232\u2013\n233, 627 N.

But in light of our precedent and the his-\ntory recounted above, see Part II\u2013B\u20131, supra, the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision applying Carpenter retroac-\ntively does not warrant disapprobation as \u201can unreasonable\napplication of . . . clearly established [f]ederal law.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   This case is a far cry from Bouie, where, unlike Rogers,\nthe Court held that the retroactive application of a judicial\ndecision violated due process. In Bouie, the South Caro-\nlina Supreme Court had unexpectedly expanded \u201cnarrow\nand precise statutory language\u201d that, as written, did not\nreach the petitioners\u2019 conduct. 378 U. S., at 352. In Car-\npenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected\na diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably\nfound to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point stat-\nute enacted by the Michigan Legislature. Carpenter thus\npresents the inverse of the situation this Court confronted\nin Bouie. Rather than broadening a statute that was\nnarrow on its face, Carpenter disapproved lower court\nprecedent recognizing a defense Michigan\u2019s high court\nfound, on close inspection, to lack statutory grounding.\nThe situation we confronted in Bouie bears scant resem-\nblance to this case, and our resolution of that controversy\nhardly makes disallowance of Lancaster\u2019s diminished-\ncapacity defense an unreasonable reading of this Court\u2019s\nlaw.\n   On the other hand, as the Sixth Circuit recognized, see\n683 F. 3d, at 749\u2013751, Lancaster\u2019s argument against\napplying Carpenter retroactively is arguably less weak\nthan the argument opposing retroactivity we rejected in\nRogers. Unlike the year and a day rule at issue in Rogers,\nthe diminished-capacity defense is not an \u201coutdated relic\nof the common law\u201d widely rejected by modern courts and\n14                METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlegislators. 532 U. S., at 462. To the contrary, the Model\nPenal Code sets out a version of the defense. See ALI,\nModel Penal Code \u00a74.02(1), pp. 216\u2013217 (1985) (\u201cEvidence\nthat the defendant suffered from a mental disease or\ndefect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that\nthe defendant did or did not have a state of mind that is\nan element of the offense.\u201d). See also id., Comment 2, at\n219 (\u201cThe Institute perceived no justification for a limita-\ntion on evidence that may bear significantly on a determi-\nnation of the mental state of the defendant at the time of\nthe commission of the crime.\u201d). And not long before the\n1993 shooting at issue here, the American Bar Association\nhad approved criminal-justice guidelines that (1) favored\nthe admissibility of mental-health evidence offered to ne-\ngate mens rea, and (2) reported that a majority of States\nallowed presentation of such evidence in at least some\ncircumstances. See ABA Criminal Justice Mental Health\nStandards \u00a77\u20136.2, and Commentary, pp. 347\u2013349, and n. 2\n(1989). See also Clark v. Arizona, 548 U. S. 735, 800\n(2006) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (reporting that in 2006,\n\u201ca substantial majority of the States\u201d permitted the intro-\nduction of \u201cmental-illness evidence to negate mens rea\u201d).\n   Furthermore, the year and a day rule was mentioned\nonly three times in dicta in Tennessee reported decisions.\nRogers, 532 U. S., at 464. The diminished-capacity de-\nfense, by contrast, had been adhered to repeatedly by the\nMichigan Court of Appeals. See supra, at 8\u201310. It had\nalso been \u201c \u2018acknowledged in passing\u2019 \u201d in Michigan Su-\npreme Court decisions and was reflected in the Michigan\nState Bar\u2019s pattern jury instructions. 683 F. 3d, at 746\u2013\n749 (quoting Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232, 627 N. W. 2d,\nat 281).\n   These considerations, however, are hardly sufficient to\nwarrant federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s demanding standard. See Williams v. Tay-\nlor, 529 U. S. 362, 410 (2000) (\u201c[A]n unreasonable applica-\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Rogers did not hold that a newly\nannounced judicial rule may be applied retroactively only\nif the rule it replaces was an \u201coutdated relic\u201d rarely ap-\npearing in a jurisdiction\u2019s case law. 532 U. S., at 462\u2013467.\nDistinguishing Rogers, a case in which we rejected a due\nprocess claim, thus does little to bolster Lancaster\u2019s argu-\nment that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established federal law. See Wil-\nliams, 529 U.

LANCASTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013547.      Argued April 24, 2013\u2014Decided May 20, 2013\nOn April 23, 1993, respondent Burt Lancaster, a former police officer\n with a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot and killed\n his girlfriend. At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancas-\n ter asserted a defense of diminished capacity. Under then-prevailing\n Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, the diminished-capacity de-\n fense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of men-\n tal illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particu-\n lar crime. Apparently unpersuaded by Lancaster\u2019s defense, the jury\n convicted him of first-degree murder and a related firearm offense.\n Lancaster, however, later obtained federal habeas relief from these\n convictions.\n    By the time of Lancaster\u2019s retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court\n had rejected the diminished-capacity defense in its 2001 decision in\n Carpenter. Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged\n occurred several years before Carpenter was decided, the judge at his\n second trial applied Carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of\n his diminished-capacity defense. Lancaster was again convicted. Af-\n firming, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Lancaster\u2019s argu-\n ment that the trial court\u2019s retroactive application of Carpenter vio-\n lated due process.\n    Lancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas pe-\n tition. The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit\n reversed. Concluding that the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s 2001 rejec-\n tion of the diminished-capacity defense was unforeseeable in April\n 1993, when Lancaster killed his girlfriend, the Sixth Circuit held\n that, by rejecting Lancaster\u2019s due process claim, the Michigan Court\n of Appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.\nHeld: Lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief. Pp. 4\u201315.\n2                       METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n    1996 (AEDPA), Lancaster may obtain federal habeas relief only if the\n    Michigan Court of Appeals, in rejecting his due process claim, unrea-\n    sonably applied \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by\n    [this] Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). This standard is \u201cdifficult to\n    meet\u201d: Lancaster must show that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 de-\n    cision rested on \u201can error well understood and comprehended in ex-\n    isting law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Har-\n    rington v. Richter, 562 U. S. ___, ___. To determine whether\n    Lancaster has satisfied that demanding standard, the Court first\n    considers two key decisions: Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347,\n    and Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451. It then considers whether\n    the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision qualifies as an unreasonable\n    application of those decisions to Lancaster\u2019s case. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) Bouie concerned African-American petitioners who had refused\n    to leave a South Carolina drug store\u2019s whites-only restaurant area af-\n    ter entering without notice that the store\u2019s policy barred their entry.\n    They were convicted under a South Carolina trespass statute pro-\n    hibiting \u201c \u2018entry upon the lands of another . . . after notice from the\n    owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\u2019 \u201d 378 U. S., at 349\u2013350. The\n    South Carolina Supreme Court based its affirmance of the petition-\n    ers\u2019 convictions on its prior decision in Mitchell, where the court held\n    that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and \u201cthe\n    act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to\n    leave.\u201d 378 U. S., at 350. Mitchell, however, was rendered 21 months\n    after the petitioners\u2019 arrest. This Court held that the Due Process\n    Clause prohibited Mitchell\u2019s retroactive application to the Bouie peti-\n    tioners, stressing that Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of the state trespass\n    statute was \u201cclearly at variance with the statutory language\u201d and\n    \u201cha[d] not the slightest support in prior South Carolina decisions.\u201d\n    378 U. S., at 356.\n       In Rogers, the petitioner contested the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s\n    retroactive abolition of the common-law \u201cyear and a day rule,\u201d which\n    barred a murder conviction \u201cunless [the] victim had died by the de-\n    fendant\u2019s act within a year and a day of the act.\u201d 532 U. S., at 453.\n    This Court found no due process violation. \u201c[J]udicial alteration of a\n    common law doctrine of criminal law,\u201d the Court held, \u201cviolates the\n    principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive ef-\n    fect, only where [the alteration] is \u2018unexpected and indefensible by\n    reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in\n    issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 462. Judged by this standard, the retroactive aboli-\n    tion of the year and a day rule encountered no constitutional imped-\n    iment.

Pp. 6\u20138.\n     (c) The Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of Lancaster\u2019s due pro-\n  cess claim does not represent an unreasonable application of the law\n  this Court declared in Bouie and Rogers. Pp. 8\u201315.\n        (1) The Michigan Court of Appeals first recognized the dimin-\n  ished-capacity defense in 1973. Two years later, the Michigan Legis-\n  lature prescribed comprehensive requirements for defenses based on\n  mental illness or retardation. In 1978, the Michigan Court of Ap-\n  peals ruled that the diminished-capacity defense fit within the codi-\n  fied definition of insanity. The Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s 2001 deci-\n  sion in Carpenter, however, rejected that position, holding that the\n  diminished-capacity defense was not encompassed within the Michi-\n  gan Legislature\u2019s comprehensive scheme for mental-illness defenses\n  and thus could not be invoked by criminal defendants. Pp. 8\u201312.\n        (2) In light of this Court\u2019s precedent and the history of Michigan\u2019s\n  diminished-capacity defense, the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\n  applying Carpenter retroactively is not \u201can unreasonable application\n  of . . . clearly established [f]ederal law.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1). This\n  case is a far cry from Bouie, where the South Carolina Supreme\n  Court unexpectedly expanded \u201cnarrow and precise statutory lan-\n  guage\u201d that, as written, did not reach the petitioners\u2019 conduct. 378\n  U. S., at 352. In Carpenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court\n  rejected a diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably\n  found to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point statute enacted\n  by the Michigan Legislature. Although Lancaster\u2019s due process claim\n  is arguably less weak than the due process claim rejected in Rogers,\n  the Court did not hold in Rogers that a newly announced judicial rule\n  may be applied retroactively only if the rule it replaces was an \u201cout-\n  dated relic\u201d rarely appearing in a jurisdiction\u2019s case law. 532 U. S.,\n  at 462\u2013467. Distinguishing Rogers thus does little to bolster Lancas-\n  ter\u2019s argument that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision unrea-\n  sonably applied clearly established federal law. This Court has never\n  found a due process violation in circumstances remotely resembling\n  Lancaster\u2019s case\u2014i.e., where a state supreme court, squarely ad-\n  dressing a particular issue for the first time, rejected a consistent line\n  of lower court decisions based on the supreme court\u2019s reasonable in-\n  terpretation of the language of a controlling statute. Fairminded ju-\n  rists could conclude that a state supreme court decision of that order\n  is not \u201c \u2018unexpected and indefensible by reference to [existing] law.\u2019 \u201d\n  Id., at 462.

At\nthe time the crime was committed, Michigan\u2019s intermediate\nappellate court had repeatedly recognized \u201cdiminished\ncapacity\u201d as a defense negating the mens rea element of\nfirst-degree murder. By the time of Lancaster\u2019s trial and\nconviction, however, the Michigan Supreme Court in\nPeople v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849242\"><a href=\"/mich/5ms7/people-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 N. W. 2d 276\n(2001), had rejected the defense. Lancaster asserts that\nretroactive application of the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Carpenter denied him due process of law. On\nhabeas review, a federal court must assess a claim for\nrelief under the demanding standard set by the Antiter-\nrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).\nUnder that standard, Lancaster may gain relief only if\nthe state-court decision he assails \u201cwas contrary to, or in-\nvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nFederal law, as determined by [this] Court.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1). We hold that Lancaster\u2019s petition does not\nmeet AEDPA\u2019s requirement and that the United States\n2                    METRISH v. LANCASTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in granting\nhim federal habeas relief.\n                              I\n  On April 23, 1993, Lancaster, a former police officer\nwith a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot\nand killed his girlfriend in a shopping-plaza parking lot.\nAt his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster\nadmitted that he had killed his girlfriend but asserted\ninsanity and diminished-capacity defenses. Under then-\nprevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, a defend-\nant who pleaded diminished capacity, although he was\nlegally sane, could \u201coffer evidence of some mental abnor-\nmality to negate the specific intent required to commit\na particular crime.\u201d Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232, 627\nN. W. 2d, at 280. If a defendant succeeded in showing that\nmental illness prevented him from \u201cform[ing] the specific\nstate of mind required as an essential element of a crime,\u201d\nhe could \u201cbe convicted only of a lower grade of the offense\nnot requiring that particular mental element.\u201d Ibid. (in-\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n  Apparently unpersuaded by Lancaster\u2019s defenses, the\njury convicted him of first-degree murder, in violation of\nMich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7750.316 (West 1991),1 and pos-\nsessing a firearm in the commission of a felony, in vio-\nlation of \u00a7750.227b (West Cum. Supp. 2004). Lancaster\nlater obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions,\nhowever, because, in conflict with Batson v. Kentucky, 476\nU. S. 79 (1986), the prosecutor had exercised a race-based\nperemptory challenge to remove a potential juror. See\nLancaster v. Adams, 324 F. 3d 423 (CA6 2003).\n  Lancaster was retried in 2005.

In rejecting the defense, Michigan\u2019s high\ncourt observed that, in 1975, the Michigan Legislature had\nenacted \u201ca comprehensive statutory scheme concerning de-\nfenses based on either mental illness or mental retarda-\ntion.\u201d Id., at 236, 627 N. W. 2d, at 282. That scheme, the\nMichigan Supreme Court concluded, \u201cdemonstrate[d] the\nLegislature\u2019s intent to preclude the use of any evidence of\na defendant\u2019s lack of mental capacity short of legal insan-\nity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility.\u201d Ibid.\n   Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged\noccurred several years before the Michigan Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision in Carpenter, the judge presiding at Lan-\ncaster\u2019s second trial applied Carpenter\u2019s holding and there-\nfore disallowed renewal of Lancaster\u2019s diminished-capacity\ndefense. Following a bench trial, Lancaster was again\nconvicted. The trial court imposed a sentence of life im-\nprisonment for the first-degree murder conviction and a\nconsecutive two-year sentence for the related firearm\noffense.\n   Lancaster appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 76a\u201378a. The\nappeals court rejected Lancaster\u2019s argument that retro-\nactive application of Carpenter to his case violated his right\nto due process. \u201c[D]ue process concerns prevent retroac-\ntive application [of judicial decisions] in some cases,\u201d the\ncourt acknowledged, \u201cespecially . . . where the decision is\nunforeseeable and has the effect of changing existing law.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 77a.

City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964),\nand Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U. S. 451 (2001). We then\nconsider whether the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\nqualifies as an unreasonable application of those decisions\nto the particular circumstances of Lancaster\u2019s case.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nstate court\u2019s adjudication of the claim (1) \u201cresulted in a decision that\nwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States,\u201d or (2) \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre-\nsented in the State court proceeding.\u201d Lancaster does not allege that\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts\u201d in his case, nor does he develop any ar-\ngument that the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to\u201d this Court\u2019s\nprecedents. See Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.

LANCASTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               A\n\n   In Bouie, the African-American petitioners were con-\nvicted of trespass under South Carolina law after they\nrefused to comply with orders to leave a drug store\u2019s res-\ntaurant department, a facility reserved for white custom-\ners. 378 U. S., at 348\u2013349. This Court held that the\nconvictions violated the due process requirement that \u201ca\ncriminal statute give fair warning of the conduct which it\nprohibits.\u201d Id., at 350. The state statute under which the\npetitioners were convicted, the Court emphasized, prohib-\nited \u201centry upon the lands of another . . . after notice from\nthe owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\u201d Id., at 349\u2013\n350 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omit-\nted). It was undisputed that the petitioners were invited\nto enter the store and had received no notice that they\nwere barred from the restaurant area before they occupied\nbooth seats. Id., at 350. Nevertheless, the South Carolina\nSupreme Court affirmed the petitioners\u2019 convictions based\non its prior decision in Charleston v. Mitchell, 239 S. C.\n376, 123 S. E. 2d 512 (1961). Bouie, 378 U. S., at 350, n. 2.\nThe Mitchell decision, which the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt found dispositive, was rendered 21 months after the\npetitioners\u2019 arrest. 378 U. S., at 348, 350, n. 2. Mitchell\nheld that the trespass statute under which the petitioners\nwere convicted reached not only unauthorized entries; it\nproscribed as well \u201cthe act of remaining on the premises of\nanother after receiving notice to leave.\u201d 378 U. S., at 350.\n   We held that the Due Process Clause prohibited Mitch-\nell\u2019s retroactive application to the Bouie petitioners. In so\nruling, we stressed that Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of the\nSouth Carolina trespass statute was \u201cclearly at variance\nwith the statutory language\u201d and \u201cha[d] not the slightest\nsupport in prior South Carolina decisions.\u201d 378 U. S., at\n356. Due process, we said, does not countenance an \u201cun-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nter\u2019s case. \n\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

S., at 453. That rule barred\na murder conviction \u201cunless [the] victim had died by the\ndefendant\u2019s act within a year and a day of the act.\u201d Ibid.\nThe victim in Rogers had died some 15 months after the\npetitioner stabbed him. Id., at 454. We held that the\nTennessee Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to adhere to the year\nand a day rule in the petitioner\u2019s case did not violate due\nprocess. Id., at 466\u2013467. The \u201cdue process limitations on\nthe retroactive application of judicial decisions,\u201d we ex-\nplained, are not coextensive with the limitations placed on\nlegislatures by the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clauses.\nId., at 459. See also U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a79, cl. 3; id., \u00a710,\ncl. 1; Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798) (seriatim\nopinion of Chase, J.) (describing four categories of laws\nprohibited by the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clauses).\nStrictly applying ex post facto principles to judicial deci-\nsionmaking, we recognized, \u201cwould place an unworkable\nand unacceptable restraint on normal judicial processes\nand would be incompatible with the resolution of uncer-\ntainty that marks any evolving legal system.\u201d Rogers,\n532 U. S., at 461. \u201c[J]udicial alteration of a common law\ndoctrine of criminal law,\u201d we therefore held, \u201cviolates the\nprinciple of fair warning, and hence must not be given\nretroactive effect, only where [the alteration] is \u2018unex-\npected and indefensible by reference to the law which had\nbeen expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 462\n(quoting Bouie, 378 U. S., at 354).\n   Judged by this standard, we explained, the retroactive\nabolition of the year and a day rule encountered no consti-\ntutional impediment. First, the rule was \u201cwidely viewed\nas an outdated relic of the common law\u201d and had been\n\u201clegislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of\n8                     METRISH v.

Second, the rule \u201chad only the\nmost tenuous foothold\u201d in Tennessee, having been men-\ntioned in reported Tennessee decisions \u201conly three times,\nand each time in dicta.\u201d Id., at 464.

But in light of our precedent and the his-\ntory recounted above, see Part II\u2013B\u20131, supra, the Michigan\nCourt of Appeals\u2019 decision applying Carpenter retroac-\ntively does not warrant disapprobation as \u201can unreasonable\napplication of . . . clearly established [f]ederal law.\u201d 28\nU. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n   This case is a far cry from Bouie, where, unlike Rogers,\nthe Court held that the retroactive application of a judicial\ndecision violated due process. In Bouie, the South Caro-\nlina Supreme Court had unexpectedly expanded \u201cnarrow\nand precise statutory language\u201d that, as written, did not\nreach the petitioners\u2019 conduct. 378 U. S., at 352. In Car-\npenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected\na diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably\nfound to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point stat-\nute enacted by the Michigan Legislature. Carpenter thus\npresents the inverse of the situation this Court confronted\nin Bouie. Rather than broadening a statute that was\nnarrow on its face, Carpenter disapproved lower court\nprecedent recognizing a defense Michigan\u2019s high court\nfound, on close inspection, to lack statutory grounding.\nThe situation we confronted in Bouie bears scant resem-\nblance to this case, and our resolution of that controversy\nhardly makes disallowance of Lancaster\u2019s diminished-\ncapacity defense an unreasonable reading of this Court\u2019s\nlaw.\n   On the other hand, as the Sixth Circuit recognized, see\n683 F. 3d, at 749\u2013751, Lancaster\u2019s argument against\napplying Carpenter retroactively is arguably less weak\nthan the argument opposing retroactivity we rejected in\nRogers. Unlike the year and a day rule at issue in Rogers,\nthe diminished-capacity defense is not an \u201coutdated relic\nof the common law\u201d widely rejected by modern courts and\n14                METRISH v.

And not long before the\n1993 shooting at issue here, the American Bar Association\nhad approved criminal-justice guidelines that (1) favored\nthe admissibility of mental-health evidence offered to ne-\ngate mens rea, and (2) reported that a majority of States\nallowed presentation of such evidence in at least some\ncircumstances.

S. 735, 800\n(2006) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (reporting that in 2006,\n\u201ca substantial majority of the States\u201d permitted the intro-\nduction of \u201cmental-illness evidence to negate mens rea\u201d).\n   Furthermore, the year and a day rule was mentioned\nonly three times in dicta in Tennessee reported decisions.\nRogers, 532 U. S., at 464. The diminished-capacity de-\nfense, by contrast, had been adhered to repeatedly by the\nMichigan Court of Appeals. See supra, at 8\u201310. It had\nalso been \u201c \u2018acknowledged in passing\u2019 \u201d in Michigan Su-\npreme Court decisions and was reflected in the Michigan\nState Bar\u2019s pattern jury instructions. 683 F. 3d, at 746\u2013\n749 (quoting Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232, 627 N. W. 2d,\nat 281).\n   These considerations, however, are hardly sufficient to\nwarrant federal habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72254(d)(1)\u2019s demanding standard. See Williams v. Tay-\nlor, 529 U. S. 362, 410 (2000) (\u201c[A]n unreasonable applica-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion of federal law is different from an incorrect appli-\ncation of federal law.\u201d). Rogers did not hold that a newly\nannounced judicial rule may be applied retroactively only\nif the rule it replaces was an \u201coutdated relic\u201d rarely ap-\npearing in a jurisdiction\u2019s case law. 532 U. S., at 462\u2013467.\nDistinguishing Rogers, a case in which we rejected a due\nprocess claim, thus does little to bolster Lancaster\u2019s argu-\nment that the Michigan Court of Appeals\u2019 decision unrea-\nsonably applied clearly established federal law. See Wil-\nliams, 529 U. S., at 412 (the phrase \u201cclearly established\n[f]ederal law\u201d in \u00a72254(d)(1) \u201crefers to the holdings . . . of\nthis Court\u2019s decisions as of the time of the relevant state-\ncourt decision\u201d (emphasis added)).\n   This Court has never found a due process violation in\ncircumstances remotely resembling Lancaster\u2019s case\u2014i.e.,\nwhere a state supreme court, squarely addressing a par-\nticular issue for the first time, rejected a consistent line of\nlower court decisions based on the supreme court\u2019s rea-\nsonable interpretation of the language of a controlling\nstatute. Fairminded jurists could conclude that a state\nsupreme court decision of that order is not \u201cunexpected\nand indefensible by reference to [existing] law.\u201d Rogers,\n532 U. S., at 462 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nLancaster therefore is not entitled to federal habeas relief\non his due process claim.\n                       *     *   *\n For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit is\n                                            Reversed.\n</pre>",
