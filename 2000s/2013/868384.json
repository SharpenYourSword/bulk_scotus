FEDERAL \n\n       COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u20131545. Argued January 16, 2013\u2014Decided May 20, 2013*\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires state or local\n  governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities \u201cwith-\n  in a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.\u201d 47\n  U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). Relying on its broad authority to implement\n  the Communications Act, see 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b), the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) issued a Declaratory Ruling conclud-\n  ing that the phrase \u201creasonable period of time\u201d is presumptively (but\n  rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna\n  on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications.\n  The cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, sought review of the\n  Declaratory Ruling in the Fifth Circuit. They argued that the Com-\n  mission lacked authority to interpret \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)\u2019s limitations. The\n  Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent holding that Chevron\n  U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n  837, applies to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own statutory juris-\n  diction, applied Chevron to that question. Finding the statute am-\n  biguous, it upheld as a permissible construction of the statute the\n  FCC\u2019s view that \u00a7201(b)\u2019s broad grant of regulatory authority em-\n  powered it to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B).\nHeld: Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agency\u2019s inter-\n pretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the\n agency\u2019s statutory authority (i.e., its jurisdiction). Pp. 4\u201317.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 11\u20131547, Cable, Telecommunications, and Tech-\nnology Committee of New Orleans City Council v. Federal Communica-\ntions Commission, also on certiorari to the same court.\n2                          ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Under Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask whether Con-\n    gress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if so, the\n    court must give effect to Congress\u2019 unambiguously expressed intent.\n    467 U. S., at 842\u2013843. However, if \u201cthe statute is silent or ambigu-\n    ous,\u201d the court must defer to the administering agency\u2019s construction\n    of the statute so long as it is permissible. Id., at 843. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) When a court reviews an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it\n    administers, the question is always, simply, whether the agency has\n    stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority. There is no dis-\n    tinction between an agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d\n    interpretations. The \u201cjurisdictional-nonjurisdictional\u201d line is mean-\n    ingful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell\n    the courts what classes of cases they may decide\u2014that is, to define\n    their jurisdiction\u2014but not to prescribe how they decide those cases.\n    But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes,\n    both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively pre-\n    scribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than\n    when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.\n    Because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond\n    what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for\n    carving out an arbitrary subset of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d questions from the\n    Chevron framework. See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications\n    Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333, 339. Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (c) This Court has consistently afforded Chevron deference to agen-\n    cies\u2019 constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\n    Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833;\n    United States v. Eurodif S. A., 555 U. S. 305, 316. Chevron applies to\n    statutes designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion, see Chem-\n    ical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 470 U. S.\n    116, 123, and even where concerns about agency self-aggrandizement\n    are at their apogee\u2014i.e., where an agency\u2019s expansive construction of\n    the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental\n    change in the regulatory scheme, see FDA v. Brown & Williamson\n    Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132. Pp. 10\u201314.\n       (d) The contention that Chevron deference is not appropriate here\n    because the FCC asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional\n    state and local concern is meritless. These cases have nothing to do\n    with federalism: The statute explicitly supplants state authority, so\n    the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will\n    draw the lines to which the States must hew. P. 14.\n       (e) United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, requires that, for\n    Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congres-\n    sional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the\n    particular manner adopted. But Mead denied Chevron deference to\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

There is no case in which a general conferral of rulemaking\n  or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chev-\n  ron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency\u2019s\n  substantive field. A general conferral of rulemaking authority vali-\n  dates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administer-\n  ing. It suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference\n  under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously\n  vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communi-\n  cations Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency in-\n  terpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authori-\n  ty.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                           I\n  Wireless telecommunications networks require towers\nand antennas; proposed sites for those towers and anten-\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnas must be approved by local zoning authorities. In the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \u201cimpose[d]\nspecific limitations on the traditional authority of state\nand local governments to regulate the location, construc-\ntion, and modification of such facilities,\u201d Rancho Palos\nVerdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, 115 (2005), and incorpo-\nrated those limitations into the Communications Act of\n1934, see 110 Stat. 56, 151. Section 201(b) of that Act\nempowers the Federal Communications Commission to\n\u201cprescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary\nin the public interest to carry out [its] provisions.\u201d Ch.\n296, 52 Stat. 588, codified at 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b). Of\ncourse, that rulemaking authority extends to the subse-\nquently added portions of the Act. See AT&T Corp. v.\nIowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 377\u2013378 (1999).\n   The Act imposes five substantive limitations, which are\ncodified in 47 U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B); only one of them,\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), is at issue here. That provision requires\nstate or local governments to act on wireless siting appli-\ncations \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time after the re-\nquest is duly filed.\u201d Two other features of \u00a7332(c)(7) are\nrelevant. First, subparagraph (A), known as the \u201csaving\nclause,\u201d provides that nothing in the Act, except those\nlimitations provided in \u00a7332(c)(7)(B), \u201cshall limit or affect\nthe authority of a State or local government\u201d over siting\ndecisions. Second, \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(v) authorizes a person\nwho believes a state or local government\u2019s wireless-siting\ndecision to be inconsistent with any of the limitations in\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B) to \u201ccommence an action in any court of com-\npetent jurisdiction.\u201d\n   In theory, \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires state and local\nzoning authorities to take prompt action on siting applica-\ntions for wireless facilities. But in practice, wireless pro-\nviders often faced long delays. In July 2008, CTIA\u2014The\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nWireless Association,1 which represents wireless service\nproviders, petitioned the FCC to clarify the meaning of\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u2019s requirement that zoning authorities act\non siting requests \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time.\u201d In\nNovember 2009, the Commission, relying on its broad\nstatutory authority to implement the provisions of the\nCommunications Act, issued a declaratory ruling respond-\ning to CTIA\u2019s petition. In re Petition for Declaratory Rul-\ning, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994, 14001. The Commission found\nthat the \u201crecord evidence demonstrates that unreasonable\ndelays in the personal wireless service facility siting\nprocess have obstructed the provision of wireless services\u201d\nand that such delays \u201cimpede the promotion of ad-\nvanced services and competition that Congress deemed\ncritical in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\u201d Id., at\n14006, 14008.       A \u201creasonable period of time\u201d under\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), the Commission determined, is presump-\ntively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process a collocation\napplication (that is, an application to place a new antenna\non an existing tower) and 150 days to process all other\napplications. Id., at 14005.\n   Some state and local governments opposed adoption of\nthe Declaratory Ruling on the ground that the Commis-\nsion lacked \u201cauthority to interpret ambiguous provisions of\nSection 332(c)(7).\u201d Id., at 14000. Specifically, they argued\nthat the saving clause, \u00a7332(c)(7)(A), and the judicial\nreview provision, \u00a7337(c)(7)(B)(v), together display a con-\ngressional intent to withhold from the Commission author-\nity to interpret the limitations in \u00a7332(c)(7)(B). Asserting\nthat ground of objection, the cities of Arlington and San\nAntonio, Texas, petitioned for review of the Declaratory\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 This is not a typographical error. CTIA\u2014The Wireless Association\n\nwas the name of the petitioner. CTIA is presumably an (unpronounce-\nable) acronym, but even the organization\u2019s website does not say what it\nstands for. That secret, known only to wireless-service-provider insid-\ners, we will not disclose here.\n4                     ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nRuling in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n   Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals held\nthat the Chevron framework applied to the threshold\nquestion whether the FCC possessed statutory authority\nto adopt the 90- and 150-day timeframes. 668 F. 3d 229,\n248 (CA5 2012) (citing Texas v. United States, 497 F. 3d\n491, 501 (CA5 2007)). Applying Chevron, the Court of\nAppeals found \u201c\u00a7332(c)(7)(A)\u2019s effect on the FCC\u2019s author-\nity to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)\u2019s limitations ambiguous,\u201d\n668 F. 3d, at 250, and held that \u201cthe FCC\u2019s interpretation\nof its statutory authority\u201d was a permissible construction\nof the statute. Id., at 254. On the merits, the court upheld\nthe presumptive 90- and 150-day deadlines as a \u201cpermis-\nsible construction of \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) . . . entitled to\nChevron deference.\u201d Id., at 256.\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), limited to\nthe first question presented: \u201cWhether . . . a court should\napply Chevron to . . . an agency\u2019s determination of its own\njurisdiction.\u201d Pet. for Cert. in No. 11\u20131545, p. i.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  As this case turns on the scope of the doctrine enshrined\nin Chevron, we begin with a description of that case\u2019s now-\ncanonical formulation. \u201cWhen a court reviews an agency\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute which it administers, it is\nconfronted with two questions.\u201d 467 U. S., at 842. First,\napplying the ordinary tools of statutory construction, the\ncourt must determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of\nCongress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the\ncourt, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unam-\nbiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 842\u2013843.\nBut \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to\nthe specific issue, the question for the court is whether the\nagency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute.\u201d Id., at 843.\n  Chevron is rooted in a background presumption of con-\ngressional intent: namely, \u201cthat Congress, when it left\nambiguity in a statute\u201d administered by an agency, \u201cun-\nderstood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and\nforemost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather\nthan the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion\nthe ambiguity allows.\u201d Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),\nN. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741 (1996). Chevron thus pro-\nvides a stable background rule against which Congress\ncan legislate: Statutory ambiguities will be resolved,\nwithin the bounds of reasonable interpretation, not by the\ncourts but by the administering agency. See Iowa Utilities\nBd., 525 U. S., at 397. Congress knows to speak in plain\nterms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious\nterms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.\n                               B\n   The question here is whether a court must defer under\nChevron to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory ambi-\nguity that concerns the scope of the agency\u2019s statutory\nauthority (that is, its jurisdiction). The argument against\ndeference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct\nclasses of agency interpretations: Some interpretations\u2014\nthe big, important ones, presumably\u2014define the agency\u2019s\n\u201cjurisdiction.\u201d Others\u2014humdrum, run-of-the-mill stuff\u2014\nare simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly\nhas. That premise is false, because the distinction be-\ntween \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d interpreta-\ntions is a mirage. No matter how it is framed, the question\na court faces when confronted with an agency\u2019s inter-\npretation of a statute it administers is always, simply,\nwhether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its\nstatutory authority.\n   The misconception that there are, for Chevron purposes,\nseparate \u201cjurisdictional\u201d questions on which no deference\n6                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis due derives, perhaps, from a reflexive extension to agen-\ncies of the very real division between the jurisdictional\nand nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts. In the\njudicial context, there is a meaningful line: Whether the\ncourt decided correctly is a question that has different\nconsequences from the question whether it had the power\nto decide at all. Congress has the power (within limits) to\ntell the courts what classes of cases they may decide, see\nTrainmen v. Toledo, P. & W. R. Co., 321 U. S. 50, 63\u201364\n(1944); Lauf v. E. G. Shinner & Co., 303 U. S. 323, 330\n(1938), but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide\nthose cases, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218\u2013219 (1995). A court\u2019s power to decide a case is\nindependent of whether its decision is correct, which is\nwhy even an erroneous judgment is entitled to res judicata\neffect. Put differently, a jurisdictionally proper but sub-\nstantively incorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.\n   That is not so for agencies charged with administering\ncongressional statutes. Both their power to act and how\nthey are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress,\nso that when they act improperly, no less than when they\nact beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.\nBecause the question\u2014whether framed as an incorrect\napplication of agency authority or an assertion of author-\nity not conferred\u2014is always whether the agency has gone\nbeyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no\nprincipled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of\nsuch claims as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n   An example will illustrate just how illusory the pro-\nposed line between \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d\nagency interpretations is. Imagine the following validly-\nenacted statute:\n    COMMON CARRIER ACT\n    SECTION 1. The Agency shall have jurisdiction to pro-\n    hibit any common carrier from imposing an unreason-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    able condition upon access to its facilities.\nThere is no question that this provision\u2014including the\nterms \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condition\u201d\u2014\ndefines the Agency\u2019s jurisdiction. Surely, the argument\ngoes, a court must determine de novo the scope of that\njurisdiction.\n  Consider, however, this alternative formulation of the\nstatute:\n    COMMON CARRIER ACT\n    SECTION 1. No common carrier shall impose an un-\n    reasonable condition upon access to its facilities.\n    SECTION 2. The Agency may prescribe rules and regu-\n    lations necessary in the public interest to effectuate\n    Section 1 of this Act.\nNow imagine that the Agency, invoking its Section 2\nauthority, promulgates this Rule: \u201c(1) The term \u2018common\ncarrier\u2019 in Section 1 includes Internet Service Providers.\n(2) The term \u2018unreasonable condition\u2019 in Section 1 includes\nunreasonably high prices. (3) A monthly fee greater than\n$25 is an unreasonable condition on access to Internet\nservice.\u201d By this Rule, the Agency has claimed for itself\njurisdiction that is doubly questionable: Does its authority\nextend to Internet Service Providers? And does it extend\nto setting prices? Yet Section 2 makes clear that Con-\ngress, in petitioners\u2019 words, \u201cconferred interpretive power\non the agency\u201d with respect to Section 1. Brief for Peti-\ntioners in No. 1545, p. 14. Even under petitioners\u2019 theory,\nthen, a court should defer to the Agency\u2019s interpretation of\nthe terms \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condi-\ntion\u201d\u2014that is to say, its assertion that its \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\nextends to regulating Internet Service Providers and\nsetting prices.\n   In the first case, by contrast, petitioners\u2019 theory would\naccord the agency no deference. The trouble with this is\nthat in both cases, the underlying question is exactly the\n8                         ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsame: Does the statute give the agency authority to regu-\nlate Internet Service Providers and cap prices, or not?2\nThe reality, laid bare, is that there is no difference, insofar\nas the validity of agency action is concerned, between an\nagency\u2019s exceeding the scope of its authority (its \u201cjurisdic-\ntion\u201d) and its exceeding authorized application of authority\nthat it unquestionably has. \u201cTo exceed authorized applica-\ntion is to exceed authority. Virtually any administrative\naction can be characterized as either the one or the other,\ndepending on how generally one wishes to describe the\n\u2018authority.\u2019 \u201d Mississippi Power & Light Co. v.

Rev. 1, 29 (1983)\n(\u201cAdministrative application of law is administrative\nformulation of law whenever it involves elaboration of the\nstatutory norm.\u201d).\n   This point is nicely illustrated by our decision in Na-\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf\nPower Co., 534 U. S. 327 (2002). That case considered\nwhether the FCC\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to regulate the rents\nutility-pole owners charge for \u201cpole attachments\u201d (defined\nas attachments by a cable television system or provider of\ntelecommunications service) extended to attachments that\nprovided both cable television and high-speed Internet\naccess (attachments for so-called \u201ccommingled services\u201d).\nId., at 331\u2013336.

The two statutes are substantively\nidentical. Any difference in outcome would be arbitrary, so a sound\ninterpretive approach should yield none.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

One of\nthe briefs in support of petitioners explains, helpfully, that\n\u201c[j]urisdictional questions concern the who, what, where,\nand when of regulatory power: which subject matters may\nan agency regulate and under what conditions.\u201d Brief for\nIMLA Respondents 18\u201319. But an agency\u2019s application of\nits authority pursuant to statutory text answers the same\nquestions. Who is an \u201coutside salesman\u201d? What is a \u201cpole\nattachment\u201d? Where do the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d\nend? When must a Medicare provider challenge a reim-\nbursement determination in order to be entitled to an\nadministrative appeal? These can all be reframed as ques-\ntions about the scope of agencies\u2019 regulatory jurisdiction\u2014\nand they are all questions to which the Chevron\nframework applies. See Christopher v.

See H. Edwards & L. Elliott,\n10                    ARLINGTON v.

Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a73.5, p.\n187 (2010). One of our opinions explicitly says that no\n\u201cexception exists to the normal [deferential] standard of\nreview\u201d for \u201c \u2018jurisdictional or legal question[s] concerning\nthe coverage\u2019 \u201d of an Act. NLRB v. City Disposal Systems,\nInc., 465 U. S. 822, 830, n. 7 (1984). A prime example of\ndeferential review for questions of jurisdiction is Commod-\nity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833\n(1986). That case involved a CFTC interpretation of 7\nU. S.

The CFTC,\npursuant to its broad rulemaking authority, see \u00a712a(5),\ninterpreted that oblique reference to counterclaims as\ngranting it \u201cthe power to take jurisdiction over\u201d not just\nfederal-law counterclaims, but state-law counterclaims as\nwell.

Barrett, 494\nU. S. 638 (1990), see post, at 8\u20139, is misplaced. In that case, the De-\npartment of Labor had interpreted a statute creating a private right of\naction for migrant or seasonal farmworkers as providing no remedy\nwhere a state workers\u2019-compensation law covered the worker. 494\nU. S., at 649. We held that we had no need to \u201cdefer to the Secretary of\nLabor\u2019s view of the scope of\u201d that private right of action \u201cbecause\nCongress has expressly established the Judiciary and not the Depart-\nment of Labor as the adjudicator of private rights of action arising\nunder the statute.\u201d Ibid. Adams Fruit stands for the modest proposi-\ntion that the Judiciary, not any executive agency, determines \u201cthe\nscope\u201d\u2014including the available remedies\u2014\u201cof judicial power vested by\u201d\nstatutes establishing private rights of action. Id., at 650. Adams Fruit\nexplicitly affirmed the Department\u2019s authority to promulgate the\nsubstantive standards enforced through that private right of action.\nSee ibid.\n   The dissent\u2019s invocation of Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006),\nsee post, at 10\u201311, is simply perplexing: The majority opinion in that\n12                      ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our cases hold that Chevron applies equally to statutes\ndesigned to curtail the scope of agency discretion. For\ninstance, in Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 470 U. S. 116, 123 (1985), we con-\nsidered a statute prohibiting the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency from \u201cmodify[ing] any requirement of this\nsection as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on\nthe toxic pollutant list.\u201d The EPA construed the statute as\nnot precluding it from granting variances with respect to\ncertain toxic pollutants. Finding no \u201cclear congressional\nintent to forbid EPA\u2019s sensible variance mechanism,\u201d id.,\nat 134, we deferred to the EPA\u2019s construction of this ex-\npress limitation on its own regulatory authority, id., at\n125 (citing Chevron, 467 U. S. 837); see also, e.g., Japan\nWhaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221,\n226, 232\u2013234 (1986).\n   The U. S. Reports are shot through with applications of\nChevron to agencies\u2019 constructions of the scope of their\nown jurisdiction. And we have applied Chevron where\nconcerns about agency self-aggrandizement are at their\napogee: in cases where an agency\u2019s expansive construction\nof the extent of its own power would have wrought a fun-\ndamental change in the regulatory scheme. In FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120 (2000),\nthe threshold question was the \u201cappropriate framework for\nanalyzing\u201d the FDA\u2019s assertion of \u201cjurisdiction to regulate\ntobacco products,\u201d id., at 126, 132\u2014a question of vast\n\u201ceconomic and political magnitude,\u201d id., at 133. \u201cBecause\nthis case involves an administrative agency\u2019s construction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncase expressly lists the Communications Act as an example of a statute\nunder which an agency\u2019s \u201cauthority is clear because the statute gives\nan agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.\u201d 546\nU. S., at 258\u2013259 (citing 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b); emphasis added). That\nstatement cannot be squared with the dissent\u2019s proposed remand for\nthe Fifth Circuit to determine \u201cwhether Congress delegated interpre-\ntive authority over \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) to the FCC.\u201d Post, at 18.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Similarly, in MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.\n218, 224, 229, 231 (1994), we applied the Chevron frame-\nwork to the FCC\u2019s assertion that the statutory phrase\n\u201cmodify any requirement\u201d gave it authority to eliminate\nrate-filing requirements, \u201cthe essential characteristic of a\nrate-regulated industry,\u201d for long-distance telephone\ncarriers.\n   The false dichotomy between \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnon-\njurisdictional\u201d agency interpretations may be no more\nthan a bogeyman, but it is dangerous all the same. Like\nthe Hound of the Baskervilles, it is conjured by those with\ngreater quarry in sight: Make no mistake\u2014the ultimate\ntarget here is Chevron itself. Savvy challengers of agency\naction would play the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d card in every case.\nSee, e.g., Cellco Partnership v. FCC, 700 F. 3d 534,\n541 (CADC 2012). Some judges would be deceived by\nthe specious, but scary-sounding, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d-\n\u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d line; others tempted by the prospect of\nmaking public policy by prescribing the meaning of am-\nbiguous statutory commands. The effect would be to\ntransfer any number of interpretive decisions\u2014archetypal\nChevron questions, about how best to construe an ambigu-\nous term in light of competing policy interests\u2014from the\nagencies that administer the statutes to federal courts.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s discomfort with the growth of agency power,\nsee post, at 2\u20134, is perhaps understandable. But the dissent overstates\nwhen it claims that agencies exercise \u201clegislative power\u201d and \u201cjudicial\npower.\u201d Post, at 2; see also post, at 16. The former is vested exclusively\nin Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a71, the latter in the \u201cone supreme\nCourt\u201d and \u201csuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time\nordain and establish,\u201d Art. III, \u00a71. Agencies make rules (\u201cPrivate cattle\nmay be grazed on public lands X, Y, and Z subject to certain condi-\ntions\u201d) and conduct adjudications (\u201cThis rancher\u2019s grazing permit is\nrevoked for violation of the conditions\u201d) and have done so since the\nbeginning of the Republic. These activities take \u201clegislative\u201d and\n14                       ARLINGTON v.

Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S.\n555, 568 (1980). That is precisely what Chevron prevents.\n                             III\n                              A\n  One group of respondents contends that Chevron defer-\nence is inappropriate here because the FCC has \u201cas-\nsert[ed] jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and\nlocal concern.\u201d Brief for IMLA Respondents 35. But this\ncase has nothing to do with federalism.             Section\n332(c)(7)(B)(ii) explicitly supplants state authority by\nrequiring zoning authorities to render a decision \u201cwithin a\nreasonable period of time,\u201d and the meaning of that phrase\nis indisputably a question of federal law. We rejected a\nsimilar faux-federalism argument in the Iowa Utilities\nBoard case, in terms that apply equally here: \u201cThis is, at\nbottom, a debate not about whether the States will be\nallowed to do their own thing, but about whether it will be\nthe FCC or the federal courts that draw the lines to which\nthey must hew.\u201d 525 U.

Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218 (2001), requires that, for Chevron deference\nto apply, the agency must have received congressional\nauthority to determine the particular matter at issue in\nthe particular manner adopted. No one disputes that.\nBut Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency\nwith rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking.\nWhat the dissent needs, and fails to produce, is a single\ncase in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudi-\ncative authority has been held insufficient to support\nChevron deference for an exercise of that authority within\nthe agency\u2019s substantive field. There is no such case, and\nwhat the dissent proposes is a massive revision of our\nChevron jurisprudence.\n  Where we differ from the dissent is in its apparent\nrejection of the theorem that the whole includes all of its\nparts\u2014its view that a general conferral of rulemaking\nauthority does not validate rules for all the matters the\nagency is charged with administering. Rather, the dissent\nproposes that even when general rulemaking authority is\nclear, every agency rule must be subjected to a de novo\njudicial determination of whether the particular issue was\ncommitted to agency discretion. It offers no standards at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u201cmisunderstand[ing]\u201d the question presented as one of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d \n\nPost, at 5.

FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall to guide this open-ended hunt for congressional intent\n(that is to say, for evidence of congressional intent more\nspecific than the conferral of general rulemaking author-\nity). It would simply punt that question back to the Court\nof Appeals, presumably for application of some sort of\ntotality-of-the-circumstances test\u2014which is really, of\ncourse, not a test at all but an invitation to make an\nad hoc judgment regarding congressional intent. Thirteen\nCourts of Appeals applying a totality-of-the-circumstances\ntest would render the binding effect of agency rules un-\npredictable and destroy the whole stabilizing purpose of\nChevron. The excessive agency power that the dissent\nfears would be replaced by chaos. There is no need to\nwade into these murky waters. It suffices to decide this\ncase that the preconditions to deference under Chevron\nare satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested\nthe FCC with general authority to administer the Com-\nmunications Act through rulemaking and adjudication,\nand the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.\n                         *    *    *\n     Those who assert that applying Chevron to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d interpretations \u201cleaves the fox in charge of the\nhenhouse\u201d overlook the reality that a separate category of\n\u201cjurisdictional\u201d interpretations does not exist. The fox-in-\nthe-henhouse syndrome is to be avoided not by estab-\nlishing an arbitrary and undefinable category of agency\ndecisionmaking that is accorded no deference, but by taking\nseriously, and applying rigorously, in all cases, statutory\nlimits on agencies\u2019 authority. Where Congress has estab-\nlished a clear line, the agency cannot go beyond it; and\nwhere Congress has established an ambiguous line, the\nagency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly\nallow.

In this context, \u201cthe distinction\nbetween \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 and \u2018non-jurisdictional\u2019 interpreta-\ntions is a mirage.\u201d Ante, at 5.\n   Deciding just what those statutory bounds are, however,\nis not always an easy matter, and the Court\u2019s case law\nabounds with discussion of the subject. A reviewing judge,\nfor example, will have to decide independently whether\nCongress delegated authority to the agency to provide\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ninterpretations of, or to enact rules pursuant to, the stat-\nute at issue\u2014interpretations or rules that carry with them\n\u201cthe force of law.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S.\n218, 229 (2001). If so, the reviewing court must give spe-\ncial leeway or \u201cdeference\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation.\nSee id., at 227\u2013228.\n  We have added that, if \u201c[e]mploying traditional tools of\nstatutory construction,\u201d INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S.\n421, 446 (1987), the court determines that Congress has\nspoken clearly on the disputed question, then \u201cthat is the\nend of the matter,\u201d Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).\nThe agency is due no deference, for Congress has left no\ngap for the agency to fill. Id., at 842\u2013844. If, on the other\nhand, Congress has not spoken clearly, if, for example it\nhas written ambiguously, then that ambiguity is a sign\u2014\nbut not always a conclusive sign\u2014that Congress intends a\nreviewing court to pay particular attention to (i.e., to give\na degree of deference to) the agency\u2019s interpretation. See\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 258\u2013269 (2006); Mead,\nsupra, at 229.\n  I say that the existence of statutory ambiguity is some-\ntimes not enough to warrant the conclusion that Congress\nhas left a deference-warranting gap for the agency to fill be-\ncause our cases make clear that other, sometimes context-\nspecific, factors will on occasion prove relevant. (And,\ngiven the vast number of government statutes, regulatory\nprograms, and underlying circumstances, that variety is\nhardly surprising.) In Mead, for example, we looked to\nseveral factors other than simple ambiguity to help deter-\nmine whether Congress left a statutory gap, thus delegat-\ning to the agency the authority to fill that gap with an\ninterpretation that would carry \u201cthe force of law.\u201d 533\nU.

Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n    222 (2002).\nThe subject matter of the relevant provision\u2014for instance,\nits distance from the agency\u2019s ordinary statutory duties or\nits falling within the scope of another agency\u2019s authority\u2014\nhas also proved relevant.

Rev. 989, 1007\u20131010\n(1999).\n   Moreover, the statute\u2019s text, its context, the structure of\nthe statutory scheme, and canons of textual construction\nare relevant in determining whether the statute is ambig-\nuous and can be equally helpful in determining whether\nsuch ambiguity comes accompanied with agency authority\nto fill a gap with an interpretation that carries the force of\nlaw. See Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541\nU. S. 232, 239\u2013242 (2004); Zuni Public School Dist. No. 89\nv. Department of Education, 550 U. S. 81, 98\u201399 (2007);\nFDA v.

FCC\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\napproximate how Congress would likely have meant to\nallocate interpretive law-determining authority between\nreviewing court and agency. The question whether Con-\ngress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide\nan interpretation that carries the force of law is for the\njudge to answer independently. The judge, considering\n\u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction,\u201d Cardoza-\nFonseca, supra, at 446, will ask whether Congress has\nspoken unambiguously. If so, the text controls. If not, the\njudge will ask whether Congress would have intended the\nagency to resolve the resulting ambiguity. If so, deference\nis warranted. See Mead, supra, at 229. Even if not, how-\never, sometimes an agency interpretation, in light of the\nagency\u2019s special expertise, will still have the \u201cpower to\npersuade, if lacking power to control,\u201d Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n   The case before us offers an example. The relevant\nstatutory provision requires state or local governments to\nact on wireless siting applications \u201cwithin a reasonable\nperiod of time after\u201d a wireless service provider files such\na request. 47 U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) argued that this pro-\nvision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the\namount of time that is reasonable. Many factors favor the\nagency\u2019s view: (1) the language of the Telecommunications\nAct grants the FCC broad authority (including rulemaking\nauthority) to administer the Act; (2) the words are open-\nended\u2014i.e. \u201cambiguous\u201d; (3) the provision concerns an\ninterstitial administrative matter, in respect to which the\nagency\u2019s expertise could have an important role to play;\nand (4) the matter, in context, is complex, likely making\nthe agency\u2019s expertise useful in helping to answer the \u201crea-\nsonableness\u201d question that the statute poses. See \u00a7151\n(creating the FCC); \u00a7201(b) (providing rulemaking auth-\nority); National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U.

S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n(acknowledging the FCC\u2019s authority to administer the\nAct).\n   On the other side of the coin, petitioners point to two\nstatutory provisions which, they believe, require a differ-\nent conclusion\u2014namely, that the FCC lacked authority\naltogether to interpret \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). First, a nearby\nsaving clause says: \u201cExcept as provided in this paragraph,\nnothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority\nof a State or local government or instrumentality thereof\nover decisions regarding the placement, construction, and\nmodification of personal wireless service facilities.\u201d\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(A). Second, a judicial review provision, says:\n\u201cAny person adversely affected by any final action or\nfailure to act by a State or local government or any in-\nstrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this sub-\nparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure\nto act, commence an action in any court of competent\njurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n   In my view, however, these two provisions cannot pro-\nvide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by\npetitioners. The first provision begins with an exception,\nstating that it does not apply to (among other things) the\n\u201creasonableness\u201d provision here at issue. The second sim-\nply sets forth a procedure for judicial review, a review\nthat applies to most government actions. Both are con-\nsistent with a statutory scheme that gives States, locali-\nties, the FCC, and reviewing courts each some role to play\nin the location of wireless service facilities. And neither\n\u201cexpressly describ[es] an exception\u201d to the FCC\u2019s plenary\nauthority to interpret the Act. American Hospital Assn. v.\nNLRB, 499 U. S. 606, 613 (1991).\n   For these reasons, I would reject petitioners\u2019 argument\nand conclude that \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u2014the \u201creasonableness\u201d\nstatute\u2014leaves a gap for the FCC to fill. I would hold that\nthe FCC\u2019s lawful efforts to do so carry \u201cthe force of law.\u201d\nMead, 533 U. S., at 229. The Court of Appeals ultimately\n6                   ARLINGTON v.

It is\nalso easily expressed: A court should not defer to an agency\nuntil the court decides, on its own, that the agency is\nentitled to deference. Courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpre-\ntation of law when and because Congress has conferred on\nthe agency interpretive authority over the question at\nissue. An agency cannot exercise interpretive authority\nuntil it has it; the question whether an agency enjoys that\nauthority must be decided by a court, without deference to\nthe agency.\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                               I\n\n   One of the principal authors of the Constitution famously\nwrote that the \u201caccumulation of all powers, legislative,\nexecutive, and judiciary, in the same hands, . . . may justly\nbe pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d The Feder-\nalist No. 47, p. 324 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\nAlthough modern administrative agencies fit most com-\nfortably within the Executive Branch, as a practical matter\nthey exercise legislative power, by promulgating regula-\ntions with the force of law; executive power, by policing\ncompliance with those regulations; and judicial power, by\nadjudicating enforcement actions and imposing sanctions\non those found to have violated their rules. The accumula-\ntion of these powers in the same hands is not an occasional\nor isolated exception to the constitutional plan; it is a\ncentral feature of modern American government.\n   The administrative state \u201cwields vast power and touches\nalmost every aspect of daily life.\u201d Free Enterprise Fund v.\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). The Framers could hardly have\nenvisioned today\u2019s \u201cvast and varied federal bureaucracy\u201d\nand the authority administrative agencies now hold over\nour economic, social, and political activities. Ibid. \u201c[T]he\nadministrative state with its reams of regulations would\nleave them rubbing their eyes.\u201d Alden v. Maine, 527 U.

And the federal bureaucracy con-\ntinues to grow; in the last 15 years, Congress has launched\nmore than 50 new agencies. Compare Office of the Federal\nRegister, United States Government Manual 1997/1998,\nwith Office of the Federal Register, United States Gov-\nernment Manual 2012. And more are on the way.

As\nscholars have noted, \u201cno President (or his executive office\nstaff) could, and presumably none would wish to, super-\nvise so broad a swath of regulatory activity.\u201d Kagan,\nPresidential Administration, 114 Harv.

President Truman\ncolorfully described his power over the administrative\nstate by complaining, \u201cI thought I was the president, but\nwhen it comes to these bureaucrats, I can\u2019t do a damn\nthing.\u201d See R. Nathan, The Administrative Presidency 2\n(1986). President Kennedy once told a constituent, \u201cI\nagree with you, but I don\u2019t know if the government will.\u201d\nSee id., at 1. The collection of agencies housed outside the\ntraditional executive departments, including the Federal\nCommunications Commission, is routinely described as\nthe \u201cheadless fourth branch of government,\u201d reflecting not\nonly the scope of their authority but their practical inde-\npendence. See, e.g., Administrative Conference of United\nStates, D. Lewis & J. Selin, Sourcebook of United States\nExecutive Agencies 11 (2012).\n   As for judicial oversight, agencies enjoy broad power to\nconstrue statutory provisions over which they have been\ngiven interpretive authority. In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., we established a\ntest for reviewing \u201can agency\u2019s construction of the statute\nwhich it administers.\u201d 467 U.

Congressional delegations to\nagencies are often ambiguous\u2014expressing \u201ca mood rather\nthan a message.\u201d Friendly, The Federal Administrative\nAgencies: The Need for Better Definition of Standards, 75\nHarv. L. Rev. 1263, 1311 (1962). By design or default,\nCongress often fails to speak to \u201cthe precise question\u201d\nbefore an agency. In the absence of such an answer, an\nagency\u2019s interpretation has the full force and effect of law,\nunless it \u201cexceeds the bounds of the permissible.\u201d Barn-\nhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 218 (2002).\n   It would be a bit much to describe the result as \u201cthe very\ndefinition of tyranny,\u201d but the danger posed by the grow-\ning power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed.\nSee, e.g., Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone\nCo., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 3) (noting that the FCC \u201chas repeatedly been re-\nbuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its\ntext, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same\nends\u201d); Sackett v.

And with hundreds of federal agencies poking into\nevery nook and cranny of daily life, that citizen might also\nunderstandably question whether Presidential oversight\u2014\na critical part of the Constitutional plan\u2014is always an\neffective safeguard against agency overreaching.\n   It is against this background that we consider whether\nthe authority of administrative agencies should be aug-\nmented even further, to include not only broad power to\ngive definitive answers to questions left to them by Con-\ngress, but also the same power to decide when Congress\nhas given them that power.\n   Before proceeding to answer that question, however, it\nis necessary to sort through some confusion over what this\nlitigation is about. The source of the confusion is a famil-\niar culprit: the concept of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d which we have\nrepeatedly described as a word with \u201c \u2018many, too many,\nmeanings.\u2019 \u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,\n558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009).\n   The Court states that the question \u201cis whether a court\nmust defer under Chevron to an agency\u2019s interpretation of\na statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agen-\ncy\u2019s statutory authority (that is, its jurisdiction).\u201d Ante, at\n5. That is fine\u2014until the parenthetical. The parties,\namici, and court below too often use the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\nimprecisely, which leads the Court to misunderstand the\nargument it must confront. That argument is not that\n\u201cthere exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,\u201d\nsome \u201cbig, important ones\u201d that \u201cdefine the agency\u2019s \u2018juris-\ndiction,\u2019 \u201d and other \u201chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\u201d ones that\n\u201care simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly\nhas.\u201d Ibid. The argument is instead that a court should\nnot defer to an agency on whether Congress has granted\nthe agency interpretive authority over the statutory ambi-\nguity at issue.\n   You can call that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d if you\u2019d like, as petition-\ners do in the question presented. But given that the term\n6                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nis ambiguous, more is required to understand its use in\nthat question than simply \u201chaving read it.\u201d Ante, at 15,\nn. 5. It is important to keep in mind that the term, in the\npresent context, has the more precise meaning noted\nabove, encompassing congressionally delegated authority\nto issue interpretations with the force and effect of law.\nSee 668 F. 3d 229, 248 (CA5 2012) (case below) (\u201cThe issue\nin the instant case is whether the FCC possessed statutory\nauthority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) by adopt-\ning the 90- and 150-day time frames\u201d).

In Chevron, the EPA promulgated a regu-\nlation interpreting the term \u201cstationary sources\u201d in the\nClean Air Act. 467 U. S., at 840 (quoting 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77502(b)(6)(1982 ed.)). An environmental group petitioned\nfor review of the rule, challenging it as an impermissible\ninterpretation of the Act. 467 U. S., at 841, 859. Finding\nthe statutory text \u201cnot dispositive\u201d and the legislative\nhistory \u201csilent on the precise issue,\u201d we upheld the rule.\nId., at 862, 866.\n  In our view, the challenge to the agency\u2019s interpretation\n\u201ccenter[ed] on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather\nthan whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left\nopen by Congress.\u201d Id., at 866. Judges, we said, \u201care not\nexperts in the field, and are not part of either political\nbranch of the Government.\u201d Id., at 865. Thus, because\nCongress had not answered the specific question at issue,\njudges had no business providing their own resolution on\nthe basis of their \u201cpersonal policy preferences.\u201d Ibid.\nInstead, the \u201cagency to which Congress ha[d] delegated\npolicymaking responsibilities\u201d was the appropriate politi-\n8                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncal actor to resolve the competing interests at stake, \u201cwithin\nthe limits of that delegation.\u201d Ibid.\n  Chevron\u2019s rule of deference was based on\u2014and limited\nby\u2014this congressional delegation. And the Court did not\nask simply whether Congress had delegated to the EPA\nthe authority to administer the Clean Air Act generally.\nWe asked whether Congress had \u201cdelegat[ed] authority to\nthe agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute\nby regulation.\u201d Id., at 843\u2013844 (emphasis added); see id.,\nat 844 (discussing \u201cthe legislative delegation to an agency\non a particular question\u201d (emphasis added)). We deferred\nto the EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cstationary sources\u201d based\non our conclusion that the agency had been \u201ccharged with\nresponsibility for administering the provision.\u201d Id., at 865\n(emphasis added).\n                              B\n   We have never faltered in our understanding of this\nstraightforward principle, that whether a particular agency\ninterpretation warrants Chevron deference turns on the\ncourt\u2019s determination whether Congress has delegated to\nthe agency the authority to interpret the statutory ambi-\nguity at issue.\n   We made the point perhaps most clearly in Adams Fruit\nCo. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638 (1990). In that case, the\nDepartment of Labor contended the Court should defer to\nits interpretation of the scope of the private right of action\nprovided by the Migrant and Seasonal Agriculture Worker\nProtection Act (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a71854, against employ-\ners who intentionally violated the Act\u2019s motor vehicle\nsafety provisions. We refused to do so. Although \u201cas an\ninitial matter\u201d we rejected the idea that Congress left a\n\u201cstatutory \u2018gap\u2019 \u201d for the agency to fill, we reasoned that if\nthe \u201cAWPA\u2019s language establishing a private right of\naction is ambiguous,\u201d the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of its scope did not warrant Chevron deference. 494\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 649.\n   In language directly applicable to the question before us,\nwe explained that \u201c[a] precondition to deference under\nChevron is a congressional delegation of administrative\nauthority.\u201d Ibid. Although \u201cCongress clearly envisioned,\nindeed expressly mandated, a role for the Department of\nLabor in administering the statute by requiring the Secre-\ntary to promulgate standards implementing AWPA\u2019s\nmotor vehicle provisions,\u201d we found \u201c[n]o such delegation\nregarding AWPA\u2019s enforcement provisions.\u201d Id., at 650\n(emphasis added). It would therefore be \u201cinappropriate,\u201d\nwe said, \u201cto consult executive interpretations\u201d of the en-\nforcement provisions to resolve ambiguities \u201csurrounding\nthe scope of AWPA\u2019s judicially enforceable remedy.\u201d Ibid.\nWithout questioning the principle that agency determina-\ntions \u201cwithin the scope of delegated authority are entitled\nto deference,\u201d we explained that \u201cit is fundamental \u2018that\nan agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it\nhas no jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U. S. 726, 745 (1973)).\n   Our subsequent cases follow the same approach. In\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., supra, for example, Chevron\ndeference turned on whether Congress had delegated to\nthe agency authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity\nby a particular means. The Customs Service had issued a\n\u201cclassification ruling,\u201d interpreting the term \u201cdiaries\u201d in a\ntariff schedule to include \u201cday planners\u201d of the type Mead\nimported, and on that basis subjected the planners to a\nfour-percent tariff. Mead protested the imposition of the\ntariff, the Customs Service claimed Chevron deference for\nits interpretation, and the controversy made its way to our\nCourt. Id., at 224\u2013226.\n   In Mead, we again made clear that the \u201ccategory of\ninterpretative choices\u201d to which Chevron deference applies\nis defined by congressional intent. Id., at 229. Chevron\ndeference, we said, rests on a recognition that Congress\n10                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nhas delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to\nimplement \u201ca particular provision\u201d or answer \u201c \u2018a particu-\nlar question.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844).\nAn agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201ca particular statutory provi-\nsion\u201d thus qualifies for Chevron deference only \u201cwhen it\nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that\nthe agency interpretation claiming deference was pro-\nmulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d 533 U. S., at\n226\u2013227.\n   The Court did not defer to the agency\u2019s views but in-\nstead determined that Congress had not delegated inter-\npretive authority to the Customs Service to definitively\nconstrue the tariff schedule through classification rulings.\nNeither the statutory authorization for the classification\nrulings, nor the Customs Service\u2019s practice in issuing such\nrulings, \u201creasonably suggest[ed] that Congress ever\nthought of [such] classification rulings as deserving the\ndeference claimed for them.\u201d Id., at 231. And in the ab-\nsence of such a delegation, we concluded the interpreta-\ntions adopted in those rulings were \u201cbeyond the Chevron\npale.\u201d Id., at 234.\n   Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), is in the same\nline of precedent. In that case, as here, deference turned\non whether a congressional delegation of interpretive\nauthority reached a particular statutory ambiguity. The\nAttorney General claimed Chevron deference for his inter-\npretation of the phrase \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d in the\nControlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude the prescrib-\ning and dispensing of controlled substances for the pur-\npose of assisting suicide. Id., at 254, 258. No one disputed\nthat \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d was \u201cambiguous in the\nrelevant sense.\u201d Id., at 258. Nor did any Justice dispute\nthat the Attorney General had been granted the power in\nthe CSA to promulgate rules with the force of law. Ibid.;\nsee id., at 281 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt explained, \u201cChevron deference . . . is not accorded\nmerely because the statute is ambiguous and an adminis-\ntrative official is involved.\u201d Id., at 258. The regulation\nadvancing the interpretation, we said, \u201cmust be promul-\ngated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the\nofficial.\u201d Ibid. (citing Mead, supra, at 226\u2013227).\n   In the CSA, Congress delegated to the Attorney General\nthe authority to promulgate regulations \u201crelating to the\nregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution,\nand dispensing of controlled substances,\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7821,\nor \u201cfor the efficient execution of his functions under [the\nCSA],\u201d \u00a7871(b). After considering the text, structure, and\npurpose of the Act, the Court concluded on its own that\ninterpreting \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d fell under nei-\nther delegation. Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 258\u2013269. Because\nthe regulation \u201cwas not promulgated pursuant to the\nAttorney General\u2019s authority, its interpretation of \u2018legiti-\nmate medical purpose\u2019 d[id] not receive Chevron defer-\nence.\u201d Id., at 268.\n   Adams Fruit, Mead, and Gonzales thus confirm that\nChevron deference is based on, and finds legitimacy as, a\ncongressional delegation of interpretive authority. An\nagency interpretation warrants such deference only if\nCongress has delegated authority to definitively interpret\na particular ambiguity in a particular manner. Whether\nCongress has done so must be determined by the court on\nits own before Chevron can apply. See H. Edwards, L.\nElliot, & M. Levy, Federal Courts Standards of Review 168\n(2d ed. 2013) (\u201ca court decides de novo whether an agency\nhas acted within the bounds of congressionally delegated\nauthority\u201d (citing Mead, supra, at 226\u2013227, and Gonzales,\nsupra, at 258)); Sales & Adler, The Rest is Silence: Chevron\nDeference, Agency Jurisdiction, and Statutory Silences,\n2009 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1497, 1564 (2009) (\u201cif delegation\nreally is antecedent to deference, as Mead insists, it can-\nnot be that courts should defer to an agency\u2019s views on\n12                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nwhether a delegation has taken place\u201d).\n   In other words, we do not defer to an agency\u2019s interpre-\ntation of an ambiguous provision unless Congress wants\nus to, and whether Congress wants us to is a question that\ncourts, not agencies, must decide. Simply put, that ques-\ntion is \u201cbeyond the Chevron pale.\u201d Mead, supra, at 234.\n                              IV\n  Despite these precedents, the FCC argues that a court\nneed only locate an agency and a grant of general rule-\nmaking authority over a statute. Chevron deference then\napplies, it contends, to the agency\u2019s interpretation of any\nambiguity in the Act, including ambiguity in a provision\nsaid to carve out specific provisions from the agency\u2019s\ngeneral rulemaking authority. If Congress intends to\nexempt part of the statute from the agency\u2019s interpretive\nauthority, the FCC says, Congress \u201ccan ordinarily be\nexpected to state that intent explicitly.\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondents 30 (citing American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB,\n499 U. S. 606 (1991)).\n  If a congressional delegation of interpretive authority is\nto support Chevron deference, however, that delegation\nmust extend to the specific statutory ambiguity at issue.\nThe appropriate question is whether the delegation covers\nthe \u201cspecific provision\u201d and \u201cparticular question\u201d before\nthe court. Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844. A congressional\ngrant of authority over some portion of a statute does not\nnecessarily mean that Congress granted the agency inter-\npretive authority over all its provisions. See Adams Fruit,\n494 U. S., at 650.\n  An example that might highlight the point concerns\nstatutes that parcel out authority to multiple agencies,\nwhich \u201cmay be the norm, rather than an exception.\u201d\nGersen, Overlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in\nAdministrative Law, 2006 S. Ct. Rev. 201, 208; see, e.g.,\nGonzales, 546 U. S, at 250\u2013251 (describing shared author-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nity over the CSA between the Attorney General and the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services); Sutton v. United\nAir Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 478 (1999) (authority to\nissue regulations implementing the Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act \u201cis split primarily among three Government\nagencies\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, for example, authorizes rule-\nmaking by at least eight different agencies. See Con-\ngressional Research Service, C. Copeland, Rulemaking\nRequirements and Authorities in the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act 7 (2010).\nWhen presented with an agency\u2019s interpretation of such a\nstatute, a court cannot simply ask whether the statute is\none that the agency administers; the question is whether\nauthority over the particular ambiguity at issue has been\ndelegated to the particular agency.\n   By the same logic, even when Congress provides inter-\npretive authority to a single agency, a court must decide if\nthe ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with\nthe force of law is one to which the congressional delega-\ntion extends. A general delegation to the agency to admin-\nister the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that\nCongress has delegated interpretive authority over the\nambiguity at issue. But if Congress has exempted particu-\nlar provisions from that authority, that exemption must be\nrespected, and the determination whether Congress has\ndone so is for the courts alone.\n   The FCC\u2019s argument that Congress \u201ccan ordinarily be\nexpected to state that intent explicitly,\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondents 30 (citing American Hospital, supra), goes to\nthe merits of that determination, not to whether a court\nshould decide the question de novo or defer to the agency.\nIndeed, that is how the Court in American Hospital con-\nsidered it. It was in the process of \u201cemploying the tradi-\ntional tools of statutory construction\u201d that the Court said\nit would have expected Congress to speak more clearly if it\n14                  ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nhad intended to exclude an entire subject area\u2014employee\nunits for collecting bargaining\u2014from the NLRB\u2019s general\nrulemaking authority. Id., at 613, 614. The Court con-\ncluded, after considering the language, structure, policy,\nand legislative history of the Act on its own\u2014without\ndeferring to the agency\u2014that the meaning of the statute\nwas \u201cclear and contrary to the meaning advanced by peti-\ntioner.\u201d Id., at 609\u2013614. To be sure, the Court also noted\nthat \u201c[e]ven if we could find any ambiguity in [the provi-\nsion] after employing the traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction, we would still defer to Board\u2019s reasonable\ninterpretation.\u201d Id., at 614 (emphasis added). But that\nsingle sentence of dictum cannot carry the day for the FCC\nhere.\n                             V\n  As the preceding analysis makes clear, I do not under-\nstand petitioners to ask the Court\u2014nor do I think it\nnecessary\u2014to draw a \u201cspecious, but scary-sounding\u201d line\nbetween \u201cbig, important\u201d interpretations on the one hand\nand \u201chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\u201d ones on the other. Ante,\nat 5, 12. Drawing such a line may well be difficult. Dis-\ntinguishing between whether an agency\u2019s interpretation of\nan ambiguous term is reasonable and whether that term is\nfor the agency to interpret is not nearly so difficult. It\ncertainly did not confuse the FCC in this proceeding.\nCompare In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC\nRcd. 13994, 14000\u201314003 (2009) (addressing the latter\nquestion), with id., at 14003\u201314015 (addressing the for-\nmer). Nor did it confound the Fifth Circuit. Compare 668\nF. 3d, at 247\u2013254 (deciding \u201cwhether the FCC possessed\nstatutory authority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u201d), with\nid., at 254\u2013260 (considering \u201cwhether the 90- and 150-day\ntime frames themselves also pass muster under Chevron\u201d).\nMore importantly, if the legitimacy of Chevron deference is\nbased on a congressional delegation of interpretive author-\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

J., dissenting\n\nity, then the line is one the Court must draw.\n   The majority\u2019s hypothetical Common Carrier Acts do not\ndemonstrate anything different. Ante, at 6\u20138. The major-\nity states that in its second Common Carrier Act, Section 2\nmakes clear that Congress \u201c \u2018conferred interpretative\npower on the agency\u2019 \u201d to interpret the ambiguous terms\n\u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condition.\u201d Ante,\nat 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p. 14).\nThus, it says, under anyone\u2019s theory a court must defer to\nthe agency\u2019s reasonable interpretations of those terms.\nCorrect.\n   The majority claims, however, that \u201cpetitioners\u2019 theory\nwould accord the agency no deference\u201d in its interpretation\nof the same ambiguous terms in the first Common Carrier\nAct. Ante, at 7\u20138. But as I understand petitioners\u2019\nargument\u2014and certainly in my own view\u2014a court, in both\ncases, need only decide for itself whether Congress has\ndelegated to the agency authority to interpret the ambigu-\nous terms, before affording the agency\u2019s interpretation\nChevron deference.\n   For the second Common Carrier Act, the answer is easy.\nThe majority\u2019s hypothetical Congress has spoken clearly\nand specifically in Section 2 of the Act about its delegation\nof authority to interpret Section 1. As for the first Act, it\nis harder to analyze the question, given only one section of\na presumably much larger statute. But if the first Com-\nmon Carrier Act is like most agencies\u2019 organic statutes, I\nhave no reason to doubt that the agency would likewise\nhave interpretive authority over the same ambiguous\nterms, and therefore be entitled to deference in con-\nstruing them, just as with the second Common Carrier\nAct. There is no new \u201ctest\u201d to worry about, cf. ante, at 16;\ncourts would simply apply the normal rules of statutory\nconstruction.\n   That the question might be harder with respect to the\nfirst Common Carrier Act should come as no surprise. The\n16                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsecond hypothetical Congress has more carefully defined\nthe agency\u2019s authority than the first. Whatever standard\nof review applies, it is more difficult to interpret an un-\nclear statute than a clear one. My point is simply that\nbefore a court can defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of\nthe ambiguous terms in either Act, it must determine for\nitself that Congress has delegated authority to the agency\nto issue those interpretations with the force of law.\n   The majority also expresses concern that adopting peti-\ntioners\u2019 position would undermine Chevron\u2019s stable back-\nground rule against which Congress legislates. Ante, at 5.\nThat, of course, begs the question of what that stable\nbackground rule is. See Merrill & Hickman, Chevron\u2019s\nDomain, 89 Geo. L. Rev. 833, 910 (2001) (\u201cCourts have\nnever deferred to agencies with respect to questions such\nas whether Congress has delegated to an agency the power\nto act with the force of law through either legislative rules\nor binding adjudications. Similarly, it has never been\nmaintained that Congress would want courts to give Chev-\nron deference to an agency\u2019s determination that it is\nentitled to Chevron deference, or should give Chevron\ndeference to an agency\u2019s determination of what types of\ninterpretations are entitled to Chevron deference\u201d (foot-\nnote omitted)).\n                             VI\n   The Court sees something nefarious behind the view\nthat courts must decide on their own whether Congress\nhas delegated interpretative authority to an agency, before\ndeferring to that agency\u2019s interpretation of law. What is\nafoot, according to the Court, is a judicial power-grab, with\nnothing less than \u201cChevron itself \u201d as \u201cthe ultimate target.\u201d\nAnte, at 12.\n   The Court touches on a legitimate concern: Chevron\nimportantly guards against the Judiciary arrogating to\nitself policymaking properly left, under the separation of\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

But there is another concern at\nplay, no less firmly rooted in our constitutional structure.\nThat is the obligation of the Judiciary not only to confine\nitself to its proper role, but to ensure that the other\nbranches do so as well.\n   An agency\u2019s interpretive authority, entitling the agency\nto judicial deference, acquires its legitimacy from a delega-\ntion of lawmaking power from Congress to the Executive.\nOur duty to police the boundary between the Legislature\nand the Executive is as critical as our duty to respect that\nbetween the Judiciary and the Executive. See Zivotofsky\nv. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8). In the\npresent context, that means ensuring that the Legislative\nBranch has in fact delegated lawmaking power to an\nagency within the Executive Branch, before the Judiciary\ndefers to the Executive on what the law is. That concern\nis heightened, not diminished, by the fact that the admin-\nistrative agencies, as a practical matter, draw upon a\npotent brew of executive, legislative, and judicial power.\nAnd it is heightened, not diminished, by the dramatic\nshift in power over the last 50 years from Congress to the\nExecutive\u2014a shift effected through the administrative\nagencies.\n   We reconcile our competing responsibilities in this area\nby ensuring judicial deference to agency interpretations\nunder Chevron\u2014but only after we have determined on our\nown that Congress has given interpretive authority to the\nagency. Our \u201ctask is to fix the boundaries of delegated\nauthority,\u201d Monaghan, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 27; that is\nnot a task we can delegate to the agency.

Argued January 16, 2013\u2014Decided May 20, 2013*\nThe Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires state or local\n  governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities \u201cwith-\n  in a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.\u201d 47\n  U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). Relying on its broad authority to implement\n  the Communications Act, see 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b), the Federal Com-\n  munications Commission (FCC) issued a Declaratory Ruling conclud-\n  ing that the phrase \u201creasonable period of time\u201d is presumptively (but\n  rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna\n  on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications.\n  The cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, sought review of the\n  Declaratory Ruling in the Fifth Circuit. They argued that the Com-\n  mission lacked authority to interpret \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)\u2019s limitations. The\n  Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent holding that Chevron\n  U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S.\n  837, applies to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own statutory juris-\n  diction, applied Chevron to that question. Finding the statute am-\n  biguous, it upheld as a permissible construction of the statute the\n  FCC\u2019s view that \u00a7201(b)\u2019s broad grant of regulatory authority em-\n  powered it to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B).\nHeld: Courts must apply the Chevron framework to an agency\u2019s inter-\n pretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the\n agency\u2019s statutory authority (i.e., its jurisdiction).

FCC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) Under Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask whether Con-\n    gress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if so, the\n    court must give effect to Congress\u2019 unambiguously expressed intent.\n    467 U. S., at 842\u2013843. However, if \u201cthe statute is silent or ambigu-\n    ous,\u201d the court must defer to the administering agency\u2019s construction\n    of the statute so long as it is permissible. Id., at 843. Pp. 4\u20135.\n       (b) When a court reviews an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it\n    administers, the question is always, simply, whether the agency has\n    stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority. There is no dis-\n    tinction between an agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d\n    interpretations. The \u201cjurisdictional-nonjurisdictional\u201d line is mean-\n    ingful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell\n    the courts what classes of cases they may decide\u2014that is, to define\n    their jurisdiction\u2014but not to prescribe how they decide those cases.\n    But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes,\n    both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively pre-\n    scribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than\n    when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.\n    Because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond\n    what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for\n    carving out an arbitrary subset of \u201cjurisdictional\u201d questions from the\n    Chevron framework. See, e.g., National Cable & Telecommunications\n    Assn., Inc. v. Gulf Power Co., 534 U. S. 327, 333, 339. Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (c) This Court has consistently afforded Chevron deference to agen-\n    cies\u2019 constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\n    Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833;\n    United States v. Eurodif S. A., 555 U. S. 305, 316. Chevron applies to\n    statutes designed to curtail the scope of agency discretion, see Chem-\n    ical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 470 U. S.\n    116, 123, and even where concerns about agency self-aggrandizement\n    are at their apogee\u2014i.e., where an agency\u2019s expansive construction of\n    the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental\n    change in the regulatory scheme, see FDA v. Brown & Williamson\n    Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 132. Pp. 10\u201314.\n       (d) The contention that Chevron deference is not appropriate here\n    because the FCC asserted jurisdiction over matters of traditional\n    state and local concern is meritless. These cases have nothing to do\n    with federalism: The statute explicitly supplants state authority, so\n    the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will\n    draw the lines to which the States must hew. P. 14.\n       (e) United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, requires that, for\n    Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congres-\n    sional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the\n    particular manner adopted.

A general conferral of rulemaking authority vali-\n  dates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administer-\n  ing.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).\n                           I\n  Wireless telecommunications networks require towers\nand antennas; proposed sites for those towers and anten-\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnas must be approved by local zoning authorities. In the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \u201cimpose[d]\nspecific limitations on the traditional authority of state\nand local governments to regulate the location, construc-\ntion, and modification of such facilities,\u201d Rancho Palos\nVerdes v. Abrams, 544 U. S. 113, 115 (2005), and incorpo-\nrated those limitations into the Communications Act of\n1934, see 110 Stat. 56, 151. Section 201(b) of that Act\nempowers the Federal Communications Commission to\n\u201cprescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary\nin the public interest to carry out [its] provisions.\u201d Ch.\n296, 52 Stat. 588, codified at 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b). Of\ncourse, that rulemaking authority extends to the subse-\nquently added portions of the Act. See AT&T Corp. v.\nIowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 377\u2013378 (1999).\n   The Act imposes five substantive limitations, which are\ncodified in 47 U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B); only one of them,\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), is at issue here. That provision requires\nstate or local governments to act on wireless siting appli-\ncations \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time after the re-\nquest is duly filed.\u201d Two other features of \u00a7332(c)(7) are\nrelevant. First, subparagraph (A), known as the \u201csaving\nclause,\u201d provides that nothing in the Act, except those\nlimitations provided in \u00a7332(c)(7)(B), \u201cshall limit or affect\nthe authority of a State or local government\u201d over siting\ndecisions. Second, \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(v) authorizes a person\nwho believes a state or local government\u2019s wireless-siting\ndecision to be inconsistent with any of the limitations in\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B) to \u201ccommence an action in any court of com-\npetent jurisdiction.\u201d\n   In theory, \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires state and local\nzoning authorities to take prompt action on siting applica-\ntions for wireless facilities. But in practice, wireless pro-\nviders often faced long delays. In July 2008, CTIA\u2014The\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

In re Petition for Declaratory Rul-\ning, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994, 14001. The Commission found\nthat the \u201crecord evidence demonstrates that unreasonable\ndelays in the personal wireless service facility siting\nprocess have obstructed the provision of wireless services\u201d\nand that such delays \u201cimpede the promotion of ad-\nvanced services and competition that Congress deemed\ncritical in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\u201d Id., at\n14006, 14008.       A \u201creasonable period of time\u201d under\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), the Commission determined, is presump-\ntively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process a collocation\napplication (that is, an application to place a new antenna\non an existing tower) and 150 days to process all other\napplications. Id., at 14005.\n   Some state and local governments opposed adoption of\nthe Declaratory Ruling on the ground that the Commis-\nsion lacked \u201cauthority to interpret ambiguous provisions of\nSection 332(c)(7).\u201d Id., at 14000. Specifically, they argued\nthat the saving clause, \u00a7332(c)(7)(A), and the judicial\nreview provision, \u00a7337(c)(7)(B)(v), together display a con-\ngressional intent to withhold from the Commission author-\nity to interpret the limitations in \u00a7332(c)(7)(B). Asserting\nthat ground of objection, the cities of Arlington and San\nAntonio, Texas, petitioned for review of the Declaratory\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 This is not a typographical error.

FCC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nRuling in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n   Relying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals held\nthat the Chevron framework applied to the threshold\nquestion whether the FCC possessed statutory authority\nto adopt the 90- and 150-day timeframes. 668 F. 3d 229,\n248 (CA5 2012) (citing Texas v. United States, 497 F. 3d\n491, 501 (CA5 2007)). Applying Chevron, the Court of\nAppeals found \u201c\u00a7332(c)(7)(A)\u2019s effect on the FCC\u2019s author-\nity to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)\u2019s limitations ambiguous,\u201d\n668 F. 3d, at 250, and held that \u201cthe FCC\u2019s interpretation\nof its statutory authority\u201d was a permissible construction\nof the statute. Id., at 254. On the merits, the court upheld\nthe presumptive 90- and 150-day deadlines as a \u201cpermis-\nsible construction of \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) . . . entitled to\nChevron deference.\u201d Id., at 256.\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U.

S., at 842. First,\napplying the ordinary tools of statutory construction, the\ncourt must determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of\nCongress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the\ncourt, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unam-\nbiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d Id., at 842\u2013843.\nBut \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to\nthe specific issue, the question for the court is whether the\nagency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe statute.\u201d Id., at 843.\n  Chevron is rooted in a background presumption of con-\ngressional intent: namely, \u201cthat Congress, when it left\nambiguity in a statute\u201d administered by an agency, \u201cun-\nderstood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and\nforemost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather\nthan the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion\nthe ambiguity allows.\u201d Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota),\nN. A., 517 U. S. 735, 740\u2013741 (1996). Chevron thus pro-\nvides a stable background rule against which Congress\ncan legislate: Statutory ambiguities will be resolved,\nwithin the bounds of reasonable interpretation, not by the\ncourts but by the administering agency. See Iowa Utilities\nBd., 525 U. S., at 397. Congress knows to speak in plain\nterms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capacious\nterms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.\n                               B\n   The question here is whether a court must defer under\nChevron to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory ambi-\nguity that concerns the scope of the agency\u2019s statutory\nauthority (that is, its jurisdiction). The argument against\ndeference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct\nclasses of agency interpretations: Some interpretations\u2014\nthe big, important ones, presumably\u2014define the agency\u2019s\n\u201cjurisdiction.\u201d Others\u2014humdrum, run-of-the-mill stuff\u2014\nare simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly\nhas. That premise is false, because the distinction be-\ntween \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d interpreta-\ntions is a mirage. No matter how it is framed, the question\na court faces when confronted with an agency\u2019s inter-\npretation of a statute it administers is always, simply,\nwhether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its\nstatutory authority.\n   The misconception that there are, for Chevron purposes,\nseparate \u201cjurisdictional\u201d questions on which no deference\n6                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nis due derives, perhaps, from a reflexive extension to agen-\ncies of the very real division between the jurisdictional\nand nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts. In the\njudicial context, there is a meaningful line: Whether the\ncourt decided correctly is a question that has different\nconsequences from the question whether it had the power\nto decide at all. Congress has the power (within limits) to\ntell the courts what classes of cases they may decide, see\nTrainmen v. Toledo, P. & W. R. Co., 321 U. S. 50, 63\u201364\n(1944); Lauf v. E. G. Shinner & Co., 303 U. S. 323, 330\n(1938), but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide\nthose cases, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U. S.\n211, 218\u2013219 (1995). A court\u2019s power to decide a case is\nindependent of whether its decision is correct, which is\nwhy even an erroneous judgment is entitled to res judicata\neffect. Put differently, a jurisdictionally proper but sub-\nstantively incorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.\n   That is not so for agencies charged with administering\ncongressional statutes. Both their power to act and how\nthey are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress,\nso that when they act improperly, no less than when they\nact beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.\nBecause the question\u2014whether framed as an incorrect\napplication of agency authority or an assertion of author-\nity not conferred\u2014is always whether the agency has gone\nbeyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no\nprincipled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of\nsuch claims as \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d\n   An example will illustrate just how illusory the pro-\nposed line between \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d\nagency interpretations is. Imagine the following validly-\nenacted statute:\n    COMMON CARRIER ACT\n    SECTION 1. The Agency shall have jurisdiction to pro-\n    hibit any common carrier from imposing an unreason-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n    able condition upon access to its facilities.\nThere is no question that this provision\u2014including the\nterms \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condition\u201d\u2014\ndefines the Agency\u2019s jurisdiction. Surely, the argument\ngoes, a court must determine de novo the scope of that\njurisdiction.\n  Consider, however, this alternative formulation of the\nstatute:\n    COMMON CARRIER ACT\n    SECTION 1. No common carrier shall impose an un-\n    reasonable condition upon access to its facilities.\n    SECTION 2. The Agency may prescribe rules and regu-\n    lations necessary in the public interest to effectuate\n    Section 1 of this Act.\nNow imagine that the Agency, invoking its Section 2\nauthority, promulgates this Rule: \u201c(1) The term \u2018common\ncarrier\u2019 in Section 1 includes Internet Service Providers.\n(2) The term \u2018unreasonable condition\u2019 in Section 1 includes\nunreasonably high prices. (3) A monthly fee greater than\n$25 is an unreasonable condition on access to Internet\nservice.\u201d By this Rule, the Agency has claimed for itself\njurisdiction that is doubly questionable: Does its authority\nextend to Internet Service Providers? And does it extend\nto setting prices? Yet Section 2 makes clear that Con-\ngress, in petitioners\u2019 words, \u201cconferred interpretive power\non the agency\u201d with respect to Section 1. Brief for Peti-\ntioners in No. 1545, p. 14. Even under petitioners\u2019 theory,\nthen, a court should defer to the Agency\u2019s interpretation of\nthe terms \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condi-\ntion\u201d\u2014that is to say, its assertion that its \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\nextends to regulating Internet Service Providers and\nsetting prices.\n   In the first case, by contrast, petitioners\u2019 theory would\naccord the agency no deference. The trouble with this is\nthat in both cases, the underlying question is exactly the\n8                         ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsame: Does the statute give the agency authority to regu-\nlate Internet Service Providers and cap prices, or not?2\nThe reality, laid bare, is that there is no difference, insofar\nas the validity of agency action is concerned, between an\nagency\u2019s exceeding the scope of its authority (its \u201cjurisdic-\ntion\u201d) and its exceeding authorized application of authority\nthat it unquestionably has. \u201cTo exceed authorized applica-\ntion is to exceed authority. Virtually any administrative\naction can be characterized as either the one or the other,\ndepending on how generally one wishes to describe the\n\u2018authority.\u2019 \u201d Mississippi Power & Light Co. v.

Rev. 1, 29 (1983)\n(\u201cAdministrative application of law is administrative\nformulation of law whenever it involves elaboration of the\nstatutory norm.\u201d).\n   This point is nicely illustrated by our decision in Na-\ntional Cable & Telecommunications Assn., Inc. v. Gulf\nPower Co., 534 U. S. 327 (2002). That case considered\nwhether the FCC\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to regulate the rents\nutility-pole owners charge for \u201cpole attachments\u201d (defined\nas attachments by a cable television system or provider of\ntelecommunications service) extended to attachments that\nprovided both cable television and high-speed Internet\naccess (attachments for so-called \u201ccommingled services\u201d).\nId., at 331\u2013336.

The two statutes are substantively\nidentical. Any difference in outcome would be arbitrary, so a sound\ninterpretive approach should yield none.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

One of\nthe briefs in support of petitioners explains, helpfully, that\n\u201c[j]urisdictional questions concern the who, what, where,\nand when of regulatory power: which subject matters may\nan agency regulate and under what conditions.\u201d Brief for\nIMLA Respondents 18\u201319. But an agency\u2019s application of\nits authority pursuant to statutory text answers the same\nquestions. Who is an \u201coutside salesman\u201d? What is a \u201cpole\nattachment\u201d? Where do the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d\nend? When must a Medicare provider challenge a reim-\nbursement determination in order to be entitled to an\nadministrative appeal? These can all be reframed as ques-\ntions about the scope of agencies\u2019 regulatory jurisdiction\u2014\nand they are all questions to which the Chevron\nframework applies. See Christopher v.

See H. Edwards & L. Elliott,\n10                    ARLINGTON v.

Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a73.5, p.\n187 (2010). One of our opinions explicitly says that no\n\u201cexception exists to the normal [deferential] standard of\nreview\u201d for \u201c \u2018jurisdictional or legal question[s] concerning\nthe coverage\u2019 \u201d of an Act. NLRB v. City Disposal Systems,\nInc., 465 U. S. 822, 830, n. 7 (1984). A prime example of\ndeferential review for questions of jurisdiction is Commod-\nity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833\n(1986). That case involved a CFTC interpretation of 7\nU. S.

The CFTC,\npursuant to its broad rulemaking authority, see \u00a712a(5),\ninterpreted that oblique reference to counterclaims as\ngranting it \u201cthe power to take jurisdiction over\u201d not just\nfederal-law counterclaims, but state-law counterclaims as\nwell.

Barrett, 494\nU. S. 638 (1990), see post, at 8\u20139, is misplaced. In that case, the De-\npartment of Labor had interpreted a statute creating a private right of\naction for migrant or seasonal farmworkers as providing no remedy\nwhere a state workers\u2019-compensation law covered the worker. 494\nU. S., at 649. We held that we had no need to \u201cdefer to the Secretary of\nLabor\u2019s view of the scope of\u201d that private right of action \u201cbecause\nCongress has expressly established the Judiciary and not the Depart-\nment of Labor as the adjudicator of private rights of action arising\nunder the statute.\u201d Ibid. Adams Fruit stands for the modest proposi-\ntion that the Judiciary, not any executive agency, determines \u201cthe\nscope\u201d\u2014including the available remedies\u2014\u201cof judicial power vested by\u201d\nstatutes establishing private rights of action. Id., at 650. Adams Fruit\nexplicitly affirmed the Department\u2019s authority to promulgate the\nsubstantive standards enforced through that private right of action.\nSee ibid.\n   The dissent\u2019s invocation of Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006),\nsee post, at 10\u201311, is simply perplexing: The majority opinion in that\n12                      ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our cases hold that Chevron applies equally to statutes\ndesigned to curtail the scope of agency discretion. For\ninstance, in Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v. Natural Resources\nDefense Council, Inc., 470 U. S. 116, 123 (1985), we con-\nsidered a statute prohibiting the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency from \u201cmodify[ing] any requirement of this\nsection as it applies to any specific pollutant which is on\nthe toxic pollutant list.\u201d The EPA construed the statute as\nnot precluding it from granting variances with respect to\ncertain toxic pollutants. Finding no \u201cclear congressional\nintent to forbid EPA\u2019s sensible variance mechanism,\u201d id.,\nat 134, we deferred to the EPA\u2019s construction of this ex-\npress limitation on its own regulatory authority, id., at\n125 (citing Chevron, 467 U. S. 837); see also, e.g., Japan\nWhaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478 U. S. 221,\n226, 232\u2013234 (1986).\n   The U. S. Reports are shot through with applications of\nChevron to agencies\u2019 constructions of the scope of their\nown jurisdiction. And we have applied Chevron where\nconcerns about agency self-aggrandizement are at their\napogee: in cases where an agency\u2019s expansive construction\nof the extent of its own power would have wrought a fun-\ndamental change in the regulatory scheme. In FDA v.\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120 (2000),\nthe threshold question was the \u201cappropriate framework for\nanalyzing\u201d the FDA\u2019s assertion of \u201cjurisdiction to regulate\ntobacco products,\u201d id., at 126, 132\u2014a question of vast\n\u201ceconomic and political magnitude,\u201d id., at 133. \u201cBecause\nthis case involves an administrative agency\u2019s construction\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ncase expressly lists the Communications Act as an example of a statute\nunder which an agency\u2019s \u201cauthority is clear because the statute gives\nan agency broad power to enforce all provisions of the statute.\u201d 546\nU. S., at 258\u2013259 (citing 47 U. S. C. \u00a7201(b); emphasis added). That\nstatement cannot be squared with the dissent\u2019s proposed remand for\nthe Fifth Circuit to determine \u201cwhether Congress delegated interpre-\ntive authority over \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) to the FCC.\u201d Post, at 18.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Similarly, in MCI Telecommunications\nCorp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U. S.\n218, 224, 229, 231 (1994), we applied the Chevron frame-\nwork to the FCC\u2019s assertion that the statutory phrase\n\u201cmodify any requirement\u201d gave it authority to eliminate\nrate-filing requirements, \u201cthe essential characteristic of a\nrate-regulated industry,\u201d for long-distance telephone\ncarriers.\n   The false dichotomy between \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnon-\njurisdictional\u201d agency interpretations may be no more\nthan a bogeyman, but it is dangerous all the same. Like\nthe Hound of the Baskervilles, it is conjured by those with\ngreater quarry in sight: Make no mistake\u2014the ultimate\ntarget here is Chevron itself. Savvy challengers of agency\naction would play the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d card in every case.\nSee, e.g., Cellco Partnership v. FCC, 700 F. 3d 534,\n541 (CADC 2012). Some judges would be deceived by\nthe specious, but scary-sounding, \u201cjurisdictional\u201d-\n\u201cnonjurisdictional\u201d line; others tempted by the prospect of\nmaking public policy by prescribing the meaning of am-\nbiguous statutory commands. The effect would be to\ntransfer any number of interpretive decisions\u2014archetypal\nChevron questions, about how best to construe an ambigu-\nous term in light of competing policy interests\u2014from the\nagencies that administer the statutes to federal courts.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2019s discomfort with the growth of agency power,\nsee post, at 2\u20134, is perhaps understandable. But the dissent overstates\nwhen it claims that agencies exercise \u201clegislative power\u201d and \u201cjudicial\npower.\u201d Post, at 2; see also post, at 16. The former is vested exclusively\nin Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a71, the latter in the \u201cone supreme\nCourt\u201d and \u201csuch inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time\nordain and establish,\u201d Art. III, \u00a71. Agencies make rules (\u201cPrivate cattle\nmay be grazed on public lands X, Y, and Z subject to certain condi-\ntions\u201d) and conduct adjudications (\u201cThis rancher\u2019s grazing permit is\nrevoked for violation of the conditions\u201d) and have done so since the\nbeginning of the Republic. These activities take \u201clegislative\u201d and\n14                       ARLINGTON v.

Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U. S.\n555, 568 (1980). That is precisely what Chevron prevents.\n                             III\n                              A\n  One group of respondents contends that Chevron defer-\nence is inappropriate here because the FCC has \u201cas-\nsert[ed] jurisdiction over matters of traditional state and\nlocal concern.\u201d Brief for IMLA Respondents 35. But this\ncase has nothing to do with federalism.             Section\n332(c)(7)(B)(ii) explicitly supplants state authority by\nrequiring zoning authorities to render a decision \u201cwithin a\nreasonable period of time,\u201d and the meaning of that phrase\nis indisputably a question of federal law. We rejected a\nsimilar faux-federalism argument in the Iowa Utilities\nBoard case, in terms that apply equally here: \u201cThis is, at\nbottom, a debate not about whether the States will be\nallowed to do their own thing, but about whether it will be\nthe FCC or the federal courts that draw the lines to which\nthey must hew.\u201d 525 U.

Mead Corp.,\n533 U. S. 218 (2001), requires that, for Chevron deference\nto apply, the agency must have received congressional\nauthority to determine the particular matter at issue in\nthe particular manner adopted. No one disputes that.\nBut Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency\nwith rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking.\nWhat the dissent needs, and fails to produce, is a single\ncase in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudi-\ncative authority has been held insufficient to support\nChevron deference for an exercise of that authority within\nthe agency\u2019s substantive field. There is no such case, and\nwhat the dissent proposes is a massive revision of our\nChevron jurisprudence.\n  Where we differ from the dissent is in its apparent\nrejection of the theorem that the whole includes all of its\nparts\u2014its view that a general conferral of rulemaking\nauthority does not validate rules for all the matters the\nagency is charged with administering. Rather, the dissent\nproposes that even when general rulemaking authority is\nclear, every agency rule must be subjected to a de novo\njudicial determination of whether the particular issue was\ncommitted to agency discretion. It offers no standards at\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n\u201cmisunderstand[ing]\u201d the question presented as one of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d \n\nPost, at 5.

FCC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nall to guide this open-ended hunt for congressional intent\n(that is to say, for evidence of congressional intent more\nspecific than the conferral of general rulemaking author-\nity). It would simply punt that question back to the Court\nof Appeals, presumably for application of some sort of\ntotality-of-the-circumstances test\u2014which is really, of\ncourse, not a test at all but an invitation to make an\nad hoc judgment regarding congressional intent. Thirteen\nCourts of Appeals applying a totality-of-the-circumstances\ntest would render the binding effect of agency rules un-\npredictable and destroy the whole stabilizing purpose of\nChevron. The excessive agency power that the dissent\nfears would be replaced by chaos. There is no need to\nwade into these murky waters. It suffices to decide this\ncase that the preconditions to deference under Chevron\nare satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested\nthe FCC with general authority to administer the Com-\nmunications Act through rulemaking and adjudication,\nand the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.\n                         *    *    *\n     Those who assert that applying Chevron to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional\u201d interpretations \u201cleaves the fox in charge of the\nhenhouse\u201d overlook the reality that a separate category of\n\u201cjurisdictional\u201d interpretations does not exist. The fox-in-\nthe-henhouse syndrome is to be avoided not by estab-\nlishing an arbitrary and undefinable category of agency\ndecisionmaking that is accorded no deference, but by taking\nseriously, and applying rigorously, in all cases, statutory\nlimits on agencies\u2019 authority. Where Congress has estab-\nlished a clear line, the agency cannot go beyond it; and\nwhere Congress has established an ambiguous line, the\nagency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly\nallow.

In this context, \u201cthe distinction\nbetween \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 and \u2018non-jurisdictional\u2019 interpreta-\ntions is a mirage.\u201d Ante, at 5.\n   Deciding just what those statutory bounds are, however,\nis not always an easy matter, and the Court\u2019s case law\nabounds with discussion of the subject. A reviewing judge,\nfor example, will have to decide independently whether\nCongress delegated authority to the agency to provide\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\ninterpretations of, or to enact rules pursuant to, the stat-\nute at issue\u2014interpretations or rules that carry with them\n\u201cthe force of law.\u201d United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S.\n218, 229 (2001). If so, the reviewing court must give spe-\ncial leeway or \u201cdeference\u201d to the agency\u2019s interpretation.\nSee id., at 227\u2013228.\n  We have added that, if \u201c[e]mploying traditional tools of\nstatutory construction,\u201d INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U. S.\n421, 446 (1987), the court determines that Congress has\nspoken clearly on the disputed question, then \u201cthat is the\nend of the matter,\u201d Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984).\nThe agency is due no deference, for Congress has left no\ngap for the agency to fill. Id., at 842\u2013844. If, on the other\nhand, Congress has not spoken clearly, if, for example it\nhas written ambiguously, then that ambiguity is a sign\u2014\nbut not always a conclusive sign\u2014that Congress intends a\nreviewing court to pay particular attention to (i.e., to give\na degree of deference to) the agency\u2019s interpretation. See\nGonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243, 258\u2013269 (2006); Mead,\nsupra, at 229.\n  I say that the existence of statutory ambiguity is some-\ntimes not enough to warrant the conclusion that Congress\nhas left a deference-warranting gap for the agency to fill be-\ncause our cases make clear that other, sometimes context-\nspecific, factors will on occasion prove relevant. (And,\ngiven the vast number of government statutes, regulatory\nprograms, and underlying circumstances, that variety is\nhardly surprising.) In Mead, for example, we looked to\nseveral factors other than simple ambiguity to help deter-\nmine whether Congress left a statutory gap, thus delegat-\ning to the agency the authority to fill that gap with an\ninterpretation that would carry \u201cthe force of law.\u201d 533\nU.

Walton, 535 U. S. 212,\n    222 (2002).\nThe subject matter of the relevant provision\u2014for instance,\nits distance from the agency\u2019s ordinary statutory duties or\nits falling within the scope of another agency\u2019s authority\u2014\nhas also proved relevant.

Rev. 989, 1007\u20131010\n(1999).\n   Moreover, the statute\u2019s text, its context, the structure of\nthe statutory scheme, and canons of textual construction\nare relevant in determining whether the statute is ambig-\nuous and can be equally helpful in determining whether\nsuch ambiguity comes accompanied with agency authority\nto fill a gap with an interpretation that carries the force of\nlaw. See Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541\nU. S. 232, 239\u2013242 (2004); Zuni Public School Dist. No. 89\nv. Department of Education, 550 U. S. 81, 98\u201399 (2007);\nFDA v.

FCC\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\napproximate how Congress would likely have meant to\nallocate interpretive law-determining authority between\nreviewing court and agency. The question whether Con-\ngress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide\nan interpretation that carries the force of law is for the\njudge to answer independently. The judge, considering\n\u201ctraditional tools of statutory construction,\u201d Cardoza-\nFonseca, supra, at 446, will ask whether Congress has\nspoken unambiguously. If so, the text controls. If not, the\njudge will ask whether Congress would have intended the\nagency to resolve the resulting ambiguity. If so, deference\nis warranted. See Mead, supra, at 229. Even if not, how-\never, sometimes an agency interpretation, in light of the\nagency\u2019s special expertise, will still have the \u201cpower to\npersuade, if lacking power to control,\u201d Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944).\n   The case before us offers an example. The relevant\nstatutory provision requires state or local governments to\nact on wireless siting applications \u201cwithin a reasonable\nperiod of time after\u201d a wireless service provider files such\na request. 47 U. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC) argued that this pro-\nvision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the\namount of time that is reasonable. Many factors favor the\nagency\u2019s view: (1) the language of the Telecommunications\nAct grants the FCC broad authority (including rulemaking\nauthority) to administer the Act; (2) the words are open-\nended\u2014i.e. \u201cambiguous\u201d; (3) the provision concerns an\ninterstitial administrative matter, in respect to which the\nagency\u2019s expertise could have an important role to play;\nand (4) the matter, in context, is complex, likely making\nthe agency\u2019s expertise useful in helping to answer the \u201crea-\nsonableness\u201d question that the statute poses. See \u00a7151\n(creating the FCC); \u00a7201(b) (providing rulemaking auth-\nority); National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v.\nBrand X Internet Services, 545 U.

S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\n(acknowledging the FCC\u2019s authority to administer the\nAct).\n   On the other side of the coin, petitioners point to two\nstatutory provisions which, they believe, require a differ-\nent conclusion\u2014namely, that the FCC lacked authority\naltogether to interpret \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). First, a nearby\nsaving clause says: \u201cExcept as provided in this paragraph,\nnothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority\nof a State or local government or instrumentality thereof\nover decisions regarding the placement, construction, and\nmodification of personal wireless service facilities.\u201d\n\u00a7332(c)(7)(A). Second, a judicial review provision, says:\n\u201cAny person adversely affected by any final action or\nfailure to act by a State or local government or any in-\nstrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this sub-\nparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure\nto act, commence an action in any court of competent\njurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n   In my view, however, these two provisions cannot pro-\nvide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by\npetitioners. The first provision begins with an exception,\nstating that it does not apply to (among other things) the\n\u201creasonableness\u201d provision here at issue. The second sim-\nply sets forth a procedure for judicial review, a review\nthat applies to most government actions. Both are con-\nsistent with a statutory scheme that gives States, locali-\nties, the FCC, and reviewing courts each some role to play\nin the location of wireless service facilities. And neither\n\u201cexpressly describ[es] an exception\u201d to the FCC\u2019s plenary\nauthority to interpret the Act. American Hospital Assn. v.\nNLRB, 499 U. S. 606, 613 (1991).\n   For these reasons, I would reject petitioners\u2019 argument\nand conclude that \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u2014the \u201creasonableness\u201d\nstatute\u2014leaves a gap for the FCC to fill. I would hold that\nthe FCC\u2019s lawful efforts to do so carry \u201cthe force of law.\u201d\nMead, 533 U. S., at 229. The Court of Appeals ultimately\n6                   ARLINGTON v.

It is\nalso easily expressed: A court should not defer to an agency\nuntil the court decides, on its own, that the agency is\nentitled to deference. Courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpre-\ntation of law when and because Congress has conferred on\nthe agency interpretive authority over the question at\nissue. An agency cannot exercise interpretive authority\nuntil it has it; the question whether an agency enjoys that\nauthority must be decided by a court, without deference to\nthe agency.\n2                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                               I\n\n   One of the principal authors of the Constitution famously\nwrote that the \u201caccumulation of all powers, legislative,\nexecutive, and judiciary, in the same hands, . . . may justly\nbe pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d The Feder-\nalist No. 47, p. 324 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).\nAlthough modern administrative agencies fit most com-\nfortably within the Executive Branch, as a practical matter\nthey exercise legislative power, by promulgating regula-\ntions with the force of law; executive power, by policing\ncompliance with those regulations; and judicial power, by\nadjudicating enforcement actions and imposing sanctions\non those found to have violated their rules. The accumula-\ntion of these powers in the same hands is not an occasional\nor isolated exception to the constitutional plan; it is a\ncentral feature of modern American government.\n   The administrative state \u201cwields vast power and touches\nalmost every aspect of daily life.\u201d Free Enterprise Fund v.\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 18). The Framers could hardly have\nenvisioned today\u2019s \u201cvast and varied federal bureaucracy\u201d\nand the authority administrative agencies now hold over\nour economic, social, and political activities. Ibid. \u201c[T]he\nadministrative state with its reams of regulations would\nleave them rubbing their eyes.\u201d Alden v. Maine, 527 U.

And the federal bureaucracy con-\ntinues to grow; in the last 15 years, Congress has launched\nmore than 50 new agencies. Compare Office of the Federal\nRegister, United States Government Manual 1997/1998,\nwith Office of the Federal Register, United States Gov-\nernment Manual 2012. And more are on the way.

As\nscholars have noted, \u201cno President (or his executive office\nstaff) could, and presumably none would wish to, super-\nvise so broad a swath of regulatory activity.\u201d Kagan,\nPresidential Administration, 114 Harv.

President Truman\ncolorfully described his power over the administrative\nstate by complaining, \u201cI thought I was the president, but\nwhen it comes to these bureaucrats, I can\u2019t do a damn\nthing.\u201d See R. Nathan, The Administrative Presidency 2\n(1986). President Kennedy once told a constituent, \u201cI\nagree with you, but I don\u2019t know if the government will.\u201d\nSee id., at 1. The collection of agencies housed outside the\ntraditional executive departments, including the Federal\nCommunications Commission, is routinely described as\nthe \u201cheadless fourth branch of government,\u201d reflecting not\nonly the scope of their authority but their practical inde-\npendence. See, e.g., Administrative Conference of United\nStates, D. Lewis & J. Selin, Sourcebook of United States\nExecutive Agencies 11 (2012).\n   As for judicial oversight, agencies enjoy broad power to\nconstrue statutory provisions over which they have been\ngiven interpretive authority. In Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., we established a\ntest for reviewing \u201can agency\u2019s construction of the statute\nwhich it administers.\u201d 467 U.

Congressional delegations to\nagencies are often ambiguous\u2014expressing \u201ca mood rather\nthan a message.\u201d Friendly, The Federal Administrative\nAgencies: The Need for Better Definition of Standards, 75\nHarv. L. Rev. 1263, 1311 (1962). By design or default,\nCongress often fails to speak to \u201cthe precise question\u201d\nbefore an agency. In the absence of such an answer, an\nagency\u2019s interpretation has the full force and effect of law,\nunless it \u201cexceeds the bounds of the permissible.\u201d Barn-\nhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 218 (2002).\n   It would be a bit much to describe the result as \u201cthe very\ndefinition of tyranny,\u201d but the danger posed by the grow-\ning power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed.\nSee, e.g., Talk America, Inc. v. Michigan Bell Telephone\nCo., 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (slip\nop., at 3) (noting that the FCC \u201chas repeatedly been re-\nbuked in its attempts to expand the statute beyond its\ntext, and has repeatedly sought new means to the same\nends\u201d); Sackett v.

And with hundreds of federal agencies poking into\nevery nook and cranny of daily life, that citizen might also\nunderstandably question whether Presidential oversight\u2014\na critical part of the Constitutional plan\u2014is always an\neffective safeguard against agency overreaching.\n   It is against this background that we consider whether\nthe authority of administrative agencies should be aug-\nmented even further, to include not only broad power to\ngive definitive answers to questions left to them by Con-\ngress, but also the same power to decide when Congress\nhas given them that power.\n   Before proceeding to answer that question, however, it\nis necessary to sort through some confusion over what this\nlitigation is about. The source of the confusion is a famil-\niar culprit: the concept of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d which we have\nrepeatedly described as a word with \u201c \u2018many, too many,\nmeanings.\u2019 \u201d Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,\n558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009).\n   The Court states that the question \u201cis whether a court\nmust defer under Chevron to an agency\u2019s interpretation of\na statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agen-\ncy\u2019s statutory authority (that is, its jurisdiction).\u201d Ante, at\n5. That is fine\u2014until the parenthetical. The parties,\namici, and court below too often use the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\nimprecisely, which leads the Court to misunderstand the\nargument it must confront. That argument is not that\n\u201cthere exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,\u201d\nsome \u201cbig, important ones\u201d that \u201cdefine the agency\u2019s \u2018juris-\ndiction,\u2019 \u201d and other \u201chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\u201d ones that\n\u201care simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly\nhas.\u201d Ibid. The argument is instead that a court should\nnot defer to an agency on whether Congress has granted\nthe agency interpretive authority over the statutory ambi-\nguity at issue.\n   You can call that \u201cjurisdiction\u201d if you\u2019d like, as petition-\ners do in the question presented. But given that the term\n6                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nis ambiguous, more is required to understand its use in\nthat question than simply \u201chaving read it.\u201d Ante, at 15,\nn. 5. It is important to keep in mind that the term, in the\npresent context, has the more precise meaning noted\nabove, encompassing congressionally delegated authority\nto issue interpretations with the force and effect of law.\nSee 668 F. 3d 229, 248 (CA5 2012) (case below) (\u201cThe issue\nin the instant case is whether the FCC possessed statutory\nauthority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) and (v) by adopt-\ning the 90- and 150-day time frames\u201d).

In Chevron, the EPA promulgated a regu-\nlation interpreting the term \u201cstationary sources\u201d in the\nClean Air Act. 467 U. S., at 840 (quoting 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a77502(b)(6)(1982 ed.)). An environmental group petitioned\nfor review of the rule, challenging it as an impermissible\ninterpretation of the Act. 467 U. S., at 841, 859. Finding\nthe statutory text \u201cnot dispositive\u201d and the legislative\nhistory \u201csilent on the precise issue,\u201d we upheld the rule.\nId., at 862, 866.\n  In our view, the challenge to the agency\u2019s interpretation\n\u201ccenter[ed] on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather\nthan whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left\nopen by Congress.\u201d Id., at 866. Judges, we said, \u201care not\nexperts in the field, and are not part of either political\nbranch of the Government.\u201d Id., at 865. Thus, because\nCongress had not answered the specific question at issue,\njudges had no business providing their own resolution on\nthe basis of their \u201cpersonal policy preferences.\u201d Ibid.\nInstead, the \u201cagency to which Congress ha[d] delegated\npolicymaking responsibilities\u201d was the appropriate politi-\n8                    ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncal actor to resolve the competing interests at stake, \u201cwithin\nthe limits of that delegation.\u201d Ibid.\n  Chevron\u2019s rule of deference was based on\u2014and limited\nby\u2014this congressional delegation. And the Court did not\nask simply whether Congress had delegated to the EPA\nthe authority to administer the Clean Air Act generally.\nWe asked whether Congress had \u201cdelegat[ed] authority to\nthe agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute\nby regulation.\u201d Id., at 843\u2013844 (emphasis added); see id.,\nat 844 (discussing \u201cthe legislative delegation to an agency\non a particular question\u201d (emphasis added)). We deferred\nto the EPA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cstationary sources\u201d based\non our conclusion that the agency had been \u201ccharged with\nresponsibility for administering the provision.\u201d Id., at 865\n(emphasis added).\n                              B\n   We have never faltered in our understanding of this\nstraightforward principle, that whether a particular agency\ninterpretation warrants Chevron deference turns on the\ncourt\u2019s determination whether Congress has delegated to\nthe agency the authority to interpret the statutory ambi-\nguity at issue.\n   We made the point perhaps most clearly in Adams Fruit\nCo. v. Barrett, 494 U. S. 638 (1990). In that case, the\nDepartment of Labor contended the Court should defer to\nits interpretation of the scope of the private right of action\nprovided by the Migrant and Seasonal Agriculture Worker\nProtection Act (AWPA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a71854, against employ-\ners who intentionally violated the Act\u2019s motor vehicle\nsafety provisions. We refused to do so. Although \u201cas an\ninitial matter\u201d we rejected the idea that Congress left a\n\u201cstatutory \u2018gap\u2019 \u201d for the agency to fill, we reasoned that if\nthe \u201cAWPA\u2019s language establishing a private right of\naction is ambiguous,\u201d the Secretary of Labor\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of its scope did not warrant Chevron deference. 494\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 649.\n   In language directly applicable to the question before us,\nwe explained that \u201c[a] precondition to deference under\nChevron is a congressional delegation of administrative\nauthority.\u201d Ibid. Although \u201cCongress clearly envisioned,\nindeed expressly mandated, a role for the Department of\nLabor in administering the statute by requiring the Secre-\ntary to promulgate standards implementing AWPA\u2019s\nmotor vehicle provisions,\u201d we found \u201c[n]o such delegation\nregarding AWPA\u2019s enforcement provisions.\u201d Id., at 650\n(emphasis added). It would therefore be \u201cinappropriate,\u201d\nwe said, \u201cto consult executive interpretations\u201d of the en-\nforcement provisions to resolve ambiguities \u201csurrounding\nthe scope of AWPA\u2019s judicially enforceable remedy.\u201d Ibid.\nWithout questioning the principle that agency determina-\ntions \u201cwithin the scope of delegated authority are entitled\nto deference,\u201d we explained that \u201cit is fundamental \u2018that\nan agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it\nhas no jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U. S. 726, 745 (1973)).\n   Our subsequent cases follow the same approach. In\nUnited States v. Mead Corp., supra, for example, Chevron\ndeference turned on whether Congress had delegated to\nthe agency authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity\nby a particular means. The Customs Service had issued a\n\u201cclassification ruling,\u201d interpreting the term \u201cdiaries\u201d in a\ntariff schedule to include \u201cday planners\u201d of the type Mead\nimported, and on that basis subjected the planners to a\nfour-percent tariff. Mead protested the imposition of the\ntariff, the Customs Service claimed Chevron deference for\nits interpretation, and the controversy made its way to our\nCourt. Id., at 224\u2013226.\n   In Mead, we again made clear that the \u201ccategory of\ninterpretative choices\u201d to which Chevron deference applies\nis defined by congressional intent. Id., at 229. Chevron\ndeference, we said, rests on a recognition that Congress\n10                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nhas delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to\nimplement \u201ca particular provision\u201d or answer \u201c \u2018a particu-\nlar question.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844).\nAn agency\u2019s interpretation of \u201ca particular statutory provi-\nsion\u201d thus qualifies for Chevron deference only \u201cwhen it\nappears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that\nthe agency interpretation claiming deference was pro-\nmulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d 533 U. S., at\n226\u2013227.\n   The Court did not defer to the agency\u2019s views but in-\nstead determined that Congress had not delegated inter-\npretive authority to the Customs Service to definitively\nconstrue the tariff schedule through classification rulings.\nNeither the statutory authorization for the classification\nrulings, nor the Customs Service\u2019s practice in issuing such\nrulings, \u201creasonably suggest[ed] that Congress ever\nthought of [such] classification rulings as deserving the\ndeference claimed for them.\u201d Id., at 231. And in the ab-\nsence of such a delegation, we concluded the interpreta-\ntions adopted in those rulings were \u201cbeyond the Chevron\npale.\u201d Id., at 234.\n   Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), is in the same\nline of precedent. In that case, as here, deference turned\non whether a congressional delegation of interpretive\nauthority reached a particular statutory ambiguity. The\nAttorney General claimed Chevron deference for his inter-\npretation of the phrase \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d in the\nControlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude the prescrib-\ning and dispensing of controlled substances for the pur-\npose of assisting suicide. Id., at 254, 258. No one disputed\nthat \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d was \u201cambiguous in the\nrelevant sense.\u201d Id., at 258. Nor did any Justice dispute\nthat the Attorney General had been granted the power in\nthe CSA to promulgate rules with the force of law. Ibid.;\nsee id., at 281 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Nevertheless, the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nCourt explained, \u201cChevron deference . . . is not accorded\nmerely because the statute is ambiguous and an adminis-\ntrative official is involved.\u201d Id., at 258. The regulation\nadvancing the interpretation, we said, \u201cmust be promul-\ngated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the\nofficial.\u201d Ibid. (citing Mead, supra, at 226\u2013227).\n   In the CSA, Congress delegated to the Attorney General\nthe authority to promulgate regulations \u201crelating to the\nregistration and control of the manufacture, distribution,\nand dispensing of controlled substances,\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7821,\nor \u201cfor the efficient execution of his functions under [the\nCSA],\u201d \u00a7871(b). After considering the text, structure, and\npurpose of the Act, the Court concluded on its own that\ninterpreting \u201clegitimate medical purpose\u201d fell under nei-\nther delegation. Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 258\u2013269. Because\nthe regulation \u201cwas not promulgated pursuant to the\nAttorney General\u2019s authority, its interpretation of \u2018legiti-\nmate medical purpose\u2019 d[id] not receive Chevron defer-\nence.\u201d Id., at 268.\n   Adams Fruit, Mead, and Gonzales thus confirm that\nChevron deference is based on, and finds legitimacy as, a\ncongressional delegation of interpretive authority. An\nagency interpretation warrants such deference only if\nCongress has delegated authority to definitively interpret\na particular ambiguity in a particular manner. Whether\nCongress has done so must be determined by the court on\nits own before Chevron can apply. See H. Edwards, L.\nElliot, & M. Levy, Federal Courts Standards of Review 168\n(2d ed. 2013) (\u201ca court decides de novo whether an agency\nhas acted within the bounds of congressionally delegated\nauthority\u201d (citing Mead, supra, at 226\u2013227, and Gonzales,\nsupra, at 258)); Sales & Adler, The Rest is Silence: Chevron\nDeference, Agency Jurisdiction, and Statutory Silences,\n2009 U. Ill. L. Rev. 1497, 1564 (2009) (\u201cif delegation\nreally is antecedent to deference, as Mead insists, it can-\nnot be that courts should defer to an agency\u2019s views on\n12                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nwhether a delegation has taken place\u201d).\n   In other words, we do not defer to an agency\u2019s interpre-\ntation of an ambiguous provision unless Congress wants\nus to, and whether Congress wants us to is a question that\ncourts, not agencies, must decide. Simply put, that ques-\ntion is \u201cbeyond the Chevron pale.\u201d Mead, supra, at 234.\n                              IV\n  Despite these precedents, the FCC argues that a court\nneed only locate an agency and a grant of general rule-\nmaking authority over a statute. Chevron deference then\napplies, it contends, to the agency\u2019s interpretation of any\nambiguity in the Act, including ambiguity in a provision\nsaid to carve out specific provisions from the agency\u2019s\ngeneral rulemaking authority. If Congress intends to\nexempt part of the statute from the agency\u2019s interpretive\nauthority, the FCC says, Congress \u201ccan ordinarily be\nexpected to state that intent explicitly.\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondents 30 (citing American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB,\n499 U. S. 606 (1991)).\n  If a congressional delegation of interpretive authority is\nto support Chevron deference, however, that delegation\nmust extend to the specific statutory ambiguity at issue.\nThe appropriate question is whether the delegation covers\nthe \u201cspecific provision\u201d and \u201cparticular question\u201d before\nthe court. Chevron, 467 U. S., at 844. A congressional\ngrant of authority over some portion of a statute does not\nnecessarily mean that Congress granted the agency inter-\npretive authority over all its provisions. See Adams Fruit,\n494 U. S., at 650.\n  An example that might highlight the point concerns\nstatutes that parcel out authority to multiple agencies,\nwhich \u201cmay be the norm, rather than an exception.\u201d\nGersen, Overlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in\nAdministrative Law, 2006 S. Ct. Rev. 201, 208; see, e.g.,\nGonzales, 546 U. S, at 250\u2013251 (describing shared author-\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nity over the CSA between the Attorney General and the\nSecretary of Health and Human Services); Sutton v. United\nAir Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 478 (1999) (authority to\nissue regulations implementing the Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act \u201cis split primarily among three Government\nagencies\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, for example, authorizes rule-\nmaking by at least eight different agencies. See Con-\ngressional Research Service, C. Copeland, Rulemaking\nRequirements and Authorities in the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act 7 (2010).\nWhen presented with an agency\u2019s interpretation of such a\nstatute, a court cannot simply ask whether the statute is\none that the agency administers; the question is whether\nauthority over the particular ambiguity at issue has been\ndelegated to the particular agency.\n   By the same logic, even when Congress provides inter-\npretive authority to a single agency, a court must decide if\nthe ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with\nthe force of law is one to which the congressional delega-\ntion extends. A general delegation to the agency to admin-\nister the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that\nCongress has delegated interpretive authority over the\nambiguity at issue. But if Congress has exempted particu-\nlar provisions from that authority, that exemption must be\nrespected, and the determination whether Congress has\ndone so is for the courts alone.\n   The FCC\u2019s argument that Congress \u201ccan ordinarily be\nexpected to state that intent explicitly,\u201d Brief for Federal\nRespondents 30 (citing American Hospital, supra), goes to\nthe merits of that determination, not to whether a court\nshould decide the question de novo or defer to the agency.\nIndeed, that is how the Court in American Hospital con-\nsidered it. It was in the process of \u201cemploying the tradi-\ntional tools of statutory construction\u201d that the Court said\nit would have expected Congress to speak more clearly if it\n14                  ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nhad intended to exclude an entire subject area\u2014employee\nunits for collecting bargaining\u2014from the NLRB\u2019s general\nrulemaking authority. Id., at 613, 614. The Court con-\ncluded, after considering the language, structure, policy,\nand legislative history of the Act on its own\u2014without\ndeferring to the agency\u2014that the meaning of the statute\nwas \u201cclear and contrary to the meaning advanced by peti-\ntioner.\u201d Id., at 609\u2013614. To be sure, the Court also noted\nthat \u201c[e]ven if we could find any ambiguity in [the provi-\nsion] after employing the traditional tools of statutory\nconstruction, we would still defer to Board\u2019s reasonable\ninterpretation.\u201d Id., at 614 (emphasis added). But that\nsingle sentence of dictum cannot carry the day for the FCC\nhere.\n                             V\n  As the preceding analysis makes clear, I do not under-\nstand petitioners to ask the Court\u2014nor do I think it\nnecessary\u2014to draw a \u201cspecious, but scary-sounding\u201d line\nbetween \u201cbig, important\u201d interpretations on the one hand\nand \u201chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\u201d ones on the other. Ante,\nat 5, 12. Drawing such a line may well be difficult. Dis-\ntinguishing between whether an agency\u2019s interpretation of\nan ambiguous term is reasonable and whether that term is\nfor the agency to interpret is not nearly so difficult. It\ncertainly did not confuse the FCC in this proceeding.\nCompare In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC\nRcd. 13994, 14000\u201314003 (2009) (addressing the latter\nquestion), with id., at 14003\u201314015 (addressing the for-\nmer). Nor did it confound the Fifth Circuit. Compare 668\nF. 3d, at 247\u2013254 (deciding \u201cwhether the FCC possessed\nstatutory authority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\u201d), with\nid., at 254\u2013260 (considering \u201cwhether the 90- and 150-day\ntime frames themselves also pass muster under Chevron\u201d).\nMore importantly, if the legitimacy of Chevron deference is\nbased on a congressional delegation of interpretive author-\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

J., dissenting\n\nity, then the line is one the Court must draw.\n   The majority\u2019s hypothetical Common Carrier Acts do not\ndemonstrate anything different. Ante, at 6\u20138. The major-\nity states that in its second Common Carrier Act, Section 2\nmakes clear that Congress \u201c \u2018conferred interpretative\npower on the agency\u2019 \u201d to interpret the ambiguous terms\n\u201ccommon carrier\u201d and \u201cunreasonable condition.\u201d Ante,\nat 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p. 14).\nThus, it says, under anyone\u2019s theory a court must defer to\nthe agency\u2019s reasonable interpretations of those terms.\nCorrect.\n   The majority claims, however, that \u201cpetitioners\u2019 theory\nwould accord the agency no deference\u201d in its interpretation\nof the same ambiguous terms in the first Common Carrier\nAct. Ante, at 7\u20138. But as I understand petitioners\u2019\nargument\u2014and certainly in my own view\u2014a court, in both\ncases, need only decide for itself whether Congress has\ndelegated to the agency authority to interpret the ambigu-\nous terms, before affording the agency\u2019s interpretation\nChevron deference.\n   For the second Common Carrier Act, the answer is easy.\nThe majority\u2019s hypothetical Congress has spoken clearly\nand specifically in Section 2 of the Act about its delegation\nof authority to interpret Section 1. As for the first Act, it\nis harder to analyze the question, given only one section of\na presumably much larger statute. But if the first Com-\nmon Carrier Act is like most agencies\u2019 organic statutes, I\nhave no reason to doubt that the agency would likewise\nhave interpretive authority over the same ambiguous\nterms, and therefore be entitled to deference in con-\nstruing them, just as with the second Common Carrier\nAct. There is no new \u201ctest\u201d to worry about, cf. ante, at 16;\ncourts would simply apply the normal rules of statutory\nconstruction.\n   That the question might be harder with respect to the\nfirst Common Carrier Act should come as no surprise. The\n16                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsecond hypothetical Congress has more carefully defined\nthe agency\u2019s authority than the first. Whatever standard\nof review applies, it is more difficult to interpret an un-\nclear statute than a clear one. My point is simply that\nbefore a court can defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of\nthe ambiguous terms in either Act, it must determine for\nitself that Congress has delegated authority to the agency\nto issue those interpretations with the force of law.\n   The majority also expresses concern that adopting peti-\ntioners\u2019 position would undermine Chevron\u2019s stable back-\nground rule against which Congress legislates. Ante, at 5.\nThat, of course, begs the question of what that stable\nbackground rule is. See Merrill & Hickman, Chevron\u2019s\nDomain, 89 Geo. L. Rev. 833, 910 (2001) (\u201cCourts have\nnever deferred to agencies with respect to questions such\nas whether Congress has delegated to an agency the power\nto act with the force of law through either legislative rules\nor binding adjudications. Similarly, it has never been\nmaintained that Congress would want courts to give Chev-\nron deference to an agency\u2019s determination that it is\nentitled to Chevron deference, or should give Chevron\ndeference to an agency\u2019s determination of what types of\ninterpretations are entitled to Chevron deference\u201d (foot-\nnote omitted)).\n                             VI\n   The Court sees something nefarious behind the view\nthat courts must decide on their own whether Congress\nhas delegated interpretative authority to an agency, before\ndeferring to that agency\u2019s interpretation of law. What is\nafoot, according to the Court, is a judicial power-grab, with\nnothing less than \u201cChevron itself \u201d as \u201cthe ultimate target.\u201d\nAnte, at 12.\n   The Court touches on a legitimate concern: Chevron\nimportantly guards against the Judiciary arrogating to\nitself policymaking properly left, under the separation of\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

But there is another concern at\nplay, no less firmly rooted in our constitutional structure.\nThat is the obligation of the Judiciary not only to confine\nitself to its proper role, but to ensure that the other\nbranches do so as well.\n   An agency\u2019s interpretive authority, entitling the agency\nto judicial deference, acquires its legitimacy from a delega-\ntion of lawmaking power from Congress to the Executive.\nOur duty to police the boundary between the Legislature\nand the Executive is as critical as our duty to respect that\nbetween the Judiciary and the Executive. See Zivotofsky\nv. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8). In the\npresent context, that means ensuring that the Legislative\nBranch has in fact delegated lawmaking power to an\nagency within the Executive Branch, before the Judiciary\ndefers to the Executive on what the law is. That concern\nis heightened, not diminished, by the fact that the admin-\nistrative agencies, as a practical matter, draw upon a\npotent brew of executive, legislative, and judicial power.\nAnd it is heightened, not diminished, by the dramatic\nshift in power over the last 50 years from Congress to the\nExecutive\u2014a shift effected through the administrative\nagencies.\n   We reconcile our competing responsibilities in this area\nby ensuring judicial deference to agency interpretations\nunder Chevron\u2014but only after we have determined on our\nown that Congress has given interpretive authority to the\nagency. Our \u201ctask is to fix the boundaries of delegated\nauthority,\u201d Monaghan, 83 Colum. L. Rev., at 27; that is\nnot a task we can delegate to the agency. We do not leave\nit to the agency to decide when it is in charge.\n                         *    *    *\n  In these cases, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling\ninterpreting the term \u201creasonable period of time\u201d in 47\nU. S. C. \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The Fifth Circuit correctly rec-\n18                   ARLINGTON v. FCC\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nognized that it could not apply Chevron deference to the\nFCC\u2019s interpretation unless the agency \u201cpossessed statu-\ntory authority to administer \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii),\u201d but it erred\nby granting Chevron deference to the FCC\u2019s view on that\nantecedent question. See 668 F. 3d, at 248. Because the\ncourt should have determined on its own whether Con-\ngress delegated interpretive authority over \u00a7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\nto the FCC before affording Chevron deference, I would\nvacate the decision below and remand the cases to the\nFifth Circuit to perform the proper inquiry in the first\ninstance.\n  I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
