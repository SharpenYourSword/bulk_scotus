Argued February 25, 2013\u2014Decided May 28, 2013\nIn Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, ___, this Court held that \u201ca procedural\n  default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial\n  claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State\u2019s] initial-review\n  collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that pro-\n  ceeding was ineffective.\u201d Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona,\n  where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim\n  during his first state collateral review proceeding. Ibid. This case\n  regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not\n  require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n  claim on collateral review. Rather, Texas law appears to permit a\n  prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and\n  design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner\n  to do so. The question presented in this case is whether, despite this\n  difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas.\n     Petitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state\n  court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigat-\n  ing circumstances to warrant a life sentence. Neither new counsel\n  appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state\n  collateral review raised the claim that Trevino\u2019s trial counsel provid-\n  ed ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to ade-\n  quately investigate and present mitigating circumstances. When\n  that claim was finally raised in Trevino\u2019s federal habeas petition, the\n  District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in\n  state court. The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted\n  because of Trevino\u2019s failure to raise it in his initial state postconvic-\n  tion proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this fail-\n2                          TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the fed-\n    eral courts from considering the claim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n    Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded\n    that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinez\u2019s good-cause\n    exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must in-\n    itially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial\n    state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to per-\n    mit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.\nHeld: Where, as here, a State\u2019s procedural framework, by reason of its\n design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a\n defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective-\n assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception rec-\n ognized in Martinez applies. Pp. 5\u201315.\n    (a) A finding that a defendant\u2019s state law \u201cprocedural default\u201d rests\n on \u201can independent and adequate state ground\u201d ordinarily prevents a\n federal habeas court from considering the defendant\u2019s federal consti-\n tutional claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,729\u2013730. How-\n ever, a \u201cprisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by\n showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the\n federal law.\u201d Martinez, supra, at ___. In Martinez, the Court recog-\n nized a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to Coleman\u2019s statement \u201cthat an attor-\n ney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does\n not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.\u201d 566 U. S., at\n ___. That exception allows a federal habeas court to find \u201ccause\u201d to\n excuse such default where (1) the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\n counsel claim was a \u201csubstantial\u201d claim; (2) the \u201ccause\u201d consisted of\n there being \u201cno counsel\u201d or only \u201cineffective\u201d counsel during the state\n collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceed-\n ing was the \u201cinitial\u201d review proceeding in respect to the \u201cineffective-\n assistance-of-trial-counsel claim\u201d; and (4) state law requires that the\n claim \u201cbe raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Id., at\n ___. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The difference between the Texas law\u2014which in theory grants\n permission to bring an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on\n direct appeal but in practice denies a meaningful opportunity to do\n so\u2014and the Arizona law at issue in Martinez\u2014which required the\n claim to be raised in an initial collateral review proceeding\u2014does not\n matter in respect to the application of Martinez. Pp. 8\u201314.\n      (1) This conclusion is supported by two characteristics of Texas\u2019\n procedures. First, Texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an\n ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to be presented on direct\n review. The nature of an ineffective-assistance claim means that the\n trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim. And a\n motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate be-\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cause of Texas rules regarding time limits on the filing, and the dis-\n  posal, of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts. Thus,\n  a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts neces-\n  sary for evaluating these claims in Texas. Second, were Martinez not\n  to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant un-\n  fairness because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to\n  raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on collateral, rath-\n  er than on direct, review. Texas can point to only a few cases in\n  which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to\n  expand the record on appeal. Texas suggests that there are other\n  mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal,\n  but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application,\n  and cannot overcome the Texas courts\u2019 own well-supported determi-\n  nation that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural\n  route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Re-\n  spondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here, where\n  appellate counsel\u2019s failure to bring a substantial ineffective-\n  assistance claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the\n  procedural default, but respondent points to no case in which such a\n  failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffec-\n  tive. Pp. 8\u201313.\n       (2) The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow excep-\n  tion to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for applying that excep-\n  tion here. The right involved\u2014adequate assistance of trial counsel\u2014\n  is similarly and critically important. In both instances practical con-\n  siderations\u2014the need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial\n  court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim\u2014\n  argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral,\n  not on direct, review. See Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___. In both in-\n  stances failure to consider a lawyer\u2019s \u201cineffectiveness\u201d during an ini-\n  tial-review collateral proceeding as a potential \u201ccause\u201d for excusing a\n  procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for\n  review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See id., at\n  ___. Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State\n  that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a\n  State that grants permission but denies a fair, meaningful opportuni-\n  ty to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.

Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), we considered\nthe right of a state prisoner to raise, in a federal habeas\ncorpus proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel. In that case an Arizona procedural rule required\na defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel during his first state collateral\nreview proceeding\u2014or lose the claim. The defendant in\nMartinez did not comply with the state procedural rule.\nBut he argued that the federal habeas court should excuse\nhis state procedural failing, on the ground that he had\ngood \u201ccause\u201d for not raising the claim at the right time,\nnamely that, not only had he lacked effective counsel\nduring trial, but also he lacked effective counsel during his\nfirst state collateral review proceeding.\n   We held that lack of counsel on collateral review might\nexcuse defendant\u2019s state law procedural default. We\nwrote:\n    \u201c[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas\n2                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective\n    assistance at trial if, in the [State\u2019s] initial-review col-\n    lateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in\n    that proceeding was ineffective.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\n    at 15).\nAt the same time we qualified our holding. We said\nthat the holding applied where state procedural law said\nthat \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must\nbe raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   In this case Texas state law does not say \u201cmust.\u201d It does\nnot on its face require a defendant initially to raise an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a state col-\nlateral review proceeding. Rather, that law appears at\nfirst glance to permit (but not require) the defendant\ninitially to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal. The structure and design of the\nTexas system in actual operation, however, make it \u201cvir-\ntually impossible\u201d for an ineffective assistance claim to be\npresented on direct review. See Robinson v. State, 16\nS. W. 3d 808, 810\u2013811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We must\nnow decide whether the Martinez exception applies in this\nprocedural regime. We conclude that it does.\n                               I\n  A Texas state court jury convicted petitioner, Carlos\nTrevino, of capital murder. After a subsequent penalty-\nphase hearing, the jury found that Trevino \u201cwould commit\ncriminal acts of violence in the future which would consti-\ntute a continuing threat to society,\u201d that he \u201cactually\ncaused the death of Linda Salinas or, if he did not actually\ncause her death, he intended to kill her or another, or he\nanticipated a human life would be taken,\u201d and that \u201cthere\nwere insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a\nsentence of life imprisonment\u201d rather than death. 449\nFed. Appx. 415, 418 (CA5 2011). The judge consequently\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimposed a sentence of death.\n   Eight days later the judge appointed new counsel to\nhandle Trevino\u2019s direct appeal. App. 1, 3. Seven months\nafter sentencing, when the trial transcript first became\navailable, that counsel filed an appeal. The Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals then considered and rejected Trevino\u2019s\nappellate claims. Trevino\u2019s appellate counsel did not\nclaim that Trevino\u2019s trial counsel had been constitutionally\nineffective during the penalty phase of the trial court pro-\nceedings. Id., at 12\u201324.\n   About six months after sentencing, the trial judge ap-\npointed Trevino a different new counsel to seek state\ncollateral relief. As Texas\u2019 procedural rules provide, that\nthird counsel initiated collateral proceedings while Tre-\nvino\u2019s appeal still was in progress. This new counsel first\nsought postconviction relief (through collateral review) in\nthe trial court itself. After a hearing, the trial court de-\nnied relief; and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\naffirmed that denial. Id., at 25\u201326, 321\u2013349. Trevino\u2019s\npostconviction claims included a claim that his trial coun-\nsel was constitutionally ineffective during the penalty\nphase of Trevino\u2019s trial, but it did not include a claim that\ntrial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness consisted in part of a failure\nadequately to investigate and to present mitigating circum-\nstances during the penalty phase of Trevino\u2019s trial. Id., at\n321\u2013349; see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 523 (2003)\n(counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating\ncircumstances deprived defendant of effective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Trevino then filed a petition in federal court seeking a\nwrit of habeas corpus. The Federal District Court ap-\npointed another new counsel to represent him. And that\ncounsel claimed for the first time that Trevino had not\nreceived constitutionally effective counsel during the\npenalty phase of his trial in part because of trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to adequately investigate and present mitigating\n4                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances during the penalty phase. App. 438, 456\u2013\n478. Federal habeas counsel pointed out that Trevino\u2019s\ntrial counsel had presented only one witness at the sen-\ntencing phase, namely Trevino\u2019s aunt. The aunt had\ntestified that Trevino had had a difficult upbringing, that\nhis mother had an alcohol problem, that his family was on\nwelfare, and that he had dropped out of high school. She\nhad added that Trevino had a child, that he was good with\nchildren, and that he was not violent. Id., at 285\u2013291.\n   Federal habeas counsel then told the federal court that\nTrevino\u2019s trial counsel should have found and presented at\nthe penalty phase other mitigating matters that his own\ninvestigation had brought to light. These included, among\nother things, that Trevino\u2019s mother abused alcohol while\nshe was pregnant with Trevino, that Trevino weighed only\nfour pounds at birth, that throughout his life Trevino\nsuffered the deleterious effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,\nthat as a child Trevino had suffered numerous head inju-\nries without receiving adequate medical attention, that\nTrevino\u2019s mother had abused him physically and emotion-\nally, that from an early age Trevino was exposed to, and\nabused, alcohol and drugs, that Trevino had attended\nschool irregularly and performed poorly, and that Tre-\nvino\u2019s cognitive abilities were impaired. Id., at 66\u201367.\n   The federal court stayed proceedings to permit Trevino\nto raise this claim in state court. The state court held that\nbecause Trevino had not raised this claim during his\ninitial postconviction proceedings, he had procedurally\ndefaulted the claim, id., at 27\u201328; and the Federal District\nCourt then denied Trevino\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel claim, id., at 78\u201379. The District Court concluded\nin relevant part that, despite the fact that \u201ceven the most\nminimal investigation . . . would have revealed a wealth\nof additional mitigating evidence,\u201d an independent and\nadequate state ground (namely Trevino\u2019s failure to raise\nthe issue during his state postconviction proceeding)\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbarred the federal habeas court from considering the\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Id., at 131\u2013\n132. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729\u2013730\n(1991).\n  Trevino appealed. The Fifth Circuit, without consider-\ning the merits of Trevino\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel claim, agreed with the District Court that an\nindependent, adequate state ground, namely Trevino\u2019s\nprocedural default, barred its consideration. 449 Fed.\nAppx., at 426. Although the Circuit decided Trevino\u2019s case\nbefore this Court decided Martinez, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning in a later case, Ibarra v. Thaler, 687 F. 3d 222\n(2012), makes clear that the Fifth Circuit would have\nfound that Martinez would have made no difference.\n  That is because in Ibarra the Circuit recognized that\nMartinez had said that its good-cause exception applies\nwhere state law says that a criminal defendant must\ninitially raise his claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel in initial state collateral review proceedings. 687\nF. 3d, at 225\u2013226. Texas law, the Circuit pointed out, does\nnot say explicitly that the defendant must initially raise\nthe claim in state collateral review proceedings. Rather\nTexas law on its face appears to permit a criminal defend-\nant to raise such a claim on direct appeal. Id., at 227.\nAnd the Circuit held that that fact means that Martinez\ndoes not apply in Texas. 687 F. 3d, at 227. Since the\nCircuit\u2019s holding in Ibarra (that Martinez does not apply\nin Texas) would similarly govern this case, we granted\ncertiorari here to determine whether Martinez applies in\nTexas.\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  We begin with Martinez. We there recognized the his-\ntoric importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as\na method for preventing individuals from being held in\n6                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncustody in violation of federal law. Martinez, 566 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). See generally Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n411 U. S. 475, 484\u2013485 (1973). In general, if a convicted\nstate criminal defendant can show a federal habeas court\nthat his conviction rests upon a violation of the Federal\nConstitution, he may well obtain a writ of habeas corpus\nthat requires a new trial, a new sentence, or release.\n  We similarly recognized the importance of federal ha-\nbeas corpus principles designed to prevent federal courts\nfrom interfering with a State\u2019s application of its own firmly\nestablished, consistently followed, constitutionally proper\nprocedural rules. Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n6\u20137). Those principles have long made clear that a\nconviction that rests upon a defendant\u2019s state law \u201cproce-\ndural default\u201d (for example, the defendant\u2019s failure to raise\na claim of error at the time or in the place that state law\nrequires), normally rests upon \u201can independent and ade-\nquate state ground.\u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729\u2013730.\nAnd where a conviction rests upon such a ground, a fed-\neral habeas court normally cannot consider the defendant\u2019s\nfederal constitutional claim. Ibid.; see Martinez, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n  At the same time, we pointed out that \u201c[t]he doctrine\nbarring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is\nnot without exceptions. A prisoner may obtain federal\nreview of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the de-\nfault and prejudice from a violation of federal law.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). And we turned to the issue directly\nbefore the Court: whether Martinez had shown \u201ccause\u201d to\nexcuse his state procedural failing. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 15).\n  Martinez argued that his lawyer should have raised, but\ndid not raise, his claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel during state collateral review proceedings. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 4). He added that this failure, itself\namounting to ineffective assistance, was the \u201ccause\u201d of,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand ought to excuse, his procedural default. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 4). But this Court had previously held that\n\u201c[n]egligence on the part of a prisoner\u2019s postconviction\nattorney does not qualify as \u2018cause,\u2019 \u201d primarily because a\n\u201cprincipal\u201d such as the prisoner, \u201cbears the risk of negli-\ngent conduct on the part of his agent,\u201d the attorney. Ma-\nples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Coleman, supra, at 753\u2013754; emphasis added).\nMartinez, in effect, argued for an exception to Coleman\u2019s\nbroad statement of the law.\n   We ultimately held that a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d should\n\u201cmodify the unqualified statement in Coleman that an\nattorney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction\nproceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a proce-\ndural default.\u201d Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We\ndid so for three reasons. First, the \u201cright to the effective\nassistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our\njustice system. . . . Indeed, the right to counsel is the\nfoundation for our adversary system.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 9).\n   Second, ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appel-\nlate review could amount to \u201ccause,\u201d excusing a defend-\nant\u2019s failure to raise (and thus procedurally defaulting) a\nconstitutional claim. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). But States\noften have good reasons for initially reviewing claims of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collat-\neral proceedings rather than on direct appellate review.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310). That is because review of\nsuch a claim normally requires a different attorney, be-\ncause it often \u201cdepend[s] on evidence outside the trial\nrecord,\u201d and because efforts to expand the record on direct\nappeal may run afoul of \u201c[a]bbreviated deadlines,\u201d depriv-\ning the new attorney of \u201cadequate time . . . to investigate\nthe ineffective-assistance claim.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10).\n   Third, where the State consequently channels initial\n8                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreview of this constitutional claim to collateral proceed-\nings, a lawyer\u2019s failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-\nof-trial-counsel claim during initial-review collateral\nproceedings, could (were Coleman read broadly) deprive a\ndefendant of any review of that claim at all. Martinez,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   We consequently read Coleman as containing an excep-\ntion, allowing a federal habeas court to find \u201ccause,\u201d\nthereby excusing a defendant\u2019s procedural default, where\n(1) the claim of \u201cineffective assistance of trial counsel\u201d was\na \u201csubstantial\u201d claim; (2) the \u201ccause\u201d consisted of there\nbeing \u201cno counsel\u201d or only \u201cineffective\u201d counsel during the\nstate collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral\nreview proceeding was the \u201cinitial\u201d review proceeding in\nrespect to the \u201cineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim\u201d; and (4) state law requires that an \u201cineffective\nassistance of trial counsel [claim] . . . be raised in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Martinez, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 11, 15).\n                              B\n   Here state law differs from that in Martinez in respect\nto the fourth requirement. Unlike Arizona, Texas does not\nexpressly require the defendant to raise a claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel in an initial collateral\nreview proceeding. Rather Texas law on its face appears\nto permit (but not require) the defendant to raise the claim\non direct appeal. Does this difference matter?\n                              1\n  Two characteristics of the relevant Texas procedures\nlead us to conclude that it should not make a difference in\nrespect to the application of Martinez. First, Texas proce-\ndure makes it \u201cvirtually impossible for appellate counsel\nto adequately present an ineffective assistance [of trial\ncounsel] claim\u201d on direct review. Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n810\u2013811. As the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals itself\nhas pointed out, \u201cthe inherent nature of most ineffective\nassistance\u201d of trial counsel \u201cclaims\u201d means that the trial\ncourt record will often fail to \u201ccontai[n] the information\nnecessary to substantiate\u201d the claim. Ex parte Torres, 943\nS. W. 2d 469, 475 (1997) (en banc).\n   As the Court of Criminal Appeals has also noted, a\nconvicted defendant may make a motion in the trial court\nfor a new trial in order to develop the record on appeal.\nSee Reyes v. State, 849 S. W. 2d 812, 816 (1993). And, in\nprinciple, the trial court could, in connection with that\nmotion, allow the defendant some additional time to de-\nvelop a further record. Ibid. But that motion-for-new-trial\n\u201cvehicle is often inadequate because of time constraints\nand because the trial record has generally not been tran-\nscribed at this point.\u201d Torres, supra, at 475. See Tex. Rule\nApp. Proc. 21.4 (2013) (motion for a new trial must be\nmade within 30 days of sentencing); Rules 21.8(a), (c) (trial\ncourt must dispose of motion within 75 days of sentenc-\ning); Rules 35.2(b), 35.3(c) (transcript must be prepared\nwithin 120 days of sentencing where a motion for a new\ntrial is filed and this deadline may be extended). Thus, as\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals has concluded, in Texas \u201ca\nwrit of habeas corpus\u201d issued in state collateral proceed-\nings ordinarily \u201cis essential to gathering the facts neces-\nsary to . . . evaluate . . . [ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel] claims.\u201d Torres, supra, at 475. See Robinson,\nsupra, at 810\u2013811 (noting that there is \u201cnot generally a\nrealistic opportunity to adequately develop the record for\nappeal in post-trial motions\u201d and that \u201c[t]he time require-\nments for filing and presenting a motion for new trial\nwould have made it virtually impossible for appellate\ncounsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance\nclaim to the trial court\u201d).\n   See also Thompson v.

The present capital case illus-\ntrates why it does not. The trial court appointed new\ncounsel for Trevino eight days after sentencing. Counsel\nthus had 22 days to decide whether, and on what grounds,\nto make a motion for a new trial. She then may have had\nan additional 45 days to provide support for the motion\nbut without the help of a transcript (which did not become\navailable until much later\u2014seven months after the trial).\nIt would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, within\nthat time frame to investigate Trevino\u2019s background, de-\ntermine whether trial counsel had adequately done so,\nand then develop evidence about additional mitigating\nbackground circumstances. See Reyes, supra, at 816\n(\u201c[M]otions for new trial [must] be supported by affidavit\n. . . specifically showing the truth of the grounds of\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

That\nis because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants\nto raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\non collateral, rather than on direct, review. As noted, they\nhave explained why direct review proceedings are likely\ninadequate. See supra, at 8\u201310. They have held that\nfailure to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the\ndefendant from raising the claim in collateral proceedings.\nSee, e.g., Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at 813; Ex parte Duffy,\n607 S. W. 2d 507, 512\u2013513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (over-\nruled on other grounds by Hernandez v. State, 988 S. W.\n2d 770 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)). They have held that the\ndefendant\u2019s decision to raise the claim on direct review\ndoes not bar the defendant from also raising the claim in\ncollateral proceedings. See, e.g., Lopez v. State, 343 S. W.\n3d 137, 143 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Torres, supra, at 475.\nThey have suggested that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to\nraise the claim on direct review does not constitute \u201cinef-\nfective assistance of counsel.\u201d See Sprouse v. State, No.\nAP\u201374933, 2007 WL 283152, *7 (Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 31,\n2007) (unpublished). And Texas\u2019 highest criminal court\nhas explicitly stated that \u201c[a]s a general rule\u201d the de-\nfendant \u201cshould not raise an issue of ineffective assistance\nof counsel on direct appeal,\u201d but rather in collateral re-\nview proceedings. Mata v. State, 226 S. W. 3d 425, 430,\nn. 14 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). See Rob-\ninson, supra, at 810 (\u201c[A] post-conviction writ proceeding,\nrather than a motion for new trial, is the preferred method\nfor gathering the facts necessary to substantiate\u201d an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim).\n   The criminal bar, not surprisingly, has taken this strong\njudicial advice seriously. See Guidelines and Standards\nfor Texas Capital Counsel, 69 Tex. B. J. 966, 977, Guide-\nline 12.2(B)(1)(d) (2006) (\u201c[S]tate habeas corpus is the first\n12                   TREVINO v.

Texas now\ncan point to only a comparatively small number of cases in\nwhich a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial\nmechanism to expand the record on appeal and then re-\nceived a hearing on his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel claim on direct appeal. Brief for Respondent\n35\u201336, and n. 6 (citing, inter alia, State v. Morales, 253 S. W.\n3d 686, 689\u2013691 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Robertson v.\nState, 187 S. W. 3d 475, 480\u2013481 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).\nAnd, of those, precisely one case involves trial counsel\u2019s\ninvestigative failures of the kind at issue here. See Arm-\nstrong v. State, No. AP\u201375706, 2010 WL 359020 (Tex.\nCrim. App., Jan. 27, 2010) (unpublished). How could\nfederal law deny defendants the benefit of Martinez solely\nbecause of the existence of a theoretically available pro-\ncedural alternative, namely direct appellate review, that\nTexas procedures render so difficult, and in the typical\ncase all but impossible, to use successfully, and which\nTexas courts so strongly discourage defendants from\nusing?\n   Respondent argues that Texas courts enforce the rele-\nvant time limits more flexibly than we have suggested.\nSometimes, for example, an appellate court can abate an\nappeal and remand the case for further record develop-\nment in the trial court. See Cooks v. State, 240 S. W. 3d\n906 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). But the procedural possibili-\nties to which Texas now points seem special, limited in\ntheir application, and, as far as we can tell, rarely used.\nSee 43A Texas Practice \u00a750:15, at 636\u2013639; 43B id.,\n\u00a756:235, at 607\u2013609. Cooks, for example, the case upon\nwhich respondent principally relies, involved a remand for\nfurther record development, but in circumstances where\nthe lower court wrongly failed to give a defendant new\ncounsel in time to make an ordinary new trial motion. 240\nS. W. 3d, at 911. We do not believe that this, or other,\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecial, rarely used procedural possibilities can overcome\nthe Texas courts\u2019 own well-supported determination that\ncollateral review normally constitutes the preferred\u2014and\nindeed as a practical matter, the only\u2014method for raising\nan ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\n  Respondent further argues that there is no equitable\nproblem to be solved in Texas because if counsel fails to\nbring a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal, the ineffectiveness of appellate\ncounsel may constitute cause to excuse the procedural\ndefault. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986). But\nrespondent points to no case in which such a failure by\nappellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally inef-\nfective. And that lack of authority is not surprising given\nthe fact that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\ndirected defendants to bring such claims on collateral\nreview.\n                              2\n   For the reasons just stated, we believe that the Texas\nprocedural system\u2014as a matter of its structure, design,\nand operation\u2014does not offer most defendants a meaning-\nful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel on direct appeal. What the Arizona law\nprohibited by explicit terms, Texas law precludes as a\nmatter of course. And, that being so, we can find no signif-\nicant difference between this case and Martinez. The very\nfactors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to\nColeman in Martinez similarly argue for the application of\nthat exception here.\n   The right involved\u2014adequate assistance of counsel at\ntrial\u2014is similarly and critically important. In both in-\nstances practical considerations, such as the need for a\nnew lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and\nthe need for sufficient time to develop the claim, argue\nstrongly for initial consideration of the claim during col-\n14                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlateral, rather than on direct, review. See Martinez, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); see also Massaro v. United\nStates, 538 U. S. 500, 505 (2003). In both instances failure\nto consider a lawyer\u2019s \u201cineffectiveness\u201d during an initial-\nreview collateral proceeding as a potential \u201ccause\u201d for\nexcusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant\nof any opportunity at all for review of an ineffective-\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See Martinez, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a\nState that denies permission to raise the claim on direct\nappeal and (2) a State that in theory grants permission\nbut, as a matter of procedural design and systemic opera-\ntion, denies a meaningful opportunity to do so is a distinc-\ntion without a difference. In saying this, we do not (any\nmore than we did in Martinez) seek to encourage States\nto tailor direct appeals so that they provide a fuller op-\nportunity to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaims. That is a matter for the States to decide. And, as\nwe have said, there are often good reasons for hearing the\nclaim initially during collateral proceedings.\n                            III\n  For these reasons, we conclude that where, as here,\nstate procedural framework, by reason of its design and\noperation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that\na defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct\nappeal, our holding in Martinez applies:\n     \u201c[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas\n     court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective\n     assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral\n     proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that\n     proceeding was ineffective.\u201d 566 U.

But we simultaneously recognized that \u201c[a]\ndifferent allocation of costs is appropriate in those circum-\nstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure\nthat the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.\u201d\nIbid. In that situation, we held, \u201cit is the petitioner who\nmust bear the burden of a failure to follow state proce-\ndural rules.\u201d Ibid. Because the error in Coleman occurred\nduring state postconviction proceedings, a point at which\nthe habeas petitioner had no constitutional right to coun-\nsel, the petitioner had to bear the cost of his default.

S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 14).\n   Today, with hardly a mention of these concerns, the\nmajority throws over the crisp limit we made so explicit\njust last Term. We announced in Martinez that the excep-\ntion applies \u201cwhere the State barred the defendant from\nraising the claims on direct appeal.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14). But today, the Court takes all the starch out of its\nrule with an assortment of adjectives, adverbs, and modi-\nfying clauses: Martinez\u2019s \u201cnarrow exception\u201d now applies\nwhenever the \u201cstate procedural framework, by reason of\nits design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a\ntypical case that a defendant will have a meaningful\nopportunity\u201d to raise his claim on direct appeal. Ante, at\n14.\n   The questions raised by this equitable equation are as\nendless as will be the state-by-state litigation it takes to\nwork them out. We are not told, for example, how mean-\ningful is meaningful enough, how meaningful-ness is to be\nmeasured, how unlikely highly unlikely is, how often a\nprocedural framework\u2019s \u201coperation\u201d must be reassessed, or\nwhat case qualifies as the \u201ctypical\u201d case. Take just this\nlast example: The case before us involved a jury trial\n(hardly typical), a capital conviction (even less typical),\nand\u2014as the majority emphasizes\u2014a particular species of\nineffectiveness claim that depends on time-consuming\ninvestigation of personal background and other mitigating\ncircumstances. Ante, at 10. Yet the majority holds it up,\napparently, as a case that is typical in the relevant sense,\nsaying that \u201c[t]he present capital case illustrates\u201d the\n\u201csystematic\u201d working of Texas\u2019s procedural framework.\nIbid.\n   Given that the standard is so opaque and malleable, the\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Gone are the repeated words\nof limitation that characterized the Martinez opinion.\nGone too is the clear choice that Martinez gave the States\nabout how to structure their criminal justice systems.\nNow, the majority offers them a gamble: If a State allows\ndefendants to bring ineffectiveness claims both on direct\nappeal and in postconviction proceedings, then a prisoner\nmight have to comply with state procedural requirements\nin order to preserve the availability of federal habeas\nreview, if a federal judge decides that the state system\ngave the defendant (or enough other \u201ctypical\u201d defendants)\na sufficiently meaningful opportunity to press his claim.\n   This invitation to litigation will, in precisely the manner\nthat Coleman foreclosed, \u201c \u2018frustrate both the States\u2019 sov-\nereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith\nattempts to honor constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 748 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128\n(1982)). In what I suspect (though cannot know) will be a\nbroad swath of cases, the Court\u2019s approach will excuse\nprocedural defaults that, under Coleman, should preclude\nfederal review. But even in cases where federal courts\nultimately decide that the habeas petitioner cannot estab-\nlish cause under the new standard, the years of procedural\nwrangling it takes to reach that decision will themselves\nundermine the finality of sentences necessary to effective\ncriminal justice. Because that approach is inconsistent\nwith Coleman, Martinez itself, and the principles of equi-\ntable discretion and comity at the heart of both, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Argued February 25, 2013\u2014Decided May 28, 2013\nIn Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, ___, this Court held that \u201ca procedural\n  default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial\n  claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the [State\u2019s] initial-review\n  collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that pro-\n  ceeding was ineffective.\u201d Martinez regarded a prisoner from Arizona,\n  where state procedural law required the prisoner to raise the claim\n  during his first state collateral review proceeding. Ibid. This case\n  regards a prisoner from Texas, where state procedural law does not\n  require a defendant to raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\n  claim on collateral review. Rather, Texas law appears to permit a\n  prisoner to raise such a claim on direct review, but the structure and\n  design of the Texas system make it virtually impossible for a prisoner\n  to do so. The question presented in this case is whether, despite this\n  difference, the rule set out in Martinez applies in Texas.\n     Petitioner Trevino was convicted of capital murder in Texas state\n  court and sentenced to death after the jury found insufficient mitigat-\n  ing circumstances to warrant a life sentence. Neither new counsel\n  appointed for his direct appeal nor new counsel appointed for state\n  collateral review raised the claim that Trevino\u2019s trial counsel provid-\n  ed ineffective assistance during the penalty phase by failing to ade-\n  quately investigate and present mitigating circumstances. When\n  that claim was finally raised in Trevino\u2019s federal habeas petition, the\n  District Court stayed the proceedings so Trevino could raise it in\n  state court. The state court found the claim procedurally defaulted\n  because of Trevino\u2019s failure to raise it in his initial state postconvic-\n  tion proceedings, and the federal court then concluded that this fail-\n2                          TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    ure was an independent and adequate state ground barring the fed-\n    eral courts from considering the claim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n    Its decision predated Martinez, but that court has since concluded\n    that Martinez does not apply in Texas because Martinez\u2019s good-cause\n    exception applies only where state law says that a defendant must in-\n    itially raise his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in initial\n    state collateral review proceedings, while Texas law appears to per-\n    mit a defendant to raise that claim on direct appeal.\nHeld: Where, as here, a State\u2019s procedural framework, by reason of its\n design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a\n defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise an ineffective-\n assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal, the exception rec-\n ognized in Martinez applies. Pp. 5\u201315.\n    (a) A finding that a defendant\u2019s state law \u201cprocedural default\u201d rests\n on \u201can independent and adequate state ground\u201d ordinarily prevents a\n federal habeas court from considering the defendant\u2019s federal consti-\n tutional claim. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722,729\u2013730. How-\n ever, a \u201cprisoner may obtain federal review of a defaulted claim by\n showing cause for the default and prejudice from a violation of the\n federal law.\u201d Martinez, supra, at ___. In Martinez, the Court recog-\n nized a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to Coleman\u2019s statement \u201cthat an attor-\n ney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does\n not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.\u201d 566 U. S., at\n ___. That exception allows a federal habeas court to find \u201ccause\u201d to\n excuse such default where (1) the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\n counsel claim was a \u201csubstantial\u201d claim; (2) the \u201ccause\u201d consisted of\n there being \u201cno counsel\u201d or only \u201cineffective\u201d counsel during the state\n collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral review proceed-\n ing was the \u201cinitial\u201d review proceeding in respect to the \u201cineffective-\n assistance-of-trial-counsel claim\u201d; and (4) state law requires that the\n claim \u201cbe raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Id., at\n ___. Pp. 5\u20138.\n    (b) The difference between the Texas law\u2014which in theory grants\n permission to bring an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on\n direct appeal but in practice denies a meaningful opportunity to do\n so\u2014and the Arizona law at issue in Martinez\u2014which required the\n claim to be raised in an initial collateral review proceeding\u2014does not\n matter in respect to the application of Martinez. Pp. 8\u201314.\n      (1) This conclusion is supported by two characteristics of Texas\u2019\n procedures. First, Texas procedures make it nearly impossible for an\n ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim to be presented on direct\n review. The nature of an ineffective-assistance claim means that the\n trial record is likely to be insufficient to support the claim. And a\n motion for a new trial to develop the record is usually inadequate be-\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  cause of Texas rules regarding time limits on the filing, and the dis-\n  posal, of such motions and the availability of trial transcripts. Thus,\n  a writ of habeas corpus is normally needed to gather the facts neces-\n  sary for evaluating these claims in Texas. Second, were Martinez not\n  to apply, the Texas procedural system would create significant un-\n  fairness because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants to\n  raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on collateral, rath-\n  er than on direct, review. Texas can point to only a few cases in\n  which a defendant has used the motion-for-a-new-trial mechanism to\n  expand the record on appeal. Texas suggests that there are other\n  mechanisms by which a prisoner can expand the record on appeal,\n  but these mechanisms seem special and limited in their application,\n  and cannot overcome the Texas courts\u2019 own well-supported determi-\n  nation that collateral review normally is the preferred procedural\n  route for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. Re-\n  spondent also argues that there is no equitable problem here, where\n  appellate counsel\u2019s failure to bring a substantial ineffective-\n  assistance claim on direct appeal may constitute cause to excuse the\n  procedural default, but respondent points to no case in which such a\n  failure by appellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally ineffec-\n  tive. Pp. 8\u201313.\n       (2) The very factors that led this Court to create a narrow excep-\n  tion to Coleman in Martinez similarly argue for applying that excep-\n  tion here. The right involved\u2014adequate assistance of trial counsel\u2014\n  is similarly and critically important. In both instances practical con-\n  siderations\u2014the need for a new lawyer, the need to expand the trial\n  court record, and the need for sufficient time to develop the claim\u2014\n  argue strongly for initial consideration of the claim during collateral,\n  not on direct, review. See Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___. In both in-\n  stances failure to consider a lawyer\u2019s \u201cineffectiveness\u201d during an ini-\n  tial-review collateral proceeding as a potential \u201ccause\u201d for excusing a\n  procedural default will deprive the defendant of any opportunity for\n  review of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See id., at\n  ___. Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a State\n  that denies permission to raise the claim on direct appeal and (2) a\n  State that grants permission but denies a fair, meaningful opportuni-\n  ty to develop the claim is a distinction without a difference.

Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012), we considered\nthe right of a state prisoner to raise, in a federal habeas\ncorpus proceeding, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel. In that case an Arizona procedural rule required\na defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel during his first state collateral\nreview proceeding\u2014or lose the claim. The defendant in\nMartinez did not comply with the state procedural rule.\nBut he argued that the federal habeas court should excuse\nhis state procedural failing, on the ground that he had\ngood \u201ccause\u201d for not raising the claim at the right time,\nnamely that, not only had he lacked effective counsel\nduring trial, but also he lacked effective counsel during his\nfirst state collateral review proceeding.\n   We held that lack of counsel on collateral review might\nexcuse defendant\u2019s state law procedural default. We\nwrote:\n    \u201c[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas\n2                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective\n    assistance at trial if, in the [State\u2019s] initial-review col-\n    lateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in\n    that proceeding was ineffective.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\n    at 15).\nAt the same time we qualified our holding. We said\nthat the holding applied where state procedural law said\nthat \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must\nbe raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added).\n   In this case Texas state law does not say \u201cmust.\u201d It does\nnot on its face require a defendant initially to raise an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim in a state col-\nlateral review proceeding. Rather, that law appears at\nfirst glance to permit (but not require) the defendant\ninitially to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal. The structure and design of the\nTexas system in actual operation, however, make it \u201cvir-\ntually impossible\u201d for an ineffective assistance claim to be\npresented on direct review. See Robinson v. State, 16\nS. W. 3d 808, 810\u2013811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). We must\nnow decide whether the Martinez exception applies in this\nprocedural regime. We conclude that it does.\n                               I\n  A Texas state court jury convicted petitioner, Carlos\nTrevino, of capital murder. After a subsequent penalty-\nphase hearing, the jury found that Trevino \u201cwould commit\ncriminal acts of violence in the future which would consti-\ntute a continuing threat to society,\u201d that he \u201cactually\ncaused the death of Linda Salinas or, if he did not actually\ncause her death, he intended to kill her or another, or he\nanticipated a human life would be taken,\u201d and that \u201cthere\nwere insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant a\nsentence of life imprisonment\u201d rather than death. 449\nFed. Appx. 415, 418 (CA5 2011). The judge consequently\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimposed a sentence of death.\n   Eight days later the judge appointed new counsel to\nhandle Trevino\u2019s direct appeal. App. 1, 3. Seven months\nafter sentencing, when the trial transcript first became\navailable, that counsel filed an appeal. The Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals then considered and rejected Trevino\u2019s\nappellate claims. Trevino\u2019s appellate counsel did not\nclaim that Trevino\u2019s trial counsel had been constitutionally\nineffective during the penalty phase of the trial court pro-\nceedings. Id., at 12\u201324.\n   About six months after sentencing, the trial judge ap-\npointed Trevino a different new counsel to seek state\ncollateral relief. As Texas\u2019 procedural rules provide, that\nthird counsel initiated collateral proceedings while Tre-\nvino\u2019s appeal still was in progress. This new counsel first\nsought postconviction relief (through collateral review) in\nthe trial court itself. After a hearing, the trial court de-\nnied relief; and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\naffirmed that denial. Id., at 25\u201326, 321\u2013349. Trevino\u2019s\npostconviction claims included a claim that his trial coun-\nsel was constitutionally ineffective during the penalty\nphase of Trevino\u2019s trial, but it did not include a claim that\ntrial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness consisted in part of a failure\nadequately to investigate and to present mitigating circum-\nstances during the penalty phase of Trevino\u2019s trial. Id., at\n321\u2013349; see Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 523 (2003)\n(counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present mitigating\ncircumstances deprived defendant of effective assistance of\ncounsel).\n   Trevino then filed a petition in federal court seeking a\nwrit of habeas corpus. The Federal District Court ap-\npointed another new counsel to represent him. And that\ncounsel claimed for the first time that Trevino had not\nreceived constitutionally effective counsel during the\npenalty phase of his trial in part because of trial counsel\u2019s\nfailure to adequately investigate and present mitigating\n4                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncircumstances during the penalty phase. App. 438, 456\u2013\n478. Federal habeas counsel pointed out that Trevino\u2019s\ntrial counsel had presented only one witness at the sen-\ntencing phase, namely Trevino\u2019s aunt. The aunt had\ntestified that Trevino had had a difficult upbringing, that\nhis mother had an alcohol problem, that his family was on\nwelfare, and that he had dropped out of high school. She\nhad added that Trevino had a child, that he was good with\nchildren, and that he was not violent. Id., at 285\u2013291.\n   Federal habeas counsel then told the federal court that\nTrevino\u2019s trial counsel should have found and presented at\nthe penalty phase other mitigating matters that his own\ninvestigation had brought to light. These included, among\nother things, that Trevino\u2019s mother abused alcohol while\nshe was pregnant with Trevino, that Trevino weighed only\nfour pounds at birth, that throughout his life Trevino\nsuffered the deleterious effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,\nthat as a child Trevino had suffered numerous head inju-\nries without receiving adequate medical attention, that\nTrevino\u2019s mother had abused him physically and emotion-\nally, that from an early age Trevino was exposed to, and\nabused, alcohol and drugs, that Trevino had attended\nschool irregularly and performed poorly, and that Tre-\nvino\u2019s cognitive abilities were impaired. Id., at 66\u201367.\n   The federal court stayed proceedings to permit Trevino\nto raise this claim in state court. The state court held that\nbecause Trevino had not raised this claim during his\ninitial postconviction proceedings, he had procedurally\ndefaulted the claim, id., at 27\u201328; and the Federal District\nCourt then denied Trevino\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel claim, id., at 78\u201379. The District Court concluded\nin relevant part that, despite the fact that \u201ceven the most\nminimal investigation . . . would have revealed a wealth\nof additional mitigating evidence,\u201d an independent and\nadequate state ground (namely Trevino\u2019s failure to raise\nthe issue during his state postconviction proceeding)\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729\u2013730\n(1991).\n  Trevino appealed. The Fifth Circuit, without consider-\ning the merits of Trevino\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel claim, agreed with the District Court that an\nindependent, adequate state ground, namely Trevino\u2019s\nprocedural default, barred its consideration. 449 Fed.\nAppx., at 426.

Thaler, 687 F. 3d 222\n(2012), makes clear that the Fifth Circuit would have\nfound that Martinez would have made no difference.\n  That is because in Ibarra the Circuit recognized that\nMartinez had said that its good-cause exception applies\nwhere state law says that a criminal defendant must\ninitially raise his claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel in initial state collateral review proceedings. 687\nF. 3d, at 225\u2013226. Texas law, the Circuit pointed out, does\nnot say explicitly that the defendant must initially raise\nthe claim in state collateral review proceedings. Rather\nTexas law on its face appears to permit a criminal defend-\nant to raise such a claim on direct appeal. Id., at 227.\nAnd the Circuit held that that fact means that Martinez\ndoes not apply in Texas. 687 F. 3d, at 227. Since the\nCircuit\u2019s holding in Ibarra (that Martinez does not apply\nin Texas) would similarly govern this case, we granted\ncertiorari here to determine whether Martinez applies in\nTexas.\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  We begin with Martinez. We there recognized the his-\ntoric importance of federal habeas corpus proceedings as\na method for preventing individuals from being held in\n6                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncustody in violation of federal law. Martinez, 566 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). See generally Preiser v. Rodriguez,\n411 U. S. 475, 484\u2013485 (1973). In general, if a convicted\nstate criminal defendant can show a federal habeas court\nthat his conviction rests upon a violation of the Federal\nConstitution, he may well obtain a writ of habeas corpus\nthat requires a new trial, a new sentence, or release.\n  We similarly recognized the importance of federal ha-\nbeas corpus principles designed to prevent federal courts\nfrom interfering with a State\u2019s application of its own firmly\nestablished, consistently followed, constitutionally proper\nprocedural rules. Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n6\u20137). Those principles have long made clear that a\nconviction that rests upon a defendant\u2019s state law \u201cproce-\ndural default\u201d (for example, the defendant\u2019s failure to raise\na claim of error at the time or in the place that state law\nrequires), normally rests upon \u201can independent and ade-\nquate state ground.\u201d Coleman, 501 U. S., at 729\u2013730.\nAnd where a conviction rests upon such a ground, a fed-\neral habeas court normally cannot consider the defendant\u2019s\nfederal constitutional claim. Ibid.; see Martinez, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6\u20137).\n  At the same time, we pointed out that \u201c[t]he doctrine\nbarring procedurally defaulted claims from being heard is\nnot without exceptions. A prisoner may obtain federal\nreview of a defaulted claim by showing cause for the de-\nfault and prejudice from a violation of federal law.\u201d Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137). And we turned to the issue directly\nbefore the Court: whether Martinez had shown \u201ccause\u201d to\nexcuse his state procedural failing. Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 15).\n  Martinez argued that his lawyer should have raised, but\ndid not raise, his claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel during state collateral review proceedings. Id., at\n___ (slip op., at 4). He added that this failure, itself\namounting to ineffective assistance, was the \u201ccause\u201d of,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nand ought to excuse, his procedural default. Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 4). But this Court had previously held that\n\u201c[n]egligence on the part of a prisoner\u2019s postconviction\nattorney does not qualify as \u2018cause,\u2019 \u201d primarily because a\n\u201cprincipal\u201d such as the prisoner, \u201cbears the risk of negli-\ngent conduct on the part of his agent,\u201d the attorney. Ma-\nples v. Thomas, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Coleman, supra, at 753\u2013754; emphasis added).\nMartinez, in effect, argued for an exception to Coleman\u2019s\nbroad statement of the law.\n   We ultimately held that a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d should\n\u201cmodify the unqualified statement in Coleman that an\nattorney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction\nproceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a proce-\ndural default.\u201d Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6). We\ndid so for three reasons. First, the \u201cright to the effective\nassistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our\njustice system. . . . Indeed, the right to counsel is the\nfoundation for our adversary system.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 9).\n   Second, ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appel-\nlate review could amount to \u201ccause,\u201d excusing a defend-\nant\u2019s failure to raise (and thus procedurally defaulting) a\nconstitutional claim. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). But States\noften have good reasons for initially reviewing claims of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel during state collat-\neral proceedings rather than on direct appellate review.\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 9\u201310). That is because review of\nsuch a claim normally requires a different attorney, be-\ncause it often \u201cdepend[s] on evidence outside the trial\nrecord,\u201d and because efforts to expand the record on direct\nappeal may run afoul of \u201c[a]bbreviated deadlines,\u201d depriv-\ning the new attorney of \u201cadequate time . . . to investigate\nthe ineffective-assistance claim.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 10).\n   Third, where the State consequently channels initial\n8                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nreview of this constitutional claim to collateral proceed-\nings, a lawyer\u2019s failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-\nof-trial-counsel claim during initial-review collateral\nproceedings, could (were Coleman read broadly) deprive a\ndefendant of any review of that claim at all. Martinez,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).\n   We consequently read Coleman as containing an excep-\ntion, allowing a federal habeas court to find \u201ccause,\u201d\nthereby excusing a defendant\u2019s procedural default, where\n(1) the claim of \u201cineffective assistance of trial counsel\u201d was\na \u201csubstantial\u201d claim; (2) the \u201ccause\u201d consisted of there\nbeing \u201cno counsel\u201d or only \u201cineffective\u201d counsel during the\nstate collateral review proceeding; (3) the state collateral\nreview proceeding was the \u201cinitial\u201d review proceeding in\nrespect to the \u201cineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim\u201d; and (4) state law requires that an \u201cineffective\nassistance of trial counsel [claim] . . . be raised in an\ninitial-review collateral proceeding.\u201d Martinez, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 11, 15).\n                              B\n   Here state law differs from that in Martinez in respect\nto the fourth requirement. Unlike Arizona, Texas does not\nexpressly require the defendant to raise a claim of ineffec-\ntive assistance of trial counsel in an initial collateral\nreview proceeding. Rather Texas law on its face appears\nto permit (but not require) the defendant to raise the claim\non direct appeal. Does this difference matter?\n                              1\n  Two characteristics of the relevant Texas procedures\nlead us to conclude that it should not make a difference in\nrespect to the application of Martinez. First, Texas proce-\ndure makes it \u201cvirtually impossible for appellate counsel\nto adequately present an ineffective assistance [of trial\ncounsel] claim\u201d on direct review. Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n810\u2013811. As the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals itself\nhas pointed out, \u201cthe inherent nature of most ineffective\nassistance\u201d of trial counsel \u201cclaims\u201d means that the trial\ncourt record will often fail to \u201ccontai[n] the information\nnecessary to substantiate\u201d the claim. Ex parte Torres, 943\nS. W. 2d 469, 475 (1997) (en banc).\n   As the Court of Criminal Appeals has also noted, a\nconvicted defendant may make a motion in the trial court\nfor a new trial in order to develop the record on appeal.\nSee Reyes v. State, 849 S. W. 2d 812, 816 (1993). And, in\nprinciple, the trial court could, in connection with that\nmotion, allow the defendant some additional time to de-\nvelop a further record. Ibid. But that motion-for-new-trial\n\u201cvehicle is often inadequate because of time constraints\nand because the trial record has generally not been tran-\nscribed at this point.\u201d Torres, supra, at 475. See Tex. Rule\nApp. Proc. 21.4 (2013) (motion for a new trial must be\nmade within 30 days of sentencing); Rules 21.8(a), (c) (trial\ncourt must dispose of motion within 75 days of sentenc-\ning); Rules 35.2(b), 35.3(c) (transcript must be prepared\nwithin 120 days of sentencing where a motion for a new\ntrial is filed and this deadline may be extended). Thus, as\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals has concluded, in Texas \u201ca\nwrit of habeas corpus\u201d issued in state collateral proceed-\nings ordinarily \u201cis essential to gathering the facts neces-\nsary to . . . evaluate . . . [ineffective-assistance-of-trial-\ncounsel] claims.\u201d Torres, supra, at 475. See Robinson,\nsupra, at 810\u2013811 (noting that there is \u201cnot generally a\nrealistic opportunity to adequately develop the record for\nappeal in post-trial motions\u201d and that \u201c[t]he time require-\nments for filing and presenting a motion for new trial\nwould have made it virtually impossible for appellate\ncounsel to adequately present an ineffective assistance\nclaim to the trial court\u201d).\n   See also Thompson v. State, 9 S. W. 3d 808, 813\u2013814,\nand n. 6 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (\u201c[I]n the vast majority of\n10                  TREVINO v.

Schmolesky,\nTexas Practice Series \u00a729:76, pp. 844\u2013845 (3d ed. 2011)\n(hereinafter Texas Practice) (explaining that \u201c[o]ften\u201d the\nrequirement that a claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel be supported by a record containing direct evi-\ndence of why counsel acted as he did \u201cwill require that the\nclaim . . . be raised in postconviction habeas proceedings\nwhere a full record on the matter can be raised\u201d).\n    This opinion considers whether, as a systematic matter,\nTexas affords meaningful review of a claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel. The present capital case illus-\ntrates why it does not. The trial court appointed new\ncounsel for Trevino eight days after sentencing. Counsel\nthus had 22 days to decide whether, and on what grounds,\nto make a motion for a new trial. She then may have had\nan additional 45 days to provide support for the motion\nbut without the help of a transcript (which did not become\navailable until much later\u2014seven months after the trial).\nIt would have been difficult, perhaps impossible, within\nthat time frame to investigate Trevino\u2019s background, de-\ntermine whether trial counsel had adequately done so,\nand then develop evidence about additional mitigating\nbackground circumstances. See Reyes, supra, at 816\n(\u201c[M]otions for new trial [must] be supported by affidavit\n. . . specifically showing the truth of the grounds of\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

That\nis because Texas courts in effect have directed defendants\nto raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\non collateral, rather than on direct, review. As noted, they\nhave explained why direct review proceedings are likely\ninadequate. See supra, at 8\u201310. They have held that\nfailure to raise the claim on direct review does not bar the\ndefendant from raising the claim in collateral proceedings.\nSee, e.g., Robinson, 16 S. W. 3d, at 813; Ex parte Duffy,\n607 S. W. 2d 507, 512\u2013513 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980) (over-\nruled on other grounds by Hernandez v. State, 988 S. W.\n2d 770 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999)). They have held that the\ndefendant\u2019s decision to raise the claim on direct review\ndoes not bar the defendant from also raising the claim in\ncollateral proceedings. See, e.g., Lopez v. State, 343 S. W.\n3d 137, 143 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011); Torres, supra, at 475.\nThey have suggested that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to\nraise the claim on direct review does not constitute \u201cinef-\nfective assistance of counsel.\u201d See Sprouse v.

And Texas\u2019 highest criminal court\nhas explicitly stated that \u201c[a]s a general rule\u201d the de-\nfendant \u201cshould not raise an issue of ineffective assistance\nof counsel on direct appeal,\u201d but rather in collateral re-\nview proceedings. Mata v. State, 226 S. W. 3d 425, 430,\nn. 14 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). See Rob-\ninson, supra, at 810 (\u201c[A] post-conviction writ proceeding,\nrather than a motion for new trial, is the preferred method\nfor gathering the facts necessary to substantiate\u201d an\nineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim).\n   The criminal bar, not surprisingly, has taken this strong\njudicial advice seriously. See Guidelines and Standards\nfor Texas Capital Counsel, 69 Tex. B. J. 966, 977, Guide-\nline 12.2(B)(1)(d) (2006) (\u201c[S]tate habeas corpus is the first\n12                   TREVINO v.

App., Jan. 27, 2010) (unpublished). How could\nfederal law deny defendants the benefit of Martinez solely\nbecause of the existence of a theoretically available pro-\ncedural alternative, namely direct appellate review, that\nTexas procedures render so difficult, and in the typical\ncase all but impossible, to use successfully, and which\nTexas courts so strongly discourage defendants from\nusing?\n   Respondent argues that Texas courts enforce the rele-\nvant time limits more flexibly than we have suggested.\nSometimes, for example, an appellate court can abate an\nappeal and remand the case for further record develop-\nment in the trial court. See Cooks v. State, 240 S. W. 3d\n906 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). But the procedural possibili-\nties to which Texas now points seem special, limited in\ntheir application, and, as far as we can tell, rarely used.\nSee 43A Texas Practice \u00a750:15, at 636\u2013639; 43B id.,\n\u00a756:235, at 607\u2013609. Cooks, for example, the case upon\nwhich respondent principally relies, involved a remand for\nfurther record development, but in circumstances where\nthe lower court wrongly failed to give a defendant new\ncounsel in time to make an ordinary new trial motion. 240\nS. W. 3d, at 911. We do not believe that this, or other,\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nspecial, rarely used procedural possibilities can overcome\nthe Texas courts\u2019 own well-supported determination that\ncollateral review normally constitutes the preferred\u2014and\nindeed as a practical matter, the only\u2014method for raising\nan ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\n  Respondent further argues that there is no equitable\nproblem to be solved in Texas because if counsel fails to\nbring a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel on direct appeal, the ineffectiveness of appellate\ncounsel may constitute cause to excuse the procedural\ndefault. See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986). But\nrespondent points to no case in which such a failure by\nappellate counsel has been deemed constitutionally inef-\nfective. And that lack of authority is not surprising given\nthe fact that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\ndirected defendants to bring such claims on collateral\nreview.\n                              2\n   For the reasons just stated, we believe that the Texas\nprocedural system\u2014as a matter of its structure, design,\nand operation\u2014does not offer most defendants a meaning-\nful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel on direct appeal. What the Arizona law\nprohibited by explicit terms, Texas law precludes as a\nmatter of course. And, that being so, we can find no signif-\nicant difference between this case and Martinez. The very\nfactors that led this Court to create a narrow exception to\nColeman in Martinez similarly argue for the application of\nthat exception here.\n   The right involved\u2014adequate assistance of counsel at\ntrial\u2014is similarly and critically important. In both in-\nstances practical considerations, such as the need for a\nnew lawyer, the need to expand the trial court record, and\nthe need for sufficient time to develop the claim, argue\nstrongly for initial consideration of the claim during col-\n14                   TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlateral, rather than on direct, review. See Martinez, 566\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); see also Massaro v. United\nStates, 538 U. S. 500, 505 (2003). In both instances failure\nto consider a lawyer\u2019s \u201cineffectiveness\u201d during an initial-\nreview collateral proceeding as a potential \u201ccause\u201d for\nexcusing a procedural default will deprive the defendant\nof any opportunity at all for review of an ineffective-\nassistance-of-trial-counsel claim. See Martinez, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 7).\n   Thus, for present purposes, a distinction between (1) a\nState that denies permission to raise the claim on direct\nappeal and (2) a State that in theory grants permission\nbut, as a matter of procedural design and systemic opera-\ntion, denies a meaningful opportunity to do so is a distinc-\ntion without a difference. In saying this, we do not (any\nmore than we did in Martinez) seek to encourage States\nto tailor direct appeals so that they provide a fuller op-\nportunity to raise ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaims. That is a matter for the States to decide. And, as\nwe have said, there are often good reasons for hearing the\nclaim initially during collateral proceedings.\n                            III\n  For these reasons, we conclude that where, as here,\nstate procedural framework, by reason of its design and\noperation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that\na defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a\nclaim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct\nappeal, our holding in Martinez applies:\n     \u201c[A] procedural default will not bar a federal habeas\n     court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective\n     assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral\n     proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that\n     proceeding was ineffective.\u201d 566 U.

[or] has failed to meet the\nState\u2019s procedural requirements for presenting his federal\nclaims\u201d will not be entitled to federal habeas relief unless\nhe can show \u201ccause\u201d to excuse his default. Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722, 732, 750 (1991). There is an\n2                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nexception to that rule where \u201cfailure to consider the claims\nwill result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d ibid.;\nthat exception is not at issue here.\n   Cause comes in different forms, but the one relevant\nhere is attorney error. We recognized in Coleman that\n\u201c[w]here a [habeas] petitioner defaults a claim as a result\nof the denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel,\nthe State, which is responsible for the denial as a constitu-\ntional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting default.\u201d\nId., at 754. But we simultaneously recognized that \u201c[a]\ndifferent allocation of costs is appropriate in those circum-\nstances where the State has no responsibility to ensure\nthat the petitioner was represented by competent counsel.\u201d\nIbid. In that situation, we held, \u201cit is the petitioner who\nmust bear the burden of a failure to follow state proce-\ndural rules.\u201d Ibid. Because the error in Coleman occurred\nduring state postconviction proceedings, a point at which\nthe habeas petitioner had no constitutional right to coun-\nsel, the petitioner had to bear the cost of his default. Id.,\nat 757.\n   Last Term, in Martinez v. Ryan, we announced a \u201cnar-\nrow exception\u201d to Coleman\u2019s \u201cunqualified statement . . .\nthat an attorney\u2019s ignorance or inadvertence in a postcon-\nviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a\nprocedural default.\u201d 566 U. S. 1, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6).\nIn Martinez, Arizona law did not allow defendants to raise\nineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal;\nthey could only raise such claims in state collateral pro-\nceedings. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). We held that while\nArizona was free to structure its state court procedures in\nthis way, its \u201cdecision is not without consequences for the\nState\u2019s ability to assert a procedural default in later pro-\nceedings.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10). \u201cBy deliberately\nchoosing to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the\ndirect-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally\nguaranteed, the State significantly diminishes prisoners\u2019\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Thus, \u201cwithin the con-\ntext of this state procedural framework,\u201d attorney error\nwould qualify as cause to excuse procedural default if it\noccurred in the first proceeding at which the prisoner was\n\u201callow[ed]\u201d to raise his trial ineffectiveness claim. Id., at\n___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 13).\n   We were unusually explicit about the narrowness of our\ndecision: \u201cThe holding in this case does not concern attor-\nney errors in other kinds of proceedings,\u201d and \u201cdoes not\nextend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the\nfirst occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of\nineffective assistance at trial.\u201d Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n13\u201314). \u201cOur holding here addresses only the constitu-\ntional claims presented in this case, where the State\nbarred the defendant from raising the claims on direct\nappeal.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). In \u201call but the limited\ncircumstances recognized here,\u201d we said, \u201c[t]he rule of\nColeman governs.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n   This aggressively limiting language was not simply a\ncustomary nod to the truism that \u201cwe decide only the case\nbefore us.\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383, 396\n(1981). It was instead an important part of our explana-\ntion for why \u201c[t]his limited qualification to Coleman does\nnot implicate the usual concerns with upsetting reliance\ninterests protected by stare decisis principles.\u201d Martinez,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 12). The fact that the exception\nwas clearly delineated ensured that the Coleman rule\nwould remain administrable. And because States could\nreadily anticipate how such a sharply defined exception\nwould apply to various procedural frameworks, the excep-\ntion could be reconciled with our concerns for comity and\nequitable balancing that led to Coleman\u2019s baseline rule in\nthe first place. See Coleman, supra, at 750\u2013751. The\nStates had a clear choice, which they could make with full\nknowledge of the consequences: If a State \u201cdeliberately\ncho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the\n4                    TREVINO v. THALER\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ndirect-appeal process\u201d through a \u201cdecision to bar defendants\nfrom raising\u201d them there, then\u2014and only then\u2014would\n\u201ccounsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in an initial-review collateral\nproceeding qualif[y] as cause for a procedural default.\u201d\nMartinez, 566 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 14).\n   Today, with hardly a mention of these concerns, the\nmajority throws over the crisp limit we made so explicit\njust last Term. We announced in Martinez that the excep-\ntion applies \u201cwhere the State barred the defendant from\nraising the claims on direct appeal.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14). But today, the Court takes all the starch out of its\nrule with an assortment of adjectives, adverbs, and modi-\nfying clauses: Martinez\u2019s \u201cnarrow exception\u201d now applies\nwhenever the \u201cstate procedural framework, by reason of\nits design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a\ntypical case that a defendant will have a meaningful\nopportunity\u201d to raise his claim on direct appeal. Ante, at\n14.\n   The questions raised by this equitable equation are as\nendless as will be the state-by-state litigation it takes to\nwork them out. We are not told, for example, how mean-\ningful is meaningful enough, how meaningful-ness is to be\nmeasured, how unlikely highly unlikely is, how often a\nprocedural framework\u2019s \u201coperation\u201d must be reassessed, or\nwhat case qualifies as the \u201ctypical\u201d case. Take just this\nlast example: The case before us involved a jury trial\n(hardly typical), a capital conviction (even less typical),\nand\u2014as the majority emphasizes\u2014a particular species of\nineffectiveness claim that depends on time-consuming\ninvestigation of personal background and other mitigating\ncircumstances. Ante, at 10. Yet the majority holds it up,\napparently, as a case that is typical in the relevant sense,\nsaying that \u201c[t]he present capital case illustrates\u201d the\n\u201csystematic\u201d working of Texas\u2019s procedural framework.\nIbid.\n   Given that the standard is so opaque and malleable, the\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmajority cannot describe the exception applied here as\nnarrow, and does not do so. Gone are the repeated words\nof limitation that characterized the Martinez opinion.\nGone too is the clear choice that Martinez gave the States\nabout how to structure their criminal justice systems.\nNow, the majority offers them a gamble: If a State allows\ndefendants to bring ineffectiveness claims both on direct\nappeal and in postconviction proceedings, then a prisoner\nmight have to comply with state procedural requirements\nin order to preserve the availability of federal habeas\nreview, if a federal judge decides that the state system\ngave the defendant (or enough other \u201ctypical\u201d defendants)\na sufficiently meaningful opportunity to press his claim.\n   This invitation to litigation will, in precisely the manner\nthat Coleman foreclosed, \u201c \u2018frustrate both the States\u2019 sov-\nereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith\nattempts to honor constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 748 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128\n(1982)). In what I suspect (though cannot know) will be a\nbroad swath of cases, the Court\u2019s approach will excuse\nprocedural defaults that, under Coleman, should preclude\nfederal review. But even in cases where federal courts\nultimately decide that the habeas petitioner cannot estab-\nlish cause under the new standard, the years of procedural\nwrangling it takes to reach that decision will themselves\nundermine the finality of sentences necessary to effective\ncriminal justice. Because that approach is inconsistent\nwith Coleman, Martinez itself, and the principles of equi-\ntable discretion and comity at the heart of both, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.
