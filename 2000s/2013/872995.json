PERKINS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u2013126.      Argued February 25, 2013\u2014Decided May 28, 2013\nRodney Henderson was found stabbed to death after leaving a party in\n  Flint, Michigan, with respondent Floyd Perkins and Damarr Jones.\n  Perkins was charged with murder. Jones, the key prosecution wit-\n  ness, testified that Perkins alone committed the murder while Jones\n  looked on. Perkins, however, testified that Jones and Henderson left\n  him during the evening, and that he later saw Jones with blood on\n  his clothing. Perkins was convicted of first-degree murder and sen-\n  tenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. His convic-\n  tion became final in 1997.\n     The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA) gives a state prisoner one year to file a federal habeas peti-\n  tion, starting from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d\n  28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). But if the petition alleges newly discov-\n  ered evidence, the filing deadline is one year from \u201cthe date on which\n  the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have been discovered\n  through . . . due diligence.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\n     More than 11 years after his conviction became final, Perkins filed\n  his federal habeas petition, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance\n  of trial counsel. To overcome AEDPA\u2019s time limitations, he asserted\n  newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, relying on three affi-\n  davits, the most recent dated July 16, 2002, each pointing to Jones as\n  the murderer. The District Court found that, even if the affidavits\n  could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had\n  failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s\n  limitations period. Alternatively, the court found, Perkins had not\n  shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror\n  would have convicted him. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Acknowledg-\n  ing that Perkins\u2019 petition was untimely and that he had not diligently\n2                        MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pursued his rights, the court held that Perkins\u2019 actual-innocence\n    claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\n    claim as if it had been filed on time. In so ruling, the court apparent-\n    ly considered Perkins\u2019 delay irrelevant to appraisal of his actual-\n    innocence claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a\n petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as\n it was in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, and House v. Bell, 547 U. S.\n 518, or expiration of the AEDPA statute of limitations, as in this\n case. Pp. 7\u201314.\n       (a) Perkins, who waited nearly six years from the date of the\n 2002 affidavit to file his petition, maintains that an actual-innocence\n plea can overcome AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. This Court\u2019s\n decisions support his view. The Court has not resolved whether a\n prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding ac-\n tual-innocence claim, Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 404\u2013405, but\n it has recognized that a prisoner \u201cotherwise subject to defenses of\n abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitu-\n tional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of\n actual innocence,\u201d id., at 404.\n    The Court has applied this \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice ex-\n ception\u201d to overcome various procedural defaults, including, as most\n relevant here, failure to observe state procedural rules, such as filing\n deadlines. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750. The excep-\n tion, the Court\u2019s decisions bear out, survived AEDPA\u2019s passage. See,\n e.g., Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 558; House, 547 U. S., at\n 537\u2013538. These decisions \u201csee[k] to balance the societal interests in\n finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the\n individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.\u201d\n Schlup, 513 U. S., at 324. Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating\n an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is\n AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) The State urges that recognition of a miscarriage of justice\n exception would render \u00a72244(d)(1)(D) superfluous. That is not so,\n for AEDPA\u2019s time limitations apply to the typical case in which\n no actual-innocence claim is made, while the exception applies to\n a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows\n \u201cit is more likely than not that \u2018no reasonable juror\u2019 would have con-\n victed [the petitioner],\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329. Many petitions\n that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be\n timely or not measured by \u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s triggering provision. Nor\n does Congress\u2019 inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in\n \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) indicate an intent to preclude courts\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  from applying the exception in \u00a72244(d)(1)(D) cases. Congress did\n  not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into\n  \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2). Rather, Congress constrained the ex-\n  ception\u2019s application with respect to second-or-successive petitions\n  and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court. The more\n  rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified ver-\n  sion of the exception into other provisions of AEDPA is that, in a case\n  not governed by those provisions, the exception survived AEDPA\u2019s\n  passage intact and unrestricted. Pp. 9\u201314.\n     2. A federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway\n  claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner\u2019s part,\n  not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining\n  whether actual innocence has been reliably shown. A petitioner in-\n  voking the miscarriage of justice exception \u201cmust show that it is more\n  likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in\n  the light of the new evidence.\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 327. Unex-\n  plained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination\n  whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing. Taking ac-\n  count of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioner\u2019s actual-\n  innocence claim, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold in-\n  quiry, is tuned to the exception\u2019s underlying rationale of ensuring\n  \u201cthat federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of\n  innocent persons.\u201d Herrera, 506 U. S., at 404. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     3. Here, the District Court\u2019s appraisal of Perkins\u2019 petition as insuf-\n  ficient to meet Schlup\u2019s actual-innocence standard should be disposi-\n  tive, absent cause, which this Court does not currently see, for the\n  Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation. Under Schlup\u2019s demanding\n  standard, the gateway should open only when a petition presents \u201cev-\n  idence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in\n  the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial\n  was free of nonharmless constitutional error.\u201d 513 U.

FLOYD\n                 PERKINS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                         \n\n                                 [May 28, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n    This case concerns the \u201cactual innocence\u201d gateway to\nfederal habeas review applied in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298 (1995), and further explained in House v. Bell, 547\nU. S. 518 (2006). In those cases, a convincing showing of\nactual innocence enabled habeas petitioners to overcome\na procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their\nconstitutional claims. Here, the question arises in the\ncontext of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1), the statute of limitations\non federal habeas petitions prescribed in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Specifically,\nif the petitioner does not file her federal habeas peti-\ntion, at the latest, within one year of \u201cthe date on which\nthe factual predicate of the claim or claims presented\ncould have been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D), can the time bar be overcome by\na convincing showing that she committed no crime?\n   We hold that actual innocence, if proved, serves as a\ngateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the\nimpediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup and\nHouse, or, as in this case, expiration of the statute of\n2                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimitations. We caution, however, that tenable actual-\ninnocence gateway pleas are rare: \u201c[A] petitioner does not\nmeet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the\ndistrict court that, in light of the new evidence, no juror,\nacting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329; see\nHouse, 547 U. S., at 538 (emphasizing that the Schlup\nstandard is \u201cdemanding\u201d and seldom met). And in making\nan assessment of the kind Schlup envisioned, \u201cthe timing\nof the [petition]\u201d is a factor bearing on the \u201creliability of\nth[e] evidence\u201d purporting to show actual innocence.\nSchlup, 513 U. S., at 332.\n   In the instant case, the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that\nhabeas petitioner Perkins (respondent here) had filed his\npetition after the statute of limitations ran out, and had\n\u201cfailed to diligently pursue his rights.\u201d Order in No. 09\u2013\n1875, (CA6, Feb. 24, 2010), p. 2 (Certificate of Appealabil-\nity). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the\ndecision of the District Court denying Perkins\u2019 petition,\nand held that Perkins\u2019 actual-innocence claim allowed him\nto pursue his habeas petition as if it had been filed on\ntime. 670 F. 3d 665, 670 (2012). The appeals court ap-\nparently considered a petitioner\u2019s delay irrelevant to ap-\npraisal of an actual-innocence claim. See ibid.\n   We vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and remand\nthe case. Our opinion clarifies that a federal habeas\ncourt, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should\ncount unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner\u2019s part,\nnot as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in\ndetermining whether actual innocence has been re-\nliably shown. See Brief for Respondent 45 (habeas court\n\u201ccould . . . hold the unjustified delay against the petitioner\nwhen making credibility findings as to whether the [actual-\ninnocence] exception has been met\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   On March 4, 1993, respondent Floyd Perkins attended\na party in Flint, Michigan, in the company of his friend,\nRodney Henderson, and an acquaintance, Damarr Jones.\nThe three men left the party together. Henderson was\nlater discovered on a wooded trail, murdered by stab\nwounds to his head.\n   Perkins was charged with the murder of Henderson. At\ntrial, Jones was the key witness for the prosecution. He\ntestified that Perkins alone committed the murder while\nJones looked on. App. 55.\n   Chauncey Vaughn, a friend of Perkins and Henderson,\ntestified that, prior to the murder, Perkins had told him\nhe would kill Henderson, id., at 39, and that Perkins later\ncalled Vaughn, confessing to his commission of the crime.\nId., at 36\u201338. A third witness, Torriano Player, also a\nfriend of both Perkins and Henderson, testified that Per-\nkins told him, had he known how Player felt about Hen-\nderson, he would not have killed Henderson. Id., at 74.\n   Perkins, testifying in his own defense, offered a different\naccount of the episode. He testified that he left Hender-\nson and Jones to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store.\nWhen he exited the store, Perkins related, Jones and\nHenderson were gone. Id., at 84. Perkins said that he\nthen visited his girlfriend. Id., at 87. About an hour later,\nPerkins recalled, he saw Jones standing under a street-\nlight with blood on his pants, shoes, and plaid coat. Id.,\nat 90.\n   The jury convicted Perkins of first-degree murder. He\nwas sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of\nparole on October 27, 1993. The Michigan Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed Perkins\u2019 conviction and sentence, and the\nMichigan Supreme Court denied Perkins leave to appeal\non January 31, 1997. Perkins\u2019 conviction became final on\nMay 5, 1997.\n4                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a state prisoner\nordinarily has one year to file a federal petition for habeas\ncorpus, starting from \u201cthe date on which the judgment\nbecame final by the conclusion of direct review or the ex-\npiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). If the petition alleges newly discovered\nevidence, however, the filing deadline is one year from\n\u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\nexercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\n   Perkins filed his federal habeas corpus petition on June\n13, 2008, more than 11 years after his conviction became\nfinal. He alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance on the\npart of his trial attorney, depriving him of his Sixth\nAmendment right to competent counsel. To overcome\nAEDPA\u2019s time limitations, Perkins asserted newly discov-\nered evidence of actual innocence. He relied on three\naffidavits, each pointing to Jones, not Perkins, as Hender-\nson\u2019s murderer.\n   The first affidavit, dated January 30, 1997, was submit-\nted by Perkins\u2019 sister, Ronda Hudson. Hudson stated that\nshe had heard from a third party, Louis Ford, that Jones\nbragged about stabbing Henderson and had taken his\nclothes to the cleaners after the murder. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 54a\u201355a. The second affidavit, dated March 16,\n1999, was subscribed to by Demond Louis, Chauncey\nVaughn\u2019s younger brother. Louis stated that, on the night\nof the murder, Jones confessed to him that he had just\nkilled Henderson. Louis also described the clothes Jones\nwore that night, bloodstained orange shoes and orange\npants, and a colorful shirt. Id., at 50a\u201353a. The next day,\nLouis added, he accompanied Jones, first to a dumpster\nwhere Jones disposed of the bloodstained shoes, and then\nto the cleaners. Finally, Perkins presented the July 16,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n2002 affidavit of Linda Fleming, an employee at Pro-Clean\nCleaners in 1993. She stated that, on or about March 4,\n1993, a man matching Jones\u2019s description entered the\nshop and asked her whether bloodstains could be removed\nfrom the pants and a shirt he brought in. The pants were\norange, she recalled, and heavily stained with blood, as\nwas the multicolored shirt left for cleaning along with the\npants. Id., at 48a\u201349a.\n   The District Court found the affidavits insufficient to\nentitle Perkins to habeas relief. Characterizing the affi-\ndavits as newly discovered evidence was \u201cdubious,\u201d the\nDistrict Court observed, in light of what Perkins knew\nabout the underlying facts at the time of trial. Id., at 29a.\nBut even assuming qualification of the affidavits as evi-\ndence newly discovered, the District Court next explained,\n\u201c[Perkins\u2019] petition [was] untimely under \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\u201d\nIbid. \u201c[If] the statute of limitations began to run as of\nthe date of the latest of th[e] affidavits, July 16, 2002,\u201d the\nDistrict Court noted, then \u201cabsent tolling, [Perkins] had\nuntil July 16, 2003 in which to file his habeas petition.\u201d\nIbid. Perkins, however, did not file until nearly five years\nlater, on June 13, 2008.\n   Under Sixth Circuit precedent, the District Court stated,\n\u201ca habeas petitioner who demonstrates a credible claim\nof actual innocence based on new evidence may, in ex-\nceptional circumstances, be entitled to equitable tolling\nof habeas limitations.\u201d Id., at 30a. But Perkins had not\nestablished exceptional circumstances, the District Court\ndetermined. In any event, the District Court observed,\nequitable tolling requires diligence and Perkins \u201cha[d]\nfailed utterly to demonstrate the necessary diligence in\nexercising his rights.\u201d Id., at 31a. Alternatively, the Dis-\ntrict Court found that Perkins had failed to meet the strict\nstandard by which pleas of actual innocence are mea-\nsured: He had not shown that, taking account of all\nthe evidence, \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable\n6                 MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njuror would have convicted him,\u201d or even that the evidence\nwas new. Id., at 30a\u201331a.\n  Perkins appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment. Al-\nthough recognizing that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations\nhad expired and that Perkins had not diligently pursued\nhis rights, the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of ap-\npealability limited to a single question: Is reasonable\ndiligence a precondition to relying on actual innocence as a\ngateway to adjudication of a federal habeas petition on the\nmerits? Certificate of Appealability 2\u20133.\n  On consideration of the certified question, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court\u2019s judgment. Adhering\nto Circuit precedent, Souter v. Jones, 395 F. 3d 577, 597\u2013\n602 (2005), the Sixth Circuit held that Perkins\u2019 gateway\nactual-innocence allegations allowed him to present his\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it were filed\non time. On remand, the Court of Appeals instructed, \u201cthe\n[D]istrict [C]ourt [should] fully consider whether Perkins\nassert[ed] a credible claim of actual innocence.\u201d 670 F. 3d,\nat 676.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict on\nwhether AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations can be overcome\nby a showing of actual innocence. 568 U.

As the courts below comprehended,\nPerkins does not qualify for equitable tolling. In posses-\nsion of all three affidavits by July 2002, he waited nearly\nsix years to seek federal postconviction relief. \u201cSuch a\ndelay falls far short of demonstrating the . . . diligence\u201d\nrequired to entitle a petitioner to equitable tolling. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 31a (District Court opinion). See also Certif-\nicate of Appealability 2.\n   Perkins, however, asserts not an excuse for filing after\nthe statute of limitations has run. Instead, he maintains\nthat a plea of actual innocence can overcome AEDPA\u2019s\none-year statute of limitations. He thus seeks an equi-\ntable exception to \u00a72244(d)(1), not an extension of the time\nstatutorily prescribed. See Rivas, 687 F. 3d, at 547, n. 42\n(distinguishing from \u201cequitable tolling\u201d a plea to override\nthe statute of limitations when actual innocence is shown).\n   Decisions of this Court support Perkins\u2019 view of the\nsignificance of a convincing actual-innocence claim. We\nhave not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to\nhabeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual\ninnocence. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 404\u2013405\n(1993). We have recognized, however, that a prisoner\n\u201cotherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use\nof the writ [of habeas corpus] may have his federal consti-\ntutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a\nproper showing of actual innocence.\u201d Id., at 404 (citing\n8                  MCQUIGGIN v.

In other words, a credible showing of actual\ninnocence may allow a prisoner to pursue his constitu-\ntional claims (here, ineffective assistance of counsel) on the\nmerits notwithstanding the existence of a procedural bar\nto relief. \u201cThis rule, or fundamental miscarriage of justice\nexception, is grounded in the \u2018equitable discretion\u2019 of\nhabeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do\nnot result in the incarceration of innocent persons.\u201d Her-\nrera, 506 U.

Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n750. A federal court may invoke the miscarriage of justice\nexception to justify consideration of claims defaulted in\nstate court under state timeliness rules. See ibid. The\nState\u2019s reading of AEDPA\u2019s time prescription would thus\naccord greater force to a federal deadline than to a simi-\nlarly designed state deadline. It would be passing strange\nto interpret a statute seeking to promote federalism and\ncomity as requiring stricter enforcement of federal proce-\ndural rules than procedural rules established and enforced\nby the States.\n                             B\n  The State ties to \u00a72244(d)\u2019s text its insistence that\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations precludes courts from\nconsidering late-filed actual-innocence gateway claims.\n\u201cSection 2244(d)(1)(D),\u201d the State contends, \u201cforecloses any\nargument that a habeas petitioner has unlimited time to\npresent new evidence in support of a constitutional claim.\u201d\n10                 MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioner 17. That is so, the State maintains,\nbecause AEDPA prescribes a comprehensive system for\ndetermining when its one-year limitations period begins to\nrun. \u201cIncluded within that system,\u201d the State observes, \u201cis\na specific trigger for the precise circumstance presented\nhere: a constitutional claim based on new evidence.\u201d Ibid.\nSection 2244(d)(1)(D) runs the clock from \u201cthe date on\nwhich the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have\nbeen discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d In\nlight of that provision, the State urges, \u201cthere is no need\nfor the courts to act in equity to provide additional time for\npersons who allege actual innocence as a gateway to their\nclaims of constitutional error.\u201d Ibid. Perkins\u2019 request for\nan equitable exception to the statute of limitations, the\nState charges, would \u201crende[r] superfluous this carefully\nscripted scheme.\u201d Id., at 18.\n   The State\u2019s argument in this regard bears blinders.\nAEDPA\u2019s time limitations apply to the typical case in\nwhich no allegation of actual innocence is made. The\nmiscarriage of justice exception, we underscore, applies to\na severely confined category: cases in which new evidence\nshows \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable ju-\nror would have convicted [the petitioner].\u201d Schlup, 513\nU. S., at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section\n2244(d)(1)(D) is both modestly more stringent (because it\nrequires diligence) and dramatically less stringent (be-\ncause it requires no showing of innocence). Many petitions\nthat could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway\nwill be timely or not measured by \u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s trigger-\ning provision. That provision, in short, will hardly be\nrendered superfluous by recognition of the miscarriage of\njustice exception.\n   The State further relies on provisions of AEDPA other\nthan \u00a72244(d)(1)(D), namely, \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)\n(2), to urge that Congress knew how to incorporate the\nmiscarriage of justice exception when it was so minded.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSection 2244(b)(2)(B), the State observes, provides that\na petitioner whose first federal habeas petition has al-\nready been adjudicated when new evidence comes to light\nmay file a second-or-successive petition when, and only\nwhen, the facts underlying the new claim would \u201ces-\ntablish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for\nconstitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have\nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.\u201d\n\u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). And \u00a72254(e)(2), which generally bars\nevidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings ini-\ntiated by state prisoners, includes an exception for pris-\noners who present new evidence of their innocence. See\n\u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B) (permitting evidentiary hearings in\nfederal court if \u201cthe facts underlying the claim would be\nsufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense\u201d).\n   But Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage\nof justice exception into \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).\nRather, Congress constrained the application of the excep-\ntion. Prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment, a court could grant\nrelief on a second-or-successive petition, then known as\nan \u201cabusive\u201d petition, if the petitioner could show that \u201ca\nfundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a\nfailure to entertain the claim.\u201d McCleskey, 499 U.

Section 2244(b)(2)(B) limits the exception to cases in\nwhich \u201cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have\nbeen discovered previously through the exercise of due\ndiligence,\u201d and the petitioner can establish that no rea-\nsonable factfinder \u201cwould have found [her] guilty of the\nunderlying offense\u201d by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d\nCongress thus required second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntioners attempting to benefit from the miscarriage of\njustice exception to meet a higher level of proof (\u201cclear and\nconvincing evidence\u201d) and to satisfy a diligence require-\n12                      MCQUIGGIN v.

See\nKeeney, 504 U. S., at 12 (\u201cA habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to\ndevelop a claim in state-court proceedings will be excused\nand a hearing mandated if he can show that a fundamen-\ntal miscarriage of justice would result from failure to hold\na federal evidentiary hearing.\u201d). Under AEDPA, a peti-\ntioner seeking an evidentiary hearing must show diligence\nand, in addition, establish her actual innocence by clear\nand convincing evidence. \u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B).\n   Sections 2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) thus reflect Con-\ngress\u2019 will to modify the miscarriage of justice exception\nwith respect to second-or-successive petitions and the hold-\ning of evidentiary hearings in federal court. These pro-\nvisions do not demonstrate Congress\u2019 intent to preclude\ncourts from applying the exception, unmodified, to \u201cthe\ntype of petition at issue here\u201d\u2014an untimely first federal\nhabeas petition alleging a gateway actual-innocence claim.\nHouse, 547 U.

The text\nof \u00a72244(d)(1) contains no clear command countering the\ncourts\u2019 equitable authority to invoke the miscarriage of\njustice exception to overcome expiration of the statute of\nlimitations governing a first federal habeas petition. As\nwe observed in Holland,\n     \u201cAEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the federal ha-\n     beas review process. But AEDPA seeks to do so with-\n     out undermining basic habeas corpus principles and\n     while seeking to harmonize the new statute with prior\n     law . . . . When Congress codified new rules governing\n     this previously judicially managed area of law, it did\n     so without losing sight of the fact that the writ of ha-\n     beas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu-\n     tional rights.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citations\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Prior to AEDPA, it is true, this Court had not ruled that a credible\n\nclaim of actual innocence could supersede a federal statute of limita-\ntions. The reason why that is so is evident: Pre-AEDPA, petitions for\nfederal habeas relief were not governed by any statute of limitations.\nNotably, we said in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), that a\npetitioner who failed to comply with a timeliness requirement in state\ncourt could nevertheless plead her claims on the merits in federal court\nif she could show that \u201cfailure to consider the claims [would] result in a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id., at 750.\n14                     MCQUIGGIN v.

Even if a habeas\npetitioner asserting a credible claim of actual innocence\nmay overcome AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, the State\nargues, the Court of Appeals erred in finding that no\nthreshold diligence requirement at all applies to Perkins\u2019\npetition.\n   While formally distinct from its argument that\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s text forecloses a late-filed claim alleging\nactual innocence, the State\u2019s contention makes scant\nsense. Section 2244(d)(1)(D) requires a habeas petitioner\nto file a claim within one year of the time in which new\nevidence \u201ccould have been discovered through the exercise\nof due diligence.\u201d It would be bizarre to hold that a habeas\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For eight pages, the dissent stridently insists that federal (although\n\nnot state) statutes of limitations allow no exceptions not contained in\nthe text. Well, not quite so, the dissent ultimately acknowledges. Post,\nat 8. Even AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, the dissent admits, is\nsubject to equitable tolling. But that is because equitable tolling \u201ccan\nbe seen as a reasonable assumption of genuine legislative intent.\u201d Post,\nat 9. Why is it not an equally reasonable assumption that Congress\nwould want a limitations period to yield when what is at stake is a\nState\u2019s incarceration of an individual for a crime, it has become clear,\nno reasonable person would find he committed? For all its bluster,\nthe dissent agrees with the Court on a crucial point: Congress legis-\nlates against the backdrop of existing law. Post, at 10. At the time\nof AEDPA\u2019s enactment, multiple decisions of this Court applied the\nmiscarriage of justice exception to overcome various threshold barriers\nto relief. See supra, at 7\u20139.

To invoke\nthe miscarriage of justice exception to AEDPA\u2019s statute of\nlimitations, we repeat, a petitioner \u201cmust show that it is\nmore likely than not that no reasonable juror would have\nconvicted him in the light of the new evidence.\u201d Schlup,\n513 U.

The timing of such a petition,\nhowever, should seriously undermine the credibility of the\nactual-innocence claim. Moreover, the deceased witness\u2019\nprior testimony, which would have been subject to cross-\nexamination, could be introduced in the event of a new\ntrial. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.

The District Court\nproceeded properly in first determining that Perkins\u2019\nclaim was filed well beyond AEDPA\u2019s limitations period\nand that equitable tolling was unavailable to Perkins\nbecause he could demonstrate neither exceptional circum-\nstances nor diligence. See supra, at 5.

On remand, the District Court\u2019s appraisal of\nPerkins\u2019 petition as insufficient to meet Schlup\u2019s actual-\ninnocence standard should be dispositive, absent cause,\nwhich we do not currently see, for the Sixth Circuit to\nupset that evaluation.

S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1).\nThe gaping hole in today\u2019s opinion for the Court is its\nfailure to answer the crucial question upon which all else\ndepends: What is the source of the Court\u2019s power to fash-\nion what it concedes is an \u201cexception\u201d to this clear statu-\ntory command?\n   That question is unanswered because there is no an-\nswer. This Court has no such power, and not one of the\ncases cited by the opinion says otherwise. The Constitu-\ntion vests legislative power only in Congress, which never\nenacted the exception the Court creates today. That in-\nconvenient truth resolves this case.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  \u201cActual innocence\u201d has, until today, been an exception\nonly to judge-made, prudential barriers to habeas relief, or\nas a means of channeling judges\u2019 statutorily conferred\ndiscretion not to apply a procedural bar. Never before\n2                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave we applied the exception to circumvent a categorical\nstatutory bar to relief. We have not done so because we\nhave no power to do so. Where Congress has erected a\nconstitutionally valid barrier to habeas relief, a court\ncannot decline to give it effect.\n   Before AEDPA, the Supreme Court had developed an\narray of doctrines, see, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.\n72, 87 (1977) (procedural default); McCleskey v. Zant, 499\nU. S. 467, 489 (1991) (abuse of the writ), to limit the ha-\nbeas practice that it had radically expanded in the early or\nmid-20th century to include review of the merits of convic-\ntion and not merely jurisdiction of the convicting court, see\nStone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 475\u2013478 (1976) (citing\nFrank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915)); Brown v. Allen,\n344 U. S. 443, 533\u2013534 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in\nresult); Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal\nHabeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441,\n483\u2013499 (1963). For example, the doctrine of procedural\ndefault holds that a state prisoner\u2019s default of his federal\nclaims \u201cin state court pursuant to an independent and\nadequate state procedural rule\u201d bars federal habeas re-\nview of those claims. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 750 (1991). That doctrine is not a statutory or ju-\nrisdictional command; rather, it is a \u201cprudential\u201d rule\n\u201cgrounded in \u2018considerations of comity and concerns for the\norderly administration of criminal justice.\u2019 \u201d Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 392\u2013393 (2004) (quoting Francis v.\nHenderson, 425 U. S. 536, 538\u2013539 (1976)).\n   And what courts have created, courts can modify. One\njudge-made exception to procedural default allows a peti-\ntioner to proceed where he can demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d for the\ndefault and \u201cprejudice.\u201d See Coleman, supra, at 750. As\nrelevant here, we have also expressed a willingness to\nexcuse a petitioner\u2019s default, even absent a showing of\ncause, \u201cwhere a constitutional violation has probably\nresulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Bell, 547\nU. S. 518, 536\u2013537 (2006).\n  There is nothing inherently inappropriate (as opposed to\nmerely unwise) about judge-created exceptions to judge-\nmade barriers to relief. Procedural default, for example,\nraises \u201cno question of a federal district court\u2019s power to\nentertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d\nFrancis, supra, at 538. Where a petitioner would, but for\na judge-made doctrine like procedural default, have a good\nhabeas claim, it offends no command of Congress\u2019s for a\nfederal court to consider the petition. But that free-and-\neasy approach has no place where a statutory bar to habeas\nrelief is at issue. \u201c[T]he power to award the writ by any\nof the courts of the United States, must be given by writ-\nten law,\u201d Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Mar-\nshall, C. J.), and \u201cjudgments about the proper scope of\nthe writ are \u2018normally for Congress to make,\u2019 \u201d Felker v.\nTurpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996) (quoting Lonchar v.\nThomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996)). One would have\nthought it too obvious to mention that this Court is duty\nbound to enforce AEDPA, not amend it.\n                             B\n   Because we have no \u201cequitable\u201d power to discard statu-\ntory barriers to habeas relief, we cannot simply extend\njudge-made exceptions to judge-made barriers into the\nstatutory realm. The Court\u2019s insupportable leap from\njudge-made procedural bars to all procedural bars, includ-\ning statutory bars, does all the work in its opinion\u2014and\nthere is not a whit of precedential support for it. McCles-\nkey v. Zant applied a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception to\nthe judge-made abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. 499 U. S., at\n487\u2013489, 495. Coleman v. Thompson and Murray v. Car-\nrier applied it to the judge-made procedural-default doc-\ntrine. 501 U. S., at 750; 477 U. S., at 496. Keeney v.\n4                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nTamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992), applied it to a variant of\nprocedural default: a state prisoner\u2019s failure adequately to\ndevelop material facts in state court. Id., at 8. Kuhlmann\nv. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986), a plurality opinion, ap-\nplied it to a statute that merely said lower federal courts\n\u201cneed not\u201d entertain successive petitions, thus leaving\nthem with \u201cdiscretion to entertain successive petitions\nunder some circumstances.\u201d Id., at 449, 451 (emphasis\nadded). Not one of the cases on which the Court relies\ntoday supports the extraordinary premise that courts can\ncreate out of whole cloth an exception to a statutory bar to\nrelief.\n   The opinion for the Court also trots out post-AEDPA\ncases to prove the irrelevant point that \u201c[t]he miscarriage\nof justice exception . . . survived AEDPA\u2019s passage.\u201d Ante,\nat 8. What it ignores, yet again, is that after AEDPA\u2019s\npassage, as before, the exception applied only to nonstatu-\ntory obstacles to relief. Bousley v. United States and\nHouse v. Bell were applications of the judge-made doctrine\nof procedural default. See Bousley, 523 U. S. 614, 623\n(1998); id., at 625 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (\u201cI agree with the Court\u2019s central hold-\ning . . . that none of its judge-made rules foreclose peti-\ntioner\u2019s collateral attack . . .\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at\n630 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); House, 547 U.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlimitations.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 2. Its explanation for this lack\nof precedent is that before AEDPA, \u201cpetitions for federal\nhabeas relief were not governed by any statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Ibid. That is true but utterly unprobative. There\nare many statutory bars to relief other than statutes of\nlimitations, and we had never (and before today, have\nnever) created an actual-innocence exception to any of\nthem. The reason why is obvious: Judicially amending a\nvalidly enacted statute in this way is a flagrant breach of\nthe separation of powers.\n                              II\n   The Court has no qualms about transgressing such a\nbasic principle. It does not even attempt to cloak its act of\njudicial legislation in the pretense that it is merely con-\nstruing the statute; indeed, it freely admits that its opin-\nion recognizes an \u201cexception\u201d that the statute does not\ncontain. Ante, at 7. And it dismisses, with a series of\ntransparent non sequiturs, Michigan\u2019s overwhelming\ntextual argument that the statute provides no such excep-\ntion and envisions none.\n   The key textual point is that two provisions of \u00a72244,\nworking in tandem, provide a comprehensive path to relief\nfor an innocent prisoner who has newly discovered evi-\ndence that supports his constitutional claim. Section\n2244(d)(1)(D) gives him a fresh year in which to file, start-\ning on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the\nclaim or claims presented could have been discovered\nthrough the exercise of due diligence,\u201d while \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)\nlifts the bar on second or successive petitions. Congress\nclearly anticipated the scenario of a habeas petitioner with\na credible innocence claim and addressed it by crafting an\nexception (and an exception, by the way, more restrictive\nthan the one that pleases the Court today). One cannot\nassume that Congress left room for other, judge-made\napplications of the actual-innocence exception, any more\n6                     MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthan one would add another gear to a Swiss watch on the\ntheory that the watchmaker surely would have included it\nif he had thought of it. In both cases, the intricate crafts-\nmanship tells us that the designer arranged things just as\nhe wanted them.\n   The Court\u2019s feeble rejoinder is that its (judicially in-\nvented) version of the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception applies\nonly to a \u201cseverely confined category\u201d of cases. Ante, at 10.\nSince cases qualifying for the actual-innocence exception\nwill be rare, it explains, the statutory path for innocent\npetitioners will not \u201cbe rendered superfluous.\u201d Ibid. That\nis no answer at all. That the Court\u2019s exception would not\nentirely frustrate Congress\u2019s design does not weaken the\nforce of the State\u2019s argument that Congress addressed\nthe issue comprehensively and chose to exclude dilatory\nprisoners like respondent. By the Court\u2019s logic, a statute\nbanning littering could simply be deemed to contain an\nexception for cigarette butts; after all, the statute as thus\namended would still cover something. That is not how a\ncourt respectful of the separation of powers should inter-\npret statutes.\n   Even more bizarre is the Court\u2019s concern that applying\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations without recognizing an\natextual actual-innocence exception would \u201caccord greater\nforce to a federal deadline than to a similarly designed\nstate deadline.\u201d Ante, at 9; see also ante, at 13, n. 2. The\nCourt terms that outcome \u201cpassing strange,\u201d ante, at 9,\nbut it is not strange at all. Only federal statutes of limita-\ntions bind federal habeas courts with the force of law;\na state statute of limitations is given effect on federal\nhabeas review only by virtue of the judge-made doctrine of\nprocedural default.1 See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730\u2013731.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 If the Court is really troubled by this disparity, there is a way to\n\nresolve it that is consistent with the separation of powers: Revise our\njudge-made procedural-default doctrine to give absolute preclusive\n                       Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)      7\n\n                            SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWith its eye firmly fixed on something it likes\u2014a shiny\nnew exception to a statute unloved in the best circles\u2014the\nCourt overlooks this basic distinction, which would not\ntrouble a second-year law student armed with a copy of\nHart & Wechsler. The Court simply ignores basic legal\nprinciples where they pose an obstacle to its policy-driven,\nfree-form improvisation.\n   The Court\u2019s statutory-construction blooper reel does\nnot end there. Congress\u2019s express inclusion of innocence-\nbased exceptions in two neighboring provisions of the Act\nconfirms, one would think, that there is no actual-\ninnocence exception to \u00a72244(d)(1). Section 2244(b)(2)(B),\nas already noted, lifts the bar on claims presented in\nsecond or successive petitions where \u201cthe factual predicate\nfor the claim could not have been discovered previously\nthrough . . . due diligence\u201d and \u201cthe facts underlying the\nclaim . . . would be sufficient to establish by clear and\nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no\nreasonable factfinder would have found\u201d the petitioner\nguilty. Section 2254(e)(2) permits a district court to hold\nan evidentiary hearing where a diligent state prisoner\u2019s\nclaim relies on new facts that \u201cwould be sufficient to estab-\nlish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitu-\ntional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found\u201d\nhim guilty. Ordinarily, we would draw from the express\nenumeration of these two actual-innocence exceptions the\ninference that no others were intended.\n   The Court\u2019s twisting path to the contrary conclusion is\nnot easy to follow, but I will try. In the Court\u2019s view, the\nkey fact here is that these two provisions of AEDPA codi-\nfied what had previously been judge-made barriers to\nrelief and applied to them a stricter actual-innocence\nstandard than the courts had been applying. See ante, at\n11\u201312. From this, the Court reasons that Congress made\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\neffect to state statutes of limitations. \n\n8                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\na conscious choice not also to apply the more restrictive\nactual-innocence standard to the statute of limitations.\nErgo, the Court concludes, we are free to apply the more\nlenient version of the actual-innocence exception. Ante, at\n12\u201313.     That clever account ignores the background\nagainst which Congress legislated. Of course Congress did\nnot \u201cconstrain\u201d application of the actual-innocence excep-\ntion to the statute of limitations. It felt no need to do so,\nbecause it had no reason whatsoever to suspect that any\nversion of the exception would apply to the statute of\nlimitations. The collective efforts of respondent and the\nmajority have turned up not a single instance where this\nCourt has applied the actual-innocence exception to any\nstatutory barrier to habeas relief, much less to a statute of\nlimitations. See Part I\u2013B, supra. What has been said\nof equitable tolling applies in spades to non-tolling judi-\ncial inventions: \u201cCongress cannot intend to incorporate, by\nsilence, various forms of equitable tolling that were not\ngenerally recognized in the common law at the time of\nenactment.\u201d Bain & Colella, Interpreting Federal Statutes\nof Limitations, 37 Creighton L. Rev. 493, 503 (2004).\nThe only conceivable relevance of \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and\n2254(e)(2) is (1) as we have said, that no other actual-\ninnocence exception was intended, and (2) that if Congress\nhad anticipated that this Court would amend \u00a72244(d)(1)\nto add an actual-innocence exception (which it surely did\nnot), it would have desired the more stringent formulation\nand not the expansive formulation applied today, which it\nspecifically rejected for those other provisions.\n                              III\n  Three years ago, in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___\n(2010), we held that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is\nsubject to equitable tolling. That holding offers no support\nfor importing a novel actual-innocence exception.

By contrast, suspending the\nstatute because of a separate policy that the court believes\nshould trump it (\u201cactual innocence\u201d) is a blatant over-\nruling. Moreover, the doctrine of equitable tolling is cen-\nturies old, and dates from a time when the separation of\nthe legislative and judicial powers was incomplete. See,\ne.g., Bree v. Holbech, 2 Doug. 655, 656 (1781) (Mansfield, J.);\nSouth-Sea Co. v. Wymondsell, 24 E. R. 1004, 3 P. Wms.\n143, 144 (1732); Booth v. Warrington, 2 E. R. 111, 112\u2013\n113, 4 Bro. P.

Conoway, 4 Yeates 109 (Pa. 1804). As Profes-\nsor Manning has explained, until the Glorious Revolution\nof 1688, the Crown retained \u201cpretensions to independent\nlegislative authority, and English judges continued to\nserve as the Crown\u2019s agents, in theory and practice a\ncomponent of the executive. Given these conditions, which\ndistinguish the old English from the American constitu-\ntional context, it is not surprising to find a similarly indis-\ntinct line between appropriate legislative and judicial\nfunctions in matters of interpretation.\u201d Manning, Textual-\nism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1,\n36\u201337 (2001) (footnote omitted). Thus, the doctrine of the\nequity of the statute, of which equitable tolling was an\nexample, was reflected in Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries\n\u201ctwo-thirds of the way through the eighteenth century.\u201d\nManning, supra, at 52.\n   American courts\u2019 later adoption of the English equitable-\ntolling practice need not be regarded as a violation of the\nseparation of powers, but can be seen as a reasonable\n10                    MCQUIGGIN v.

Colonial legisla-\ntures would have assumed that equitable tolling would\nattend any statute of limitations they adopted. In any\ncase, equitable tolling surely represents such a reasonable\nassumption today. \u201cIt is hornbook law that limitations\nperiods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless\ntolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant\nstatute. Congress must be presumed to draft limitations\nperiods in light of this background principle.\u201d Young v.\nUnited States, 535 U.

The majority and dissenting opinions in Holland\ndisputed whether that presumption had been overcome,\nbut all agreed that the presumption existed and was a\nlegitimate tool for construing statutes of limitations.

PERKINS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u2013126.      Argued February 25, 2013\u2014Decided May 28, 2013\nRodney Henderson was found stabbed to death after leaving a party in\n  Flint, Michigan, with respondent Floyd Perkins and Damarr Jones.\n  Perkins was charged with murder. Jones, the key prosecution wit-\n  ness, testified that Perkins alone committed the murder while Jones\n  looked on. Perkins, however, testified that Jones and Henderson left\n  him during the evening, and that he later saw Jones with blood on\n  his clothing. Perkins was convicted of first-degree murder and sen-\n  tenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. His convic-\n  tion became final in 1997.\n     The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n  (AEDPA) gives a state prisoner one year to file a federal habeas peti-\n  tion, starting from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d\n  28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A). But if the petition alleges newly discov-\n  ered evidence, the filing deadline is one year from \u201cthe date on which\n  the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have been discovered\n  through . . . due diligence.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\n     More than 11 years after his conviction became final, Perkins filed\n  his federal habeas petition, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance\n  of trial counsel. To overcome AEDPA\u2019s time limitations, he asserted\n  newly discovered evidence of actual innocence, relying on three affi-\n  davits, the most recent dated July 16, 2002, each pointing to Jones as\n  the murderer. The District Court found that, even if the affidavits\n  could be characterized as evidence newly discovered, Perkins had\n  failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s\n  limitations period. Alternatively, the court found, Perkins had not\n  shown that, taking account of all the evidence, no reasonable juror\n  would have convicted him. The Sixth Circuit reversed. Acknowledg-\n  ing that Perkins\u2019 petition was untimely and that he had not diligently\n2                        MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    pursued his rights, the court held that Perkins\u2019 actual-innocence\n    claim allowed him to present his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\n    claim as if it had been filed on time. In so ruling, the court apparent-\n    ly considered Perkins\u2019 delay irrelevant to appraisal of his actual-\n    innocence claim.\nHeld:\n    1. Actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a\n petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as\n it was in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298, and House v. Bell, 547 U. S.\n 518, or expiration of the AEDPA statute of limitations, as in this\n case. Pp. 7\u201314.\n       (a) Perkins, who waited nearly six years from the date of the\n 2002 affidavit to file his petition, maintains that an actual-innocence\n plea can overcome AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. This Court\u2019s\n decisions support his view. The Court has not resolved whether a\n prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding ac-\n tual-innocence claim, Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 404\u2013405, but\n it has recognized that a prisoner \u201cotherwise subject to defenses of\n abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitu-\n tional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of\n actual innocence,\u201d id., at 404.\n    The Court has applied this \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice ex-\n ception\u201d to overcome various procedural defaults, including, as most\n relevant here, failure to observe state procedural rules, such as filing\n deadlines. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 750. The excep-\n tion, the Court\u2019s decisions bear out, survived AEDPA\u2019s passage. See,\n e.g., Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 558; House, 547 U. S., at\n 537\u2013538. These decisions \u201csee[k] to balance the societal interests in\n finality, comity, and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the\n individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.\u201d\n Schlup, 513 U. S., at 324. Sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating\n an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is\n AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. Pp. 7\u20139.\n       (b) The State urges that recognition of a miscarriage of justice\n exception would render \u00a72244(d)(1)(D) superfluous. That is not so,\n for AEDPA\u2019s time limitations apply to the typical case in which\n no actual-innocence claim is made, while the exception applies to\n a severely confined category: cases in which new evidence shows\n \u201cit is more likely than not that \u2018no reasonable juror\u2019 would have con-\n victed [the petitioner],\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329. Many petitions\n that could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway will be\n timely or not measured by \u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s triggering provision. Nor\n does Congress\u2019 inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in\n \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) indicate an intent to preclude courts\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  from applying the exception in \u00a72244(d)(1)(D) cases. Congress did\n  not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into\n  \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2). Rather, Congress constrained the ex-\n  ception\u2019s application with respect to second-or-successive petitions\n  and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court. The more\n  rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified ver-\n  sion of the exception into other provisions of AEDPA is that, in a case\n  not governed by those provisions, the exception survived AEDPA\u2019s\n  passage intact and unrestricted. Pp. 9\u201314.\n     2. A federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway\n  claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner\u2019s part,\n  not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining\n  whether actual innocence has been reliably shown. A petitioner in-\n  voking the miscarriage of justice exception \u201cmust show that it is more\n  likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in\n  the light of the new evidence.\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 327. Unex-\n  plained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination\n  whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing. Taking ac-\n  count of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioner\u2019s actual-\n  innocence claim, rather than treating timeliness as a threshold in-\n  quiry, is tuned to the exception\u2019s underlying rationale of ensuring\n  \u201cthat federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of\n  innocent persons.\u201d Herrera, 506 U. S., at 404. Pp. 14\u201316.\n     3. Here, the District Court\u2019s appraisal of Perkins\u2019 petition as insuf-\n  ficient to meet Schlup\u2019s actual-innocence standard should be disposi-\n  tive, absent cause, which this Court does not currently see, for the\n  Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation. Under Schlup\u2019s demanding\n  standard, the gateway should open only when a petition presents \u201cev-\n  idence of innocence so strong that a court cannot have confidence in\n  the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial\n  was free of nonharmless constitutional error.\u201d 513 U.

FLOYD\n                 PERKINS\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                         \n\n                                 [May 28, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n    This case concerns the \u201cactual innocence\u201d gateway to\nfederal habeas review applied in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S.\n298 (1995), and further explained in House v. Bell, 547\nU. S. 518 (2006). In those cases, a convincing showing of\nactual innocence enabled habeas petitioners to overcome\na procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their\nconstitutional claims. Here, the question arises in the\ncontext of 28 U. S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1), the statute of limitations\non federal habeas petitions prescribed in the Antiterrorism\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Specifically,\nif the petitioner does not file her federal habeas peti-\ntion, at the latest, within one year of \u201cthe date on which\nthe factual predicate of the claim or claims presented\ncould have been discovered through the exercise of due\ndiligence,\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D), can the time bar be overcome by\na convincing showing that she committed no crime?\n   We hold that actual innocence, if proved, serves as a\ngateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the\nimpediment is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup and\nHouse, or, as in this case, expiration of the statute of\n2                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlimitations. We caution, however, that tenable actual-\ninnocence gateway pleas are rare: \u201c[A] petitioner does not\nmeet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the\ndistrict court that, in light of the new evidence, no juror,\nacting reasonably, would have voted to find him guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Schlup, 513 U. S., at 329; see\nHouse, 547 U. S., at 538 (emphasizing that the Schlup\nstandard is \u201cdemanding\u201d and seldom met). And in making\nan assessment of the kind Schlup envisioned, \u201cthe timing\nof the [petition]\u201d is a factor bearing on the \u201creliability of\nth[e] evidence\u201d purporting to show actual innocence.\nSchlup, 513 U. S., at 332.\n   In the instant case, the Sixth Circuit acknowledged that\nhabeas petitioner Perkins (respondent here) had filed his\npetition after the statute of limitations ran out, and had\n\u201cfailed to diligently pursue his rights.\u201d Order in No. 09\u2013\n1875, (CA6, Feb. 24, 2010), p. 2 (Certificate of Appealabil-\nity). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reversed the\ndecision of the District Court denying Perkins\u2019 petition,\nand held that Perkins\u2019 actual-innocence claim allowed him\nto pursue his habeas petition as if it had been filed on\ntime. 670 F. 3d 665, 670 (2012). The appeals court ap-\nparently considered a petitioner\u2019s delay irrelevant to ap-\npraisal of an actual-innocence claim. See ibid.\n   We vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and remand\nthe case. Our opinion clarifies that a federal habeas\ncourt, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should\ncount unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner\u2019s part,\nnot as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in\ndetermining whether actual innocence has been re-\nliably shown. See Brief for Respondent 45 (habeas court\n\u201ccould . . . hold the unjustified delay against the petitioner\nwhen making credibility findings as to whether the [actual-\ninnocence] exception has been met\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Henderson was\nlater discovered on a wooded trail, murdered by stab\nwounds to his head.\n   Perkins was charged with the murder of Henderson. At\ntrial, Jones was the key witness for the prosecution. He\ntestified that Perkins alone committed the murder while\nJones looked on. App. 55.\n   Chauncey Vaughn, a friend of Perkins and Henderson,\ntestified that, prior to the murder, Perkins had told him\nhe would kill Henderson, id., at 39, and that Perkins later\ncalled Vaughn, confessing to his commission of the crime.\nId., at 36\u201338. A third witness, Torriano Player, also a\nfriend of both Perkins and Henderson, testified that Per-\nkins told him, had he known how Player felt about Hen-\nderson, he would not have killed Henderson. Id., at 74.\n   Perkins, testifying in his own defense, offered a different\naccount of the episode. He testified that he left Hender-\nson and Jones to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store.\nWhen he exited the store, Perkins related, Jones and\nHenderson were gone. Id., at 84. Perkins said that he\nthen visited his girlfriend. Id., at 87. About an hour later,\nPerkins recalled, he saw Jones standing under a street-\nlight with blood on his pants, shoes, and plaid coat. Id.,\nat 90.\n   The jury convicted Perkins of first-degree murder. He\nwas sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of\nparole on October 27, 1993. The Michigan Court of Ap-\npeals affirmed Perkins\u2019 conviction and sentence, and the\nMichigan Supreme Court denied Perkins leave to appeal\non January 31, 1997. Perkins\u2019 conviction became final on\nMay 5, 1997.\n4                  MCQUIGGIN v.

S. C.\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(A). If the petition alleges newly discovered\nevidence, however, the filing deadline is one year from\n\u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or\nclaims presented could have been discovered through the\nexercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\n   Perkins filed his federal habeas corpus petition on June\n13, 2008, more than 11 years after his conviction became\nfinal. He alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance on the\npart of his trial attorney, depriving him of his Sixth\nAmendment right to competent counsel. To overcome\nAEDPA\u2019s time limitations, Perkins asserted newly discov-\nered evidence of actual innocence. He relied on three\naffidavits, each pointing to Jones, not Perkins, as Hender-\nson\u2019s murderer.\n   The first affidavit, dated January 30, 1997, was submit-\nted by Perkins\u2019 sister, Ronda Hudson. Hudson stated that\nshe had heard from a third party, Louis Ford, that Jones\nbragged about stabbing Henderson and had taken his\nclothes to the cleaners after the murder. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 54a\u201355a. The second affidavit, dated March 16,\n1999, was subscribed to by Demond Louis, Chauncey\nVaughn\u2019s younger brother. Louis stated that, on the night\nof the murder, Jones confessed to him that he had just\nkilled Henderson. Louis also described the clothes Jones\nwore that night, bloodstained orange shoes and orange\npants, and a colorful shirt. Id., at 50a\u201353a. The next day,\nLouis added, he accompanied Jones, first to a dumpster\nwhere Jones disposed of the bloodstained shoes, and then\nto the cleaners. Finally, Perkins presented the July 16,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n2002 affidavit of Linda Fleming, an employee at Pro-Clean\nCleaners in 1993. She stated that, on or about March 4,\n1993, a man matching Jones\u2019s description entered the\nshop and asked her whether bloodstains could be removed\nfrom the pants and a shirt he brought in. The pants were\norange, she recalled, and heavily stained with blood, as\nwas the multicolored shirt left for cleaning along with the\npants. Id., at 48a\u201349a.\n   The District Court found the affidavits insufficient to\nentitle Perkins to habeas relief. Characterizing the affi-\ndavits as newly discovered evidence was \u201cdubious,\u201d the\nDistrict Court observed, in light of what Perkins knew\nabout the underlying facts at the time of trial. Id., at 29a.\nBut even assuming qualification of the affidavits as evi-\ndence newly discovered, the District Court next explained,\n\u201c[Perkins\u2019] petition [was] untimely under \u00a72244(d)(1)(D).\u201d\nIbid. \u201c[If] the statute of limitations began to run as of\nthe date of the latest of th[e] affidavits, July 16, 2002,\u201d the\nDistrict Court noted, then \u201cabsent tolling, [Perkins] had\nuntil July 16, 2003 in which to file his habeas petition.\u201d\nIbid. Perkins, however, did not file until nearly five years\nlater, on June 13, 2008.\n   Under Sixth Circuit precedent, the District Court stated,\n\u201ca habeas petitioner who demonstrates a credible claim\nof actual innocence based on new evidence may, in ex-\nceptional circumstances, be entitled to equitable tolling\nof habeas limitations.\u201d Id., at 30a. But Perkins had not\nestablished exceptional circumstances, the District Court\ndetermined. In any event, the District Court observed,\nequitable tolling requires diligence and Perkins \u201cha[d]\nfailed utterly to demonstrate the necessary diligence in\nexercising his rights.\u201d Id., at 31a. Alternatively, the Dis-\ntrict Court found that Perkins had failed to meet the strict\nstandard by which pleas of actual innocence are mea-\nsured: He had not shown that, taking account of all\nthe evidence, \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable\n6                 MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njuror would have convicted him,\u201d or even that the evidence\nwas new. Id., at 30a\u201331a.\n  Perkins appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment. Al-\nthough recognizing that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations\nhad expired and that Perkins had not diligently pursued\nhis rights, the Sixth Circuit granted a certificate of ap-\npealability limited to a single question: Is reasonable\ndiligence a precondition to relying on actual innocence as a\ngateway to adjudication of a federal habeas petition on the\nmerits? Certificate of Appealability 2\u20133.\n  On consideration of the certified question, the Court of\nAppeals reversed the District Court\u2019s judgment. Adhering\nto Circuit precedent, Souter v. Jones, 395 F. 3d 577, 597\u2013\n602 (2005), the Sixth Circuit held that Perkins\u2019 gateway\nactual-innocence allegations allowed him to present his\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as if it were filed\non time. On remand, the Court of Appeals instructed, \u201cthe\n[D]istrict [C]ourt [should] fully consider whether Perkins\nassert[ed] a credible claim of actual innocence.\u201d 670 F. 3d,\nat 676.\n  We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict on\nwhether AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations can be overcome\nby a showing of actual innocence. 568 U.

As the courts below comprehended,\nPerkins does not qualify for equitable tolling. In posses-\nsion of all three affidavits by July 2002, he waited nearly\nsix years to seek federal postconviction relief. \u201cSuch a\ndelay falls far short of demonstrating the . . . diligence\u201d\nrequired to entitle a petitioner to equitable tolling. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 31a (District Court opinion). See also Certif-\nicate of Appealability 2.\n   Perkins, however, asserts not an excuse for filing after\nthe statute of limitations has run. Instead, he maintains\nthat a plea of actual innocence can overcome AEDPA\u2019s\none-year statute of limitations. He thus seeks an equi-\ntable exception to \u00a72244(d)(1), not an extension of the time\nstatutorily prescribed. See Rivas, 687 F. 3d, at 547, n. 42\n(distinguishing from \u201cequitable tolling\u201d a plea to override\nthe statute of limitations when actual innocence is shown).\n   Decisions of this Court support Perkins\u2019 view of the\nsignificance of a convincing actual-innocence claim.

We have recognized, however, that a prisoner\n\u201cotherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use\nof the writ [of habeas corpus] may have his federal consti-\ntutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a\nproper showing of actual innocence.\u201d Id., at 404 (citing\n8                  MCQUIGGIN v.

In other words, a credible showing of actual\ninnocence may allow a prisoner to pursue his constitu-\ntional claims (here, ineffective assistance of counsel) on the\nmerits notwithstanding the existence of a procedural bar\nto relief. \u201cThis rule, or fundamental miscarriage of justice\nexception, is grounded in the \u2018equitable discretion\u2019 of\nhabeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do\nnot result in the incarceration of innocent persons.\u201d Her-\nrera, 506 U.

Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n750. A federal court may invoke the miscarriage of justice\nexception to justify consideration of claims defaulted in\nstate court under state timeliness rules. See ibid. The\nState\u2019s reading of AEDPA\u2019s time prescription would thus\naccord greater force to a federal deadline than to a simi-\nlarly designed state deadline. It would be passing strange\nto interpret a statute seeking to promote federalism and\ncomity as requiring stricter enforcement of federal proce-\ndural rules than procedural rules established and enforced\nby the States.\n                             B\n  The State ties to \u00a72244(d)\u2019s text its insistence that\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations precludes courts from\nconsidering late-filed actual-innocence gateway claims.\n\u201cSection 2244(d)(1)(D),\u201d the State contends, \u201cforecloses any\nargument that a habeas petitioner has unlimited time to\npresent new evidence in support of a constitutional claim.\u201d\n10                 MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioner 17. That is so, the State maintains,\nbecause AEDPA prescribes a comprehensive system for\ndetermining when its one-year limitations period begins to\nrun. \u201cIncluded within that system,\u201d the State observes, \u201cis\na specific trigger for the precise circumstance presented\nhere: a constitutional claim based on new evidence.\u201d Ibid.\nSection 2244(d)(1)(D) runs the clock from \u201cthe date on\nwhich the factual predicate of the claim . . . could have\nbeen discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d In\nlight of that provision, the State urges, \u201cthere is no need\nfor the courts to act in equity to provide additional time for\npersons who allege actual innocence as a gateway to their\nclaims of constitutional error.\u201d Ibid. Perkins\u2019 request for\nan equitable exception to the statute of limitations, the\nState charges, would \u201crende[r] superfluous this carefully\nscripted scheme.\u201d Id., at 18.\n   The State\u2019s argument in this regard bears blinders.\nAEDPA\u2019s time limitations apply to the typical case in\nwhich no allegation of actual innocence is made. The\nmiscarriage of justice exception, we underscore, applies to\na severely confined category: cases in which new evidence\nshows \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable ju-\nror would have convicted [the petitioner].\u201d Schlup, 513\nU. S., at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section\n2244(d)(1)(D) is both modestly more stringent (because it\nrequires diligence) and dramatically less stringent (be-\ncause it requires no showing of innocence). Many petitions\nthat could not pass through the actual-innocence gateway\nwill be timely or not measured by \u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s trigger-\ning provision. That provision, in short, will hardly be\nrendered superfluous by recognition of the miscarriage of\njustice exception.\n   The State further relies on provisions of AEDPA other\nthan \u00a72244(d)(1)(D), namely, \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)\n(2), to urge that Congress knew how to incorporate the\nmiscarriage of justice exception when it was so minded.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

And \u00a72254(e)(2), which generally bars\nevidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings ini-\ntiated by state prisoners, includes an exception for pris-\noners who present new evidence of their innocence. See\n\u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B) (permitting evidentiary hearings in\nfederal court if \u201cthe facts underlying the claim would be\nsufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense\u201d).\n   But Congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage\nof justice exception into \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2).\nRather, Congress constrained the application of the excep-\ntion. Prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment, a court could grant\nrelief on a second-or-successive petition, then known as\nan \u201cabusive\u201d petition, if the petitioner could show that \u201ca\nfundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a\nfailure to entertain the claim.\u201d McCleskey, 499 U.

Section 2244(b)(2)(B) limits the exception to cases in\nwhich \u201cthe factual predicate for the claim could not have\nbeen discovered previously through the exercise of due\ndiligence,\u201d and the petitioner can establish that no rea-\nsonable factfinder \u201cwould have found [her] guilty of the\nunderlying offense\u201d by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d\nCongress thus required second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntioners attempting to benefit from the miscarriage of\njustice exception to meet a higher level of proof (\u201cclear and\nconvincing evidence\u201d) and to satisfy a diligence require-\n12                      MCQUIGGIN v.

See\nKeeney, 504 U.

Under AEDPA, a peti-\ntioner seeking an evidentiary hearing must show diligence\nand, in addition, establish her actual innocence by clear\nand convincing evidence. \u00a7\u00a72254(e)(2)(A)(ii), (B).\n   Sections 2244(b)(2)(B) and 2254(e)(2) thus reflect Con-\ngress\u2019 will to modify the miscarriage of justice exception\nwith respect to second-or-successive petitions and the hold-\ning of evidentiary hearings in federal court.

The text\nof \u00a72244(d)(1) contains no clear command countering the\ncourts\u2019 equitable authority to invoke the miscarriage of\njustice exception to overcome expiration of the statute of\nlimitations governing a first federal habeas petition. As\nwe observed in Holland,\n     \u201cAEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the federal ha-\n     beas review process. But AEDPA seeks to do so with-\n     out undermining basic habeas corpus principles and\n     while seeking to harmonize the new statute with prior\n     law . . . . When Congress codified new rules governing\n     this previously judicially managed area of law, it did\n     so without losing sight of the fact that the writ of ha-\n     beas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitu-\n     tional rights.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16) (citations\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Prior to AEDPA, it is true, this Court had not ruled that a credible\n\nclaim of actual innocence could supersede a federal statute of limita-\ntions. The reason why that is so is evident: Pre-AEDPA, petitions for\nfederal habeas relief were not governed by any statute of limitations.\nNotably, we said in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), that a\npetitioner who failed to comply with a timeliness requirement in state\ncourt could nevertheless plead her claims on the merits in federal court\nif she could show that \u201cfailure to consider the claims [would] result in a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id., at 750.\n14                     MCQUIGGIN v.

Even if a habeas\npetitioner asserting a credible claim of actual innocence\nmay overcome AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, the State\nargues, the Court of Appeals erred in finding that no\nthreshold diligence requirement at all applies to Perkins\u2019\npetition.\n   While formally distinct from its argument that\n\u00a72244(d)(1)(D)\u2019s text forecloses a late-filed claim alleging\nactual innocence, the State\u2019s contention makes scant\nsense. Section 2244(d)(1)(D) requires a habeas petitioner\nto file a claim within one year of the time in which new\nevidence \u201ccould have been discovered through the exercise\nof due diligence.\u201d It would be bizarre to hold that a habeas\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 For eight pages, the dissent stridently insists that federal (although\n\nnot state) statutes of limitations allow no exceptions not contained in\nthe text. Well, not quite so, the dissent ultimately acknowledges. Post,\nat 8. Even AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, the dissent admits, is\nsubject to equitable tolling. But that is because equitable tolling \u201ccan\nbe seen as a reasonable assumption of genuine legislative intent.\u201d Post,\nat 9. Why is it not an equally reasonable assumption that Congress\nwould want a limitations period to yield when what is at stake is a\nState\u2019s incarceration of an individual for a crime, it has become clear,\nno reasonable person would find he committed? For all its bluster,\nthe dissent agrees with the Court on a crucial point: Congress legis-\nlates against the backdrop of existing law. Post, at 10. At the time\nof AEDPA\u2019s enactment, multiple decisions of this Court applied the\nmiscarriage of justice exception to overcome various threshold barriers\nto relief. See supra, at 7\u20139.

S. C. \u00a72244(d)(1).\nThe gaping hole in today\u2019s opinion for the Court is its\nfailure to answer the crucial question upon which all else\ndepends: What is the source of the Court\u2019s power to fash-\nion what it concedes is an \u201cexception\u201d to this clear statu-\ntory command?\n   That question is unanswered because there is no an-\nswer. This Court has no such power, and not one of the\ncases cited by the opinion says otherwise. The Constitu-\ntion vests legislative power only in Congress, which never\nenacted the exception the Court creates today. That in-\nconvenient truth resolves this case.\n                            I\n\n                            A\n\n  \u201cActual innocence\u201d has, until today, been an exception\nonly to judge-made, prudential barriers to habeas relief, or\nas a means of channeling judges\u2019 statutorily conferred\ndiscretion not to apply a procedural bar. Never before\n2                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nhave we applied the exception to circumvent a categorical\nstatutory bar to relief. We have not done so because we\nhave no power to do so. Where Congress has erected a\nconstitutionally valid barrier to habeas relief, a court\ncannot decline to give it effect.\n   Before AEDPA, the Supreme Court had developed an\narray of doctrines, see, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S.\n72, 87 (1977) (procedural default); McCleskey v. Zant, 499\nU. S. 467, 489 (1991) (abuse of the writ), to limit the ha-\nbeas practice that it had radically expanded in the early or\nmid-20th century to include review of the merits of convic-\ntion and not merely jurisdiction of the convicting court, see\nStone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 475\u2013478 (1976) (citing\nFrank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915)); Brown v. Allen,\n344 U. S. 443, 533\u2013534 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in\nresult); Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal\nHabeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441,\n483\u2013499 (1963). For example, the doctrine of procedural\ndefault holds that a state prisoner\u2019s default of his federal\nclaims \u201cin state court pursuant to an independent and\nadequate state procedural rule\u201d bars federal habeas re-\nview of those claims. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.\n722, 750 (1991). That doctrine is not a statutory or ju-\nrisdictional command; rather, it is a \u201cprudential\u201d rule\n\u201cgrounded in \u2018considerations of comity and concerns for the\norderly administration of criminal justice.\u2019 \u201d Dretke v.\nHaley, 541 U. S. 386, 392\u2013393 (2004) (quoting Francis v.\nHenderson, 425 U. S. 536, 538\u2013539 (1976)).\n   And what courts have created, courts can modify. One\njudge-made exception to procedural default allows a peti-\ntioner to proceed where he can demonstrate \u201ccause\u201d for the\ndefault and \u201cprejudice.\u201d See Coleman, supra, at 750. As\nrelevant here, we have also expressed a willingness to\nexcuse a petitioner\u2019s default, even absent a showing of\ncause, \u201cwhere a constitutional violation has probably\nresulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Bell, 547\nU. S. 518, 536\u2013537 (2006).\n  There is nothing inherently inappropriate (as opposed to\nmerely unwise) about judge-created exceptions to judge-\nmade barriers to relief. Procedural default, for example,\nraises \u201cno question of a federal district court\u2019s power to\nentertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d\nFrancis, supra, at 538. Where a petitioner would, but for\na judge-made doctrine like procedural default, have a good\nhabeas claim, it offends no command of Congress\u2019s for a\nfederal court to consider the petition. But that free-and-\neasy approach has no place where a statutory bar to habeas\nrelief is at issue. \u201c[T]he power to award the writ by any\nof the courts of the United States, must be given by writ-\nten law,\u201d Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807) (Mar-\nshall, C. J.), and \u201cjudgments about the proper scope of\nthe writ are \u2018normally for Congress to make,\u2019 \u201d Felker v.\nTurpin, 518 U. S. 651, 664 (1996) (quoting Lonchar v.\nThomas, 517 U. S. 314, 323 (1996)). One would have\nthought it too obvious to mention that this Court is duty\nbound to enforce AEDPA, not amend it.\n                             B\n   Because we have no \u201cequitable\u201d power to discard statu-\ntory barriers to habeas relief, we cannot simply extend\njudge-made exceptions to judge-made barriers into the\nstatutory realm. The Court\u2019s insupportable leap from\njudge-made procedural bars to all procedural bars, includ-\ning statutory bars, does all the work in its opinion\u2014and\nthere is not a whit of precedential support for it. McCles-\nkey v. Zant applied a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d exception to\nthe judge-made abuse-of-the-writ doctrine. 499 U. S., at\n487\u2013489, 495. Coleman v. Thompson and Murray v. Car-\nrier applied it to the judge-made procedural-default doc-\ntrine. 501 U. S., at 750; 477 U. S., at 496. Keeney v.\n4                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nTamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992), applied it to a variant of\nprocedural default: a state prisoner\u2019s failure adequately to\ndevelop material facts in state court. Id., at 8. Kuhlmann\nv. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986), a plurality opinion, ap-\nplied it to a statute that merely said lower federal courts\n\u201cneed not\u201d entertain successive petitions, thus leaving\nthem with \u201cdiscretion to entertain successive petitions\nunder some circumstances.\u201d Id., at 449, 451 (emphasis\nadded). Not one of the cases on which the Court relies\ntoday supports the extraordinary premise that courts can\ncreate out of whole cloth an exception to a statutory bar to\nrelief.\n   The opinion for the Court also trots out post-AEDPA\ncases to prove the irrelevant point that \u201c[t]he miscarriage\nof justice exception . . . survived AEDPA\u2019s passage.\u201d Ante,\nat 8. What it ignores, yet again, is that after AEDPA\u2019s\npassage, as before, the exception applied only to nonstatu-\ntory obstacles to relief. Bousley v. United States and\nHouse v. Bell were applications of the judge-made doctrine\nof procedural default. See Bousley, 523 U. S. 614, 623\n(1998); id., at 625 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (\u201cI agree with the Court\u2019s central hold-\ning . . . that none of its judge-made rules foreclose peti-\ntioner\u2019s collateral attack . . .\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at\n630 (SCALIA, J., dissenting); House, 547 U. S., at 522.\nCalderon v. Thompson, 523 U.

S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlimitations.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 2. Its explanation for this lack\nof precedent is that before AEDPA, \u201cpetitions for federal\nhabeas relief were not governed by any statute of limita-\ntions.\u201d Ibid. That is true but utterly unprobative. There\nare many statutory bars to relief other than statutes of\nlimitations, and we had never (and before today, have\nnever) created an actual-innocence exception to any of\nthem. The reason why is obvious: Judicially amending a\nvalidly enacted statute in this way is a flagrant breach of\nthe separation of powers.\n                              II\n   The Court has no qualms about transgressing such a\nbasic principle. It does not even attempt to cloak its act of\njudicial legislation in the pretense that it is merely con-\nstruing the statute; indeed, it freely admits that its opin-\nion recognizes an \u201cexception\u201d that the statute does not\ncontain. Ante, at 7. And it dismisses, with a series of\ntransparent non sequiturs, Michigan\u2019s overwhelming\ntextual argument that the statute provides no such excep-\ntion and envisions none.\n   The key textual point is that two provisions of \u00a72244,\nworking in tandem, provide a comprehensive path to relief\nfor an innocent prisoner who has newly discovered evi-\ndence that supports his constitutional claim. Section\n2244(d)(1)(D) gives him a fresh year in which to file, start-\ning on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the\nclaim or claims presented could have been discovered\nthrough the exercise of due diligence,\u201d while \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)\nlifts the bar on second or successive petitions. Congress\nclearly anticipated the scenario of a habeas petitioner with\na credible innocence claim and addressed it by crafting an\nexception (and an exception, by the way, more restrictive\nthan the one that pleases the Court today). One cannot\nassume that Congress left room for other, judge-made\napplications of the actual-innocence exception, any more\n6                     MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthan one would add another gear to a Swiss watch on the\ntheory that the watchmaker surely would have included it\nif he had thought of it. In both cases, the intricate crafts-\nmanship tells us that the designer arranged things just as\nhe wanted them.\n   The Court\u2019s feeble rejoinder is that its (judicially in-\nvented) version of the \u201cactual innocence\u201d exception applies\nonly to a \u201cseverely confined category\u201d of cases. Ante, at 10.\nSince cases qualifying for the actual-innocence exception\nwill be rare, it explains, the statutory path for innocent\npetitioners will not \u201cbe rendered superfluous.\u201d Ibid. That\nis no answer at all. That the Court\u2019s exception would not\nentirely frustrate Congress\u2019s design does not weaken the\nforce of the State\u2019s argument that Congress addressed\nthe issue comprehensively and chose to exclude dilatory\nprisoners like respondent. By the Court\u2019s logic, a statute\nbanning littering could simply be deemed to contain an\nexception for cigarette butts; after all, the statute as thus\namended would still cover something. That is not how a\ncourt respectful of the separation of powers should inter-\npret statutes.\n   Even more bizarre is the Court\u2019s concern that applying\nAEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations without recognizing an\natextual actual-innocence exception would \u201caccord greater\nforce to a federal deadline than to a similarly designed\nstate deadline.\u201d Ante, at 9; see also ante, at 13, n. 2. The\nCourt terms that outcome \u201cpassing strange,\u201d ante, at 9,\nbut it is not strange at all. Only federal statutes of limita-\ntions bind federal habeas courts with the force of law;\na state statute of limitations is given effect on federal\nhabeas review only by virtue of the judge-made doctrine of\nprocedural default.1 See Coleman, 501 U. S., at 730\u2013731.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 If the Court is really troubled by this disparity, there is a way to\n\nresolve it that is consistent with the separation of powers: Revise our\njudge-made procedural-default doctrine to give absolute preclusive\n                       Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)      7\n\n                            SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWith its eye firmly fixed on something it likes\u2014a shiny\nnew exception to a statute unloved in the best circles\u2014the\nCourt overlooks this basic distinction, which would not\ntrouble a second-year law student armed with a copy of\nHart & Wechsler. The Court simply ignores basic legal\nprinciples where they pose an obstacle to its policy-driven,\nfree-form improvisation.\n   The Court\u2019s statutory-construction blooper reel does\nnot end there. Congress\u2019s express inclusion of innocence-\nbased exceptions in two neighboring provisions of the Act\nconfirms, one would think, that there is no actual-\ninnocence exception to \u00a72244(d)(1). Section 2244(b)(2)(B),\nas already noted, lifts the bar on claims presented in\nsecond or successive petitions where \u201cthe factual predicate\nfor the claim could not have been discovered previously\nthrough . . . due diligence\u201d and \u201cthe facts underlying the\nclaim . . . would be sufficient to establish by clear and\nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no\nreasonable factfinder would have found\u201d the petitioner\nguilty. Section 2254(e)(2) permits a district court to hold\nan evidentiary hearing where a diligent state prisoner\u2019s\nclaim relies on new facts that \u201cwould be sufficient to estab-\nlish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitu-\ntional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found\u201d\nhim guilty. Ordinarily, we would draw from the express\nenumeration of these two actual-innocence exceptions the\ninference that no others were intended.\n   The Court\u2019s twisting path to the contrary conclusion is\nnot easy to follow, but I will try. In the Court\u2019s view, the\nkey fact here is that these two provisions of AEDPA codi-\nfied what had previously been judge-made barriers to\nrelief and applied to them a stricter actual-innocence\nstandard than the courts had been applying. See ante, at\n11\u201312. From this, the Court reasons that Congress made\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\neffect to state statutes of limitations. \n\n8                  MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\na conscious choice not also to apply the more restrictive\nactual-innocence standard to the statute of limitations.\nErgo, the Court concludes, we are free to apply the more\nlenient version of the actual-innocence exception. Ante, at\n12\u201313.     That clever account ignores the background\nagainst which Congress legislated. Of course Congress did\nnot \u201cconstrain\u201d application of the actual-innocence excep-\ntion to the statute of limitations. It felt no need to do so,\nbecause it had no reason whatsoever to suspect that any\nversion of the exception would apply to the statute of\nlimitations. The collective efforts of respondent and the\nmajority have turned up not a single instance where this\nCourt has applied the actual-innocence exception to any\nstatutory barrier to habeas relief, much less to a statute of\nlimitations. See Part I\u2013B, supra. What has been said\nof equitable tolling applies in spades to non-tolling judi-\ncial inventions: \u201cCongress cannot intend to incorporate, by\nsilence, various forms of equitable tolling that were not\ngenerally recognized in the common law at the time of\nenactment.\u201d Bain & Colella, Interpreting Federal Statutes\nof Limitations, 37 Creighton L. Rev. 493, 503 (2004).\nThe only conceivable relevance of \u00a7\u00a72244(b)(2)(B) and\n2254(e)(2) is (1) as we have said, that no other actual-\ninnocence exception was intended, and (2) that if Congress\nhad anticipated that this Court would amend \u00a72244(d)(1)\nto add an actual-innocence exception (which it surely did\nnot), it would have desired the more stringent formulation\nand not the expansive formulation applied today, which it\nspecifically rejected for those other provisions.\n                              III\n  Three years ago, in Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___\n(2010), we held that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is\nsubject to equitable tolling. That holding offers no support\nfor importing a novel actual-innocence exception.

By contrast, suspending the\nstatute because of a separate policy that the court believes\nshould trump it (\u201cactual innocence\u201d) is a blatant over-\nruling. Moreover, the doctrine of equitable tolling is cen-\nturies old, and dates from a time when the separation of\nthe legislative and judicial powers was incomplete. See,\ne.g., Bree v.

As Profes-\nsor Manning has explained, until the Glorious Revolution\nof 1688, the Crown retained \u201cpretensions to independent\nlegislative authority, and English judges continued to\nserve as the Crown\u2019s agents, in theory and practice a\ncomponent of the executive. Given these conditions, which\ndistinguish the old English from the American constitu-\ntional context, it is not surprising to find a similarly indis-\ntinct line between appropriate legislative and judicial\nfunctions in matters of interpretation.\u201d Manning, Textual-\nism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum.

Congress, being well aware of\nthe longstanding background presumption of equitable\ntolling, \u201cmay provide otherwise if it wishes to do so.\u201d\nIrwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 96\n(1990). The majority and dissenting opinions in Holland\ndisputed whether that presumption had been overcome,\nbut all agreed that the presumption existed and was a\nlegitimate tool for construing statutes of limitations. See\nHolland, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); id., at ___\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).\n   Here, by contrast, the Court has ambushed Congress\nwith an utterly unprecedented (and thus unforeseeable)\nmaneuver. Congressional silence, \u201cwhile permitting an\ninference that Congress intended to apply ordinary back-\nground\u201d principles, \u201ccannot show that it intended to apply\nan unusual modification of those rules.\u201d Meyer v. Holley,\n537 U. S. 280, 286 (2003).2 Because there is no plausible\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 The Court concedes that \u201cCongress legislates against the backdrop\n\nof existing law,\u201d but protests that \u201c[a]t the time of AEDPA\u2019s enactment,\nmultiple decisions of this Court applied the miscarriage of justice\nexception to overcome various threshold barriers to relief.\u201d Ante, at 14,\nn. 3. That is right, of course, but only at an uninformative level of\ngenerality; the relevant inquiry is, to which barriers had we applied the\nexception? Whistling past the graveyard, the Court refuses to engage\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)     11\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nbasis for inferring that Congress intended or could have\nanticipated this exception, its adoption here amounts to a\npure judicial override of the statute Congress enacted. \u201cIt\nis wrong for us to reshape\u201d AEDPA \u201con the very lathe of\njudge-made habeas jurisprudence it was designed to re-\npair.\u201d Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U. S. 637, 647\n(1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n                         *    *    *\n   \u201cIt would be marvellously inspiring to be able to boast\nthat we have a criminal-justice system in which a claim of\n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 will always be heard, no matter how late\nit is brought forward, and no matter how much the failure\nto bring it forward at the proper time is the defendant\u2019s\nown fault.\u201d Bousley, 523 U. S., at 635 (SCALIA, J., dissent-\ning). I suspect it is this vision of perfect justice through\nabundant procedure that impels the Court today. Of\ncourse, \u201cwe do not have such a system, and no society\nunwilling to devote unlimited resources to repetitive crim-\ninal litigation ever could.\u201d Ibid. Until today, a district\ncourt could dismiss an untimely petition without delving\ninto the underlying facts. From now on, each time an\nuntimely petitioner claims innocence\u2014and how many\nprisoners asking to be let out of jail do not?\u2014the district\ncourt will be obligated to expend limited judicial resources\nwading into the murky merits of the petitioner\u2019s innocence\nclaim. The Court notes \u201cthat tenable actual-innocence\ngateway pleas are rare.\u201d Ante, at 2. That discouraging\nreality, intended as reassurance, is in truth \u201cthe condem-\nnation of the procedure which has encouraged frivolous\ncases.\u201d Brown, 344 U. S., at 537 (Jackson, J., concurring\nin result).\n   It has now been 60 years since Brown v. Allen, in which\nwe struck the Faustian bargain that traded the simple\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nwith this question.\n12                 MCQUIGGIN v. PERKINS\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nelegance of the common-law writ of habeas corpus for\nfederal-court power to probe the substantive merits of\nstate-court convictions. Even after AEDPA\u2019s pass through\nthe Augean stables, no one in a position to observe the\nfunctioning of our byzantine federal-habeas system can\nbelieve it an efficient device for separating the truly de-\nserving from the multitude of prisoners pressing false\nclaims. \u201c[F]loods of stale, frivolous and repetitious peti-\ntions inundate the docket of the lower courts and swell our\nown. . . . It must prejudice the occasional meritorious\napplicant to be buried in a flood of worthless ones.\u201d Id., at\n536\u2013537.\n   The \u201cinundation\u201d that Justice Jackson lamented in 1953\n\u201cconsisted of 541\u201d federal habeas petitions filed by state\nprisoners. Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral\nAttack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142,\n143 (1970). By 1969, that number had grown to 7,359.\nIbid. In the year ending on September 30, 2012, 15,929\nsuch petitions were filed. Administrative Office of the\nUnited States Courts, Judicial Business of the United\nStates Courts 3 (Sept. 30, 2012) (Table C\u20132). Today\u2019s deci-\nsion piles yet more dead weight onto a postconviction\nhabeas system already creaking at its rusted joints.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
