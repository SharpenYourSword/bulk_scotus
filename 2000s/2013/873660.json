MARETTA\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA\n\n       No. 11\u20131221. Argued April 22, 2013\u2014Decided June 3, 2013\nThe Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA)\n  establishes an insurance program for federal employees. FEGLIA\n  permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds,\n  and specifies an \u201corder of precedence\u201d providing that an employee\u2019s\n  death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential\n  recipients. 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a). A Virginia statute revokes a benefi-\n  ciary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a\n  former spouse where there has been a change in the decedent\u2019s mari-\n  tal status. Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A) (Section A). In the event that\n  this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of\n  Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the for-\n  mer spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the par-\n  ty who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.\n  \u00a720\u2013111.1(D).\n    Warren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as\n  the beneficiary of his Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance\n  (FEGLI) policy. After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline\n  Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary. After\n  Warren\u2019s death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for\n  the FEGLI proceeds and collected them. Hillman sued in Virginia\n  court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D. Maretta ar-\n  gued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law. The\n  parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted. The Virginia Circuit\n  Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the\n  FEGLI policy proceeds. The State Supreme Court reversed, conclud-\n  ing that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with\n  the purposes and objectives of Congress.\nHeld: Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.\n Pp. 6\u201315.\n2                        HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n       (a) State law is pre-empted \u201cto the extent of any conflict with a\n    federal statute.\u201d Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S.\n    363, 372. This case raises the question whether Virginia law \u201cstands\n    as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full pur-\n    poses and objectives of Congress.\u201d Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,\n    67. Pp. 6\u201313.\n         (1) To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress\u2019\n    purposes and objectives, the nature of the federal interest must first\n    be ascertained. Crosby, 530 U. S., at 372\u2013373. Two previous cases\n    govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and\n    FEGLIA here. In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655, a California\n    court granted a decedent\u2019s widow, who was not the named beneficiary\n    of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of\n    1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community\n    property under state law. This Court reversed. Because NSLIA pro-\n    vided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and\n    could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that\n    Congress had \u201cspoken with force and clarity in directing that the pro-\n    ceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\u201d Id., at 658. The\n    Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Service-\n    men\u2019s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v.\n    Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46. There, a Maine court imposed a constructive\n    trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemember\u2019s widow, the\n    named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedent\u2019s\n    first wife as required by a divorce decree. Holding the constructive\n    trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner con-\n    trolled and that SGLIA made clear that \u201cthe insured service member\n    possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter\n    that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to\n    the proper office.\u201d Id., at 56. Pp. 7\u20139.\n         (2) The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal\n    force here. NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA,\n    which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insured\u2019s\n    designated beneficiary, \u00a78705(a), and which underscores that the\n    employee\u2019s \u201cright\u201d of designation \u201ccannot be waived or restricted,\u201d 5\n    CFR \u00a7843.205(e). Section D interferes with this scheme, because it\n    directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the\n    named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by\n    a third party. FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure\n    for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and\n    evinces Congress\u2019 decision to accord federal employees an unfettered\n    freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the pro-\n    ceeds actually belong to that beneficiary. This conclusion is con-\n    firmed by another provision of FEGLIA, \u00a78705(e), which creates a\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

If States\n  could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure\n  Congress established, \u00a78705(e)\u2019s narrow exception would be trans-\n  formed into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n    (b) Hillman\u2019s additional arguments in support of a different result\n  are unpersuasive.

S. C. \u00a78701 et seq., establishes a life\ninsurance program for federal employees. FEGLIA pro-\nvides that an employee may designate a beneficiary to\nreceive the proceeds of his life insurance at the time of his\ndeath. \u00a78705(a). Separately, a Virginia statute addresses\nthe situation in which an employee\u2019s marital status has\nchanged, but he did not update his beneficiary designation\nbefore his death. Section 20\u2013111.1(D) of the Virginia Code\nrenders a former spouse liable for insurance proceeds to\nwhoever would have received them under applicable law,\nusually a widow or widower, but for the beneficiary desig-\nnation. Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) (Lexis Supp. 2012).\nThis case presents the question whether the remedy cre-\nated by \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) is pre-empted by FEGLIA and its\nimplementing regulations. We hold that it is.\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n * JUSTICE SCALIA joins all but footnote 4 of this opinion.\n2                  HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In 1954, Congress enacted FEGLIA to \u201cprovide low-cost\ngroup life insurance to Federal employees.\u201d H. R. Rep. No.\n2579, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1954). The program is ad-\nministered by the federal Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM). 5 U. S. C. \u00a78716. Pursuant to the authority\ngranted to it by FEGLIA, OPM entered into a life insur-\nance contract with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Com-\npany. See \u00a78709; 5 CFR \u00a7870.102 (2013). Individual\nemployees enrolled in the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life\nInsurance (FEGLI) Program receive coverage through this\ncontract. The program is of substantial size. In 2010, the\ntotal amount of FEGLI insurance coverage in force was\n$824 billion. GAO, Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insur-\nance: Retirement Benefit and Retained Asset Account\nDisclosures Could Be Improved 1 (GAO\u201312\u201394, 2011).\n   FEGLIA provides that, upon an employee\u2019s death, life\ninsurance benefits are paid in accordance with a specified\n\u201corder of precedence.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a). The proceeds\naccrue \u201c[f]irst, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries desig-\nnated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing\nreceived before death.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[I]f there is no designated\nbeneficiary,\u201d the benefits are paid \u201cto the widow or widower\nof the employee.\u201d Ibid. Absent a widow or widower, the\nbenefits accrue to \u201cthe child or children of the employee\nand descendants of [the] deceased children\u201d; \u201cthe parents\nof the employee\u201d or their survivors; the \u201cexecutor or ad-\nministrator of the estate of the employee\u201d; and last, to\n\u201cother next of kin.\u201d Ibid.\n   To be effective, the beneficiary designation and any\naccompanying revisions to it must be in writing and duly\nfiled with the Government. See ibid. (\u201c[A] designation,\nchange, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other\ndocument not so executed and filed has no force or effect\u201d).\nAn OPM regulation provides that an employee may\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cchange [a] beneficiary at any time without the knowledge\nor consent of the previous beneficiary,\u201d and makes clear\nthat \u201c[t]his right cannot be waived or restricted.\u201d 5 CFR\n\u00a7870.802(f). Employees are informed of these require-\nments through materials that OPM disseminates in\nconnection with the program. See, e.g., OPM, FEGLI Pro-\ngram Booklet 21\u201322 (rev. Aug. 2004) (setting forth the\norder of precedence and stating that OPM \u201cwill pay bene-\nfits\u201d \u201c[f]irst, to the beneficiary [the employee] desig-\nnate[s]\u201d). The order of precedence is also described on the\nform that employees use to designate a beneficiary. See\nDesignation of Beneficiary, FEGLI Program, SF 2823 (rev.\nMar. 2011) (Back of Part 2). And the enrollment form\nadvises employees to update their designations if their\n\u201c[i]ntentions [c]hange\u201d as a result of, for example, \u201cmar-\nriage [or] divorce.\u201d Ibid.\n   In 1998, Congress amended FEGLIA to create a limited\nexception to an employee\u2019s right of designation. The stat-\nute now provides that \u201c[a]ny amount which would other-\nwise be paid to a person determined under the order of\nprecedence . . . shall be paid (in whole or in part) by [OPM]\nto another person if and to the extent expressly provided\nfor in the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment,\nor legal separation\u201d or related settlement, but only in the\nevent the \u201cdecree, order, or agreement\u201d is received by\nOPM or the employing agency before the employee\u2019s\ndeath. 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a78705(e)(1)\u2013(2).\n   FEGLIA also includes an express pre-emption provision.\nThat provision states in relevant part that \u201c[t]he provi-\nsions of any contract under [FEGLIA] which relate to the\nnature or extent of coverage or benefits (including pay-\nments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and\npreempt any law of any State . . . , which relates to group\nlife insurance to the extent that the law or regulation is\ninconsistent with the contractual provisions.\u201d \u00a78709(d)(1).\n   This case turns on the interaction between these provi-\n4                  HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsions of FEGLIA and a Virginia statute. Section 20\u2013\n111.1(A) (Section A) of the Virginia Code provides that a\ndivorce or annulment \u201crevoke[s]\u201d a \u201cbeneficiary designa-\ntion contained in a then existing written contract owned\nby one party that provides for the payment of any death\nbenefit to the other party.\u201d A \u201cdeath benefit\u201d includes\n\u201cpayments under a life insurance contract.\u201d \u00a720.111.1(B).\n   In the event that Section A is pre-empted by federal law,\n\u00a720\u2013111.1(D) (Section D) of the Virginia Code applies.\nSection D provides as follows:\n      \u201cIf [Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1] is preempted by fed-\n    eral law with respect to the payment of any death\n    benefit, a former spouse who, not for value, receives\n    the payment of any death benefit that the former\n    spouse is not entitled to under [\u00a720\u2013111.1] is person-\n    ally liable for the amount of the payment to the per-\n    son who would have been entitled to it were\n    [\u00a720.111.1] not preempted.\u201d\nIn other words, where Section A is pre-empted, Section D\ncreates a cause of action rendering a former spouse liable\nfor the principal amount of the insurance proceeds to the\nperson who would have received them had Section A\ncontinued in effect.\n                             B\n   Warren Hillman (Warren) and respondent Judy Maretta\nwere married. In 1996, Warren named Maretta as the\nbeneficiary of his FEGLI policy. Warren and Maretta\ndivorced in 1998 and, four years later, he married peti-\ntioner Jacqueline Hillman. Warren died unexpectedly in\n2008. Because Warren had never changed the named\nbeneficiary under his FEGLI policy, it continued to iden-\ntify Maretta as the beneficiary at the time of his death\ndespite his divorce and subsequent remarriage to Hillman.\n   Hillman filed a claim for the proceeds of Warren\u2019s life\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninsurance, but the FEGLI administrator informed her that\nthe proceeds would accrue to Maretta, because she had\nbeen named as the beneficiary. Maretta filed a claim for\nthe benefits with OPM and collected the FEGLI proceeds\nin the amount of $124,558.03. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.\n   Hillman then filed a lawsuit in Virginia Circuit Court,\narguing that Maretta was liable to her under Section D for\nthe proceeds of her deceased husband\u2019s FEGLI policy. The\nparties agreed that Section A, which directly reallo-\ncates the benefits, is pre-empted by FEGLIA. Id., at 36a.\nMaretta contended that Section D is also pre-empted by\nfederal law and that she should keep the insurance pro-\nceeds. The Circuit Court rejected Maretta\u2019s argument and\ngranted summary judgment to Hillman, finding Maretta\nliable to Hillman under Section D for the proceeds of\nWarren\u2019s policy. Id., at 58a.\n   The Virginia Supreme Court reversed and entered\njudgment for Maretta. 283 Va. 34, 46, 722 S. E. 2d 32, 38\n(2012). The court found that FEGLIA clearly instructed\nthat the insurance proceeds should be paid to a named\nbeneficiary. Id., at 44\u201346, 722 S. E. 2d, at 36\u201338. The\ncourt reasoned that \u201cCongress did not intend merely for\nthe named beneficiary in a FEGLI policy to receive the\nproceeds, only then to have them subject to recovery by a\nthird party under state law.\u201d Id., at 44, 722 S. E. 2d, at\n37. It therefore concluded that Section D is pre-empted by\nFEGLIA, because it \u201cstand[s] as an obstacle to the accom-\nplishment and execution of the full purposes and objec-\ntives of Congress.\u201d Id., at 45, 722 S. E. 2d, at 37 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve a\nconflict among the state and federal courts over whether\nFEGLIA pre-empts a rule of state law that automatically\nassigns an interest in the proceeds of a FEGLI policy to a\nperson other than the named beneficiary or grants that\n6                       HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nperson a right to recover such proceeds.1 We now affirm.\n                             II\n   Under the Supremacy Clause, Congress has the power\nto pre-empt state law expressly. See Brown v. Hotel\nEmployees, 468 U. S. 491, 500\u2013501 (1984). Although\nFEGLIA contains an express pre-emption provision, see\n\u00a78709(d)(1), the court below considered only whether\nSection D is pre-empted under conflict pre-emption princi-\nples. We limit our analysis here to that holding. State\nlaw is pre-empted \u201cto the extent of any conflict with a\nfederal statute.\u201d Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Coun-\ncil, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000) (citing Hines v. Davidowitz,\n312 U. S. 52, 66\u201367 (1941)). Such a conflict occurs when\ncompliance with both federal and state regulations is\nimpossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,\n373 U. S. 132, 142\u2013143 (1963), or when the state law\n\u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67. This case raises a question of\npurposes and objectives pre-emption.\n   The regulation of domestic relations is traditionally the\ndomain of state law. See In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593\u2013\n594 (1890). There is therefore a \u201cpresumption against pre-\nemption\u201d of state laws governing domestic relations,\nEgelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 151 (2001), and \u201cfamily\nand family-property law must do \u2018major damage\u2019 to \u2018clear\nand substantial\u2019 federal interests before the Supremacy\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Compare, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins.

Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46, 55 (1981).\n                              A\n   To determine whether a state law conflicts with Con-\ngress\u2019 purposes and objectives, we must first ascertain\nthe nature of the federal interest. Crosby, 530 U. S., at\n372\u2013373.\n   Hillman contends that Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting\nFEGLIA was to advance administrative convenience by\nestablishing a clear rule to dictate where the Government\nshould direct insurance proceeds. See Brief for Petitioner\n25. There is some force to Hillman\u2019s argument that a\nsignificant legislative interest in a large federal program\nlike FEGLIA is to enable its efficient administration. If\nHillman is correct that administrative convenience was\nCongress\u2019 only purpose, then there might be no conflict\nbetween Section D and FEGLIA: Section D\u2019s cause of\naction takes effect only after benefits have been paid, and\nso would not necessarily impact the Government\u2019s distri-\nbution of insurance proceeds. Cf. Hardy v. Hardy, 963\nN. E. 2d 470, 477\u2013478 (Ind. 2012).\n   For her part, Maretta insists that Congress had a more\nsubstantial purpose in enacting FEGLIA: to ensure that a\nduly named beneficiary will receive the insurance pro-\nceeds and be able to make use of them. Brief for Respond-\nent 21\u201322. If Maretta is correct, then Section D would\ndirectly conflict with that objective, because its cause of\naction would take the insurance proceeds away from the\nnamed beneficiary and reallocate them to someone else.\nWe must therefore determine which understanding of\n8                   HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFEGLIA\u2019s purpose is correct.\n    We do not write on a clean slate. In two previous cases,\nwe considered federal insurance statutes requiring that\ninsurance proceeds be paid to a named beneficiary and\nheld they pre-empted state laws that mandated a different\ndistribution of benefits. The statutes we addressed in\nthese cases are similar to FEGLIA. And the impediments\nto the federal interests in these prior cases are analogous\nto the one created by Section D of the Virginia statute.\nThese precedents accordingly govern our analysis of the\nrelationship between Section D and FEGLIA in this case.\n    In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), we consid-\nered whether the National Service Life Insurance Act of\n1940 (NSLIA), 54 Stat. 1008, pre-empted a rule of state\nmarital property law. Congress had enacted NSLIA to\n\u201caffor[d] a uniform and comprehensive system of life in-\nsurance for members and veterans of the armed forces of\nthe United States.\u201d Wissner, 338 U. S., at 658. A Califor-\nnia court granted the decedent\u2019s widow, who was not the\nnamed beneficiary, an interest in the insurance proceeds\nas community property under state law. Id., at 657.\n    We reversed, holding that NSLIA pre-empted the wid-\now\u2019s state-law action to recover the proceeds. Id., at 658.\nIn pertinent part, NSLIA provided that the insured \u201c \u2018shall\nhave the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries\nof the insurance [within a designated class], . . . and shall\n. . . at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 38 U. S. C. \u00a7802(g) (1946\ned.)). We reasoned that \u201cCongress has spoken with force\nand clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the\nnamed beneficiary and no other.\u201d 338 U. S., at 658. The\nCalifornia court\u2019s decision could not stand, we found,\nbecause it \u201csubstitute[d] the widow for the mother, who\nwas the beneficiary Congress directed shall receive the\ninsurance money.\u201d Id., at 659.\n    In Ridgway, we considered a similar question regarding\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe federal Servicemen\u2019s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965\n(SGLIA), Pub. L. 89\u2013214, 79 Stat. 880, another insurance\nscheme for members of the armed services. 454 U. S., at\n50\u201353. A Maine court imposed a constructive trust on\ninsurance proceeds paid to a servicemember\u2019s widow, who\nwas the named beneficiary, and ordered they be paid to\nthe decedent\u2019s first wife as required by the terms of a\ndivorce decree. Id., at 49\u201350.\n   In holding the constructive trust pre-empted, we ex-\nplained that the issue was \u201ccontrolled by Wissner.\u201d Id., at\n55. As in Wissner, the applicable provisions of SGLIA\nmade clear that \u201cthe insured service member possesses the\nright freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that\nchoice at any time by communicating the decision in writ-\ning to the proper office.\u201d 454 U. S., at 56 (citing Wissner,\n338 U. S., at 658). We also noted that SGLIA estab-\nlished an \u201c \u2018order of precedence,\u2019 \u201d which provided that the\nbenefits would be first paid to \u201c such \u2018beneficiary or bene-\nficiaries as the member . . . may have designated by [an\nappropriately filed] writing received prior to death.\u2019 \u201d 454\nU. S., at 52 (quoting 38 U. S. C. \u00a7770(a) (1976 ed.)). Not-\nwithstanding \u201csome small differences\u201d between SGLIA\nand NSLIA, we concluded that SGLIA\u2019s \u201cunqualified direc-\ntive to pay the proceeds to the properly designated bene-\nficiary clearly suggest[ed] that no different result was\nintended by Congress.\u201d 454 U. S., at 57.\n                             B\n  Our reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with\nequal force here. The statutes we considered in these\nearlier cases are strikingly similar to FEGLIA. Like\nNSLIA and SGLIA, FEGLIA creates a scheme that gives\nhighest priority to an insured\u2019s designated beneficiary. 5\nU. S. C. \u00a78705(a). Indeed, FEGLIA includes an \u201corder of\nprecedence\u201d that is nearly identical to the one in SGLIA:\nBoth require that the insurance proceeds be paid first to\n10                     HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe named beneficiary ahead of any other potential recipi-\nent. Compare ibid. with 38 U. S. C. \u00a7770(a) (1976 ed.)\n(now \u00a71970(a) (2006 ed.)). FEGLIA\u2019s implementing regu-\nlations further underscore that the employee\u2019s \u201cright\u201d of\ndesignation \u201ccannot be waived or restricted.\u201d 5 CFR\n\u00a7843.205(e). In FEGLIA, as in these other statutes, Con-\ngress \u201c \u2018spok[e] with force and clarity in directing that the\nproceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\u2019 \u201d\nRidgway, 454 U. S., at 55 (quoting Wissner, 338 U. S., at\n658; emphasis added). 2\n   Section D interferes with Congress\u2019 scheme, because it\ndirects that the proceeds actually \u201cbelong\u201d to someone\nother than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of\naction for their recovery by a third party. Ridgway, 454\nU. S., at 55; see Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(D). It makes no\ndifference whether state law requires the transfer of the\nproceeds, as Section A does, or creates a cause of action,\nlike Section D, that enables another person to receive the\nproceeds upon filing an action in state court. In either\ncase, state law displaces the beneficiary selected by the\ninsured in accordance with FEGLIA and places someone\nelse in her stead. As in Wissner, applicable state law\n\u201csubstitutes the widow\u201d for the \u201cbeneficiary Congress\ndirected shall receive the insurance money,\u201d 338 U. S., at\n659, and thereby \u201cfrustrates the deliberate purpose of\nCongress\u201d to ensure that a federal employee\u2019s named\nbeneficiary receives the proceeds. Ibid.\n   One can imagine plausible reasons to favor a different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Hillman points to some textual differences among NSLIA, SGLIA,\nand FEGLIA. She suggests, for example, that the provision of NSLIA\nenabling the appointment of a beneficiary does not use precisely the\n\u201c \u2018same language\u2019 \u201d as FEGLIA\u2019s order of precedence. Reply Brief 21.\nEven if there are \u201csome small differences\u201d in the statutory language,\nhowever, they do not diminish the critical similarity shared by the\nthree statutes: Each reflects Congress\u2019 \u201cunqualified directive\u201d that the\nproceeds accrue to a named beneficiary. Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 57.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy. Many employees perhaps neglect to update their\nbeneficiary designations after a change in marital status.\nAs a result, a legislature could have thought that a default\nrule providing that insurance proceeds accrue to a widow\nor widower, and not a named beneficiary, would be more\nlikely to align with most people\u2019s intentions. Or, similarly,\na legislature might have reasonably believed that an\nemployee\u2019s will is more reliable evidence of his intent than\na beneficiary designation form executed years earlier.\n   But that is not the judgment Congress made.3 Rather\nthan draw an inference about an employee\u2019s probable\nintent from a range of sources, Congress established a\nclear and predictable procedure for an employee to indi-\ncate who the intended beneficiary of his life insurance\nshall be. Like the statutes at issue in Ridgway and\nWissner, FEGLIA evinces Congress\u2019 decision to accord\nfederal employees an unfettered \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d in\nselecting the beneficiary of the insurance proceeds and to\nensure the proceeds would actually \u201cbelong\u201d to that bene-\nficiary. Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 56. An employee\u2019s ability\nto name a beneficiary acts as a \u201cguarantee of the complete\nand full performance of the contract to the exclusion of\nconflicting claims.\u201d Wissner, 338 U. S., at 660. With that\npromise comes the expectation that the insurance pro-\nceeds will be paid to the named beneficiary and that the\nbeneficiary can use them.\n   There is further confirmation that Congress intended\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In his concurrence, JUSTICE ALITO argues that one of FEGLIA\u2019s pur-\n\nposes is to \u201ceffectuat[e] . . . the insured\u2019s expressed intent\u201d and that\nevidence beyond an employee\u2019s named beneficiary could therefore be\nrelevant in some circumstances to determining that intent. Post, at 2\u20133\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). For the\nreasons explained, however, that statement of Congress\u2019 purpose is\nincomplete. See supra, at 9\u201310. Congress sought to ensure that an\nemployee\u2019s intent would be given effect only through the designation of\na beneficiary or through the narrow exceptions specifically provided in\nthe statute, see infra, at 12\u201313.\n12                      HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe insurance proceeds be paid in accordance with\nFEGLIA\u2019s procedures. Section 8705(e)(1) of FEGLIA\nprovides that \u201c[a]ny amount which would otherwise be\npaid . . . under the order of precedence\u201d shall be paid to\nanother person \u201cif and to the extent expressly provided for\nin the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment, or\nlegal separation.\u201d This exception, however, only applies if\nthe \u201cdecree, order, or agreement . . . is received, before the\ndate of the covered employee\u2019s death, by the employing\nagency.\u201d \u00a78705(e)(2). This provision allows the proceeds\nto be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary,\nbut if and only if the requisite documentation is filed with\nthe Government, so that any departure from the benefi-\nciary designation is managed within, not outside, the\nfederal system.4\n  We have explained that \u201c[w]here Congress explicitly\nenumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,\nadditional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence\nof evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\u201d Andrus v.\nGlover Constr. Co., 446 U. S. 608, 616\u2013617 (1980). Section\n8705(e) creates a limited exception to the order of prece-\ndence. If States could make alternative distributions\noutside the clear procedure Congress established, that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Congress  enacted 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(e) following federal-court deci-\nsions that found FEGLIA to pre-empt state-court constructive trust\nactions predicated upon divorce decrees. See, e.g., Gonzalez, 839 F. 2d,\nat 1439\u20131440. Reflecting this backdrop, the House Report noted that\n\u201cUnder current law, . . . divorce decrees . . . do not affect the payment of\nlife insurance proceeds. Instead, when the policyholder dies, the\nproceeds are paid to the beneficiary designated by the policyholder, if\nany, or to other individuals as specified by statute.\u201d H. R. Rep. No.\n105\u2013134, p. 2 (1997). To address the issue raised by these lower court\ncases, Congress could have amended FEGLIA to allow state law to take\nprecedence over the named beneficiary when there is any conflict with\na divorce decree or annulment. But Congress did not do so, and instead\ndescribed the precise conditions under which a divorce decree could\ndisplace an employee\u2019s named beneficiary.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould transform this narrow exception into a general\nlicense for state law to override FEGLIA. See TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28\u201329 (2001).5\n   In short, where a beneficiary has been duly named, the\ninsurance proceeds she is owed under FEGLIA cannot be\nallocated to another person by operation of state law.\nSection D does exactly that. We therefore agree with the\nVirginia Supreme Court that it is pre-empted.\n                             III\n  We are not persuaded by Hillman\u2019s additional argu-\nments in support of a different result.\n  Hillman contends that Ridgway and Wissner can be\ndistinguished because, unlike the statutes we considered\nin those cases, FEGLIA does not include an \u201canti-\nattachment provision.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 38\u201341. The\nanti-attachment provisions in NSLIA and SGLIA were\nidentical, and each broadly prohibited the \u201cattachment,\nlevy, or seizure\u201d of insurance proceeds by any legal pro-\ncess. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7454a (1946 ed.) (incorporated by refer-\nence in \u00a7816); \u00a7770(g) (1976 ed.). In Wissner and Ridgway,\nwe found that the relevant state laws violated these provi-\nsions and that this further conflict supported our conclu-\nsion that the state laws were pre-empted.\n  These discussions of the anti-attachment provisions,\nhowever, were alternative grounds to support the judg-\nment in each case, and not necessary components of the\nholdings. See Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 60\u201361 (describing\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Hillman  contends that \u00a78705(e) of FEGLIA indicates that Congress\ncontemplated that the proceeds could be paid to someone other than the\nnamed beneficiary and that Section D is consistent with that broad\nprinciple. Brief for Petitioner 43. As noted, however, \u00a78705(e) has the\nopposite implication, because it is framed as a specific exception to the\nrule that the proceeds accrue in all cases to the named beneficiary. It is\nnot, as Hillman suggests, a general rule authorizing state law to\nsupersede FEGLIA.\n14                 HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseparately the anti-attachment provision and noting that\nthe state law \u201calso\u201d conflicted with it); id., at 60 (noting\nthat in Wissner we found an \u201canti-attachment provision\n. . . as an independent ground for the result reached in\nthat case\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Rose v. Rose, 481\nU. S. 619, 631 (1987) (describing Wissner\u2019s treatment of\nthe anti-attachment provision as \u201cclearly an alternative\nholding\u201d). The absence of an anti-attachment provision in\nFEGLIA does not render Ridgway\u2019s and Wissner\u2019s primary\nholdings any less applicable here.\n    Next, Hillman suggests that Wissner and Ridgway can\nbe set aside because FEGLIA contains an express pre-\nemption provision and that conflict pre-emption principles\nordinarily do not apply when that is so. Brief for Petitioner\n45\u201347. As noted, the court below did not pass on the\nparties\u2019 express pre-emption arguments, and thus we sim-\nilarly address only conflict pre-emption. See supra, at 7.\nAnd we need not consider whether Section D is expressly\npre-empted, because Hillman is incorrect to suggest\nthat FEGLIA\u2019s express pre-emption provision renders\nconflict pre-emption inapplicable. Rather, we have made\nclear that the existence of a separate pre-emption provi-\nsion \u201c \u2018does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-\nemption principles.\u2019 \u201d Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU. S. 51, 65 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); see\nArizona v. United States, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip\nop., at 14).\n    Hillman further argues that Ridgway is not controlling\nbecause a provision of FEGLIA specifically authorizes an\nemployee to assign a FEGLI policy, whereas SGLIA\u2019s\nimplementing regulations prohibit such an assignment.\nSee 5 U. S. C. \u00a78706(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V); 38 CFR \u00a79.6\n(2012).    The premise of Hillman\u2019s argument is that\nFEGLIA\u2019s assignment provision suggests that an employee\nhas a less substantial interest in who ultimately re-\nceives the proceeds.

If the\ninsured fails to designate a beneficiary, FEGLIA provides\na specific order in which benefits must be distributed: next\nto \u201cthe widow or widower of the employee\u201d; absent a widow\nor widower, to \u201cthe child or children of the employee and\ndescendants of [the] deceased children\u201d; and so on. Ibid.;\nante, at 2. The insured has the right to change his benefi-\nciary designation \u201cat any time without the knowledge or\nconsent of the previous beneficiary,\u201d and \u201c[t]his right\ncannot be waived or restricted.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7870.802(f).\n  Section D directly conflicts with this statutory scheme,\nbecause it nullifies the insured\u2019s statutory right to desig-\nnate a beneficiary. The right to designate a beneficiary\nencompasses a corresponding right in the named benefi-\nciary not only to receive the proceeds, but also to retain\nthem. Indeed, the \u201cright\u201d to designate a beneficiary\u2014as\nwell as the term \u201cbeneficiary\u201d itself\u2014would be meaning-\nless if the only effect of a designation were to saddle the\nnominal beneficiary with liability under state law for the\nfull value of the proceeds. But Section D accomplishes\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nexactly that: It transforms the designated beneficiary into\na defendant in state court, a defendant who is now liable\nto the individual the State has designated as the true\nbeneficiary. While Hillman does not insist that the in-\nsurer should have mailed the check to her (as opposed to\nMaretta, the designated beneficiary), Section D requires,\nin effect, this very result. See ante, at 10 (\u201c[Section D]\ndisplaces the beneficiary selected by the insured in ac-\ncordance with FEGLIA and places someone else in her\nstead\u201d). If the right to designate a beneficiary means\nanything, we must conclude that Section D directly con-\nflicts with FEGLIA\u2019s order of precedence.\n   The direct conflict between Section D and FEGLIA is\nalso evident in the fact that Section D\u2019s only function is to\naccomplish what Section A would have achieved, had\nSection A not been pre-empted. Section A provides that,\n    \u201cupon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce\n    from the bond of matrimony . . . , any revocable bene-\n    ficiary designation contained in a then existing writ-\n    ten contract owned by one party that provides for the\n    payment of any death benefit to the other party is re-\n    voked. A death benefit prevented from passing to\n    a former spouse by this section shall be paid as if\n    the former spouse had predeceased the decedent.\u201d Va.\n    Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A) (Lexis Cum. Supp. 2012).\nBoth parties agree that FEGLIA pre-empts this provision.\nBrief for Petitioner 4\u20135; Brief for Respondent 2; see also\n283 Va. 34, 52, 722 S. E. 2d 32, 35 (2012). And for good\nreason: if an insured has designated his former spouse as\nthe beneficiary of his life insurance policy, Section A pur-\nports to \u201crevok[e]\u201d that designation in the event of divorce\nor annulment. By purporting to so alter FEGLIA\u2019s statu-\ntory order of precedence, Section A is clearly pre-empted\nby federal law. Tellingly, it is precisely in this context\u2014\nand only in this context\u2014that Section D operates. See\n4                  HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a720\u2013111.1(D). Of course, Section D does not preclude the\ndirect payment of benefits to the designated beneficiary;\nhowever, it accomplishes the same prohibited result by\ntransforming the designated party into little more than\na passthrough for the true beneficiary. This cannot be\nsquared with FEGLIA. Consequently, Section D must\nyield.\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat Section D is pre-empted and, therefore, concur in the\njudgment.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

JUDY A.\n\n                 MARETTA\n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       VIRGINIA\n\n                         [June 3, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   I concur in the judgment. Because one of the purposes\nof the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance Act of\n1954 (FEGLIA) is to implement the expressed wishes of\nthe insured, I would hold that a state law is pre-empted\nif it effectively overrides an insured\u2019s actual, articulated\nchoice of beneficiary. The challenged provision of Virginia\nlaw has that effect.\n   By way of background, Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A)\n(Lexis Supp. 2012) provides that the entry of a divorce de-\ncree automatically revokes an insured\u2019s prior designa-\ntion of his or her former spouse as the beneficiary of the\npolicy. And where, as in this case, the insured remarries\nafter the divorce and dies before making a new FEGLIA\ndesignation, the proceeds, under 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a), are\nautomatically paid to the insured\u2019s former spouse. Under\nthe provision of Virginia law at issue here, the surviving\nspouse is entitled to recover those proceeds from the for-\nmer spouse. See Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(D). Section\n20\u2013111.1(D) apparently requires this result even if the in-\nsured manifests a clear contrary intent, such as by provid-\ning specifically in a recent will that the proceeds are to go\nto another party\u2014for example, the insured\u2019s children by\nthe former marriage. Because \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) overrides the\ninsured\u2019s express intent (whether that intent is expressed\n2                   HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvia a beneficiary designation or through other reliable\nmeans), I agree that it is pre-empted by FEGLIA.\n   Interpreted in light of our prior decisions in Wissner v.\nWissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), and Ridgway v. Ridgway,\n454 U. S. 46 (1981), FEGLIA seems to me to have two\nprimary purposes or objectives.\n   The first is administrative convenience. It is easier for\nan insurance administrator to pay insurance proceeds to\nthe person whom the insured has designated on a specified\nform without having to consider claims made by others\nbased on some other ground. But \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) does not\naffect the initial payment of proceeds. It operates after\nthe funds are received by the designated beneficiary, and it\nthus causes no inconvenience for those who administer the\npayment of FEGLIA proceeds.\n   The second purpose or objective is the effectuation of the\ninsured\u2019s expressed intent above all other considerations.\nThat was the basis for the decisions in Wissner and Ridg-\nway, as I understand them. In both cases, there was a\nconflict between a person whom the insured had desig-\nnated as his beneficiary and another person whose claim to\nthe proceeds was not based on the insured\u2019s expressed\nintent, and in both cases, the Court held in favor of the\ndesignated beneficiary.\n   The present case bears a similarity to Wissner and\nRidgway in that petitioner\u2019s claim depends upon a state stat-\nute that automatically alters the ultimate recipient of\na divorced employee\u2019s insurance proceeds. To be sure,\nVirginia\u2019s provision may well reflect the unexpressed\npreferences of the majority of insureds whose situations\nare similar to that of the insured in this case\u2014that is,\nindividuals who, after divorce and remarriage, fail to\nchange a prior designation of a former spouse as the bene-\nficiary of the policy. But FEGLIA prioritizes the insured\u2019s\nexpressed intent. And it is telling that, on petitioner\u2019s\ntheory, she would still be entitled to the insurance pro-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nceeds even if, for example, the insured had died shortly\nafter executing a new will leaving those proceeds to some-\none else. This shows that her claim is based on something\nother than a manifestation of the insured\u2019s intent. Be-\ncause \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) operates as a blunt tool to override the\ninsured\u2019s express declaration of his or her intent, it con-\nflicts with FEGLIA\u2019s purpose of prioritizing an insured\u2019s\narticulated wishes above all other considerations.\n   In affirming the decision below, the Court goes well\nbeyond what is necessary and opines that the party desig-\nnated as the beneficiary under a FEGLIA policy must\nbe allowed to keep the insurance proceeds even if the in-\nsured\u2019s contrary and expressed intent is indisputable\u2014for\nexample, when the insured writes a postdivorce will spe-\ncifically leaving the proceeds to someone else. See ante,\nat 11. The Court\u2019s explanation is as follows: \u201cCongress\nsought to ensure that an employee\u2019s intent would be given\neffect only through the designation of a beneficiary or\nthrough the narrow exceptions specifically provided in the\nstatute.\u201d Ibid., n. 3. In other words, Congress wanted the\ndesignated beneficiary\u2014rather than the person named\nin a later will\u2014to keep the proceeds because Congress\nwanted the named beneficiary to keep the proceeds. Need-\nless the say, this circular reasoning does not explain why\nCongress might have wanted the designated beneficiary to\nkeep the proceeds even when that is indisputably contrary\nto the insured\u2019s expressed wishes at the time of death. I\nam doubtful that any purpose or objective of FEGLIA\nwould be honored by such a holding, but it is not necessary\nto resolve that question in this case.\n   For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n",

Argued April 22, 2013\u2014Decided June 3, 2013\nThe Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 (FEGLIA)\n  establishes an insurance program for federal employees. FEGLIA\n  permits an employee to name a beneficiary of life insurance proceeds,\n  and specifies an \u201corder of precedence\u201d providing that an employee\u2019s\n  death benefits accrue first to that beneficiary ahead of other potential\n  recipients. 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a). A Virginia statute revokes a benefi-\n  ciary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a\n  former spouse where there has been a change in the decedent\u2019s mari-\n  tal status. Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A) (Section A). In the event that\n  this provision is pre-empted by federal law, a separate provision of\n  Virginia law, Section D, provides a cause of action rendering the for-\n  mer spouse liable for the principal amount of the proceeds to the par-\n  ty who would have received them were Section A not pre-empted.\n  \u00a720\u2013111.1(D).\n    Warren Hillman named then-spouse, respondent Judy Maretta, as\n  the beneficiary of his Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance\n  (FEGLI) policy. After their divorce, he married petitioner Jacqueline\n  Hillman but never changed his named FEGLI beneficiary. After\n  Warren\u2019s death, Maretta, still the named beneficiary, filed a claim for\n  the FEGLI proceeds and collected them. Hillman sued in Virginia\n  court, seeking recovery of the proceeds under Section D. Maretta ar-\n  gued in response that Section D is pre-empted by federal law. The\n  parties agreed that Section A is pre-empted. The Virginia Circuit\n  Court found Maretta liable to Hillman under Section D for the\n  FEGLI policy proceeds. The State Supreme Court reversed, conclud-\n  ing that Section D is pre-empted by FEGLIA because it conflicts with\n  the purposes and objectives of Congress.\nHeld: Section D of the Virginia statute is pre-empted by FEGLIA.\n Pp. 6\u201315.\n2                        HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n       (a) State law is pre-empted \u201cto the extent of any conflict with a\n    federal statute.\u201d Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U. S.\n    363, 372. This case raises the question whether Virginia law \u201cstands\n    as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full pur-\n    poses and objectives of Congress.\u201d Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52,\n    67. Pp. 6\u201313.\n         (1) To determine whether a state law conflicts with Congress\u2019\n    purposes and objectives, the nature of the federal interest must first\n    be ascertained. Crosby, 530 U. S., at 372\u2013373. Two previous cases\n    govern the analysis of the relationship between Section D and\n    FEGLIA here. In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655, a California\n    court granted a decedent\u2019s widow, who was not the named beneficiary\n    of a policy under the federal National Service Life Insurance Act of\n    1940 (NSLIA), an interest in the insurance proceeds as community\n    property under state law. This Court reversed. Because NSLIA pro-\n    vided that the insured had a right to designate a beneficiary and\n    could change that designation at any time, the Court reasoned that\n    Congress had \u201cspoken with force and clarity in directing that the pro-\n    ceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\u201d Id., at 658. The\n    Court addressed a similar question regarding the federal Service-\n    men\u2019s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965 (SGLIA) in Ridgway v.\n    Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46. There, a Maine court imposed a constructive\n    trust on insurance proceeds paid to a servicemember\u2019s widow, the\n    named beneficiary, and ordered that they be paid to the decedent\u2019s\n    first wife as required by a divorce decree. Holding the constructive\n    trust pre-empted, the Ridgway Court explained that Wissner con-\n    trolled and that SGLIA made clear that \u201cthe insured service member\n    possesses the right freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter\n    that choice at any time by communicating the decision in writing to\n    the proper office.\u201d Id., at 56. Pp. 7\u20139.\n         (2) The reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with equal\n    force here. NSLIA and SGLIA are strikingly similar to FEGLIA,\n    which creates a scheme that gives highest priority to an insured\u2019s\n    designated beneficiary, \u00a78705(a), and which underscores that the\n    employee\u2019s \u201cright\u201d of designation \u201ccannot be waived or restricted,\u201d 5\n    CFR \u00a7843.205(e). Section D interferes with this scheme, because it\n    directs that the proceeds actually belong to someone other than the\n    named beneficiary by creating a cause of action for their recovery by\n    a third party. FEGLIA establishes a clear and predictable procedure\n    for an employee to indicate who the intended beneficiary shall be and\n    evinces Congress\u2019 decision to accord federal employees an unfettered\n    freedom of choice in selecting a beneficiary and to ensure the pro-\n    ceeds actually belong to that beneficiary. This conclusion is con-\n    firmed by another provision of FEGLIA, \u00a78705(e), which creates a\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

If States\n  could make alternative distributions outside the clear procedure\n  Congress established, \u00a78705(e)\u2019s narrow exception would be trans-\n  formed into a general license for state law to override FEGLIA.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n    (b) Hillman\u2019s additional arguments in support of a different result\n  are unpersuasive.

FEGLIA pro-\nvides that an employee may designate a beneficiary to\nreceive the proceeds of his life insurance at the time of his\ndeath. \u00a78705(a). Separately, a Virginia statute addresses\nthe situation in which an employee\u2019s marital status has\nchanged, but he did not update his beneficiary designation\nbefore his death. Section 20\u2013111.1(D) of the Virginia Code\nrenders a former spouse liable for insurance proceeds to\nwhoever would have received them under applicable law,\nusually a widow or widower, but for the beneficiary desig-\nnation. Va.

Pursuant to the authority\ngranted to it by FEGLIA, OPM entered into a life insur-\nance contract with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Com-\npany. See \u00a78709; 5 CFR \u00a7870.102 (2013). Individual\nemployees enrolled in the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life\nInsurance (FEGLI) Program receive coverage through this\ncontract. The program is of substantial size. In 2010, the\ntotal amount of FEGLI insurance coverage in force was\n$824 billion. GAO, Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insur-\nance: Retirement Benefit and Retained Asset Account\nDisclosures Could Be Improved 1 (GAO\u201312\u201394, 2011).\n   FEGLIA provides that, upon an employee\u2019s death, life\ninsurance benefits are paid in accordance with a specified\n\u201corder of precedence.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a).

See Brown v. Hotel\nEmployees, 468 U. S. 491, 500\u2013501 (1984). Although\nFEGLIA contains an express pre-emption provision, see\n\u00a78709(d)(1), the court below considered only whether\nSection D is pre-empted under conflict pre-emption princi-\nples. We limit our analysis here to that holding. State\nlaw is pre-empted \u201cto the extent of any conflict with a\nfederal statute.\u201d Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Coun-\ncil, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000) (citing Hines v. Davidowitz,\n312 U. S. 52, 66\u201367 (1941)). Such a conflict occurs when\ncompliance with both federal and state regulations is\nimpossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,\n373 U. S. 132, 142\u2013143 (1963), or when the state law\n\u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-\ntion of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d\nHines, 312 U. S., at 67. This case raises a question of\npurposes and objectives pre-emption.\n   The regulation of domestic relations is traditionally the\ndomain of state law. See In re Burrus, 136 U.

But\nfamily law is not entirely insulated from conflict pre-\nemption principles, and so we have recognized that state\nlaws \u201cgoverning the economic aspects of domestic relations\n. . . must give way to clearly conflicting federal enact-\nments.\u201d Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46, 55 (1981).\n                              A\n   To determine whether a state law conflicts with Con-\ngress\u2019 purposes and objectives, we must first ascertain\nthe nature of the federal interest. Crosby, 530 U. S., at\n372\u2013373.\n   Hillman contends that Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting\nFEGLIA was to advance administrative convenience by\nestablishing a clear rule to dictate where the Government\nshould direct insurance proceeds. See Brief for Petitioner\n25. There is some force to Hillman\u2019s argument that a\nsignificant legislative interest in a large federal program\nlike FEGLIA is to enable its efficient administration. If\nHillman is correct that administrative convenience was\nCongress\u2019 only purpose, then there might be no conflict\nbetween Section D and FEGLIA: Section D\u2019s cause of\naction takes effect only after benefits have been paid, and\nso would not necessarily impact the Government\u2019s distri-\nbution of insurance proceeds. Cf. Hardy v. Hardy, 963\nN. E. 2d 470, 477\u2013478 (Ind. 2012).\n   For her part, Maretta insists that Congress had a more\nsubstantial purpose in enacting FEGLIA: to ensure that a\nduly named beneficiary will receive the insurance pro-\nceeds and be able to make use of them. Brief for Respond-\nent 21\u201322. If Maretta is correct, then Section D would\ndirectly conflict with that objective, because its cause of\naction would take the insurance proceeds away from the\nnamed beneficiary and reallocate them to someone else.\nWe must therefore determine which understanding of\n8                   HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFEGLIA\u2019s purpose is correct.\n    We do not write on a clean slate. In two previous cases,\nwe considered federal insurance statutes requiring that\ninsurance proceeds be paid to a named beneficiary and\nheld they pre-empted state laws that mandated a different\ndistribution of benefits. The statutes we addressed in\nthese cases are similar to FEGLIA. And the impediments\nto the federal interests in these prior cases are analogous\nto the one created by Section D of the Virginia statute.\nThese precedents accordingly govern our analysis of the\nrelationship between Section D and FEGLIA in this case.\n    In Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), we consid-\nered whether the National Service Life Insurance Act of\n1940 (NSLIA), 54 Stat. 1008, pre-empted a rule of state\nmarital property law. Congress had enacted NSLIA to\n\u201caffor[d] a uniform and comprehensive system of life in-\nsurance for members and veterans of the armed forces of\nthe United States.\u201d Wissner, 338 U. S., at 658. A Califor-\nnia court granted the decedent\u2019s widow, who was not the\nnamed beneficiary, an interest in the insurance proceeds\nas community property under state law. Id., at 657.\n    We reversed, holding that NSLIA pre-empted the wid-\now\u2019s state-law action to recover the proceeds. Id., at 658.\nIn pertinent part, NSLIA provided that the insured \u201c \u2018shall\nhave the right to designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries\nof the insurance [within a designated class], . . . and shall\n. . . at all times have the right to change the beneficiary or\nbeneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting 38 U. S. C. \u00a7802(g) (1946\ned.)). We reasoned that \u201cCongress has spoken with force\nand clarity in directing that the proceeds belong to the\nnamed beneficiary and no other.\u201d 338 U. S., at 658. The\nCalifornia court\u2019s decision could not stand, we found,\nbecause it \u201csubstitute[d] the widow for the mother, who\nwas the beneficiary Congress directed shall receive the\ninsurance money.\u201d Id., at 659.\n    In Ridgway, we considered a similar question regarding\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe federal Servicemen\u2019s Group Life Insurance Act of 1965\n(SGLIA), Pub. L. 89\u2013214, 79 Stat. 880, another insurance\nscheme for members of the armed services. 454 U. S., at\n50\u201353. A Maine court imposed a constructive trust on\ninsurance proceeds paid to a servicemember\u2019s widow, who\nwas the named beneficiary, and ordered they be paid to\nthe decedent\u2019s first wife as required by the terms of a\ndivorce decree. Id., at 49\u201350.\n   In holding the constructive trust pre-empted, we ex-\nplained that the issue was \u201ccontrolled by Wissner.\u201d Id., at\n55. As in Wissner, the applicable provisions of SGLIA\nmade clear that \u201cthe insured service member possesses the\nright freely to designate the beneficiary and to alter that\nchoice at any time by communicating the decision in writ-\ning to the proper office.\u201d 454 U. S., at 56 (citing Wissner,\n338 U. S., at 658). We also noted that SGLIA estab-\nlished an \u201c \u2018order of precedence,\u2019 \u201d which provided that the\nbenefits would be first paid to \u201c such \u2018beneficiary or bene-\nficiaries as the member . . . may have designated by [an\nappropriately filed] writing received prior to death.\u2019 \u201d 454\nU. S., at 52 (quoting 38 U. S. C. \u00a7770(a) (1976 ed.)). Not-\nwithstanding \u201csome small differences\u201d between SGLIA\nand NSLIA, we concluded that SGLIA\u2019s \u201cunqualified direc-\ntive to pay the proceeds to the properly designated bene-\nficiary clearly suggest[ed] that no different result was\nintended by Congress.\u201d 454 U. S., at 57.\n                             B\n  Our reasoning in Wissner and Ridgway applies with\nequal force here. The statutes we considered in these\nearlier cases are strikingly similar to FEGLIA. Like\nNSLIA and SGLIA, FEGLIA creates a scheme that gives\nhighest priority to an insured\u2019s designated beneficiary. 5\nU. S. C. \u00a78705(a). Indeed, FEGLIA includes an \u201corder of\nprecedence\u201d that is nearly identical to the one in SGLIA:\nBoth require that the insurance proceeds be paid first to\n10                     HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nthe named beneficiary ahead of any other potential recipi-\nent. Compare ibid. with 38 U. S. C. \u00a7770(a) (1976 ed.)\n(now \u00a71970(a) (2006 ed.)). FEGLIA\u2019s implementing regu-\nlations further underscore that the employee\u2019s \u201cright\u201d of\ndesignation \u201ccannot be waived or restricted.\u201d 5 CFR\n\u00a7843.205(e). In FEGLIA, as in these other statutes, Con-\ngress \u201c \u2018spok[e] with force and clarity in directing that the\nproceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other.\u2019 \u201d\nRidgway, 454 U. S., at 55 (quoting Wissner, 338 U. S., at\n658; emphasis added). 2\n   Section D interferes with Congress\u2019 scheme, because it\ndirects that the proceeds actually \u201cbelong\u201d to someone\nother than the named beneficiary by creating a cause of\naction for their recovery by a third party. Ridgway, 454\nU. S., at 55; see Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(D). It makes no\ndifference whether state law requires the transfer of the\nproceeds, as Section A does, or creates a cause of action,\nlike Section D, that enables another person to receive the\nproceeds upon filing an action in state court. In either\ncase, state law displaces the beneficiary selected by the\ninsured in accordance with FEGLIA and places someone\nelse in her stead. As in Wissner, applicable state law\n\u201csubstitutes the widow\u201d for the \u201cbeneficiary Congress\ndirected shall receive the insurance money,\u201d 338 U. S., at\n659, and thereby \u201cfrustrates the deliberate purpose of\nCongress\u201d to ensure that a federal employee\u2019s named\nbeneficiary receives the proceeds. Ibid.\n   One can imagine plausible reasons to favor a different\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Hillman points to some textual differences among NSLIA, SGLIA,\nand FEGLIA. She suggests, for example, that the provision of NSLIA\nenabling the appointment of a beneficiary does not use precisely the\n\u201c \u2018same language\u2019 \u201d as FEGLIA\u2019s order of precedence. Reply Brief 21.\nEven if there are \u201csome small differences\u201d in the statutory language,\nhowever, they do not diminish the critical similarity shared by the\nthree statutes: Each reflects Congress\u2019 \u201cunqualified directive\u201d that the\nproceeds accrue to a named beneficiary. Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 57.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy. Many employees perhaps neglect to update their\nbeneficiary designations after a change in marital status.\nAs a result, a legislature could have thought that a default\nrule providing that insurance proceeds accrue to a widow\nor widower, and not a named beneficiary, would be more\nlikely to align with most people\u2019s intentions. Or, similarly,\na legislature might have reasonably believed that an\nemployee\u2019s will is more reliable evidence of his intent than\na beneficiary designation form executed years earlier.\n   But that is not the judgment Congress made.3 Rather\nthan draw an inference about an employee\u2019s probable\nintent from a range of sources, Congress established a\nclear and predictable procedure for an employee to indi-\ncate who the intended beneficiary of his life insurance\nshall be. Like the statutes at issue in Ridgway and\nWissner, FEGLIA evinces Congress\u2019 decision to accord\nfederal employees an unfettered \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d in\nselecting the beneficiary of the insurance proceeds and to\nensure the proceeds would actually \u201cbelong\u201d to that bene-\nficiary. Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 56. An employee\u2019s ability\nto name a beneficiary acts as a \u201cguarantee of the complete\nand full performance of the contract to the exclusion of\nconflicting claims.\u201d Wissner, 338 U. S., at 660. With that\npromise comes the expectation that the insurance pro-\nceeds will be paid to the named beneficiary and that the\nbeneficiary can use them.\n   There is further confirmation that Congress intended\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 In his concurrence, JUSTICE ALITO argues that one of FEGLIA\u2019s pur-\n\nposes is to \u201ceffectuat[e] . . . the insured\u2019s expressed intent\u201d and that\nevidence beyond an employee\u2019s named beneficiary could therefore be\nrelevant in some circumstances to determining that intent. Post, at 2\u20133\n(opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). For the\nreasons explained, however, that statement of Congress\u2019 purpose is\nincomplete. See supra, at 9\u201310. Congress sought to ensure that an\nemployee\u2019s intent would be given effect only through the designation of\na beneficiary or through the narrow exceptions specifically provided in\nthe statute, see infra, at 12\u201313.\n12                      HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nthe insurance proceeds be paid in accordance with\nFEGLIA\u2019s procedures. Section 8705(e)(1) of FEGLIA\nprovides that \u201c[a]ny amount which would otherwise be\npaid . . . under the order of precedence\u201d shall be paid to\nanother person \u201cif and to the extent expressly provided for\nin the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment, or\nlegal separation.\u201d This exception, however, only applies if\nthe \u201cdecree, order, or agreement . . . is received, before the\ndate of the covered employee\u2019s death, by the employing\nagency.\u201d \u00a78705(e)(2). This provision allows the proceeds\nto be paid to someone other than the named beneficiary,\nbut if and only if the requisite documentation is filed with\nthe Government, so that any departure from the benefi-\nciary designation is managed within, not outside, the\nfederal system.4\n  We have explained that \u201c[w]here Congress explicitly\nenumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,\nadditional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence\nof evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\u201d Andrus v.\nGlover Constr. Co., 446 U. S. 608, 616\u2013617 (1980). Section\n8705(e) creates a limited exception to the order of prece-\ndence. If States could make alternative distributions\noutside the clear procedure Congress established, that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Congress  enacted 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(e) following federal-court deci-\nsions that found FEGLIA to pre-empt state-court constructive trust\nactions predicated upon divorce decrees. See, e.g., Gonzalez, 839 F. 2d,\nat 1439\u20131440. Reflecting this backdrop, the House Report noted that\n\u201cUnder current law, . . . divorce decrees . . . do not affect the payment of\nlife insurance proceeds. Instead, when the policyholder dies, the\nproceeds are paid to the beneficiary designated by the policyholder, if\nany, or to other individuals as specified by statute.\u201d H. R. Rep. No.\n105\u2013134, p. 2 (1997). To address the issue raised by these lower court\ncases, Congress could have amended FEGLIA to allow state law to take\nprecedence over the named beneficiary when there is any conflict with\na divorce decree or annulment. But Congress did not do so, and instead\ndescribed the precise conditions under which a divorce decree could\ndisplace an employee\u2019s named beneficiary.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould transform this narrow exception into a general\nlicense for state law to override FEGLIA.

S. 19, 28\u201329 (2001).5\n   In short, where a beneficiary has been duly named, the\ninsurance proceeds she is owed under FEGLIA cannot be\nallocated to another person by operation of state law.\nSection D does exactly that. We therefore agree with the\nVirginia Supreme Court that it is pre-empted.\n                             III\n  We are not persuaded by Hillman\u2019s additional argu-\nments in support of a different result.\n  Hillman contends that Ridgway and Wissner can be\ndistinguished because, unlike the statutes we considered\nin those cases, FEGLIA does not include an \u201canti-\nattachment provision.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 38\u201341. The\nanti-attachment provisions in NSLIA and SGLIA were\nidentical, and each broadly prohibited the \u201cattachment,\nlevy, or seizure\u201d of insurance proceeds by any legal pro-\ncess. 38 U. S. C. \u00a7454a (1946 ed.) (incorporated by refer-\nence in \u00a7816); \u00a7770(g) (1976 ed.). In Wissner and Ridgway,\nwe found that the relevant state laws violated these provi-\nsions and that this further conflict supported our conclu-\nsion that the state laws were pre-empted.\n  These discussions of the anti-attachment provisions,\nhowever, were alternative grounds to support the judg-\nment in each case, and not necessary components of the\nholdings. See Ridgway, 454 U. S., at 60\u201361 (describing\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Hillman  contends that \u00a78705(e) of FEGLIA indicates that Congress\ncontemplated that the proceeds could be paid to someone other than the\nnamed beneficiary and that Section D is consistent with that broad\nprinciple. Brief for Petitioner 43. As noted, however, \u00a78705(e) has the\nopposite implication, because it is framed as a specific exception to the\nrule that the proceeds accrue in all cases to the named beneficiary. It is\nnot, as Hillman suggests, a general rule authorizing state law to\nsupersede FEGLIA.\n14                 HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nseparately the anti-attachment provision and noting that\nthe state law \u201calso\u201d conflicted with it); id., at 60 (noting\nthat in Wissner we found an \u201canti-attachment provision\n. . . as an independent ground for the result reached in\nthat case\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Rose v. Rose, 481\nU. S. 619, 631 (1987) (describing Wissner\u2019s treatment of\nthe anti-attachment provision as \u201cclearly an alternative\nholding\u201d). The absence of an anti-attachment provision in\nFEGLIA does not render Ridgway\u2019s and Wissner\u2019s primary\nholdings any less applicable here.\n    Next, Hillman suggests that Wissner and Ridgway can\nbe set aside because FEGLIA contains an express pre-\nemption provision and that conflict pre-emption principles\nordinarily do not apply when that is so. Brief for Petitioner\n45\u201347. As noted, the court below did not pass on the\nparties\u2019 express pre-emption arguments, and thus we sim-\nilarly address only conflict pre-emption. See supra, at 7.\nAnd we need not consider whether Section D is expressly\npre-empted, because Hillman is incorrect to suggest\nthat FEGLIA\u2019s express pre-emption provision renders\nconflict pre-emption inapplicable. Rather, we have made\nclear that the existence of a separate pre-emption provi-\nsion \u201c \u2018does not bar the ordinary working of conflict pre-\nemption principles.\u2019 \u201d Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537\nU. S. 51, 65 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); see\nArizona v. United States, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip\nop., at 14).\n    Hillman further argues that Ridgway is not controlling\nbecause a provision of FEGLIA specifically authorizes an\nemployee to assign a FEGLI policy, whereas SGLIA\u2019s\nimplementing regulations prohibit such an assignment.\nSee 5 U. S. C. \u00a78706(f)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. V); 38 CFR \u00a79.6\n(2012).    The premise of Hillman\u2019s argument is that\nFEGLIA\u2019s assignment provision suggests that an employee\nhas a less substantial interest in who ultimately re-\nceives the proceeds. But an employee\u2019s ability to assign a\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Congress\u2019 aim of increasing the\nmorale of the armed services, however, was not the basis\nof our pre-emption analysis in either case. See Wissner,\n338 U. S., at 658\u2013659; Ridgway, 454 U.

Accordingly, we\nhold that Section D is pre-empted by federal law.

S. C. \u00a78701 et seq. But I cannot join the \u201cpurposes and\nobjectives\u201d framework that the majority uses to reach this\nconclusion. Ante, at 6. That framework is an illegitimate\nbasis for finding the pre-emption of state law, see Wyeth v.\nLevine, 555 U. S. 555, 583 (2009) (THOMAS, J., concurring\nin judgment), and is entirely unnecessary to the result in\nthis case, because the ordinary meanings of FEGLIA and\nSection D directly conflict. Accordingly, I concur only in\nthe judgment.\n  The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law\n\u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in\nthe Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary\nnothwithstanding.\u201d Art.

As I have noted before,\ncourts assessing whether state and federal law conflict\nshould not engage in a freewheeling inquiry into whether\nstate law undermines supposed federal purposes and ob-\njectives. Id., at 588. Such an approach looks beyond the\ntext of enacted federal law and thereby permits the Fed-\n2                   HILLMAN v.

Id., at 586\u2013587. Pre-\nemption analysis should, therefore, instead hew closely to\nthe text and structure of the provisions at issue, and a\ncourt should find pre-emption only when the \u201c \u2018ordinary\nmeaning\u2019 \u201d of duly enacted federal law \u201ceffectively repeal[s]\ncontrary state law.\u201d PLIVA, supra, at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at\n14\u201315, 17).\n  Applying these principles, it is clear that the ordinary\nmeaning of FEGLIA directly conflicts with Section D.\nFEGLIA provides that life insurance benefits are paid\naccording to a particular \u201corder of precedence.\u201d 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a78705(a); see also 5 CFR \u00a7870.801(a) (2013). The benefits\nare distributed first to \u201cthe beneficiary or beneficiaries\ndesignated by the employee in a signed and witnessed\nwriting received before death.\u201d 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a). If the\ninsured fails to designate a beneficiary, FEGLIA provides\na specific order in which benefits must be distributed: next\nto \u201cthe widow or widower of the employee\u201d; absent a widow\nor widower, to \u201cthe child or children of the employee and\ndescendants of [the] deceased children\u201d; and so on. Ibid.;\nante, at 2. The insured has the right to change his benefi-\nciary designation \u201cat any time without the knowledge or\nconsent of the previous beneficiary,\u201d and \u201c[t]his right\ncannot be waived or restricted.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7870.802(f).\n  Section D directly conflicts with this statutory scheme,\nbecause it nullifies the insured\u2019s statutory right to desig-\nnate a beneficiary. The right to designate a beneficiary\nencompasses a corresponding right in the named benefi-\nciary not only to receive the proceeds, but also to retain\nthem. Indeed, the \u201cright\u201d to designate a beneficiary\u2014as\nwell as the term \u201cbeneficiary\u201d itself\u2014would be meaning-\nless if the only effect of a designation were to saddle the\nnominal beneficiary with liability under state law for the\nfull value of the proceeds. But Section D accomplishes\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nexactly that: It transforms the designated beneficiary into\na defendant in state court, a defendant who is now liable\nto the individual the State has designated as the true\nbeneficiary. While Hillman does not insist that the in-\nsurer should have mailed the check to her (as opposed to\nMaretta, the designated beneficiary), Section D requires,\nin effect, this very result. See ante, at 10 (\u201c[Section D]\ndisplaces the beneficiary selected by the insured in ac-\ncordance with FEGLIA and places someone else in her\nstead\u201d). If the right to designate a beneficiary means\nanything, we must conclude that Section D directly con-\nflicts with FEGLIA\u2019s order of precedence.\n   The direct conflict between Section D and FEGLIA is\nalso evident in the fact that Section D\u2019s only function is to\naccomplish what Section A would have achieved, had\nSection A not been pre-empted. Section A provides that,\n    \u201cupon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce\n    from the bond of matrimony . . . , any revocable bene-\n    ficiary designation contained in a then existing writ-\n    ten contract owned by one party that provides for the\n    payment of any death benefit to the other party is re-\n    voked. A death benefit prevented from passing to\n    a former spouse by this section shall be paid as if\n    the former spouse had predeceased the decedent.\u201d Va.\n    Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A) (Lexis Cum. Supp. 2012).\nBoth parties agree that FEGLIA pre-empts this provision.\nBrief for Petitioner 4\u20135; Brief for Respondent 2; see also\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52, 722 S. E. 2d 32, 35 (2012). And for good\nreason: if an insured has designated his former spouse as\nthe beneficiary of his life insurance policy, Section A pur-\nports to \u201crevok[e]\u201d that designation in the event of divorce\nor annulment. By purporting to so alter FEGLIA\u2019s statu-\ntory order of precedence, Section A is clearly pre-empted\nby federal law. Tellingly, it is precisely in this context\u2014\nand only in this context\u2014that Section D operates. See\n4                  HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n              THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\n\u00a720\u2013111.1(D). Of course, Section D does not preclude the\ndirect payment of benefits to the designated beneficiary;\nhowever, it accomplishes the same prohibited result by\ntransforming the designated party into little more than\na passthrough for the true beneficiary. This cannot be\nsquared with FEGLIA. Consequently, Section D must\nyield.\n                       *    *    *\n  For these reasons, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion\nthat Section D is pre-empted and, therefore, concur in the\njudgment.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

JUDY A.\n\n                 MARETTA\n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       VIRGINIA\n\n                         [June 3, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.\n   I concur in the judgment. Because one of the purposes\nof the Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance Act of\n1954 (FEGLIA) is to implement the expressed wishes of\nthe insured, I would hold that a state law is pre-empted\nif it effectively overrides an insured\u2019s actual, articulated\nchoice of beneficiary. The challenged provision of Virginia\nlaw has that effect.\n   By way of background, Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(A)\n(Lexis Supp. 2012) provides that the entry of a divorce de-\ncree automatically revokes an insured\u2019s prior designa-\ntion of his or her former spouse as the beneficiary of the\npolicy. And where, as in this case, the insured remarries\nafter the divorce and dies before making a new FEGLIA\ndesignation, the proceeds, under 5 U. S. C. \u00a78705(a), are\nautomatically paid to the insured\u2019s former spouse. Under\nthe provision of Virginia law at issue here, the surviving\nspouse is entitled to recover those proceeds from the for-\nmer spouse. See Va. Code Ann. \u00a720\u2013111.1(D). Section\n20\u2013111.1(D) apparently requires this result even if the in-\nsured manifests a clear contrary intent, such as by provid-\ning specifically in a recent will that the proceeds are to go\nto another party\u2014for example, the insured\u2019s children by\nthe former marriage. Because \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) overrides the\ninsured\u2019s express intent (whether that intent is expressed\n2                   HILLMAN v. MARETTA\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nvia a beneficiary designation or through other reliable\nmeans), I agree that it is pre-empted by FEGLIA.\n   Interpreted in light of our prior decisions in Wissner v.\nWissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950), and Ridgway v. Ridgway,\n454 U. S. 46 (1981), FEGLIA seems to me to have two\nprimary purposes or objectives.\n   The first is administrative convenience. It is easier for\nan insurance administrator to pay insurance proceeds to\nthe person whom the insured has designated on a specified\nform without having to consider claims made by others\nbased on some other ground. But \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) does not\naffect the initial payment of proceeds. It operates after\nthe funds are received by the designated beneficiary, and it\nthus causes no inconvenience for those who administer the\npayment of FEGLIA proceeds.\n   The second purpose or objective is the effectuation of the\ninsured\u2019s expressed intent above all other considerations.\nThat was the basis for the decisions in Wissner and Ridg-\nway, as I understand them. In both cases, there was a\nconflict between a person whom the insured had desig-\nnated as his beneficiary and another person whose claim to\nthe proceeds was not based on the insured\u2019s expressed\nintent, and in both cases, the Court held in favor of the\ndesignated beneficiary.\n   The present case bears a similarity to Wissner and\nRidgway in that petitioner\u2019s claim depends upon a state stat-\nute that automatically alters the ultimate recipient of\na divorced employee\u2019s insurance proceeds. To be sure,\nVirginia\u2019s provision may well reflect the unexpressed\npreferences of the majority of insureds whose situations\nare similar to that of the insured in this case\u2014that is,\nindividuals who, after divorce and remarriage, fail to\nchange a prior designation of a former spouse as the bene-\nficiary of the policy. But FEGLIA prioritizes the insured\u2019s\nexpressed intent. And it is telling that, on petitioner\u2019s\ntheory, she would still be entitled to the insurance pro-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n               ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nceeds even if, for example, the insured had died shortly\nafter executing a new will leaving those proceeds to some-\none else. This shows that her claim is based on something\nother than a manifestation of the insured\u2019s intent. Be-\ncause \u00a720\u2013111.1(D) operates as a blunt tool to override the\ninsured\u2019s express declaration of his or her intent, it con-\nflicts with FEGLIA\u2019s purpose of prioritizing an insured\u2019s\narticulated wishes above all other considerations.\n   In affirming the decision below, the Court goes well\nbeyond what is necessary and opines that the party desig-\nnated as the beneficiary under a FEGLIA policy must\nbe allowed to keep the insurance proceeds even if the in-\nsured\u2019s contrary and expressed intent is indisputable\u2014for\nexample, when the insured writes a postdivorce will spe-\ncifically leaving the proceeds to someone else. See ante,\nat 11. The Court\u2019s explanation is as follows: \u201cCongress\nsought to ensure that an employee\u2019s intent would be given\neffect only through the designation of a beneficiary or\nthrough the narrow exceptions specifically provided in the\nstatute.\u201d Ibid., n. 3. In other words, Congress wanted the\ndesignated beneficiary\u2014rather than the person named\nin a later will\u2014to keep the proceeds because Congress\nwanted the named beneficiary to keep the proceeds. Need-\nless the say, this circular reasoning does not explain why\nCongress might have wanted the designated beneficiary to\nkeep the proceeds even when that is indisputably contrary\nto the insured\u2019s expressed wishes at the time of death. I\nam doubtful that any purpose or objective of FEGLIA\nwould be honored by such a holding, but it is not necessary\nto resolve that question in this case.\n   For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n</pre>",
