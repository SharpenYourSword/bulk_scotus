KING\n\n     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND\n\n     No. 12\u2013207.      Argued February 26, 2013\u2014Decided June 3, 2013\nAfter his 2009 arrest on first- and second-degree assault charges, re-\n  spondent King was processed through a Wicomico County, Maryland,\n  facility, where booking personnel used a cheek swab to take a DNA\n  sample pursuant to the Maryland DNA Collection Act (Act). The\n  swab was matched to an unsolved 2003 rape, and King was charged\n  with that crime. He moved to suppress the DNA match, arguing that\n  the Act violated the Fourth Amendment, but the Circuit Court Judge\n  found the law constitutional. King was convicted of rape. The Mary-\n  land Court of Appeals set aside the conviction, finding unconstitu-\n  tional the portions of the Act authorizing DNA collection from felony\n  arrestees.\nHeld: When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold\n for a serious offense and bring the suspect to the station to be de-\n tained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the ar-\n restee\u2019s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate\n police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth\n Amendment. Pp. 3\u201328.\n    (a) DNA testing may \u201csignificantly improve both the criminal jus-\n tice system and police investigative practices,\u201d District Attorney\u2019s Of-\n fice for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, 557 U. S. 52, 55, by making it\n \u201cpossible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect\n with near certainty,\u201d id., at 62. Maryland\u2019s Act authorizes law en-\n forcement authorities to collect DNA samples from, as relevant here,\n persons charged with violent crimes, including first-degree assault.\n A sample may not be added to a database before an individual is ar-\n raigned, and it must be destroyed if, e.g., he is not convicted. Only\n identity information may be added to the database. Here, the officer\n collected a DNA sample using the common \u201cbuccal swab\u201d procedure,\n which is quick and painless, requires no \u201csurgical intrusio[n] beneath\n2                           MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    the skin,\u201d Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753, 760, and poses no threat to\n    the arrestee\u2019s \u201chealth or safety,\u201d id., at 763. Respondent\u2019s identifica-\n    tion as the rapist resulted in part through the operation of the Com-\n    bined DNA Index System (CODIS), which connects DNA laboratories\n    at the local, state, and national level, and which standardizes the\n    points of comparison, i.e., loci, used in DNA analysis. Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The framework for deciding the issue presented is well estab-\n    lished. Using a buccal swab inside a person\u2019s cheek to obtain a DNA\n    sample is a search under the Fourth Amendment. And the fact that\n    the intrusion is negligible is of central relevance to determining\n    whether the search is reasonable, \u201cthe ultimate measure of the con-\n    stitutionality of a governmental search,\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.\n    Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 652. Because the need for a warrant is greatly\n    diminished here, where the arrestee was already in valid police cus-\n    tody for a serious offense supported by probable cause, the search is\n    analyzed by reference to \u201creasonableness, not individualized suspi-\n    cion,\u201d Samson v. California, 547 U. S. 843, 855, n. 4, and reasonable-\n    ness is determined by weighing \u201cthe promotion of legitimate govern-\n    mental interests\u201d against \u201cthe degree to which [the search] intrudes\n    upon an individual\u2019s privacy,\u201d Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n    300. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (c) In this balance of reasonableness, great weight is given to both\n    the significant government interest at stake in the identification of\n    arrestees and DNA identification\u2019s unmatched potential to serve that\n    interest. Pp. 10\u201323.\n          (1) The Act serves a well-established, legitimate government in-\n    terest: the need of law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate\n    way to process and identify persons and possessions taken into cus-\n    tody. \u201c[P]robable cause provides legal justification for arresting a\n    [suspect], and for a brief period of detention to take the administra-\n    tive steps incident to arrest,\u201d Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113\u2013\n    114; and the \u201cvalidity of the search of a person incident to a lawful\n    arrest\u201d is settled, United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224. In-\n    dividual suspicion is not necessary. The \u201croutine administrative pro-\n    cedure[s] at a police station house incident to booking and jailing the\n    suspect\u201d have different origins and different constitutional justifica-\n    tions than, say, the search of a place not incident to arrest, Illinois v.\n    Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 643, which depends on the \u201cfair probability\n    that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular\n    place,\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238. And when probable cause\n    exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society\n    and hold him in legal custody, DNA identification plays a critical role\n    in serving those interests. First, the government has an interest in\n    properly identifying \u201cwho has been arrested and who is being tried.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nHiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., 542 U. S.\n177, 191. Criminal history is critical to officers who are processing a\nsuspect for detention. They already seek identity information\nthrough routine and accepted means: comparing booking photo-\ngraphs to sketch artists\u2019 depictions, showing mugshots to potential\nwitnesses, and comparing fingerprints against electronic databases of\nknown criminals and unsolved crimes. The only difference between\nDNA analysis and fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy\nDNA provides. DNA is another metric of identification used to con-\nnect the arrestee with his or her public persona, as reflected in rec-\nords of his or her actions that are available to the police. Second, of-\nficers must ensure that the custody of an arrestee does not create\ninordinate \u201crisks for facility staff, for the existing detainee popula-\ntion, and for a new detainee.\u201d Florence v. Board of Chosen Freehold-\ners of County of Burlington, 566 U. S. ___, ___. DNA allows officers to\nknow the type of person being detained. Third, \u201cthe Government has\na substantial interest in ensuring that persons accused of crimes are\navailable for trials.\u201d Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 534. An arrestee\nmay be more inclined to flee if he thinks that continued contact with\nthe criminal justice system may expose another serious offense.\nFourth, an arrestee\u2019s past conduct is essential to assessing the dan-\nger he poses to the public, which will inform a court\u2019s bail determina-\ntion. Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a previous violent\ncrime based on DNA identification may be especially probative in this\nregard. Finally, in the interests of justice, identifying an arrestee as\nthe perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of\nfreeing a person wrongfully imprisoned. Pp. 10\u201318.\n     (2) DNA identification is an important advance in the techniques\nlong used by law enforcement to serve legitimate police concerns. Po-\nlice routinely have used scientific advancements as standard proce-\ndures for identifying arrestees. Fingerprinting, perhaps the most di-\nrect historical analogue to DNA technology, has, from its advent,\nbeen viewed as a natural part of \u201cthe administrative steps incident to\narrest.\u201d County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 58. How-\never, DNA identification is far superior. The additional intrusion up-\non the arrestee\u2019s privacy beyond that associated with fingerprinting\nis not significant, and DNA identification is markedly more accurate.\nIt may not be as fast as fingerprinting, but rapid fingerprint analysis\nis itself of recent vintage, and the question of how long it takes to\nprocess identifying information goes to the efficacy of the search for\nits purpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality of the\nsearch. Rapid technical advances are also reducing DNA processing\ntimes. Pp. 18\u201323.\n   (d) The government interest is not outweighed by respondent\u2019s pri-\n4                          MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    vacy interests. Pp. 23\u201328.\n         (1) By comparison to the substantial government interest and the\n    unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a cheek\n    swab to obtain a DNA sample is minimal. Reasonableness must be\n    considered in the context of an individual\u2019s legitimate privacy expec-\n    tations, which necessarily diminish when he is taken into police cus-\n    tody. Bell, supra, at 557. Such searches thus differ from the so-\n    called special needs searches of, e.g., otherwise law-abiding motorists\n    at checkpoints. See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32. The rea-\n    sonableness inquiry considers two other circumstances in which par-\n    ticularized suspicion is not categorically required: \u201cdiminished expec-\n    tations of privacy [and a] minimal intrusion.\u201d Illinois v. McArthur,\n    531 U. S. 326, 330. An invasive surgery may raise privacy concerns\n    weighty enough for the search to require a warrant, notwithstanding\n    the arrestee\u2019s diminished privacy expectations, but a buccal swab,\n    which involves a brief and minimal intrusion with \u201cvirtually no risk,\n    trauma, or pain,\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 771, does\n    not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of\n    arrest. Pp. 23\u201326.\n         (2) The processing of respondent\u2019s DNA sample\u2019s CODIS loci also\n    did not intrude on his privacy in a way that would make his DNA\n    identification unconstitutional. Those loci came from noncoding DNA\n    parts that do not reveal an arrestee\u2019s genetic traits and are unlikely\n    to reveal any private medical information. Even if they could provide\n    such information, they are not in fact tested for that end. Finally, the\n    Act provides statutory protections to guard against such invasions of\n    privacy.

ALONZO JAY KING, JR.\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n                     MARYLAND\n\n                                [June 3, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2003 a man concealing his face and armed with a gun\nbroke into a woman\u2019s home in Salisbury, Maryland. He\nraped her. The police were unable to identify or appre\u00ad\nhend the assailant based on any detailed description or\nother evidence they then had, but they did obtain from the\nvictim a sample of the perpetrator\u2019s DNA.\n   In 2009 Alonzo King was arrested in Wicomico County,\nMaryland, and charged with first- and second-degree\nassault for menacing a group of people with a shotgun. As\npart of a routine booking procedure for serious offenses,\nhis DNA sample was taken by applying a cotton swab or\nfilter paper\u2014known as a buccal swab\u2014to the inside of his\ncheeks. The DNA was found to match the DNA taken\nfrom the Salisbury rape victim. King was tried and con\u00ad\nvicted for the rape. Additional DNA samples were taken\nfrom him and used in the rape trial, but there seems to be\nno doubt that it was the DNA from the cheek sample\ntaken at the time he was booked in 2009 that led to his\nfirst having been linked to the rape and charged with its\ncommission.\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland, on review of King\u2019s\n2                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nrape conviction, ruled that the DNA taken when King was\nbooked for the 2009 charge was an unlawful seizure be\u00ad\ncause obtaining and using the cheek swab was an unrea\u00ad\nsonable search of the person. It set the rape conviction\naside. This Court granted certiorari and now reverses the\njudgment of the Maryland court.\n                             I\n   When King was arrested on April 10, 2009, for menac\u00ad\ning a group of people with a shotgun and charged in state\ncourt with both first- and second-degree assault, he was\nprocessed for detention in custody at the Wicomico County\nCentral Booking facility. Booking personnel used a cheek\nswab to take the DNA sample from him pursuant to provi\u00ad\nsions of the Maryland DNA Collection Act (or Act).\n   On July 13, 2009, King\u2019s DNA record was uploaded to\nthe Maryland DNA database, and three weeks later, on\nAugust 4, 2009, his DNA profile was matched to the DNA\nsample collected in the unsolved 2003 rape case. Once the\nDNA was matched to King, detectives presented the foren\u00ad\nsic evidence to a grand jury, which indicted him for the\nrape. Detectives obtained a search warrant and took a\nsecond sample of DNA from King, which again matched\nthe evidence from the rape. He moved to suppress the\nDNA match on the grounds that Maryland\u2019s DNA collec\u00ad\ntion law violated the Fourth Amendment. The Circuit\nCourt Judge upheld the statute as constitutional. King\npleaded not guilty to the rape charges but was convicted\nand sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of\nparole.\n   In a divided opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals\nstruck down the portions of the Act authorizing collection\nof DNA from felony arrestees as unconstitutional. The\nmajority concluded that a DNA swab was an unreasonable\nsearch in violation of the Fourth Amendment because\nKing\u2019s \u201cexpectation of privacy is greater than the State\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npurported interest in using King\u2019s DNA to identify him.\u201d\n425 Md. 550, 561, 42 A. 3d 549, 556 (2012). In reach-\ning that conclusion the Maryland Court relied on the deci\u00ad\nsions of various other courts that have concluded that\nDNA identification of arrestees is impermissible. See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Buza, 129 Cal. Rptr. 3d 753 (App. 2011) (offi\u00ad\ncially depublished); Mario W. v. Kaipio, 228 Ariz. 207,\n265 P. 3d 389 (App. 2011).\n   Both federal and state courts have reached differing\nconclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment prohib\u00ad\nits the collection and analysis of a DNA sample from\npersons arrested, but not yet convicted, on felony charges.\nThis Court granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to\naddress the question. King is the respondent here.\n                              II\n   The advent of DNA technology is one of the most signifi\u00ad\ncant scientific advancements of our era. The full potential\nfor use of genetic markers in medicine and science is still\nbeing explored, but the utility of DNA identification in the\ncriminal justice system is already undisputed. Since the\nfirst use of forensic DNA analysis to catch a rapist and\nmurderer in England in 1986, see J. Butler, Fundamentals\nof Forensic DNA Typing 5 (2009) (hereinafter Butler), law\nenforcement, the defense bar, and the courts have\nacknowledged DNA testing\u2019s \u201cunparalleled ability both to\nexonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty.\nIt has the potential to significantly improve both the\ncriminal justice system and police investigative practices.\u201d\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os-\nborne, 557 U. S. 52, 55 (2009).\n                             A\n   The current standard for forensic DNA testing relies on\nan analysis of the chromosomes located within the nucleus\nof all human cells. \u201cThe DNA material in chromosomes is\n4                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncomposed of \u2018coding\u2019 and \u2018noncoding\u2019 regions. The coding\nregions are known as genes and contain the information\nnecessary for a cell to make proteins. . . . Non-protein\u00ad\ncoding regions . . . are not related directly to making pro\u00ad\nteins, [and] have been referred to as \u2018junk\u2019 DNA.\u201d Butler\n25. The adjective \u201cjunk\u201d may mislead the layperson, for\nin fact this is the DNA region used with near certainty to\nidentify a person. The term apparently is intended to\nindicate that this particular noncoding region, while use\u00ad\nful and even dispositive for purposes like identity, does not\nshow more far-reaching and complex characteristics like\ngenetic traits.\n   Many of the patterns found in DNA are shared among\nall people, so forensic analysis focuses on \u201crepeated DNA\nsequences scattered throughout the human genome,\u201d\nknown as \u201cshort tandem repeats\u201d (STRs). Id., at 147\u2013148.\nThe alternative possibilities for the size and frequency of\nthese STRs at any given point along a strand of DNA are\nknown as \u201calleles,\u201d id., at 25; and multiple alleles are\nanalyzed in order to ensure that a DNA profile matches\nonly one individual. Future refinements may improve pres-\nent technology, but even now STR analysis makes it\n \u201cpossible to determine whether a biological tissue match\u00ad\nes a suspect with near certainty.\u201d Osborne, supra, at 62.\n   The Act authorizes Maryland law enforcement author\u00ad\nities to collect DNA samples from \u201can individual who is\ncharged with . . . a crime of violence or an attempt to\ncommit a crime of violence; or . . . burglary or an attempt\nto commit burglary.\u201d Md.

S.\n753, 760 (1985), and it poses no \u201cthrea[t] to the health or\n6                     MARYLAND v.

Authorized by\nCongress and supervised by the Federal Bureau of Inves\u00ad\ntigation, the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) con\u00ad\nnects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national\nlevel. Since its authorization in 1994, the CODIS system\nhas grown to include all 50 States and a number of federal\nagencies. CODIS collects DNA profiles provided by local\nlaboratories taken from arrestees, convicted offenders, and\nforensic evidence found at crime scenes. To participate\nin CODIS, a local laboratory must sign a memorandum of\nunderstanding agreeing to adhere to quality standards\nand submit to audits to evaluate compliance with the\nfederal standards for scientifically rigorous DNA testing.\nButler 270.\n   One of the most significant aspects of CODIS is the\nstandardization of the points of comparison in DNA analy\u00ad\nsis. The CODIS database is based on 13 loci at which\nthe STR alleles are noted and compared. These loci make\npossible extreme accuracy in matching individual samples,\nwith a \u201crandom match probability of approximately 1 in\n100 trillion (assuming unrelated individuals).\u201d Ibid. The\nCODIS loci are from the non-protein coding junk regions\nof DNA, and \u201care not known to have any association\nwith a genetic disease or any other genetic predisposition.\nThus, the information in the database is only useful for\nhuman identity testing.\u201d Id., at 279. STR information\nis recorded only as a \u201cstring of numbers\u201d; and the DNA\nidentification is accompanied only by information denoting\nthe laboratory and the analyst responsible for the submis\u00ad\nsion.

See Brief for Respondent 48. Twenty-eight\nStates and the Federal Government have adopted laws\nsimilar to the Maryland Act authorizing the collection of\nDNA from some or all arrestees. See Brief for State of\nCalifornia et al. as Amici Curiae 4, n. 1 (States Brief)\n(collecting state statutes). Although those statutes vary\nin their particulars, such as what charges require a DNA\nsample, their similarity means that this case implicates\nmore than the specific Maryland law. At issue is a stand\u00ad\nard, expanding technology already in widespread use\nthroughout the Nation.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   Although the DNA swab procedure used here presents a\nquestion the Court has not yet addressed, the framework\nfor deciding the issue is well established. The Fourth\nAmendment, binding on the States by the Fourteenth\nAmendment, provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\nviolated.\u201d It can be agreed that using a buccal swab on the\ninner tissues of a person\u2019s cheek in order to obtain DNA\nsamples is a search. Virtually any \u201cintrusio[n] into the\nhuman body,\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770\n(1966), will work an invasion of \u201c \u2018cherished personal secu\u00ad\nrity\u2019 that is subject to constitutional scrutiny,\u201d Cupp v.\nMurphy, 412 U. S. 291, 295 (1973) (quoting Terry v. Ohio,\n392 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1968)). The Court has applied the\nFourth Amendment to police efforts to draw blood, see\nSchmerber, supra; Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___\n8                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2013), scraping an arrestee\u2019s fingernails to obtain trace\nevidence, see Cupp, supra, and even to \u201ca breathalyzer\ntest, which generally requires the production of alveolar\nor \u2018deep lung\u2019 breath for chemical analysis,\u201d Skinner v.\nRailway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616\n(1989).\n   A buccal swab is a far more gentle process than a veni\u00ad\npuncture to draw blood. It involves but a light touch on\nthe inside of the cheek; and although it can be deemed\na search within the body of the arrestee, it requires no\n\u201csurgical intrusions beneath the skin.\u201d Winston, 470 U. S.,\nat 760. The fact than an intrusion is negligible is of cen\u00ad\ntral relevance to determining reasonableness, although it\nis still a search as the law defines that term.\n                              B\n   To say that the Fourth Amendment applies here is the\nbeginning point, not the end of the analysis. \u201c[T]he Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s proper function is to constrain, not against\nall intrusions as such, but against intrusions which are\nnot justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an\nimproper manner.\u201d Schmerber, supra, at 768. \u201cAs the text\nof the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure\nof the constitutionality of a governmental search is \u2018rea\u00ad\nsonableness.\u2019 \u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515\nU. S. 646, 652 (1995). In giving content to the inquiry\nwhether an intrusion is reasonable, the Court has pre\u00ad\nferred \u201csome quantum of individualized suspicion . . . [as]\na prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure. But\nthe Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible require\u00ad\nment of such suspicion.\u201d United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,\n428 U. S. 543, 560\u2013561 (1976) (citation and footnote\nomitted).\n   In some circumstances, such as \u201c[w]hen faced with\nspecial law enforcement needs, diminished expectations of\nprivacy, minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that certain general, or individual, circumstances\nmay render a warrantless search or seizure reasonable.\u201d\nIllinois v. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 330 (2001). Those\ncircumstances diminish the need for a warrant, either\nbecause \u201cthe public interest is such that neither a warrant\nnor probable cause is required,\u201d Maryland v. Buie, 494\nU. S. 325, 331 (1990), or because an individual is already\non notice, for instance because of his employment, see\nSkinner, supra, or the conditions of his release from gov\u00ad\nernment custody, see Samson v. California, 547 U. S. 843\n(2006), that some reasonable police intrusion on his pri\u00ad\nvacy is to be expected. The need for a warrant is perhaps\nleast when the search involves no discretion that could\nproperly be limited by the \u201cinterpo[lation of] a neutral\nmagistrate between the citizen and the law enforcement\nofficer.\u201d Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656,\n667 (1989).\n   The instant case can be addressed with this background.\nThe Maryland DNA Collection Act provides that, in order\nto obtain a DNA sample, all arrestees charged with seri\u00ad\nous crimes must furnish the sample on a buccal swab\napplied, as noted, to the inside of the cheeks. The arrestee\nis already in valid police custody for a serious offense\nsupported by probable cause. The DNA collection is not\nsubject to the judgment of officers whose perspective\nmight be \u201ccolored by their primary involvement in \u2018the\noften competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 \u201d Terry,\nsupra, at 12 (quoting Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.\n10, 14 (1948)). As noted by this Court in a different\nbut still instructive context involving blood testing, \u201c[b]oth\nthe circumstances justifying toxicological testing and the\npermissible limits of such intrusions are defined nar-\nrowly and specifically in the regulations that authorize\nthem . . . . Indeed, in light of the standardized nature of\nthe tests and the minimal discretion vested in those\ncharged with administering the program, there are virtu\u00ad\n10                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nally no facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate.\u201d Skin-\nner, supra, at 622. Here, the search effected by the buccal\nswab of respondent falls within the category of cases\nthis Court has analyzed by reference to the proposition\nthat the \u201ctouchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reason\u00ad\nableness, not individualized suspicion.\u201d Samson, supra, at\n855, n. 4.\n   Even if a warrant is not required, a search is not beyond\nFourth Amendment scrutiny; for it must be reasonable in\nits scope and manner of execution. Urgent government\ninterests are not a license for indiscriminate police behav\u00ad\nior. To say that no warrant is required is merely to\nacknowledge that \u201crather than employing a per se rule of\nunreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law\nenforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion\nwas reasonable.\u201d McArthur, supra, at 331. This applica\u00ad\ntion of \u201ctraditional standards of reasonableness\u201d requires a\ncourt to weigh \u201cthe promotion of legitimate governmen\u00ad\ntal interests\u201d against \u201cthe degree to which [the search]\nintrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d Wyoming v. Hough-\nton, 526 U. S. 295, 300 (1999). An assessment of reasona\u00ad\nbleness to determine the lawfulness of requiring this class\nof arrestees to provide a DNA sample is central to the\ninstant case.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n  The legitimate government interest served by the Mary\u00ad\nland DNA Collection Act is one that is well established:\nthe need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accu\u00ad\nrate way to process and identify the persons and posses\u00ad\nsions they must take into custody. It is beyond dispute\nthat \u201cprobable cause provides legal justification for arrest\u00ad\ning a person suspected of crime, and for a brief period of\ndetention to take the administrative steps incident to\narrest.\u201d Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113\u2013114 (1975).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAlso uncontested is the \u201cright on the part of the Govern\u00ad\nment, always recognized under English and American law,\nto search the person of the accused when legally arrested.\u201d\nWeeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914), over\u00ad\nruled on other grounds, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643\n(1961). \u201cThe validity of the search of a person incident to\na lawful arrest has been regarded as settled from its\nfirst enunciation, and has remained virtually unchallenged.\u201d\nUnited States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224 (1973).\nEven in that context, the Court has been clear that indi\u00ad\nvidual suspicion is not necessary, because \u201c[t]he constitu\u00ad\ntionality of a search incident to an arrest does not depend\non whether there is any indication that the person ar\u00ad\nrested possesses weapons or evidence. The fact of a lawful\narrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.\u201d Michigan v.\nDeFillippo, 443 U. S. 31, 35 (1979).\n   The \u201croutine administrative procedure[s] at a police sta\u00ad\ntion house incident to booking and jailing the suspect\u201d\nderive from different origins and have different constitu\u00ad\ntional justifications than, say, the search of a place, Illi-\nnois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 643 (1983); for the search\nof a place not incident to an arrest depends on the \u201cfair\nprobability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be\nfound in a particular place,\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.\n213, 238 (1983). The interests are further different when\nan individual is formally processed into police custody.\nThen \u201cthe law is in the act of subjecting the body of the\naccused to its physical dominion.\u201d People v. Chiagles, 237\nN. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923) (Cardozo, J.).\nWhen probable cause exists to remove an individual from\nthe normal channels of society and hold him in legal cus\u00ad\ntody, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving\nthose interests.\n   First, \u201c[i]n every criminal case, it is known and must be\nknown who has been arrested and who is being tried.\u201d\nHiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt\n12                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCty., 542 U. S. 177, 191 (2004). An individual\u2019s identity is\nmore than just his name or Social Security number, and\nthe government\u2019s interest in identification goes beyond\nensuring that the proper name is typed on the indictment.\nIdentity has never been considered limited to the name on\nthe arrestee\u2019s birth certificate. In fact, a name is of little\nvalue compared to the real interest in identification at\nstake when an individual is brought into custody. \u201cIt is\na well recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the per\u00ad\npetrator will take unusual steps to conceal not only his\nconduct, but also his identity. Disguises used while com\u00ad\nmitting a crime may be supplemented or replaced by\nchanged names, and even changed physical features.\u201d\nJones v. Murray, 962 F. 2d 302, 307 (CA4 1992). An \u201car\u00ad\nrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie about his identity,\u201d\nand \u201ccriminal history records . . . can be inaccurate or\nincomplete.\u201d Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of\nCounty of Burlington, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 16).\n   A suspect\u2019s criminal history is a critical part of his iden\u00ad\ntity that officers should know when processing him for\ndetention. It is a common occurrence that \u201c[p]eople de\u00ad\ntained for minor offenses can turn out to be the most\ndevious and dangerous criminals. Hours after the Okla\u00ad\nhoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a\nstate trooper who noticed he was driving without a license\nplate. Police stopped serial killer Joel Rifkin for the same\nreason. One of the terrorists involved in the September 11\nattacks was stopped and ticketed for speeding just two\ndays before hijacking Flight 93.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14) (citations omitted). Police already seek this crucial\nidentifying information. They use routine and accepted\nmeans as varied as comparing the suspect\u2019s booking pho\u00ad\ntograph to sketch artists\u2019 depictions of persons of interest,\nshowing his mugshot to potential witnesses, and of course\nmaking a computerized comparison of the arrestee\u2019s fin\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngerprints against electronic databases of known criminals\nand unsolved crimes. In this respect the only difference\nbetween DNA analysis and the accepted use of fingerprint\ndatabases is the unparalleled accuracy DNA provides.\n   The task of identification necessarily entails searching\npublic and police records based on the identifying infor\u00ad\nmation provided by the arrestee to see what is already\nknown about him. The DNA collected from arrestees is\nan irrefutable identification of the person from whom it\nwas taken. Like a fingerprint, the 13 CODIS loci are not\nthemselves evidence of any particular crime, in the way\nthat a drug test can by itself be evidence of illegal narcot\u00ad\nics use. A DNA profile is useful to the police because it\ngives them a form of identification to search the records\nalready in their valid possession. In this respect the use of\nDNA for identification is no different than matching an\narrestee\u2019s face to a wanted poster of a previously unidenti\u00ad\nfied suspect; or matching tattoos to known gang symbols\nto reveal a criminal affiliation; or matching the arrestee\u2019s\nfingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 19. DNA is another metric of identifica\u00ad\ntion used to connect the arrestee with his or her public\npersona, as reflected in records of his or her actions that\nare available to the police. Those records may be linked to\nthe arrestee by a variety of relevant forms of identifica\u00ad\ntion, including name, alias, date and time of previous\nconvictions and the name then used, photograph, Social\nSecurity number, or CODIS profile. These data, found in\nofficial records, are checked as a routine matter to produce\na more comprehensive record of the suspect\u2019s complete\nidentity. Finding occurrences of the arrestee\u2019s CODIS\nprofile in outstanding cases is consistent with this com\u00ad\nmon practice. It uses a different form of identification\nthan a name or fingerprint, but its function is the same.\n   Second, law enforcement officers bear a responsibility\nfor ensuring that the custody of an arrestee does not cre\u00ad\n14                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nate inordinate \u201crisks for facility staff, for the existing\ndetainee population, and for a new detainee.\u201d Florence,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). DNA identification can\nprovide untainted information to those charged with de\u00ad\ntaining suspects and detaining the property of any felon.\nFor these purposes officers must know the type of person\nwhom they are detaining, and DNA allows them to make\ncritical choices about how to proceed.\n     \u201cKnowledge of identity may inform an officer that a\n     suspect is wanted for another offense, or has a record\n     of violence or mental disorder. On the other hand,\n     knowing identity may help clear a suspect and al\u00ad\n     low the police to concentrate their efforts elsewhere.\n     Identity may prove particularly important in [certain\n     cases, such as] where the police are investigating\n     what appears to be a domestic assault. Officers called\n     to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom\n     they are dealing with in order to assess the situation,\n     the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to\n     the potential victim.\u201d Hiibel, supra, at 186.\nRecognizing that a name alone cannot address this inter\u00ad\nest in identity, the Court has approved, for example, \u201ca\nvisual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of\ngang affiliation as part of the intake process,\u201d because\n\u201c[t]he identification and isolation of gang members before\nthey are admitted protects everyone.\u201d Florence, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 11).\n   Third, looking forward to future stages of criminal\nprosecution, \u201cthe Government has a substantial interest in\nensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for\ntrials.\u201d Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 534 (1979). A per\u00ad\nson who is arrested for one offense but knows that he has\nyet to answer for some past crime may be more inclined to\nflee the instant charges, lest continued contact with the\ncriminal justice system expose one or more other serious\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses. For example, a defendant who had committed a\nprior sexual assault might be inclined to flee on a burglary\ncharge, knowing that in every State a DNA sample would\nbe taken from him after his conviction on the burglary\ncharge that would tie him to the more serious charge of\nrape. In addition to subverting the administration of\njustice with respect to the crime of arrest, this ties back\nto the interest in safety; for a detainee who absconds\nfrom custody presents a risk to law enforcement officers,\nother detainees, victims of previous crimes, witnesses, and\nsociety at large.\n   Fourth, an arrestee\u2019s past conduct is essential to an\nassessment of the danger he poses to the public, and this\nwill inform a court\u2019s determination whether the individual\nshould be released on bail. \u201cThe government\u2019s interest in\npreventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and com\u00ad\npelling.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 749\n(1987). DNA identification of a suspect in a violent crime\nprovides critical information to the police and judicial\nofficials in making a determination of the arrestee\u2019s future\ndangerousness. This inquiry always has entailed some\nscrutiny beyond the name on the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense. For example, Maryland law requires a judge to\ntake into account not only \u201cthe nature and circumstances\nof the offense charged\u201d but also \u201cthe defendant\u2019s family\nties, employment status and history, financial resources,\nreputation, character and mental condition, length of res\u00ad\nidence in the community.\u201d 1 Md. Rules 4\u2013216(f)(1)(A),\n(C) (2013). Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a\nprevious violent crime based on DNA identification is\nespecially probative of the court\u2019s consideration of \u201cthe\ndanger of the defendant to the alleged victim, another\nperson, or the community.\u201d        Rule 4\u2013216(f)(1)(G); see\nalso 18 U. S. C. \u00a73142 (2006 ed. and Supp. V) (similar\nrequirements).\n   This interest is not speculative. In considering laws to\n16                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire collecting DNA from arrestees, government agen\u00ad\ncies around the Nation found evidence of numerous\ncases in which felony arrestees would have been identified\nas violent through DNA identification matching them\nto previous crimes but who later committed additional\ncrimes because such identification was not used to detain\nthem.

See, e.g., States Brief 18, n. 10 (\u201cDNA iden\u00ad\ntification database samples have been processed in as few\nas two days in California, although around 30 days has\nbeen average\u201d). Regardless of when the initial bail deci\u00ad\nsion is made, release is not appropriate until a further\ndetermination is made as to the person\u2019s identity in the\nsense not only of what his birth certificate states but also\nwhat other records and data disclose to give that identity\nmore meaning in the whole context of who the person\nreally is. And even when release is permitted, the back\u00ad\nground identity of the suspect is necessary for determining\nwhat conditions must be met before release is allowed. If\nrelease is authorized, it may take time for the conditions\nto be met, and so the time before actual release can be\nsubstantial.

During this entire period, ad\u00ad\nditional and supplemental data establishing more about\nthe person\u2019s identity and background can provide critical\ninformation relevant to the conditions of release and\nwhether to revisit an initial release determination. The\nfacts of this case are illustrative. Though the record is not\nclear, if some thought were being given to releasing the\nrespondent on bail on the gun charge, a release that would\ntake weeks or months in any event, when the DNA report\nlinked him to the prior rape, it would be relevant to the\nconditions of his release. The same would be true with a\nsupplemental fingerprint report.\n    Even if an arrestee is released on bail, development of\nDNA identification revealing the defendant\u2019s unknown\nviolent past can and should lead to the revocation of his\nconditional release. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73145(a) (providing for\nrevocation of release); see also States Brief 11\u201312 (discuss\u00ad\ning examples where bail and diversion determinations\nwere reversed after DNA identified the arrestee\u2019s vio\u00ad\nlent history). Pretrial release of a person charged with a\ndangerous crime is a most serious responsibility. It is reason\u00ad\nable in all respects for the State to use an accepted data\u00ad\nbase to determine if an arrestee is the object of suspicion\nin other serious crimes, suspicion that may provide a\nstrong incentive for the arrestee to escape and flee.\n    Finally, in the interests of justice, the identification of\nan arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may\nhave the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully\nimprisoned for the same offense. \u201c[P]rompt [DNA] testing\n. . . would speed up apprehension of criminals before they\ncommit additional crimes, and prevent the grotesque\n18                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ndetention of . . . innocent people.\u201d J. Dwyer, P. Neufeld, &\nB. Scheck, Actual Innocence 245 (2000).\n   Because proper processing of arrestees is so important\nand has consequences for every stage of the criminal\nprocess, the Court has recognized that the \u201cgovernmen-\ntal interests underlying a station-house search of the ar\u00ad\nrestee\u2019s person and possessions may in some circumstances\nbe even greater than those supporting a search imme\u00ad\ndiately following arrest.\u201d Lafayette, 462 U. S., at 645.\nThus, the Court has been reluctant to circumscribe the\nauthority of the police to conduct reasonable booking\nsearches. For example, \u201c[t]he standards traditionally\ngoverning a search incident to lawful arrest are not . . .\ncommuted to the stricter Terry standards.\u201d Robinson,\n414 U. S., at 234. Nor are these interests in identifica-\ntion served only by a search of the arrestee himself.\n\u201c[I]nspection of an arrestee\u2019s personal property may assist\nthe police in ascertaining or verifying his identity.\u201d Lafa-\nyette, supra, at 646. And though the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nprotection against self-incrimination is not, as a general\nrule, governed by a reasonableness standard, the Court\nhas held that \u201cquestions . . . reasonably related to the\npolice\u2019s administrative concerns . . . fall outside the protec\u00ad\ntions of Miranda [v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)] and the\nanswers thereto need not be suppressed.\u201d Pennsylvania v.\nMuniz, 496 U. S. 582, 601\u2013602 (1990).\n                            B\n  DNA identification represents an important advance\nin the techniques used by law enforcement to serve le\u00ad\ngitimate police concerns for as long as there have been\narrests, concerns the courts have acknowledged and ap\u00ad\nproved for more than a century.        Law enforcement\nagencies routinely have used scientific advancements in\ntheir standard procedures for the identification of ar\u00ad\nrestees. \u201cPolice had been using photography to capture\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe faces of criminals almost since its invention.\u201d S. Cole,\nSuspect Identities 20 (2001). Courts did not dispute that\npractice, concluding that a \u201csheriff in making an arrest for\na felony on a warrant has the right to exercise a discretion\n. . . , [if] he should deem it necessary to the safe-keeping of\na prisoner, and to prevent his escape, or to enable him the\nmore readily to retake the prisoner if he should escape, to\ntake his photograph.\u201d State ex rel. Bruns v. Clausmier,\n154 Ind. 599, 601, 603, 57 N. E. 541, 542 (1900). By the\ntime that it had become \u201cthe daily practice of the police\nofficers and detectives of crime to use photographic pic\u00ad\ntures for the discovery and identification of criminals,\u201d the\ncourts likewise had come to the conclusion that \u201cit would\nbe [a] matter of regret to have its use unduly restricted\nupon any fanciful theory or constitutional privilege.\u201d\nShaffer v. United States, 24 App. D. C. 417, 426 (1904).\n    Beginning in 1887, some police adopted more exacting\nmeans to identify arrestees, using the system of precise\nphysical measurements pioneered by the French anthro\u00ad\npologist Alphonse Bertillon. Bertillon identification con\u00ad\nsisted of 10 measurements of the arrestee\u2019s body, along\nwith a \u201cscientific analysis of the features of the face and\nan exact anatomical localization of the various scars,\nmarks, &c., of the body.\u201d Defense of the Bertillon System,\nN. Y. Times, Jan. 20, 1896, p. 3. \u201c[W]hen a prisoner was\nbrought in, his photograph was taken according to the\nBertillon system, and his body measurements were then\nmade. The measurements were made . . . and noted down\non the back of a card or a blotter, and the photograph of\nthe prisoner was expected to be placed on the card. This\ncard, therefore, furnished both the likeness and descrip\u00ad\ntion of the prisoner, and was placed in the rogues\u2019 gallery,\nand copies were sent to various cities where similar rec\u00ad\nords were kept.\u201d People ex rel. Jones v. Diehl, 53 App. Div.\n645, 646, 65 N. Y. S. 801, 802 (1900). As in the present\ncase, the point of taking this information about each ar\u00ad\n20                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrestee was not limited to verifying that the proper name\nwas on the indictment. These procedures were used to\n\u201cfacilitate the recapture of escaped prisoners,\u201d to aid \u201cthe\ninvestigation of their past records and personal history,\u201d\nand \u201cto preserve the means of identification for . . . fu-\nture supervision after discharge.\u201d Hodgeman v. Olsen, 86\nWash. 615, 619, 150 P. 1122, 1124 (1915); see also McGov-\nern v. Van Riper, 137 N. J. Eq. 24, 33\u201334, 43 A. 2d 514,\n519 (Ch. 1945) (\u201c[C]riminal identification is said to have\ntwo main purposes: (1) The identification of the accused as\nthe person who committed the crime for which he is being\nheld; and, (2) the identification of the accused as the same\nperson who has been previously charged with, or convicted\nof, other offenses against the criminal law\u201d).\n   Perhaps the most direct historical analogue to the DNA\ntechnology used to identify respondent is the familiar\npractice of fingerprinting arrestees. From the advent of\nthis technique, courts had no trouble determining that\nfingerprinting was a natural part of \u201cthe administrative\nsteps incident to arrest.\u201d County of Riverside v. McLaugh-\nlin, 500 U. S. 44, 58 (1991). In the seminal case of United\nStates v. Kelly, 55 F. 2d 67 (CA2 1932), Judge Augustus\nHand wrote that routine fingerprinting did not violate the\nFourth Amendment precisely because it fit within the\naccepted means of processing an arrestee into custody:\n        \u201cFinger printing seems to be no more than an exten\u00ad\n     sion of methods of identification long used in dealing\n     with persons under arrest for real or supposed vio\u00ad\n     lations of the criminal laws. It is known to be a very\n     certain means devised by modern science to reach the\n     desired end, and has become especially important in a\n     time when increased population and vast aggrega\u00ad\n     tions of people in urban centers have rendered the no\u00ad\n     toriety of the individual in the community no longer a\n     ready means of identification.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             21\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n        .           .               .             .     .\n      \u201cWe find no ground in reason or authority for inter\u00ad\n    fering with a method of identifying persons charged\n    with crime which has now become widely known and\n    frequently practiced.\u201d Id., at 69\u201370.\nBy the middle of the 20th century, it was considered \u201cele\u00ad\nmentary that a person in lawful custody may be required\nto submit to photographing and fingerprinting as part of\nroutine identification processes.\u201d Smith v. United States,\n324 F. 2d 879, 882 (CADC 1963) (Burger, J.) (citations\nomitted).\n   DNA identification is an advanced technique superior to\nfingerprinting in many ways, so much so that to insist on\nfingerprints as the norm would make little sense to either\nthe forensic expert or a layperson. The additional intru\u00ad\nsion upon the arrestee\u2019s privacy beyond that associated\nwith fingerprinting is not significant, see Part V, infra,\nand DNA is a markedly more accurate form of identifying\narrestees. A suspect who has changed his facial features\nto evade photographic identification or even one who has\nundertaken the more arduous task of altering his finger\u00ad\nprints cannot escape the revealing power of his DNA.\n   The respondent\u2019s primary objection to this analogy is\nthat DNA identification is not as fast as fingerprinting,\nand so it should not be considered to be the 21st-century\nequivalent. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 53. But rapid analysis of\nfingerprints is itself of recent vintage. The FBI\u2019s vaunted\nIntegrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System\n(IAFIS) was only \u201claunched on July 28, 1999. Prior to this\ntime, the processing of . . . fingerprint submissions was\nlargely a manual, labor-intensive process, taking weeks or\nmonths to process a single submission.\u201d Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identifi\u00ad\ncation System, online at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/\nfingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis. It was not the advent of\n22                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis technology that rendered fingerprint analysis consti\u00ad\ntutional in a single moment. The question of how long it\ntakes to process identifying information obtained from a\nvalid search goes only to the efficacy of the search for its\npurpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality\nof the search. Cf. Ontario v. Quon, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 15). Given the importance of DNA in\nthe identification of police records pertaining to arrestees\nand the need to refine and confirm that identity for its\nimportant bearing on the decision to continue release on\nbail or to impose of new conditions, DNA serves an essen\u00ad\ntial purpose despite the existence of delays such as the\none that occurred in this case. Even so, the delay in\nprocessing DNA from arrestees is being reduced to a sub\u00ad\nstantial degree by rapid technical advances. See, e.g., At\u00ad\ntorney General DeWine Announces Significant Drop in DNA\nTurnaround Time (Jan. 4, 2013) (DNA processing time\nreduced from 125 days in 2010 to 20 days in 2012), online at\nhttp://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/January-\n2013/Attorney- General - DeWine -Announces- Significant-\nDrop; Gov. Jindal Announces Elimination of DNA\nBacklog, DNA Unit Now Operating in Real Time (Nov. 17,\n2011) (average DNA report time reduced from a year\nor more in 2009 to 20 days in 2011), online at http://\nwww.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail\n&articleID=3102. And the FBI has already begun testing\ndevices that will enable police to process the DNA of ar\u00ad\nrestees within 90 minutes. See Brief for National District\nAttorneys Association as Amicus Curiae 20\u201321; Tr. of Oral\nArg. 17. An assessment and understanding of the reason\u00ad\nableness of this minimally invasive search of a person\ndetained for a serious crime should take account of these\ntechnical advances. Just as fingerprinting was constitu\u00ad\ntional for generations prior to the introduction of IAFIS,\nDNA identification of arrestees is a permissible tool of law\nenforcement today. New technology will only further\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimprove its speed and therefore its effectiveness. And, as\nnoted above, actual release of a serious offender as a rou\u00ad\ntine matter takes weeks or months in any event. By iden\u00ad\ntifying not only who the arrestee is but also what other\navailable records disclose about his past to show who he is,\nthe police can ensure that they have the proper person\nunder arrest and that they have made the necessary\narrangements for his custody; and, just as important, they\ncan also prevent suspicion against or prosecution of the\ninnocent.\n   In sum, there can be little reason to question \u201cthe legit\u00ad\nimate interest of the government in knowing for an abso\u00ad\nlute certainty the identity of the person arrested, in\nknowing whether he is wanted elsewhere, and in ensuring\nhis identification in the event he flees prosecution.\u201d 3 W.\nLaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a75.3(c), p. 216 (5th ed. 2012).\nTo that end, courts have confirmed that the Fourth\nAmendment allows police to take certain routine \u201cadmin\u00ad\nistrative steps incident to arrest\u2014i.e., . . . book[ing], pho\u00ad\ntograph[ing], and fingerprint[ing].\u201d      McLaughlin, 500\nU. S., at 58. DNA identification of arrestees, of the type\napproved by the Maryland statute here at issue, is \u201cno\nmore than an extension of methods of identification long\nused in dealing with persons under arrest.\u201d Kelly, 55\nF. 2d, at 69. In the balance of reasonableness required by\nthe Fourth Amendment, therefore, the Court must give\ngreat weight both to the significant government interest at\nstake in the identification of arrestees and to the un\u00ad\nmatched potential of DNA identification to serve that\ninterest.\n                           V\n\n                           A\n\n  By comparison to this substantial government interest\nand the unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the\nintrusion of a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is a\n24                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminimal one. True, a significant government interest does\nnot alone suffice to justify a search. The government\ninterest must outweigh the degree to which the search in\u00ad\nvades an individual\u2019s legitimate expectations of privacy.\nIn considering those expectations in this case, however,\nthe necessary predicate of a valid arrest for a serious\noffense is fundamental. \u201cAlthough the underlying com\u00ad\nmand of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches\nand seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on\nthe context within which a search takes place.\u201d New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 337 (1985). \u201c[T]he legiti\u00ad\nmacy of certain privacy expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the State\nmay depend upon the individual\u2019s legal relationship with\nthe State.\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515 U. S., at 654.\n   The reasonableness of any search must be considered\nin the context of the person\u2019s legitimate expectations of\nprivacy. For example, when weighing the invasiveness of\nurinalysis of high school athletes, the Court noted that\n\u201c[l]egitimate privacy expectations are even less with re\u00ad\ngard to student athletes. . . . Public school locker rooms,\nthe usual sites for these activities, are not notable for the\nprivacy they afford.\u201d Id., at 657. Likewise, the Court\nhas used a context-specific benchmark inapplicable to the\npublic at large when \u201cthe expectations of privacy of cov\u00ad\nered employees are diminished by reason of their participa\u00ad\ntion in an industry that is regulated pervasively,\u201d Skinner,\n489 U. S., at 627, or when \u201cthe \u2018operational realities of\nthe workplace\u2019 may render entirely reasonable certain\nwork-related intrusions by supervisors and co-workers\nthat might be viewed as unreasonable in other contexts,\u201d\nVon Raab, 489 U. S., at 671.\n   The expectations of privacy of an individual taken into\npolice custody \u201cnecessarily [are] of a diminished scope.\u201d\nBell, 441 U. S., at 557. \u201c[B]oth the person and the property\nin his immediate possession may be searched at the\nstation house.\u201d United States v. Edwards, 415 U. S. 800,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n803 (1974). A search of the detainee\u2019s person when he is\nbooked into custody may \u201c \u2018involve a relatively extensive\nexploration,\u2019 \u201d Robinson, 414 U. S., at 227, including \u201cre\u00ad\nquir[ing] at least some detainees to lift their genitals or\ncough in a squatting position,\u201d Florence, 566 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13).\n   In this critical respect, the search here at issue differs\nfrom the sort of programmatic searches of either the public\nat large or a particular class of regulated but otherwise\nlaw-abiding citizens that the Court has previously labeled\nas \u201c \u2018special needs\u2019 \u201d searches. Chandler v. Miller, 520\nU. S. 305, 314 (1997). When the police stop a motorist at\na checkpoint, see Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32\n(2000), or test a political candidate for illegal narcotics, see\nChandler, supra, they intrude upon substantial expecta\u00ad\ntions of privacy. So the Court has insisted on some pur\u00ad\npose other than \u201cto detect evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing\u201d to justify these searches in the absence of\nindividualized suspicion. Edmond, supra, at 38. Once an\nindividual has been arrested on probable cause for a dan\u00ad\ngerous offense that may require detention before trial,\nhowever, his or her expectations of privacy and freedom\nfrom police scrutiny are reduced. DNA identification like\nthat at issue here thus does not require consideration of\nany unique needs that would be required to justify search\u00ad\ning the average citizen. The special needs cases, though\nin full accord with the result reached here, do not have a\ndirect bearing on the issues presented in this case, be\u00ad\ncause unlike the search of a citizen who has not been\nsuspected of a wrong, a detainee has a reduced expectation\nof privacy.\n   The reasonableness inquiry here considers two other\ncircumstances in which the Court has held that particular\u00ad\nized suspicion is not categorically required: \u201cdiminished\nexpectations of privacy [and] minimal intrusions.\u201d McAr-\nthur, 531 U. S., at 330. This is not to suggest that any\n26                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsearch is acceptable solely because a person is in custody.\nSome searches, such as invasive surgery, see Winston, 470\nU. S. 753, or a search of the arrestee\u2019s home, see Chimel v.\nCalifornia, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), involve either greater\nintrusions or higher expectations of privacy than are\npresent in this case. In those situations, when the Court\nmust \u201cbalance the privacy-related and law enforcement\u00ad\nrelated concerns to determine if the intrusion was rea\u00ad\nsonable,\u201d McArthur, supra, at 331, the privacy-related\nconcerns are weighty enough that the search may require a\nwarrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of\nprivacy of the arrestee.\n  Here, by contrast to the approved standard procedures\nincident to any arrest detailed above, a buccal swab in\u00ad\nvolves an even more brief and still minimal intrusion. A\ngentle rub along the inside of the cheek does not break the\nskin, and it \u201cinvolves virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.\u201d\nSchmerber, 384 U. S., at 771. \u201cA crucial factor in analyz\u00ad\ning the magnitude of the intrusion . . . is the extent to\nwhich the procedure may threaten the safety or health of\nthe individual,\u201d Winston, supra, at 761, and nothing sug\u00ad\ngests that a buccal swab poses any physical danger what\u00ad\nsoever. A brief intrusion of an arrestee\u2019s person is subject\nto the Fourth Amendment, but a swab of this nature does\nnot increase the indignity already attendant to normal\nincidents of arrest.\n                             B\n  In addition the processing of respondent\u2019s DNA sam\u00ad\nple\u2019s 13 CODIS loci did not intrude on respondent\u2019s privacy\nin a way that would make his DNA identification\nunconstitutional.\n  First, as already noted, the CODIS loci come from non\u00ad\ncoding parts of the DNA that do not reveal the genetic\ntraits of the arrestee. While science can always progress\nfurther, and those progressions may have Fourth Amend\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment consequences, alleles at the CODIS loci \u201care not\nat present revealing information beyond identification.\u201d\nKatsanis & Wagner, Characterization of the Standard and\nRecommended CODIS Markers, 58 J. Forensic Sci. S169,\nS171 (2013). The argument that the testing at issue in\nthis case reveals any private medical information at all is\nopen to dispute.\n   And even if non-coding alleles could provide some in\u00ad\nformation, they are not in fact tested for that end. It is\nundisputed that law enforcement officers analyze DNA for\nthe sole purpose of generating a unique identifying num\u00ad\nber against which future samples may be matched. This\nparallels a similar safeguard based on actual practice in\nthe school drug-testing context, where the Court deemed it\n\u201csignificant that the tests at issue here look only for drugs,\nand not for whether the student is, for example, epileptic,\npregnant, or diabetic.\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515\nU. S., at 658. If in the future police analyze samples to\ndetermine, for instance, an arrestee\u2019s predisposition for a\nparticular disease or other hereditary factors not relevant\nto identity, that case would present additional privacy\nconcerns not present here.\n   Finally, the Act provides statutory protections that\nguard against further invasion of privacy. As noted above,\nthe Act requires that \u201c[o]nly DNA records that directly\nrelate to the identification of individuals shall be collected\nand stored.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \u00a72\u2013505(b)(1). No\npurpose other than identification is permissible: \u201cA person\nmay not willfully test a DNA sample for information that\ndoes not relate to the identification of individuals as speci\u00ad\nfied in this subtitle.\u201d \u00a72\u2013512(c). This Court has noted\noften that \u201ca \u2018statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwar\u00ad\nranted disclosures\u2019 generally allays . . . privacy concerns.\u201d\nNASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 20)\n(quoting Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 605 (1977)). The\nCourt need not speculate about the risks posed \u201cby a\n28                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsystem that did not contain comparable security provi\u00ad\nsions.\u201d Id., at 606. In light of the scientific and statutory\nsafeguards, once respondent\u2019s DNA was lawfully collected\nthe STR analysis of respondent\u2019s DNA pursuant to CODIS\nprocedures did not amount to a significant invasion of\nprivacy that would render the DNA identification imper\u00ad\nmissible under the Fourth Amendment.\n                         *    *     *\n   In light of the context of a valid arrest supported by\nprobable cause respondent\u2019s expectations of privacy were\nnot offended by the minor intrusion of a brief swab of his\ncheeks. By contrast, that same context of arrest gives rise\nto significant state interests in identifying respondent not\nonly so that the proper name can be attached to his charges\nbut also so that the criminal justice system can make\ninformed decisions concerning pretrial custody. Upon\nthese considerations the Court concludes that DNA identi\u00ad\nfication of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be\nconsidered part of a routine booking procedure. When\nofficers make an arrest supported by probable cause to\nhold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the\nstation to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a\ncheek swab of the arrestee\u2019s DNA is, like fingerprinting\nand photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure\nthat is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is\nreversed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

That prohibition is categorical and with-\nout exception; it lies at the very heart of the Fourth\nAmendment. Whenever this Court has allowed a suspi-\ncionless search, it has insisted upon a justifying motive\napart from the investigation of crime.\n  It is obvious that no such noninvestigative motive exists\nin this case. The Court\u2019s assertion that DNA is being\ntaken, not to solve crimes, but to identify those in the\nState\u2019s custody, taxes the credulity of the credulous. And\nthe Court\u2019s comparison of Maryland\u2019s DNA searches to\nother techniques, such as fingerprinting, can seem apt\nonly to those who know no more than today\u2019s opinion\nhas chosen to tell them about how those DNA searches\nactually work.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  At the time of the Founding, Americans despised the\nBritish use of so-called \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d\u2014warrants not\ngrounded upon a sworn oath of a specific infraction by a\nparticular individual, and thus not limited in scope and\n2                    MARYLAND v.

See Chandler v. Miller, 520\nU.

Railway\nLabor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 619 (1989) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). Even the common name for\nsuspicionless searches\u2014\u201cspecial needs\u201d searches\u2014itself\nreflects that they must be justified, always, by concerns\n\u201cother than crime detection.\u201d Chandler, supra, at 313\u2013\n314. We have approved random drug tests of railroad\nemployees, yes\u2014but only because the Government\u2019s need\nto \u201cregulat[e] the conduct of railroad employees to ensure\nsafety\u201d is distinct from \u201cnormal law enforcement.\u201d Skin-\nner, supra, at 620.

Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 665\n(1995).\n    So while the Court is correct to note (ante, at 8\u20139) that\nthere are instances in which we have permitted searches\nwithout individualized suspicion, \u201c[i]n none of these cases\n. . . did we indicate approval of a [search] whose primary\npurpose was to detect evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing.\u201d Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32, 38\n(2000). That limitation is crucial. It is only when a gov-\nernmental purpose aside from crime-solving is at stake\nthat we engage in the free-form \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry\nthat the Court indulges at length today. To put it another\nway, both the legitimacy of the Court\u2019s method and the\ncorrectness of its outcome hinge entirely on the truth of a\nsingle proposition: that the primary purpose of these DNA\n4                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsearches is something other than simply discovering evi-\ndence of criminal wrongdoing. As I detail below, that\nproposition is wrong.\n                                B\n  The Court alludes at several points (see ante, at 11, 25)\nto the fact that King was an arrestee, and arrestees may\nbe validly searched incident to their arrest. But the Court\ndoes not really rest on this principle, and for good reason:\nThe objects of a search incident to arrest must be either (1)\nweapons or evidence that might easily be destroyed, or (2)\nevidence relevant to the crime of arrest. See Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. 332, 343\u2013344 (2009); Thornton v. United\nStates, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). Neither is the object of the search at issue\nhere.\n  The Court hastens to clarify that it does not mean to\napprove invasive surgery on arrestees or warrantless\nsearches of their homes. Ante, at 25. That the Court feels\nthe need to disclaim these consequences is as damning a\ncriticism of its suspicionless-search regime as any I can\nmuster. And the Court\u2019s attempt to distinguish those\nhypothetical searches from this real one is unconvincing.\nWe are told that the \u201cprivacy-related concerns\u201d in the\nsearch of a home \u201care weighty enough that the search may\nrequire a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expec-\ntations of privacy of the arrestee.\u201d Ante, at 26. But why\nare the \u201cprivacy-related concerns\u201d not also \u201cweighty\u201d when\nan intrusion into the body is at stake? (The Fourth\nAmendment lists \u201cpersons\u201d first among the entities pro-\ntected against unreasonable searches and seizures.) And\ncould the police engage, without any suspicion of wrongdo-\ning, in a \u201cbrief and . . . minimal\u201d intrusion into the home of\nan arrestee\u2014perhaps just peeking around the curtilage a\nbit? See ante, at 26. Obviously not.\n  At any rate, all this discussion is beside the point. No\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      5\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmatter the degree of invasiveness, suspicionless searches\nare never allowed if their principal end is ordinary crime-\nsolving. A search incident to arrest either serves other\nends (such as officer safety, in a search for weapons) or\nis not suspicionless (as when there is reason to believe\nthe arrestee possesses evidence relevant to the crime of\narrest).\n   Sensing (correctly) that it needs more, the Court elabo-\nrates at length the ways that the search here served the\nspecial purpose of \u201cidentifying\u201d King.1 But that seems to\nme quite wrong\u2014unless what one means by \u201cidentifying\u201d\nsomeone is \u201csearching for evidence that he has committed\ncrimes unrelated to the crime of his arrest.\u201d At points the\nCourt does appear to use \u201cidentifying\u201d in that peculiar\nsense\u2014claiming, for example, that knowing \u201can arrestee\u2019s\npast conduct is essential to an assessment of the danger\nhe poses.\u201d Ante, at 15. If identifying someone means\nfinding out what unsolved crimes he has committed, then\nidentification is indistinguishable from the ordinary law-\nenforcement aims that have never been thought to justify\na suspicionless search. Searching every lawfully stopped\ncar, for example, might turn up information about un-\nsolved crimes the driver had committed, but no one would\nsay that such a search was aimed at \u201cidentifying\u201d him, and\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court\u2019s insistence (ante, at 25) that our special-needs cases \u201cdo\nnot have a direct bearing on the issues presented in this case\u201d is per-\nplexing. Why spill so much ink on the special need of identification if a\nspecial need is not required? Why not just come out and say that any\nsuspicionless search of an arrestee is allowed if it will be useful to solve\ncrimes? The Court does not say that because most Members of the\nCourt do not believe it. So whatever the Court\u2019s major premise\u2014the\nopinion does not really contain what you would call a rule of decision\u2014\nthe minor premise is \u201cthis search was used to identify King.\u201d The\nincorrectness of that minor premise will therefore suffice to demon-\nstrate the error in the Court\u2019s result.\n6                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno court would hold such a search lawful. I will therefore\nassume that the Court means that the DNA search at\nissue here was useful to \u201cidentify\u201d King in the normal\nsense of that word\u2014in the sense that would identify the\nauthor of Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation as Jeremy Bentham.\n                              1\n   The portion of the Court\u2019s opinion that explains the\nidentification rationale is strangely silent on the actual\nworkings of the DNA search at issue here. To know those\nfacts is to be instantly disabused of the notion that what\nhappened had anything to do with identifying King.\n   King was arrested on April 10, 2009, on charges unre-\nlated to the case before us. That same day, April 10, the\npolice searched him and seized the DNA evidence at issue\nhere. What happened next? Reading the Court\u2019s opinion,\nparticularly its insistence that the search was necessary to\nknow \u201cwho [had] been arrested,\u201d ante, at 11, one might\nguess that King\u2019s DNA was swiftly processed and his\nidentity thereby confirmed\u2014perhaps against some master\ndatabase of known DNA profiles, as is done for finger-\nprints. After all, was not the suspicionless search here\ncrucial to avoid \u201cinordinate risks for facility staff\u201d or to\n\u201cexisting detainee population,\u201d ante, at 14? Surely, then\u2014\nsurely\u2014the State of Maryland got cracking on those grave\nrisks immediately, by rushing to identify King with his\nDNA as soon as possible.\n   Nothing could be further from the truth. Maryland\nofficials did not even begin the process of testing King\u2019s\nDNA that day. Or, actually, the next day. Or the day\nafter that. And that was for a simple reason: Maryland\nlaw forbids them to do so. A \u201cDNA sample collected from\nan individual charged with a crime . . . may not be tested\nor placed in the statewide DNA data base system prior to\nthe first scheduled arraignment date.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf. Code\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nAnn. \u00a72\u2013504(d)(1) (Lexis 2011) (emphasis added). And\nKing\u2019s first appearance in court was not until three days\nafter his arrest. (I suspect, though, that they did not wait\nthree days to ask his name or take his fingerprints.)\n  This places in a rather different light the Court\u2019s solemn\ndeclaration that the search here was necessary so that\nKing could be identified at \u201cevery stage of the criminal\nprocess.\u201d Ante, at 18. I hope that the Maryland officials\nwho read the Court\u2019s opinion do not take it seriously.\nActing on the Court\u2019s misperception of Maryland law could\nlead to jail time. See Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \u00a72\u2013512(c)\u2013(e)\n(punishing by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment anyone who\nobtains or tests DNA information except as provided by\nstatute). Does the Court really believe that Maryland\ndid not know whom it was arraigning? The Court\u2019s re-\nsponse is to imagine that release on bail could take so long\nthat the DNA results are returned in time, or perhaps that\nbail could be revoked if the DNA test turned up incrimi-\nnating information. Ante, at 16\u201317. That is no answer at\nall. If the purpose of this Act is to assess \u201cwhether [King]\nshould be released on bail,\u201d ante, at 15, why would it\npossibly forbid the DNA testing process to begin until King\nwas arraigned? Why would Maryland resign itself to\nsimply hoping that the bail decision will drag out long\nenough that the \u201cidentification\u201d can succeed before the\narrestee is released? The truth, known to Maryland and\nincreasingly to the reader: this search had nothing to do\nwith establishing King\u2019s identity.\n  It gets worse. King\u2019s DNA sample was not received by\nthe Maryland State Police\u2019s Forensic Sciences Division\nuntil April 23, 2009\u2014two weeks after his arrest. It sat in\nthat office, ripening in a storage area, until the custodians\ngot around to mailing it to a lab for testing on June 25,\n2009\u2014two months after it was received, and nearly three\nsince King\u2019s arrest. After it was mailed, the data from the\nlab tests were not available for several more weeks, until\n8                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nJuly 13, 2009, which is when the test results were entered\ninto Maryland\u2019s DNA database, together with information\nidentifying the person from whom the sample was taken.\nMeanwhile, bail had been set, King had engaged in dis-\ncovery, and he had requested a speedy trial\u2014presumably\nnot a trial of John Doe. It was not until August 4, 2009\u2014\nfour months after King\u2019s arrest\u2014that the forwarded sam-\nple transmitted (without identifying information) from the\nMaryland DNA database to the Federal Bureau of Investi-\ngation\u2019s national database was matched with a sample\ntaken from the scene of an unrelated crime years earlier.\n   A more specific description of exactly what happened at\nthis point illustrates why, by definition, King could\nnot have been identified by this match. The FBI\u2019s\nDNA database (known as CODIS) consists of two distinct\ncollections. FBI, CODIS and NDIS Fact Sheet, http://\nwww.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet\n(all Internet materials as visited May 31, 2013, and avail-\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). One of them, the one to\nwhich King\u2019s DNA was submitted, consists of DNA sam-\nples taken from known convicts or arrestees. I will refer\nto this as the \u201cConvict and Arrestee Collection.\u201d The other\ncollection consists of samples taken from crime scenes; I\nwill refer to this as the \u201cUnsolved Crimes Collection.\u201d The\nConvict and Arrestee Collection stores \u201cno names or other\npersonal identifiers of the offenders, arrestees, or detain-\nees.\u201d Ibid. Rather, it contains only the DNA profile itself,\nthe name of the agency that submitted it, the laboratory\npersonnel who analyzed it, and an identification number\nfor the specimen. Ibid. This is because the submitting\nstate laboratories are expected already to know the identi-\nties of the convicts and arrestees from whom samples are\ntaken. (And, of course, they do.)\n   Moreover, the CODIS system works by checking to see\nwhether any of the samples in the Unsolved Crimes Col-\nlection match any of the samples in the Convict and Ar-\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

That is sensible, if what one\nwants to do is solve those cold cases, but note what it\nrequires: that the identity of the people whose DNA has\nbeen entered in the Convict and Arrestee Collection al-\nready be known.2 If one wanted to identify someone in\ncustody using his DNA, the logical thing to do would be to\ncompare that DNA against the Convict and Arrestee\nCollection: to search, in other words, the collection that\ncould be used (by checking back with the submitting\nstate agency) to identify people, rather than the collection\nof evidence from unsolved crimes, whose perpetrators are\nby definition unknown. But that is not what was done.\nAnd that is because this search had nothing to do with\nidentification.\n  In fact, if anything was \u201cidentified\u201d at the moment that\nthe DNA database returned a match, it was not King\u2014his\nidentity was already known. (The docket for the original\ncriminal charges lists his full name, his race, his sex, his\nheight, his weight, his date of birth, and his address.)\nRather, what the August 4 match \u201cidentified\u201d was the\npreviously-taken sample from the earlier crime. That\nsample was genuinely mysterious to Maryland; the State\nknew that it had probably been left by the victim\u2019s attack-\ner, but nothing else. King was not identified by his associ-\nation with the sample; rather, the sample was identified\nby its association with King. The Court effectively de-\nstroys its own \u201cidentification\u201d theory when it acknowledges\nthat the object of this search was \u201cto see what [was] al-\nready known about [King].\u201d King was who he was, and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 By the way, this procedure has nothing to do with exonerating the\n\nwrongfully convicted, as the Court soothingly promises. See ante, at 17.\nThe FBI CODIS database includes DNA from unsolved crimes. I know\nof no indication (and the Court cites none) that it also includes DNA\nfrom all\u2014or even any\u2014crimes whose perpetrators have already been\nconvicted.\n10                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvolumes of his biography could not make him any more or\nany less King. No minimally competent speaker of Eng-\nlish would say, upon noticing a known arrestee\u2019s similarity\n\u201cto a wanted poster of a previously unidentified suspect,\u201d\nante, at 13, that the arrestee had thereby been identified.\nIt was the previously unidentified suspect who had been\nidentified\u2014just as, here, it was the previously unidentified\nrapist.\n                               2\n   That taking DNA samples from arrestees has nothing to\ndo with identifying them is confirmed not just by actual\npractice (which the Court ignores) but by the enabling\nstatute itself (which the Court also ignores). The Mary-\nland Act at issue has a section helpfully entitled \u201cPurpose\nof collecting and testing DNA samples.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf.\nCode Ann. \u00a72\u2013505. (One would expect such a section to\nplay a somewhat larger role in the Court\u2019s analysis of the\nAct\u2019s purpose\u2014which is to say, at least some role.) That\nprovision lists five purposes for which DNA samples may\nbe tested. By this point, it will not surprise the reader to\nlearn that the Court\u2019s imagined purpose is not among\nthem.\n   Instead, the law provides that DNA samples are collected\nand tested, as a matter of Maryland law, \u201cas part of an\nofficial investigation into a crime.\u201d \u00a72\u2013505(a)(2). (Or, as\nour suspicionless-search cases would put it: for ordinary\nlaw-enforcement purposes.) That is certainly how every-\none has always understood the Maryland Act until today.\nThe Governor of Maryland, in commenting on our deci-\nsion to hear this case, said that he was glad, because\n\u201c[a]llowing law enforcement to collect DNA samples . . . is\nabsolutely critical to our efforts to continue driving down\ncrime,\u201d and \u201cbolsters our efforts to resolve open investiga-\ntions and bring them to a resolution.\u201d Marbella, Supreme\nCourt Will Review Md.

J., in chambers) (slip op.,\nat 3).\n   More devastating still for the Court\u2019s \u201cidentification\u201d\ntheory, the statute does enumerate two instances in which\na DNA sample may be tested for the purpose of identifica-\ntion: \u201cto help identify human remains,\u201d \u00a72\u2013505(a)(3) (em-\nphasis added), and \u201cto help identify missing individuals,\u201d\n\u00a72\u2013505(a)(4) (emphasis added). No mention of identifying\narrestees. Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. And note\nagain that Maryland forbids using DNA records \u201cfor any\npurposes other than those specified\u201d\u2014it is actually a crime\nto do so. \u00a72\u2013505(b)(2).\n   The Maryland regulations implementing the Act con-\nfirm what is now monotonously obvious: These DNA\nsearches have nothing to do with identification. For ex-\nample, if someone is arrested and law enforcement deter-\nmines that \u201ca convicted offender Statewide DNA Data\nBase sample already exists\u201d for that arrestee, \u201cthe agency\nis not required to obtain a new sample.\u201d Code of Md.\nRegs., tit. 29, \u00a705.01.04(B)(4) (2011). But how could the\nState know if an arrestee has already had his DNA sample\ncollected, if the point of the sample is to identify who he is?\nOf course, if the DNA sample is instead taken in order to\ninvestigate crimes, this restriction makes perfect sense:\nHaving previously placed an identified someone\u2019s DNA on\nfile to check against available crime-scene evidence, there\nis no sense in going to the expense of taking a new sample.\n12                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaryland\u2019s regulations further require that the \u201cindivid-\nual collecting a sample . . . verify the identity of the indi-\nvidual from whom a sample is taken by name and,\nif applicable, State identification (SID) number.\u201d\n\u00a705.01.04(K). (But how?) And after the sample is taken, it\ncontinues to be identified by the individual\u2019s name, finger-\nprints, etc., see \u00a705.01.07(B)\u2014rather than (as the Court\nbelieves) being used to identify individuals.                See\n\u00a705.01.07(B)(2) (\u201cRecords and specimen information shall\nbe identified by . . . [the] [n]ame of the donor\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n  So, to review: DNA testing does not even begin until\nafter arraignment and bail decisions are already made.\nThe samples sit in storage for months, and take weeks to\ntest. When they are tested, they are checked against the\nUnsolved Crimes Collection\u2014rather than the Convict and\nArrestee Collection, which could be used to identify them.\nThe Act forbids the Court\u2019s purpose (identification), but\nprescribes as its purpose what our suspicionless-search\ncases forbid (\u201cofficial investigation into a crime\u201d). Against\nall of that, it is safe to say that if the Court\u2019s identification\ntheory is not wrong, there is no such thing as error.\n                             II\n  The Court also attempts to bolster its identification\ntheory with a series of inapposite analogies. See ante, at\n18\u201323.\n  Is not taking DNA samples the same, asks the Court, as\ntaking a person\u2019s photograph? No\u2014because that is not a\nFourth Amendment search at all. It does not involve a\nphysical intrusion onto the person, see Florida v.\nJardines, 569 U. S. 1, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3), and we\nhave never held that merely taking a person\u2019s photograph\ninvades any recognized \u201cexpectation of privacy,\u201d see Katz\nv. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967). Thus, it is unsur-\nprising that the cases the Court cites as authorizing photo-\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  13\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ntaking do not even mention the Fourth Amendment. See\nState ex rel. Bruns v. Clausmier, 154 Ind. 599, 57 N. E.\n541 (1900) (libel), Shaffer v. United States, 24 App. D. C.\n417 (1904) (Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination).\n   But is not the practice of DNA searches, the Court asks,\nthe same as taking \u201cBertillon\u201d measurements\u2014noting an\narrestee\u2019s height, shoe size, and so on, on the back of a\nphotograph? No, because that system was not, in the\nordinary case, used to solve unsolved crimes. It is possi-\nble, I suppose, to imagine situations in which such meas-\nurements might be useful to generate leads. (If witnesses\ndescribed a very tall burglar, all the \u201ctall man\u201d cards could\nthen be pulled.) But the obvious primary purpose of such\nmeasurements, as the Court\u2019s description of them makes\nclear, was to verify that, for example, the person arrested\ntoday is the same person that was arrested a year ago.\nWhich is to say, Bertillon measurements were actually\nused as a system of identification, and drew their primary\nusefulness from that task.3\n   It is on the fingerprinting of arrestees, however, that the\nCourt relies most heavily. Ante, at 20\u201323. The Court does\nnot actually say whether it believes that taking a person\u2019s\nfingerprints is a Fourth Amendment search, and our cases\nprovide no ready answer to that question. Even assuming\nso, however, law enforcement\u2019s post-arrest use of finger-\nprints could not be more different from its post-arrest\nuse of DNA. Fingerprints of arrestees are taken primarily\nto identify them (though that process sometimes solves\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Puzzlingly, the Court\u2019s discussion of photography and Bertillon\n\nmeasurements repeatedly cites state cases (such as Clausmier) that\nwere decided before the Fourth Amendment was held to be applicable\nto the States. See Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949); Mapp v. Ohio,\n367 U. S. 643 (1961). Why the Court believes them relevant to the\nmeaning of that Amendment is therefore something of a mystery.\n14                     MARYLAND v.

Ante, at 22.\nThis bold statement is bereft of citation to authority\nbecause there is none for it. The \u201cgreat expansion in finger-\nprinting came before the modern era of Fourth Amend-\nment jurisprudence,\u201d and so we were never asked to decide\nthe legitimacy of the practice. United States v. Kincade,\n379 F. 3d 813, 874 (CA9 2004) (Kozinski, J., dissenting).\nAs fingerprint databases expanded from convicted\ncriminals, to arrestees, to civil servants, to immigrants,\nto everyone with a driver\u2019s license, Americans simply\n\u201cbecame accustomed to having our fingerprints on file\nin some government database.\u201d Ibid. But it is wrong\nto suggest that this was uncontroversial at the time, or\nthat this Court blessed universal fingerprinting for\n\u201cgenerations\u201d before it was possible to use it effectively for\nidentification.\n   The Court also assures us that \u201cthe delay in processing\nDNA from arrestees is being reduced to a substantial\ndegree by rapid technical advances.\u201d Ante, at 22. The\nidea, presumably, is that the snail\u2019s pace in this case is\natypical, so that DNA is now readily usable for identifica-\ntion. The Court\u2019s proof, however, is nothing but a pair of\npress releases\u2014each of which turns out to undercut this\nargument. We learn in them that reductions in backlog\nhave enabled Ohio and Louisiana crime labs to analyze a\nsubmitted DNA sample in twenty days.5 But that is still\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/foia/privacy-impact-assessments/iafis-ngi-risc (searches\nof the \u201cUnsolved Latent File\u201d may \u201ctake considerably more time\u201d).\n   5 See Attorney General DeWine Announces Significant Drop in\n\nDNA Turnaround Time (Jan. 4, 2013), http://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/\nMedia/News-Releases/January-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-\nSignificant-Drop; Gov.

What this illustrates is\nthat these times do not take into account the many other\nsources of delay. So if the Court means to suggest that\nMaryland is unusual, that may be right\u2014it may qualify in\nthis context as a paragon of efficiency. (Indeed, the Gov-\nernor of Maryland was hailing the elimination of that\nState\u2019s backlog more than five years ago. See Wheeler,\nO\u2019Malley Wants to Expand DNA Testing, Baltimore Sun,\nJan. 11, 2008, p. 5B.) Meanwhile, the Court\u2019s holding\nwill result in the dumping of a large number of arrestee\nsamples\u2014many from minor offenders\u2014onto an already over-\nburdened system: Nearly one-third of Americans will be\narrested for some offense by age 23. See Brame, Turner,\nPaternoster, & Bushway, Cumulative Prevalence of Arrest\nFrom Ages 8 to 23 in a National Sample, 129 Pediatrics 21\n(2011).\n  The Court also accepts uncritically the Government\u2019s\nrepresentation at oral argument that it is developing\ndevices that will be able to test DNA in mere minutes. At\nmost, this demonstrates that it may one day be possible to\ndesign a program that uses DNA for a purpose other than\ncrime-solving\u2014not that Maryland has in fact designed\nsuch a program today. And that is the main point, which\nthe Court\u2019s discussion of the brave new world of instant\nDNA analysis should not obscure. The issue before us is\nnot whether DNA can some day be used for identification;\nnor even whether it can today be used for identification;\nbut whether it was used for identification here.\n  Today, it can fairly be said that fingerprints really are\nused to identify people\u2014so well, in fact, that there would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(Nov. 17, 2011), http://www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom& \n\ntmp=detail&articleID=3102.\n\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

What DNA\nadds\u2014what makes it a valuable weapon in the law-\nenforcement arsenal\u2014is the ability to solve unsolved\ncrimes, by matching old crime-scene evidence against the\nprofiles of people whose identities are already known.\nThat is what was going on when King\u2019s DNA was taken,\nand we should not disguise the fact. Solving unsolved\ncrimes is a noble objective, but it occupies a lower place in\nthe American pantheon of noble objectives than the pro-\ntection of our people from suspicionless law-enforcement\nsearches. The Fourth Amendment must prevail.\n                          *    *   *\n   The Court disguises the vast (and scary) scope of its\nholding by promising a limitation it cannot deliver. The\nCourt repeatedly says that DNA testing, and entry into a\nnational DNA registry, will not befall thee and me, dear\nreader, but only those arrested for \u201cserious offense[s].\u201d\nAnte, at 28; see also ante, at 1, 9, 14, 17, 22, 23, 24 (re-\npeatedly limiting the analysis to \u201cserious offenses\u201d). I\ncannot imagine what principle could possibly justify this\nlimitation, and the Court does not attempt to suggest any.\nIf one believes that DNA will \u201cidentify\u201d someone arrested\nfor assault, he must believe that it will \u201cidentify\u201d someone\narrested for a traffic offense. This Court does not base its\njudgments on senseless distinctions. At the end of the\nday, logic will out. When there comes before us the taking\nof DNA from an arrestee for a traffic violation, the Court\nwill predictably (and quite rightly) say, \u201cWe can find no\nsignificant difference between this case and King.\u201d Make\nno mistake about it: As an entirely predictable conse-\nquence of today\u2019s decision, your DNA can be taken and\nentered into a national DNA database if you are ever\narrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.\n   The most regrettable aspect of the suspicionless search\n18                     MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat occurred here is that it proved to be quite unneces-\nsary. All parties concede that it would have been entirely\npermissible, as far as the Fourth Amendment is con-\ncerned, for Maryland to take a sample of King\u2019s DNA as a\nconsequence of his conviction for second-degree assault.\nSo the ironic result of the Court\u2019s error is this: The only\narrestees to whom the outcome here will ever make a\ndifference are those who have been acquitted of the crime\nof arrest (so that their DNA could not have been taken\nupon conviction). In other words, this Act manages to\nburden uniquely the sole group for whom the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s protections ought to be most jealously\nguarded: people who are innocent of the State\u2019s accusations.\n   Today\u2019s judgment will, to be sure, have the beneficial\neffect of solving more crimes; then again, so would the\ntaking of DNA samples from anyone who flies on an air-\nplane (surely the Transportation Security Administration\nneeds to know the \u201cidentity\u201d of the flying public), applies\nfor a driver\u2019s license, or attends a public school. Perhaps\nthe construction of such a genetic panopticon is wise. But\nI doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our\nliberties would have been so eager to open their mouths\nfor royal inspection.\n   I therefore dissent, and hope that today\u2019s incursion upon\nthe Fourth Amendment, like an earlier one,6 will some day\nbe repudiated.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Compare, New York v.

Argued February 26, 2013\u2014Decided June 3, 2013\nAfter his 2009 arrest on first- and second-degree assault charges, re-\n  spondent King was processed through a Wicomico County, Maryland,\n  facility, where booking personnel used a cheek swab to take a DNA\n  sample pursuant to the Maryland DNA Collection Act (Act). The\n  swab was matched to an unsolved 2003 rape, and King was charged\n  with that crime. He moved to suppress the DNA match, arguing that\n  the Act violated the Fourth Amendment, but the Circuit Court Judge\n  found the law constitutional. King was convicted of rape. The Mary-\n  land Court of Appeals set aside the conviction, finding unconstitu-\n  tional the portions of the Act authorizing DNA collection from felony\n  arrestees.\nHeld: When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold\n for a serious offense and bring the suspect to the station to be de-\n tained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the ar-\n restee\u2019s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate\n police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth\n Amendment.

Respondent\u2019s identifica-\n    tion as the rapist resulted in part through the operation of the Com-\n    bined DNA Index System (CODIS), which connects DNA laboratories\n    at the local, state, and national level, and which standardizes the\n    points of comparison, i.e., loci, used in DNA analysis. Pp. 3\u20137.\n       (b) The framework for deciding the issue presented is well estab-\n    lished. Using a buccal swab inside a person\u2019s cheek to obtain a DNA\n    sample is a search under the Fourth Amendment. And the fact that\n    the intrusion is negligible is of central relevance to determining\n    whether the search is reasonable, \u201cthe ultimate measure of the con-\n    stitutionality of a governmental search,\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.\n    Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 652. Because the need for a warrant is greatly\n    diminished here, where the arrestee was already in valid police cus-\n    tody for a serious offense supported by probable cause, the search is\n    analyzed by reference to \u201creasonableness, not individualized suspi-\n    cion,\u201d Samson v. California, 547 U. S. 843, 855, n. 4, and reasonable-\n    ness is determined by weighing \u201cthe promotion of legitimate govern-\n    mental interests\u201d against \u201cthe degree to which [the search] intrudes\n    upon an individual\u2019s privacy,\u201d Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295,\n    300. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (c) In this balance of reasonableness, great weight is given to both\n    the significant government interest at stake in the identification of\n    arrestees and DNA identification\u2019s unmatched potential to serve that\n    interest. Pp. 10\u201323.\n          (1) The Act serves a well-established, legitimate government in-\n    terest: the need of law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate\n    way to process and identify persons and possessions taken into cus-\n    tody. \u201c[P]robable cause provides legal justification for arresting a\n    [suspect], and for a brief period of detention to take the administra-\n    tive steps incident to arrest,\u201d Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113\u2013\n    114; and the \u201cvalidity of the search of a person incident to a lawful\n    arrest\u201d is settled, United States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224. In-\n    dividual suspicion is not necessary. The \u201croutine administrative pro-\n    cedure[s] at a police station house incident to booking and jailing the\n    suspect\u201d have different origins and different constitutional justifica-\n    tions than, say, the search of a place not incident to arrest, Illinois v.\n    Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 643, which depends on the \u201cfair probability\n    that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular\n    place,\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 238. And when probable cause\n    exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society\n    and hold him in legal custody, DNA identification plays a critical role\n    in serving those interests. First, the government has an interest in\n    properly identifying \u201cwho has been arrested and who is being tried.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

Criminal history is critical to officers who are processing a\nsuspect for detention. They already seek identity information\nthrough routine and accepted means: comparing booking photo-\ngraphs to sketch artists\u2019 depictions, showing mugshots to potential\nwitnesses, and comparing fingerprints against electronic databases of\nknown criminals and unsolved crimes. The only difference between\nDNA analysis and fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy\nDNA provides. DNA is another metric of identification used to con-\nnect the arrestee with his or her public persona, as reflected in rec-\nords of his or her actions that are available to the police. Second, of-\nficers must ensure that the custody of an arrestee does not create\ninordinate \u201crisks for facility staff, for the existing detainee popula-\ntion, and for a new detainee.\u201d Florence v. Board of Chosen Freehold-\ners of County of Burlington, 566 U. S. ___, ___. DNA allows officers to\nknow the type of person being detained.

An arrestee\nmay be more inclined to flee if he thinks that continued contact with\nthe criminal justice system may expose another serious offense.\nFourth, an arrestee\u2019s past conduct is essential to assessing the dan-\nger he poses to the public, which will inform a court\u2019s bail determina-\ntion. Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a previous violent\ncrime based on DNA identification may be especially probative in this\nregard. Finally, in the interests of justice, identifying an arrestee as\nthe perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of\nfreeing a person wrongfully imprisoned. Pp. 10\u201318.\n     (2) DNA identification is an important advance in the techniques\nlong used by law enforcement to serve legitimate police concerns. Po-\nlice routinely have used scientific advancements as standard proce-\ndures for identifying arrestees. Fingerprinting, perhaps the most di-\nrect historical analogue to DNA technology, has, from its advent,\nbeen viewed as a natural part of \u201cthe administrative steps incident to\narrest.\u201d County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 58. How-\never, DNA identification is far superior. The additional intrusion up-\non the arrestee\u2019s privacy beyond that associated with fingerprinting\nis not significant, and DNA identification is markedly more accurate.\nIt may not be as fast as fingerprinting, but rapid fingerprint analysis\nis itself of recent vintage, and the question of how long it takes to\nprocess identifying information goes to the efficacy of the search for\nits purpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality of the\nsearch. Rapid technical advances are also reducing DNA processing\ntimes. Pp. 18\u201323.\n   (d) The government interest is not outweighed by respondent\u2019s pri-\n4                          MARYLAND v.

Pp. 23\u201328.\n         (1) By comparison to the substantial government interest and the\n    unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a cheek\n    swab to obtain a DNA sample is minimal. Reasonableness must be\n    considered in the context of an individual\u2019s legitimate privacy expec-\n    tations, which necessarily diminish when he is taken into police cus-\n    tody. Bell, supra, at 557. Such searches thus differ from the so-\n    called special needs searches of, e.g., otherwise law-abiding motorists\n    at checkpoints. See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32. The rea-\n    sonableness inquiry considers two other circumstances in which par-\n    ticularized suspicion is not categorically required: \u201cdiminished expec-\n    tations of privacy [and a] minimal intrusion.\u201d Illinois v. McArthur,\n    531 U. S. 326, 330. An invasive surgery may raise privacy concerns\n    weighty enough for the search to require a warrant, notwithstanding\n    the arrestee\u2019s diminished privacy expectations, but a buccal swab,\n    which involves a brief and minimal intrusion with \u201cvirtually no risk,\n    trauma, or pain,\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 771, does\n    not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of\n    arrest. Pp. 23\u201326.\n         (2) The processing of respondent\u2019s DNA sample\u2019s CODIS loci also\n    did not intrude on his privacy in a way that would make his DNA\n    identification unconstitutional. Those loci came from noncoding DNA\n    parts that do not reveal an arrestee\u2019s genetic traits and are unlikely\n    to reveal any private medical information. Even if they could provide\n    such information, they are not in fact tested for that end. Finally, the\n    Act provides statutory protections to guard against such invasions of\n    privacy.

ALONZO JAY KING, JR.\n  ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF \n\n                     MARYLAND\n\n                                [June 3, 2013]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 2003 a man concealing his face and armed with a gun\nbroke into a woman\u2019s home in Salisbury, Maryland. He\nraped her. The police were unable to identify or appre\u00ad\nhend the assailant based on any detailed description or\nother evidence they then had, but they did obtain from the\nvictim a sample of the perpetrator\u2019s DNA.\n   In 2009 Alonzo King was arrested in Wicomico County,\nMaryland, and charged with first- and second-degree\nassault for menacing a group of people with a shotgun. As\npart of a routine booking procedure for serious offenses,\nhis DNA sample was taken by applying a cotton swab or\nfilter paper\u2014known as a buccal swab\u2014to the inside of his\ncheeks. The DNA was found to match the DNA taken\nfrom the Salisbury rape victim. King was tried and con\u00ad\nvicted for the rape. Additional DNA samples were taken\nfrom him and used in the rape trial, but there seems to be\nno doubt that it was the DNA from the cheek sample\ntaken at the time he was booked in 2009 that led to his\nfirst having been linked to the rape and charged with its\ncommission.\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland, on review of King\u2019s\n2                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nrape conviction, ruled that the DNA taken when King was\nbooked for the 2009 charge was an unlawful seizure be\u00ad\ncause obtaining and using the cheek swab was an unrea\u00ad\nsonable search of the person. It set the rape conviction\naside. This Court granted certiorari and now reverses the\njudgment of the Maryland court.\n                             I\n   When King was arrested on April 10, 2009, for menac\u00ad\ning a group of people with a shotgun and charged in state\ncourt with both first- and second-degree assault, he was\nprocessed for detention in custody at the Wicomico County\nCentral Booking facility. Booking personnel used a cheek\nswab to take the DNA sample from him pursuant to provi\u00ad\nsions of the Maryland DNA Collection Act (or Act).\n   On July 13, 2009, King\u2019s DNA record was uploaded to\nthe Maryland DNA database, and three weeks later, on\nAugust 4, 2009, his DNA profile was matched to the DNA\nsample collected in the unsolved 2003 rape case. Once the\nDNA was matched to King, detectives presented the foren\u00ad\nsic evidence to a grand jury, which indicted him for the\nrape. Detectives obtained a search warrant and took a\nsecond sample of DNA from King, which again matched\nthe evidence from the rape. He moved to suppress the\nDNA match on the grounds that Maryland\u2019s DNA collec\u00ad\ntion law violated the Fourth Amendment. The Circuit\nCourt Judge upheld the statute as constitutional. King\npleaded not guilty to the rape charges but was convicted\nand sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of\nparole.\n   In a divided opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals\nstruck down the portions of the Act authorizing collection\nof DNA from felony arrestees as unconstitutional. The\nmajority concluded that a DNA swab was an unreasonable\nsearch in violation of the Fourth Amendment because\nKing\u2019s \u201cexpectation of privacy is greater than the State\u2019s\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

S. ___ (2012), to\naddress the question. King is the respondent here.\n                              II\n   The advent of DNA technology is one of the most signifi\u00ad\ncant scientific advancements of our era. The full potential\nfor use of genetic markers in medicine and science is still\nbeing explored, but the utility of DNA identification in the\ncriminal justice system is already undisputed. Since the\nfirst use of forensic DNA analysis to catch a rapist and\nmurderer in England in 1986, see J. Butler, Fundamentals\nof Forensic DNA Typing 5 (2009) (hereinafter Butler), law\nenforcement, the defense bar, and the courts have\nacknowledged DNA testing\u2019s \u201cunparalleled ability both to\nexonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty.\nIt has the potential to significantly improve both the\ncriminal justice system and police investigative practices.\u201d\nDistrict Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os-\nborne, 557 U. S. 52, 55 (2009).\n                             A\n   The current standard for forensic DNA testing relies on\nan analysis of the chromosomes located within the nucleus\nof all human cells. \u201cThe DNA material in chromosomes is\n4                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncomposed of \u2018coding\u2019 and \u2018noncoding\u2019 regions. The coding\nregions are known as genes and contain the information\nnecessary for a cell to make proteins. . . . Non-protein\u00ad\ncoding regions . . . are not related directly to making pro\u00ad\nteins, [and] have been referred to as \u2018junk\u2019 DNA.\u201d Butler\n25. The adjective \u201cjunk\u201d may mislead the layperson, for\nin fact this is the DNA region used with near certainty to\nidentify a person. The term apparently is intended to\nindicate that this particular noncoding region, while use\u00ad\nful and even dispositive for purposes like identity, does not\nshow more far-reaching and complex characteristics like\ngenetic traits.\n   Many of the patterns found in DNA are shared among\nall people, so forensic analysis focuses on \u201crepeated DNA\nsequences scattered throughout the human genome,\u201d\nknown as \u201cshort tandem repeats\u201d (STRs). Id., at 147\u2013148.\nThe alternative possibilities for the size and frequency of\nthese STRs at any given point along a strand of DNA are\nknown as \u201calleles,\u201d id., at 25; and multiple alleles are\nanalyzed in order to ensure that a DNA profile matches\nonly one individual. Future refinements may improve pres-\nent technology, but even now STR analysis makes it\n \u201cpossible to determine whether a biological tissue match\u00ad\nes a suspect with near certainty.\u201d Osborne, supra, at 62.\n   The Act authorizes Maryland law enforcement author\u00ad\nities to collect DNA samples from \u201can individual who is\ncharged with . . . a crime of violence or an attempt to\ncommit a crime of violence; or . . . burglary or an attempt\nto commit burglary.\u201d Md.

It is at this point that a judicial\nofficer ensures that there is probable cause to detain the\narrestee on a qualifying serious offense. If \u201call qualifying\ncriminal charges are determined to be unsupported by\nprobable cause . . . the DNA sample shall be immediately\ndestroyed.\u201d \u00a72\u2013504(d)(2)(i). DNA samples are also de\u00ad\nstroyed if \u201ca criminal action begun against the individual\n. . . does not result in a conviction,\u201d \u201cthe conviction is\nfinally reversed or vacated and no new trial is permitted,\u201d\nor \u201cthe individual is granted an unconditional pardon.\u201d\n\u00a72\u2013511(a)(1).\n    The Act also limits the information added to a DNA\ndatabase and how it may be used. Specifically, \u201c[o]nly\nDNA records that directly relate to the identification of\nindividuals shall be collected and stored.\u201d \u00a72\u2013505(b)(1).\nNo purpose other than identification is permissible: \u201cA\nperson may not willfully test a DNA sample for infor\u00ad\nmation that does not relate to the identification of indi\u00ad\nviduals as specified in this subtitle.\u201d \u00a72\u2013512(c). Tests for\nfamilial matches are also prohibited. See \u00a72\u2013506(d) (\u201cA\nperson may not perform a search of the statewide DNA\ndata base for the purpose of identification of an offender\nin connection with a crime for which the offender may be\na biological relative of the individual from whom the DNA\nsample was acquired\u201d). The officers involved in taking\nand analyzing respondent\u2019s DNA sample complied with\nthe Act in all respects.\n    Respondent\u2019s DNA was collected in this case using a\ncommon procedure known as a \u201cbuccal swab.\u201d \u201cBuccal cell\ncollection involves wiping a small piece of filter paper or a\ncotton swab similar to a Q-tip against the inside cheek of\nan individual\u2019s mouth to collect some skin cells.\u201d Butler\n86. The procedure is quick and painless. The swab touches\ninside an arrestee\u2019s mouth, but it requires no \u201csurgical\nintrusio[n] beneath the skin,\u201d Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S.\n753, 760 (1985), and it poses no \u201cthrea[t] to the health or\n6                     MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsafety\u201d of arrestees, id., at 763.\n                             B\n   Respondent\u2019s identification as the rapist resulted in part\nthrough the operation of a national project to standardize\ncollection and storage of DNA profiles. Authorized by\nCongress and supervised by the Federal Bureau of Inves\u00ad\ntigation, the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) con\u00ad\nnects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national\nlevel. Since its authorization in 1994, the CODIS system\nhas grown to include all 50 States and a number of federal\nagencies. CODIS collects DNA profiles provided by local\nlaboratories taken from arrestees, convicted offenders, and\nforensic evidence found at crime scenes. To participate\nin CODIS, a local laboratory must sign a memorandum of\nunderstanding agreeing to adhere to quality standards\nand submit to audits to evaluate compliance with the\nfederal standards for scientifically rigorous DNA testing.\nButler 270.\n   One of the most significant aspects of CODIS is the\nstandardization of the points of comparison in DNA analy\u00ad\nsis. The CODIS database is based on 13 loci at which\nthe STR alleles are noted and compared. These loci make\npossible extreme accuracy in matching individual samples,\nwith a \u201crandom match probability of approximately 1 in\n100 trillion (assuming unrelated individuals).\u201d Ibid. The\nCODIS loci are from the non-protein coding junk regions\nof DNA, and \u201care not known to have any association\nwith a genetic disease or any other genetic predisposition.\nThus, the information in the database is only useful for\nhuman identity testing.\u201d Id., at 279. STR information\nis recorded only as a \u201cstring of numbers\u201d; and the DNA\nidentification is accompanied only by information denoting\nthe laboratory and the analyst responsible for the submis\u00ad\nsion. Id., at 270. In short, CODIS sets uniform national\nstandards for DNA matching and then facilitates connec\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

See Brief for Respondent 48. Twenty-eight\nStates and the Federal Government have adopted laws\nsimilar to the Maryland Act authorizing the collection of\nDNA from some or all arrestees. See Brief for State of\nCalifornia et al. as Amici Curiae 4, n. 1 (States Brief)\n(collecting state statutes). Although those statutes vary\nin their particulars, such as what charges require a DNA\nsample, their similarity means that this case implicates\nmore than the specific Maryland law. At issue is a stand\u00ad\nard, expanding technology already in widespread use\nthroughout the Nation.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n   Although the DNA swab procedure used here presents a\nquestion the Court has not yet addressed, the framework\nfor deciding the issue is well established. The Fourth\nAmendment, binding on the States by the Fourteenth\nAmendment, provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to\nbe secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,\nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\nviolated.\u201d It can be agreed that using a buccal swab on the\ninner tissues of a person\u2019s cheek in order to obtain DNA\nsamples is a search. Virtually any \u201cintrusio[n] into the\nhuman body,\u201d Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770\n(1966), will work an invasion of \u201c \u2018cherished personal secu\u00ad\nrity\u2019 that is subject to constitutional scrutiny,\u201d Cupp v.\nMurphy, 412 U. S. 291, 295 (1973) (quoting Terry v. Ohio,\n392 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1968)). The Court has applied the\nFourth Amendment to police efforts to draw blood, see\nSchmerber, supra; Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U. S. ___\n8                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(2013), scraping an arrestee\u2019s fingernails to obtain trace\nevidence, see Cupp, supra, and even to \u201ca breathalyzer\ntest, which generally requires the production of alveolar\nor \u2018deep lung\u2019 breath for chemical analysis,\u201d Skinner v.\nRailway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 616\n(1989).\n   A buccal swab is a far more gentle process than a veni\u00ad\npuncture to draw blood. It involves but a light touch on\nthe inside of the cheek; and although it can be deemed\na search within the body of the arrestee, it requires no\n\u201csurgical intrusions beneath the skin.\u201d Winston, 470 U. S.,\nat 760. The fact than an intrusion is negligible is of cen\u00ad\ntral relevance to determining reasonableness, although it\nis still a search as the law defines that term.\n                              B\n   To say that the Fourth Amendment applies here is the\nbeginning point, not the end of the analysis. \u201c[T]he Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s proper function is to constrain, not against\nall intrusions as such, but against intrusions which are\nnot justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an\nimproper manner.\u201d Schmerber, supra, at 768. \u201cAs the text\nof the Fourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure\nof the constitutionality of a governmental search is \u2018rea\u00ad\nsonableness.\u2019 \u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515\nU. S. 646, 652 (1995). In giving content to the inquiry\nwhether an intrusion is reasonable, the Court has pre\u00ad\nferred \u201csome quantum of individualized suspicion . . . [as]\na prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure. But\nthe Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible require\u00ad\nment of such suspicion.\u201d United States v. Martinez-Fuerte,\n428 U. S. 543, 560\u2013561 (1976) (citation and footnote\nomitted).\n   In some circumstances, such as \u201c[w]hen faced with\nspecial law enforcement needs, diminished expectations of\nprivacy, minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that certain general, or individual, circumstances\nmay render a warrantless search or seizure reasonable.\u201d\nIllinois v. McArthur, 531 U. S. 326, 330 (2001). Those\ncircumstances diminish the need for a warrant, either\nbecause \u201cthe public interest is such that neither a warrant\nnor probable cause is required,\u201d Maryland v. Buie, 494\nU. S. 325, 331 (1990), or because an individual is already\non notice, for instance because of his employment, see\nSkinner, supra, or the conditions of his release from gov\u00ad\nernment custody, see Samson v. California, 547 U. S. 843\n(2006), that some reasonable police intrusion on his pri\u00ad\nvacy is to be expected. The need for a warrant is perhaps\nleast when the search involves no discretion that could\nproperly be limited by the \u201cinterpo[lation of] a neutral\nmagistrate between the citizen and the law enforcement\nofficer.\u201d Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656,\n667 (1989).\n   The instant case can be addressed with this background.\nThe Maryland DNA Collection Act provides that, in order\nto obtain a DNA sample, all arrestees charged with seri\u00ad\nous crimes must furnish the sample on a buccal swab\napplied, as noted, to the inside of the cheeks. The arrestee\nis already in valid police custody for a serious offense\nsupported by probable cause. The DNA collection is not\nsubject to the judgment of officers whose perspective\nmight be \u201ccolored by their primary involvement in \u2018the\noften competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u2019 \u201d Terry,\nsupra, at 12 (quoting Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S.\n10, 14 (1948)). As noted by this Court in a different\nbut still instructive context involving blood testing, \u201c[b]oth\nthe circumstances justifying toxicological testing and the\npermissible limits of such intrusions are defined nar-\nrowly and specifically in the regulations that authorize\nthem . . . . Indeed, in light of the standardized nature of\nthe tests and the minimal discretion vested in those\ncharged with administering the program, there are virtu\u00ad\n10                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nally no facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate.\u201d Skin-\nner, supra, at 622. Here, the search effected by the buccal\nswab of respondent falls within the category of cases\nthis Court has analyzed by reference to the proposition\nthat the \u201ctouchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reason\u00ad\nableness, not individualized suspicion.\u201d Samson, supra, at\n855, n. 4.\n   Even if a warrant is not required, a search is not beyond\nFourth Amendment scrutiny; for it must be reasonable in\nits scope and manner of execution. Urgent government\ninterests are not a license for indiscriminate police behav\u00ad\nior. To say that no warrant is required is merely to\nacknowledge that \u201crather than employing a per se rule of\nunreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law\nenforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion\nwas reasonable.\u201d McArthur, supra, at 331. This applica\u00ad\ntion of \u201ctraditional standards of reasonableness\u201d requires a\ncourt to weigh \u201cthe promotion of legitimate governmen\u00ad\ntal interests\u201d against \u201cthe degree to which [the search]\nintrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy.\u201d Wyoming v. Hough-\nton, 526 U. S. 295, 300 (1999). An assessment of reasona\u00ad\nbleness to determine the lawfulness of requiring this class\nof arrestees to provide a DNA sample is central to the\ninstant case.\n                            IV \n\n                             A\n\n  The legitimate government interest served by the Mary\u00ad\nland DNA Collection Act is one that is well established:\nthe need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accu\u00ad\nrate way to process and identify the persons and posses\u00ad\nsions they must take into custody. It is beyond dispute\nthat \u201cprobable cause provides legal justification for arrest\u00ad\ning a person suspected of crime, and for a brief period of\ndetention to take the administrative steps incident to\narrest.\u201d Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113\u2013114 (1975).\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914), over\u00ad\nruled on other grounds, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.

Robinson, 414 U. S. 218, 224 (1973).\nEven in that context, the Court has been clear that indi\u00ad\nvidual suspicion is not necessary, because \u201c[t]he constitu\u00ad\ntionality of a search incident to an arrest does not depend\non whether there is any indication that the person ar\u00ad\nrested possesses weapons or evidence. The fact of a lawful\narrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.\u201d Michigan v.\nDeFillippo, 443 U. S. 31, 35 (1979).\n   The \u201croutine administrative procedure[s] at a police sta\u00ad\ntion house incident to booking and jailing the suspect\u201d\nderive from different origins and have different constitu\u00ad\ntional justifications than, say, the search of a place, Illi-\nnois v. Lafayette, 462 U. S. 640, 643 (1983); for the search\nof a place not incident to an arrest depends on the \u201cfair\nprobability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be\nfound in a particular place,\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.\n213, 238 (1983). The interests are further different when\nan individual is formally processed into police custody.\nThen \u201cthe law is in the act of subjecting the body of the\naccused to its physical dominion.\u201d People v. Chiagles, 237\nN. Y. 193, 197, 142 N. E. 583, 584 (1923) (Cardozo, J.).\nWhen probable cause exists to remove an individual from\nthe normal channels of society and hold him in legal cus\u00ad\ntody, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving\nthose interests.\n   First, \u201c[i]n every criminal case, it is known and must be\nknown who has been arrested and who is being tried.\u201d\nHiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt\n12                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nCty., 542 U. S. 177, 191 (2004). An individual\u2019s identity is\nmore than just his name or Social Security number, and\nthe government\u2019s interest in identification goes beyond\nensuring that the proper name is typed on the indictment.\nIdentity has never been considered limited to the name on\nthe arrestee\u2019s birth certificate. In fact, a name is of little\nvalue compared to the real interest in identification at\nstake when an individual is brought into custody. \u201cIt is\na well recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the per\u00ad\npetrator will take unusual steps to conceal not only his\nconduct, but also his identity. Disguises used while com\u00ad\nmitting a crime may be supplemented or replaced by\nchanged names, and even changed physical features.\u201d\nJones v. Murray, 962 F. 2d 302, 307 (CA4 1992). An \u201car\u00ad\nrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie about his identity,\u201d\nand \u201ccriminal history records . . . can be inaccurate or\nincomplete.\u201d Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of\nCounty of Burlington, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 16).\n   A suspect\u2019s criminal history is a critical part of his iden\u00ad\ntity that officers should know when processing him for\ndetention. It is a common occurrence that \u201c[p]eople de\u00ad\ntained for minor offenses can turn out to be the most\ndevious and dangerous criminals. Hours after the Okla\u00ad\nhoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a\nstate trooper who noticed he was driving without a license\nplate. Police stopped serial killer Joel Rifkin for the same\nreason. One of the terrorists involved in the September 11\nattacks was stopped and ticketed for speeding just two\ndays before hijacking Flight 93.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at\n14) (citations omitted). Police already seek this crucial\nidentifying information. They use routine and accepted\nmeans as varied as comparing the suspect\u2019s booking pho\u00ad\ntograph to sketch artists\u2019 depictions of persons of interest,\nshowing his mugshot to potential witnesses, and of course\nmaking a computerized comparison of the arrestee\u2019s fin\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngerprints against electronic databases of known criminals\nand unsolved crimes. In this respect the only difference\nbetween DNA analysis and the accepted use of fingerprint\ndatabases is the unparalleled accuracy DNA provides.\n   The task of identification necessarily entails searching\npublic and police records based on the identifying infor\u00ad\nmation provided by the arrestee to see what is already\nknown about him. The DNA collected from arrestees is\nan irrefutable identification of the person from whom it\nwas taken. Like a fingerprint, the 13 CODIS loci are not\nthemselves evidence of any particular crime, in the way\nthat a drug test can by itself be evidence of illegal narcot\u00ad\nics use. A DNA profile is useful to the police because it\ngives them a form of identification to search the records\nalready in their valid possession. In this respect the use of\nDNA for identification is no different than matching an\narrestee\u2019s face to a wanted poster of a previously unidenti\u00ad\nfied suspect; or matching tattoos to known gang symbols\nto reveal a criminal affiliation; or matching the arrestee\u2019s\nfingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 19. DNA is another metric of identifica\u00ad\ntion used to connect the arrestee with his or her public\npersona, as reflected in records of his or her actions that\nare available to the police. Those records may be linked to\nthe arrestee by a variety of relevant forms of identifica\u00ad\ntion, including name, alias, date and time of previous\nconvictions and the name then used, photograph, Social\nSecurity number, or CODIS profile. These data, found in\nofficial records, are checked as a routine matter to produce\na more comprehensive record of the suspect\u2019s complete\nidentity. Finding occurrences of the arrestee\u2019s CODIS\nprofile in outstanding cases is consistent with this com\u00ad\nmon practice. It uses a different form of identification\nthan a name or fingerprint, but its function is the same.\n   Second, law enforcement officers bear a responsibility\nfor ensuring that the custody of an arrestee does not cre\u00ad\n14                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nate inordinate \u201crisks for facility staff, for the existing\ndetainee population, and for a new detainee.\u201d Florence,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 10). DNA identification can\nprovide untainted information to those charged with de\u00ad\ntaining suspects and detaining the property of any felon.\nFor these purposes officers must know the type of person\nwhom they are detaining, and DNA allows them to make\ncritical choices about how to proceed.\n     \u201cKnowledge of identity may inform an officer that a\n     suspect is wanted for another offense, or has a record\n     of violence or mental disorder. On the other hand,\n     knowing identity may help clear a suspect and al\u00ad\n     low the police to concentrate their efforts elsewhere.\n     Identity may prove particularly important in [certain\n     cases, such as] where the police are investigating\n     what appears to be a domestic assault. Officers called\n     to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom\n     they are dealing with in order to assess the situation,\n     the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to\n     the potential victim.\u201d Hiibel, supra, at 186.\nRecognizing that a name alone cannot address this inter\u00ad\nest in identity, the Court has approved, for example, \u201ca\nvisual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of\ngang affiliation as part of the intake process,\u201d because\n\u201c[t]he identification and isolation of gang members before\nthey are admitted protects everyone.\u201d Florence, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 11).\n   Third, looking forward to future stages of criminal\nprosecution, \u201cthe Government has a substantial interest in\nensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for\ntrials.\u201d Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 534 (1979). A per\u00ad\nson who is arrested for one offense but knows that he has\nyet to answer for some past crime may be more inclined to\nflee the instant charges, lest continued contact with the\ncriminal justice system expose one or more other serious\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noffenses. For example, a defendant who had committed a\nprior sexual assault might be inclined to flee on a burglary\ncharge, knowing that in every State a DNA sample would\nbe taken from him after his conviction on the burglary\ncharge that would tie him to the more serious charge of\nrape. In addition to subverting the administration of\njustice with respect to the crime of arrest, this ties back\nto the interest in safety; for a detainee who absconds\nfrom custody presents a risk to law enforcement officers,\nother detainees, victims of previous crimes, witnesses, and\nsociety at large.\n   Fourth, an arrestee\u2019s past conduct is essential to an\nassessment of the danger he poses to the public, and this\nwill inform a court\u2019s determination whether the individual\nshould be released on bail. \u201cThe government\u2019s interest in\npreventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and com\u00ad\npelling.\u201d United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 749\n(1987). DNA identification of a suspect in a violent crime\nprovides critical information to the police and judicial\nofficials in making a determination of the arrestee\u2019s future\ndangerousness. This inquiry always has entailed some\nscrutiny beyond the name on the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense. For example, Maryland law requires a judge to\ntake into account not only \u201cthe nature and circumstances\nof the offense charged\u201d but also \u201cthe defendant\u2019s family\nties, employment status and history, financial resources,\nreputation, character and mental condition, length of res\u00ad\nidence in the community.\u201d 1 Md. Rules 4\u2013216(f)(1)(A),\n(C) (2013). Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a\nprevious violent crime based on DNA identification is\nespecially probative of the court\u2019s consideration of \u201cthe\ndanger of the defendant to the alleged victim, another\nperson, or the community.\u201d        Rule 4\u2013216(f)(1)(G); see\nalso 18 U. S. C. \u00a73142 (2006 ed. and Supp. V) (similar\nrequirements).\n   This interest is not speculative. In considering laws to\n16                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequire collecting DNA from arrestees, government agen\u00ad\ncies around the Nation found evidence of numerous\ncases in which felony arrestees would have been identified\nas violent through DNA identification matching them\nto previous crimes but who later committed additional\ncrimes because such identification was not used to detain\nthem. See Denver\u2019s Study on Preventable Crimes (2009)\n(three examples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_\nDocuments / Denver%27s%20Preventable%20Crimes%20\nStudy.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 31,\n2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file); Chi\u00ad\ncago\u2019s Study on Preventable Crimes (2005) (five exam-\nples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_Documents/\nArrestee_Database / Chicago%20Preventable%20Crimes-\nFinal.pdf; Maryland Study on Preventable Crimes (2008)\n(three examples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_\nDocuments/MarylandDNAarresteestudy.pdf.\n   Present capabilities make it possible to complete a DNA\nidentification that provides information essential to de\u00ad\ntermining whether a detained suspect can be released\npending trial. See, e.g., States Brief 18, n. 10 (\u201cDNA iden\u00ad\ntification database samples have been processed in as few\nas two days in California, although around 30 days has\nbeen average\u201d). Regardless of when the initial bail deci\u00ad\nsion is made, release is not appropriate until a further\ndetermination is made as to the person\u2019s identity in the\nsense not only of what his birth certificate states but also\nwhat other records and data disclose to give that identity\nmore meaning in the whole context of who the person\nreally is. And even when release is permitted, the back\u00ad\nground identity of the suspect is necessary for determining\nwhat conditions must be met before release is allowed. If\nrelease is authorized, it may take time for the conditions\nto be met, and so the time before actual release can be\nsubstantial. For example, in the federal system, defend\u00ad\nants released conditionally are detained on average for\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of\nJustice Statistics, Compendium of Federal Justice Statis\u00ad\ntics 45 (NCJ\u2013213476, Dec. 2006) online at http://bjs.gov/\ncontent/pub/pdf/cfjs04.pdf. During this entire period, ad\u00ad\nditional and supplemental data establishing more about\nthe person\u2019s identity and background can provide critical\ninformation relevant to the conditions of release and\nwhether to revisit an initial release determination. The\nfacts of this case are illustrative. Though the record is not\nclear, if some thought were being given to releasing the\nrespondent on bail on the gun charge, a release that would\ntake weeks or months in any event, when the DNA report\nlinked him to the prior rape, it would be relevant to the\nconditions of his release. The same would be true with a\nsupplemental fingerprint report.\n    Even if an arrestee is released on bail, development of\nDNA identification revealing the defendant\u2019s unknown\nviolent past can and should lead to the revocation of his\nconditional release. See 18 U. S. C. \u00a73145(a) (providing for\nrevocation of release); see also States Brief 11\u201312 (discuss\u00ad\ning examples where bail and diversion determinations\nwere reversed after DNA identified the arrestee\u2019s vio\u00ad\nlent history). Pretrial release of a person charged with a\ndangerous crime is a most serious responsibility. It is reason\u00ad\nable in all respects for the State to use an accepted data\u00ad\nbase to determine if an arrestee is the object of suspicion\nin other serious crimes, suspicion that may provide a\nstrong incentive for the arrestee to escape and flee.\n    Finally, in the interests of justice, the identification of\nan arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may\nhave the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully\nimprisoned for the same offense. \u201c[P]rompt [DNA] testing\n. . . would speed up apprehension of criminals before they\ncommit additional crimes, and prevent the grotesque\n18                   MARYLAND v.

Scheck, Actual Innocence 245 (2000).\n   Because proper processing of arrestees is so important\nand has consequences for every stage of the criminal\nprocess, the Court has recognized that the \u201cgovernmen-\ntal interests underlying a station-house search of the ar\u00ad\nrestee\u2019s person and possessions may in some circumstances\nbe even greater than those supporting a search imme\u00ad\ndiately following arrest.\u201d Lafayette, 462 U. S., at 645.\nThus, the Court has been reluctant to circumscribe the\nauthority of the police to conduct reasonable booking\nsearches. For example, \u201c[t]he standards traditionally\ngoverning a search incident to lawful arrest are not . . .\ncommuted to the stricter Terry standards.\u201d Robinson,\n414 U. S., at 234. Nor are these interests in identifica-\ntion served only by a search of the arrestee himself.\n\u201c[I]nspection of an arrestee\u2019s personal property may assist\nthe police in ascertaining or verifying his identity.\u201d Lafa-\nyette, supra, at 646. And though the Fifth Amendment\u2019s\nprotection against self-incrimination is not, as a general\nrule, governed by a reasonableness standard, the Court\nhas held that \u201cquestions . . . reasonably related to the\npolice\u2019s administrative concerns . . . fall outside the protec\u00ad\ntions of Miranda [v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)] and the\nanswers thereto need not be suppressed.\u201d Pennsylvania v.\nMuniz, 496 U. S. 582, 601\u2013602 (1990).\n                            B\n  DNA identification represents an important advance\nin the techniques used by law enforcement to serve le\u00ad\ngitimate police concerns for as long as there have been\narrests, concerns the courts have acknowledged and ap\u00ad\nproved for more than a century.        Law enforcement\nagencies routinely have used scientific advancements in\ntheir standard procedures for the identification of ar\u00ad\nrestees. \u201cPolice had been using photography to capture\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Courts did not dispute that\npractice, concluding that a \u201csheriff in making an arrest for\na felony on a warrant has the right to exercise a discretion\n. . . , [if] he should deem it necessary to the safe-keeping of\na prisoner, and to prevent his escape, or to enable him the\nmore readily to retake the prisoner if he should escape, to\ntake his photograph.\u201d State ex rel.

By the\ntime that it had become \u201cthe daily practice of the police\nofficers and detectives of crime to use photographic pic\u00ad\ntures for the discovery and identification of criminals,\u201d the\ncourts likewise had come to the conclusion that \u201cit would\nbe [a] matter of regret to have its use unduly restricted\nupon any fanciful theory or constitutional privilege.\u201d\nShaffer v. United States, 24 App. D. C. 417, 426 (1904).\n    Beginning in 1887, some police adopted more exacting\nmeans to identify arrestees, using the system of precise\nphysical measurements pioneered by the French anthro\u00ad\npologist Alphonse Bertillon. Bertillon identification con\u00ad\nsisted of 10 measurements of the arrestee\u2019s body, along\nwith a \u201cscientific analysis of the features of the face and\nan exact anatomical localization of the various scars,\nmarks, &c., of the body.\u201d Defense of the Bertillon System,\nN. Y. Times, Jan. 20, 1896, p. 3. \u201c[W]hen a prisoner was\nbrought in, his photograph was taken according to the\nBertillon system, and his body measurements were then\nmade. The measurements were made . . . and noted down\non the back of a card or a blotter, and the photograph of\nthe prisoner was expected to be placed on the card. This\ncard, therefore, furnished both the likeness and descrip\u00ad\ntion of the prisoner, and was placed in the rogues\u2019 gallery,\nand copies were sent to various cities where similar rec\u00ad\nords were kept.\u201d People ex rel.

S. ____ (2013)             21\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n        .           .               .             .     .\n      \u201cWe find no ground in reason or authority for inter\u00ad\n    fering with a method of identifying persons charged\n    with crime which has now become widely known and\n    frequently practiced.\u201d Id., at 69\u201370.\nBy the middle of the 20th century, it was considered \u201cele\u00ad\nmentary that a person in lawful custody may be required\nto submit to photographing and fingerprinting as part of\nroutine identification processes.\u201d Smith v. United States,\n324 F. 2d 879, 882 (CADC 1963) (Burger, J.) (citations\nomitted).\n   DNA identification is an advanced technique superior to\nfingerprinting in many ways, so much so that to insist on\nfingerprints as the norm would make little sense to either\nthe forensic expert or a layperson. The additional intru\u00ad\nsion upon the arrestee\u2019s privacy beyond that associated\nwith fingerprinting is not significant, see Part V, infra,\nand DNA is a markedly more accurate form of identifying\narrestees. A suspect who has changed his facial features\nto evade photographic identification or even one who has\nundertaken the more arduous task of altering his finger\u00ad\nprints cannot escape the revealing power of his DNA.\n   The respondent\u2019s primary objection to this analogy is\nthat DNA identification is not as fast as fingerprinting,\nand so it should not be considered to be the 21st-century\nequivalent. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 53. But rapid analysis of\nfingerprints is itself of recent vintage. The FBI\u2019s vaunted\nIntegrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System\n(IAFIS) was only \u201claunched on July 28, 1999. Prior to this\ntime, the processing of . . . fingerprint submissions was\nlargely a manual, labor-intensive process, taking weeks or\nmonths to process a single submission.\u201d Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identifi\u00ad\ncation System, online at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/\nfingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis. It was not the advent of\n22                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthis technology that rendered fingerprint analysis consti\u00ad\ntutional in a single moment. The question of how long it\ntakes to process identifying information obtained from a\nvalid search goes only to the efficacy of the search for its\npurpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality\nof the search. Cf. Ontario v. Quon, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 15). Given the importance of DNA in\nthe identification of police records pertaining to arrestees\nand the need to refine and confirm that identity for its\nimportant bearing on the decision to continue release on\nbail or to impose of new conditions, DNA serves an essen\u00ad\ntial purpose despite the existence of delays such as the\none that occurred in this case. Even so, the delay in\nprocessing DNA from arrestees is being reduced to a sub\u00ad\nstantial degree by rapid technical advances. See, e.g., At\u00ad\ntorney General DeWine Announces Significant Drop in DNA\nTurnaround Time (Jan. 4, 2013) (DNA processing time\nreduced from 125 days in 2010 to 20 days in 2012), online at\nhttp://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/January-\n2013/Attorney- General - DeWine -Announces- Significant-\nDrop; Gov. Jindal Announces Elimination of DNA\nBacklog, DNA Unit Now Operating in Real Time (Nov. 17,\n2011) (average DNA report time reduced from a year\nor more in 2009 to 20 days in 2011), online at http://\nwww.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail\n&articleID=3102. And the FBI has already begun testing\ndevices that will enable police to process the DNA of ar\u00ad\nrestees within 90 minutes. See Brief for National District\nAttorneys Association as Amicus Curiae 20\u201321; Tr. of Oral\nArg. 17. An assessment and understanding of the reason\u00ad\nableness of this minimally invasive search of a person\ndetained for a serious crime should take account of these\ntechnical advances. Just as fingerprinting was constitu\u00ad\ntional for generations prior to the introduction of IAFIS,\nDNA identification of arrestees is a permissible tool of law\nenforcement today. New technology will only further\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           23\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimprove its speed and therefore its effectiveness. And, as\nnoted above, actual release of a serious offender as a rou\u00ad\ntine matter takes weeks or months in any event. By iden\u00ad\ntifying not only who the arrestee is but also what other\navailable records disclose about his past to show who he is,\nthe police can ensure that they have the proper person\nunder arrest and that they have made the necessary\narrangements for his custody; and, just as important, they\ncan also prevent suspicion against or prosecution of the\ninnocent.\n   In sum, there can be little reason to question \u201cthe legit\u00ad\nimate interest of the government in knowing for an abso\u00ad\nlute certainty the identity of the person arrested, in\nknowing whether he is wanted elsewhere, and in ensuring\nhis identification in the event he flees prosecution.\u201d 3 W.\nLaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a75.3(c), p. 216 (5th ed. 2012).\nTo that end, courts have confirmed that the Fourth\nAmendment allows police to take certain routine \u201cadmin\u00ad\nistrative steps incident to arrest\u2014i.e., . . . book[ing], pho\u00ad\ntograph[ing], and fingerprint[ing].\u201d      McLaughlin, 500\nU. S., at 58. DNA identification of arrestees, of the type\napproved by the Maryland statute here at issue, is \u201cno\nmore than an extension of methods of identification long\nused in dealing with persons under arrest.\u201d Kelly, 55\nF. 2d, at 69. In the balance of reasonableness required by\nthe Fourth Amendment, therefore, the Court must give\ngreat weight both to the significant government interest at\nstake in the identification of arrestees and to the un\u00ad\nmatched potential of DNA identification to serve that\ninterest.\n                           V\n\n                           A\n\n  By comparison to this substantial government interest\nand the unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the\nintrusion of a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is a\n24                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nminimal one. True, a significant government interest does\nnot alone suffice to justify a search. The government\ninterest must outweigh the degree to which the search in\u00ad\nvades an individual\u2019s legitimate expectations of privacy.\nIn considering those expectations in this case, however,\nthe necessary predicate of a valid arrest for a serious\noffense is fundamental. \u201cAlthough the underlying com\u00ad\nmand of the Fourth Amendment is always that searches\nand seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on\nthe context within which a search takes place.\u201d New\nJersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 337 (1985). \u201c[T]he legiti\u00ad\nmacy of certain privacy expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the State\nmay depend upon the individual\u2019s legal relationship with\nthe State.\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515 U. S., at 654.\n   The reasonableness of any search must be considered\nin the context of the person\u2019s legitimate expectations of\nprivacy. For example, when weighing the invasiveness of\nurinalysis of high school athletes, the Court noted that\n\u201c[l]egitimate privacy expectations are even less with re\u00ad\ngard to student athletes. . . . Public school locker rooms,\nthe usual sites for these activities, are not notable for the\nprivacy they afford.\u201d Id., at 657. Likewise, the Court\nhas used a context-specific benchmark inapplicable to the\npublic at large when \u201cthe expectations of privacy of cov\u00ad\nered employees are diminished by reason of their participa\u00ad\ntion in an industry that is regulated pervasively,\u201d Skinner,\n489 U. S., at 627, or when \u201cthe \u2018operational realities of\nthe workplace\u2019 may render entirely reasonable certain\nwork-related intrusions by supervisors and co-workers\nthat might be viewed as unreasonable in other contexts,\u201d\nVon Raab, 489 U. S., at 671.\n   The expectations of privacy of an individual taken into\npolice custody \u201cnecessarily [are] of a diminished scope.\u201d\nBell, 441 U. S., at 557. \u201c[B]oth the person and the property\nin his immediate possession may be searched at the\nstation house.\u201d United States v. Edwards, 415 U. S. 800,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             25\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n803 (1974). A search of the detainee\u2019s person when he is\nbooked into custody may \u201c \u2018involve a relatively extensive\nexploration,\u2019 \u201d Robinson, 414 U. S., at 227, including \u201cre\u00ad\nquir[ing] at least some detainees to lift their genitals or\ncough in a squatting position,\u201d Florence, 566 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 13).\n   In this critical respect, the search here at issue differs\nfrom the sort of programmatic searches of either the public\nat large or a particular class of regulated but otherwise\nlaw-abiding citizens that the Court has previously labeled\nas \u201c \u2018special needs\u2019 \u201d searches. Chandler v. Miller, 520\nU. S. 305, 314 (1997). When the police stop a motorist at\na checkpoint, see Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U. S. 32\n(2000), or test a political candidate for illegal narcotics, see\nChandler, supra, they intrude upon substantial expecta\u00ad\ntions of privacy. So the Court has insisted on some pur\u00ad\npose other than \u201cto detect evidence of ordinary criminal\nwrongdoing\u201d to justify these searches in the absence of\nindividualized suspicion. Edmond, supra, at 38. Once an\nindividual has been arrested on probable cause for a dan\u00ad\ngerous offense that may require detention before trial,\nhowever, his or her expectations of privacy and freedom\nfrom police scrutiny are reduced. DNA identification like\nthat at issue here thus does not require consideration of\nany unique needs that would be required to justify search\u00ad\ning the average citizen. The special needs cases, though\nin full accord with the result reached here, do not have a\ndirect bearing on the issues presented in this case, be\u00ad\ncause unlike the search of a citizen who has not been\nsuspected of a wrong, a detainee has a reduced expectation\nof privacy.\n   The reasonableness inquiry here considers two other\ncircumstances in which the Court has held that particular\u00ad\nized suspicion is not categorically required: \u201cdiminished\nexpectations of privacy [and] minimal intrusions.\u201d McAr-\nthur, 531 U. S., at 330. This is not to suggest that any\n26                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsearch is acceptable solely because a person is in custody.\nSome searches, such as invasive surgery, see Winston, 470\nU. S. 753, or a search of the arrestee\u2019s home, see Chimel v.\nCalifornia, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), involve either greater\nintrusions or higher expectations of privacy than are\npresent in this case. In those situations, when the Court\nmust \u201cbalance the privacy-related and law enforcement\u00ad\nrelated concerns to determine if the intrusion was rea\u00ad\nsonable,\u201d McArthur, supra, at 331, the privacy-related\nconcerns are weighty enough that the search may require a\nwarrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of\nprivacy of the arrestee.\n  Here, by contrast to the approved standard procedures\nincident to any arrest detailed above, a buccal swab in\u00ad\nvolves an even more brief and still minimal intrusion. A\ngentle rub along the inside of the cheek does not break the\nskin, and it \u201cinvolves virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.\u201d\nSchmerber, 384 U. S., at 771. \u201cA crucial factor in analyz\u00ad\ning the magnitude of the intrusion . . . is the extent to\nwhich the procedure may threaten the safety or health of\nthe individual,\u201d Winston, supra, at 761, and nothing sug\u00ad\ngests that a buccal swab poses any physical danger what\u00ad\nsoever. A brief intrusion of an arrestee\u2019s person is subject\nto the Fourth Amendment, but a swab of this nature does\nnot increase the indignity already attendant to normal\nincidents of arrest.\n                             B\n  In addition the processing of respondent\u2019s DNA sam\u00ad\nple\u2019s 13 CODIS loci did not intrude on respondent\u2019s privacy\nin a way that would make his DNA identification\nunconstitutional.\n  First, as already noted, the CODIS loci come from non\u00ad\ncoding parts of the DNA that do not reveal the genetic\ntraits of the arrestee. While science can always progress\nfurther, and those progressions may have Fourth Amend\u00ad\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nment consequences, alleles at the CODIS loci \u201care not\nat present revealing information beyond identification.\u201d\nKatsanis & Wagner, Characterization of the Standard and\nRecommended CODIS Markers, 58 J. Forensic Sci. S169,\nS171 (2013). The argument that the testing at issue in\nthis case reveals any private medical information at all is\nopen to dispute.\n   And even if non-coding alleles could provide some in\u00ad\nformation, they are not in fact tested for that end. It is\nundisputed that law enforcement officers analyze DNA for\nthe sole purpose of generating a unique identifying num\u00ad\nber against which future samples may be matched. This\nparallels a similar safeguard based on actual practice in\nthe school drug-testing context, where the Court deemed it\n\u201csignificant that the tests at issue here look only for drugs,\nand not for whether the student is, for example, epileptic,\npregnant, or diabetic.\u201d Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515\nU. S., at 658. If in the future police analyze samples to\ndetermine, for instance, an arrestee\u2019s predisposition for a\nparticular disease or other hereditary factors not relevant\nto identity, that case would present additional privacy\nconcerns not present here.\n   Finally, the Act provides statutory protections that\nguard against further invasion of privacy. As noted above,\nthe Act requires that \u201c[o]nly DNA records that directly\nrelate to the identification of individuals shall be collected\nand stored.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \u00a72\u2013505(b)(1). No\npurpose other than identification is permissible: \u201cA person\nmay not willfully test a DNA sample for information that\ndoes not relate to the identification of individuals as speci\u00ad\nfied in this subtitle.\u201d \u00a72\u2013512(c). This Court has noted\noften that \u201ca \u2018statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwar\u00ad\nranted disclosures\u2019 generally allays . . . privacy concerns.\u201d\nNASA v. Nelson, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 20)\n(quoting Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 605 (1977)). The\nCourt need not speculate about the risks posed \u201cby a\n28                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsystem that did not contain comparable security provi\u00ad\nsions.\u201d Id., at 606. In light of the scientific and statutory\nsafeguards, once respondent\u2019s DNA was lawfully collected\nthe STR analysis of respondent\u2019s DNA pursuant to CODIS\nprocedures did not amount to a significant invasion of\nprivacy that would render the DNA identification imper\u00ad\nmissible under the Fourth Amendment.\n                         *    *     *\n   In light of the context of a valid arrest supported by\nprobable cause respondent\u2019s expectations of privacy were\nnot offended by the minor intrusion of a brief swab of his\ncheeks. By contrast, that same context of arrest gives rise\nto significant state interests in identifying respondent not\nonly so that the proper name can be attached to his charges\nbut also so that the criminal justice system can make\ninformed decisions concerning pretrial custody. Upon\nthese considerations the Court concludes that DNA identi\u00ad\nfication of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be\nconsidered part of a routine booking procedure. When\nofficers make an arrest supported by probable cause to\nhold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the\nstation to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a\ncheek swab of the arrestee\u2019s DNA is, like fingerprinting\nand photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure\nthat is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is\nreversed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

That prohibition is categorical and with-\nout exception; it lies at the very heart of the Fourth\nAmendment. Whenever this Court has allowed a suspi-\ncionless search, it has insisted upon a justifying motive\napart from the investigation of crime.\n  It is obvious that no such noninvestigative motive exists\nin this case. The Court\u2019s assertion that DNA is being\ntaken, not to solve crimes, but to identify those in the\nState\u2019s custody, taxes the credulity of the credulous. And\nthe Court\u2019s comparison of Maryland\u2019s DNA searches to\nother techniques, such as fingerprinting, can seem apt\nonly to those who know no more than today\u2019s opinion\nhas chosen to tell them about how those DNA searches\nactually work.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  At the time of the Founding, Americans despised the\nBritish use of so-called \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d\u2014warrants not\ngrounded upon a sworn oath of a specific infraction by a\nparticular individual, and thus not limited in scope and\n2                    MARYLAND v.

Even the common name for\nsuspicionless searches\u2014\u201cspecial needs\u201d searches\u2014itself\nreflects that they must be justified, always, by concerns\n\u201cother than crime detection.\u201d Chandler, supra, at 313\u2013\n314.

It is only when a gov-\nernmental purpose aside from crime-solving is at stake\nthat we engage in the free-form \u201creasonableness\u201d inquiry\nthat the Court indulges at length today. To put it another\nway, both the legitimacy of the Court\u2019s method and the\ncorrectness of its outcome hinge entirely on the truth of a\nsingle proposition: that the primary purpose of these DNA\n4                    MARYLAND v.

As I detail below, that\nproposition is wrong.\n                                B\n  The Court alludes at several points (see ante, at 11, 25)\nto the fact that King was an arrestee, and arrestees may\nbe validly searched incident to their arrest. But the Court\ndoes not really rest on this principle, and for good reason:\nThe objects of a search incident to arrest must be either (1)\nweapons or evidence that might easily be destroyed, or (2)\nevidence relevant to the crime of arrest. See Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. 332, 343\u2013344 (2009); Thornton v. United\nStates, 541 U. S. 615, 632 (2004) (SCALIA, J., concurring in\njudgment). Neither is the object of the search at issue\nhere.\n  The Court hastens to clarify that it does not mean to\napprove invasive surgery on arrestees or warrantless\nsearches of their homes. Ante, at 25. That the Court feels\nthe need to disclaim these consequences is as damning a\ncriticism of its suspicionless-search regime as any I can\nmuster. And the Court\u2019s attempt to distinguish those\nhypothetical searches from this real one is unconvincing.\nWe are told that the \u201cprivacy-related concerns\u201d in the\nsearch of a home \u201care weighty enough that the search may\nrequire a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expec-\ntations of privacy of the arrestee.\u201d Ante, at 26. But why\nare the \u201cprivacy-related concerns\u201d not also \u201cweighty\u201d when\nan intrusion into the body is at stake? (The Fourth\nAmendment lists \u201cpersons\u201d first among the entities pro-\ntected against unreasonable searches and seizures.) And\ncould the police engage, without any suspicion of wrongdo-\ning, in a \u201cbrief and . . . minimal\u201d intrusion into the home of\nan arrestee\u2014perhaps just peeking around the curtilage a\nbit? See ante, at 26. Obviously not.\n  At any rate, all this discussion is beside the point. No\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      5\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nmatter the degree of invasiveness, suspicionless searches\nare never allowed if their principal end is ordinary crime-\nsolving. A search incident to arrest either serves other\nends (such as officer safety, in a search for weapons) or\nis not suspicionless (as when there is reason to believe\nthe arrestee possesses evidence relevant to the crime of\narrest).\n   Sensing (correctly) that it needs more, the Court elabo-\nrates at length the ways that the search here served the\nspecial purpose of \u201cidentifying\u201d King.1 But that seems to\nme quite wrong\u2014unless what one means by \u201cidentifying\u201d\nsomeone is \u201csearching for evidence that he has committed\ncrimes unrelated to the crime of his arrest.\u201d At points the\nCourt does appear to use \u201cidentifying\u201d in that peculiar\nsense\u2014claiming, for example, that knowing \u201can arrestee\u2019s\npast conduct is essential to an assessment of the danger\nhe poses.\u201d Ante, at 15. If identifying someone means\nfinding out what unsolved crimes he has committed, then\nidentification is indistinguishable from the ordinary law-\nenforcement aims that have never been thought to justify\na suspicionless search. Searching every lawfully stopped\ncar, for example, might turn up information about un-\nsolved crimes the driver had committed, but no one would\nsay that such a search was aimed at \u201cidentifying\u201d him, and\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Court\u2019s insistence (ante, at 25) that our special-needs cases \u201cdo\nnot have a direct bearing on the issues presented in this case\u201d is per-\nplexing. Why spill so much ink on the special need of identification if a\nspecial need is not required? Why not just come out and say that any\nsuspicionless search of an arrestee is allowed if it will be useful to solve\ncrimes? The Court does not say that because most Members of the\nCourt do not believe it. So whatever the Court\u2019s major premise\u2014the\nopinion does not really contain what you would call a rule of decision\u2014\nthe minor premise is \u201cthis search was used to identify King.\u201d The\nincorrectness of that minor premise will therefore suffice to demon-\nstrate the error in the Court\u2019s result.\n6                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nno court would hold such a search lawful. I will therefore\nassume that the Court means that the DNA search at\nissue here was useful to \u201cidentify\u201d King in the normal\nsense of that word\u2014in the sense that would identify the\nauthor of Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\nLegislation as Jeremy Bentham.\n                              1\n   The portion of the Court\u2019s opinion that explains the\nidentification rationale is strangely silent on the actual\nworkings of the DNA search at issue here. To know those\nfacts is to be instantly disabused of the notion that what\nhappened had anything to do with identifying King.\n   King was arrested on April 10, 2009, on charges unre-\nlated to the case before us. That same day, April 10, the\npolice searched him and seized the DNA evidence at issue\nhere. What happened next? Reading the Court\u2019s opinion,\nparticularly its insistence that the search was necessary to\nknow \u201cwho [had] been arrested,\u201d ante, at 11, one might\nguess that King\u2019s DNA was swiftly processed and his\nidentity thereby confirmed\u2014perhaps against some master\ndatabase of known DNA profiles, as is done for finger-\nprints. After all, was not the suspicionless search here\ncrucial to avoid \u201cinordinate risks for facility staff\u201d or to\n\u201cexisting detainee population,\u201d ante, at 14? Surely, then\u2014\nsurely\u2014the State of Maryland got cracking on those grave\nrisks immediately, by rushing to identify King with his\nDNA as soon as possible.\n   Nothing could be further from the truth. Maryland\nofficials did not even begin the process of testing King\u2019s\nDNA that day. Or, actually, the next day. Or the day\nafter that. And that was for a simple reason: Maryland\nlaw forbids them to do so. A \u201cDNA sample collected from\nan individual charged with a crime . . . may not be tested\nor placed in the statewide DNA data base system prior to\nthe first scheduled arraignment date.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf. Code\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nAnn. \u00a72\u2013504(d)(1) (Lexis 2011) (emphasis added). And\nKing\u2019s first appearance in court was not until three days\nafter his arrest. (I suspect, though, that they did not wait\nthree days to ask his name or take his fingerprints.)\n  This places in a rather different light the Court\u2019s solemn\ndeclaration that the search here was necessary so that\nKing could be identified at \u201cevery stage of the criminal\nprocess.\u201d Ante, at 18. I hope that the Maryland officials\nwho read the Court\u2019s opinion do not take it seriously.\nActing on the Court\u2019s misperception of Maryland law could\nlead to jail time. See Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \u00a72\u2013512(c)\u2013(e)\n(punishing by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment anyone who\nobtains or tests DNA information except as provided by\nstatute). Does the Court really believe that Maryland\ndid not know whom it was arraigning? The Court\u2019s re-\nsponse is to imagine that release on bail could take so long\nthat the DNA results are returned in time, or perhaps that\nbail could be revoked if the DNA test turned up incrimi-\nnating information. Ante, at 16\u201317. That is no answer at\nall. If the purpose of this Act is to assess \u201cwhether [King]\nshould be released on bail,\u201d ante, at 15, why would it\npossibly forbid the DNA testing process to begin until King\nwas arraigned? Why would Maryland resign itself to\nsimply hoping that the bail decision will drag out long\nenough that the \u201cidentification\u201d can succeed before the\narrestee is released? The truth, known to Maryland and\nincreasingly to the reader: this search had nothing to do\nwith establishing King\u2019s identity.\n  It gets worse. King\u2019s DNA sample was not received by\nthe Maryland State Police\u2019s Forensic Sciences Division\nuntil April 23, 2009\u2014two weeks after his arrest. It sat in\nthat office, ripening in a storage area, until the custodians\ngot around to mailing it to a lab for testing on June 25,\n2009\u2014two months after it was received, and nearly three\nsince King\u2019s arrest. After it was mailed, the data from the\nlab tests were not available for several more weeks, until\n8                   MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nJuly 13, 2009, which is when the test results were entered\ninto Maryland\u2019s DNA database, together with information\nidentifying the person from whom the sample was taken.\nMeanwhile, bail had been set, King had engaged in dis-\ncovery, and he had requested a speedy trial\u2014presumably\nnot a trial of John Doe. It was not until August 4, 2009\u2014\nfour months after King\u2019s arrest\u2014that the forwarded sam-\nple transmitted (without identifying information) from the\nMaryland DNA database to the Federal Bureau of Investi-\ngation\u2019s national database was matched with a sample\ntaken from the scene of an unrelated crime years earlier.\n   A more specific description of exactly what happened at\nthis point illustrates why, by definition, King could\nnot have been identified by this match. The FBI\u2019s\nDNA database (known as CODIS) consists of two distinct\ncollections. FBI, CODIS and NDIS Fact Sheet, http://\nwww.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet\n(all Internet materials as visited May 31, 2013, and avail-\nable in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). One of them, the one to\nwhich King\u2019s DNA was submitted, consists of DNA sam-\nples taken from known convicts or arrestees. I will refer\nto this as the \u201cConvict and Arrestee Collection.\u201d The other\ncollection consists of samples taken from crime scenes; I\nwill refer to this as the \u201cUnsolved Crimes Collection.\u201d The\nConvict and Arrestee Collection stores \u201cno names or other\npersonal identifiers of the offenders, arrestees, or detain-\nees.\u201d Ibid. Rather, it contains only the DNA profile itself,\nthe name of the agency that submitted it, the laboratory\npersonnel who analyzed it, and an identification number\nfor the specimen. Ibid. This is because the submitting\nstate laboratories are expected already to know the identi-\nties of the convicts and arrestees from whom samples are\ntaken. (And, of course, they do.)\n   Moreover, the CODIS system works by checking to see\nwhether any of the samples in the Unsolved Crimes Col-\nlection match any of the samples in the Convict and Ar-\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                         SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nrestee Collection. Ibid. That is sensible, if what one\nwants to do is solve those cold cases, but note what it\nrequires: that the identity of the people whose DNA has\nbeen entered in the Convict and Arrestee Collection al-\nready be known.2 If one wanted to identify someone in\ncustody using his DNA, the logical thing to do would be to\ncompare that DNA against the Convict and Arrestee\nCollection: to search, in other words, the collection that\ncould be used (by checking back with the submitting\nstate agency) to identify people, rather than the collection\nof evidence from unsolved crimes, whose perpetrators are\nby definition unknown. But that is not what was done.\nAnd that is because this search had nothing to do with\nidentification.\n  In fact, if anything was \u201cidentified\u201d at the moment that\nthe DNA database returned a match, it was not King\u2014his\nidentity was already known. (The docket for the original\ncriminal charges lists his full name, his race, his sex, his\nheight, his weight, his date of birth, and his address.)\nRather, what the August 4 match \u201cidentified\u201d was the\npreviously-taken sample from the earlier crime. That\nsample was genuinely mysterious to Maryland; the State\nknew that it had probably been left by the victim\u2019s attack-\ner, but nothing else. King was not identified by his associ-\nation with the sample; rather, the sample was identified\nby its association with King. The Court effectively de-\nstroys its own \u201cidentification\u201d theory when it acknowledges\nthat the object of this search was \u201cto see what [was] al-\nready known about [King].\u201d King was who he was, and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 By the way, this procedure has nothing to do with exonerating the\n\nwrongfully convicted, as the Court soothingly promises. See ante, at 17.\nThe FBI CODIS database includes DNA from unsolved crimes. I know\nof no indication (and the Court cites none) that it also includes DNA\nfrom all\u2014or even any\u2014crimes whose perpetrators have already been\nconvicted.\n10                  MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvolumes of his biography could not make him any more or\nany less King. No minimally competent speaker of Eng-\nlish would say, upon noticing a known arrestee\u2019s similarity\n\u201cto a wanted poster of a previously unidentified suspect,\u201d\nante, at 13, that the arrestee had thereby been identified.\nIt was the previously unidentified suspect who had been\nidentified\u2014just as, here, it was the previously unidentified\nrapist.\n                               2\n   That taking DNA samples from arrestees has nothing to\ndo with identifying them is confirmed not just by actual\npractice (which the Court ignores) but by the enabling\nstatute itself (which the Court also ignores). The Mary-\nland Act at issue has a section helpfully entitled \u201cPurpose\nof collecting and testing DNA samples.\u201d Md. Pub. Saf.\nCode Ann. \u00a72\u2013505. (One would expect such a section to\nplay a somewhat larger role in the Court\u2019s analysis of the\nAct\u2019s purpose\u2014which is to say, at least some role.) That\nprovision lists five purposes for which DNA samples may\nbe tested. By this point, it will not surprise the reader to\nlearn that the Court\u2019s imagined purpose is not among\nthem.\n   Instead, the law provides that DNA samples are collected\nand tested, as a matter of Maryland law, \u201cas part of an\nofficial investigation into a crime.\u201d \u00a72\u2013505(a)(2). (Or, as\nour suspicionless-search cases would put it: for ordinary\nlaw-enforcement purposes.) That is certainly how every-\none has always understood the Maryland Act until today.\nThe Governor of Maryland, in commenting on our deci-\nsion to hear this case, said that he was glad, because\n\u201c[a]llowing law enforcement to collect DNA samples . . . is\nabsolutely critical to our efforts to continue driving down\ncrime,\u201d and \u201cbolsters our efforts to resolve open investiga-\ntions and bring them to a resolution.\u201d Marbella, Supreme\nCourt Will Review Md.

Even this Court\u2019s order staying the\ndecision below states that the statute \u201cprovides a valuable\ntool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping\nto remove violent offenders from the general population\u201d\u2014\nwith, unsurprisingly, no mention of identity. 567 U. S.\n___, ___ (2012) (ROBERTS, C. J., in chambers) (slip op.,\nat 3).\n   More devastating still for the Court\u2019s \u201cidentification\u201d\ntheory, the statute does enumerate two instances in which\na DNA sample may be tested for the purpose of identifica-\ntion: \u201cto help identify human remains,\u201d \u00a72\u2013505(a)(3) (em-\nphasis added), and \u201cto help identify missing individuals,\u201d\n\u00a72\u2013505(a)(4) (emphasis added). No mention of identifying\narrestees. Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. And note\nagain that Maryland forbids using DNA records \u201cfor any\npurposes other than those specified\u201d\u2014it is actually a crime\nto do so. \u00a72\u2013505(b)(2).\n   The Maryland regulations implementing the Act con-\nfirm what is now monotonously obvious: These DNA\nsearches have nothing to do with identification. For ex-\nample, if someone is arrested and law enforcement deter-\nmines that \u201ca convicted offender Statewide DNA Data\nBase sample already exists\u201d for that arrestee, \u201cthe agency\nis not required to obtain a new sample.\u201d Code of Md.\nRegs., tit. 29, \u00a705.01.04(B)(4) (2011). But how could the\nState know if an arrestee has already had his DNA sample\ncollected, if the point of the sample is to identify who he is?\nOf course, if the DNA sample is instead taken in order to\ninvestigate crimes, this restriction makes perfect sense:\nHaving previously placed an identified someone\u2019s DNA on\nfile to check against available crime-scene evidence, there\nis no sense in going to the expense of taking a new sample.\n12                    MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nMaryland\u2019s regulations further require that the \u201cindivid-\nual collecting a sample . . . verify the identity of the indi-\nvidual from whom a sample is taken by name and,\nif applicable, State identification (SID) number.\u201d\n\u00a705.01.04(K). (But how?) And after the sample is taken, it\ncontinues to be identified by the individual\u2019s name, finger-\nprints, etc., see \u00a705.01.07(B)\u2014rather than (as the Court\nbelieves) being used to identify individuals.                See\n\u00a705.01.07(B)(2) (\u201cRecords and specimen information shall\nbe identified by . . . [the] [n]ame of the donor\u201d (emphasis\nadded)).\n  So, to review: DNA testing does not even begin until\nafter arraignment and bail decisions are already made.\nThe samples sit in storage for months, and take weeks to\ntest. When they are tested, they are checked against the\nUnsolved Crimes Collection\u2014rather than the Convict and\nArrestee Collection, which could be used to identify them.\nThe Act forbids the Court\u2019s purpose (identification), but\nprescribes as its purpose what our suspicionless-search\ncases forbid (\u201cofficial investigation into a crime\u201d). Against\nall of that, it is safe to say that if the Court\u2019s identification\ntheory is not wrong, there is no such thing as error.\n                             II\n  The Court also attempts to bolster its identification\ntheory with a series of inapposite analogies. See ante, at\n18\u201323.\n  Is not taking DNA samples the same, asks the Court, as\ntaking a person\u2019s photograph? No\u2014because that is not a\nFourth Amendment search at all. It does not involve a\nphysical intrusion onto the person, see Florida v.\nJardines, 569 U.

C.\n417 (1904) (Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination).\n   But is not the practice of DNA searches, the Court asks,\nthe same as taking \u201cBertillon\u201d measurements\u2014noting an\narrestee\u2019s height, shoe size, and so on, on the back of a\nphotograph? No, because that system was not, in the\nordinary case, used to solve unsolved crimes. It is possi-\nble, I suppose, to imagine situations in which such meas-\nurements might be useful to generate leads. (If witnesses\ndescribed a very tall burglar, all the \u201ctall man\u201d cards could\nthen be pulled.) But the obvious primary purpose of such\nmeasurements, as the Court\u2019s description of them makes\nclear, was to verify that, for example, the person arrested\ntoday is the same person that was arrested a year ago.\nWhich is to say, Bertillon measurements were actually\nused as a system of identification, and drew their primary\nusefulness from that task.3\n   It is on the fingerprinting of arrestees, however, that the\nCourt relies most heavily. Ante, at 20\u201323. The Court does\nnot actually say whether it believes that taking a person\u2019s\nfingerprints is a Fourth Amendment search, and our cases\nprovide no ready answer to that question. Even assuming\nso, however, law enforcement\u2019s post-arrest use of finger-\nprints could not be more different from its post-arrest\nuse of DNA. Fingerprints of arrestees are taken primarily\nto identify them (though that process sometimes solves\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Puzzlingly, the Court\u2019s discussion of photography and Bertillon\n\nmeasurements repeatedly cites state cases (such as Clausmier) that\nwere decided before the Fourth Amendment was held to be applicable\nto the States. See Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949); Mapp v. Ohio,\n367 U. S. 643 (1961).

Ante, at 22.\nThis bold statement is bereft of citation to authority\nbecause there is none for it. The \u201cgreat expansion in finger-\nprinting came before the modern era of Fourth Amend-\nment jurisprudence,\u201d and so we were never asked to decide\nthe legitimacy of the practice. United States v. Kincade,\n379 F. 3d 813, 874 (CA9 2004) (Kozinski, J., dissenting).\nAs fingerprint databases expanded from convicted\ncriminals, to arrestees, to civil servants, to immigrants,\nto everyone with a driver\u2019s license, Americans simply\n\u201cbecame accustomed to having our fingerprints on file\nin some government database.\u201d Ibid. But it is wrong\nto suggest that this was uncontroversial at the time, or\nthat this Court blessed universal fingerprinting for\n\u201cgenerations\u201d before it was possible to use it effectively for\nidentification.\n   The Court also assures us that \u201cthe delay in processing\nDNA from arrestees is being reduced to a substantial\ndegree by rapid technical advances.\u201d Ante, at 22. The\nidea, presumably, is that the snail\u2019s pace in this case is\natypical, so that DNA is now readily usable for identifica-\ntion. The Court\u2019s proof, however, is nothing but a pair of\npress releases\u2014each of which turns out to undercut this\nargument. We learn in them that reductions in backlog\nhave enabled Ohio and Louisiana crime labs to analyze a\nsubmitted DNA sample in twenty days.5 But that is still\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nhttp://www.fbi.gov/foia/privacy-impact-assessments/iafis-ngi-risc (searches\nof the \u201cUnsolved Latent File\u201d may \u201ctake considerably more time\u201d).\n   5 See Attorney General DeWine Announces Significant Drop in\n\nDNA Turnaround Time (Jan. 4, 2013), http://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/\nMedia/News-Releases/January-2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-\nSignificant-Drop; Gov.

KING\n\n                       SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nlonger than the eighteen days that Maryland needed to\nanalyze King\u2019s sample, once it worked its way through the\nState\u2019s labyrinthine bureaucracy. What this illustrates is\nthat these times do not take into account the many other\nsources of delay. So if the Court means to suggest that\nMaryland is unusual, that may be right\u2014it may qualify in\nthis context as a paragon of efficiency. (Indeed, the Gov-\nernor of Maryland was hailing the elimination of that\nState\u2019s backlog more than five years ago. See Wheeler,\nO\u2019Malley Wants to Expand DNA Testing, Baltimore Sun,\nJan. 11, 2008, p. 5B.) Meanwhile, the Court\u2019s holding\nwill result in the dumping of a large number of arrestee\nsamples\u2014many from minor offenders\u2014onto an already over-\nburdened system: Nearly one-third of Americans will be\narrested for some offense by age 23. See Brame, Turner,\nPaternoster, & Bushway, Cumulative Prevalence of Arrest\nFrom Ages 8 to 23 in a National Sample, 129 Pediatrics 21\n(2011).\n  The Court also accepts uncritically the Government\u2019s\nrepresentation at oral argument that it is developing\ndevices that will be able to test DNA in mere minutes. At\nmost, this demonstrates that it may one day be possible to\ndesign a program that uses DNA for a purpose other than\ncrime-solving\u2014not that Maryland has in fact designed\nsuch a program today. And that is the main point, which\nthe Court\u2019s discussion of the brave new world of instant\nDNA analysis should not obscure. The issue before us is\nnot whether DNA can some day be used for identification;\nnor even whether it can today be used for identification;\nbut whether it was used for identification here.\n  Today, it can fairly be said that fingerprints really are\nused to identify people\u2014so well, in fact, that there would\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\n(Nov. 17, 2011), http://www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom& \n\ntmp=detail&articleID=3102.\n\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

What DNA\nadds\u2014what makes it a valuable weapon in the law-\nenforcement arsenal\u2014is the ability to solve unsolved\ncrimes, by matching old crime-scene evidence against the\nprofiles of people whose identities are already known.\nThat is what was going on when King\u2019s DNA was taken,\nand we should not disguise the fact. Solving unsolved\ncrimes is a noble objective, but it occupies a lower place in\nthe American pantheon of noble objectives than the pro-\ntection of our people from suspicionless law-enforcement\nsearches. The Fourth Amendment must prevail.\n                          *    *   *\n   The Court disguises the vast (and scary) scope of its\nholding by promising a limitation it cannot deliver. The\nCourt repeatedly says that DNA testing, and entry into a\nnational DNA registry, will not befall thee and me, dear\nreader, but only those arrested for \u201cserious offense[s].\u201d\nAnte, at 28; see also ante, at 1, 9, 14, 17, 22, 23, 24 (re-\npeatedly limiting the analysis to \u201cserious offenses\u201d). I\ncannot imagine what principle could possibly justify this\nlimitation, and the Court does not attempt to suggest any.\nIf one believes that DNA will \u201cidentify\u201d someone arrested\nfor assault, he must believe that it will \u201cidentify\u201d someone\narrested for a traffic offense. This Court does not base its\njudgments on senseless distinctions. At the end of the\nday, logic will out. When there comes before us the taking\nof DNA from an arrestee for a traffic violation, the Court\nwill predictably (and quite rightly) say, \u201cWe can find no\nsignificant difference between this case and King.\u201d Make\nno mistake about it: As an entirely predictable conse-\nquence of today\u2019s decision, your DNA can be taken and\nentered into a national DNA database if you are ever\narrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.\n   The most regrettable aspect of the suspicionless search\n18                     MARYLAND v. KING\n\n                        SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthat occurred here is that it proved to be quite unneces-\nsary. All parties concede that it would have been entirely\npermissible, as far as the Fourth Amendment is con-\ncerned, for Maryland to take a sample of King\u2019s DNA as a\nconsequence of his conviction for second-degree assault.\nSo the ironic result of the Court\u2019s error is this: The only\narrestees to whom the outcome here will ever make a\ndifference are those who have been acquitted of the crime\nof arrest (so that their DNA could not have been taken\nupon conviction). In other words, this Act manages to\nburden uniquely the sole group for whom the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s protections ought to be most jealously\nguarded: people who are innocent of the State\u2019s accusations.\n   Today\u2019s judgment will, to be sure, have the beneficial\neffect of solving more crimes; then again, so would the\ntaking of DNA samples from anyone who flies on an air-\nplane (surely the Transportation Security Administration\nneeds to know the \u201cidentity\u201d of the flying public), applies\nfor a driver\u2019s license, or attends a public school. Perhaps\nthe construction of such a genetic panopticon is wise. But\nI doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our\nliberties would have been so eager to open their mouths\nfor royal inspection.\n   I therefore dissent, and hope that today\u2019s incursion upon\nthe Fourth Amendment, like an earlier one,6 will some day\nbe repudiated.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Compare, New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981) (suspicionless\n\nsearch of a car permitted upon arrest of the driver), with Arizona v.\nGant, 556 U. S. 332 (2009) (on second thought, no).\n</pre>",
