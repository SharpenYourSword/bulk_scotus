UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12–62. Argued February 26, 2013—Decided June 10, 2013\nPetitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct\n  that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing, he argued that the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\n  version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of\n  his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time\n  of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh’s sentencing range\n  was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe\n  consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The\n  District Court rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and sentenced him\n  to 70 months’ imprisonment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n675 F. 3d 736, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part III–C, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when\n  a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he\n  committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher\n  sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\n  Pp. 4–13, 15–20.\n    (a) Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 543\n  U. S. 220, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing\n  procedures. A district court must begin “by correctly calculating the\n  applicable Guidelines range,” Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49,\n  and then consider the parties’ arguments and factors specified in 18\n  U. S. C. §3553(a). 552 U. S., at 49–50. The court “may not presume\n  that the Guidelines range is reasonable,” id., at 50, and must explain\n  the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid. On appeal, a sentence is\n  reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n2                      PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 51. A district court is to apply the Guidelines “in effect on the\n    date the defendant is sentenced,” §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the\n    Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense\n    was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date\n    be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a cat-\n    egory including, as relevant here, “[e]very law that changes the pun-\n    ishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to\n    the crime, when committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. The\n    “scope of this Latin phrase” is given “substance by an accretion of\n    case law.” Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292. The touchstone of\n    the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient\n    risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\n    crimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250. Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.\n    423. There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the peti-\n    tioner was sentenced under Florida’s new sentencing guidelines,\n    which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place\n    at the time of his crime. The pre-existing guidelines would have re-\n    quired the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons\n    in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been re-\n    viewable on appeal. But under the new guidelines, a sentence within\n    the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.\n    Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the\n    ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sen-\n    tence. Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a\n    significant risk of a higher sentence.\n       The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing\n    scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentenc-\n    ing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines. Normally, a “judge will\n    use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and\n    impose a sentence within the range.” Freeman v. United States, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. That the court may impose a sentence outside that\n    range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for\n    sentencing. Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for rea-\n    sonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark. Appellate courts\n    may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v.\n    United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347, and may “consider the extent of the\n    deviation” from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness re-\n    view, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The sentencing regime also puts in place\n    procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-\n    Guidelines sentence less likely. Florida’s scheme and the federal re-\n    gime differ, but those differences are not dispositive. Common sense\n    indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evi-\n  dence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect. A retrospective\n  increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient\n  risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n  Pp. 9–13.\n     (d) The Government’s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Its\n  principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal\n  effect to attain the status of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex\n  Post Facto Clause. Changes in law need not bind a sentencing au-\n  thority for there to be an ex post facto violation, and “[t]he presence of\n  discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.” Garner,\n  529 U. S., at 253. As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines\n  and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two sys-\n  tems is one in degree, not in kind. The attributes of post-Booker sen-\n  tencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many per-\n  suasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.\n  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-\n  Booker Sixth Amendment cases. The Court’s Sixth Amendment cases,\n  which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a de-\n  fendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its\n  ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a\n  “significant risk” of a higher sentence. The Booker remedy was de-\n  signed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this\n  distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth\n  Amendment violation. Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of\n  such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall. Pp. 15–19.\n\n   SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nIII–C.

The U. S.\nSentencing Guidelines set forth an advisory sentencing\nrange for each defendant convicted in federal court. We\nconsider here whether there is an ex post facto violation\nwhen a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promul-\ngated after he committed his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing\nrange than the version in place at the time of the offense.\nWe hold that there is.\n                             I\n  Petitioner Marvin Peugh and his cousin, Steven Holle-\nwell, ran two farming-related businesses in Illinois. Grain-\nery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc.,\nprovided farming services to landowners and tenants.\n——————\n *JUSTICE KENNEDY joins this opinion except as to Part III–C.\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWhen the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow prob-\nlems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent\nschemes. First, they obtained a series of bank loans by\nrepresenting falsely the existence of contracts for future\ngrain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery. When\nthey failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the\nbank suffered losses of over $2 million. Second, they ar-\ntificially inflated the balances of accounts under their con-\ntrol by “check kiting,” or writing bad checks between their\naccounts. This scheme allowed them to overdraw an\naccount by $471,000. They engaged in their illicit conduct\nin 1999 and 2000.\n   When their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell\nwere charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation\nof 18 U. S. C. §1344. While Hollewell pleaded guilty to\none count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and\nwent to trial, where he testified that he had not intended\nto defraud the banks. The jury found him guilty of five\ncounts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining\ncounts.\n   At sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto\nClause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\nversion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at\nthe time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 ver-\nsion in effect at the time of sentencing. The two versions\nyielded significantly different results for Peugh’s applica-\nble Guidelines sentencing range. Under the 1998 Guide-\nlines, Peugh’s base offense level was 6. United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2F1.1 (Nov.\n1998) (USSG). Thirteen levels were added for a loss\namount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruc-\ntion of justice because of Peugh’s perjury at trial, see\nUSSG §3C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under\nthe 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19. As a first-time\noffender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and\nso his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto 37 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).\n  The 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sen-\ntenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to\nhis acts. First, the base offense level was raised from 6\nto 7 for crimes, like Peugh’s, that have a statutory maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. See USSG\n§2B1.1 (Nov. 2009); 18 U. S. C. §1344. Second, the en-\nhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a\n5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines. USSG 2B1.1\n(Nov. 2009). After adding the 2-level enhancement for\nobstruction of justice, Peugh’s total offense level under the\n2009 Guidelines was 27. With a Criminal History Cate-\ngory of I, Peugh’s sentencing range rose under the 2009\nGuidelines to 70 to 87 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.\n2009). The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33\nmonths higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines\nrange.\n  At the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected\nPeugh’s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines vio-\nlated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was fore-\nclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent. App. 30 (discussing\nUnited States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791 (2006)). The\nDistrict Court declined to give Peugh a downward vari-\nance, concluding that “a sentence within the [G]uideline[s]\nrange is the most appropriate sentence in this case,” App.\n100. It sentenced Peugh to 70 months’ imprisonment,\nibid., the bottom of the 2009 Guidelines range.\n  The Seventh Circuit, in keeping with its decision in\nDemaree, rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and affirmed\nhis conviction and sentence. 675 F. 3d 736 (2012). We\ngranted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the Ex Post Facto Clause may be\nviolated when a defendant is sentenced under the version\nof the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sen-\ntencing rather than the version in effect at the time the\ncrime was committed, and the newer Guidelines yield a\n4                   PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhigher applicable sentencing range.1 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nWe now reverse.\n                             II\n  Prior to 1984, the broad discretion of sentencing courts\nand parole officers had led to significant sentencing dis-\nparities among similarly situated offenders. To address\nthis problem, Congress created the United States Sentenc-\ning Commission. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n362, 366–367 (1989). The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n98 Stat. 1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and\ndirected the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uni-\nform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at\nsentencing. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. The Commission\nproduced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a sys-\ntem under which a set of inputs specific to a given case\n(the particular characteristics of the offense and offender)\nyielded a predetermined output (a range of months within\nwhich the defendant could be sentenced).\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 244 (2005),\nhowever, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran\nafoul of the Sixth Amendment by allowing judges to find\nfacts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond “the\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict.” See also Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The appropriate remedy for\nthis violation, the Court determined, was to strike those\nportions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory. Booker, 543 U. S., at 245–258.\nUnder the resulting scheme, a district court is still re-\n——————\n  1 Compare United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795 (CA7 2006),\n\nwith United States v.

See id., at 259–260, 264;\n18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A). But the Guidelines are no\nlonger binding, and the district court must consider all of\nthe factors set forth in §3553(a) to guide its discretion at\nsentencing, see Booker, 543 U. S., at 259–260, 264. The\nBooker remedy, “while not the system Congress enacted,”\nwas designed to “continue to move sentencing in Congress’\npreferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing\ndisparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to indi-\nvidualize sentences where necessary.” Id., at 264–265.\n   Our subsequent decisions have clarified the role that\nthe Guidelines play in sentencing procedures, both at the\ndistrict court level and when sentences are reviewed on\nappeal. First, “a district court should begin all sentencing\nproceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guide-\nlines range. As a matter of administration and to secure\nnationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the\nstarting point and the initial benchmark.” Gall v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted). The\ndistrict court must then consider the arguments of the par-\nties and the factors set forth in §3553(a). Id., at 49–50.\nThe district court “may not presume that the Guidelines\nrange is reasonable,” id., at 50; and it “may in appropriate\ncases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on dis-\nagreement with the [Sentencing] Commission’s views,” Pep-\nper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 23) (citing Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,\n109–110 (2007)). The district court must explain the basis\nfor its chosen sentence on the record. Gall, 552 U. S., at\n50. “[A] major departure [from the Guidelines] should be\nsupported by a more significant justification than a minor\none.” Ibid.\n   On appeal, the district court’s sentence is reviewed for\nreasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee id., at 51; Booker, 543 U. S., at 261–264. Failure to\ncalculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes proce-\n6                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndural error, as does treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\nGall, 552 U. S., at 51. The court of appeals may, but is\nnot required to, presume that a within-Guidelines sentence\nis reasonable. Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347\n(2007). The reviewing court may not apply a heightened\nstandard of review or a presumption of unreasonableness\nto sentences outside the Guidelines range, although it\n“will, of course, take into account the totality of the cir-\ncumstances, including the extent of any variance from the\nGuidelines range.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. We have in-\ndicated that “a district court’s decision to vary from the\nadvisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when” it\nis based on the particular facts of a case. Kimbrough, 552\nU. S., at 109.2 Overall, this system “requires a court to\ngive respectful consideration to the Guidelines,” but it\n“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other\nstatutory concerns as well.” Id., at 101 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Under 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), district courts are\ninstructed to apply the Sentencing Guidelines issued by\nthe United States Sentencing Commission that are “in\neffect on the date the defendant is sentenced.” The Sen-\ntencing Guidelines reiterate that statutory directive, with\nthe proviso that “[i]f the Court determines that use of the\nGuidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant\nis sentenced would violate the [E]x [P]ost [F]acto [C]lause\nof the United States Constitution, the court shall use the\nGuidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense\nof conviction was committed.” USSG §§1B1.11(a), (b)(1)\n——————\n  2 We have left open the question whether “closer [appellate] review [of\n\na non-Guidelines sentence] may be in order when the sentencing judge\nvaries from the Guidelines based solely on the judge’s view that the\nGuidelines range ‘fails properly to reflect §3553(a) considerations’ even\nin a mine-run case.” Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 109 (quoting Rita, 551\nU. S., at 351). Resolution of this case does not require us to assess the\nmerits of this issue.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Bull, Justice Chase reviewed the definition\nthat the term had acquired in English common law:\n    “1st. Every law that makes an action done before the\n    passing of the law, and which was innocent when\n    done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d.

UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlaws, those that “chang[e] the punishment, and inflic[t] a\ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,\nwhen committed.” 3 Dall., at 390. Peugh’s claim is that\nthe Clause was violated because the 2009 Guidelines call\nfor a greater punishment than attached to bank fraud in\n2000, when his crimes were completed. The Government\ncounters that because the more punitive Guidelines ap-\nplied at Peugh’s sentencing were only advisory, there was\nno ex post facto problem.\n   Each of the parties can point to prior decisions of this\nCourt that lend support to its view. On the one hand, we\nhave never accepted the proposition that a law must in-\ncrease the maximum sentence for which a defendant is\neligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See,\ne.g., Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937). More-\nover, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some\nmeasure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto\nclaim. See Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 253 (2000). On\nthe other hand, we have made it clear that mere specula-\ntion or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively\nincrease the punishment for a crime will not suffice to\nestablish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nCalifornia Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,\n509 (1995). The touchstone of this Court’s inquiry is\nwhether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.’ ” Garner, 529 U. S., at 250 (quoting Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S., at 509). The question when a change in\nlaw creates such a risk is “a matter of degree”; the test\ncannot be reduced to a “single formula.” Id., at 509 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE THOMAS, raising the issue on his own initiative, would reject\n\nour established Ex Post Facto Clause framework.

S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             B\n   The most relevant of our prior decisions for assessing\nwhether the requisite degree of risk is present here is\nMiller v. Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), in which this\nCourt considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing\nguidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.\nUnder Florida’s system, a calculation under the guidelines\nyielded a presumptive sentencing range. Id., at 426. This\nrange was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing\njudge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range\n“ ‘without the requirement of a written explanation.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)).\nIf the court wished to depart from the guidelines range,\nhowever, it was required to give “clear and convincing\nreasons in writing for doing so.” 482 U. S., at 426. A\nwithin-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a non-\nguidelines sentence was subject to appellate review. Ibid.\n   The petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new\nguidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than\nthe guidelines that had been in place at the time of his\ncrime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new\nrange. Ibid. This Court found an ex post facto violation.\nWe emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner’s\nsentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentenc-\ning judge would have been required to provide clear and\nconvincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the\nsentence would then have been reviewable on appeal. Id.,\nat 432. In contrast, because the sentence imposed was\nwithin the new guidelines range, it required no explana-\ntion and was unreviewable. Id., at 432–433. The fact that\nFlorida’s guidelines “create[d] a high hurdle that must be\ncleared before discretion can be exercised” was sufficient\nto render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law. Id.,\nat 435.\n   Miller thus establishes that applying amended sentenc-\ning guidelines that increase a defendant’s recommended\n10                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwith-\nstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion\nto deviate from the recommended sentencing range. The\nsentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sen-\ntences for similarly situated offenders into a specified\nrange. Its reason-giving requirements and standards of\nappellate review meant that while variation was possible,\nit was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defend-\nant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Under the\nFlorida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines\nrange applicable to an offender created a significant risk\nthat he would receive a higher sentence.4 The same prin-\nciples apply here.\n   The post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to\nachieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions\nare anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a\nmeaningful benchmark through the process of appellate\nreview. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107. As we have\ndescribed, “district courts must begin their analysis with\nthe Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout\nthe sentencing process.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50, n. 6 (em-\nphasis added). Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines\nrange constitutes procedural error. Id., at 51. A district\ncourt contemplating a non-Guidelines sentence “must con-\nsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\njustification is sufficiently compelling to support the de-\ngree of the variance.” Id., at 50.

S., at ___ (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 1) (“[T]he law permits the\n——————\n  4 Miller employed a “substantial disadvantage” test that this Court\n\nhas since abandoned. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,\n514 U. S. 499, 506–507, n. 3 (1995). The relevant question is whether\nthe change in law creates a “ ‘sufficient’ ” or “significant” risk of increas-\ning the punishment for a given crime. Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244,\n250, 251 (2000). As we have made clear, however, the result in Miller\nremains sound. See Morales, 514 U. S., at 506–507, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

S., at\n261–262)).\n   These requirements mean that “[i]n the usual sentenc-\ning, . . . the judge will use the Guidelines range as the\nstarting point in the analysis and impose a sentence within\nthe range.” Freeman v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5). Even if the sen-\ntencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, “if\nthe judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point\nto explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guide-\nlines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (stating that out-\nside the context of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, “in the normal course the\ndistrict judge’s calculation of the Guidelines range appli-\ncable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the\nterm of imprisonment imposed”). That a district court\nmay ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the\nGuidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force\nas the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that\nan incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error en-\nsures that they remain the starting point for every sen-\ntencing calculation in the federal system.\n   Similarly, appellate review for reasonableness using the\nGuidelines as a benchmark helps promote uniformity by\n“tend[ing] to iron out sentencing differences.” Booker, 543\nU. S., at 263. Courts of appeals may presume a within-\nGuidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita, 551 U. S.,\nat 347, and they may further “consider the extent of the\ndeviation” from the Guidelines as part of their reason-\nableness review, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. As in Miller, then,\nthe post-Booker sentencing regime puts in place proce-\ndural “hurdle[s]” that, in practice, make the imposition of\na non-Guidelines sentence less likely. See 482 U. S., at 435.\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a more difficult case than Miller, because there\nare relevant differences between Florida’s sentencing\nscheme and the current federal sentencing regime. The\nFlorida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sen-\ntence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the\ncourts of appeals may—but are not required to—presume\nthat a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. And\nunder Florida’s scheme, a sentencing court departing from\nthe guideline range was required to provide “clear and\nconvincing” reasons for the departure; whereas this Court\nhas not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-the-\nboard standard of review to variances. Rather, we have\nheld that a district court varying from the Federal Guide-\nlines should provide an explanation adequate to the extent\nof the departure. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 51.\n   But contrary to the arguments advanced by the Gov-\nernment and JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent (hereinafter dis-\nsent), see Brief for United States 23–24; post, at 5–6,\nthese differences are not dispositive. Although the federal\nsystem’s procedural rules establish gentler checks on\nthe sentencing court’s discretion than Florida’s did, they\nnevertheless impose a series of requirements on sentenc-\ning courts that cabin the exercise of that discretion.\nCommon sense indicates that in general, this system will\nsteer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences.\n   Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicat-\ning that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended\neffect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\nEven after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines\nadvisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases\nimposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences\nthat depart downward from the Guidelines on the Gov-\nernment’s motion. See United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion, 2011 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics,\np. 63 (Figure G) (16th ed.) (USSC).

See also Baron-Evans & Stith, Booker Rules,\n160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012). Moreover, the Sen-\ntencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guide-\nlines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move\nwith it. See USSC, Final Quarterly Data Report, FY 2012,\np. 32 (Figure C); USSC, Report on the Continuing Impact\nof United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing, Pt. A,\npp. 60–68 (2012).5\n   The federal system adopts procedural measures intended\nto make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A\nretrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable\nto a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sen-\ntence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n                             C\n  Our holding today is consistent with basic principles of\nfairness that animate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The\nFramers considered ex post facto laws to be “contrary to\nthe first principles of the social compact and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation.” The Federalist No. 44,\np. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Clause\nensures that individuals have fair warning of applicable\nlaws and guards against vindictive legislative action. See\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28–29 (1981); see also\npost, at 11–13. Even where these concerns are not directly\nimplicated, however, the Clause also safeguards “a fun-\ndamental fairness interest . . . in having the government\nabide by the rules of law it establishes to govern the cir-\n\n——————\n  5 The Government does not dispute these statistics. It argues instead\n\nthat by relying on aggregated data, Peugh glosses over the fact that\nnon-Guidelines sentences are more common for certain crimes and that\nsome individual judges are less likely to follow the Guidelines than\nothers. Brief for United States 49–50. But these arguments do not\nrefute the basic point that the applicable Guidelines channel sentences\ntoward the specified range, even if they do not fix them within it.\n14               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncumstances under which it can deprive a person of his or\nher liberty or life.” Carmell, 529 U. S., at 533.\n   The Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Gov-\nernment’s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences\nfor specific crimes. When Peugh committed his crime,\nthe recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months. When he\nwas sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months. “[T]he purpose\nand effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation]\nwas to increase the rates and length of incarceration for\n[fraud].” Miller, 482 U. S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar:\nAmendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988—\nSentencing Guidelines), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824, n. (1984) ( per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted)). Such a retrospective increase in the measure of\npunishment raises clear ex post facto concerns. We have\npreviously recognized, for instance, that a defendant\ncharged with an increased punishment for his crime is\nlikely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty. See\nCarmell, 529 U. S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U. S., at\n32. This pressure does not disappear simply because the\nGuidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware\nthat the range is intended to, and usually does, exert\ncontrolling influence on the sentence that the court will\nimpose.\n   We are therefore not persuaded by the argument ad-\nvanced by the Government and also suggested by the\ndissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto\nClause are not implicated by this case. While the Gov-\nernment argues that the Sentencing Commission is insu-\nlated from legislative interference, see Brief for United\nStates 42–44, our precedents make clear that the coverage\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative\nacts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a\nchange in a parole board’s rules could, given an adequate\nshowing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause). It is true\nthat we held, in Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708,\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

But, contrary to\nthe dissent’s view, see post, at 11–13, the Ex Post Facto\nClause does not merely protect reliance interests. It also\nreflects principles of “fundamental justice.” Carmell, 529\nU. S., at 531.6\n                              IV\n   The Government’s principal argument that there is no\nconstitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing\nGuidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the sta-\ntus of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines “ha[d] the force\nand effect of laws,” Booker, 543 U. S., at 234, the post-\nBooker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that\nstatus due to their advisory nature. The dissent echoes\nthis argument. Post, at 1–3, 6–8.\n   The distinction that the Government draws is necessar-\nily a fine one, because our precedents firmly establish that\nchanges in law need not bind a sentencing authority in\norder to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, for example,\na law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter\nthe statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.\nIn Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, this Court con-\nsidered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law\naltering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a\nrange of 0 to 15 years’ imprisonment to a mandatory term\nof 15 years’ imprisonment. Although the upper boundary\nof the sentencing court’s power to punish remained un-\nchanged, it was enough that the petitioners were “de-\nprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would\n——————\n  6 Ofcourse, “while the principle of unfairness helps explain and shape\nthe Clause’s scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force.” Carmell, 529 U. S., at\n533, n. 23.\n16               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive them freedom from custody and control prior to the\nexpiration of the 15-year term.” Id., at 402 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In addition, our cases make clear that “[t]he presence of\ndiscretion does not displace the protections of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” Garner, 529 U. S., at 253. In a series of\ncases, for example, this Court has considered the validity\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the\nterms on which discretionary parole or early release was\navailable to prisoners. See Garner, 529 U. S. 244; Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S. 499; Weaver, 450 U. S. 24. Although these\ncases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether\nthere was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did\nwe indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not\nguaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the\nparole board was fatal to his claim. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 253; Morales, 514 U. S., at 508–510, and n. 6; Weaver,\n450 U. S., at 30–31.\n   The Government does not challenge these holdings but\nrather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much\nlike guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise\nto an ex post facto violation. It contrasts the Sentenc-\ning Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller,\nwhich, the Government indicates, really did place “a sub-\nstantial legislative constraint on the judge’s exercise of\nsentencing discretion.” Brief for United States 21. But as\nwe have explained at length, the difference between the\nfederal system and the scheme the Court considered in\nMiller is one in degree, not in kind. The Florida system\ndid not achieve its “binding legal effect,” Brief for United\nStates 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in\nevery case. Rather, it achieved its “binding legal effect”\nthrough a set of procedural rules and standards for appel-\nlate review that, in combination, encouraged district\ncourts to sentence within the guidelines. See Miller, 482\nU. S., at 432–433. We have detailed all of the ways in\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are\nreviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee supra, at 5–6.\n   While the Government accurately describes several\nattributes of federal sentencing after Booker, the conclu-\nsion it draws by isolating these features of the system is\nultimately not supportable. On the Government’s account,\nthe Guidelines are just one among many persuasive\nsources a sentencing court can consult, no different from\na “policy paper.” Brief for United States 28. The Govern-\nment’s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that\ndistrict courts are not required to consult any policy paper\nin order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must\nthey “consider the extent of [their] deviation” from a given\n——————\n  7 The Government likens the Sentencing Guidelines system to the\n\nParole Commission’s Parole Release Guidelines, which established an\nadvisory framework for parole decisions, see United States Parole\nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980), and argues that Miller\nindicated that retrospectively applying more stringent parole guidelines\nwould not have constituted an ex post facto violation. The issue of\nthe constitutional validity of the retrospective application of the parole\nguidelines, however, was not before the Court in Miller. While the\nMiller Court did state that lower court cases discussing the federal\nparole guidelines were “inapposite” to its discussion of the Florida\nguidelines, 482 U. S., at 434–435, it had no occasion to address whether\nchanges to the parole guidelines generated an ex post facto problem.\n18               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy paper and “ensure that the justification is suffi-\nciently compelling to support the degree of the variance,”\nGall, 552 U. S., at 50. Courts of appeals, in turn, are not\npermitted to presume that a sentence that comports with\na particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of\nappeals, in considering whether the district court’s sen-\ntence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure\nfrom a given policy paper in determining whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion, see id., at 51. It is\nsimply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are\nmerely a volume that the district court reads with aca-\ndemic interest in the course of sentencing.\n    Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,\nnotwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a\nhigher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nsentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration\nto the current version of the Guidelines as representing\nthe most recent views of the agency charged by Congress\nwith developing sentencing policy. See post, at 8 (citing\nDemaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795). But this does not render our\nholding “purely semantic.” Id., at 795. District courts\nmust begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines\nin effect at the time of the offense and use them to calcu-\nlate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines\nwill anchor both the district court’s discretion and the\nappellate review process in all of the ways we have de-\nscribed. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the\nstatus of one of many reasons a district court might give\nfor deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is\nsimply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.\n     Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the\nEx Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an\nincreased Guidelines range would be in tension with this\nCourt’s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would “largely undo\n. . . the Booker remedy” for the Sixth Amendment violation\nfound there. Brief for United States 35. If the Guidelines\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare binding enough to trigger an ex post facto violation, the\nargument goes, then they must be binding enough to\ntrigger a Sixth Amendment violation as well. The Gov-\nernment’s argument assumes that the Sixth Amendment\nand the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary;\nthat only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher\nsentence in a manner that raises Sixth Amendment con-\ncerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determi-\nnate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But the\nSixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are\nanalytically distinct. Our Sixth Amendment cases have\nfocused on when a given finding of fact is required to make\na defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty. Our\nex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a\nchange in law creates a “significant risk” of a higher sen-\ntence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the\nnew Guidelines is substantially likely. The Booker remedy\nwas designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to\nexploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote\nsentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner,\nsee supra, at 12–13, it appears so far to be achieving this\nbalance. Nothing that we say today “undo[es]” the hold-\nings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent\nsentencing cases.\n                        *    *    *\n   The arguments put forward by the Government and the\ndissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh’s case\nfalls within Calder’s third category of ex post facto viola-\ntions. “[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [govern-\nment] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering\nthe substantive ‘formula’ used to calculate the applicable\nsentencing range.” Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is\nprecisely what the amended Guidelines did here. Doing so\n20                  PEUGH v.

Here, however, the Gov-\nernment does not argue that any ex post facto violation was harmless.\nAnd indeed, any such argument would fail in light of the fact that the\nDistrict Court rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim in keeping with\nCircuit precedent, applied the new Guidelines, and indicated at sen-\ntencing that “a sentence within the [G]uideline range is the most\nappropriate sentence in this case.” App. 30, 100.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Art. I, §9, cl. 3. The retroactive applica-\ntion of the 2009 Guidelines did not alter the punishment\naffixed to petitioner’s crime and does not violate this pro-\nscription. I would affirm the Seventh Circuit’s decision\ndenying petitioner’s ex post facto claim. Therefore, I re-\nspectfully dissent.\n                              I\n   It is well established that an ex post facto law includes\n“[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a\ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,\nwhen committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)\n(opinion of Chase, J.). Under our precedents, the relevant\ninquiry for determining whether a law “inflicts a greater\npunishment,” is whether the “retroactive application of\nthe change in [the] law created ‘a sufficient risk of increas-\ning the measure of punishment attached to the covered\ncrimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250 (2000) (quot-\ning California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.\n499, 509 (1995)). The retroactive application of subse-\nquently amended Guidelines does not create a “sufficient\nrisk” of increasing a defendant’s punishment for two rea-\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsons. First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion\nof district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a de-\nfendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended\nGuidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive\na harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guide-\nlines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guide-\nlines help district judges to impose sentences that comply\nwith §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in\nessence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sen-\ntence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological\ngoals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve\nsuch pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create\na risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. We have never held that government\naction violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it merely\ninfluences the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.\n                              A\n   The Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not constrain the\ndiscretion of district courts. As we have said repeatedly,\nthe Guidelines are “advisory.” United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220, 245 (2005) (remedial opinion for the Court\nby BREYER, J.). For this reason, district courts may not\n“presume” that a within-Guidelines sentence is appropri-\nate. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 50 (2007); see also\nNelson v. United States, 555 U. S. 350, 352 (2009) ( per\ncuriam) (the Guidelines range is “not to be presumed\nreasonable”); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 351\n(2007) (“[T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit\nof a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should\napply”). Rather, district courts must “make an individual-\nized assessment” of the appropriate sentence “based on the\nfacts presented.” Gall, supra, at 50. Moreover, a district\ncourt may freely depart from the range recommended by\nthe Guidelines based not only on “an individualized de-\ntermination that [the Guidelines] yield an excessive sen-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntence in a particular case,” but also based on “policy dis-\nagreement” with the Guidelines themselves. Spears v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. 261, 264 (2009) (per curiam); see\nPepper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 23) (“[O]ur post-Booker decisions make clear that\na district court may in appropriate cases impose a non-\nGuidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the\nCommission’s views”).\n   It is true that a district judge who “decides that an\noutside-Guidelines sentence is warranted” must “ensure\nthat the justification is sufficiently compelling to support\nthe degree of the variance” and that “a major departure\nshould be supported by a more significant justification\nthan a minor one.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50. This does not\ndemonstrate that the Guidelines constrain the judge’s dis-\ncretion, but rather comports with the notion that an ex-\nplanation is essential for “meaningful appellate review.”\nIbid. And, when a district court departs from the recom-\nmended range, the court of appeals may not presume that\nsuch a sentence is unreasonable. Id., at 47; id., at 41\n(“[C]ourts of appeals must review all sentences—whether\ninside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines\nrange—under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard”).\nWhile “[t]he applicable guideline [may] nudg[e] [the sen-\ntencing judge] toward the sentencing range,” “his freedom\nto impose a reasonable sentence outside the range is un-\nfettered.” United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795\n(CA7 2006).\n   None of petitioner’s arguments to the contrary is per-\nsuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines\nconstrain district courts’ discretion because improperly\ncalculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error.\nBrief for Petitioner 20–21, and n. 7; 18 U. S. C. §3742(f);\nCf. Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. This argument is a non sequi-\ntur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose\nif district courts consider the “range established” by the\n4                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nGuidelines, §3553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts\nmust “begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calcu-\nlating the applicable Guidelines range.” Id., at 49. But\nthe fact that courts must give due consideration to the\nrecommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does\nnot mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court’s\ndiscretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply\nmeans that district courts must consider the correct vari-\nables before exercising their discretion.\n   Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district\ncourt discretion because sentences falling outside the\nGuidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive\nunreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, how-\never, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district\njudge can justify his sentence based on agreement with\neither of two Guidelines—the old or the new. If a dis-\ntrict court calculated the sentencing range under the\nnew Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a below-\nGuidelines sentence that fell within the range provided\nby the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such\na sentence “substantively unreasonable.” To do so would\ncast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued un-\nder the old Guidelines. Similarly, it is hard to imagine\nthat a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for sub-\nstantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell\nwithin the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This\ncase provides an apt example. After considering all of\nthe §3553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines range was “the\nmost appropriate sentence in this case.” App. 100. The\nsame sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if\nthe District Court, on remand, once again determined that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropri-\nate in light of all the facts. The essential point is that once\nnew Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nreview does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of\ndistrict courts to sentence offenders within either of the\ntwo ranges.\n  The majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Flor-\nida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), supports its conclusion that\nretroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. See ante, at 9–10. But Miller leads\nto the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed\nnarrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory\nsentencing ranges for particular crimes. 482 U. S., at\n425–426. If a judge imposed a sentence within that nar-\nrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written\nexplanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and\nthe sentence was not subject to appellate review. Ibid. If\nthe judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive\nrange, however, he was required to provide “ ‘clear and\nconvincing reasons,’ ” id., at 426 (quoting Fla. Rule Crim.\nProc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based “on facts proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt,” that justified the departure, 482 U. S.,\nat 432. In concluding that retroactive application of this\nscheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned\nthat the Florida guidelines did not “simply provide flexible\n‘guideposts’ for use in the exercise of discretion: instead,\nthey create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before\ndiscretion c[ould] be exercised.” Id., at 435.\n  The Court cites Miller for the proposition “that applying\namended sentencing guidelines that increase a defend-\nant’s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts\npossess discretion to deviate from the recommended sen-\ntencing range.” Ante, at 10. But that claim is not sup-\nported by Miller. The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the\nsentencing judge’s discretion.\n  The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.\nIndeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly\n6                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that the Guidelines do not create a “high hurdle”—\nor any hurdle at all—“that must be cleared before discre-\ntion can be exercised.” Miller, 482 U. S., at 435. Rather,\nthe Guidelines are “flexible ‘guideposts’ ” which inform the\ndistrict courts’ discretion. Ibid. Accordingly, their retro-\nactive application cannot constitute a violation of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause.\n                               B\n  Notwithstanding the discretion district courts have to\nimpose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statu-\ntory range, Guidelines do “influenc[e] the sentences im-\nposed by judges.” Ante, at 12. But, the Guidelines do this\nby helping district courts impose sentences that are con-\nsistent with §3553(a). It is difficult to see how an advi-\nsory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences\nmore in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever\nconstitute an ex post facto violation. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court concludes.\n  District courts are charged with imposing sentences that\nare “ ‘sufficient, but not greater than necessary’ to comply\nwith the sentencing purposes set forth in” §3553(a). Pep-\nper, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting §3553(a)).\nThe district court’s task is to impose sentences that reflect\nthe punitive goals of justice, deterrence, protection of the\npublic, and rehabilitation. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(2). While\neasily stated, this goal is difficult to achieve. Enter the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the Sen-\ntencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect\nthe “same basic §3553(a) objectives” that district courts\nmust consider. Rita, 551 U. S., at 348; see also 28 U. S. C.\n§991(b)(1)(A). In crafting the Guidelines, the Commission\nbegan with “an empirical examination of 10,000 presen-\ntence reports setting forth what judges had done in the\npast.” Rita, supra, at 349 (citing United States Sentencing\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.1, comment., n. 3\n(Nov. 2006) (USSG)). The Commission then “modif[ied]\nand adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater\nrationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with con-\ngressional instructions, and the like.” Rita, supra, at 349.\nWhile an individual judge has limited experience upon\nwhich to draw, the Commission “has the capacity . . . to\nbase its determinations on empirical data and national\nexperience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate\nexpertise.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 109\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Com-\nmission updates the Guidelines regularly as new infor-\nmation becomes available. It consults with “prosecutors,\ndefenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associa-\ntions, experts in penology, and others,” to ensure that the\nGuidelines continue to further §3553(a)’s goals. Rita,\nsupra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U. S., at 263 (noting\nthat the Commission would “modify its Guidelines in light\nof what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be\nbetter sentencing practices”).\n   In light of this extensive study, amendments to the\nGuidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better\ncomport with the §3553(a) factors. If the Commission has\nfulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are\ngenerally consistent with §3553(a)(2), then sentences\nshould fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.\nThis, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences\nare presumed, on appeal, to reflect a “discretionary deci-\nsion” by the district court that “accords with the Commis-\nsion’s view.” Rita, supra, at 351.\n   Again, this case furnishes a ready example. Prior to pe-\ntitioner’s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission\n“to consider” whether fraud guidelines were “ ‘sufficient to\ndeter and punish’ ” particular offenses, in light of increases\nto statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes\nother than bank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason\n8                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-\nCollar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,\n§905(b)(2), 116 Stat. 805). This produced amended Guide-\nlines, which were based on the Commission’s further\nassessment of “economic crime issues over a number of\nyears.” USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment)\n(effective Nov. 1, 2001). With an amended Guidelines\nsentencing range, the District Court concluded that a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence was “the most appropriate\nsentence.” App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing\nrange nor §3553(a) changed between the time of petition-\ner’s offense and sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to\nsay that reliance on information reflected in the amended\nGuidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n   This is underscored by the fact that even the Court’s\nholding—which requires district courts to calculate the\nGuidelines range in effect at the time of the offense—will\nnot eliminate the “risk” of a higher sentence. The district\njudge remains free to consider the range produced by the\namended Guidelines. See Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795 (“A\njudge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentenc-\ning Commission”). Thus, the mere fact that new Guide-\nlines have been promulgated creates some risk of an\nincreased sentence, even if district courts are required to\ncalculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.\nPetitioner has presented no evidence indicating what\nportion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the\nretroactive application of the amended Guidelines and\nwhat portion flows from their very existence. In the ab-\nsence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory\nGuidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not,\nI would not find the “risk” of an increased sentence created\nby the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be “suf-\nficient” for ex post facto purposes.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                                 II\n    Today’s opinion also demonstrates the unworkability of\nour ex post facto jurisprudence. Under our current prece-\ndent, whenever a change in the law creates a “risk” of an\nincreased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is\n“sufficient,” see Morales, 514 U. S., at 509, or sufficiently\n“ ‘significant,’ ” see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Our analysis under that test has devolved into\nlittle more than an exercise in judicial intuition. I would\nreturn to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in\nJustice Chase’s classic Calder formulation, under which\nlaws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retro-\nactively increase the punishment “annexed to the crime.”\n3 Dall., at 390.\n                             A\n   This Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere\ndecade after the Constitution was ratified. In Calder,\nJustice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws. 3\nDall., at 390. As relevant, Justice Chase’s third category\nindicated that “[e]very law that changes the punishment,\nand inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed” violates the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Ibid. Justice Chase’s emphasis on increases\nin the punishment “annexed to the crime” was grounded\nin the English common law and accurately reflected the\noriginal understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nPart II–B, infra. Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated\nfrom this formulation. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S.\n221 (1883), the Court declared that “any law passed after\nthe commission of an offence which . . . ‘in relation to that\noffence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party\nto his disadvantage,’ is an ex post facto law.” Id., at 235\n(quoting Justice Washington’s jury charge in United States\nv.

UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndecide that Kring’s “departure from Calder’s explanation\nof the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause\nwas . . . unjustified.” Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,\n49 (1990) (overruling Kring).\n   Following Collins’ disavowal of Kring, the Court held\nthat a law is ex post facto if it “produces a sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.” Morales, supra, at 509. While Morales\navoided the over-breadth of Kring’s “disadvantage the de-\nfendant” test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto ju-\nrisprudence to the original understanding of the term.\nThe “sufficient risk” test also depends upon empirical\nanalysis that cannot yield determinative answers and\nwhich courts are ill equipped to handle. See, e.g., Gar-\nner, 529 U. S., at 255 (“When the rule does not by its\nown terms show a significant risk, the respondent must\ndemonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule’s practical\nimplementation by the agency charged with exercising\ndiscretion, that its retroactive application will result in\na longer period of incarceration than under the earlier\nrule”). More fundamentally, the “sufficient risk” test, like\nthe “disadvantage the defendant” test, wrongly focuses on\nthe particular sentence that the defendant might receive,\nrather than on the punishment “annexed to the crime.”\n   The practical difficulties with the test are apparent even\nfrom our application in Morales, where we considered an\namendment to California’s parole procedures that allowed,\nunder certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to\ndecrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.\nUnder the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to specu-\nlate about the possible effects of the new law on various\nindividuals’ prison terms. Ultimately, we held that the\namendment did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause be-\n——————\n  * As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was\nan error to which I succumbed.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncause the “narrow class of prisoners covered by the\namendment [could not] reasonably expect that their pro-\nspects for early release on parole would be enhanced by\nthe opportunity of annual hearings.” Morales, supra, at\n512. But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expecta-\ntions that prisoners and defendants have about how many\ndays they will spend in prison.\n                              B\n   “Although the Latin phrase ‘ex post facto’ literally en-\ncompasses any law passed ‘after the fact,’ ” Collins, 497\nU. S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase\n“was a term of art with an established meaning” at the\ntime of the founding. Ibid. Blackstone offers the first key\nto understanding this “established meaning.” He explic-\nitly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct crimi-\nnal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44\n(hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive citizens of\nnotice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to\nman’s “reason and freewill.” Id., at *39; see id., at *46.\nBlackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate. Id., at\n*44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (J. Madison) (“[E]x post facto laws . . . are contrary\nto the first principles of the social compact, and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation”). For this reason, ex post\nfacto laws have rightly been described as “formidable\ninstruments of tyranny,” id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton),\nand their prohibition a “bulwark in favour of the personal\nsecurity of the subject,” Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of\nChase, J.).\n   Although Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post\nfacto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent\nacts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were also under-\nstood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding. See,\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ne.g., 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of\nEngland, as treated in a Course of Vinerian Lectures 638\n(1792) (discussing “acts of parliament, which principally\naffect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or\ncreating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the\nordinary course of law”); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States §679, p. 486 (Abr. 1833)\n(The “prohibition” against ex post facto laws “reaches every\nlaw . . . whereby the act, if a crime, is aggravated in enor-\nmity, or punishment”). Justice Chase’s formulation re-\nflects this understanding. Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (“Every\nlaw that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater\npunishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\ncommitted” is ex post facto). Under this view, courts must\ncompare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time\nof the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of\nsentencing. If the latter is harsher than the former, the\ncourt must apply the punishment in effect at the time of\nthe offense.\n   At common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law\nretroactively increased the punishment, because the crim-\ninal law generally “prescribed a particular sentence for\neach offense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury\non the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987). In a world of determinate sentencing, a retro-\nactive increase in the punishment affixed to a crime rend-\ners an act “punishable in a manner in which it was not\npunishable when it was committed,” Fletcher v. Peck, 6\nCranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post\nfacto violation. The key point is that “the ex post facto\n[C]lause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed\nby a statute, rather than to the sentence actually im-\nposed.” Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.

Because\nincreasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives\npeople of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of\nthe law, “[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems\nto come within the same mischief as the creation of a\ncrime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed to-\ngether.” Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).\n   Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a de-\nfendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not\nimplicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual\ncontemplating the commission of a given offense knows he\nmay be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed\nrange. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he\nmay even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But\nhe does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U.

Argued February 26, 2013—Decided June 10, 2013\nPetitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct\n  that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing, he argued that the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\n  version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of\n  his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time\n  of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh’s sentencing range\n  was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe\n  consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The\n  District Court rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and sentenced him\n  to 70 months’ imprisonment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n675 F. 3d 736, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part III–C, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when\n  a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he\n  committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher\n  sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\n  Pp. 4–13, 15–20.\n    (a) Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 543\n  U. S. 220, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing\n  procedures. A district court must begin “by correctly calculating the\n  applicable Guidelines range,” Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49,\n  and then consider the parties’ arguments and factors specified in 18\n  U. S. C. §3553(a). 552 U. S., at 49–50. The court “may not presume\n  that the Guidelines range is reasonable,” id., at 50, and must explain\n  the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid. On appeal, a sentence is\n  reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n2                      PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 51. A district court is to apply the Guidelines “in effect on the\n    date the defendant is sentenced,” §3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the\n    Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense\n    was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date\n    be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 4–7.\n       (b) The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a cat-\n    egory including, as relevant here, “[e]very law that changes the pun-\n    ishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to\n    the crime, when committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. The\n    “scope of this Latin phrase” is given “substance by an accretion of\n    case law.” Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292. The touchstone of\n    the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient\n    risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\n    crimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250. Pp. 7–8.\n       (c) The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.\n    423. There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the peti-\n    tioner was sentenced under Florida’s new sentencing guidelines,\n    which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place\n    at the time of his crime. The pre-existing guidelines would have re-\n    quired the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons\n    in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been re-\n    viewable on appeal. But under the new guidelines, a sentence within\n    the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.\n    Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the\n    ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sen-\n    tence. Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a\n    significant risk of a higher sentence.\n       The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing\n    scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentenc-\n    ing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines. Normally, a “judge will\n    use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and\n    impose a sentence within the range.” Freeman v. United States, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. That the court may impose a sentence outside that\n    range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for\n    sentencing. Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for rea-\n    sonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark. Appellate courts\n    may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v.\n    United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347, and may “consider the extent of the\n    deviation” from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness re-\n    view, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The sentencing regime also puts in place\n    procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-\n    Guidelines sentence less likely. Florida’s scheme and the federal re-\n    gime differ, but those differences are not dispositive. Common sense\n    indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evi-\n  dence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect. A retrospective\n  increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient\n  risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n  Pp. 9–13.\n     (d) The Government’s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Its\n  principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal\n  effect to attain the status of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex\n  Post Facto Clause. Changes in law need not bind a sentencing au-\n  thority for there to be an ex post facto violation, and “[t]he presence of\n  discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.” Garner,\n  529 U. S., at 253. As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines\n  and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two sys-\n  tems is one in degree, not in kind. The attributes of post-Booker sen-\n  tencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many per-\n  suasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.\n  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-\n  Booker Sixth Amendment cases. The Court’s Sixth Amendment cases,\n  which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a de-\n  fendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its\n  ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a\n  “significant risk” of a higher sentence. The Booker remedy was de-\n  signed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this\n  distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth\n  Amendment violation. Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of\n  such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall. Pp. 15–19.\n\n   SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nIII–C.

The U. S.\nSentencing Guidelines set forth an advisory sentencing\nrange for each defendant convicted in federal court. We\nconsider here whether there is an ex post facto violation\nwhen a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promul-\ngated after he committed his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing\nrange than the version in place at the time of the offense.\nWe hold that there is.\n                             I\n  Petitioner Marvin Peugh and his cousin, Steven Holle-\nwell, ran two farming-related businesses in Illinois. Grain-\nery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc.,\nprovided farming services to landowners and tenants.\n——————\n *JUSTICE KENNEDY joins this opinion except as to Part III–C.\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWhen the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow prob-\nlems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent\nschemes. First, they obtained a series of bank loans by\nrepresenting falsely the existence of contracts for future\ngrain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery. When\nthey failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the\nbank suffered losses of over $2 million. Second, they ar-\ntificially inflated the balances of accounts under their con-\ntrol by “check kiting,” or writing bad checks between their\naccounts. This scheme allowed them to overdraw an\naccount by $471,000. They engaged in their illicit conduct\nin 1999 and 2000.\n   When their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell\nwere charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation\nof 18 U. S. C. §1344. While Hollewell pleaded guilty to\none count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and\nwent to trial, where he testified that he had not intended\nto defraud the banks. The jury found him guilty of five\ncounts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining\ncounts.\n   At sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto\nClause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\nversion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at\nthe time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 ver-\nsion in effect at the time of sentencing. The two versions\nyielded significantly different results for Peugh’s applica-\nble Guidelines sentencing range. Under the 1998 Guide-\nlines, Peugh’s base offense level was 6. United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §2F1.1 (Nov.\n1998) (USSG). Thirteen levels were added for a loss\namount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruc-\ntion of justice because of Peugh’s perjury at trial, see\nUSSG §3C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under\nthe 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19. As a first-time\noffender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and\nso his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto 37 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).\n  The 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sen-\ntenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to\nhis acts. First, the base offense level was raised from 6\nto 7 for crimes, like Peugh’s, that have a statutory maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. See USSG\n§2B1.1 (Nov. 2009); 18 U. S. C. §1344. Second, the en-\nhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a\n5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines. USSG 2B1.1\n(Nov. 2009). After adding the 2-level enhancement for\nobstruction of justice, Peugh’s total offense level under the\n2009 Guidelines was 27. With a Criminal History Cate-\ngory of I, Peugh’s sentencing range rose under the 2009\nGuidelines to 70 to 87 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.\n2009). The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33\nmonths higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines\nrange.\n  At the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected\nPeugh’s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines vio-\nlated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was fore-\nclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent. App. 30 (discussing\nUnited States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791 (2006)). The\nDistrict Court declined to give Peugh a downward vari-\nance, concluding that “a sentence within the [G]uideline[s]\nrange is the most appropriate sentence in this case,” App.\n100. It sentenced Peugh to 70 months’ imprisonment,\nibid., the bottom of the 2009 Guidelines range.\n  The Seventh Circuit, in keeping with its decision in\nDemaree, rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim and affirmed\nhis conviction and sentence. 675 F. 3d 736 (2012). We\ngranted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the Ex Post Facto Clause may be\nviolated when a defendant is sentenced under the version\nof the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sen-\ntencing rather than the version in effect at the time the\ncrime was committed, and the newer Guidelines yield a\n4                   PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhigher applicable sentencing range.1 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nWe now reverse.\n                             II\n  Prior to 1984, the broad discretion of sentencing courts\nand parole officers had led to significant sentencing dis-\nparities among similarly situated offenders. To address\nthis problem, Congress created the United States Sentenc-\ning Commission. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n362, 366–367 (1989). The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n98 Stat. 1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and\ndirected the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uni-\nform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at\nsentencing. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. The Commission\nproduced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a sys-\ntem under which a set of inputs specific to a given case\n(the particular characteristics of the offense and offender)\nyielded a predetermined output (a range of months within\nwhich the defendant could be sentenced).\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 244 (2005),\nhowever, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran\nafoul of the Sixth Amendment by allowing judges to find\nfacts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond “the\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict.” See also Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The appropriate remedy for\nthis violation, the Court determined, was to strike those\nportions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory. Booker, 543 U.

See id., at 259–260, 264;\n18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(4)(A). But the Guidelines are no\nlonger binding, and the district court must consider all of\nthe factors set forth in §3553(a) to guide its discretion at\nsentencing, see Booker, 543 U. S., at 259–260, 264. The\nBooker remedy, “while not the system Congress enacted,”\nwas designed to “continue to move sentencing in Congress’\npreferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing\ndisparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to indi-\nvidualize sentences where necessary.” Id., at 264–265.\n   Our subsequent decisions have clarified the role that\nthe Guidelines play in sentencing procedures, both at the\ndistrict court level and when sentences are reviewed on\nappeal. First, “a district court should begin all sentencing\nproceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guide-\nlines range. As a matter of administration and to secure\nnationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the\nstarting point and the initial benchmark.” Gall v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted). The\ndistrict court must then consider the arguments of the par-\nties and the factors set forth in §3553(a). Id., at 49–50.\nThe district court “may not presume that the Guidelines\nrange is reasonable,” id., at 50; and it “may in appropriate\ncases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on dis-\nagreement with the [Sentencing] Commission’s views,” Pep-\nper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 23) (citing Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,\n109–110 (2007)). The district court must explain the basis\nfor its chosen sentence on the record. Gall, 552 U. S., at\n50. “[A] major departure [from the Guidelines] should be\nsupported by a more significant justification than a minor\none.” Ibid.\n   On appeal, the district court’s sentence is reviewed for\nreasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee id., at 51; Booker, 543 U. S., at 261–264. Failure to\ncalculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes proce-\n6                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndural error, as does treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\nGall, 552 U. S., at 51. The court of appeals may, but is\nnot required to, presume that a within-Guidelines sentence\nis reasonable. Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347\n(2007). The reviewing court may not apply a heightened\nstandard of review or a presumption of unreasonableness\nto sentences outside the Guidelines range, although it\n“will, of course, take into account the totality of the cir-\ncumstances, including the extent of any variance from the\nGuidelines range.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 49–51. We have in-\ndicated that “a district court’s decision to vary from the\nadvisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when” it\nis based on the particular facts of a case. Kimbrough, 552\nU. S., at 109.2 Overall, this system “requires a court to\ngive respectful consideration to the Guidelines,” but it\n“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other\nstatutory concerns as well.” Id., at 101 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Under 18 U.

Whether the Ex Post Facto Clause was vio-\nlated by the use of the more onerous Guidelines in effect\non the date of Peugh’s sentencing is the question pre-\nsented here.\n                            III\n                             A\n   The Constitution prohibits both federal and state gov-\nernments from enacting any “ex post facto Law.” Art. I, §9,\ncl. 3; Art. I, §10. The phrase “ ‘ex post facto law’ was a\nterm of art with an established meaning at the time of the\nframing.” Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 41 (1990).\nIn Calder v. Bull, Justice Chase reviewed the definition\nthat the term had acquired in English common law:\n    “1st. Every law that makes an action done before the\n    passing of the law, and which was innocent when\n    done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every\n    law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than\n    it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes\n    the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment,\n    than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.\n    4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence,\n    and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law\n    required at the time of the commission of the offence,\n    in order to convict the offender.” 3 Dall., at 390 (em-\n    phasis deleted).\nSee also Carmell v. Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 521–525 (2000)\n(discussing Calder v. Bull and the common-law under-\nstanding of the term). Building on Justice Chase’s formu-\nlation of what constitutes an “ex post facto Law,” our cases\n“have not attempted to precisely delimit the scope of this\nLatin phrase, but have instead given it substance by an\naccretion of case law.” Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282,\n292 (1977).\n  At issue here is Calder’s third category of ex post facto\n8                    PEUGH v.

Peugh’s claim is that\nthe Clause was violated because the 2009 Guidelines call\nfor a greater punishment than attached to bank fraud in\n2000, when his crimes were completed. The Government\ncounters that because the more punitive Guidelines ap-\nplied at Peugh’s sentencing were only advisory, there was\nno ex post facto problem.\n   Each of the parties can point to prior decisions of this\nCourt that lend support to its view. On the one hand, we\nhave never accepted the proposition that a law must in-\ncrease the maximum sentence for which a defendant is\neligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See,\ne.g., Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937). More-\nover, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some\nmeasure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto\nclaim. See Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 253 (2000). On\nthe other hand, we have made it clear that mere specula-\ntion or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively\nincrease the punishment for a crime will not suffice to\nestablish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nCalifornia Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,\n509 (1995). The touchstone of this Court’s inquiry is\nwhether a given change in law presents a “ ‘sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.’ ” Garner, 529 U. S., at 250 (quoting Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S., at 509). The question when a change in\nlaw creates such a risk is “a matter of degree”; the test\ncannot be reduced to a “single formula.” Id., at 509 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE THOMAS, raising the issue on his own initiative, would reject\n\nour established Ex Post Facto Clause framework.

Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), in which this\nCourt considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing\nguidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.\nUnder Florida’s system, a calculation under the guidelines\nyielded a presumptive sentencing range. Id., at 426. This\nrange was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing\njudge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range\n“ ‘without the requirement of a written explanation.’ ”\nIbid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)).\nIf the court wished to depart from the guidelines range,\nhowever, it was required to give “clear and convincing\nreasons in writing for doing so.” 482 U. S., at 426. A\nwithin-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a non-\nguidelines sentence was subject to appellate review. Ibid.\n   The petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new\nguidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than\nthe guidelines that had been in place at the time of his\ncrime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new\nrange. Ibid. This Court found an ex post facto violation.\nWe emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner’s\nsentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentenc-\ning judge would have been required to provide clear and\nconvincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the\nsentence would then have been reviewable on appeal. Id.,\nat 432. In contrast, because the sentence imposed was\nwithin the new guidelines range, it required no explana-\ntion and was unreviewable. Id., at 432–433. The fact that\nFlorida’s guidelines “create[d] a high hurdle that must be\ncleared before discretion can be exercised” was sufficient\nto render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law. Id.,\nat 435.\n   Miller thus establishes that applying amended sentenc-\ning guidelines that increase a defendant’s recommended\n10                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwith-\nstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion\nto deviate from the recommended sentencing range. The\nsentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sen-\ntences for similarly situated offenders into a specified\nrange. Its reason-giving requirements and standards of\nappellate review meant that while variation was possible,\nit was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defend-\nant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Under the\nFlorida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines\nrange applicable to an offender created a significant risk\nthat he would receive a higher sentence.4 The same prin-\nciples apply here.\n   The post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to\nachieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions\nare anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a\nmeaningful benchmark through the process of appellate\nreview. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107. As we have\ndescribed, “district courts must begin their analysis with\nthe Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout\nthe sentencing process.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50, n. 6 (em-\nphasis added). Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines\nrange constitutes procedural error. Id., at 51. A district\ncourt contemplating a non-Guidelines sentence “must con-\nsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\njustification is sufficiently compelling to support the de-\ngree of the variance.” Id., at 50.

S., at ___ (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment) (slip op., at 1) (“[T]he law permits the\n——————\n  4 Miller employed a “substantial disadvantage” test that this Court\n\nhas since abandoned. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,\n514 U. S. 499, 506–507, n. 3 (1995). The relevant question is whether\nthe change in law creates a “ ‘sufficient’ ” or “significant” risk of increas-\ning the punishment for a given crime. Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244,\n250, 251 (2000). As we have made clear, however, the result in Miller\nremains sound. See Morales, 514 U. S., at 506–507, n. 3.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

S., at\n261–262)).\n   These requirements mean that “[i]n the usual sentenc-\ning, . . . the judge will use the Guidelines range as the\nstarting point in the analysis and impose a sentence within\nthe range.” Freeman v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5). Even if the sen-\ntencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, “if\nthe judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point\nto explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guide-\nlines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.” Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (stating that out-\nside the context of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, “in the normal course the\ndistrict judge’s calculation of the Guidelines range appli-\ncable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the\nterm of imprisonment imposed”). That a district court\nmay ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the\nGuidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force\nas the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that\nan incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error en-\nsures that they remain the starting point for every sen-\ntencing calculation in the federal system.\n   Similarly, appellate review for reasonableness using the\nGuidelines as a benchmark helps promote uniformity by\n“tend[ing] to iron out sentencing differences.” Booker, 543\nU. S., at 263. Courts of appeals may presume a within-\nGuidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita, 551 U. S.,\nat 347, and they may further “consider the extent of the\ndeviation” from the Guidelines as part of their reason-\nableness review, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. As in Miller, then,\nthe post-Booker sentencing regime puts in place proce-\ndural “hurdle[s]” that, in practice, make the imposition of\na non-Guidelines sentence less likely. See 482 U. S., at 435.\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a more difficult case than Miller, because there\nare relevant differences between Florida’s sentencing\nscheme and the current federal sentencing regime. The\nFlorida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sen-\ntence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the\ncourts of appeals may—but are not required to—presume\nthat a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. And\nunder Florida’s scheme, a sentencing court departing from\nthe guideline range was required to provide “clear and\nconvincing” reasons for the departure; whereas this Court\nhas not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-the-\nboard standard of review to variances. Rather, we have\nheld that a district court varying from the Federal Guide-\nlines should provide an explanation adequate to the extent\nof the departure. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 51.\n   But contrary to the arguments advanced by the Gov-\nernment and JUSTICE THOMAS’ dissent (hereinafter dis-\nsent), see Brief for United States 23–24; post, at 5–6,\nthese differences are not dispositive. Although the federal\nsystem’s procedural rules establish gentler checks on\nthe sentencing court’s discretion than Florida’s did, they\nnevertheless impose a series of requirements on sentenc-\ning courts that cabin the exercise of that discretion.\nCommon sense indicates that in general, this system will\nsteer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences.\n   Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicat-\ning that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended\neffect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\nEven after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines\nadvisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases\nimposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences\nthat depart downward from the Guidelines on the Gov-\nernment’s motion. See United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion, 2011 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics,\np. 63 (Figure G) (16th ed.) (USSC).

See also Baron-Evans & Stith, Booker Rules,\n160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012). Moreover, the Sen-\ntencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guide-\nlines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move\nwith it. See USSC, Final Quarterly Data Report, FY 2012,\np. 32 (Figure C); USSC, Report on the Continuing Impact\nof United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing, Pt. A,\npp. 60–68 (2012).5\n   The federal system adopts procedural measures intended\nto make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A\nretrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable\nto a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sen-\ntence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n                             C\n  Our holding today is consistent with basic principles of\nfairness that animate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The\nFramers considered ex post facto laws to be “contrary to\nthe first principles of the social compact and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation.” The Federalist No. 44,\np. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Clause\nensures that individuals have fair warning of applicable\nlaws and guards against vindictive legislative action. See\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28–29 (1981); see also\npost, at 11–13. Even where these concerns are not directly\nimplicated, however, the Clause also safeguards “a fun-\ndamental fairness interest . . . in having the government\nabide by the rules of law it establishes to govern the cir-\n\n——————\n  5 The Government does not dispute these statistics. It argues instead\n\nthat by relying on aggregated data, Peugh glosses over the fact that\nnon-Guidelines sentences are more common for certain crimes and that\nsome individual judges are less likely to follow the Guidelines than\nothers. Brief for United States 49–50. But these arguments do not\nrefute the basic point that the applicable Guidelines channel sentences\ntoward the specified range, even if they do not fix them within it.\n14               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncumstances under which it can deprive a person of his or\nher liberty or life.” Carmell, 529 U. S., at 533.\n   The Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Gov-\nernment’s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences\nfor specific crimes. When Peugh committed his crime,\nthe recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months. When he\nwas sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months. “[T]he purpose\nand effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation]\nwas to increase the rates and length of incarceration for\n[fraud].” Miller, 482 U. S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar:\nAmendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988—\nSentencing Guidelines), 451 So. 2d 824, 824, n. (1984) ( per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted)). Such a retrospective increase in the measure of\npunishment raises clear ex post facto concerns. We have\npreviously recognized, for instance, that a defendant\ncharged with an increased punishment for his crime is\nlikely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty. See\nCarmell, 529 U. S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U. S., at\n32. This pressure does not disappear simply because the\nGuidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware\nthat the range is intended to, and usually does, exert\ncontrolling influence on the sentence that the court will\nimpose.\n   We are therefore not persuaded by the argument ad-\nvanced by the Government and also suggested by the\ndissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto\nClause are not implicated by this case. While the Gov-\nernment argues that the Sentencing Commission is insu-\nlated from legislative interference, see Brief for United\nStates 42–44, our precedents make clear that the coverage\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative\nacts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a\nchange in a parole board’s rules could, given an adequate\nshowing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause). It is true\nthat we held, in Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708,\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

But, contrary to\nthe dissent’s view, see post, at 11–13, the Ex Post Facto\nClause does not merely protect reliance interests. It also\nreflects principles of “fundamental justice.” Carmell, 529\nU. S., at 531.6\n                              IV\n   The Government’s principal argument that there is no\nconstitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing\nGuidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the sta-\ntus of a “law” within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines “ha[d] the force\nand effect of laws,” Booker, 543 U. S., at 234, the post-\nBooker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that\nstatus due to their advisory nature. The dissent echoes\nthis argument. Post, at 1–3, 6–8.\n   The distinction that the Government draws is necessar-\nily a fine one, because our precedents firmly establish that\nchanges in law need not bind a sentencing authority in\norder to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, for example,\na law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter\nthe statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.\nIn Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, this Court con-\nsidered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law\naltering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a\nrange of 0 to 15 years’ imprisonment to a mandatory term\nof 15 years’ imprisonment. Although the upper boundary\nof the sentencing court’s power to punish remained un-\nchanged, it was enough that the petitioners were “de-\nprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would\n——————\n  6 Ofcourse, “while the principle of unfairness helps explain and shape\nthe Clause’s scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force.” Carmell, 529 U. S., at\n533, n. 23.\n16               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive them freedom from custody and control prior to the\nexpiration of the 15-year term.” Id., at 402 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In addition, our cases make clear that “[t]he presence of\ndiscretion does not displace the protections of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.” Garner, 529 U. S., at 253. In a series of\ncases, for example, this Court has considered the validity\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the\nterms on which discretionary parole or early release was\navailable to prisoners. See Garner, 529 U. S. 244; Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S. 499; Weaver, 450 U. S. 24. Although these\ncases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether\nthere was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did\nwe indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not\nguaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the\nparole board was fatal to his claim. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 253; Morales, 514 U. S., at 508–510, and n. 6; Weaver,\n450 U. S., at 30–31.\n   The Government does not challenge these holdings but\nrather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much\nlike guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise\nto an ex post facto violation. It contrasts the Sentenc-\ning Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller,\nwhich, the Government indicates, really did place “a sub-\nstantial legislative constraint on the judge’s exercise of\nsentencing discretion.” Brief for United States 21. But as\nwe have explained at length, the difference between the\nfederal system and the scheme the Court considered in\nMiller is one in degree, not in kind. The Florida system\ndid not achieve its “binding legal effect,” Brief for United\nStates 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in\nevery case. Rather, it achieved its “binding legal effect”\nthrough a set of procedural rules and standards for appel-\nlate review that, in combination, encouraged district\ncourts to sentence within the guidelines. See Miller, 482\nU. S., at 432–433. We have detailed all of the ways in\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are\nreviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee supra, at 5–6.\n   While the Government accurately describes several\nattributes of federal sentencing after Booker, the conclu-\nsion it draws by isolating these features of the system is\nultimately not supportable. On the Government’s account,\nthe Guidelines are just one among many persuasive\nsources a sentencing court can consult, no different from\na “policy paper.” Brief for United States 28. The Govern-\nment’s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that\ndistrict courts are not required to consult any policy paper\nin order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must\nthey “consider the extent of [their] deviation” from a given\n——————\n  7 The Government likens the Sentencing Guidelines system to the\n\nParole Commission’s Parole Release Guidelines, which established an\nadvisory framework for parole decisions, see United States Parole\nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980), and argues that Miller\nindicated that retrospectively applying more stringent parole guidelines\nwould not have constituted an ex post facto violation. The issue of\nthe constitutional validity of the retrospective application of the parole\nguidelines, however, was not before the Court in Miller. While the\nMiller Court did state that lower court cases discussing the federal\nparole guidelines were “inapposite” to its discussion of the Florida\nguidelines, 482 U. S., at 434–435, it had no occasion to address whether\nchanges to the parole guidelines generated an ex post facto problem.\n18               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy paper and “ensure that the justification is suffi-\nciently compelling to support the degree of the variance,”\nGall, 552 U. S., at 50. Courts of appeals, in turn, are not\npermitted to presume that a sentence that comports with\na particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of\nappeals, in considering whether the district court’s sen-\ntence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure\nfrom a given policy paper in determining whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion, see id., at 51. It is\nsimply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are\nmerely a volume that the district court reads with aca-\ndemic interest in the course of sentencing.\n    Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,\nnotwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a\nhigher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nsentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration\nto the current version of the Guidelines as representing\nthe most recent views of the agency charged by Congress\nwith developing sentencing policy. See post, at 8 (citing\nDemaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795). But this does not render our\nholding “purely semantic.” Id., at 795. District courts\nmust begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines\nin effect at the time of the offense and use them to calcu-\nlate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines\nwill anchor both the district court’s discretion and the\nappellate review process in all of the ways we have de-\nscribed. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the\nstatus of one of many reasons a district court might give\nfor deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is\nsimply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.\n     Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the\nEx Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an\nincreased Guidelines range would be in tension with this\nCourt’s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would “largely undo\n. . . the Booker remedy” for the Sixth Amendment violation\nfound there.

S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare binding enough to trigger an ex post facto violation, the\nargument goes, then they must be binding enough to\ntrigger a Sixth Amendment violation as well. The Gov-\nernment’s argument assumes that the Sixth Amendment\nand the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary;\nthat only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher\nsentence in a manner that raises Sixth Amendment con-\ncerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determi-\nnate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But the\nSixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are\nanalytically distinct. Our Sixth Amendment cases have\nfocused on when a given finding of fact is required to make\na defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty. Our\nex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a\nchange in law creates a “significant risk” of a higher sen-\ntence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the\nnew Guidelines is substantially likely. The Booker remedy\nwas designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to\nexploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote\nsentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner,\nsee supra, at 12–13, it appears so far to be achieving this\nbalance. Nothing that we say today “undo[es]” the hold-\nings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent\nsentencing cases.\n                        *    *    *\n   The arguments put forward by the Government and the\ndissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh’s case\nfalls within Calder’s third category of ex post facto viola-\ntions. “[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [govern-\nment] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering\nthe substantive ‘formula’ used to calculate the applicable\nsentencing range.” Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is\nprecisely what the amended Guidelines did here. Doing so\n20                  PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ncreated a “significant risk” of a higher sentence for Peugh,\nGarner, 529 U. S., at 251, and offended “one of the princi-\npal interests that the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed\nto serve, fundamental justice,” Carmell, 529 U. S., at 531.8\nFor these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Seventh\nCircuit and remand the case for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n——————\n  8 There may be cases in which the record makes clear that the Dis-\ntrict Court would have imposed the same sentence under the older,\nmore lenient Guidelines that it imposed under the newer, more puni-\ntive ones. In such a case, the ex post facto error may be harmless. See\nChapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967). Here, however, the Gov-\nernment does not argue that any ex post facto violation was harmless.\nAnd indeed, any such argument would fail in light of the fact that the\nDistrict Court rejected Peugh’s ex post facto claim in keeping with\nCircuit precedent, applied the new Guidelines, and indicated at sen-\ntencing that “a sentence within the [G]uideline range is the most\nappropriate sentence in this case.” App. 30, 100.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Art. I, §9, cl. 3. The retroactive applica-\ntion of the 2009 Guidelines did not alter the punishment\naffixed to petitioner’s crime and does not violate this pro-\nscription. I would affirm the Seventh Circuit’s decision\ndenying petitioner’s ex post facto claim. Therefore, I re-\nspectfully dissent.\n                              I\n   It is well established that an ex post facto law includes\n“[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a\ngreater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime,\nwhen committed.” Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)\n(opinion of Chase, J.). Under our precedents, the relevant\ninquiry for determining whether a law “inflicts a greater\npunishment,” is whether the “retroactive application of\nthe change in [the] law created ‘a sufficient risk of increas-\ning the measure of punishment attached to the covered\ncrimes.’ ” Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250 (2000) (quot-\ning California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.\n499, 509 (1995)). The retroactive application of subse-\nquently amended Guidelines does not create a “sufficient\nrisk” of increasing a defendant’s punishment for two rea-\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsons. First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion\nof district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a de-\nfendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended\nGuidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive\na harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guide-\nlines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guide-\nlines help district judges to impose sentences that comply\nwith §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in\nessence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sen-\ntence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological\ngoals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve\nsuch pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create\na risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. We have never held that government\naction violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it merely\ninfluences the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion.\n                              A\n   The Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not constrain the\ndiscretion of district courts. As we have said repeatedly,\nthe Guidelines are “advisory.” United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220, 245 (2005) (remedial opinion for the Court\nby BREYER, J.). For this reason, district courts may not\n“presume” that a within-Guidelines sentence is appropri-\nate. Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 50 (2007); see also\nNelson v. United States, 555 U. S. 350, 352 (2009) ( per\ncuriam) (the Guidelines range is “not to be presumed\nreasonable”); Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 351\n(2007) (“[T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit\nof a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should\napply”). Rather, district courts must “make an individual-\nized assessment” of the appropriate sentence “based on the\nfacts presented.” Gall, supra, at 50. Moreover, a district\ncourt may freely depart from the range recommended by\nthe Guidelines based not only on “an individualized de-\ntermination that [the Guidelines] yield an excessive sen-\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ntence in a particular case,” but also based on “policy dis-\nagreement” with the Guidelines themselves. Spears v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. 261, 264 (2009) (per curiam); see\nPepper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 23) (“[O]ur post-Booker decisions make clear that\na district court may in appropriate cases impose a non-\nGuidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the\nCommission’s views”).\n   It is true that a district judge who “decides that an\noutside-Guidelines sentence is warranted” must “ensure\nthat the justification is sufficiently compelling to support\nthe degree of the variance” and that “a major departure\nshould be supported by a more significant justification\nthan a minor one.” Gall, 552 U. S., at 50. This does not\ndemonstrate that the Guidelines constrain the judge’s dis-\ncretion, but rather comports with the notion that an ex-\nplanation is essential for “meaningful appellate review.”\nIbid. And, when a district court departs from the recom-\nmended range, the court of appeals may not presume that\nsuch a sentence is unreasonable. Id., at 47; id., at 41\n(“[C]ourts of appeals must review all sentences—whether\ninside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines\nrange—under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard”).\nWhile “[t]he applicable guideline [may] nudg[e] [the sen-\ntencing judge] toward the sentencing range,” “his freedom\nto impose a reasonable sentence outside the range is un-\nfettered.” United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795\n(CA7 2006).\n   None of petitioner’s arguments to the contrary is per-\nsuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines\nconstrain district courts’ discretion because improperly\ncalculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error.\nBrief for Petitioner 20–21, and n. 7; 18 U. S. C. §3742(f);\nCf. Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. This argument is a non sequi-\ntur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose\nif district courts consider the “range established” by the\n4                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nGuidelines, §3553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts\nmust “begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calcu-\nlating the applicable Guidelines range.” Id., at 49. But\nthe fact that courts must give due consideration to the\nrecommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does\nnot mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court’s\ndiscretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply\nmeans that district courts must consider the correct vari-\nables before exercising their discretion.\n   Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district\ncourt discretion because sentences falling outside the\nGuidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive\nunreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, how-\never, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district\njudge can justify his sentence based on agreement with\neither of two Guidelines—the old or the new. If a dis-\ntrict court calculated the sentencing range under the\nnew Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a below-\nGuidelines sentence that fell within the range provided\nby the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such\na sentence “substantively unreasonable.” To do so would\ncast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued un-\nder the old Guidelines. Similarly, it is hard to imagine\nthat a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for sub-\nstantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell\nwithin the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This\ncase provides an apt example. After considering all of\nthe §3553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines range was “the\nmost appropriate sentence in this case.” App. 100. The\nsame sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if\nthe District Court, on remand, once again determined that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropri-\nate in light of all the facts. The essential point is that once\nnew Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nreview does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of\ndistrict courts to sentence offenders within either of the\ntwo ranges.\n  The majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Flor-\nida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), supports its conclusion that\nretroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. See ante, at 9–10. But Miller leads\nto the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed\nnarrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory\nsentencing ranges for particular crimes. 482 U. S., at\n425–426. If a judge imposed a sentence within that nar-\nrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written\nexplanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and\nthe sentence was not subject to appellate review. Ibid. If\nthe judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive\nrange, however, he was required to provide “ ‘clear and\nconvincing reasons,’ ” id., at 426 (quoting Fla. Rule Crim.\nProc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based “on facts proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt,” that justified the departure, 482 U. S.,\nat 432. In concluding that retroactive application of this\nscheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned\nthat the Florida guidelines did not “simply provide flexible\n‘guideposts’ for use in the exercise of discretion: instead,\nthey create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before\ndiscretion c[ould] be exercised.” Id., at 435.\n  The Court cites Miller for the proposition “that applying\namended sentencing guidelines that increase a defend-\nant’s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts\npossess discretion to deviate from the recommended sen-\ntencing range.” Ante, at 10. But that claim is not sup-\nported by Miller. The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the\nsentencing judge’s discretion.\n  The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.\nIndeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly\n6                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that the Guidelines do not create a “high hurdle”—\nor any hurdle at all—“that must be cleared before discre-\ntion can be exercised.” Miller, 482 U. S., at 435. Rather,\nthe Guidelines are “flexible ‘guideposts’ ” which inform the\ndistrict courts’ discretion. Ibid. Accordingly, their retro-\nactive application cannot constitute a violation of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause.\n                               B\n  Notwithstanding the discretion district courts have to\nimpose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statu-\ntory range, Guidelines do “influenc[e] the sentences im-\nposed by judges.” Ante, at 12. But, the Guidelines do this\nby helping district courts impose sentences that are con-\nsistent with §3553(a). It is difficult to see how an advi-\nsory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences\nmore in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever\nconstitute an ex post facto violation. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court concludes.\n  District courts are charged with imposing sentences that\nare “ ‘sufficient, but not greater than necessary’ to comply\nwith the sentencing purposes set forth in” §3553(a). Pep-\nper, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting §3553(a)).\nThe district court’s task is to impose sentences that reflect\nthe punitive goals of justice, deterrence, protection of the\npublic, and rehabilitation. 18 U. S. C. §3553(a)(2). While\neasily stated, this goal is difficult to achieve. Enter the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the Sen-\ntencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect\nthe “same basic §3553(a) objectives” that district courts\nmust consider. Rita, 551 U. S., at 348; see also 28 U. S. C.\n§991(b)(1)(A). In crafting the Guidelines, the Commission\nbegan with “an empirical examination of 10,000 presen-\ntence reports setting forth what judges had done in the\npast.” Rita, supra, at 349 (citing United States Sentencing\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §1A1.1, comment., n. 3\n(Nov. 2006) (USSG)). The Commission then “modif[ied]\nand adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater\nrationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with con-\ngressional instructions, and the like.” Rita, supra, at 349.\nWhile an individual judge has limited experience upon\nwhich to draw, the Commission “has the capacity . . . to\nbase its determinations on empirical data and national\nexperience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate\nexpertise.” Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 109\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Com-\nmission updates the Guidelines regularly as new infor-\nmation becomes available. It consults with “prosecutors,\ndefenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associa-\ntions, experts in penology, and others,” to ensure that the\nGuidelines continue to further §3553(a)’s goals. Rita,\nsupra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U. S., at 263 (noting\nthat the Commission would “modify its Guidelines in light\nof what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be\nbetter sentencing practices”).\n   In light of this extensive study, amendments to the\nGuidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better\ncomport with the §3553(a) factors. If the Commission has\nfulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are\ngenerally consistent with §3553(a)(2), then sentences\nshould fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.\nThis, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences\nare presumed, on appeal, to reflect a “discretionary deci-\nsion” by the district court that “accords with the Commis-\nsion’s view.” Rita, supra, at 351.\n   Again, this case furnishes a ready example. Prior to pe-\ntitioner’s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission\n“to consider” whether fraud guidelines were “ ‘sufficient to\ndeter and punish’ ” particular offenses, in light of increases\nto statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes\nother than bank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason\n8                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-\nCollar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,\n§905(b)(2), 116 Stat. 805). This produced amended Guide-\nlines, which were based on the Commission’s further\nassessment of “economic crime issues over a number of\nyears.” USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment)\n(effective Nov. 1, 2001). With an amended Guidelines\nsentencing range, the District Court concluded that a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence was “the most appropriate\nsentence.” App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing\nrange nor §3553(a) changed between the time of petition-\ner’s offense and sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to\nsay that reliance on information reflected in the amended\nGuidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n   This is underscored by the fact that even the Court’s\nholding—which requires district courts to calculate the\nGuidelines range in effect at the time of the offense—will\nnot eliminate the “risk” of a higher sentence. The district\njudge remains free to consider the range produced by the\namended Guidelines. See Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795 (“A\njudge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentenc-\ning Commission”). Thus, the mere fact that new Guide-\nlines have been promulgated creates some risk of an\nincreased sentence, even if district courts are required to\ncalculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.\nPetitioner has presented no evidence indicating what\nportion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the\nretroactive application of the amended Guidelines and\nwhat portion flows from their very existence. In the ab-\nsence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory\nGuidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not,\nI would not find the “risk” of an increased sentence created\nby the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be “suf-\nficient” for ex post facto purposes.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                                 II\n    Today’s opinion also demonstrates the unworkability of\nour ex post facto jurisprudence. Under our current prece-\ndent, whenever a change in the law creates a “risk” of an\nincreased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is\n“sufficient,” see Morales, 514 U. S., at 509, or sufficiently\n“ ‘significant,’ ” see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Our analysis under that test has devolved into\nlittle more than an exercise in judicial intuition. I would\nreturn to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in\nJustice Chase’s classic Calder formulation, under which\nlaws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retro-\nactively increase the punishment “annexed to the crime.”\n3 Dall., at 390.\n                             A\n   This Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere\ndecade after the Constitution was ratified. In Calder,\nJustice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws. 3\nDall., at 390. As relevant, Justice Chase’s third category\nindicated that “[e]very law that changes the punishment,\nand inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed” violates the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Ibid. Justice Chase’s emphasis on increases\nin the punishment “annexed to the crime” was grounded\nin the English common law and accurately reflected the\noriginal understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nPart II–B, infra. Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated\nfrom this formulation. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S.\n221 (1883), the Court declared that “any law passed after\nthe commission of an offence which . . . ‘in relation to that\noffence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party\nto his disadvantage,’ is an ex post facto law.” Id., at 235\n(quoting Justice Washington’s jury charge in United States\nv. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (CC Pa. 1809) (em-\nphasis added). It took nearly a century for the Court to\n10                  PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndecide that Kring’s “departure from Calder’s explanation\nof the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause\nwas . . . unjustified.” Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,\n49 (1990) (overruling Kring).\n   Following Collins’ disavowal of Kring, the Court held\nthat a law is ex post facto if it “produces a sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.” Morales, supra, at 509. While Morales\navoided the over-breadth of Kring’s “disadvantage the de-\nfendant” test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto ju-\nrisprudence to the original understanding of the term.\nThe “sufficient risk” test also depends upon empirical\nanalysis that cannot yield determinative answers and\nwhich courts are ill equipped to handle. See, e.g., Gar-\nner, 529 U. S., at 255 (“When the rule does not by its\nown terms show a significant risk, the respondent must\ndemonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule’s practical\nimplementation by the agency charged with exercising\ndiscretion, that its retroactive application will result in\na longer period of incarceration than under the earlier\nrule”). More fundamentally, the “sufficient risk” test, like\nthe “disadvantage the defendant” test, wrongly focuses on\nthe particular sentence that the defendant might receive,\nrather than on the punishment “annexed to the crime.”\n   The practical difficulties with the test are apparent even\nfrom our application in Morales, where we considered an\namendment to California’s parole procedures that allowed,\nunder certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to\ndecrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.\nUnder the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to specu-\nlate about the possible effects of the new law on various\nindividuals’ prison terms. Ultimately, we held that the\namendment did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause be-\n——————\n  * As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was\nan error to which I succumbed.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ncause the “narrow class of prisoners covered by the\namendment [could not] reasonably expect that their pro-\nspects for early release on parole would be enhanced by\nthe opportunity of annual hearings.” Morales, supra, at\n512. But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expecta-\ntions that prisoners and defendants have about how many\ndays they will spend in prison.\n                              B\n   “Although the Latin phrase ‘ex post facto’ literally en-\ncompasses any law passed ‘after the fact,’ ” Collins, 497\nU. S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase\n“was a term of art with an established meaning” at the\ntime of the founding. Ibid. Blackstone offers the first key\nto understanding this “established meaning.” He explic-\nitly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct crimi-\nnal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44\n(hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive citizens of\nnotice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to\nman’s “reason and freewill.” Id., at *39; see id., at *46.\nBlackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate. Id., at\n*44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (J. Madison) (“[E]x post facto laws . . . are contrary\nto the first principles of the social compact, and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation”). For this reason, ex post\nfacto laws have rightly been described as “formidable\ninstruments of tyranny,” id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton),\nand their prohibition a “bulwark in favour of the personal\nsecurity of the subject,” Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of\nChase, J.).\n   Although Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post\nfacto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent\nacts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were also under-\nstood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding.

Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States §679, p. 486 (Abr. 1833)\n(The “prohibition” against ex post facto laws “reaches every\nlaw . . . whereby the act, if a crime, is aggravated in enor-\nmity, or punishment”). Justice Chase’s formulation re-\nflects this understanding. Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (“Every\nlaw that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater\npunishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\ncommitted” is ex post facto). Under this view, courts must\ncompare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time\nof the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of\nsentencing. If the latter is harsher than the former, the\ncourt must apply the punishment in effect at the time of\nthe offense.\n   At common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law\nretroactively increased the punishment, because the crim-\ninal law generally “prescribed a particular sentence for\neach offense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury\non the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987). In a world of determinate sentencing, a retro-\nactive increase in the punishment affixed to a crime rend-\ners an act “punishable in a manner in which it was not\npunishable when it was committed,” Fletcher v. Peck, 6\nCranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post\nfacto violation. The key point is that “the ex post facto\n[C]lause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed\nby a statute, rather than to the sentence actually im-\nposed.” Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937).\n   Focusing on the punishment affixed by law, rather than\non the specific sentence imposed, furthers the goals of\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnotice and fair warning recognized by Blackstone as the\nrationales for the prohibition against ex post facto laws.\nSee Ross’ Case, 19 Mass. 165, 170 (1824) (“A party ought\nto know, at the time of committing the offence, the whole\nextent of the punishment; for it may sometimes be a mat-\nter of calculation, whether he will commit the offence,\nconsidering the severity of the punishment”). Because\nincreasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives\npeople of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of\nthe law, “[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems\nto come within the same mischief as the creation of a\ncrime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed to-\ngether.” Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).\n   Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a de-\nfendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not\nimplicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual\ncontemplating the commission of a given offense knows he\nmay be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed\nrange. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he\nmay even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But\nhe does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 258 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment) (“Dis-\ncretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the\nsentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of\nthe risks that the offender knowingly assumes”). The law\nprovides the defendant with only one assurance: He will\nbe sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by\nstatute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a par-\nticular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not\ndeprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the\nconcerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.\n                            C\n  The statutory range in effect at the time of petitioner’s\noffense remained in effect at his sentencing. The Guide-\n14               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nlines sentencing range is not the punishment affixed to the\noffense. See in Part I–A, supra. Accordingly, sentencing\npetitioner under the amended Guidelines did not violate\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause. Because the Court concludes\notherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.
