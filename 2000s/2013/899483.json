UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12\u201362. Argued February 26, 2013\u2014Decided June 10, 2013\nPetitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct\n  that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing, he argued that the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\n  version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of\n  his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time\n  of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh\u2019s sentencing range\n  was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe\n  consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The\n  District Court rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim and sentenced him\n  to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n675 F. 3d 736, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part III\u2013C, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when\n  a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he\n  committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher\n  sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\n  Pp. 4\u201313, 15\u201320.\n    (a) Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 543\n  U. S. 220, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing\n  procedures. A district court must begin \u201cby correctly calculating the\n  applicable Guidelines range,\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49,\n  and then consider the parties\u2019 arguments and factors specified in 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73553(a). 552 U. S., at 49\u201350. The court \u201cmay not presume\n  that the Guidelines range is reasonable,\u201d id., at 50, and must explain\n  the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid. On appeal, a sentence is\n  reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n2                      PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 51. A district court is to apply the Guidelines \u201cin effect on the\n    date the defendant is sentenced,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the\n    Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense\n    was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date\n    be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a cat-\n    egory including, as relevant here, \u201c[e]very law that changes the pun-\n    ishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to\n    the crime, when committed.\u201d Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. The\n    \u201cscope of this Latin phrase\u201d is given \u201csubstance by an accretion of\n    case law.\u201d Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292. The touchstone of\n    the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a \u201c \u2018sufficient\n    risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\n    crimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (c) The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.\n    423. There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the peti-\n    tioner was sentenced under Florida\u2019s new sentencing guidelines,\n    which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place\n    at the time of his crime. The pre-existing guidelines would have re-\n    quired the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons\n    in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been re-\n    viewable on appeal. But under the new guidelines, a sentence within\n    the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.\n    Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the\n    ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sen-\n    tence. Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a\n    significant risk of a higher sentence.\n       The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing\n    scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentenc-\n    ing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines. Normally, a \u201cjudge will\n    use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and\n    impose a sentence within the range.\u201d Freeman v. United States, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. That the court may impose a sentence outside that\n    range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for\n    sentencing. Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for rea-\n    sonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark. Appellate courts\n    may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v.\n    United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347, and may \u201cconsider the extent of the\n    deviation\u201d from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness re-\n    view, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The sentencing regime also puts in place\n    procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-\n    Guidelines sentence less likely. Florida\u2019s scheme and the federal re-\n    gime differ, but those differences are not dispositive. Common sense\n    indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evi-\n  dence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect. A retrospective\n  increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient\n  risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n     (d) The Government\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Its\n  principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal\n  effect to attain the status of a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of the Ex\n  Post Facto Clause. Changes in law need not bind a sentencing au-\n  thority for there to be an ex post facto violation, and \u201c[t]he presence of\n  discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.\u201d Garner,\n  529 U. S., at 253. As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines\n  and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two sys-\n  tems is one in degree, not in kind. The attributes of post-Booker sen-\n  tencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many per-\n  suasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.\n  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-\n  Booker Sixth Amendment cases. The Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases,\n  which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a de-\n  fendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its\n  ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a\n  \u201csignificant risk\u201d of a higher sentence. The Booker remedy was de-\n  signed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this\n  distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth\n  Amendment violation. Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of\n  such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall. Pp. 15\u201319.\n\n   SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nIII\u2013C.

The U. S.\nSentencing Guidelines set forth an advisory sentencing\nrange for each defendant convicted in federal court. We\nconsider here whether there is an ex post facto violation\nwhen a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promul-\ngated after he committed his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing\nrange than the version in place at the time of the offense.\nWe hold that there is.\n                             I\n  Petitioner Marvin Peugh and his cousin, Steven Holle-\nwell, ran two farming-related businesses in Illinois. Grain-\nery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc.,\nprovided farming services to landowners and tenants.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *JUSTICE KENNEDY joins this opinion except as to Part III\u2013C.\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWhen the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow prob-\nlems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent\nschemes. First, they obtained a series of bank loans by\nrepresenting falsely the existence of contracts for future\ngrain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery. When\nthey failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the\nbank suffered losses of over $2 million. Second, they ar-\ntificially inflated the balances of accounts under their con-\ntrol by \u201ccheck kiting,\u201d or writing bad checks between their\naccounts. This scheme allowed them to overdraw an\naccount by $471,000. They engaged in their illicit conduct\nin 1999 and 2000.\n   When their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell\nwere charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation\nof 18 U. S. C. \u00a71344. While Hollewell pleaded guilty to\none count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and\nwent to trial, where he testified that he had not intended\nto defraud the banks. The jury found him guilty of five\ncounts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining\ncounts.\n   At sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto\nClause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\nversion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at\nthe time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 ver-\nsion in effect at the time of sentencing. The two versions\nyielded significantly different results for Peugh\u2019s applica-\nble Guidelines sentencing range. Under the 1998 Guide-\nlines, Peugh\u2019s base offense level was 6. United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72F1.1 (Nov.\n1998) (USSG). Thirteen levels were added for a loss\namount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruc-\ntion of justice because of Peugh\u2019s perjury at trial, see\nUSSG \u00a73C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under\nthe 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19. As a first-time\noffender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and\nso his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto 37 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).\n  The 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sen-\ntenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to\nhis acts. First, the base offense level was raised from 6\nto 7 for crimes, like Peugh\u2019s, that have a statutory maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. See USSG\n\u00a72B1.1 (Nov. 2009); 18 U. S. C. \u00a71344. Second, the en-\nhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a\n5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines. USSG 2B1.1\n(Nov. 2009). After adding the 2-level enhancement for\nobstruction of justice, Peugh\u2019s total offense level under the\n2009 Guidelines was 27. With a Criminal History Cate-\ngory of I, Peugh\u2019s sentencing range rose under the 2009\nGuidelines to 70 to 87 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.\n2009). The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33\nmonths higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines\nrange.\n  At the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected\nPeugh\u2019s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines vio-\nlated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was fore-\nclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent. App. 30 (discussing\nUnited States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791 (2006)). The\nDistrict Court declined to give Peugh a downward vari-\nance, concluding that \u201ca sentence within the [G]uideline[s]\nrange is the most appropriate sentence in this case,\u201d App.\n100. It sentenced Peugh to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment,\nibid., the bottom of the 2009 Guidelines range.\n  The Seventh Circuit, in keeping with its decision in\nDemaree, rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim and affirmed\nhis conviction and sentence. 675 F. 3d 736 (2012). We\ngranted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the Ex Post Facto Clause may be\nviolated when a defendant is sentenced under the version\nof the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sen-\ntencing rather than the version in effect at the time the\ncrime was committed, and the newer Guidelines yield a\n4                   PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhigher applicable sentencing range.1 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nWe now reverse.\n                             II\n  Prior to 1984, the broad discretion of sentencing courts\nand parole officers had led to significant sentencing dis-\nparities among similarly situated offenders. To address\nthis problem, Congress created the United States Sentenc-\ning Commission. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n362, 366\u2013367 (1989). The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n98 Stat. 1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and\ndirected the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uni-\nform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at\nsentencing. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. The Commission\nproduced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a sys-\ntem under which a set of inputs specific to a given case\n(the particular characteristics of the offense and offender)\nyielded a predetermined output (a range of months within\nwhich the defendant could be sentenced).\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 244 (2005),\nhowever, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran\nafoul of the Sixth Amendment by allowing judges to find\nfacts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond \u201cthe\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict.\u201d See also Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The appropriate remedy for\nthis violation, the Court determined, was to strike those\nportions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory. Booker, 543 U. S., at 245\u2013258.\nUnder the resulting scheme, a district court is still re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Compare United States v.

See id., at 259\u2013260, 264;\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A). But the Guidelines are no\nlonger binding, and the district court must consider all of\nthe factors set forth in \u00a73553(a) to guide its discretion at\nsentencing, see Booker, 543 U. S., at 259\u2013260, 264. The\nBooker remedy, \u201cwhile not the system Congress enacted,\u201d\nwas designed to \u201ccontinue to move sentencing in Congress\u2019\npreferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing\ndisparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to indi-\nvidualize sentences where necessary.\u201d Id., at 264\u2013265.\n   Our subsequent decisions have clarified the role that\nthe Guidelines play in sentencing procedures, both at the\ndistrict court level and when sentences are reviewed on\nappeal. First, \u201ca district court should begin all sentencing\nproceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guide-\nlines range. As a matter of administration and to secure\nnationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the\nstarting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d Gall v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted). The\ndistrict court must then consider the arguments of the par-\nties and the factors set forth in \u00a73553(a). Id., at 49\u201350.\nThe district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines\nrange is reasonable,\u201d id., at 50; and it \u201cmay in appropriate\ncases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on dis-\nagreement with the [Sentencing] Commission\u2019s views,\u201d Pep-\nper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 23) (citing Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,\n109\u2013110 (2007)). The district court must explain the basis\nfor its chosen sentence on the record. Gall, 552 U. S., at\n50. \u201c[A] major departure [from the Guidelines] should be\nsupported by a more significant justification than a minor\none.\u201d Ibid.\n   On appeal, the district court\u2019s sentence is reviewed for\nreasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee id., at 51; Booker, 543 U. S., at 261\u2013264. Failure to\ncalculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes proce-\n6                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndural error, as does treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\nGall, 552 U. S., at 51. The court of appeals may, but is\nnot required to, presume that a within-Guidelines sentence\nis reasonable. Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347\n(2007). The reviewing court may not apply a heightened\nstandard of review or a presumption of unreasonableness\nto sentences outside the Guidelines range, although it\n\u201cwill, of course, take into account the totality of the cir-\ncumstances, including the extent of any variance from the\nGuidelines range.\u201d Gall, 552 U. S., at 49\u201351. We have in-\ndicated that \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to vary from the\nadvisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when\u201d it\nis based on the particular facts of a case. Kimbrough, 552\nU.

Peugh\u2019s claim is that\nthe Clause was violated because the 2009 Guidelines call\nfor a greater punishment than attached to bank fraud in\n2000, when his crimes were completed. The Government\ncounters that because the more punitive Guidelines ap-\nplied at Peugh\u2019s sentencing were only advisory, there was\nno ex post facto problem.\n   Each of the parties can point to prior decisions of this\nCourt that lend support to its view. On the one hand, we\nhave never accepted the proposition that a law must in-\ncrease the maximum sentence for which a defendant is\neligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See,\ne.g., Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937). More-\nover, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some\nmeasure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto\nclaim. See Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 253 (2000). On\nthe other hand, we have made it clear that mere specula-\ntion or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively\nincrease the punishment for a crime will not suffice to\nestablish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nCalifornia Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,\n509 (1995). The touchstone of this Court\u2019s inquiry is\nwhether a given change in law presents a \u201c \u2018sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner, 529 U.

Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), in which this\nCourt considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing\nguidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.\nUnder Florida\u2019s system, a calculation under the guidelines\nyielded a presumptive sentencing range. Id., at 426. This\nrange was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing\njudge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range\n\u201c \u2018without the requirement of a written explanation.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)).\nIf the court wished to depart from the guidelines range,\nhowever, it was required to give \u201cclear and convincing\nreasons in writing for doing so.\u201d 482 U. S., at 426. A\nwithin-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a non-\nguidelines sentence was subject to appellate review. Ibid.\n   The petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new\nguidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than\nthe guidelines that had been in place at the time of his\ncrime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new\nrange. Ibid. This Court found an ex post facto violation.\nWe emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner\u2019s\nsentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentenc-\ning judge would have been required to provide clear and\nconvincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the\nsentence would then have been reviewable on appeal. Id.,\nat 432. In contrast, because the sentence imposed was\nwithin the new guidelines range, it required no explana-\ntion and was unreviewable. Id., at 432\u2013433. The fact that\nFlorida\u2019s guidelines \u201ccreate[d] a high hurdle that must be\ncleared before discretion can be exercised\u201d was sufficient\nto render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law. Id.,\nat 435.\n   Miller thus establishes that applying amended sentenc-\ning guidelines that increase a defendant\u2019s recommended\n10                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwith-\nstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion\nto deviate from the recommended sentencing range. The\nsentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sen-\ntences for similarly situated offenders into a specified\nrange. Its reason-giving requirements and standards of\nappellate review meant that while variation was possible,\nit was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defend-\nant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Under the\nFlorida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines\nrange applicable to an offender created a significant risk\nthat he would receive a higher sentence.4 The same prin-\nciples apply here.\n   The post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to\nachieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions\nare anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a\nmeaningful benchmark through the process of appellate\nreview. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107. As we have\ndescribed, \u201cdistrict courts must begin their analysis with\nthe Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout\nthe sentencing process.\u201d Gall, 552 U. S., at 50, n. 6 (em-\nphasis added). Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines\nrange constitutes procedural error. Id., at 51. A district\ncourt contemplating a non-Guidelines sentence \u201cmust con-\nsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\njustification is sufficiently compelling to support the de-\ngree of the variance.\u201d Id., at 50.

United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5). Even if the sen-\ntencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, \u201cif\nthe judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point\nto explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guide-\nlines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (stating that out-\nside the context of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, \u201cin the normal course the\ndistrict judge\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range appli-\ncable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the\nterm of imprisonment imposed\u201d). That a district court\nmay ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the\nGuidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force\nas the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that\nan incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error en-\nsures that they remain the starting point for every sen-\ntencing calculation in the federal system.\n   Similarly, appellate review for reasonableness using the\nGuidelines as a benchmark helps promote uniformity by\n\u201ctend[ing] to iron out sentencing differences.\u201d Booker, 543\nU. S., at 263. Courts of appeals may presume a within-\nGuidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita, 551 U. S.,\nat 347, and they may further \u201cconsider the extent of the\ndeviation\u201d from the Guidelines as part of their reason-\nableness review, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. As in Miller, then,\nthe post-Booker sentencing regime puts in place proce-\ndural \u201churdle[s]\u201d that, in practice, make the imposition of\na non-Guidelines sentence less likely. See 482 U. S., at 435.\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a more difficult case than Miller, because there\nare relevant differences between Florida\u2019s sentencing\nscheme and the current federal sentencing regime. The\nFlorida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sen-\ntence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the\ncourts of appeals may\u2014but are not required to\u2014presume\nthat a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. And\nunder Florida\u2019s scheme, a sentencing court departing from\nthe guideline range was required to provide \u201cclear and\nconvincing\u201d reasons for the departure; whereas this Court\nhas not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-the-\nboard standard of review to variances. Rather, we have\nheld that a district court varying from the Federal Guide-\nlines should provide an explanation adequate to the extent\nof the departure. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 51.\n   But contrary to the arguments advanced by the Gov-\nernment and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent (hereinafter dis-\nsent), see Brief for United States 23\u201324; post, at 5\u20136,\nthese differences are not dispositive. Although the federal\nsystem\u2019s procedural rules establish gentler checks on\nthe sentencing court\u2019s discretion than Florida\u2019s did, they\nnevertheless impose a series of requirements on sentenc-\ning courts that cabin the exercise of that discretion.\nCommon sense indicates that in general, this system will\nsteer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences.\n   Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicat-\ning that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended\neffect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\nEven after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines\nadvisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases\nimposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences\nthat depart downward from the Guidelines on the Gov-\nernment\u2019s motion.

See also Baron-Evans & Stith, Booker Rules,\n160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012).

See USSC, Final Quarterly Data Report, FY 2012,\np. 32 (Figure C); USSC, Report on the Continuing Impact\nof United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing, Pt. A,\npp. 60\u201368 (2012).5\n   The federal system adopts procedural measures intended\nto make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A\nretrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable\nto a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sen-\ntence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n                             C\n  Our holding today is consistent with basic principles of\nfairness that animate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The\nFramers considered ex post facto laws to be \u201ccontrary to\nthe first principles of the social compact and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation.\u201d The Federalist No. 44,\np. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Clause\nensures that individuals have fair warning of applicable\nlaws and guards against vindictive legislative action. See\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28\u201329 (1981); see also\npost, at 11\u201313. Even where these concerns are not directly\nimplicated, however, the Clause also safeguards \u201ca fun-\ndamental fairness interest . . . in having the government\nabide by the rules of law it establishes to govern the cir-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Government does not dispute these statistics. It argues instead\n\nthat by relying on aggregated data, Peugh glosses over the fact that\nnon-Guidelines sentences are more common for certain crimes and that\nsome individual judges are less likely to follow the Guidelines than\nothers. Brief for United States 49\u201350. But these arguments do not\nrefute the basic point that the applicable Guidelines channel sentences\ntoward the specified range, even if they do not fix them within it.\n14               PEUGH v.

S., at 533.\n   The Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Gov-\nernment\u2019s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences\nfor specific crimes. When Peugh committed his crime,\nthe recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months. When he\nwas sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months. \u201c[T]he purpose\nand effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation]\nwas to increase the rates and length of incarceration for\n[fraud].\u201d Miller, 482 U. S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar:\nAmendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988\u2014\nSentencing Guidelines), 451 So. 2d 824, 824, n. (1984) ( per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted)). Such a retrospective increase in the measure of\npunishment raises clear ex post facto concerns. We have\npreviously recognized, for instance, that a defendant\ncharged with an increased punishment for his crime is\nlikely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty. See\nCarmell, 529 U. S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U. S., at\n32. This pressure does not disappear simply because the\nGuidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware\nthat the range is intended to, and usually does, exert\ncontrolling influence on the sentence that the court will\nimpose.\n   We are therefore not persuaded by the argument ad-\nvanced by the Government and also suggested by the\ndissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto\nClause are not implicated by this case. While the Gov-\nernment argues that the Sentencing Commission is insu-\nlated from legislative interference, see Brief for United\nStates 42\u201344, our precedents make clear that the coverage\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative\nacts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a\nchange in a parole board\u2019s rules could, given an adequate\nshowing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause). It is true\nthat we held, in Irizarry v.

But, contrary to\nthe dissent\u2019s view, see post, at 11\u201313, the Ex Post Facto\nClause does not merely protect reliance interests. It also\nreflects principles of \u201cfundamental justice.\u201d Carmell, 529\nU. S., at 531.6\n                              IV\n   The Government\u2019s principal argument that there is no\nconstitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing\nGuidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the sta-\ntus of a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines \u201cha[d] the force\nand effect of laws,\u201d Booker, 543 U. S., at 234, the post-\nBooker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that\nstatus due to their advisory nature. The dissent echoes\nthis argument. Post, at 1\u20133, 6\u20138.\n   The distinction that the Government draws is necessar-\nily a fine one, because our precedents firmly establish that\nchanges in law need not bind a sentencing authority in\norder to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, for example,\na law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter\nthe statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.\nIn Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, this Court con-\nsidered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law\naltering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a\nrange of 0 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment to a mandatory term\nof 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Although the upper boundary\nof the sentencing court\u2019s power to punish remained un-\nchanged, it was enough that the petitioners were \u201cde-\nprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Ofcourse, \u201cwhile the principle of unfairness helps explain and shape\nthe Clause\u2019s scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force.\u201d Carmell, 529 U. S., at\n533, n. 23.\n16               PEUGH v.

S., at 253. In a series of\ncases, for example, this Court has considered the validity\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the\nterms on which discretionary parole or early release was\navailable to prisoners. See Garner, 529 U. S. 244; Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S. 499; Weaver, 450 U. S. 24. Although these\ncases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether\nthere was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did\nwe indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not\nguaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the\nparole board was fatal to his claim. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 253; Morales, 514 U. S., at 508\u2013510, and n. 6; Weaver,\n450 U. S., at 30\u201331.\n   The Government does not challenge these holdings but\nrather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much\nlike guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise\nto an ex post facto violation. It contrasts the Sentenc-\ning Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller,\nwhich, the Government indicates, really did place \u201ca sub-\nstantial legislative constraint on the judge\u2019s exercise of\nsentencing discretion.\u201d Brief for United States 21. But as\nwe have explained at length, the difference between the\nfederal system and the scheme the Court considered in\nMiller is one in degree, not in kind. The Florida system\ndid not achieve its \u201cbinding legal effect,\u201d Brief for United\nStates 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in\nevery case. Rather, it achieved its \u201cbinding legal effect\u201d\nthrough a set of procedural rules and standards for appel-\nlate review that, in combination, encouraged district\ncourts to sentence within the guidelines.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are\nreviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136.\n   While the Government accurately describes several\nattributes of federal sentencing after Booker, the conclu-\nsion it draws by isolating these features of the system is\nultimately not supportable. On the Government\u2019s account,\nthe Guidelines are just one among many persuasive\nsources a sentencing court can consult, no different from\na \u201cpolicy paper.\u201d Brief for United States 28. The Govern-\nment\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that\ndistrict courts are not required to consult any policy paper\nin order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must\nthey \u201cconsider the extent of [their] deviation\u201d from a given\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Government likens the Sentencing Guidelines system to the\n\nParole Commission\u2019s Parole Release Guidelines, which established an\nadvisory framework for parole decisions, see United States Parole\nComm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980), and argues that Miller\nindicated that retrospectively applying more stringent parole guidelines\nwould not have constituted an ex post facto violation. The issue of\nthe constitutional validity of the retrospective application of the parole\nguidelines, however, was not before the Court in Miller. While the\nMiller Court did state that lower court cases discussing the federal\nparole guidelines were \u201cinapposite\u201d to its discussion of the Florida\nguidelines, 482 U. S., at 434\u2013435, it had no occasion to address whether\nchanges to the parole guidelines generated an ex post facto problem.\n18               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy paper and \u201censure that the justification is suffi-\nciently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\u201d\nGall, 552 U. S., at 50. Courts of appeals, in turn, are not\npermitted to presume that a sentence that comports with\na particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of\nappeals, in considering whether the district court\u2019s sen-\ntence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure\nfrom a given policy paper in determining whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion, see id., at 51. It is\nsimply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are\nmerely a volume that the district court reads with aca-\ndemic interest in the course of sentencing.\n    Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,\nnotwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a\nhigher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nsentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration\nto the current version of the Guidelines as representing\nthe most recent views of the agency charged by Congress\nwith developing sentencing policy. See post, at 8 (citing\nDemaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795). But this does not render our\nholding \u201cpurely semantic.\u201d Id., at 795. District courts\nmust begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines\nin effect at the time of the offense and use them to calcu-\nlate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines\nwill anchor both the district court\u2019s discretion and the\nappellate review process in all of the ways we have de-\nscribed. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the\nstatus of one of many reasons a district court might give\nfor deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is\nsimply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.\n     Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the\nEx Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an\nincreased Guidelines range would be in tension with this\nCourt\u2019s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would \u201clargely undo\n. . . the Booker remedy\u201d for the Sixth Amendment violation\nfound there. Brief for United States 35. If the Guidelines\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare binding enough to trigger an ex post facto violation, the\nargument goes, then they must be binding enough to\ntrigger a Sixth Amendment violation as well. The Gov-\nernment\u2019s argument assumes that the Sixth Amendment\nand the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary;\nthat only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher\nsentence in a manner that raises Sixth Amendment con-\ncerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determi-\nnate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But the\nSixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are\nanalytically distinct. Our Sixth Amendment cases have\nfocused on when a given finding of fact is required to make\na defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty. Our\nex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a\nchange in law creates a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of a higher sen-\ntence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the\nnew Guidelines is substantially likely. The Booker remedy\nwas designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to\nexploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote\nsentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner,\nsee supra, at 12\u201313, it appears so far to be achieving this\nbalance. Nothing that we say today \u201cundo[es]\u201d the hold-\nings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent\nsentencing cases.\n                        *    *    *\n   The arguments put forward by the Government and the\ndissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh\u2019s case\nfalls within Calder\u2019s third category of ex post facto viola-\ntions. \u201c[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [govern-\nment] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering\nthe substantive \u2018formula\u2019 used to calculate the applicable\nsentencing range.\u201d Morales, 514 U.

In such a case, the ex post facto error may be harmless. See\nChapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967). Here, however, the Gov-\nernment does not argue that any ex post facto violation was harmless.\nAnd indeed, any such argument would fail in light of the fact that the\nDistrict Court rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim in keeping with\nCircuit precedent, applied the new Guidelines, and indicated at sen-\ntencing that \u201ca sentence within the [G]uideline range is the most\nappropriate sentence in this case.\u201d App. 30, 100.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Under our precedents, the relevant\ninquiry for determining whether a law \u201cinflicts a greater\npunishment,\u201d is whether the \u201cretroactive application of\nthe change in [the] law created \u2018a sufficient risk of increas-\ning the measure of punishment attached to the covered\ncrimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250 (2000) (quot-\ning California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.\n499, 509 (1995)).

UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsons. First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion\nof district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a de-\nfendant\u2019s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended\nGuidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive\na harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guide-\nlines\u2019 persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guide-\nlines help district judges to impose sentences that comply\nwith \u00a73553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in\nessence, the risk of a more accurate sentence\u2014i.e., a sen-\ntence more in line with the statutory scheme\u2019s penological\ngoals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve\nsuch pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create\na risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. We have never held that government\naction violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it merely\ninfluences the exercise of the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion.\n                              A\n   The Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not constrain the\ndiscretion of district courts. As we have said repeatedly,\nthe Guidelines are \u201cadvisory.\u201d United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220, 245 (2005) (remedial opinion for the Court\nby BREYER, J.).

This does not\ndemonstrate that the Guidelines constrain the judge\u2019s dis-\ncretion, but rather comports with the notion that an ex-\nplanation is essential for \u201cmeaningful appellate review.\u201d\nIbid. And, when a district court departs from the recom-\nmended range, the court of appeals may not presume that\nsuch a sentence is unreasonable.

Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795\n(CA7 2006).\n   None of petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary is per-\nsuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines\nconstrain district courts\u2019 discretion because improperly\ncalculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error.\nBrief for Petitioner 20\u201321, and n. 7; 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(f);\nCf. Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. This argument is a non sequi-\ntur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose\nif district courts consider the \u201crange established\u201d by the\n4                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nGuidelines, \u00a73553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts\nmust \u201cbegin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calcu-\nlating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d Id., at 49. But\nthe fact that courts must give due consideration to the\nrecommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does\nnot mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court\u2019s\ndiscretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply\nmeans that district courts must consider the correct vari-\nables before exercising their discretion.\n   Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district\ncourt discretion because sentences falling outside the\nGuidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive\nunreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, how-\never, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district\njudge can justify his sentence based on agreement with\neither of two Guidelines\u2014the old or the new. If a dis-\ntrict court calculated the sentencing range under the\nnew Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a below-\nGuidelines sentence that fell within the range provided\nby the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such\na sentence \u201csubstantively unreasonable.\u201d To do so would\ncast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued un-\nder the old Guidelines. Similarly, it is hard to imagine\nthat a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for sub-\nstantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell\nwithin the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This\ncase provides an apt example. After considering all of\nthe \u00a73553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines range was \u201cthe\nmost appropriate sentence in this case.\u201d App. 100. The\nsame sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if\nthe District Court, on remand, once again determined that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropri-\nate in light of all the facts. The essential point is that once\nnew Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nreview does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of\ndistrict courts to sentence offenders within either of the\ntwo ranges.\n  The majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Flor-\nida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), supports its conclusion that\nretroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. See ante, at 9\u201310. But Miller leads\nto the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed\nnarrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory\nsentencing ranges for particular crimes. 482 U. S., at\n425\u2013426. If a judge imposed a sentence within that nar-\nrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written\nexplanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and\nthe sentence was not subject to appellate review. Ibid. If\nthe judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive\nrange, however, he was required to provide \u201c \u2018clear and\nconvincing reasons,\u2019 \u201d id., at 426 (quoting Fla. Rule Crim.\nProc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based \u201con facts proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt,\u201d that justified the departure, 482 U. S.,\nat 432. In concluding that retroactive application of this\nscheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned\nthat the Florida guidelines did not \u201csimply provide flexible\n\u2018guideposts\u2019 for use in the exercise of discretion: instead,\nthey create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before\ndiscretion c[ould] be exercised.\u201d Id., at 435.\n  The Court cites Miller for the proposition \u201cthat applying\namended sentencing guidelines that increase a defend-\nant\u2019s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts\npossess discretion to deviate from the recommended sen-\ntencing range.\u201d Ante, at 10. But that claim is not sup-\nported by Miller. The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the\nsentencing judge\u2019s discretion.\n  The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.\nIndeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly\n6                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that the Guidelines do not create a \u201chigh hurdle\u201d\u2014\nor any hurdle at all\u2014\u201cthat must be cleared before discre-\ntion can be exercised.\u201d Miller, 482 U. S., at 435. Rather,\nthe Guidelines are \u201cflexible \u2018guideposts\u2019 \u201d which inform the\ndistrict courts\u2019 discretion. Ibid. Accordingly, their retro-\nactive application cannot constitute a violation of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause.\n                               B\n  Notwithstanding the discretion district courts have to\nimpose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statu-\ntory range, Guidelines do \u201cinfluenc[e] the sentences im-\nposed by judges.\u201d Ante, at 12. But, the Guidelines do this\nby helping district courts impose sentences that are con-\nsistent with \u00a73553(a). It is difficult to see how an advi-\nsory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences\nmore in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever\nconstitute an ex post facto violation. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court concludes.\n  District courts are charged with imposing sentences that\nare \u201c \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to comply\nwith the sentencing purposes set forth in\u201d \u00a73553(a). Pep-\nper, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting \u00a73553(a)).\nThe district court\u2019s task is to impose sentences that reflect\nthe punitive goals of justice, deterrence, protection of the\npublic, and rehabilitation. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2). While\neasily stated, this goal is difficult to achieve. Enter the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the Sen-\ntencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect\nthe \u201csame basic \u00a73553(a) objectives\u201d that district courts\nmust consider. Rita, 551 U. S., at 348; see also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7991(b)(1)(A).

The Commission then \u201cmodif[ied]\nand adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater\nrationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with con-\ngressional instructions, and the like.\u201d Rita, supra, at 349.\nWhile an individual judge has limited experience upon\nwhich to draw, the Commission \u201chas the capacity . . . to\nbase its determinations on empirical data and national\nexperience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate\nexpertise.\u201d Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 109\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Com-\nmission updates the Guidelines regularly as new infor-\nmation becomes available. It consults with \u201cprosecutors,\ndefenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associa-\ntions, experts in penology, and others,\u201d to ensure that the\nGuidelines continue to further \u00a73553(a)\u2019s goals. Rita,\nsupra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U. S., at 263 (noting\nthat the Commission would \u201cmodify its Guidelines in light\nof what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be\nbetter sentencing practices\u201d).\n   In light of this extensive study, amendments to the\nGuidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better\ncomport with the \u00a73553(a) factors. If the Commission has\nfulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are\ngenerally consistent with \u00a73553(a)(2), then sentences\nshould fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.\nThis, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences\nare presumed, on appeal, to reflect a \u201cdiscretionary deci-\nsion\u201d by the district court that \u201caccords with the Commis-\nsion\u2019s view.\u201d Rita, supra, at 351.\n   Again, this case furnishes a ready example. Prior to pe-\ntitioner\u2019s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission\n\u201cto consider\u201d whether fraud guidelines were \u201c \u2018sufficient to\ndeter and punish\u2019 \u201d particular offenses, in light of increases\nto statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes\nother than bank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason\n8                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-\nCollar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,\n\u00a7905(b)(2), 116 Stat. 805). This produced amended Guide-\nlines, which were based on the Commission\u2019s further\nassessment of \u201ceconomic crime issues over a number of\nyears.\u201d USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment)\n(effective Nov. 1, 2001). With an amended Guidelines\nsentencing range, the District Court concluded that a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence was \u201cthe most appropriate\nsentence.\u201d App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing\nrange nor \u00a73553(a) changed between the time of petition-\ner\u2019s offense and sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to\nsay that reliance on information reflected in the amended\nGuidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n   This is underscored by the fact that even the Court\u2019s\nholding\u2014which requires district courts to calculate the\nGuidelines range in effect at the time of the offense\u2014will\nnot eliminate the \u201crisk\u201d of a higher sentence. The district\njudge remains free to consider the range produced by the\namended Guidelines. See Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795 (\u201cA\njudge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentenc-\ning Commission\u201d). Thus, the mere fact that new Guide-\nlines have been promulgated creates some risk of an\nincreased sentence, even if district courts are required to\ncalculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.\nPetitioner has presented no evidence indicating what\nportion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the\nretroactive application of the amended Guidelines and\nwhat portion flows from their very existence. In the ab-\nsence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory\nGuidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not,\nI would not find the \u201crisk\u201d of an increased sentence created\nby the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be \u201csuf-\nficient\u201d for ex post facto purposes.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Under our current prece-\ndent, whenever a change in the law creates a \u201crisk\u201d of an\nincreased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is\n\u201csufficient,\u201d see Morales, 514 U. S., at 509, or sufficiently\n\u201c \u2018significant,\u2019 \u201d see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Our analysis under that test has devolved into\nlittle more than an exercise in judicial intuition. I would\nreturn to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in\nJustice Chase\u2019s classic Calder formulation, under which\nlaws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retro-\nactively increase the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201d\n3 Dall., at 390.\n                             A\n   This Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere\ndecade after the Constitution was ratified. In Calder,\nJustice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws. 3\nDall., at 390. As relevant, Justice Chase\u2019s third category\nindicated that \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment,\nand inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed\u201d violates the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Ibid. Justice Chase\u2019s emphasis on increases\nin the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime\u201d was grounded\nin the English common law and accurately reflected the\noriginal understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nPart II\u2013B, infra. Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated\nfrom this formulation. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S.\n221 (1883), the Court declared that \u201cany law passed after\nthe commission of an offence which . . . \u2018in relation to that\noffence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party\nto his disadvantage,\u2019 is an ex post facto law.\u201d Id., at 235\n(quoting Justice Washington\u2019s jury charge in United States\nv. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (CC Pa. 1809) (em-\nphasis added). It took nearly a century for the Court to\n10                  PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndecide that Kring\u2019s \u201cdeparture from Calder\u2019s explanation\nof the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause\nwas . . . unjustified.\u201d Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,\n49 (1990) (overruling Kring).\n   Following Collins\u2019 disavowal of Kring, the Court held\nthat a law is ex post facto if it \u201cproduces a sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.\u201d Morales, supra, at 509. While Morales\navoided the over-breadth of Kring\u2019s \u201cdisadvantage the de-\nfendant\u201d test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto ju-\nrisprudence to the original understanding of the term.\uf02a\nThe \u201csufficient risk\u201d test also depends upon empirical\nanalysis that cannot yield determinative answers and\nwhich courts are ill equipped to handle. See, e.g., Gar-\nner, 529 U. S., at 255 (\u201cWhen the rule does not by its\nown terms show a significant risk, the respondent must\ndemonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\u2019s practical\nimplementation by the agency charged with exercising\ndiscretion, that its retroactive application will result in\na longer period of incarceration than under the earlier\nrule\u201d). More fundamentally, the \u201csufficient risk\u201d test, like\nthe \u201cdisadvantage the defendant\u201d test, wrongly focuses on\nthe particular sentence that the defendant might receive,\nrather than on the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201d\n   The practical difficulties with the test are apparent even\nfrom our application in Morales, where we considered an\namendment to California\u2019s parole procedures that allowed,\nunder certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to\ndecrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.\nUnder the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to specu-\nlate about the possible effects of the new law on various\nindividuals\u2019 prison terms. Ultimately, we held that the\namendment did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause be-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was\nan error to which I succumbed.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expecta-\ntions that prisoners and defendants have about how many\ndays they will spend in prison.\n                              B\n   \u201cAlthough the Latin phrase \u2018ex post facto\u2019 literally en-\ncompasses any law passed \u2018after the fact,\u2019 \u201d Collins, 497\nU. S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase\n\u201cwas a term of art with an established meaning\u201d at the\ntime of the founding. Ibid. Blackstone offers the first key\nto understanding this \u201cestablished meaning.\u201d He explic-\nitly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct crimi-\nnal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44\n(hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive citizens of\nnotice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to\nman\u2019s \u201creason and freewill.\u201d Id., at *39; see id., at *46.\nBlackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate. Id., at\n*44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (J. Madison) (\u201c[E]x post facto laws . . . are contrary\nto the first principles of the social compact, and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation\u201d). For this reason, ex post\nfacto laws have rightly been described as \u201cformidable\ninstruments of tyranny,\u201d id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton),\nand their prohibition a \u201cbulwark in favour of the personal\nsecurity of the subject,\u201d Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of\nChase, J.).\n   Although Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post\nfacto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent\nacts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were also under-\nstood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding. See,\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ne.g., 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of\nEngland, as treated in a Course of Vinerian Lectures 638\n(1792) (discussing \u201cacts of parliament, which principally\naffect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or\ncreating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the\nordinary course of law\u201d); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the\nConstitution of the United States \u00a7679, p. 486 (Abr. 1833)\n(The \u201cprohibition\u201d against ex post facto laws \u201creaches every\nlaw . . . whereby the act, if a crime, is aggravated in enor-\nmity, or punishment\u201d). Justice Chase\u2019s formulation re-\nflects this understanding. Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (\u201cEvery\nlaw that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater\npunishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\ncommitted\u201d is ex post facto). Under this view, courts must\ncompare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time\nof the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of\nsentencing. If the latter is harsher than the former, the\ncourt must apply the punishment in effect at the time of\nthe offense.\n   At common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law\nretroactively increased the punishment, because the crim-\ninal law generally \u201cprescribed a particular sentence for\neach offense.\u201d Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury\non the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700\u20131900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987). In a world of determinate sentencing, a retro-\nactive increase in the punishment affixed to a crime rend-\ners an act \u201cpunishable in a manner in which it was not\npunishable when it was committed,\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6\nCranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post\nfacto violation. The key point is that \u201cthe ex post facto\n[C]lause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed\nby a statute, rather than to the sentence actually im-\nposed.\u201d Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, 401 (1937).\n   Focusing on the punishment affixed by law, rather than\non the specific sentence imposed, furthers the goals of\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nnotice and fair warning recognized by Blackstone as the\nrationales for the prohibition against ex post facto laws.\nSee Ross\u2019 Case, 19 Mass. 165, 170 (1824) (\u201cA party ought\nto know, at the time of committing the offence, the whole\nextent of the punishment; for it may sometimes be a mat-\nter of calculation, whether he will commit the offence,\nconsidering the severity of the punishment\u201d). Because\nincreasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives\npeople of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of\nthe law, \u201c[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems\nto come within the same mischief as the creation of a\ncrime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed to-\ngether.\u201d Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).\n   Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a de-\nfendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not\nimplicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual\ncontemplating the commission of a given offense knows he\nmay be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed\nrange. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he\nmay even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But\nhe does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 258 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment) (\u201cDis-\ncretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the\nsentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of\nthe risks that the offender knowingly assumes\u201d). The law\nprovides the defendant with only one assurance: He will\nbe sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by\nstatute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a par-\nticular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not\ndeprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the\nconcerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.\n                            C\n  The statutory range in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s\noffense remained in effect at his sentencing.

Argued February 26, 2013\u2014Decided June 10, 2013\nPetitioner Peugh was convicted of five counts of bank fraud for conduct\n  that occurred in 1999 and 2000. At sentencing, he argued that the\n  Ex Post Facto Clause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\n  version of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of\n  his offenses rather than under the 2009 version in effect at the time\n  of sentencing. Under the 1998 Guidelines, Peugh\u2019s sentencing range\n  was 30 to 37 months, but the 2009 Guidelines assigned more severe\n  consequences to his acts, yielding a range of 70 to 87 months. The\n  District Court rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim and sentenced him\n  to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n675 F. 3d 736, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to\n  Part III\u2013C, concluding that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated when\n  a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he\n  committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher\n  sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense.\n  Pp. 4\u201313, 15\u201320.\n    (a) Though no longer mandatory, see United States v. Booker, 543\n  U. S. 220, the Guidelines still play an important role in sentencing\n  procedures. A district court must begin \u201cby correctly calculating the\n  applicable Guidelines range,\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U. S. 38, 49,\n  and then consider the parties\u2019 arguments and factors specified in 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a73553(a). 552 U. S., at 49\u201350. The court \u201cmay not presume\n  that the Guidelines range is reasonable,\u201d id., at 50, and must explain\n  the basis for its sentence on the record, ibid. On appeal, a sentence is\n  reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n2                      PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Id., at 51. A district court is to apply the Guidelines \u201cin effect on the\n    date the defendant is sentenced,\u201d \u00a73553(a)(4)(A)(ii), but, per the\n    Guidelines, is to use the Guidelines in effect on the date the offense\n    was committed should the Guidelines in effect on the sentencing date\n    be found to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Pp. 4\u20137.\n       (b) The Constitution forbids the passage of ex post facto laws, a cat-\n    egory including, as relevant here, \u201c[e]very law that changes the pun-\n    ishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to\n    the crime, when committed.\u201d Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390. The\n    \u201cscope of this Latin phrase\u201d is given \u201csubstance by an accretion of\n    case law.\u201d Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292. The touchstone of\n    the inquiry is whether a given change in law presents a \u201c \u2018sufficient\n    risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\n    crimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250. Pp. 7\u20138.\n       (c) The most relevant prior decision is Miller v. Florida, 482 U. S.\n    423. There, the Court found an ex post facto violation when the peti-\n    tioner was sentenced under Florida\u2019s new sentencing guidelines,\n    which yielded a higher sentencing range than the guidelines in place\n    at the time of his crime. The pre-existing guidelines would have re-\n    quired the sentencing judge to provide clear and convincing reasons\n    in writing for any departure, and the sentence would have been re-\n    viewable on appeal. But under the new guidelines, a sentence within\n    the guidelines range required no explanation and was unreviewable.\n    Variation in the sentence, though possible, was burdensome; so in the\n    ordinary case, a defendant would receive a within-guidelines sen-\n    tence. Thus, increasing the applicable guidelines range created a\n    significant risk of a higher sentence.\n       The same principles apply to the post-Booker federal sentencing\n    scheme, which aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentenc-\n    ing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines. Normally, a \u201cjudge will\n    use the Guidelines range as the starting point in the analysis and\n    impose a sentence within the range.\u201d Freeman v. United States, 564\n    U. S. ___, ___. That the court may impose a sentence outside that\n    range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for\n    sentencing. Uniformity is also promoted by appellate review for rea-\n    sonableness with the Guidelines as a benchmark. Appellate courts\n    may presume a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable, see Rita v.\n    United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347, and may \u201cconsider the extent of the\n    deviation\u201d from the Guidelines as part of their reasonableness re-\n    view, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. The sentencing regime also puts in place\n    procedural hurdles that, in practice, make imposition of a non-\n    Guidelines sentence less likely. Florida\u2019s scheme and the federal re-\n    gime differ, but those differences are not dispositive. Common sense\n    indicates that the federal system generally will steer district courts to\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  more within-Guidelines sentences, and considerable empirical evi-\n  dence suggests that the Guidelines have that effect. A retrospective\n  increase in an applicable Guidelines range thus creates a sufficient\n  risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n  Pp. 9\u201313.\n     (d) The Government\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive. Its\n  principal claim is that the Sentencing Guidelines lack sufficient legal\n  effect to attain the status of a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of the Ex\n  Post Facto Clause. Changes in law need not bind a sentencing au-\n  thority for there to be an ex post facto violation, and \u201c[t]he presence of\n  discretion does not displace the protections of [that] Clause.\u201d Garner,\n  529 U. S., at 253. As for contrasts between the Federal Guidelines\n  and the Florida system in Miller, the difference between the two sys-\n  tems is one in degree, not in kind. The attributes of post-Booker sen-\n  tencing fail to show that the Guidelines are but one among many per-\n  suasive sources a sentencing court may consult in making a decision.\n  Recognizing an ex post facto violation here is consistent with post-\n  Booker Sixth Amendment cases. The Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases,\n  which focus on when a given finding of fact is required to make a de-\n  fendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty, are distinct from its\n  ex post facto cases, which focus on whether a change in law creates a\n  \u201csignificant risk\u201d of a higher sentence. The Booker remedy was de-\n  signed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to exploit precisely this\n  distinction: promoting sentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth\n  Amendment violation. Nothing in this case undoes the holdings of\n  such cases as Booker, Rita, and Gall. Pp. 15\u201319.\n\n   SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nIII\u2013C.

Grain-\nery, Inc., bought, stored, and sold grain; Agri-Tech, Inc.,\nprovided farming services to landowners and tenants.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *JUSTICE KENNEDY joins this opinion except as to Part III\u2013C.\n2                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nWhen the Grainery began experiencing cash-flow prob-\nlems, Peugh and Hollewell engaged in two fraudulent\nschemes. First, they obtained a series of bank loans by\nrepresenting falsely the existence of contracts for future\ngrain deliveries from Agri-Tech to the Grainery. When\nthey failed to pay back the principal on these loans, the\nbank suffered losses of over $2 million. Second, they ar-\ntificially inflated the balances of accounts under their con-\ntrol by \u201ccheck kiting,\u201d or writing bad checks between their\naccounts. This scheme allowed them to overdraw an\naccount by $471,000. They engaged in their illicit conduct\nin 1999 and 2000.\n   When their acts were uncovered, Peugh and Hollewell\nwere charged with nine counts of bank fraud, in violation\nof 18 U. S. C. \u00a71344. While Hollewell pleaded guilty to\none count of check kiting, Peugh pleaded not guilty and\nwent to trial, where he testified that he had not intended\nto defraud the banks. The jury found him guilty of five\ncounts of bank fraud and acquitted him of the remaining\ncounts.\n   At sentencing, Peugh argued that the Ex Post Facto\nClause required that he be sentenced under the 1998\nversion of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in effect at\nthe time of his offenses, rather than under the 2009 ver-\nsion in effect at the time of sentencing. The two versions\nyielded significantly different results for Peugh\u2019s applica-\nble Guidelines sentencing range. Under the 1998 Guide-\nlines, Peugh\u2019s base offense level was 6. United States\nSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a72F1.1 (Nov.\n1998) (USSG). Thirteen levels were added for a loss\namount of over $2.5 million, ibid., and 2 levels for obstruc-\ntion of justice because of Peugh\u2019s perjury at trial, see\nUSSG \u00a73C1.1 (Nov. 1998). The total offense level under\nthe 1998 Guidelines was therefore 19. As a first-time\noffender, Peugh was in Criminal History Category I, and\nso his sentencing range under the 1998 Guidelines was 30\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto 37 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1998).\n  The 2009 Guidelines in effect when Peugh was sen-\ntenced in May 2010 assigned more severe consequences to\nhis acts. First, the base offense level was raised from 6\nto 7 for crimes, like Peugh\u2019s, that have a statutory maxi-\nmum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. See USSG\n\u00a72B1.1 (Nov. 2009); 18 U. S. C. \u00a71344. Second, the en-\nhancement for a loss exceeding $2.5 million was 18, a\n5-level increase from the 1998 Guidelines. USSG 2B1.1\n(Nov. 2009). After adding the 2-level enhancement for\nobstruction of justice, Peugh\u2019s total offense level under the\n2009 Guidelines was 27. With a Criminal History Cate-\ngory of I, Peugh\u2019s sentencing range rose under the 2009\nGuidelines to 70 to 87 months. USSG, ch. 5, pt. A (Nov.\n2009). The low end of the 2009 Guidelines range was 33\nmonths higher than the high end of the 1998 Guidelines\nrange.\n  At the sentencing hearing, the District Court rejected\nPeugh\u2019s argument that applying the 2009 Guidelines vio-\nlated the Ex Post Facto Clause, noting that it was fore-\nclosed by Seventh Circuit precedent. App. 30 (discussing\nUnited States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791 (2006)). The\nDistrict Court declined to give Peugh a downward vari-\nance, concluding that \u201ca sentence within the [G]uideline[s]\nrange is the most appropriate sentence in this case,\u201d App.\n100. It sentenced Peugh to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment,\nibid., the bottom of the 2009 Guidelines range.\n  The Seventh Circuit, in keeping with its decision in\nDemaree, rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim and affirmed\nhis conviction and sentence. 675 F. 3d 736 (2012). We\ngranted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of\nAppeals over whether the Ex Post Facto Clause may be\nviolated when a defendant is sentenced under the version\nof the Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sen-\ntencing rather than the version in effect at the time the\ncrime was committed, and the newer Guidelines yield a\n4                   PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nhigher applicable sentencing range.1 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\nWe now reverse.\n                             II\n  Prior to 1984, the broad discretion of sentencing courts\nand parole officers had led to significant sentencing dis-\nparities among similarly situated offenders. To address\nthis problem, Congress created the United States Sentenc-\ning Commission. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361,\n362, 366\u2013367 (1989). The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,\n98 Stat. 1987, eliminated parole in the federal system and\ndirected the Sentencing Commission to promulgate uni-\nform guidelines that would be binding on federal courts at\nsentencing. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367. The Commission\nproduced the now familiar Sentencing Guidelines: a sys-\ntem under which a set of inputs specific to a given case\n(the particular characteristics of the offense and offender)\nyielded a predetermined output (a range of months within\nwhich the defendant could be sentenced).\n  In United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 244 (2005),\nhowever, this Court held that mandatory Guidelines ran\nafoul of the Sixth Amendment by allowing judges to find\nfacts that increased the penalty for a crime beyond \u201cthe\nmaximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of\nguilty or a jury verdict.\u201d See also Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The appropriate remedy for\nthis violation, the Court determined, was to strike those\nportions of the Sentencing Reform Act that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory. Booker, 543 U. S., at 245\u2013258.\nUnder the resulting scheme, a district court is still re-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Compare United States v.

See id., at 259\u2013260, 264;\n18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A). But the Guidelines are no\nlonger binding, and the district court must consider all of\nthe factors set forth in \u00a73553(a) to guide its discretion at\nsentencing, see Booker, 543 U. S., at 259\u2013260, 264. The\nBooker remedy, \u201cwhile not the system Congress enacted,\u201d\nwas designed to \u201ccontinue to move sentencing in Congress\u2019\npreferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing\ndisparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to indi-\nvidualize sentences where necessary.\u201d Id., at 264\u2013265.\n   Our subsequent decisions have clarified the role that\nthe Guidelines play in sentencing procedures, both at the\ndistrict court level and when sentences are reviewed on\nappeal. First, \u201ca district court should begin all sentencing\nproceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guide-\nlines range. As a matter of administration and to secure\nnationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the\nstarting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d Gall v. United\nStates, 552 U. S. 38, 49 (2007) (citation omitted). The\ndistrict court must then consider the arguments of the par-\nties and the factors set forth in \u00a73553(a). Id., at 49\u201350.\nThe district court \u201cmay not presume that the Guidelines\nrange is reasonable,\u201d id., at 50; and it \u201cmay in appropriate\ncases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on dis-\nagreement with the [Sentencing] Commission\u2019s views,\u201d Pep-\nper v. United States, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 23) (citing Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85,\n109\u2013110 (2007)). The district court must explain the basis\nfor its chosen sentence on the record. Gall, 552 U. S., at\n50. \u201c[A] major departure [from the Guidelines] should be\nsupported by a more significant justification than a minor\none.\u201d Ibid.\n   On appeal, the district court\u2019s sentence is reviewed for\nreasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee id., at 51; Booker, 543 U. S., at 261\u2013264. Failure to\ncalculate the correct Guidelines range constitutes proce-\n6                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ndural error, as does treating the Guidelines as mandatory.\nGall, 552 U. S., at 51. The court of appeals may, but is\nnot required to, presume that a within-Guidelines sentence\nis reasonable. Rita v. United States, 551 U. S. 338, 347\n(2007). The reviewing court may not apply a heightened\nstandard of review or a presumption of unreasonableness\nto sentences outside the Guidelines range, although it\n\u201cwill, of course, take into account the totality of the cir-\ncumstances, including the extent of any variance from the\nGuidelines range.\u201d Gall, 552 U. S., at 49\u201351. We have in-\ndicated that \u201ca district court\u2019s decision to vary from the\nadvisory Guidelines may attract greatest respect when\u201d it\nis based on the particular facts of a case. Kimbrough, 552\nU. S., at 109.2 Overall, this system \u201crequires a court to\ngive respectful consideration to the Guidelines,\u201d but it\n\u201cpermits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other\nstatutory concerns as well.\u201d Id., at 101 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   Under 18 U.

Whether the Ex Post Facto Clause was vio-\nlated by the use of the more onerous Guidelines in effect\non the date of Peugh\u2019s sentencing is the question pre-\nsented here.\n                            III\n                             A\n   The Constitution prohibits both federal and state gov-\nernments from enacting any \u201cex post facto Law.\u201d Art.

Texas, 529 U. S. 513, 521\u2013525 (2000)\n(discussing Calder v. Bull and the common-law under-\nstanding of the term). Building on Justice Chase\u2019s formu-\nlation of what constitutes an \u201cex post facto Law,\u201d our cases\n\u201chave not attempted to precisely delimit the scope of this\nLatin phrase, but have instead given it substance by an\naccretion of case law.\u201d Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282,\n292 (1977).\n  At issue here is Calder\u2019s third category of ex post facto\n8                    PEUGH v.

Peugh\u2019s claim is that\nthe Clause was violated because the 2009 Guidelines call\nfor a greater punishment than attached to bank fraud in\n2000, when his crimes were completed. The Government\ncounters that because the more punitive Guidelines ap-\nplied at Peugh\u2019s sentencing were only advisory, there was\nno ex post facto problem.\n   Each of the parties can point to prior decisions of this\nCourt that lend support to its view. On the one hand, we\nhave never accepted the proposition that a law must in-\ncrease the maximum sentence for which a defendant is\neligible in order to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See,\ne.g., Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397 (1937). More-\nover, the fact that the sentencing authority exercises some\nmeasure of discretion will also not defeat an ex post facto\nclaim. See Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 253 (2000). On\nthe other hand, we have made it clear that mere specula-\ntion or conjecture that a change in law will retrospectively\nincrease the punishment for a crime will not suffice to\nestablish a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nCalifornia Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499,\n509 (1995). The touchstone of this Court\u2019s inquiry is\nwhether a given change in law presents a \u201c \u2018sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner, 529 U. S., at 250 (quoting Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S., at 509). The question when a change in\nlaw creates such a risk is \u201ca matter of degree\u201d; the test\ncannot be reduced to a \u201csingle formula.\u201d Id., at 509 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE THOMAS, raising the issue on his own initiative, would reject\n\nour established Ex Post Facto Clause framework.

Florida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), in which this\nCourt considered an ex post facto challenge to a sentencing\nguidelines scheme implemented by the State of Florida.\nUnder Florida\u2019s system, a calculation under the guidelines\nyielded a presumptive sentencing range. Id., at 426. This\nrange was assumed to be appropriate, and the sentencing\njudge had discretion to fix a sentence within that range\n\u201c \u2018without the requirement of a written explanation.\u2019 \u201d\nIbid. (quoting Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.701(d)(8) (1983)).\nIf the court wished to depart from the guidelines range,\nhowever, it was required to give \u201cclear and convincing\nreasons in writing for doing so.\u201d 482 U. S., at 426. A\nwithin-guidelines sentence was unreviewable; a non-\nguidelines sentence was subject to appellate review. Ibid.\n   The petitioner in Miller had been sentenced under new\nguidelines that yielded a higher sentencing range than\nthe guidelines that had been in place at the time of his\ncrime, and he had received a sentence at the top of the new\nrange. Ibid. This Court found an ex post facto violation.\nWe emphasized that in order to impose the petitioner\u2019s\nsentence under the pre-existing guidelines, the sentenc-\ning judge would have been required to provide clear and\nconvincing reasons in writing for the departure, and the\nsentence would then have been reviewable on appeal. Id.,\nat 432. In contrast, because the sentence imposed was\nwithin the new guidelines range, it required no explana-\ntion and was unreviewable. Id., at 432\u2013433. The fact that\nFlorida\u2019s guidelines \u201ccreate[d] a high hurdle that must be\ncleared before discretion can be exercised\u201d was sufficient\nto render the changed guidelines an ex post facto law. Id.,\nat 435.\n   Miller thus establishes that applying amended sentenc-\ning guidelines that increase a defendant\u2019s recommended\n10                    PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nsentence can violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, notwith-\nstanding the fact that sentencing courts possess discretion\nto deviate from the recommended sentencing range. The\nsentencing scheme in Miller was designed to channel sen-\ntences for similarly situated offenders into a specified\nrange. Its reason-giving requirements and standards of\nappellate review meant that while variation was possible,\nit was burdensome; and so in the ordinary case, a defend-\nant would receive a within-guidelines sentence. Under the\nFlorida system, therefore, an increase in the guidelines\nrange applicable to an offender created a significant risk\nthat he would receive a higher sentence.4 The same prin-\nciples apply here.\n   The post-Booker federal sentencing scheme aims to\nachieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions\nare anchored by the Guidelines and that they remain a\nmeaningful benchmark through the process of appellate\nreview. See Kimbrough, 552 U. S., at 107. As we have\ndescribed, \u201cdistrict courts must begin their analysis with\nthe Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout\nthe sentencing process.\u201d Gall, 552 U. S., at 50, n. 6 (em-\nphasis added). Failing to calculate the correct Guidelines\nrange constitutes procedural error. Id., at 51. A district\ncourt contemplating a non-Guidelines sentence \u201cmust con-\nsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the\njustification is sufficiently compelling to support the de-\ngree of the variance.\u201d Id., at 50.

United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 5). Even if the sen-\ntencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, \u201cif\nthe judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point\nto explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guide-\nlines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.\u201d Ibid.\n(emphasis added). See also id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (stating that out-\nside the context of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\n11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, \u201cin the normal course the\ndistrict judge\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range appli-\ncable to the charged offenses will serve as the basis for the\nterm of imprisonment imposed\u201d). That a district court\nmay ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the\nGuidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force\nas the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that\nan incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error en-\nsures that they remain the starting point for every sen-\ntencing calculation in the federal system.\n   Similarly, appellate review for reasonableness using the\nGuidelines as a benchmark helps promote uniformity by\n\u201ctend[ing] to iron out sentencing differences.\u201d Booker, 543\nU.

S.,\nat 347, and they may further \u201cconsider the extent of the\ndeviation\u201d from the Guidelines as part of their reason-\nableness review, Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. As in Miller, then,\nthe post-Booker sentencing regime puts in place proce-\ndural \u201churdle[s]\u201d that, in practice, make the imposition of\na non-Guidelines sentence less likely. See 482 U. S., at 435.\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   This is a more difficult case than Miller, because there\nare relevant differences between Florida\u2019s sentencing\nscheme and the current federal sentencing regime. The\nFlorida Legislature had made a within-guidelines sen-\ntence unreviewable; whereas in the federal system, the\ncourts of appeals may\u2014but are not required to\u2014presume\nthat a within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable. And\nunder Florida\u2019s scheme, a sentencing court departing from\nthe guideline range was required to provide \u201cclear and\nconvincing\u201d reasons for the departure; whereas this Court\nhas not, post-Booker, applied such an exacting across-the-\nboard standard of review to variances. Rather, we have\nheld that a district court varying from the Federal Guide-\nlines should provide an explanation adequate to the extent\nof the departure. See Gall, 552 U. S., at 51.\n   But contrary to the arguments advanced by the Gov-\nernment and JUSTICE THOMAS\u2019 dissent (hereinafter dis-\nsent), see Brief for United States 23\u201324; post, at 5\u20136,\nthese differences are not dispositive. Although the federal\nsystem\u2019s procedural rules establish gentler checks on\nthe sentencing court\u2019s discretion than Florida\u2019s did, they\nnevertheless impose a series of requirements on sentenc-\ning courts that cabin the exercise of that discretion.\nCommon sense indicates that in general, this system will\nsteer district courts to more within-Guidelines sentences.\n   Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicat-\ning that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended\neffect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.\nEven after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines\nadvisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases\nimposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences\nthat depart downward from the Guidelines on the Gov-\nernment\u2019s motion. See United States Sentencing Commis-\nsion, 2011 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics,\np. 63 (Figure G) (16th ed.) (USSC).

See also Baron-Evans & Stith, Booker Rules,\n160 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1631, 1677 (2012). Moreover, the Sen-\ntencing Commission\u2019s data indicate that when a Guide-\nlines range moves up or down, offenders\u2019 sentences move\nwith it. See USSC, Final Quarterly Data Report, FY 2012,\np. 32 (Figure C); USSC, Report on the Continuing Impact\nof United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing, Pt. A,\npp. 60\u201368 (2012).5\n   The federal system adopts procedural measures intended\nto make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A\nretrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable\nto a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sen-\ntence to constitute an ex post facto violation.\n                             C\n  Our holding today is consistent with basic principles of\nfairness that animate the Ex Post Facto Clause. The\nFramers considered ex post facto laws to be \u201ccontrary to\nthe first principles of the social compact and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation.\u201d The Federalist No. 44,\np. 282 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The Clause\nensures that individuals have fair warning of applicable\nlaws and guards against vindictive legislative action. See\nWeaver v. Graham, 450 U. S. 24, 28\u201329 (1981); see also\npost, at 11\u201313. Even where these concerns are not directly\nimplicated, however, the Clause also safeguards \u201ca fun-\ndamental fairness interest . . . in having the government\nabide by the rules of law it establishes to govern the cir-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The Government does not dispute these statistics. It argues instead\n\nthat by relying on aggregated data, Peugh glosses over the fact that\nnon-Guidelines sentences are more common for certain crimes and that\nsome individual judges are less likely to follow the Guidelines than\nothers. Brief for United States 49\u201350. But these arguments do not\nrefute the basic point that the applicable Guidelines channel sentences\ntoward the specified range, even if they do not fix them within it.\n14               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                   Opinion of SOTOMAYOR, J.\n\ncumstances under which it can deprive a person of his or\nher liberty or life.\u201d Carmell, 529 U. S., at 533.\n   The Sentencing Guidelines represent the Federal Gov-\nernment\u2019s authoritative view of the appropriate sentences\nfor specific crimes. When Peugh committed his crime,\nthe recommended sentence was 30 to 37 months. When he\nwas sentenced, it was 70 to 87 months. \u201c[T]he purpose\nand effect of the change in [the Guidelines calculation]\nwas to increase the rates and length of incarceration for\n[fraud].\u201d Miller, 482 U. S., at 431 (citing Florida Bar:\nAmendment to Rules of Criminal Procedure (3.701, 3.988\u2014\nSentencing Guidelines), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 824, n. (1984) ( per\ncuriam) (internal quotation marks and alterations omit-\nted)). Such a retrospective increase in the measure of\npunishment raises clear ex post facto concerns. We have\npreviously recognized, for instance, that a defendant\ncharged with an increased punishment for his crime is\nlikely to feel enhanced pressure to plead guilty. See\nCarmell, 529 U. S., at 534, n. 24; Weaver, 450 U. S., at\n32. This pressure does not disappear simply because the\nGuidelines range is advisory; the defendant will be aware\nthat the range is intended to, and usually does, exert\ncontrolling influence on the sentence that the court will\nimpose.\n   We are therefore not persuaded by the argument ad-\nvanced by the Government and also suggested by the\ndissent that the animating principles of the Ex Post Facto\nClause are not implicated by this case. While the Gov-\nernment argues that the Sentencing Commission is insu-\nlated from legislative interference, see Brief for United\nStates 42\u201344, our precedents make clear that the coverage\nof the Ex Post Facto Clause is not limited to legislative\nacts, see Garner, 529 U. S., at 247, 257 (recognizing that a\nchange in a parole board\u2019s rules could, given an adequate\nshowing, run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause). It is true\nthat we held, in Irizarry v. United States, 553 U. S. 708,\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n713\u2013714 (2008), that a defendant does not have an \u201cexpec-\ntation subject to due process protection\u201d that he will be\nsentenced within the Guidelines range. But, contrary to\nthe dissent\u2019s view, see post, at 11\u201313, the Ex Post Facto\nClause does not merely protect reliance interests. It also\nreflects principles of \u201cfundamental justice.\u201d Carmell, 529\nU. S., at 531.6\n                              IV\n   The Government\u2019s principal argument that there is no\nconstitutional violation in this case is that the Sentencing\nGuidelines lack sufficient legal effect to attain the sta-\ntus of a \u201claw\u201d within the meaning of the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Whereas the pre-Booker Guidelines \u201cha[d] the force\nand effect of laws,\u201d Booker, 543 U. S., at 234, the post-\nBooker Guidelines, the Government contends, have lost that\nstatus due to their advisory nature. The dissent echoes\nthis argument. Post, at 1\u20133, 6\u20138.\n   The distinction that the Government draws is necessar-\nily a fine one, because our precedents firmly establish that\nchanges in law need not bind a sentencing authority in\norder to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, for example,\na law can run afoul of the Clause even if it does not alter\nthe statutory maximum punishment attached to a crime.\nIn Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U. S. 397, this Court con-\nsidered an ex post facto challenge to a Washington law\naltering the statutory penalty for grand larceny from a\nrange of 0 to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment to a mandatory term\nof 15 years\u2019 imprisonment. Although the upper boundary\nof the sentencing court\u2019s power to punish remained un-\nchanged, it was enough that the petitioners were \u201cde-\nprived of all opportunity to receive a sentence which would\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Ofcourse, \u201cwhile the principle of unfairness helps explain and shape\nthe Clause\u2019s scope, it is not a doctrine unto itself, invalidating laws\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause by its own force.\u201d Carmell, 529 U. S., at\n533, n. 23.\n16               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ngive them freedom from custody and control prior to the\nexpiration of the 15-year term.\u201d Id., at 402 (emphasis\nadded).\n   In addition, our cases make clear that \u201c[t]he presence of\ndiscretion does not displace the protections of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause.\u201d Garner, 529 U. S., at 253. In a series of\ncases, for example, this Court has considered the validity\nunder the Ex Post Facto Clause of state laws altering the\nterms on which discretionary parole or early release was\navailable to prisoners. See Garner, 529 U. S. 244; Mo-\nrales, 514 U. S. 499; Weaver, 450 U. S. 24. Although these\ncases reached differing conclusions with respect to whether\nthere was an ex post facto violation, in none of them did\nwe indicate that the mere fact that the prisoner was not\nguaranteed parole but rather received it at the will of the\nparole board was fatal to his claim. See Garner, 529 U. S.,\nat 253; Morales, 514 U. S., at 508\u2013510, and n. 6; Weaver,\n450 U. S., at 30\u201331.\n   The Government does not challenge these holdings but\nrather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much\nlike guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise\nto an ex post facto violation. It contrasts the Sentenc-\ning Guidelines with the Florida system at issue in Miller,\nwhich, the Government indicates, really did place \u201ca sub-\nstantial legislative constraint on the judge\u2019s exercise of\nsentencing discretion.\u201d Brief for United States 21. But as\nwe have explained at length, the difference between the\nfederal system and the scheme the Court considered in\nMiller is one in degree, not in kind. The Florida system\ndid not achieve its \u201cbinding legal effect,\u201d Brief for United\nStates 22, by mandating a within-guidelines sentence in\nevery case. Rather, it achieved its \u201cbinding legal effect\u201d\nthrough a set of procedural rules and standards for appel-\nlate review that, in combination, encouraged district\ncourts to sentence within the guidelines. See Miller, 482\nU. S., at 432\u2013433. We have detailed all of the ways in\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhich the federal sentencing regime after Booker does the\nsame.7\n   The Government elaborates its argument that the Sen-\ntencing Guidelines do not have adequate legal force to\nconstitute an ex post facto violation by reviewing the vari-\nous features of the post-Booker sentencing regime that, in\nits view, tend to render the Guidelines purely advisory.\nAs we have noted, district courts may not presume that\na within-Guidelines sentence is reasonable; they may \u201cin\nappropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based\non a disagreement with the Commission\u2019s views,\u201d Pepper,\n562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 23); and all sentences are\nreviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136.\n   While the Government accurately describes several\nattributes of federal sentencing after Booker, the conclu-\nsion it draws by isolating these features of the system is\nultimately not supportable. On the Government\u2019s account,\nthe Guidelines are just one among many persuasive\nsources a sentencing court can consult, no different from\na \u201cpolicy paper.\u201d Brief for United States 28. The Govern-\nment\u2019s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that\ndistrict courts are not required to consult any policy paper\nin order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must\nthey \u201cconsider the extent of [their] deviation\u201d from a given\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The Government likens the Sentencing Guidelines system to the\n\nParole Commission\u2019s Parole Release Guidelines, which established an\nadvisory framework for parole decisions, see United States Parole\nComm\u2019n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S. 388, 391 (1980), and argues that Miller\nindicated that retrospectively applying more stringent parole guidelines\nwould not have constituted an ex post facto violation. The issue of\nthe constitutional validity of the retrospective application of the parole\nguidelines, however, was not before the Court in Miller. While the\nMiller Court did state that lower court cases discussing the federal\nparole guidelines were \u201cinapposite\u201d to its discussion of the Florida\nguidelines, 482 U. S., at 434\u2013435, it had no occasion to address whether\nchanges to the parole guidelines generated an ex post facto problem.\n18               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npolicy paper and \u201censure that the justification is suffi-\nciently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\u201d\nGall, 552 U. S., at 50. Courts of appeals, in turn, are not\npermitted to presume that a sentence that comports with\na particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of\nappeals, in considering whether the district court\u2019s sen-\ntence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure\nfrom a given policy paper in determining whether the\ndistrict court abused its discretion, see id., at 51. It is\nsimply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are\nmerely a volume that the district court reads with aca-\ndemic interest in the course of sentencing.\n    Of course, as the Government and the dissent point out,\nnotwithstanding a rule that retrospective application of a\nhigher Guidelines range violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nsentencing courts will be free to give careful consideration\nto the current version of the Guidelines as representing\nthe most recent views of the agency charged by Congress\nwith developing sentencing policy. See post, at 8 (citing\nDemaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795). But this does not render our\nholding \u201cpurely semantic.\u201d Id., at 795. District courts\nmust begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines\nin effect at the time of the offense and use them to calcu-\nlate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines\nwill anchor both the district court\u2019s discretion and the\nappellate review process in all of the ways we have de-\nscribed. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the\nstatus of one of many reasons a district court might give\nfor deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is\nsimply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.\n     Finally, the Government contends that a rule that the\nEx Post Facto Clause is violated by the application of an\nincreased Guidelines range would be in tension with this\nCourt\u2019s post-Booker cases and, indeed, would \u201clargely undo\n. . . the Booker remedy\u201d for the Sixth Amendment violation\nfound there. Brief for United States 35. If the Guidelines\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nare binding enough to trigger an ex post facto violation, the\nargument goes, then they must be binding enough to\ntrigger a Sixth Amendment violation as well. The Gov-\nernment\u2019s argument assumes that the Sixth Amendment\nand the Ex Post Facto Clause share a common boundary;\nthat only where judge-found facts are the basis of a higher\nsentence in a manner that raises Sixth Amendment con-\ncerns can a set of sentencing rules be sufficiently determi-\nnate to run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clause. But the\nSixth Amendment and Ex Post Facto Clause inquiries are\nanalytically distinct. Our Sixth Amendment cases have\nfocused on when a given finding of fact is required to make\na defendant legally eligible for a more severe penalty. Our\nex post facto cases, in contrast, have focused on whether a\nchange in law creates a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of a higher sen-\ntence; here, whether a sentence in conformity with the\nnew Guidelines is substantially likely. The Booker remedy\nwas designed, and has been subsequently calibrated, to\nexploit precisely this distinction: it is intended to promote\nsentencing uniformity while avoiding a Sixth Amendment\nviolation. In light of the statistics invoked by petitioner,\nsee supra, at 12\u201313, it appears so far to be achieving this\nbalance. Nothing that we say today \u201cundo[es]\u201d the hold-\nings of Booker, Rita, Gall, Kimbrough, or our other recent\nsentencing cases.\n                        *    *    *\n   The arguments put forward by the Government and the\ndissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh\u2019s case\nfalls within Calder\u2019s third category of ex post facto viola-\ntions. \u201c[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [govern-\nment] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering\nthe substantive \u2018formula\u2019 used to calculate the applicable\nsentencing range.\u201d Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is\nprecisely what the amended Guidelines did here. Doing so\n20                  PEUGH v.

In such a case, the ex post facto error may be harmless. See\nChapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967). Here, however, the Gov-\nernment does not argue that any ex post facto violation was harmless.\nAnd indeed, any such argument would fail in light of the fact that the\nDistrict Court rejected Peugh\u2019s ex post facto claim in keeping with\nCircuit precedent, applied the new Guidelines, and indicated at sen-\ntencing that \u201ca sentence within the [G]uideline range is the most\nappropriate sentence in this case.\u201d App. 30, 100.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

Under our precedents, the relevant\ninquiry for determining whether a law \u201cinflicts a greater\npunishment,\u201d is whether the \u201cretroactive application of\nthe change in [the] law created \u2018a sufficient risk of increas-\ning the measure of punishment attached to the covered\ncrimes.\u2019 \u201d Garner v. Jones, 529 U. S. 244, 250 (2000) (quot-\ning California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S.\n499, 509 (1995)).

UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nsons. First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion\nof district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a de-\nfendant\u2019s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended\nGuidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive\na harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guide-\nlines\u2019 persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guide-\nlines help district judges to impose sentences that comply\nwith \u00a73553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in\nessence, the risk of a more accurate sentence\u2014i.e., a sen-\ntence more in line with the statutory scheme\u2019s penological\ngoals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve\nsuch pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create\na risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex\nPost Facto Clause. We have never held that government\naction violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it merely\ninfluences the exercise of the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion.\n                              A\n   The Federal Sentencing Guidelines do not constrain the\ndiscretion of district courts.

Id., at 47; id., at 41\n(\u201c[C]ourts of appeals must review all sentences\u2014whether\ninside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines\nrange\u2014under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d).\nWhile \u201c[t]he applicable guideline [may] nudg[e] [the sen-\ntencing judge] toward the sentencing range,\u201d \u201chis freedom\nto impose a reasonable sentence outside the range is un-\nfettered.\u201d United States v. Demaree, 459 F. 3d 791, 795\n(CA7 2006).\n   None of petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary is per-\nsuasive. Petitioner first contends that the Guidelines\nconstrain district courts\u2019 discretion because improperly\ncalculating the applicable guidelines is reversible error.\nBrief for Petitioner 20\u201321, and n. 7; 18 U. S. C. \u00a73742(f);\nCf. Gall, 552 U. S., at 51. This argument is a non sequi-\ntur. The Guidelines can only serve their advisory purpose\nif district courts consider the \u201crange established\u201d by the\n4                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nGuidelines, \u00a73553(a)(4). For this reason, district courts\nmust \u201cbegin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calcu-\nlating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d Id., at 49. But\nthe fact that courts must give due consideration to the\nrecommendation expressed in the correct Guidelines does\nnot mean that the Guidelines constrain the district court\u2019s\ndiscretion to impose an appropriate sentence; it simply\nmeans that district courts must consider the correct vari-\nables before exercising their discretion.\n   Petitioner next argues that the Guidelines limit district\ncourt discretion because sentences falling outside the\nGuidelines are more likely to be reversed for substantive\nunreasonableness. Brief for Petitioner 25. I doubt, how-\never, that reversal is a likely outcome when a district\njudge can justify his sentence based on agreement with\neither of two Guidelines\u2014the old or the new. If a dis-\ntrict court calculated the sentencing range under the\nnew Guidelines but sentenced the defendant to a below-\nGuidelines sentence that fell within the range provided\nby the old Guidelines, it would be difficult to label such\na sentence \u201csubstantively unreasonable.\u201d To do so would\ncast doubt on every within-Guidelines sentence issued un-\nder the old Guidelines. Similarly, it is hard to imagine\nthat a court of appeals would reverse a sentence for sub-\nstantive unreasonableness if it was above the range of the\nGuidelines in effect at the time of the offense but fell\nwithin the range of the most up-to-date Guidelines. This\ncase provides an apt example. After considering all of\nthe \u00a73553(a)(2) factors, the District Court concluded that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines range was \u201cthe\nmost appropriate sentence in this case.\u201d App. 100. The\nsame sentence would undoubtedly be upheld on appeal if\nthe District Court, on remand, once again determined that\na sentence within the amended Guidelines was appropri-\nate in light of all the facts. The essential point is that once\nnew Guidelines have been promulgated, reasonableness\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nreview does not meaningfully constrain the discretion of\ndistrict courts to sentence offenders within either of the\ntwo ranges.\n  The majority argues that our opinion in Miller v. Flor-\nida, 482 U. S. 423 (1987), supports its conclusion that\nretroactive application of advisory Guidelines violates the\nEx Post Facto Clause. See ante, at 9\u201310. But Miller leads\nto the opposite conclusion. There, Florida superimposed\nnarrowed presumptive sentencing ranges on the statutory\nsentencing ranges for particular crimes. 482 U. S., at\n425\u2013426. If a judge imposed a sentence within that nar-\nrower presumptive range, he did not need to give a written\nexplanation of his reasons for selecting that sentence, and\nthe sentence was not subject to appellate review. Ibid. If\nthe judge imposed a sentence outside the presumptive\nrange, however, he was required to provide \u201c \u2018clear and\nconvincing reasons,\u2019 \u201d id., at 426 (quoting Fla. Rule Crim.\nProc. 3.701(d)(11) (1983)), based \u201con facts proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt,\u201d that justified the departure, 482 U. S.,\nat 432. In concluding that retroactive application of this\nscheme violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, we reasoned\nthat the Florida guidelines did not \u201csimply provide flexible\n\u2018guideposts\u2019 for use in the exercise of discretion: instead,\nthey create[d] a high hurdle that must be cleared before\ndiscretion c[ould] be exercised.\u201d Id., at 435.\n  The Court cites Miller for the proposition \u201cthat applying\namended sentencing guidelines that increase a defend-\nant\u2019s recommended sentence can violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause, notwithstanding the fact that sentencing courts\npossess discretion to deviate from the recommended sen-\ntencing range.\u201d Ante, at 10. But that claim is not sup-\nported by Miller. The guidelines in Miller violated the Ex\nPost Facto Clause precisely because they constrained the\nsentencing judge\u2019s discretion.\n  The Federal Guidelines, by contrast, do no such thing.\nIndeed, our post-Booker opinions have made abundantly\n6                PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that the Guidelines do not create a \u201chigh hurdle\u201d\u2014\nor any hurdle at all\u2014\u201cthat must be cleared before discre-\ntion can be exercised.\u201d Miller, 482 U. S., at 435. Rather,\nthe Guidelines are \u201cflexible \u2018guideposts\u2019 \u201d which inform the\ndistrict courts\u2019 discretion. Ibid. Accordingly, their retro-\nactive application cannot constitute a violation of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause.\n                               B\n  Notwithstanding the discretion district courts have to\nimpose appropriate sentences anywhere within the statu-\ntory range, Guidelines do \u201cinfluenc[e] the sentences im-\nposed by judges.\u201d Ante, at 12. But, the Guidelines do this\nby helping district courts impose sentences that are con-\nsistent with \u00a73553(a). It is difficult to see how an advi-\nsory Guideline, designed to lead courts to impose sentences\nmore in line with fixed statutory objectives, could ever\nconstitute an ex post facto violation. But that is exactly\nwhat the Court concludes.\n  District courts are charged with imposing sentences that\nare \u201c \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to comply\nwith the sentencing purposes set forth in\u201d \u00a73553(a). Pep-\nper, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting \u00a73553(a)).\nThe district court\u2019s task is to impose sentences that reflect\nthe punitive goals of justice, deterrence, protection of the\npublic, and rehabilitation. 18 U. S. C. \u00a73553(a)(2). While\neasily stated, this goal is difficult to achieve. Enter the\nSentencing Guidelines.\n  The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 instructs the Sen-\ntencing Commission to promulgate Guidelines that reflect\nthe \u201csame basic \u00a73553(a) objectives\u201d that district courts\nmust consider. Rita, 551 U. S., at 348; see also 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a7991(b)(1)(A). In crafting the Guidelines, the Commission\nbegan with \u201can empirical examination of 10,000 presen-\ntence reports setting forth what judges had done in the\npast.\u201d Rita, supra, at 349 (citing United States Sentencing\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

The Commission then \u201cmodif[ied]\nand adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of greater\nrationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with con-\ngressional instructions, and the like.\u201d Rita, supra, at 349.\nWhile an individual judge has limited experience upon\nwhich to draw, the Commission \u201chas the capacity . . . to\nbase its determinations on empirical data and national\nexperience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate\nexpertise.\u201d Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U. S. 85, 109\n(2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Com-\nmission updates the Guidelines regularly as new infor-\nmation becomes available. It consults with \u201cprosecutors,\ndefenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associa-\ntions, experts in penology, and others,\u201d to ensure that the\nGuidelines continue to further \u00a73553(a)\u2019s goals. Rita,\nsupra, at 350; see also Booker, 543 U. S., at 263 (noting\nthat the Commission would \u201cmodify its Guidelines in light\nof what it learns, thereby encouraging what it finds to be\nbetter sentencing practices\u201d).\n   In light of this extensive study, amendments to the\nGuidelines should produce sentencing ranges that better\ncomport with the \u00a73553(a) factors. If the Commission has\nfulfilled its mission of recommending sentences that are\ngenerally consistent with \u00a73553(a)(2), then sentences\nshould fall within the Guidelines range most of the time.\nThis, in part, explains why within-Guidelines sentences\nare presumed, on appeal, to reflect a \u201cdiscretionary deci-\nsion\u201d by the district court that \u201caccords with the Commis-\nsion\u2019s view.\u201d Rita, supra, at 351.\n   Again, this case furnishes a ready example. Prior to pe-\ntitioner\u2019s sentencing, Congress directed the Commission\n\u201cto consider\u201d whether fraud guidelines were \u201c \u2018sufficient to\ndeter and punish\u2019 \u201d particular offenses, in light of increases\nto statutory maximum penalties for certain fraud crimes\nother than bank fraud. USSG App. C, Amdt. 653 (Reason\n8                 PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nfor Amendment) (effective Nov. 1, 2003) (quoting White-\nCollar Crime Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002,\n\u00a7905(b)(2), 116 Stat. 805). This produced amended Guide-\nlines, which were based on the Commission\u2019s further\nassessment of \u201ceconomic crime issues over a number of\nyears.\u201d USSG App. C, Amdt. 617 (Reason for Amendment)\n(effective Nov. 1, 2001). With an amended Guidelines\nsentencing range, the District Court concluded that a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence was \u201cthe most appropriate\nsentence.\u201d App. 100. Neither the statutory sentencing\nrange nor \u00a73553(a) changed between the time of petition-\ner\u2019s offense and sentencing. Thus, it is quite incorrect to\nsay that reliance on information reflected in the amended\nGuidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n   This is underscored by the fact that even the Court\u2019s\nholding\u2014which requires district courts to calculate the\nGuidelines range in effect at the time of the offense\u2014will\nnot eliminate the \u201crisk\u201d of a higher sentence. The district\njudge remains free to consider the range produced by the\namended Guidelines. See Demaree, 459 F. 3d, at 795 (\u201cA\njudge is certainly entitled to take advice from the Sentenc-\ning Commission\u201d). Thus, the mere fact that new Guide-\nlines have been promulgated creates some risk of an\nincreased sentence, even if district courts are required to\ncalculate the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense.\nPetitioner has presented no evidence indicating what\nportion of the risk of an increased sentence flows from the\nretroactive application of the amended Guidelines and\nwhat portion flows from their very existence. In the ab-\nsence of such evidence, even if I agreed that advisory\nGuidelines could be ex post facto laws, which I do not,\nI would not find the \u201crisk\u201d of an increased sentence created\nby the retroactive application of the Guidelines to be \u201csuf-\nficient\u201d for ex post facto purposes.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)              9\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                                 II\n    Today\u2019s opinion also demonstrates the unworkability of\nour ex post facto jurisprudence. Under our current prece-\ndent, whenever a change in the law creates a \u201crisk\u201d of an\nincreased sentence, we must determine whether the risk is\n\u201csufficient,\u201d see Morales, 514 U. S., at 509, or sufficiently\n\u201c \u2018significant,\u2019 \u201d see ante, at 19, to violate the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Our analysis under that test has devolved into\nlittle more than an exercise in judicial intuition. I would\nreturn to the original meaning of the Clause as stated in\nJustice Chase\u2019s classic Calder formulation, under which\nlaws of this sort are ex post facto only when they retro-\nactively increase the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201d\n3 Dall., at 390.\n                             A\n   This Court addressed the Ex Post Facto Clause a mere\ndecade after the Constitution was ratified. In Calder,\nJustice Chase described four types of ex post facto laws. 3\nDall., at 390. As relevant, Justice Chase\u2019s third category\nindicated that \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment,\nand inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed\nto the crime, when committed\u201d violates the Ex Post Facto\nClause. Ibid. Justice Chase\u2019s emphasis on increases\nin the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime\u201d was grounded\nin the English common law and accurately reflected the\noriginal understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause. See\nPart II\u2013B, infra. Unfortunately, the Court rapidly deviated\nfrom this formulation. In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S.\n221 (1883), the Court declared that \u201cany law passed after\nthe commission of an offence which . . . \u2018in relation to that\noffence, or its consequences, alters the situation of a party\nto his disadvantage,\u2019 is an ex post facto law.\u201d Id., at 235\n(quoting Justice Washington\u2019s jury charge in United States\nv.

Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,\n49 (1990) (overruling Kring).\n   Following Collins\u2019 disavowal of Kring, the Court held\nthat a law is ex post facto if it \u201cproduces a sufficient risk\nof increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\ncovered crimes.\u201d Morales, supra, at 509. While Morales\navoided the over-breadth of Kring\u2019s \u201cdisadvantage the de-\nfendant\u201d test, it failed to reconnect our ex post facto ju-\nrisprudence to the original understanding of the term.\uf02a\nThe \u201csufficient risk\u201d test also depends upon empirical\nanalysis that cannot yield determinative answers and\nwhich courts are ill equipped to handle. See, e.g., Gar-\nner, 529 U. S., at 255 (\u201cWhen the rule does not by its\nown terms show a significant risk, the respondent must\ndemonstrate, by evidence drawn from the rule\u2019s practical\nimplementation by the agency charged with exercising\ndiscretion, that its retroactive application will result in\na longer period of incarceration than under the earlier\nrule\u201d). More fundamentally, the \u201csufficient risk\u201d test, like\nthe \u201cdisadvantage the defendant\u201d test, wrongly focuses on\nthe particular sentence that the defendant might receive,\nrather than on the punishment \u201cannexed to the crime.\u201d\n   The practical difficulties with the test are apparent even\nfrom our application in Morales, where we considered an\namendment to California\u2019s parole procedures that allowed,\nunder certain circumstances, the Board of Prison Terms to\ndecrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings.\nUnder the sufficient risk test, we were compelled to specu-\nlate about the possible effects of the new law on various\nindividuals\u2019 prison terms.

But nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post\nFacto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expecta-\ntions that prisoners and defendants have about how many\ndays they will spend in prison.\n                              B\n   \u201cAlthough the Latin phrase \u2018ex post facto\u2019 literally en-\ncompasses any law passed \u2018after the fact,\u2019 \u201d Collins, 497\nU. S., at 41, the Court has long recognized that the phrase\n\u201cwas a term of art with an established meaning\u201d at the\ntime of the founding. Ibid. Blackstone offers the first key\nto understanding this \u201cestablished meaning.\u201d He explic-\nitly opposed laws that rendered innocent conduct crimi-\nnal after the fact. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *44\n(hereinafter Blackstone). Such laws deprive citizens of\nnotice and fair warning and are, therefore, an affront to\nman\u2019s \u201creason and freewill.\u201d Id., at *39; see id., at *46.\nBlackstone, thus, considered them illegitimate. Id., at\n*44; see also The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed.\n1961) (J. Madison) (\u201c[E]x post facto laws . . . are contrary\nto the first principles of the social compact, and to every\nprinciple of sound legislation\u201d). For this reason, ex post\nfacto laws have rightly been described as \u201cformidable\ninstruments of tyranny,\u201d id., No. 84, at 577 (A. Hamilton),\nand their prohibition a \u201cbulwark in favour of the personal\nsecurity of the subject,\u201d Calder, supra, at 390 (opinion of\nChase, J.).\n   Although Blackstone confined his discussion of ex post\nfacto laws to those laws retroactively declaring innocent\nacts to be criminal, other authorities confirm that laws\nretroactively increasing the punishment were also under-\nstood to be ex post facto at the time of the founding. See,\n12               PEUGH v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ne.g., 2 R.

Justice Chase\u2019s formulation re-\nflects this understanding. Calder, 3 Dall., at 390 (\u201cEvery\nlaw that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater\npunishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\ncommitted\u201d is ex post facto). Under this view, courts must\ncompare the punishment affixed to the crime at the time\nof the offense with the punishment affixed at the time of\nsentencing. If the latter is harsher than the former, the\ncourt must apply the punishment in effect at the time of\nthe offense.\n   At common law, it was quite easy to identify when a law\nretroactively increased the punishment, because the crim-\ninal law generally \u201cprescribed a particular sentence for\neach offense.\u201d Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury\non the Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700\u20131900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987). In a world of determinate sentencing, a retro-\nactive increase in the punishment affixed to a crime rend-\ners an act \u201cpunishable in a manner in which it was not\npunishable when it was committed,\u201d Fletcher v. Peck, 6\nCranch 87, 138 (1810), which is sufficient for an ex post\nfacto violation.

Because\nincreasing the punishment affixed to the crime deprives\npeople of the opportunity to plan their conduct in light of\nthe law, \u201c[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems\nto come within the same mischief as the creation of a\ncrime or penalty; and therefore they may be classed to-\ngether.\u201d Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).\n   Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a de-\nfendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not\nimplicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual\ncontemplating the commission of a given offense knows he\nmay be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed\nrange. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he\nmay even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But\nhe does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U.

The law\nprovides the defendant with only one assurance: He will\nbe sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by\nstatute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a par-\nticular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not\ndeprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the\nconcerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.\n                            C\n  The statutory range in effect at the time of petitioner\u2019s\noffense remained in effect at his sentencing.

I do not have occasion in this case to reconsider\nthat test\u2019s merits or its relation to the original under-\nstanding of the Clause.\n</pre>",
