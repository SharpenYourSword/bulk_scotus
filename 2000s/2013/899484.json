SUTTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 12\u2013135.      Argued March 25, 2013\u2014Decided June 10, 2013\nRespondent Sutter, a pediatrician, provided medical services to peti-\n  tioner Oxford Health Plans\u2019 insureds under a fee-for-services contract\n  that required binding arbitration of contractual disputes. He none-\n  theless filed a proposed class action in New Jersey Superior Court, al-\n  leging that Oxford failed to fully and promptly pay him and other\n  physicians with similar Oxford contracts. On Oxford\u2019s motion, the\n  court compelled arbitration. The parties agreed that the arbitrator\n  should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration,\n  and he concluded that it did. Oxford filed a motion in federal court to\n  vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision, claiming that he had \u201cexceeded [his]\n  powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\n  U. S. C. \u00a71 et. seq. The District Court denied the motion, and the\n  Third Circuit affirmed.\n     After this Court decided Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l\n  Corp., 559 U. S. 662\u2014holding that an arbitrator may employ class\n  procedures only if the parties have authorized them\u2014the arbitrator\n  reaffirmed his conclusion that the contract approves class arbitration.\n  Oxford renewed its motion to vacate that decision under \u00a710(a)(4).\n  The District Court denied the motion, and the Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The arbitrator\u2019s decision survives the limited judicial review al-\n lowed by \u00a710(a)(4). Pp. 4\u22129.\n    (a) A party seeking relief under \u00a710(a)(4) bears a heavy burden. \u201cIt\n is not enough . . . to show that the [arbitrator] committed an error\u2014\n or even a serious error.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S., at 671. Because the\n parties \u201cbargained for the arbitrator\u2019s construction of their agree-\n ment,\u201d an arbitral decision \u201ceven arguably construing or applying the\n contract\u201d must stand, regardless of a court\u2019s view of its (de)merits.\n Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62.\n2              OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Thus, the sole question on judicial review is whether the arbitrator\n    interpreted the parties\u2019 contract, not whether he construed it correct-\n    ly. Here, the arbitrator twice did what the parties asked: He consid-\n    ered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to\n    permit class proceedings. That suffices to show that he did not ex-\n    ceed his powers under \u00a710(a)(4). Pp. 4\u22126.\n       (b) Stolt-Neilsen does not support Oxford\u2019s contrary view. There,\n    the parties stipulated that they had not reached an agreement on\n    class arbitration, so the arbitrators did not construe the contract, and\n    did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings. This\n    Court thus found not that they had misinterpreted the contract but\n    that they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, in stark con-\n    trast, the arbitrator did construe the contract, and did find an\n    agreement to permit class arbitration. So to overturn his decision,\n    this Court would have to find that he misapprehended the parties\u2019 in-\n    tent. But \u00a710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an\n    arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated\n    task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task\n    poorly. Oxford\u2019s remaining arguments go to the merits of the arbitra-\n    tor\u2019s contract interpretation and are thus irrelevant under \u00a710(a)(4).\n    Pp. 6\u22129.\n675 F. 3d 215, affirmed.\n\n   KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

See Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds\nInt\u2019l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 684 (2010). In this case, an\narbitrator found that the parties\u2019 contract provided for\nclass arbitration. The question presented is whether in\ndoing so he \u201cexceeded [his] powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.\nWe conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s decision survives the\nlimited judicial review \u00a710(a)(4) allows.\n                              I\n  Respondent John Sutter, a pediatrician, entered into a\ncontract with petitioner Oxford Health Plans, a health in-\nsurance company. Sutter agreed to provide medical care\nto members of Oxford\u2019s network, and Oxford agreed to pay\nfor those services at prescribed rates. Several years later,\nSutter filed suit against Oxford in New Jersey Superior\nCourt on behalf of himself and a proposed class of other\nNew Jersey physicians under contract with Oxford. The\ncomplaint alleged that Oxford had failed to make full and\n2          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nprompt payment to the doctors, in violation of their agree-\nments and various state laws.\n  Oxford moved to compel arbitration of Sutter\u2019s claims,\nrelying on the following clause in their contract:\n    \u201cNo civil action concerning any dispute arising under\n    this Agreement shall be instituted before any court,\n    and all such disputes shall be submitted to final and\n    binding arbitration in New Jersey, pursuant to the\n    rules of the American Arbitration Association with\n    one arbitrator.\u201d App. 15\u201316.\nThe state court granted Oxford\u2019s motion, thus referring\nthe suit to arbitration.\n   The parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide\nwhether their contract authorized class arbitration, and\nhe determined that it did. Noting that the question\nturned on \u201cconstruction of the parties\u2019 agreement,\u201d the\narbitrator focused on the text of the arbitration clause\nquoted above. Id., at 30. He reasoned that the clause sent\nto arbitration \u201cthe same universal class of disputes\u201d that it\nbarred the parties from bringing \u201cas civil actions\u201d in court:\nThe \u201cintent of the clause\u201d was \u201cto vest in the arbitration\nprocess everything that is prohibited from the court pro-\ncess.\u201d Id., at 31. And a class action, the arbitrator contin-\nued, \u201cis plainly one of the possible forms of civil action that\ncould be brought in a court\u201d absent the agreement. Ibid.\nAccordingly, he concluded that \u201con its face, the arbitration\nclause . . . expresses the parties\u2019 intent that class arbitra-\ntion can be maintained.\u201d Id., at 32.\n   Oxford filed a motion in federal court to vacate the\narbitrator\u2019s decision on the ground that he had \u201cexceeded\n[his] powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the FAA. The District\nCourt denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals for\nthe Third Circuit affirmed. See 05\u2013CV\u20132198, 2005 WL\n6795061 (D NJ, Oct. 31, 2005), aff \u2019d, 227 Fed. Appx. 135\n(2007).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  While the arbitration proceeded, this Court held in\nStolt-Nielsen that \u201ca party may not be compelled under\nthe FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a\ncontractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to\ndo so.\u201d 559 U. S., at 684. The parties in Stolt-Nielsen\nhad stipulated that they had never reached an agreement\non class arbitration. Relying on \u00a710(a)(4), we vacated the\narbitrators\u2019 decision approving class proceedings because,\nin the absence of such an agreement, the arbitrators had\n\u201csimply . . . imposed [their] own view of sound policy.\u201d Id.,\nat 672.\n  Oxford immediately asked the arbitrator to reconsider\nhis decision on class arbitration in light of Stolt-Nielsen.\nThe arbitrator issued a new opinion holding that Stolt-\nNielsen had no effect on the case because this agreement\nauthorized class arbitration. Unlike in Stolt-Nielsen, the\narbitrator explained, the parties here disputed the mean-\ning of their contract; he had therefore been required \u201cto\nconstrue the arbitration clause in the ordinary way to\nglean the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d App. 72. And in performing\nthat task, the arbitrator continued, he had \u201cfound that\nthe arbitration clause unambiguously evinced an intention\nto allow class arbitration.\u201d Id., at 70. The arbitrator con-\ncluded by reconfirming his reasons for so construing the\nclause.\n  Oxford then returned to federal court, renewing its\neffort to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision under \u00a710(a)(4).\nOnce again, the District Court denied the motion, and the\nThird Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals first under-\nscored the limited scope of judicial review that \u00a710(a)(4)\nallows: So long as an arbitrator \u201cmakes a good faith at-\ntempt\u201d to interpret a contract, \u201ceven serious errors of law\nor fact will not subject his award to vacatur.\u201d 675 F. 3d\n215, 220 (2012). Oxford could not prevail under that\nstandard, the court held, because the arbitrator had \u201cen-\ndeavored to give effect to the parties\u2019 intent\u201d and \u201carticu-\n4               OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlate[d] a contractual basis for his decision.\u201d Id., at\n223\u2013224. Oxford\u2019s objections to the ruling were \u201csimply\ndressed-up arguments that the arbitrator interpreted its\nagreement erroneously.\u201d Id., at 224.\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to address\na circuit split on whether \u00a710(a)(4) allows a court to vacate\nan arbitral award in similar circumstances.1 Holding that\nit does not, we affirm the Court of Appeals.\n                              II\n  Under the FAA, courts may vacate an arbitrator\u2019s deci-\nsion \u201conly in very unusual circumstances.\u201d First Options\nof Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 942 (1995).\nThat limited judicial review, we have explained, \u201cmain-\ntain[s] arbitration\u2019s essential virtue of resolving disputes\nstraightaway.\u201d Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel,\nInc., 552 U. S. 576, 588 (2008). If parties could take\n\u201cfull-bore legal and evidentiary appeals,\u201d arbitration would\nbecome \u201cmerely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-\nconsuming judicial review process.\u201d Ibid.\n  Here, Oxford invokes \u00a710(a)(4) of the Act, which author-\nizes a federal court to set aside an arbitral award \u201cwhere\nthe arbitrator[] exceeded [his] powers.\u201d A party seeking\nrelief under that provision bears a heavy burden. \u201cIt is\nnot enough . . . to show that the [arbitrator] committed an\nerror\u2014or even a serious error.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U. S.,\nat 671. Because the parties \u201cbargained for the arbitra-\ntor\u2019s construction of their agreement,\u201d an arbitral decision\n\u201ceven arguably construing or applying the contract\u201d must\nstand, regardless of a court\u2019s view of its (de)merits. East-\nern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57,\n62 (2000) (quoting Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Compare675 F. 3d 215 (CA3 2012) (case below) (vacatur not proper),\nand Jock v. Sterling Jewelers Inc., 646 F. 3d 113 (CA2 2011) (same),\nwith Reed v. Florida Metropolitan Univ., Inc., 681 F. 3d 630 (CA5 2012)\n(vacatur proper).\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp., 363 U. S. 593, 599 (1960); Paperworkers v. Misco,\nInc., 484 U. S. 29, 38 (1987); internal quotation marks\nomitted). Only if \u201cthe arbitrator act[s] outside the scope\nof his contractually delegated authority\u201d\u2014issuing an\naward that \u201csimply reflect[s] [his] own notions of [economic]\njustice\u201d rather than \u201cdraw[ing] its essence from the con-\ntract\u201d\u2014may a court overturn his determination. Eastern\nAssociated Coal, 531 U. S., at 62 (quoting Misco, 484 U. S.,\nat 38). So the sole question for us is whether the arbitra-\ntor (even arguably) interpreted the parties\u2019 contract, not\nwhether he got its meaning right or wrong.2\n  And we have already all but answered that question just\nby summarizing the arbitrator\u2019s decisions, see supra, at 2\u2013\n3; they are, through and through, interpretations of the\nparties\u2019 agreement. The arbitrator\u2019s first ruling recited\nthe \u201cquestion of construction\u201d the parties had submitted\nto him: \u201cwhether [their] Agreement allows for class action\narbitration.\u201d App. 29\u201330. To resolve that matter, the\narbitrator focused on the arbitration clause\u2019s text, analyz-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We would face a different issue if Oxford had argued below that the\n\navailability of class arbitration is a so-called \u201cquestion of arbitrability.\u201d\nThose questions\u2014which \u201cinclude certain gateway matters, such as\nwhether parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether\na concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of\ncontroversy\u201d\u2014are presumptively for courts to decide. Green Tree\nFinancial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).\nA court may therefore review an arbitrator\u2019s determination of such a\nmatter de novo absent \u201cclear[] and unmistakabl[e]\u201d evidence that the\nparties wanted an arbitrator to resolve the dispute. AT&T Technolo-\ngies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986). Stolt-\nNielsen made clear that this Court has not yet decided whether the\navailability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability. See 559\nU. S., at 680. But this case gives us no opportunity to do so because\nOxford agreed that the arbitrator should determine whether its con-\ntract with Sutter authorized class procedures. See Brief for Petitioner\n38, n. 9 (conceding this point). Indeed, Oxford submitted that issue to\nthe arbitrator not once, but twice\u2014and the second time after Stolt-\nNielsen flagged that it might be a question of arbitrability.\n6          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning (whether correctly or not makes no difference) the\nscope of both what it barred from court and what it sent\nto arbitration. The arbitrator concluded, based on that\ntextual exegesis, that the clause \u201con its face . . . expresses\nthe parties\u2019 intent that class action arbitration can be\nmaintained.\u201d Id., at 32. When Oxford requested reconsid-\neration in light of Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator explained\nthat his prior decision was \u201cconcerned solely with the par-\nties\u2019 intent as evidenced by the words of the arbitration\nclause itself.\u201d App. 69. He then ran through his textual\nanalysis again, and reiterated his conclusion: \u201c[T]he text of\nthe clause itself authorizes\u201d class arbitration. Id., at 73.\nTwice, then, the arbitrator did what the parties had asked:\nHe considered their contract and decided whether it re-\nflected an agreement to permit class proceedings. That\nsuffices to show that the arbitrator did not \u201cexceed[ ] [his]\npowers.\u201d \u00a710(a)(4).\n   Oxford\u2019s contrary view relies principally on Stolt-\nNielsen. As noted earlier, we found there that an arbitra-\ntion panel exceeded its powers under \u00a710(a)(4) when it\nordered a party to submit to class arbitration. See supra,\nat 3. Oxford takes that decision to mean that \u201ceven the\n\u2018high hurdle\u2019 of Section 10(a)(4) review is overcome when\nan arbitrator imposes class arbitration without a sufficient\ncontractual basis.\u201d Reply Brief 5 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen,\n559 U. S., at 671). Under Stolt-Nielson, Oxford asserts, a\ncourt may thus vacate \u201cas ultra vires\u201d an arbitral decision\nlike this one for misconstruing a contract to approve class\nproceedings. Reply Brief 7.\n   But Oxford misreads Stolt-Nielsen: We overturned the\narbitral decision there because it lacked any contractual\nbasis for ordering class procedures, not because it lacked,\nin Oxford\u2019s terminology, a \u201csufficient\u201d one. The parties in\nStolt-Nielsen had entered into an unusual stipulation that\nthey had never reached an agreement on class arbitration.\nSee 559 U. S., at 668\u2013669, 673. In that circumstance, we\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted, the panel\u2019s decision was not\u2014indeed, could not\nhave been\u2014\u201cbased on a determination regarding the\nparties\u2019 intent.\u201d Id., at 673, n. 4; see id., at 676 (\u201cTh[e]\nstipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the par-\nties\u2019 intent\u201d). Nor, we continued, did the panel attempt to\nascertain whether federal or state law established a \u201cde-\nfault rule\u201d to take effect absent an agreement. Id., at 673.\nInstead, \u201cthe panel simply imposed its own conception of\nsound policy\u201d when it ordered class proceedings. Id., at\n675. But \u201cthe task of an arbitrator,\u201d we stated, \u201cis to\ninterpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.\u201d\nId., at 672. In \u201cimpos[ing] its own policy choice,\u201d the\npanel \u201cthus exceeded its powers.\u201d Id., at 677.\n   The contrast with this case is stark. In Stolt-Nielsen,\nthe arbitrators did not construe the parties\u2019 contract, and\ndid not identify any agreement authorizing class proceed-\nings. So in setting aside the arbitrators\u2019 decision, we\nfound not that they had misinterpreted the contract, but\nthat they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, the\narbitrator did construe the contract (focusing, per usual,\non its language), and did find an agreement to permit\nclass arbitration. So to overturn his decision, we would\nhave to rely on a finding that he misapprehended the par-\nties\u2019 intent. But \u00a710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits\ncourts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbi-\ntrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a\ncontract, not when he performed that task poorly. Stolt-\nNielsen and this case thus fall on opposite sides of the line\nthat \u00a710(a)(4) draws to delimit judicial review of arbitral\ndecisions.\n   The remainder of Oxford\u2019s argument addresses merely\nthe merits: The arbitrator, Oxford contends at length,\nbadly misunderstood the contract\u2019s arbitration clause. See\nBrief for Petitioner 21\u201328. The key text, again, goes as\nfollows: \u201cNo civil action concerning any dispute arising\nunder this Agreement shall be instituted before any court,\n8          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v.

The arbitrator thought that\nclause sent to arbitration all \u201ccivil action[s]\u201d barred from\ncourt, and viewed class actions as falling within that\ncategory. See supra, at 2. But Oxford points out that the\nprovision submits to arbitration not any \u201ccivil action[s],\u201d\nbut instead any \u201cdispute arising under\u201d the agreement.\nAnd in any event, Oxford claims, a class action is not a\nform of \u201ccivil action,\u201d as the arbitrator thought, but merely\na procedural device that may be available in a court. At\nbottom, Oxford maintains, this is a garden-variety arbi-\ntration clause, lacking any of the terms or features that\nwould indicate an agreement to use class procedures.\n   We reject this argument because, and only because, it is\nnot properly addressed to a court. Nothing we say in this\nopinion should be taken to reflect any agreement with the\narbitrator\u2019s contract interpretation, or any quarrel with\nOxford\u2019s contrary reading. All we say is that convincing a\ncourt of an arbitrator\u2019s error\u2014even his grave error\u2014is not\nenough. So long as the arbitrator was \u201carguably constru-\ning\u201d the contract\u2014which this one was\u2014a court may not\ncorrect his mistakes under \u00a710(a)(4). Eastern Associated\nCoal, 531 U. S., at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe potential for those mistakes is the price of agreeing\nto arbitration. As we have held before, we hold again: \u201cIt\nis the arbitrator\u2019s construction [of the contract] which was\nbargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision con-\ncerns construction of the contract, the courts have no\nbusiness overruling him because their interpretation of\nthe contract is different from his.\u201d Enterprise Wheel, 363\nU. S. at 599. The arbitrator\u2019s construction holds, however\ngood, bad, or ugly.\n   In sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live\nwith that choice. Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbi-\ntrator should determine what their contract meant, in-\ncluding whether its terms approved class arbitration. The\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe\nmistakenly so. But still, Oxford does not get to rerun\nthe matter in a court. Under \u00a710(a)(4), the question for a\njudge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties\u2019\ncontract correctly, but whether he construed it at all.\nBecause he did, and therefore did not \u201cexceed his powers,\u201d\nwe cannot give Oxford the relief it wants.

The Court accordingly refuses to set aside the\narbitrator\u2019s ruling because he was \u201c \u2018arguably construing\n. . . the contract\u2019 \u201d when he allowed respondent to proceed\non a classwide basis. Ante, at 8 (quoting Eastern Associated\nCoal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000)).\nToday\u2019s result follows directly from petitioner\u2019s concession\nand the narrow judicial review that federal law allows in\narbitration cases. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a710(a).\n    But unlike petitioner, absent members of the plaintiff\nclass never conceded that the contract authorizes the ar-\nbitrator to decide whether to conduct class arbitration.\nIt doesn\u2019t. If we were reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s interpre-\ntation of the contract de novo, we would have little trouble\nconcluding that he improperly inferred \u201c[a]n implicit\nagreement to authorize class-action arbitration . . . from\nthe fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\u201d Stolt-\nNielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp., 559 U. S. 662,\n685 (2010).\n    With no reason to think that the absent class members\n2          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\never agreed to class arbitration, it is far from clear that\nthey will be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate resolution\nof this dispute. Arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent, not\ncoercion,\u201d Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trus-\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989), and the absent members of the plaintiff class have\nnot submitted themselves to this arbitrator\u2019s authority in\nany way. It is true that they signed contracts with arbi-\ntration clauses materially identical to those signed by the\nplaintiff who brought this suit. But an arbitrator\u2019s erro-\nneous interpretation of contracts that do not authorize\nclass arbitration cannot bind someone who has not author-\nized the arbitrator to make that determination. As the\nCourt explains, \u201c[a]n arbitrator may employ class proce-\ndures only if the parties have authorized them.\u201d Ante,\nat 1.\n  The distribution of opt-out notices does not cure this\nfundamental flaw in the class arbitration proceeding in\nthis case. \u201c[A]rbitration is simply a matter of contract\nbetween the parties,\u201d First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.\nKaplan, 514 U.

Accord-\ningly, at least where absent class members have not been\nrequired to opt in, it is difficult to see how an arbitrator\u2019s\ndecision to conduct class proceedings could bind absent\nclass members who have not authorized the arbitrator to\ndecide on a classwide basis which arbitration procedures\nare to be used.\n  Class arbitrations that are vulnerable to collateral at-\ntack allow absent class members to unfairly claim the\n\u201cbenefit from a favorable judgment without subjecting\nthemselves to the binding effect of an unfavorable one,\u201d\nAmerican Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 546\u2013\n547 (1974). In the absence of concessions like Oxford\u2019s,\nthis possibility should give courts pause before concluding\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

Argued March 25, 2013\u2014Decided June 10, 2013\nRespondent Sutter, a pediatrician, provided medical services to peti-\n  tioner Oxford Health Plans\u2019 insureds under a fee-for-services contract\n  that required binding arbitration of contractual disputes. He none-\n  theless filed a proposed class action in New Jersey Superior Court, al-\n  leging that Oxford failed to fully and promptly pay him and other\n  physicians with similar Oxford contracts. On Oxford\u2019s motion, the\n  court compelled arbitration. The parties agreed that the arbitrator\n  should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration,\n  and he concluded that it did. Oxford filed a motion in federal court to\n  vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision, claiming that he had \u201cexceeded [his]\n  powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9\n  U.

S., at 671. Because the\n parties \u201cbargained for the arbitrator\u2019s construction of their agree-\n ment,\u201d an arbitral decision \u201ceven arguably construing or applying the\n contract\u201d must stand, regardless of a court\u2019s view of its (de)merits.\n Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v.

SUTTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Thus, the sole question on judicial review is whether the arbitrator\n    interpreted the parties\u2019 contract, not whether he construed it correct-\n    ly. Here, the arbitrator twice did what the parties asked: He consid-\n    ered their contract and decided whether it reflected an agreement to\n    permit class proceedings. That suffices to show that he did not ex-\n    ceed his powers under \u00a710(a)(4). Pp. 4\u22126.\n       (b) Stolt-Neilsen does not support Oxford\u2019s contrary view. There,\n    the parties stipulated that they had not reached an agreement on\n    class arbitration, so the arbitrators did not construe the contract, and\n    did not identify any agreement authorizing class proceedings. This\n    Court thus found not that they had misinterpreted the contract but\n    that they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, in stark con-\n    trast, the arbitrator did construe the contract, and did find an\n    agreement to permit class arbitration. So to overturn his decision,\n    this Court would have to find that he misapprehended the parties\u2019 in-\n    tent. But \u00a710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits courts to vacate an\n    arbitral decision only when the arbitrator strayed from his delegated\n    task of interpreting a contract, not when he performed that task\n    poorly. Oxford\u2019s remaining arguments go to the merits of the arbitra-\n    tor\u2019s contract interpretation and are thus irrelevant under \u00a710(a)(4).\n    Pp. 6\u22129.\n675 F. 3d 215, affirmed.\n\n   KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

See Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds\nInt\u2019l Corp., 559 U. S. 662, 684 (2010). In this case, an\narbitrator found that the parties\u2019 contract provided for\nclass arbitration. The question presented is whether in\ndoing so he \u201cexceeded [his] powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U. S. C. \u00a71 et seq.\nWe conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s decision survives the\nlimited judicial review \u00a710(a)(4) allows.\n                              I\n  Respondent John Sutter, a pediatrician, entered into a\ncontract with petitioner Oxford Health Plans, a health in-\nsurance company. Sutter agreed to provide medical care\nto members of Oxford\u2019s network, and Oxford agreed to pay\nfor those services at prescribed rates. Several years later,\nSutter filed suit against Oxford in New Jersey Superior\nCourt on behalf of himself and a proposed class of other\nNew Jersey physicians under contract with Oxford.

Noting that the question\nturned on \u201cconstruction of the parties\u2019 agreement,\u201d the\narbitrator focused on the text of the arbitration clause\nquoted above. Id., at 30. He reasoned that the clause sent\nto arbitration \u201cthe same universal class of disputes\u201d that it\nbarred the parties from bringing \u201cas civil actions\u201d in court:\nThe \u201cintent of the clause\u201d was \u201cto vest in the arbitration\nprocess everything that is prohibited from the court pro-\ncess.\u201d Id., at 31. And a class action, the arbitrator contin-\nued, \u201cis plainly one of the possible forms of civil action that\ncould be brought in a court\u201d absent the agreement. Ibid.\nAccordingly, he concluded that \u201con its face, the arbitration\nclause . . . expresses the parties\u2019 intent that class arbitra-\ntion can be maintained.\u201d Id., at 32.\n   Oxford filed a motion in federal court to vacate the\narbitrator\u2019s decision on the ground that he had \u201cexceeded\n[his] powers\u201d under \u00a710(a)(4) of the FAA.

S., at 684. The parties in Stolt-Nielsen\nhad stipulated that they had never reached an agreement\non class arbitration. Relying on \u00a710(a)(4), we vacated the\narbitrators\u2019 decision approving class proceedings because,\nin the absence of such an agreement, the arbitrators had\n\u201csimply . . . imposed [their] own view of sound policy.\u201d Id.,\nat 672.\n  Oxford immediately asked the arbitrator to reconsider\nhis decision on class arbitration in light of Stolt-Nielsen.\nThe arbitrator issued a new opinion holding that Stolt-\nNielsen had no effect on the case because this agreement\nauthorized class arbitration. Unlike in Stolt-Nielsen, the\narbitrator explained, the parties here disputed the mean-\ning of their contract; he had therefore been required \u201cto\nconstrue the arbitration clause in the ordinary way to\nglean the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d App. 72. And in performing\nthat task, the arbitrator continued, he had \u201cfound that\nthe arbitration clause unambiguously evinced an intention\nto allow class arbitration.\u201d Id., at 70. The arbitrator con-\ncluded by reconfirming his reasons for so construing the\nclause.\n  Oxford then returned to federal court, renewing its\neffort to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s decision under \u00a710(a)(4).\nOnce again, the District Court denied the motion, and the\nThird Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals first under-\nscored the limited scope of judicial review that \u00a710(a)(4)\nallows: So long as an arbitrator \u201cmakes a good faith at-\ntempt\u201d to interpret a contract, \u201ceven serious errors of law\nor fact will not subject his award to vacatur.\u201d 675 F. 3d\n215, 220 (2012). Oxford could not prevail under that\nstandard, the court held, because the arbitrator had \u201cen-\ndeavored to give effect to the parties\u2019 intent\u201d and \u201carticu-\n4               OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v.

Oxford\u2019s objections to the ruling were \u201csimply\ndressed-up arguments that the arbitrator interpreted its\nagreement erroneously.\u201d Id., at 224.\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U.

If parties could take\n\u201cfull-bore legal and evidentiary appeals,\u201d arbitration would\nbecome \u201cmerely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-\nconsuming judicial review process.\u201d Ibid.\n  Here, Oxford invokes \u00a710(a)(4) of the Act, which author-\nizes a federal court to set aside an arbitral award \u201cwhere\nthe arbitrator[] exceeded [his] powers.\u201d A party seeking\nrelief under that provision bears a heavy burden. \u201cIt is\nnot enough . . . to show that the [arbitrator] committed an\nerror\u2014or even a serious error.\u201d Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.

To resolve that matter, the\narbitrator focused on the arbitration clause\u2019s text, analyz-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 We would face a different issue if Oxford had argued below that the\n\navailability of class arbitration is a so-called \u201cquestion of arbitrability.\u201d\nThose questions\u2014which \u201cinclude certain gateway matters, such as\nwhether parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether\na concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of\ncontroversy\u201d\u2014are presumptively for courts to decide. Green Tree\nFinancial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U. S. 444, 452 (2003) (plurality opinion).\nA court may therefore review an arbitrator\u2019s determination of such a\nmatter de novo absent \u201cclear[] and unmistakabl[e]\u201d evidence that the\nparties wanted an arbitrator to resolve the dispute. AT&T Technolo-\ngies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U. S. 643, 649 (1986). Stolt-\nNielsen made clear that this Court has not yet decided whether the\navailability of class arbitration is a question of arbitrability. See 559\nU. S., at 680. But this case gives us no opportunity to do so because\nOxford agreed that the arbitrator should determine whether its con-\ntract with Sutter authorized class procedures. See Brief for Petitioner\n38, n. 9 (conceding this point). Indeed, Oxford submitted that issue to\nthe arbitrator not once, but twice\u2014and the second time after Stolt-\nNielsen flagged that it might be a question of arbitrability.\n6          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning (whether correctly or not makes no difference) the\nscope of both what it barred from court and what it sent\nto arbitration. The arbitrator concluded, based on that\ntextual exegesis, that the clause \u201con its face . . . expresses\nthe parties\u2019 intent that class action arbitration can be\nmaintained.\u201d Id., at 32. When Oxford requested reconsid-\neration in light of Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator explained\nthat his prior decision was \u201cconcerned solely with the par-\nties\u2019 intent as evidenced by the words of the arbitration\nclause itself.\u201d App. 69. He then ran through his textual\nanalysis again, and reiterated his conclusion: \u201c[T]he text of\nthe clause itself authorizes\u201d class arbitration. Id., at 73.\nTwice, then, the arbitrator did what the parties had asked:\nHe considered their contract and decided whether it re-\nflected an agreement to permit class proceedings. That\nsuffices to show that the arbitrator did not \u201cexceed[ ] [his]\npowers.\u201d \u00a710(a)(4).\n   Oxford\u2019s contrary view relies principally on Stolt-\nNielsen. As noted earlier, we found there that an arbitra-\ntion panel exceeded its powers under \u00a710(a)(4) when it\nordered a party to submit to class arbitration. See supra,\nat 3. Oxford takes that decision to mean that \u201ceven the\n\u2018high hurdle\u2019 of Section 10(a)(4) review is overcome when\nan arbitrator imposes class arbitration without a sufficient\ncontractual basis.\u201d Reply Brief 5 (quoting Stolt-Nielsen,\n559 U. S., at 671). Under Stolt-Nielson, Oxford asserts, a\ncourt may thus vacate \u201cas ultra vires\u201d an arbitral decision\nlike this one for misconstruing a contract to approve class\nproceedings. Reply Brief 7.\n   But Oxford misreads Stolt-Nielsen: We overturned the\narbitral decision there because it lacked any contractual\nbasis for ordering class procedures, not because it lacked,\nin Oxford\u2019s terminology, a \u201csufficient\u201d one. The parties in\nStolt-Nielsen had entered into an unusual stipulation that\nthey had never reached an agreement on class arbitration.\nSee 559 U. S., at 668\u2013669, 673. In that circumstance, we\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nnoted, the panel\u2019s decision was not\u2014indeed, could not\nhave been\u2014\u201cbased on a determination regarding the\nparties\u2019 intent.\u201d Id., at 673, n. 4; see id., at 676 (\u201cTh[e]\nstipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the par-\nties\u2019 intent\u201d). Nor, we continued, did the panel attempt to\nascertain whether federal or state law established a \u201cde-\nfault rule\u201d to take effect absent an agreement. Id., at 673.\nInstead, \u201cthe panel simply imposed its own conception of\nsound policy\u201d when it ordered class proceedings. Id., at\n675. But \u201cthe task of an arbitrator,\u201d we stated, \u201cis to\ninterpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy.\u201d\nId., at 672. In \u201cimpos[ing] its own policy choice,\u201d the\npanel \u201cthus exceeded its powers.\u201d Id., at 677.\n   The contrast with this case is stark. In Stolt-Nielsen,\nthe arbitrators did not construe the parties\u2019 contract, and\ndid not identify any agreement authorizing class proceed-\nings. So in setting aside the arbitrators\u2019 decision, we\nfound not that they had misinterpreted the contract, but\nthat they had abandoned their interpretive role. Here, the\narbitrator did construe the contract (focusing, per usual,\non its language), and did find an agreement to permit\nclass arbitration. So to overturn his decision, we would\nhave to rely on a finding that he misapprehended the par-\nties\u2019 intent. But \u00a710(a)(4) bars that course: It permits\ncourts to vacate an arbitral decision only when the arbi-\ntrator strayed from his delegated task of interpreting a\ncontract, not when he performed that task poorly. Stolt-\nNielsen and this case thus fall on opposite sides of the line\nthat \u00a710(a)(4) draws to delimit judicial review of arbitral\ndecisions.\n   The remainder of Oxford\u2019s argument addresses merely\nthe merits: The arbitrator, Oxford contends at length,\nbadly misunderstood the contract\u2019s arbitration clause. See\nBrief for Petitioner 21\u201328. The key text, again, goes as\nfollows: \u201cNo civil action concerning any dispute arising\nunder this Agreement shall be instituted before any court,\n8          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand all such disputes shall be submitted to final and bind-\ning arbitration.\u201d App. 15\u201316. The arbitrator thought that\nclause sent to arbitration all \u201ccivil action[s]\u201d barred from\ncourt, and viewed class actions as falling within that\ncategory. See supra, at 2. But Oxford points out that the\nprovision submits to arbitration not any \u201ccivil action[s],\u201d\nbut instead any \u201cdispute arising under\u201d the agreement.\nAnd in any event, Oxford claims, a class action is not a\nform of \u201ccivil action,\u201d as the arbitrator thought, but merely\na procedural device that may be available in a court. At\nbottom, Oxford maintains, this is a garden-variety arbi-\ntration clause, lacking any of the terms or features that\nwould indicate an agreement to use class procedures.\n   We reject this argument because, and only because, it is\nnot properly addressed to a court. Nothing we say in this\nopinion should be taken to reflect any agreement with the\narbitrator\u2019s contract interpretation, or any quarrel with\nOxford\u2019s contrary reading. All we say is that convincing a\ncourt of an arbitrator\u2019s error\u2014even his grave error\u2014is not\nenough. So long as the arbitrator was \u201carguably constru-\ning\u201d the contract\u2014which this one was\u2014a court may not\ncorrect his mistakes under \u00a710(a)(4). Eastern Associated\nCoal, 531 U. S., at 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe potential for those mistakes is the price of agreeing\nto arbitration. As we have held before, we hold again: \u201cIt\nis the arbitrator\u2019s construction [of the contract] which was\nbargained for; and so far as the arbitrator\u2019s decision con-\ncerns construction of the contract, the courts have no\nbusiness overruling him because their interpretation of\nthe contract is different from his.\u201d Enterprise Wheel, 363\nU. S. at 599. The arbitrator\u2019s construction holds, however\ngood, bad, or ugly.\n   In sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live\nwith that choice. Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbi-\ntrator should determine what their contract meant, in-\ncluding whether its terms approved class arbitration. The\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                  9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\narbitrator did what the parties requested: He provided an\ninterpretation of the contract resolving that disputed\nissue. His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe\nmistakenly so. But still, Oxford does not get to rerun\nthe matter in a court. Under \u00a710(a)(4), the question for a\njudge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties\u2019\ncontract correctly, but whether he construed it at all.\nBecause he did, and therefore did not \u201cexceed his powers,\u201d\nwe cannot give Oxford the relief it wants. We accordingly\naffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 569 U.

The Court accordingly refuses to set aside the\narbitrator\u2019s ruling because he was \u201c \u2018arguably construing\n. . . the contract\u2019 \u201d when he allowed respondent to proceed\non a classwide basis. Ante, at 8 (quoting Eastern Associated\nCoal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U. S. 57, 62 (2000)).\nToday\u2019s result follows directly from petitioner\u2019s concession\nand the narrow judicial review that federal law allows in\narbitration cases. See 9 U. S. C. \u00a710(a).\n    But unlike petitioner, absent members of the plaintiff\nclass never conceded that the contract authorizes the ar-\nbitrator to decide whether to conduct class arbitration.\nIt doesn\u2019t. If we were reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s interpre-\ntation of the contract de novo, we would have little trouble\nconcluding that he improperly inferred \u201c[a]n implicit\nagreement to authorize class-action arbitration . . . from\nthe fact of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\u201d Stolt-\nNielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int\u2019l Corp., 559 U. S. 662,\n685 (2010).\n    With no reason to think that the absent class members\n2          OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC v. SUTTER\n\n                      ALITO, J., concurring\n\never agreed to class arbitration, it is far from clear that\nthey will be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate resolution\nof this dispute. Arbitration \u201cis a matter of consent, not\ncoercion,\u201d Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trus-\ntees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989), and the absent members of the plaintiff class have\nnot submitted themselves to this arbitrator\u2019s authority in\nany way. It is true that they signed contracts with arbi-\ntration clauses materially identical to those signed by the\nplaintiff who brought this suit. But an arbitrator\u2019s erro-\nneous interpretation of contracts that do not authorize\nclass arbitration cannot bind someone who has not author-\nized the arbitrator to make that determination. As the\nCourt explains, \u201c[a]n arbitrator may employ class proce-\ndures only if the parties have authorized them.\u201d Ante,\nat 1.\n  The distribution of opt-out notices does not cure this\nfundamental flaw in the class arbitration proceeding in\nthis case. \u201c[A]rbitration is simply a matter of contract\nbetween the parties,\u201d First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.\nKaplan, 514 U. S. 938, 943 (1995), and an offeree\u2019s silence\ndoes not normally modify the terms of a contract, 1 Re-\nstatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a769(1) (1979). Accord-\ningly, at least where absent class members have not been\nrequired to opt in, it is difficult to see how an arbitrator\u2019s\ndecision to conduct class proceedings could bind absent\nclass members who have not authorized the arbitrator to\ndecide on a classwide basis which arbitration procedures\nare to be used.\n  Class arbitrations that are vulnerable to collateral at-\ntack allow absent class members to unfairly claim the\n\u201cbenefit from a favorable judgment without subjecting\nthemselves to the binding effect of an unfavorable one,\u201d\nAmerican Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 546\u2013\n547 (1974). In the absence of concessions like Oxford\u2019s,\nthis possibility should give courts pause before concluding\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

But because that argument was\nnot available to petitioner in light of its concession below,\nI join the opinion of the Court.\n</pre>",
