Argued April 23, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nThe Red River Compact (or Compact) is a congressionally sanctioned\n  agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin\n  among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\n  The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called\n  \u201cReaches,\u201d each of which is further divided into smaller \u201csubbasins.\u201d\n  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Okla-\n  homa\u2019s portion of Reach II, subbasin 5. In Reach II, the Compact\u2014\n  recognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store wa-\n  ter during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas,\n  Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored\n  water for the benefit of a downstream State\u2014granted control over\n  the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the\n  States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a\n  fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain\n  minimum levels. Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States\n  \u201cequal rights\u201d to the use of subbasin 5\u2019s waters when the flow is 3,000\n  cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, \u201cprovided no state is entitled to\n  more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].\u201d Under\n  the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intra-\n  state water administration.\n     Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas\n  state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas\n  and its rapidly growing population. After unsuccessfully attempting\n  to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a wa-\n  ter resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board\n  (OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of\n  the Red River at a point located in Oklahoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5\n2        TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    of Reach II. Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit\n    application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent\n    out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within\n    Oklahoma\u2019s borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneous-\n    ly with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRB\u2019s enforce-\n    ment of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by\n    federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce\n    Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water. The\n    District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the\n    Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.\n Pp. 9\u201322.\n       (a) Tarrant claims that \u00a75.05(b)(1) creates a borderless common\n in subbasin 5 in which each of the signatory States may cross each\n other\u2019s boundaries to access a shared pool of water. Tarrant observes\n that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal rights\u201d language grants each State an equal\n entitlement to subbasin 5\u2019s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and\n argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Com-\n pact\u2019s drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water accord-\n ing to state borders. The OWRB counters that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal\n rights\u201d afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5\u2019s ex-\n cess water within each State\u2019s own borders, but that its silence on\n cross-border rights indicates that the Compact\u2019s drafters had no in-\n tention to create any such rights in the signatory States. Pp. 9\u201311.\n       (b) Because interstate compacts are construed under contract-\n law principles, see Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 128, the Court\n begins by examining the Compact\u2019s express terms as the best indica-\n tion of the parties\u2019 intent. However, \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is, at the\n very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Com-\n pact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on\n the drafters\u2019 intent. Three things persuade the Court that the Com-\n pact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle\n that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that\n other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights ex-\n plicitly; and the parties\u2019 course of dealing. Pp. 11\u201322.\n         (1) The sovereign States possess an \u201cabsolute right to all their\n navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common\n use.\u201d Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410. So, for example,\n \u201c \u2018[a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water\n [within a State\u2019s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presump-\n tion\u2019 against defeat of a State\u2019s title.\u201d United States v. Alaska, 521\n U. S. 1, 34. It follows, then, that \u201c[i]f any inference at all is to be\n drawn from\u201d silence in compacts touching on the States\u2019 authority to\n                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncontrol their waters, \u201cit is that each State was left to regulate the ac-\ntivities of her own citizens.\u201d Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67.\nTarrant contends that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence infers that the signatory\nStates dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water\nwithin its borders. But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign\npowers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indi-\ncation of such devolution, not inscrutable silence. Tarrant counters\nthat its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign preroga-\ntive of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the\nwater within its borders. But adopting Tarrant\u2019s reading would nec-\nessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States si-\nlently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they\nagreed to the Compact. Pp. 14\u201316.\n        (2) Looking to the customary practices employed in other inter-\nstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent. See,\ne.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. 330, ___. Many compacts\nfeature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross\neach other\u2019s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and\nmany provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships\nwill operate. The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River\nCompact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never in-\ntended to be part of the agreement. Tarrant claims that not all inter-\nstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such\ncompact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to\nany contemplated diversions. Similarly, even if \u00a72.05(d) of the Com-\npact, which gives \u201c[e]ach Signatory State . . . the right to\u201d \u201c[u]se the\nbed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored\nwater, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according\nto this Compact,\u201d is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does\nso through express language, not through an inference from silence.\nPp. 16\u201320.\n        (3) The parties\u2019 conduct under the Compact also undermines\nTarrant\u2019s position. See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S., at ___.\nOnce the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed\nfor a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007. And Tar-\nrant\u2019s earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange\ndecision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water\nwithout payment. Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any oth-\ner Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of\ncross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signa-\ntory States has ever made such a claim. P. 20.\n        (4) Tarrant\u2019s remaining arguments\u2014that its interpretation is\nnecessary to realize the \u201cstructure and purpose of Reach II\u201d; and that\n\u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s 25 percent cap on each State\u2019s access to subbasin 5\u2019s ex-\n4         TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cess water implies that if a State cannot access sufficient water with-\n    in its borders to meet the cap, it must be able to cross borders to\n    reach that water\u2014are unpersuasive. Pp. 20\u201322.\n       2. The Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Com-\n    merce Clause. Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against\n    interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the\n    Compact from being distributed out of State. But Tarrant\u2019s assump-\n    tion that some water is left \u201cunallocated\u201d is incorrect. The interpre-\n    tive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the\n    flow is above 3,000 CFS, \u201call states are free to use whatever amount\n    of water they can put to beneficial use,\u201d subject to the requirement\n    that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses,\n    \u201ceach state will honor the other\u2019s right to 25% of the excess flow.\u201d If\n    more than 25 percent of subbasin 5\u2019s water is located in Oklahoma,\n    that water is not \u201cunallocated\u201d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\n    unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma\n    is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.\n    Pp. 22\u201324.\n656 F. 3d 1222, affirmed.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 569 U.

Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water\nDistrict (Tarrant), a Texas agency, claims that it is enti-\ntled to acquire water under the Compact from within\nOklahoma and that therefore the Compact pre-empts\nseveral Oklahoma statutes that restrict out-of-state diver-\nsions of water. In the alternative, Tarrant argues that the\nOklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on inter-\nstate commerce. We hold that Tarrant\u2019s claims lack merit.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Red River (or River) begins in the Llano Estacado\nMesa on the border between New Mexico and Texas.\nFrom this broad plain, it first runs through the Texas\nPanhandle and then marks the border between Texas and\nOklahoma. It continues in an easterly direction until it\nreaches the shared border with Arkansas. Once the River\n2     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenters Arkansas, it turns southward and flows into Loui-\nsiana, where it empties into the Mississippi and Atchafa-\nlaya Rivers.\n   As an important geographic feature of this region, the\nRed River has lent its name to a valley, a Civil War cam-\npaign, and a famed college football rivalry between the\nLonghorns of Texas and the Sooners of Oklahoma. But\ncollege pride has not been the only source of controversy\nbetween Texas and Oklahoma regarding the Red River.\nThe River has been the cause of numerous historical con-\nflicts between the two States, leading to a mobilization of\ntheir militias at one time, Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S.\n574, 580 (1922), and the declaration of martial law along a\nstretch of the River by Oklahoma Governor \u201cAlfalfa Bill\u201d\nMurray at another, see Okla. H. Res. 1121, 50th Legisla-\nture, 2d Sess. (2006) (resolution commemorating \u201cAlfalfa\nBill\u201d Murray\u2019s actions during the \u201cRed River Bridge War\u201d).\nSuch disputes over the River and its waters are a natural\nresult of the River\u2019s distribution of water flows. The Riv-\ner\u2019s course means that upstream States like Oklahoma\nand Texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water\nfrom both the River and its tributaries to the disadvantage\nof downstream States like Arkansas and especially Lou-\nisiana, which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store\nwater.\n   Absent an agreement among the States, disputes over\nthe allocation of water are subject to equitable apportion-\nment by the courts, Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,\n609 (1983), which often results in protracted and costly\nlegal proceedings. Thus in 1955, to forestall future dis-\nputes over the River and its water, Congress authorized\nthe States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas\nto negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the Red\nRiver basin among themselves. See Act of Aug. 11, 1955,\nPub. L. 346, 69 Stat. 654. These negotiations lasted over\n20 years and finally culminated in the signing of the Red\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

See Act of Dec.\n22, 1980, 94 Stat. 3305; Compact, 1 App. 7\u201351.\n   One of the Compact\u2019s principal purposes was \u201c[t]o pro-\nvide an equitable apportionment among the Signatory\nStates of the water of the Red River and its tributaries.\u201d\n\u00a71.01(b), id., at 9. The Compact governs the allocation of\nwater along the Red River and its tributaries from the\nNew Mexico and Texas border to its terminus in Louisi-\nana. \u00a7\u00a72.12(a)\u2013(e), id., at 13. This stretch is divided into\nfive separate subdivisions called \u201cReach[es],\u201d ibid., each of\nwhich is further divided into smaller \u201csubbasins,\u201d see, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a75.01\u20135.05, id., at 22\u201326 (describing subbasins 1 through\n5 of Reach II). (See Appendix A, infra, for a map.)\n   At issue in this case are rights under the Compact to\nwater located in Oklahoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5 of\nReach II, which occupies \u201cthat portion of the Red River,\ntogether with its tributaries, from Denison Dam down to\nthe Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary, excluding all\ntributaries included in the other four subbasins of Reach\nII.\u201d \u00a75.05(a), 1 App. 24\u201325. (See Appendix B, infra, for a\nmap.) The Compact\u2019s interpretive comments1 explain that\nduring negotiations, Reach II posed the greatest difficulty\nto the parties\u2019 efforts to reach agreement. Comment on\nArt. V, 1 App. 27. The problem was that Louisiana, the\nfarthest downstream State, lacks suitable reservoir sites\nand therefore cannot store water during high flow periods\nto meet its future needs. The upstream States (Texas,\nOklahoma, and Arkansas), which control the River\u2019s flow,\nwere unwilling to release water stored within their own\nreservoirs for the benefit of any downstream States, like\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Interpretive\n               comments were included in the Compact so that future\nreaders \u201cmight be apprised of the intent of the Compact Negotiation\nCommittee with regard to each Article of the Compact.\u201d Compact,\nComment on Preamble, 1 App. 9.\n4       TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nLouisiana. Without any such release, there would be no\nguaranteed flow of water to Louisiana.\n  The provisions of the Compact relating to Reach II were\ncrafted to address this problem. To this end, Reach II was\ndivided into five subbasins. The upstream subbasins,\nnumbered 1 through 4, were drawn to end at \u201cexisting,\nauthorized or proposed last downstream major damsites,\u201d\nsee, e.g., \u00a75.01(a), id., at 22, on the tributaries leading to\nthe Red River before reaching the main stem of the River.\nThese dams allow the parties managing them to control\nwater along the tributaries before it travels farther down-\nstream and joins the flow of the main stem of the River.\nFor the most part, the Compact granted control over the\nwater in these subbasins to the States in which each\nsubbasin is located.2 The remaining subbasin, subbasin 5,\ninstead requires that water be allowed to flow to Louisi-\nana through the main stem of the River at certain mini-\nmum levels, assuring Louisiana an allocation of the River\u2019s\nwaters and solving its flowthrough problem.\n  The provision of the Compact central to the present\ndispute is \u00a75.05(b)(1), which sets the following allocation\nduring times of normal flow:\n       \u201c(1) The Signatory States shall have equal rights to\n     the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5 and un-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Within subbasins 1, 2, and 4, water was fully apportioned to a single\n\nState. See Compact \u00a75.01(b), id., at 22\u201323 (apportioning water of\nsubbasin 1 and its \u201cunrestricted use\u201d to Oklahoma); \u00a75.02(b), id., at 23\n(same for Texas with respect to subbasin 2); \u00a75.04(b), id., at 24 (same\nfor Texas with respect to subbasin 4). Only subbasin 3, which includes\nportions of Oklahoma and Arkansas, breaks from this pattern and was\ndivided along the lines of a 60-to-40 split, with both States having \u201cfree\nand unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respec-\ntive states, subject, however, to the limitation that Oklahoma shall\nallow a quantity of water equal to the 40 percent of the total runoff\noriginating below the following existing, authorized or proposed last\nmajor downstream damsites in Oklahoma to flow into Arkansas.\u201d\n\u00a75.03(b), id., at 23\u201324.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Dept.\nof Commerce, Census Bureau, P. Mackun & S. Wilson,\nPopulation Distribution and Change: 2000 to 2010 (Mar.\n2011). This growth has strained regional water supplies,\nand north Texas\u2019 need for water has been exacerbated in\nrecent years by a long and costly drought. See generally\nGalbraith, A Drought More Than Texas-Size, International\nHerald Tribune, Oct. 3, 2011, p. 4.\n  Against this backdrop, petitioner Tarrant, a Texas state\nagency responsible for providing water to north-central\nTexas (including the cities of Fort Worth, Arlington, and\nMansfield), has endeavored to secure new sources of water\nfor the area it serves. From 2000 to 2002, Tarrant, along\nwith several other Texas water districts, offered to pur-\nchase water from Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chicka-\nsaw Nations. See 2 App. 336\u2013382. But these negotiations\nwere unsuccessful and Tarrant eventually abandoned\nthese efforts.\n  Because Texas\u2019 need for water only continued to grow,\nTarrant settled on a new course of action. In 2007, Tar-\nrant sought a water resource permit from the Oklahoma\nWater Resources Board (OWRB),5 respondents here, to\ntake 310,000 acre feet6 per year of surface water from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Under  \u00a72.10 of the Compact each signatory State retains \u201cthe right\nor power . . . to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use,\nand control of water.\u201d Id., at 12. Thus, the Compact does not expressly\npre-empt any state laws that address the control of water. Oklahoma\nlaw, in turn, requires that any \u201cstate or federal governmental agency\u201d\nthat \u201cintend[s] to acquire the right to the beneficial use of any water\u201d in\nOklahoma must apply to the OWRB for \u201ca permit to appropriate\u201d water\nbefore \u201ccommencing any construction\u201d or \u201ctaking [any water] from any\nconstructed works.\u201d Okla.

HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKiamichi River, a tributary of the Red River located in\nOklahoma. Tarrant proposed to divert the Kiamichi River,\nat a point located in subbasin 5 of Reach II, before it dis-\ncharges into the Red River and, according to Tarrant, be-\ncomes too saline for potable use.\n  Tarrant knew, however, that Oklahoma would likely\ndeny its permits because various state laws (collectively,\nthe Oklahoma water statutes) effectively prevent out-of-\nstate applicants from taking or diverting water from within\nOklahoma\u2019s borders. These statutes include a require-\nment that the OWRB consider, when evaluating an appli-\ncation to take water out of State, whether that water\n\u201ccould feasibly be transported to alleviate water short-\nages in the State of Oklahoma.\u201d Okla. Stat., Tit. 82,\n\u00a7105.12(A)(5) (West 2013). The statutes also require that\nno permit issued by the OWRB to use water outside of the\nState shall \u201c[i]mpair the ability of the State of Oklahoma\nto meet its obligations under any interstate stream com-\npact.\u201d \u00a7105.12A(B)(1). A separate provision creates a\npermitting review process that applies only to out-of-\nstate water users. \u00a7105.12(F). Oklahoma also requires\nlegislative approval for out-of-state water-use permits,\n\u00a7105.12A(D), and further provides that \u201c[w]ater use within\nOklahoma . . . be developed to the maximum extent feasi-\nble for the benefit of Oklahoma so that out-of-state down-\nstream users will not acquire vested rights therein to the\ndetriment of the citizens of this state,\u201d \u00a71086.1(A)(3).\nInterpreting these laws, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general has\nconcluded that \u201cwe consider the proposition unrealistic\nthat an out-of-state user is a proper permit applicant\nbefore the [OWRB]\u201d because \u201c[w]e can find no intention to\ncreate the possibility that such a valuable resource as\nwater may become bound, without compensation, to use by\nan out-of-state user.\u201d 1 App. 118.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntionary 19 (1966).\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

As\nrelevant here, Tarrant sought to enjoin enforcement of the\nOklahoma water statutes by the OWRB. Tarrant argued\nthat the statutes, and the interpretation of them adopted\nby Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, were pre-empted by\nfederal law and violated the Commerce Clause by discrim-\ninating against interstate commerce in water.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment for the\nOWRB on both of Tarrant\u2019s claims.

Section 5.05(b)(1) provides:\n     \u201cThe Signatory States shall have equal rights to the\n     use of runoff originating in subbasin 5 and undesig-\n     nated water following into subbasin 5, so long as the\n     flow of the Red River at the Arkansas-Louisiana state\n     boundary is 3,000 [CFS] or more, provided no state is\n     entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess\n     of 3,000 [CFS].\u201d 1 App. 25.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The parties have stipulated that OWRB will not take action on\n\nTarrant\u2019s application until this litigation has concluded. Brief for Peti-\ntioner 16.\n10      TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Tarrant\u2019s view, this provision essentially creates a\nborderless common in which each of the four signatory\nStates may cross each other\u2019s boundaries to access a\nshared pool of water. Tarrant reaches this interpretation\nin two steps. First, it observes that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal\nrights\u201d language grants each State an equal entitlement to\nthe waters of subbasin 5, subject to a 25 percent cap.\nSecond, Tarrant argues \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence concerning\nstate lines indicates that the Compact\u2019s drafters did not\nintend to allocate water according to state borders in this\nsection. According to Tarrant, \u201cthe \u201825 percent\u2019 language\n[of \u00a75.05(b)(1)] makes clear that, in exercising its \u2018equal\nrights\u2019 to the common pool of water, no State may take\nmore than a one-quarter share,\u201d Reply Brief 3, but any of\nthe signatory States may \u201ccross state lines to obtain [its]\nshar[e] of Subbasin 5 waters,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32.\n   The OWRB disputes this reading. In its view, the\n\u201cequal rights\u201d promised by \u00a75.05(b)(1) afford each State an\nequal opportunity to make use of the excess water within\nsubbasin 5 of Reach II but only within each State\u2019s own\nborders. This is because the OWRB reads \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s\nsilence differently from Tarrant. The OWRB interprets\nthat provision\u2019s absence of language granting any cross-\nborder rights to indicate that the Compact\u2019s drafters had\nno intention to create any such rights in the signatory\nStates.\n   Unraveling the meaning of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence with\nrespect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the\nCompact pre-empts the Oklahoma water statutes.8 If\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The Compact Clause of the Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State\n\nshall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or\nCompact with another State.\u201d Art. I, \u00a710, cl. 3. Accordingly, before a\ncompact between two States can be given effect it must be approved by\nCongress. See Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 66 (2003). Once a\ncompact receives such approval, it is \u201ctransform[ed] . . . into a law of\nthe United States.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence means that state borders are irrele-\nvant to the allocation of water in subbasin 5 of Reach II,\nthen the Oklahoma water laws at issue conflict with the\ncross-border rights created by federal law in the form of\nthe Compact and must be pre-empted. But if \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s\nsilence instead reflects a background understanding on\nthe part of the Compact\u2019s drafters that state borders were\nto be respected within the Compact\u2019s allocation, then the\nOklahoma statutes do not conflict with the Compact\u2019s\nallocation of water.\n                                B\n   Interstate compacts are construed as contracts under\nthe principles of contract law. Texas v. New Mexico, 482\nU. S. 124, 128 (1987). So, as with any contract, we begin\nby examining the express terms of the Compact as the\nbest indication of the intent of the parties, see also Mon-\ntana v. Wyoming, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and n. 4, ___, (2011)\n(slip op., at 5, and n. 4, 17); Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts \u00a7203(b) (1979).\n   Tarrant argues that because other provisions of the\nCompact reference state borders, \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence with\nrespect to state lines must mean that the Compact\u2019s draft-\ners intended to permit cross-border diversions. For exam-\nple, \u00a75.03(b), which governs subbasin 3 of Reach II,\nprovides that\n     \u201c[t]he States of Oklahoma and Arkansas shall have\n     free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin\n     within their respective states, subject, however, to the\n     limitation that Oklahoma shall allow a quantity of\n     water equal to . . . 40 percent of the total runoff origi-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSupremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, then ensures that a congressionally\napproved compact, as a federal law, pre-empts any state law that\nconflicts with the Compact. See Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De\nla Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 152\u2013153 (1982).\n12     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     nating below the following existing, authorized or\n     proposed last major downstream damsites in Okla-\n     homa to flow into Arkansas.\u201d 1 App. 23\u201324 (emphasis\n     added).\nSection 6.03(b), which covers subbasin 3 of Reach III,\nsimilarly provides that \u201cTexas and Louisiana within their\nrespective boundaries shall each have the unrestricted use\nof the water of this subbasin subject to the following\n[conditions].\u201d Id., at 33 (emphasis added). Thus, \u00a75.03(b)\nand \u00a76.03(b) mimic \u00a75.05(b)(1) in allocating water rights\nwithin a subbasin, but differ in that they make explicit ref-\nerence to water use \u201cwithin\u201d state boundaries. Relying on\nthe expressio unius canon of construction, Tarrant finds\nthat \u00a75.05(b)\u2019s silence regarding borders is significant\nbecause \u201c \u2018[w]here Congress includes particular language\nin one section of a statute but omits it in another section of\nthe same Act, it is generally presumed [that] Congress\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 29 (quoting Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)).\n   But Tarrant\u2019s argument fails to account for other sec-\ntions of the Compact that cut against its reading. For\nexample, \u00a75.05(b)(3), which governs the waters of subbasin\n5 in Reach II when flows are below 1,000 CFS, requires\nthat during such periods, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma\nallow water \u201cwithin their respective states to flow into the\nRed River as required to maintain a 1,000 [CFS] flow at\nthe Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary.\u201d 1 App. 25 (em-\nphasis added). Obviously none of the upstream States can\nredirect water that lies outside of their borders, so the\nphrase \u201cwithin their respective states\u201d is superfluous in\n\u00a75.05(b)(3). In contrast, \u00a75.05(b)(2), which governs when\nthe River\u2019s flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana border is above\n1,000 CFS but below 3,000 CFS, requires that upstream\nStates allow a flow to Louisiana equivalent to 40 percent\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof total weekly runoff originating within the subbasin and\n40 percent of undesignated water flowing into subbasin 5\nof Reach II. Id., at 25. This language can only refer to\nwater within each State\u2019s borders because otherwise each\nState would have to contribute 40 percent to the total\nwater flow, which would add up to more than 100 percent.\nRead together and to avoid absurd results, \u00a7\u00a75.05(b)(2)\nand (3) suggest that each upstream State is individually\nresponsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin 5 water\nlocated within its respective borders flows down to Louisi-\nana, even though \u00a75.05(b)(2) lacks any explicit reference to\nstate lines.\n   Applying Tarrant\u2019s understanding of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s si-\nlence regarding state lines to other of the Compact\u2019s provi-\nsions would produce further anomalous results. Consider\n\u00a76.01(b). That provision states that \u201cTexas is apportioned\nsixty (60) percent of the runoff of [subbasin 1 of Reach III]\nand shall have unrestricted use thereof; Arkansas is enti-\ntled to forty (40) percent of the runoff of this subbasin.\u201d\nId., at 32. Because Texas is upstream from Arkansas,\nwater flows from Texas to Arkansas. Given this situation,\nthe commonsense reason for \u00a76.01(b)\u2019s 60-to-40 allocation\nis to prevent Texas from barring the flow of water to Ar-\nkansas. While there is no reference to state boundaries in\nthe section\u2019s text, the unstated assumption underlying this\nprovision is that Arkansas must wait for its 40 percent\nshare to go through Texas before it can claim it. But\napplying Tarrant\u2019s understanding of silence regarding\nstate borders to this section would imply that Arkansas\ncould enter into Texas without having to wait for the\nwater that will inevitably reach it. This counterintuitive\noutcome would thwart the self-evident purposes of the\nCompact. Further, other provisions of the Compact share\nthis structure of allocating a proportion of water that will\n14      TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nflow from an upstream State to a downstream one.9 Ac-\ncepting Tarrant\u2019s reading would upset the balance struck\nby all these sections.\n   At the very least, the problems that arise from Tarrant\u2019s\nproposed reading suggest that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is\nambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Com-\npact. We therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed\nlight on the intent of the Compact\u2019s drafters. See Okla-\nhoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 235, n. 5 (1991).10\nThree things persuade us that cross-border rights were\nnot granted by the Compact: the well-established principle\nthat States do not easily cede their sovereign powers,\nincluding their control over waters within their own terri-\ntories; the fact that other interstate water compacts have\ntreated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties\u2019\ncourse of dealing.\n                             1\n   The background notion that a State does not easily cede\nits sovereignty has informed our interpretation of inter-\nstate compacts. We have long understood that as sover-\neign entities in our federal system, the States possess an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See Compact \u00a74.01(b), 1 App. 18 (\u201cThe annual flow within this sub-\n\nbasin is hereby apportioned sixty (60) percent to Texas and forty (40)\npercent to Oklahoma\u201d); \u00a76.02(b), id., at 32 (\u201cArkansas is apportioned\nsixty (60) percent of the runoff of this subbasin and shall have unre-\nstricted use thereof; Louisiana is entitled to forty (40) percent of the\nrunoff of this subbasin\u201d).\n  10 There is, however, one interpretive tool that is inapplicable here:\n\nthe presumption against pre-emption. The Court of Appeals repeatedly\nreferenced and relied upon the presumption in its opinion. See 656\nF. 3d 1222, 1239, 1242, 1245\u20131246 (CA10 2011). Yet the presumption\nagainst pre-emption is rooted in \u201crespect for the States as \u2018independent\nsovereigns in our federal system\u2019 \u201d and \u201cassume[s] that \u2018Congress does\nnot cavalierly pre-empt\u2019 \u201d state laws. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565\u2013566, n. 3 (2009). When the States themselves have drafted and\nagreed to the terms of a compact, and Congress\u2019 role is limited to\napproving that compact, there is no reason to invoke the presumption.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Drawing on this\nprinciple, we have held that ownership of submerged\nlands, and the accompanying power to control navigation,\nfishing, and other public uses of water, \u201cis an essen-\ntial attribute of sovereignty,\u201d United States v. Alaska,\n521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Consequently, \u201c \u2018[a] court deciding\na question of title to [a] bed of navigable water [within a\nState\u2019s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presump-\ntion\u2019 against defeat of a State\u2019s title.\u201d Id., at 34 (quoting\nMontana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 552 (1981)). See\nalso Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001); Utah Div. of\nState Lands v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, 195 (1987).\n   Given these principles, when confronted with silence in\ncompacts touching on the States\u2019 authority to control their\nwaters, we have concluded that \u201c[i]f any inference at all is\nto be drawn from [such] silence on the subject of regula-\ntory authority, we think it is that each State was left to\nregulate the activities of her own citizens.\u201d Virginia v.\nMaryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67 (2003). Cf. New Jersey v. New\nYork, 523 U. S. 767, 783, n. 6 (1998) (\u201c[T]he silence of\nthe Compact was on the subject of settled law governing\navulsion, which the parties\u2019 silence showed no intent to\nmodify\u201d).\n   Tarrant asks us to infer from \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence re-\ngarding state borders that the signatory States have\ndispensed with the core state prerogative to control water\nwithin their own boundaries.11 But as the above demon-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Of course, the power of States to control water within their borders\n\nmay be subject to limits in certain circumstances. For example, those\nimposed by the Commerce Clause. See Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel.\nDouglas, 458 U. S. 941, 954\u2013958 (1982). Here we deal only with\nwhether the parties\u2019 silence on state boundaries in the allocation of\nwater under a compact suggests that borders are irrelevant for that\n16     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nstrates, States rarely relinquish their sovereign powers, so\nwhen they do we would expect a clear indication of such\ndevolution, not inscrutable silence. We think that the\nbetter understanding of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is that the\nparties drafted the Compact with this legal background in\nmind, and therefore did not intend to grant each other\ncross-border rights under the Compact.\n  In response, Tarrant contends that its interpretation\nwould not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Okla-\nhoma because that State would retain its authority to\nregulate the water within its borders. Because anyone\nseeking water from Oklahoma would still have to apply to\nthe OWRB, receive a permit, and abide by its conditions,\nTarrant argues that Oklahoma\u2019s sovereign authority\nremains untouched by its interpretation. But Tarrant\ncannot have it both ways. Adopting Tarrant\u2019s reading\nwould necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and\nthree other States silently surrendered substantial control\nover the water within their borders when they agreed to\nthe Compact. Given the background principles we have\ndescribed above, we find this unlikely to have been the\nintent of the Compact\u2019s signatories.\n                              2\n  Looking to the customary practices employed in other\ninterstate compacts also helps us to ascertain the intent of\nthe parties to this Compact. See Alabama v. North Carolina,\n560 U. S. 330 ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9); Oklahoma,\n501 U. S., at 235, n. 5; Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S.\n554, 565 (1983). See also Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts \u00a7203(b) (explaining that \u201cusage of trade\u201d may be\nrelevant in interpreting a contract). Many of these other\ncompacts feature language that unambiguously permits\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nallocation. As noted infra, at 23\u201324, Tarrant has not raised any Com-\nmerce Clause challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s control of the water allocated to\nit by the Compact.\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncants from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana could all apply\nto the OWRB for permits to take water from Oklahoma.\nThe OWRB would then be obligated to determine the total\namount of water in Oklahoma beyond the 25 percent cap\ncreated in \u00a75.05(b)(1), given that the Compact would only\nobligate Oklahoma to deliver water beyond its quarter\nshare. This alone would be a herculean task because the\nCompact does not require ongoing monitoring or account-\ning, see Compact \u00a72.11, 1 App. 13, and not all of the water\nin subbasin 5 is located or originates in Oklahoma. More-\nover, the OWRB would be tasked with determining the\npriority under the Compact of applicants from other\nStates. This would almost certainly require the OWRB to\nnot only determine whether Oklahoma had received more\nor less than its 25 percent allotment, but whether other\nStates had as well. Put plainly, the end result would be\na jurisdictional and administrative quagmire. The pro-\nvisions in the other interstate water compacts resolve\nthese complications. The absence of comparable provisions\nin the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-\nborder rights were never intended to be part of the States\u2019\nagreement.\n  Tarrant counters that not all interstate compacts that\npermit cross-border diversions have explicit language to\nthis effect. On this front, Tarrant manages to identify one\ninterstate compact that it contends permits cross-border\ndiversions without express language to that effect, the\nUpper Niobrara River Compact, Pub. L. 91\u201352, 83 Stat.\n86. Tarrant observes that this compact, which deals with\na river mostly located in Nebraska with only a small\nportion in Wyoming, provides that \u201c[t]here shall be no\nrestrictions on the use of the surface waters of [the river]\nby Wyoming.\u201d See Art. V(A)1, id., at 88. Tarrant suggests\nthat this language, coupled with the fact that the bulk of\nthe river is in Nebraska, implicitly indicates that the\ncompact grants Wyoming a right to enter Nebraska and\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nuse the river\u2019s water. First, we are not convinced that a\nsingle compact\u2019s failure to reference state borders does\nmuch to detract from the overall custom in this area. See\nsupra, at 16\u201318, and n. 12. Second, the Upper Niobrara\nRiver Compact is not a helpful counterexample for Tar-\nrant. The general provision that Tarrant quotes is paired\nwith a host of detailed conditions. See Arts. V(A)1(a)\u2013(f),\n83 Stat. 88. Contrary to Tarrant\u2019s position, then, assum-\ning that the Upper Niobrara River compact does create\nany cross-border rights, it does so not through silence, but\nthrough the detailed scheme that would apply to any such\ncontemplated diversions.\n   Tarrant also argues that \u00a72.05(d) of the Red River Com-\npact, which provides that \u201c[e]ach Signatory State shall\nhave the right to\u201d \u201c[u]se the bed and banks of the Red\nRiver and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported\nor exported water, and water apportioned according to this\nCompact,\u201d 1 App. 11, in fact authorizes cross-border diver-\nsions. Because the present border between Texas and\nOklahoma east of the Texas Panhandle is set by the vege-\ntation line on the south bank of the River, Red River\nBoundary Compact, 114 Stat. 919, Tarrant contends that\n\u00a72.05(d) reflects an understanding on the part of the Com-\npact\u2019s drafters that state borders could be crossed. But the\nissue is not as simple as Tarrant makes it out to be. When\nthe Compact was drafted, the Texas-Oklahoma border was\nfixed at the south bank of the River. See Texas v. Okla-\nhoma, 457 U. S. 172 (1982). If Texas was able to access\nwater through the south bank of the River\u2014an issue left\nunbriefed by the parties\u2014the Compact\u2019s framers may\nhave believed that Texas could reach the River and take\nwater from it without having to enter Oklahoman land,\ncasting doubt on Tarrant\u2019s theory. In any event, even if\n\u00a72.05(d) is read to establish a cross-border right, it does so\nthrough express language setting forth the location and\npurposes under which such an incursion is permissible.\n20    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThis is different from the inference from silence that\nTarrant asks us to draw in \u00a75.05(b)(1).\n                             3\n   The parties\u2019 conduct under the Compact also under-\nmines Tarrant\u2019s position. A \u201cpart[y\u2019s] course of perfor-\nmance under the Compact is highly significant\u201d evidence\nof its understanding of the compact\u2019s terms. Alabama v.\nNorth Carolina, 560 U. S., at___ (slip op., at 14). Since the\nCompact was approved by Congress in 1980, no signatory\nState had pressed for a cross-border diversion under the\nCompact until Tarrant filed its suit in 2007. Brief for\nRespondents 26, 49\u201351. Indeed, Tarrant attempted to\npurchase water from Oklahoma over the course of 2000\nuntil 2002, see supra, at 7, a strange offer if Tarrant be-\nlieved it was entitled to demand such water without pay-\nment under the Compact.\n   In response, Tarrant maintains that there were \u201ccompel-\nling business reasons\u201d for it to purchase water. Reply\nBrief 17. We are unpersuaded. If Tarrant believed that it\nhad a right to water located in Oklahoma, there would\nhave been \u201ccompelling business reasons\u201d to mention this\nright given that billions of dollars were at stake. See 2\nApp. 362\u2013363 (summarizing Texas purchase proposal).\nYet there is no indication that Tarrant or any other Texas\nagency or the State of Texas itself previously made any\nmention of cross-border rights within the Compact, and\nnone of the other signatory States has ever made such a\nclaim.\n                            4\n  The Compact creates no cross-border rights in Texas.\nTarrant\u2019s remaining arguments do not persuade us\notherwise.\n  First, Tarrant argues that its interpretation of the\nCompact is necessary to realize the \u201cstructure and purpose\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof Reach II.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 34\u201338. Tarrant contends\nthat because the boundary of subbasin 5 is set by the\nlocation of the last existing, authorized, or proposed sites\nfor a downstream dam before the Red River, see Compact\n\u00a7\u00a75.01(a), 5.02(a), 5.03(b), 5.04(a), 1 App. 22\u201324, the Com-\npact allows each of the States upstream from Louisiana to\nprevent water from flowing from its tributaries into sub-\nbasin 5. Tarrant reasons that each State will therefore\nhold whatever water it needs in its upstream basins.\nGiven this, Tarrant maintains that any water that a State\nvoluntarily allows to reach subbasin 5 must be surplus\nwater that State did not intend to use, and if the upstream\nState has no need for that water, then there is no reason\nnot to allow other States to access and use it, even across\nborders.\n   This argument is founded on a shaky premise: It as-\nsumes that flows from these dammed-up tributaries are\nthe sole source of water in subbasin 5. But \u00a75.05(b)(1)\nexplains that \u201c[s]ignatory States shall have equal rights to\nthe use of runoff originating in subbasin 5,\u201d as well as\n\u201cwater flowing into subbasin 5,\u201d which would include flows\nfrom the main stem of the River itself. Id., at 25. Thus,\nthere are waters that are specific to subbasin 5 separate\nfrom those originating in the tributaries covered by sub-\nbasins 1 through 4. Tarrant\u2019s account of the purposes of\nsubbasin 5 does not explain how these waters were to be\nallocated.\n   Tarrant\u2019s second argument regarding the purposes of\nReach II is that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s 25 percent cap on each State\u2019s\naccess to excess water in subbasin 5 should be read to\nimply that if a State cannot access sufficient water within\nits borders to meet its share under the cap, then it must be\nable to cross borders to reach that water. Were it other-\nwise, Tarrant explains, the 25 percent cap would have no\npurpose. To support this argument, Tarrant draws on a\n1970 engineering report that it contends shows that only\n22    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n16 percent of the freshwater flowing into subbasin 5 was\nlocated in Texas. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5. The OWRB\nchallenges this percentage with its own calculations\ndrawn from the report, and asserts that Texas had access\nto at least 29 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5\nwithin its own borders. Brief for Respondents 26, 47\u201348,\nand n. 17.\n  Fortunately, we need not delve into calculations based\non a decades-old engineering report to resolve this argu-\nment. As we have explained, supra, at 4\u20136, Texas does not\nhave a minimum guarantee of 25 percent of the excess\nwater in subbasin 5. If it believes that Oklahoma is using\nmore than its 25 percent allotment and wishes to stop it\nfrom doing so, then it may call for an accounting under\n\u00a72.11 of the Compact and, depending on the results of that\naccounting, insist that Oklahoma desist from taking more\nthan its provided share. See Compact \u00a72.11, and Com-\nment on Art. II, 1 App. 13\u201316. This is the appropriate\nremedy provided under the Compact. But Texas has never\ndone so and Tarrant offers no evidence that in the present\nday Texas cannot access its 25 percent share on its own\nland.\n                             C\n  Under the Compact\u2019s terms, water located within Okla-\nhoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II remains under\nOklahoma\u2019s control. Accordingly, Tarrant\u2019s theory that\nOklahoma\u2019s water statutes are pre-empted because they\nprevent Texas from exercising its rights under the Com-\npact must fail for the reason that the Compact does not\ncreate any cross-border rights in signatory States.\n                          III\n  Tarrant also challenges the constitutionality of the\nOklahoma water statutes under a dormant Commerce\nClause theory. Tarrant argues that the Oklahoma water\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Brief for Petitioner\n47\u201348 (quoting Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553\nU. S. 328, 338 (2008)). Tarrant\u2019s argument is premised on\nthe position that if we \u201cadopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s or re-\nspondent\u2019s interpretation [of the Compact], . . . a substan-\ntial amount of Reach II, Subbasin 5 water located in Ok-\nlahoma is not apportioned to any State and therefore is\navailable to permit applicants like Tarrant.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 47. So, Tarrant continues, because Oklahoma\u2019s\nlaws prevent this \u201cunallocated water\u201d from being distrib-\nuted out of State, those laws violate the Commerce Clause.\n   Tarrant\u2019s assumption that that the Compact leaves\nsome water \u201cunallocated\u201d is incorrect. The interpretive\ncomment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that\nwhen the River\u2019s flow is above 3,000 CFS, \u201call states are\nfree to use whatever amount of water they can put to\nbeneficial use,\u201d subject to the requirement that \u201c[i]f the\nstates have competing uses and the amount of water\navailable in excess of 3000 CFS cannot satisfy all such\nuses, each state will honor the other\u2019s right to 25% of the\nexcess flow.\u201d 1 App. 29\u201330. If more than 25 percent of\nsubbasin 5\u2019s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is\nnot \u201cunallocated\u201d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\nunless and until another State calls for an accounting\nand Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than\nits entitled share.13 The Oklahoma water statutes can-\nnot discriminate against interstate commerce with re-\nspect to unallocated waters because the Compact leaves no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Moreover, even if Oklahoma utilized less than 25 percent of the\n\nexcess subbasin 5 water within its territory and allowed the rest to flow\ndown the River, that water would pass from Reach II into Reach V, see\nCompact \u00a72.12, 1 App. 13, the waters of which are completely allocated\nto Louisiana, \u00a78.01, id., at 38. Again, no water is left \u201cunallocated.\u201d\n24     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwaters unallocated.

Argued April 23, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nThe Red River Compact (or Compact) is a congressionally sanctioned\n  agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin\n  among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\n  The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called\n  \u201cReaches,\u201d each of which is further divided into smaller \u201csubbasins.\u201d\n  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Okla-\n  homa\u2019s portion of Reach II, subbasin 5. In Reach II, the Compact\u2014\n  recognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store wa-\n  ter during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas,\n  Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored\n  water for the benefit of a downstream State\u2014granted control over\n  the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the\n  States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a\n  fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain\n  minimum levels. Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States\n  \u201cequal rights\u201d to the use of subbasin 5\u2019s waters when the flow is 3,000\n  cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, \u201cprovided no state is entitled to\n  more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].\u201d Under\n  the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intra-\n  state water administration.\n     Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas\n  state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas\n  and its rapidly growing population. After unsuccessfully attempting\n  to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a wa-\n  ter resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board\n  (OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of\n  the Red River at a point located in Oklahoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5\n2        TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    of Reach II. Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit\n    application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent\n    out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within\n    Oklahoma\u2019s borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneous-\n    ly with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRB\u2019s enforce-\n    ment of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by\n    federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce\n    Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water. The\n    District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the\n    Tenth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n    1. The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.\n Pp. 9\u201322.\n       (a) Tarrant claims that \u00a75.05(b)(1) creates a borderless common\n in subbasin 5 in which each of the signatory States may cross each\n other\u2019s boundaries to access a shared pool of water. Tarrant observes\n that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal rights\u201d language grants each State an equal\n entitlement to subbasin 5\u2019s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and\n argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Com-\n pact\u2019s drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water accord-\n ing to state borders. The OWRB counters that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal\n rights\u201d afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5\u2019s ex-\n cess water within each State\u2019s own borders, but that its silence on\n cross-border rights indicates that the Compact\u2019s drafters had no in-\n tention to create any such rights in the signatory States. Pp. 9\u201311.\n       (b) Because interstate compacts are construed under contract-\n law principles, see Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 128, the Court\n begins by examining the Compact\u2019s express terms as the best indica-\n tion of the parties\u2019 intent. However, \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is, at the\n very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Com-\n pact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on\n the drafters\u2019 intent. Three things persuade the Court that the Com-\n pact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle\n that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that\n other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights ex-\n plicitly; and the parties\u2019 course of dealing. Pp. 11\u201322.\n         (1) The sovereign States possess an \u201cabsolute right to all their\n navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common\n use.\u201d Martin v.

So, for example,\n \u201c \u2018[a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water\n [within a State\u2019s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presump-\n tion\u2019 against defeat of a State\u2019s title.\u201d United States v. Alaska, 521\n U. S. 1, 34. It follows, then, that \u201c[i]f any inference at all is to be\n drawn from\u201d silence in compacts touching on the States\u2019 authority to\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67.\nTarrant contends that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence infers that the signatory\nStates dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water\nwithin its borders. But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign\npowers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indi-\ncation of such devolution, not inscrutable silence. Tarrant counters\nthat its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign preroga-\ntive of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the\nwater within its borders. But adopting Tarrant\u2019s reading would nec-\nessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States si-\nlently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they\nagreed to the Compact. Pp. 14\u201316.\n        (2) Looking to the customary practices employed in other inter-\nstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties\u2019 intent. See,\ne.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. 330, ___. Many compacts\nfeature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross\neach other\u2019s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and\nmany provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships\nwill operate. The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River\nCompact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never in-\ntended to be part of the agreement. Tarrant claims that not all inter-\nstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such\ncompact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to\nany contemplated diversions. Similarly, even if \u00a72.05(d) of the Com-\npact, which gives \u201c[e]ach Signatory State . . . the right to\u201d \u201c[u]se the\nbed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored\nwater, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according\nto this Compact,\u201d is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does\nso through express language, not through an inference from silence.\nPp. 16\u201320.\n        (3) The parties\u2019 conduct under the Compact also undermines\nTarrant\u2019s position. See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S., at ___.\nOnce the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed\nfor a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007. And Tar-\nrant\u2019s earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange\ndecision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water\nwithout payment. Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any oth-\ner Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of\ncross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signa-\ntory States has ever made such a claim. P. 20.\n        (4) Tarrant\u2019s remaining arguments\u2014that its interpretation is\nnecessary to realize the \u201cstructure and purpose of Reach II\u201d; and that\n\u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s 25 percent cap on each State\u2019s access to subbasin 5\u2019s ex-\n4         TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cess water implies that if a State cannot access sufficient water with-\n    in its borders to meet the cap, it must be able to cross borders to\n    reach that water\u2014are unpersuasive. Pp. 20\u201322.\n       2. The Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Com-\n    merce Clause. Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against\n    interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the\n    Compact from being distributed out of State. But Tarrant\u2019s assump-\n    tion that some water is left \u201cunallocated\u201d is incorrect. The interpre-\n    tive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the\n    flow is above 3,000 CFS, \u201call states are free to use whatever amount\n    of water they can put to beneficial use,\u201d subject to the requirement\n    that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses,\n    \u201ceach state will honor the other\u2019s right to 25% of the excess flow.\u201d If\n    more than 25 percent of subbasin 5\u2019s water is located in Oklahoma,\n    that water is not \u201cunallocated\u201d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\n    unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma\n    is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.\n    Pp. 22\u201324.\n656 F. 3d 1222, affirmed.\n\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                       Cite as: 569 U.

Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water\nDistrict (Tarrant), a Texas agency, claims that it is enti-\ntled to acquire water under the Compact from within\nOklahoma and that therefore the Compact pre-empts\nseveral Oklahoma statutes that restrict out-of-state diver-\nsions of water. In the alternative, Tarrant argues that the\nOklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on inter-\nstate commerce. We hold that Tarrant\u2019s claims lack merit.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Red River (or River) begins in the Llano Estacado\nMesa on the border between New Mexico and Texas.\nFrom this broad plain, it first runs through the Texas\nPanhandle and then marks the border between Texas and\nOklahoma. It continues in an easterly direction until it\nreaches the shared border with Arkansas. Once the River\n2     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nenters Arkansas, it turns southward and flows into Loui-\nsiana, where it empties into the Mississippi and Atchafa-\nlaya Rivers.\n   As an important geographic feature of this region, the\nRed River has lent its name to a valley, a Civil War cam-\npaign, and a famed college football rivalry between the\nLonghorns of Texas and the Sooners of Oklahoma. But\ncollege pride has not been the only source of controversy\nbetween Texas and Oklahoma regarding the Red River.\nThe River has been the cause of numerous historical con-\nflicts between the two States, leading to a mobilization of\ntheir militias at one time, Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S.\n574, 580 (1922), and the declaration of martial law along a\nstretch of the River by Oklahoma Governor \u201cAlfalfa Bill\u201d\nMurray at another, see Okla. H. Res. 1121, 50th Legisla-\nture, 2d Sess. (2006) (resolution commemorating \u201cAlfalfa\nBill\u201d Murray\u2019s actions during the \u201cRed River Bridge War\u201d).\nSuch disputes over the River and its waters are a natural\nresult of the River\u2019s distribution of water flows. The Riv-\ner\u2019s course means that upstream States like Oklahoma\nand Texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water\nfrom both the River and its tributaries to the disadvantage\nof downstream States like Arkansas and especially Lou-\nisiana, which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store\nwater.\n   Absent an agreement among the States, disputes over\nthe allocation of water are subject to equitable apportion-\nment by the courts, Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,\n609 (1983), which often results in protracted and costly\nlegal proceedings. Thus in 1955, to forestall future dis-\nputes over the River and its water, Congress authorized\nthe States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas\nto negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the Red\nRiver basin among themselves. See Act of Aug. 11, 1955,\nPub. L. 346, 69 Stat. 654. These negotiations lasted over\n20 years and finally culminated in the signing of the Red\n                   Cite as: 569 U.

See Act of Dec.\n22, 1980, 94 Stat. 3305; Compact, 1 App. 7\u201351.\n   One of the Compact\u2019s principal purposes was \u201c[t]o pro-\nvide an equitable apportionment among the Signatory\nStates of the water of the Red River and its tributaries.\u201d\n\u00a71.01(b), id., at 9.

This stretch is divided into\nfive separate subdivisions called \u201cReach[es],\u201d ibid., each of\nwhich is further divided into smaller \u201csubbasins,\u201d see, e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a75.01\u20135.05, id., at 22\u201326 (describing subbasins 1 through\n5 of Reach II). (See Appendix A, infra, for a map.)\n   At issue in this case are rights under the Compact to\nwater located in Oklahoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5 of\nReach II, which occupies \u201cthat portion of the Red River,\ntogether with its tributaries, from Denison Dam down to\nthe Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary, excluding all\ntributaries included in the other four subbasins of Reach\nII.\u201d \u00a75.05(a), 1 App. 24\u201325.

The Compact\u2019s interpretive comments1 explain that\nduring negotiations, Reach II posed the greatest difficulty\nto the parties\u2019 efforts to reach agreement. Comment on\nArt. V, 1 App. 27. The problem was that Louisiana, the\nfarthest downstream State, lacks suitable reservoir sites\nand therefore cannot store water during high flow periods\nto meet its future needs. The upstream States (Texas,\nOklahoma, and Arkansas), which control the River\u2019s flow,\nwere unwilling to release water stored within their own\nreservoirs for the benefit of any downstream States, like\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Interpretive\n               comments were included in the Compact so that future\nreaders \u201cmight be apprised of the intent of the Compact Negotiation\nCommittee with regard to each Article of the Compact.\u201d Compact,\nComment on Preamble, 1 App. 9.\n4       TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nLouisiana. Without any such release, there would be no\nguaranteed flow of water to Louisiana.\n  The provisions of the Compact relating to Reach II were\ncrafted to address this problem. To this end, Reach II was\ndivided into five subbasins. The upstream subbasins,\nnumbered 1 through 4, were drawn to end at \u201cexisting,\nauthorized or proposed last downstream major damsites,\u201d\nsee, e.g., \u00a75.01(a), id., at 22, on the tributaries leading to\nthe Red River before reaching the main stem of the River.\nThese dams allow the parties managing them to control\nwater along the tributaries before it travels farther down-\nstream and joins the flow of the main stem of the River.\nFor the most part, the Compact granted control over the\nwater in these subbasins to the States in which each\nsubbasin is located.2 The remaining subbasin, subbasin 5,\ninstead requires that water be allowed to flow to Louisi-\nana through the main stem of the River at certain mini-\nmum levels, assuring Louisiana an allocation of the River\u2019s\nwaters and solving its flowthrough problem.\n  The provision of the Compact central to the present\ndispute is \u00a75.05(b)(1), which sets the following allocation\nduring times of normal flow:\n       \u201c(1) The Signatory States shall have equal rights to\n     the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5 and un-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Within subbasins 1, 2, and 4, water was fully apportioned to a single\n\nState. See Compact \u00a75.01(b), id., at 22\u201323 (apportioning water of\nsubbasin 1 and its \u201cunrestricted use\u201d to Oklahoma); \u00a75.02(b), id., at 23\n(same for Texas with respect to subbasin 2); \u00a75.04(b), id., at 24 (same\nfor Texas with respect to subbasin 4). Only subbasin 3, which includes\nportions of Oklahoma and Arkansas, breaks from this pattern and was\ndivided along the lines of a 60-to-40 split, with both States having \u201cfree\nand unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respec-\ntive states, subject, however, to the limitation that Oklahoma shall\nallow a quantity of water equal to the 40 percent of the total runoff\noriginating below the following existing, authorized or proposed last\nmajor downstream damsites in Oklahoma to flow into Arkansas.\u201d\n\u00a75.03(b), id., at 23\u201324.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Dept.\nof Commerce, Census Bureau, P. Mackun & S. Wilson,\nPopulation Distribution and Change: 2000 to 2010 (Mar.\n2011). This growth has strained regional water supplies,\nand north Texas\u2019 need for water has been exacerbated in\nrecent years by a long and costly drought. See generally\nGalbraith, A Drought More Than Texas-Size, International\nHerald Tribune, Oct. 3, 2011, p. 4.\n  Against this backdrop, petitioner Tarrant, a Texas state\nagency responsible for providing water to north-central\nTexas (including the cities of Fort Worth, Arlington, and\nMansfield), has endeavored to secure new sources of water\nfor the area it serves. From 2000 to 2002, Tarrant, along\nwith several other Texas water districts, offered to pur-\nchase water from Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chicka-\nsaw Nations. See 2 App. 336\u2013382. But these negotiations\nwere unsuccessful and Tarrant eventually abandoned\nthese efforts.\n  Because Texas\u2019 need for water only continued to grow,\nTarrant settled on a new course of action. In 2007, Tar-\nrant sought a water resource permit from the Oklahoma\nWater Resources Board (OWRB),5 respondents here, to\ntake 310,000 acre feet6 per year of surface water from the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Under  \u00a72.10 of the Compact each signatory State retains \u201cthe right\nor power . . . to regulate within its boundaries the appropriation, use,\nand control of water.\u201d Id., at 12. Thus, the Compact does not expressly\npre-empt any state laws that address the control of water.

Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\n8       TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nKiamichi River, a tributary of the Red River located in\nOklahoma. Tarrant proposed to divert the Kiamichi River,\nat a point located in subbasin 5 of Reach II, before it dis-\ncharges into the Red River and, according to Tarrant, be-\ncomes too saline for potable use.\n  Tarrant knew, however, that Oklahoma would likely\ndeny its permits because various state laws (collectively,\nthe Oklahoma water statutes) effectively prevent out-of-\nstate applicants from taking or diverting water from within\nOklahoma\u2019s borders. These statutes include a require-\nment that the OWRB consider, when evaluating an appli-\ncation to take water out of State, whether that water\n\u201ccould feasibly be transported to alleviate water short-\nages in the State of Oklahoma.\u201d Okla. Stat., Tit. 82,\n\u00a7105.12(A)(5) (West 2013). The statutes also require that\nno permit issued by the OWRB to use water outside of the\nState shall \u201c[i]mpair the ability of the State of Oklahoma\nto meet its obligations under any interstate stream com-\npact.\u201d \u00a7105.12A(B)(1). A separate provision creates a\npermitting review process that applies only to out-of-\nstate water users. \u00a7105.12(F). Oklahoma also requires\nlegislative approval for out-of-state water-use permits,\n\u00a7105.12A(D), and further provides that \u201c[w]ater use within\nOklahoma . . . be developed to the maximum extent feasi-\nble for the benefit of Oklahoma so that out-of-state down-\nstream users will not acquire vested rights therein to the\ndetriment of the citizens of this state,\u201d \u00a71086.1(A)(3).\nInterpreting these laws, Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general has\nconcluded that \u201cwe consider the proposition unrealistic\nthat an out-of-state user is a proper permit applicant\nbefore the [OWRB]\u201d because \u201c[w]e can find no intention to\ncreate the possibility that such a valuable resource as\nwater may become bound, without compensation, to use by\nan out-of-state user.\u201d 1 App. 118.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntionary 19 (1966).\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

As\nrelevant here, Tarrant sought to enjoin enforcement of the\nOklahoma water statutes by the OWRB. Tarrant argued\nthat the statutes, and the interpretation of them adopted\nby Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, were pre-empted by\nfederal law and violated the Commerce Clause by discrim-\ninating against interstate commerce in water.\n  The District Court granted summary judgment for the\nOWRB on both of Tarrant\u2019s claims.

Brief for Peti-\ntioner 16.\n10      TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Tarrant\u2019s view, this provision essentially creates a\nborderless common in which each of the four signatory\nStates may cross each other\u2019s boundaries to access a\nshared pool of water. Tarrant reaches this interpretation\nin two steps. First, it observes that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cequal\nrights\u201d language grants each State an equal entitlement to\nthe waters of subbasin 5, subject to a 25 percent cap.\nSecond, Tarrant argues \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence concerning\nstate lines indicates that the Compact\u2019s drafters did not\nintend to allocate water according to state borders in this\nsection. According to Tarrant, \u201cthe \u201825 percent\u2019 language\n[of \u00a75.05(b)(1)] makes clear that, in exercising its \u2018equal\nrights\u2019 to the common pool of water, no State may take\nmore than a one-quarter share,\u201d Reply Brief 3, but any of\nthe signatory States may \u201ccross state lines to obtain [its]\nshar[e] of Subbasin 5 waters,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 32.\n   The OWRB disputes this reading. In its view, the\n\u201cequal rights\u201d promised by \u00a75.05(b)(1) afford each State an\nequal opportunity to make use of the excess water within\nsubbasin 5 of Reach II but only within each State\u2019s own\nborders. This is because the OWRB reads \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s\nsilence differently from Tarrant. The OWRB interprets\nthat provision\u2019s absence of language granting any cross-\nborder rights to indicate that the Compact\u2019s drafters had\nno intention to create any such rights in the signatory\nStates.\n   Unraveling the meaning of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence with\nrespect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the\nCompact pre-empts the Oklahoma water statutes.8 If\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The Compact Clause of the Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o State\n\nshall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or\nCompact with another State.\u201d Art. I, \u00a710, cl. 3. Accordingly, before a\ncompact between two States can be given effect it must be approved by\nCongress. See Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 66 (2003). Once a\ncompact receives such approval, it is \u201ctransform[ed] . . . into a law of\nthe United States.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                11\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence means that state borders are irrele-\nvant to the allocation of water in subbasin 5 of Reach II,\nthen the Oklahoma water laws at issue conflict with the\ncross-border rights created by federal law in the form of\nthe Compact and must be pre-empted. But if \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s\nsilence instead reflects a background understanding on\nthe part of the Compact\u2019s drafters that state borders were\nto be respected within the Compact\u2019s allocation, then the\nOklahoma statutes do not conflict with the Compact\u2019s\nallocation of water.\n                                B\n   Interstate compacts are construed as contracts under\nthe principles of contract law. Texas v. New Mexico, 482\nU. S. 124, 128 (1987). So, as with any contract, we begin\nby examining the express terms of the Compact as the\nbest indication of the intent of the parties, see also Mon-\ntana v. Wyoming, 563 U. S. ___, ___, and n. 4, ___, (2011)\n(slip op., at 5, and n. 4, 17); Restatement (Second) of Con-\ntracts \u00a7203(b) (1979).\n   Tarrant argues that because other provisions of the\nCompact reference state borders, \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence with\nrespect to state lines must mean that the Compact\u2019s draft-\ners intended to permit cross-border diversions. For exam-\nple, \u00a75.03(b), which governs subbasin 3 of Reach II,\nprovides that\n     \u201c[t]he States of Oklahoma and Arkansas shall have\n     free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin\n     within their respective states, subject, however, to the\n     limitation that Oklahoma shall allow a quantity of\n     water equal to . . . 40 percent of the total runoff origi-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSupremacy Clause, Art. VI, cl. 2, then ensures that a congressionally\napproved compact, as a federal law, pre-empts any state law that\nconflicts with the Compact. See Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De\nla Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 152\u2013153 (1982).\n12     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n     nating below the following existing, authorized or\n     proposed last major downstream damsites in Okla-\n     homa to flow into Arkansas.\u201d 1 App. 23\u201324 (emphasis\n     added).\nSection 6.03(b), which covers subbasin 3 of Reach III,\nsimilarly provides that \u201cTexas and Louisiana within their\nrespective boundaries shall each have the unrestricted use\nof the water of this subbasin subject to the following\n[conditions].\u201d Id., at 33 (emphasis added). Thus, \u00a75.03(b)\nand \u00a76.03(b) mimic \u00a75.05(b)(1) in allocating water rights\nwithin a subbasin, but differ in that they make explicit ref-\nerence to water use \u201cwithin\u201d state boundaries. Relying on\nthe expressio unius canon of construction, Tarrant finds\nthat \u00a75.05(b)\u2019s silence regarding borders is significant\nbecause \u201c \u2018[w]here Congress includes particular language\nin one section of a statute but omits it in another section of\nthe same Act, it is generally presumed [that] Congress\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\nor exclusion.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Petitioner 29 (quoting Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)).\n   But Tarrant\u2019s argument fails to account for other sec-\ntions of the Compact that cut against its reading. For\nexample, \u00a75.05(b)(3), which governs the waters of subbasin\n5 in Reach II when flows are below 1,000 CFS, requires\nthat during such periods, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma\nallow water \u201cwithin their respective states to flow into the\nRed River as required to maintain a 1,000 [CFS] flow at\nthe Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary.\u201d 1 App. 25 (em-\nphasis added). Obviously none of the upstream States can\nredirect water that lies outside of their borders, so the\nphrase \u201cwithin their respective states\u201d is superfluous in\n\u00a75.05(b)(3). In contrast, \u00a75.05(b)(2), which governs when\nthe River\u2019s flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana border is above\n1,000 CFS but below 3,000 CFS, requires that upstream\nStates allow a flow to Louisiana equivalent to 40 percent\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof total weekly runoff originating within the subbasin and\n40 percent of undesignated water flowing into subbasin 5\nof Reach II. Id., at 25. This language can only refer to\nwater within each State\u2019s borders because otherwise each\nState would have to contribute 40 percent to the total\nwater flow, which would add up to more than 100 percent.\nRead together and to avoid absurd results, \u00a7\u00a75.05(b)(2)\nand (3) suggest that each upstream State is individually\nresponsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin 5 water\nlocated within its respective borders flows down to Louisi-\nana, even though \u00a75.05(b)(2) lacks any explicit reference to\nstate lines.\n   Applying Tarrant\u2019s understanding of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s si-\nlence regarding state lines to other of the Compact\u2019s provi-\nsions would produce further anomalous results. Consider\n\u00a76.01(b). That provision states that \u201cTexas is apportioned\nsixty (60) percent of the runoff of [subbasin 1 of Reach III]\nand shall have unrestricted use thereof; Arkansas is enti-\ntled to forty (40) percent of the runoff of this subbasin.\u201d\nId., at 32. Because Texas is upstream from Arkansas,\nwater flows from Texas to Arkansas. Given this situation,\nthe commonsense reason for \u00a76.01(b)\u2019s 60-to-40 allocation\nis to prevent Texas from barring the flow of water to Ar-\nkansas. While there is no reference to state boundaries in\nthe section\u2019s text, the unstated assumption underlying this\nprovision is that Arkansas must wait for its 40 percent\nshare to go through Texas before it can claim it. But\napplying Tarrant\u2019s understanding of silence regarding\nstate borders to this section would imply that Arkansas\ncould enter into Texas without having to wait for the\nwater that will inevitably reach it. This counterintuitive\noutcome would thwart the self-evident purposes of the\nCompact. Further, other provisions of the Compact share\nthis structure of allocating a proportion of water that will\n14      TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nflow from an upstream State to a downstream one.9 Ac-\ncepting Tarrant\u2019s reading would upset the balance struck\nby all these sections.\n   At the very least, the problems that arise from Tarrant\u2019s\nproposed reading suggest that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is\nambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Com-\npact. We therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed\nlight on the intent of the Compact\u2019s drafters. See Okla-\nhoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 235, n. 5 (1991).10\nThree things persuade us that cross-border rights were\nnot granted by the Compact: the well-established principle\nthat States do not easily cede their sovereign powers,\nincluding their control over waters within their own terri-\ntories; the fact that other interstate water compacts have\ntreated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties\u2019\ncourse of dealing.\n                             1\n   The background notion that a State does not easily cede\nits sovereignty has informed our interpretation of inter-\nstate compacts. We have long understood that as sover-\neign entities in our federal system, the States possess an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 See Compact \u00a74.01(b), 1 App. 18 (\u201cThe annual flow within this sub-\n\nbasin is hereby apportioned sixty (60) percent to Texas and forty (40)\npercent to Oklahoma\u201d); \u00a76.02(b), id., at 32 (\u201cArkansas is apportioned\nsixty (60) percent of the runoff of this subbasin and shall have unre-\nstricted use thereof; Louisiana is entitled to forty (40) percent of the\nrunoff of this subbasin\u201d).\n  10 There is, however, one interpretive tool that is inapplicable here:\n\nthe presumption against pre-emption. The Court of Appeals repeatedly\nreferenced and relied upon the presumption in its opinion. See 656\nF. 3d 1222, 1239, 1242, 1245\u20131246 (CA10 2011). Yet the presumption\nagainst pre-emption is rooted in \u201crespect for the States as \u2018independent\nsovereigns in our federal system\u2019 \u201d and \u201cassume[s] that \u2018Congress does\nnot cavalierly pre-empt\u2019 \u201d state laws. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555,\n565\u2013566, n. 3 (2009). When the States themselves have drafted and\nagreed to the terms of a compact, and Congress\u2019 role is limited to\napproving that compact, there is no reason to invoke the presumption.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Drawing on this\nprinciple, we have held that ownership of submerged\nlands, and the accompanying power to control navigation,\nfishing, and other public uses of water, \u201cis an essen-\ntial attribute of sovereignty,\u201d United States v. Alaska,\n521 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Consequently, \u201c \u2018[a] court deciding\na question of title to [a] bed of navigable water [within a\nState\u2019s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presump-\ntion\u2019 against defeat of a State\u2019s title.\u201d Id., at 34 (quoting\nMontana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 552 (1981)). See\nalso Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army\nCorps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159, 174 (2001); Utah Div. of\nState Lands v. United States, 482 U. S. 193, 195 (1987).\n   Given these principles, when confronted with silence in\ncompacts touching on the States\u2019 authority to control their\nwaters, we have concluded that \u201c[i]f any inference at all is\nto be drawn from [such] silence on the subject of regula-\ntory authority, we think it is that each State was left to\nregulate the activities of her own citizens.\u201d Virginia v.\nMaryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67 (2003). Cf. New Jersey v. New\nYork, 523 U.

For example, those\nimposed by the Commerce Clause. See Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel.\nDouglas, 458 U. S. 941, 954\u2013958 (1982). Here we deal only with\nwhether the parties\u2019 silence on state boundaries in the allocation of\nwater under a compact suggests that borders are irrelevant for that\n16     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nstrates, States rarely relinquish their sovereign powers, so\nwhen they do we would expect a clear indication of such\ndevolution, not inscrutable silence. We think that the\nbetter understanding of \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s silence is that the\nparties drafted the Compact with this legal background in\nmind, and therefore did not intend to grant each other\ncross-border rights under the Compact.\n  In response, Tarrant contends that its interpretation\nwould not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Okla-\nhoma because that State would retain its authority to\nregulate the water within its borders. Because anyone\nseeking water from Oklahoma would still have to apply to\nthe OWRB, receive a permit, and abide by its conditions,\nTarrant argues that Oklahoma\u2019s sovereign authority\nremains untouched by its interpretation. But Tarrant\ncannot have it both ways. Adopting Tarrant\u2019s reading\nwould necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and\nthree other States silently surrendered substantial control\nover the water within their borders when they agreed to\nthe Compact. Given the background principles we have\ndescribed above, we find this unlikely to have been the\nintent of the Compact\u2019s signatories.\n                              2\n  Looking to the customary practices employed in other\ninterstate compacts also helps us to ascertain the intent of\nthe parties to this Compact. See Alabama v. North Carolina,\n560 U. S. 330 ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 9); Oklahoma,\n501 U. S., at 235, n. 5; Texas v. New Mexico, 462 U. S.\n554, 565 (1983).

HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncants from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana could all apply\nto the OWRB for permits to take water from Oklahoma.\nThe OWRB would then be obligated to determine the total\namount of water in Oklahoma beyond the 25 percent cap\ncreated in \u00a75.05(b)(1), given that the Compact would only\nobligate Oklahoma to deliver water beyond its quarter\nshare. This alone would be a herculean task because the\nCompact does not require ongoing monitoring or account-\ning, see Compact \u00a72.11, 1 App. 13, and not all of the water\nin subbasin 5 is located or originates in Oklahoma. More-\nover, the OWRB would be tasked with determining the\npriority under the Compact of applicants from other\nStates. This would almost certainly require the OWRB to\nnot only determine whether Oklahoma had received more\nor less than its 25 percent allotment, but whether other\nStates had as well. Put plainly, the end result would be\na jurisdictional and administrative quagmire. The pro-\nvisions in the other interstate water compacts resolve\nthese complications. The absence of comparable provisions\nin the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-\nborder rights were never intended to be part of the States\u2019\nagreement.\n  Tarrant counters that not all interstate compacts that\npermit cross-border diversions have explicit language to\nthis effect. On this front, Tarrant manages to identify one\ninterstate compact that it contends permits cross-border\ndiversions without express language to that effect, the\nUpper Niobrara River Compact, Pub. L. 91\u201352, 83 Stat.\n86. Tarrant observes that this compact, which deals with\na river mostly located in Nebraska with only a small\nportion in Wyoming, provides that \u201c[t]here shall be no\nrestrictions on the use of the surface waters of [the river]\nby Wyoming.\u201d See Art. V(A)1, id., at 88. Tarrant suggests\nthat this language, coupled with the fact that the bulk of\nthe river is in Nebraska, implicitly indicates that the\ncompact grants Wyoming a right to enter Nebraska and\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nuse the river\u2019s water. First, we are not convinced that a\nsingle compact\u2019s failure to reference state borders does\nmuch to detract from the overall custom in this area. See\nsupra, at 16\u201318, and n. 12. Second, the Upper Niobrara\nRiver Compact is not a helpful counterexample for Tar-\nrant. The general provision that Tarrant quotes is paired\nwith a host of detailed conditions. See Arts. V(A)1(a)\u2013(f),\n83 Stat. 88. Contrary to Tarrant\u2019s position, then, assum-\ning that the Upper Niobrara River compact does create\nany cross-border rights, it does so not through silence, but\nthrough the detailed scheme that would apply to any such\ncontemplated diversions.\n   Tarrant also argues that \u00a72.05(d) of the Red River Com-\npact, which provides that \u201c[e]ach Signatory State shall\nhave the right to\u201d \u201c[u]se the bed and banks of the Red\nRiver and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported\nor exported water, and water apportioned according to this\nCompact,\u201d 1 App. 11, in fact authorizes cross-border diver-\nsions. Because the present border between Texas and\nOklahoma east of the Texas Panhandle is set by the vege-\ntation line on the south bank of the River, Red River\nBoundary Compact, 114 Stat. 919, Tarrant contends that\n\u00a72.05(d) reflects an understanding on the part of the Com-\npact\u2019s drafters that state borders could be crossed. But the\nissue is not as simple as Tarrant makes it out to be. When\nthe Compact was drafted, the Texas-Oklahoma border was\nfixed at the south bank of the River. See Texas v. Okla-\nhoma, 457 U. S. 172 (1982). If Texas was able to access\nwater through the south bank of the River\u2014an issue left\nunbriefed by the parties\u2014the Compact\u2019s framers may\nhave believed that Texas could reach the River and take\nwater from it without having to enter Oklahoman land,\ncasting doubt on Tarrant\u2019s theory. In any event, even if\n\u00a72.05(d) is read to establish a cross-border right, it does so\nthrough express language setting forth the location and\npurposes under which such an incursion is permissible.\n20    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThis is different from the inference from silence that\nTarrant asks us to draw in \u00a75.05(b)(1).\n                             3\n   The parties\u2019 conduct under the Compact also under-\nmines Tarrant\u2019s position. A \u201cpart[y\u2019s] course of perfor-\nmance under the Compact is highly significant\u201d evidence\nof its understanding of the compact\u2019s terms. Alabama v.\nNorth Carolina, 560 U. S., at___ (slip op., at 14). Since the\nCompact was approved by Congress in 1980, no signatory\nState had pressed for a cross-border diversion under the\nCompact until Tarrant filed its suit in 2007. Brief for\nRespondents 26, 49\u201351. Indeed, Tarrant attempted to\npurchase water from Oklahoma over the course of 2000\nuntil 2002, see supra, at 7, a strange offer if Tarrant be-\nlieved it was entitled to demand such water without pay-\nment under the Compact.\n   In response, Tarrant maintains that there were \u201ccompel-\nling business reasons\u201d for it to purchase water. Reply\nBrief 17. We are unpersuaded. If Tarrant believed that it\nhad a right to water located in Oklahoma, there would\nhave been \u201ccompelling business reasons\u201d to mention this\nright given that billions of dollars were at stake. See 2\nApp. 362\u2013363 (summarizing Texas purchase proposal).\nYet there is no indication that Tarrant or any other Texas\nagency or the State of Texas itself previously made any\nmention of cross-border rights within the Compact, and\nnone of the other signatory States has ever made such a\nclaim.\n                            4\n  The Compact creates no cross-border rights in Texas.\nTarrant\u2019s remaining arguments do not persuade us\notherwise.\n  First, Tarrant argues that its interpretation of the\nCompact is necessary to realize the \u201cstructure and purpose\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof Reach II.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 34\u201338. Tarrant contends\nthat because the boundary of subbasin 5 is set by the\nlocation of the last existing, authorized, or proposed sites\nfor a downstream dam before the Red River, see Compact\n\u00a7\u00a75.01(a), 5.02(a), 5.03(b), 5.04(a), 1 App. 22\u201324, the Com-\npact allows each of the States upstream from Louisiana to\nprevent water from flowing from its tributaries into sub-\nbasin 5. Tarrant reasons that each State will therefore\nhold whatever water it needs in its upstream basins.\nGiven this, Tarrant maintains that any water that a State\nvoluntarily allows to reach subbasin 5 must be surplus\nwater that State did not intend to use, and if the upstream\nState has no need for that water, then there is no reason\nnot to allow other States to access and use it, even across\nborders.\n   This argument is founded on a shaky premise: It as-\nsumes that flows from these dammed-up tributaries are\nthe sole source of water in subbasin 5. But \u00a75.05(b)(1)\nexplains that \u201c[s]ignatory States shall have equal rights to\nthe use of runoff originating in subbasin 5,\u201d as well as\n\u201cwater flowing into subbasin 5,\u201d which would include flows\nfrom the main stem of the River itself. Id., at 25. Thus,\nthere are waters that are specific to subbasin 5 separate\nfrom those originating in the tributaries covered by sub-\nbasins 1 through 4. Tarrant\u2019s account of the purposes of\nsubbasin 5 does not explain how these waters were to be\nallocated.\n   Tarrant\u2019s second argument regarding the purposes of\nReach II is that \u00a75.05(b)(1)\u2019s 25 percent cap on each State\u2019s\naccess to excess water in subbasin 5 should be read to\nimply that if a State cannot access sufficient water within\nits borders to meet its share under the cap, then it must be\nable to cross borders to reach that water. Were it other-\nwise, Tarrant explains, the 25 percent cap would have no\npurpose. To support this argument, Tarrant draws on a\n1970 engineering report that it contends shows that only\n22    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\n16 percent of the freshwater flowing into subbasin 5 was\nlocated in Texas. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5. The OWRB\nchallenges this percentage with its own calculations\ndrawn from the report, and asserts that Texas had access\nto at least 29 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5\nwithin its own borders. Brief for Respondents 26, 47\u201348,\nand n. 17.\n  Fortunately, we need not delve into calculations based\non a decades-old engineering report to resolve this argu-\nment. As we have explained, supra, at 4\u20136, Texas does not\nhave a minimum guarantee of 25 percent of the excess\nwater in subbasin 5. If it believes that Oklahoma is using\nmore than its 25 percent allotment and wishes to stop it\nfrom doing so, then it may call for an accounting under\n\u00a72.11 of the Compact and, depending on the results of that\naccounting, insist that Oklahoma desist from taking more\nthan its provided share. See Compact \u00a72.11, and Com-\nment on Art. II, 1 App. 13\u201316. This is the appropriate\nremedy provided under the Compact. But Texas has never\ndone so and Tarrant offers no evidence that in the present\nday Texas cannot access its 25 percent share on its own\nland.\n                             C\n  Under the Compact\u2019s terms, water located within Okla-\nhoma\u2019s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II remains under\nOklahoma\u2019s control. Accordingly, Tarrant\u2019s theory that\nOklahoma\u2019s water statutes are pre-empted because they\nprevent Texas from exercising its rights under the Com-\npact must fail for the reason that the Compact does not\ncreate any cross-border rights in signatory States.\n                          III\n  Tarrant also challenges the constitutionality of the\nOklahoma water statutes under a dormant Commerce\nClause theory. Tarrant argues that the Oklahoma water\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Brief for Petitioner\n47\u201348 (quoting Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553\nU. S. 328, 338 (2008)). Tarrant\u2019s argument is premised on\nthe position that if we \u201cadopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s or re-\nspondent\u2019s interpretation [of the Compact], . . . a substan-\ntial amount of Reach II, Subbasin 5 water located in Ok-\nlahoma is not apportioned to any State and therefore is\navailable to permit applicants like Tarrant.\u201d Brief for\nPetitioner 47. So, Tarrant continues, because Oklahoma\u2019s\nlaws prevent this \u201cunallocated water\u201d from being distrib-\nuted out of State, those laws violate the Commerce Clause.\n   Tarrant\u2019s assumption that that the Compact leaves\nsome water \u201cunallocated\u201d is incorrect. The interpretive\ncomment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that\nwhen the River\u2019s flow is above 3,000 CFS, \u201call states are\nfree to use whatever amount of water they can put to\nbeneficial use,\u201d subject to the requirement that \u201c[i]f the\nstates have competing uses and the amount of water\navailable in excess of 3000 CFS cannot satisfy all such\nuses, each state will honor the other\u2019s right to 25% of the\nexcess flow.\u201d 1 App. 29\u201330. If more than 25 percent of\nsubbasin 5\u2019s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is\nnot \u201cunallocated\u201d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\nunless and until another State calls for an accounting\nand Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than\nits entitled share.13 The Oklahoma water statutes can-\nnot discriminate against interstate commerce with re-\nspect to unallocated waters because the Compact leaves no\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Moreover, even if Oklahoma utilized less than 25 percent of the\n\nexcess subbasin 5 water within its territory and allowed the rest to flow\ndown the River, that water would pass from Reach II into Reach V, see\nCompact \u00a72.12, 1 App. 13, the waters of which are completely allocated\nto Louisiana, \u00a78.01, id., at 38. Again, no water is left \u201cunallocated.\u201d\n24     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwaters unallocated.

We affirm the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
