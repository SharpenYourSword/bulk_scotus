Argued April 15, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nEach human gene is encoded as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which\n  takes the shape of a \u201cdouble helix.\u201d Each \u201ccross-bar\u201d in that helix\n  consists of two chemically joined nucleotides. Sequences of DNA nu-\n  cleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino\n  acids used to build proteins in the body. The nucleotides that code\n  for amino acids are \u201cexons,\u201d and those that do not are \u201cintrons.\u201d Sci-\n  entists can extract DNA from cells to isolate specific segments for\n  study. They can also synthetically create exons-only strands of nu-\n  cleotides known as composite DNA (cDNA). cDNA contains only the\n  exons that occur in DNA, omitting the intervening introns.\n     Respondent Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad), obtained several pa-\n  tents after discovering the precise location and sequence of the\n  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, mutations of which can dramatically in-\n  crease the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This knowledge allowed\n  Myriad to determine the genes\u2019 typical nucleotide sequence, which, in\n  turn, enabled it to develop medical tests useful for detecting muta-\n  tions in these genes in a particular patient to assess the patient\u2019s\n  cancer risk. If valid, Myriad\u2019s patents would give it the exclusive\n  right to isolate an individual\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and would\n  give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create BRCA cDNA.\n  Petitioners filed suit, seeking a declaration that Myriad\u2019s patents are\n  invalid under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. As relevant here, the District Court\n  granted summary judgment to petitioners, concluding that Myriad\u2019s\n  claims were invalid because they covered products of nature. The\n  Federal Circuit initially reversed, but on remand in light of Mayo\n  Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U. S. ___,\n  the Circuit found both isolated DNA and cDNA patent eligible.\n2        ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\nHeld: A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and\n not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA is\n patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. Pp. 10\u201318.\n    (a) The Patent Act permits patents to be issued to \u201c[w]hoever in-\n vents or discovers any new and useful . . . composition of matter,\u201d\n \u00a7101, but \u201claws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\u201d\n \u201c \u2018are basic tools of scientific and technological work\u2019 \u201d that lie beyond\n the domain of patent protection, Mayo, supra, at ___. The rule\n against patents on naturally occurring things has limits, however.\n Patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating \u201cincen-\n tives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery\u201d and \u201cimped[ing]\n the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.\u201d\n Id., at ___. This standard is used to determine whether Myriad\u2019s pa-\n tents claim a \u201cnew and useful . . . composition of matter,\u201d \u00a7101, or\n claim naturally occurring phenomena. Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) Myriad\u2019s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception.\n Myriad\u2019s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location\n and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v.\n Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry\n whether such action was new \u201cwith markedly different characteris-\n tics from any found in nature,\u201d id., at 310. Myriad did not create or\n alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and\n BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an im-\n portant and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even\n brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the \u00a7101 inquiry. See\n Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127. Finding\n the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes does not render the\n genes patent eligible \u201cnew . . . composition[s] of matter,\u201d \u00a7101. Myri-\n ad\u2019s patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims: They\n detail the extensive process of discovery, but extensive effort alone is\n insufficient to satisfy \u00a7101\u2019s demands. Myriad\u2019s claims are not saved\n by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the\n chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together. The claims are\n not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely on\n the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA\n section. Instead, they focus on the genetic information encoded in the\n BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Finally, Myriad argues that the Patent\n and Trademark Office\u2019s past practice of awarding gene patents is en-\n titled to deference, citing J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred\n Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, a case where Congress had endorsed a PTO\n practice in subsequent legislation. There has been no such endorse-\n ment here, and the United States argued in the Federal Circuit and\n in this Court that isolated DNA was not patent eligible under \u00a7101.\n Pp. 12\u201316.\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n     (c) cDNA is not a \u201cproduct of nature,\u201d so it is patent eligible under\n  \u00a7101. cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as\n  naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. Its creation results in\n  an exons-only molecule, which is not naturally occurring. Its order of\n  the exons may be dictated by nature, but the lab technician unques-\n  tionably creates something new when introns are removed from a\n  DNA sequence to make cDNA. Pp. 16\u201317.\n     (d) This case, it is important to note, does not involve method\n  claims, patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1\n  and BRCA2 genes, or the patentability of DNA in which the order of\n  the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered.

(Myriad), discovered\nthe precise location and sequence of two human genes,\nmutations of which can substantially increase the risks of\nbreast and ovarian cancer. Myriad obtained a number\nof patents based upon its discovery. This case involves\nclaims from three of them and requires us to resolve\nwhether a naturally occurring segment of deoxyribonucleic\nacid (DNA) is patent eligible under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 by\nvirtue of its isolation from the rest of the human genome.\nWe also address the patent eligibility of synthetically\ncreated DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA), which\ncontains the same protein-coding information found in\na segment of natural DNA but omits portions within the\nDNA segment that do not code for proteins. For the rea-\nsons that follow, we hold that a naturally occurring DNA\nsegment is a product of nature and not patent eligible\nmerely because it has been isolated, but that cDNA is\npatent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. We,\ntherefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of\n2      ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   Genes form the basis for hereditary traits in living\norganisms. See generally Association for Molecular Pa-\nthology v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, 702\nF. Supp. 2d 181, 192\u2013211 (SDNY 2010). The human ge-\nnome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into\n23 pairs of chromosomes. Each gene is encoded as DNA,\nwhich takes the shape of the familiar \u201cdouble helix\u201d\nthat Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first de-\nscribed in 1953. Each \u201ccross-bar\u201d in the DNA helix con-\nsists of two chemically joined nucleotides. The possible\nnucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and\nguanine (G), each of which binds naturally with another\nnucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. The nucleotide\ncross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate\nbackbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA\nhelix. Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the infor-\nmation necessary to create strings of amino acids, which\nin turn are used in the body to build proteins. Only some\nDNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these\nnucleotides are known as \u201cexons.\u201d Nucleotides that do not\ncode for amino acids, in contrast, are known as \u201cintrons.\u201d\n   Creation of proteins from DNA involves two principal\nsteps, known as transcription and translation. In tran-\nscription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate,\nand the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands. A\nsingle strand is used as a template to create a complemen-\ntary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The nucleotides on the\nDNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with\nthe exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U)\ninstead of thymine (T). Transcription results in a single\nstrand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleo-\ntides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit was created. Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corre-\nsponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA mole-\ncule. The pre-RNA is then naturally \u201cspliced\u201d by the\nphysical removal of the introns. The resulting product is a\nstrand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding\nonly to the exons from the original DNA strand. The\nexons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA),\nwhich creates amino acids through translation. In trans-\nlation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each\nset of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA.\nEach codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20\npossible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop\nsignal that ends amino acid production.\n   DNA\u2019s informational sequences and the processes that\ncreate mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally\nwithin cells. Scientists can, however, extract DNA from\ncells using well known laboratory methods. These meth-\nods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA\u2014\nfor instance, a particular gene or part of a gene\u2014which\ncan then be further studied, manipulated, or used. It is also\npossible to create DNA synthetically through processes\nsimilarly well known in the field of genetics. One such\nmethod begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the\nnatural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new,\nsynthetic DNA molecule. The result is the inverse of the\nmRNA\u2019s inverse image of the original DNA, with one\nimportant distinction: Because the natural creation of\nmRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic\nDNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon\nsequences. This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory\nfrom mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).\n   Changes in the genetic sequence are called mutations.\nMutations can be as small as the alteration of a single\nnucleotide\u2014a change affecting only one letter in the genetic\ncode. Such small-scale changes can produce an entirely\ndifferent amino acid or can end protein production alto-\n4      ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngether. Large changes, involving the deletion, rearrange-\nment, or duplication of hundreds or even millions of nu-\ncleotides, can result in the elimination, misplacement, or\nduplication of entire genes. Some mutations are harmless,\nbut others can cause disease or increase the risk of dis-\nease. As a result, the study of genetics can lead to valu-\nable medical breakthroughs.\n                             B\n   This case involves patents filed by Myriad after it made\none such medical breakthrough. Myriad discovered the\nprecise location and sequence of what are now known as\nthe BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations in these genes\ncan dramatically increase an individual\u2019s risk of develop-\ning breast and ovarian cancer. The average American\nwoman has a 12- to 13-percent risk of developing breast\ncancer, but for women with certain genetic mutations, the\nrisk can range between 50 and 80 percent for breast can-\ncer and between 20 and 50 percent for ovarian cancer.\nBefore Myriad\u2019s discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in estab-\nlishing a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast and ovarian\ncancer, but they did not know which genes were associated\nwith those cancers.\n   Myriad identified the exact location of the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes on chromosomes 17 and 13. Chromosome\n17 has approximately 80 million nucleotides, and chro-\nmosome 13 has approximately 114 million. Association\nfor Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trade-\nmark Office, 689 F. 3d 1303, 1328 (CA Fed. 2012). Within\nthose chromosomes, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are\neach about 80,000 nucleotides long. If just exons are\ncounted, the BRCA1 gene is only about 5,500 nucleotides\nlong; for the BRCA2 gene, that number is about 10,200.\nIbid. Knowledge of the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes allowed Myriad to determine their typical nucleotide\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsequence.1 That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to\ndevelop medical tests that are useful for detecting muta-\ntions in a patient\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby\nassessing whether the patient has an increased risk of\ncancer.\n   Once it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1\nand BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number\nof patents. Nine composition claims from three of those\npatents are at issue in this case.2 See id., at 1309, and\nn. 1 (noting composition claims). Claims 1, 2, 5, and 6\nfrom the \u2019282 patent are representative. The first claim\nasserts a patent on \u201c[a]n isolated DNA coding for a BRCA1\npolypeptide,\u201d which has \u201cthe amino acid sequence set forth\nin SEQ ID NO:2.\u201d App. 822. SEQ ID NO:2 sets forth a list\nof 1,863 amino acids that the typical BRCA1 gene encodes.\nSee id., at 785\u2013790. Put differently, claim 1 asserts a\npatent claim on the DNA code that tells a cell to produce\nthe string of BRCA1 amino acids listed in SEQ ID NO:2.\n   Claim 2 of the \u2019282 patent operates similarly. It claims\n\u201c[t]he isolated DNA of claim 1, wherein said DNA has the\nnucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.\u201d Id., at\n822. Like SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a\nlong list of data, in this instance the sequence of cDNA that\ncodes for the BRCA1 amino acids listed in claim 1. Im-\nportantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the\nBRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence contain-\ning both exons and introns. See id., at 779 (stating that\nSEQ ID NO:1\u2019s \u201cMOLECULE TYPE:\u201d is \u201ccDNA\u201d). As a re-\nsult, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a\npatent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Technically, there is no \u201ctypical\u201d gene because nucleotide sequences\n\nvary between individuals, sometimes dramatically. Geneticists refer to\nthe most common variations of genes as \u201cwild types.\u201d\n  2 At issue are claims 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7 of U. S. Patent 5,747,282 (the\n\n\u2019282 patent), claim 1 of U. S. Patent 5,693,473 (the \u2019473 patent), and\nclaims 1, 6, and 7 of U. S. Patent 5,837,492 (the \u2019492 patent).\n6       ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                 MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nNO:1, which codes for the typical BRCA1 gene. 689 F. 3d,\nat 1326, n. 9; id., at 1337 (Moore, J., concurring in part);\nid., at 1356 (Bryson, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part).\n   Claim 5 of the \u2019282 patent claims a subset of the data in\nclaim 1. In particular, it claims \u201c[a]n isolated DNA having\nat least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 1.\u201d App. 822.\nThe practical effect of claim 5 is to assert a patent on any\nseries of 15 nucleotides that exist in the typical BRCA1\ngene. Because the BRCA1 gene is thousands of nucleo-\ntides long, even BRCA1 genes with substantial mutations\nare likely to contain at least one segment of 15 nucleotides\nthat correspond to the typical BRCA1 gene. Similarly,\nclaim 6 of the \u2019282 patent claims \u201c[a]n isolated DNA hav-\ning at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 2.\u201d Ibid.\nThis claim operates similarly to claim 5, except that it\nreferences the cDNA-based claim 2. The remaining claims\nat issue are similar, though several list common mutations\nrather than typical BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences. See\nibid. (claim 7 of the \u2019282 patent); id., at 930 (claim 1 of the\n\u2019473 patent); id., at 1028 (claims 1, 6, and 7 of the \u2019492\npatent).\n                               C\n  Myriad\u2019s patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive\nright to isolate an individual\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes\n(or any strand of 15 or more nucleotides within the genes)\nby breaking the covalent bonds that connect the DNA to\nthe rest of the individual\u2019s genome. The patents would\nalso give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create\nBRCA cDNA. In Myriad\u2019s view, manipulating BRCA DNA\nin either of these fashions triggers its \u201cright to exclude\nothers from making\u201d its patented composition of matter\nunder the Patent Act. 35 U. S. C. \u00a7154(a)(1); see also\n\u00a7271(a) (\u201c[W]hoever without authority makes . . . any\npatented invention . . . infringes the patent\u201d).\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   But isolation is necessary to conduct genetic testing, and\nMyriad was not the only entity to offer BRCA testing after\nit discovered the genes. The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nGenetic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided\ngenetic testing services to women. Petitioner Dr. Harry\nOstrer, then a researcher at New York University School\nof Medicine, routinely sent his patients\u2019 DNA samples to\nGDL for testing. After learning of GDL\u2019s testing and\nOstrer\u2019s activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting\nthat the genetic testing infringed Myriad\u2019s patents. App.\n94\u201395 (Ostrer letter). In response, GDL agreed to stop\ntesting and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept\npatient samples. Myriad also filed patent infringement\nsuits against other entities that performed BRCA testing,\nresulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to\ncease all allegedly infringing activity. 689 F. 3d, at 1315.\nMyriad, thus, solidified its position as the only entity\nproviding BRCA testing.\n   Some years later, petitioner Ostrer, along with medical\npatients, advocacy groups, and other doctors, filed this\nlawsuit seeking a declaration that Myriad\u2019s patents are\ninvalid under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. 702 F. Supp. 2d, at 186.\nCiting this Court\u2019s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen-\ntech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118 (2007), the District Court denied\nMyriad\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of standing. Associa-\ntion for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and\nTrademark Office, 669 F. Supp. 2d 365, 385\u2013392 (SDNY\n2009). The District Court then granted summary judg-\nment to petitioners on the composition claims at issue in\nthis case based on its conclusion that Myriad\u2019s claims,\nincluding claims related to cDNA, were invalid because\nthey covered products of nature. 702 F. Supp. 2d, at 220\u2013\n237. The Federal Circuit reversed, Association for Molecu-\nlar Pathology v.

S. ___ (2012).\nSee Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genet-\nics, Inc., 566 U. S. ___ (2012).\n   On remand, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt in part and reversed in part, with each member of\nthe panel writing separately. All three judges agreed\nthat only petitioner Ostrer had standing. They reasoned\nthat Myriad\u2019s actions against him and his stated ability\nand willingness to begin BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing if Myr-\niad\u2019s patents were invalidated were sufficient for Article III\nstanding. 689 F. 3d, at 1323; id., at 1337 (opinion of\nMoore, J.); id., at 1348 (opinion of Bryson, J.).\n   With respect to the merits, the court held that both\nisolated DNA and cDNA were patent eligible under \u00a7101.\nThe central dispute among the panel members was\nwhether the act of isolating DNA\u2014separating a specific\ngene or sequence of nucleotides from the rest of the\nchromosome\u2014is an inventive act that entitles the individ-\nual who first isolates it to a patent. Each of the judges on\nthe panel had a different view on that question. Judges\nLourie and Moore agreed that Myriad\u2019s claims were patent\neligible under \u00a7101 but disagreed on the rationale. Judge\nLourie relied on the fact that the entire DNA molecule is\nheld together by chemical bonds and that the covalent\nbonds at both ends of the segment must be severed in\norder to isolate segments of DNA. This process technically\ncreates new molecules with unique chemical compositions.\nSee id., at 1328 (\u201cIsolated DNA . . . is a free-standing\nportion of a larger, natural DNA molecule. Isolated DNA\nhas been cleaved (i.e., had covalent bonds in its backbone\nchemically severed) or synthesized to consist of just a\nfraction of a naturally occurring DNA molecule\u201d). Judge\nLourie found this chemical alteration to be dispositive,\nbecause isolating a particular strand of DNA creates\na nonnaturally occurring molecule, even though the\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchemical alteration does not change the information-\ntransmitting quality of the DNA. See id., at 1330 (\u201cThe\nclaimed isolated DNA molecules are distinct from their\nnatural existence as portions of larger entities, and their\ninformational content is irrelevant to that fact. We recog-\nnize that biologists may think of molecules in terms of\ntheir uses, but genes are in fact materials having a chemi-\ncal nature\u201d). Accordingly, he rejected petitioners\u2019 argument\nthat isolated DNA was ineligible for patent protection\nas a product of nature.\n   Judge Moore concurred in part but did not rely exclu-\nsively on Judge Lourie\u2019s conclusion that chemically break-\ning covalent bonds was sufficient to render isolated DNA\npatent eligible. Id., at 1341 (\u201cTo the extent the majority\nrests its conclusion on the chemical differences between\n[naturally occurring] and isolated DNA (breaking the\ncovalent bonds), I cannot agree that this is sufficient to\nhold that the claims to human genes are directed to pa-\ntentable subject matter\u201d). Instead, Judge Moore also\nrelied on the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s\n(PTO) practice of granting such patents and on the reli-\nance interests of patent holders. Id., at 1343. However,\nshe acknowledged that her vote might have come out\ndifferently if she \u201cwere deciding this case on a blank can-\nvas.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, Judge Bryson concurred in part and dissented\nin part, concluding that isolated DNA is not patent eli-\ngible. As an initial matter, he emphasized that the break-\ning of chemical bonds was not dispositive: \u201c[T]here is no magic\nto a chemical bond that requires us to recognize a new prod-\nuct when a chemical bond is created or broken.\u201d Id.,\nat 1351. Instead, he relied on the fact that \u201c[t]he nucleo-\ntide sequences of the claimed molecules are the same as\nthe nucleotide sequences found in naturally occurring\nhuman genes.\u201d Id., at 1355. Judge Bryson then concluded\nthat genetic \u201cstructural similarity dwarfs the significance\n10        ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n\n                   MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof the structural differences between isolated DNA and\nnaturally occurring DNA, especially where the structural\ndifferences are merely ancillary to the breaking of covalent\nbonds, a process that is itself not inventive.\u201d Ibid. More-\nover, Judge Bryson gave no weight to the PTO\u2019s position\non patentability because of the Federal Circuit\u2019s position\nthat \u201cthe PTO lacks substantive rulemaking authority as\nto issues such as patentability.\u201d Id., at 1357.\n  Although the judges expressed different views concern-\ning the patentability of isolated DNA, all three agreed that\npatent claims relating to cDNA met the patent eligibility\nrequirements of \u00a7101.

Rather, \u201c \u2018they are the basic tools of\nscientific and technological work\u2019 \u201d that lie beyond the\ndomain of patent protection. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As\nthe Court has explained, without this exception, there\nwould be considerable danger that the grant of patents\nwould \u201ctie up\u201d the use of such tools and thereby \u201cinhibit\nfuture innovation premised upon them.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). This would be at odds with the very point\nof patents, which exist to promote creation. Diamond v.\nChakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980) (Products of na-\nture are not created, and \u201c \u2018manifestations . . . of nature\n[are] free to all men and reserved exclusively to none\u2019 \u201d).\n   The rule against patents on naturally occurring things\nis not without limits, however, for \u201call inventions at some\nlevel embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of\nnature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas,\u201d and \u201ctoo\nbroad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle\ncould eviscerate patent law.\u201d 566 U.

As we have recognized before, patent protection strikes\na delicate balance between creating \u201cincentives that lead\nto creation, invention, and discovery\u201d and \u201cimped[ing] the\nflow of information that might permit, indeed spur, in-\nvention.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). We must apply this\nwell-established standard to determine whether Myr-\niad\u2019s patents claim any \u201cnew and useful . . . composition\nof matter,\u201d \u00a7101, or instead claim naturally occurring\nphenomena.\n                            B\n  It is undisputed that Myriad did not create or alter any\nof the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and\n12     ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBRCA2 genes. The location and order of the nucleotides\nexisted in nature before Myriad found them. Nor did Myr-\niad create or alter the genetic structure of DNA. In-\nstead, Myriad\u2019s principal contribution was uncovering the\nprecise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1\nand BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13. The\nquestion is whether this renders the genes patentable.\n   Myriad recognizes that our decision in Chakrabarty is\ncentral to this inquiry. Brief for Respondents 14, 23\u201327.\nIn Chakrabarty, scientists added four plasmids to a bacte-\nrium, which enabled it to break down various components\nof crude oil. 447 U. S., at 305, and n. 1. The Court held\nthat the modified bacterium was patentable. It explained\nthat the patent claim was \u201cnot to a hitherto unknown\nnatural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring\nmanufacture or composition of matter\u2014a product of hu-\nman ingenuity \u2018having a distinctive name, character [and]\nuse.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 309\u2013310 (quoting Hartranft v. Wiegmann,\n121 U. S. 609, 615 (1887); alteration in original). The\nChakrabarty bacterium was new \u201cwith markedly different\ncharacteristics from any found in nature,\u201d 447 U. S., at\n310, due to the additional plasmids and resultant \u201ccapac-\nity for degrading oil.\u201d Id., at 305, n. 1. In this case, by\ncontrast, Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it\nfound an important and useful gene, but separating that\ngene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of\ninvention.\n   Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery\ndoes not by itself satisfy the \u00a7101 inquiry. In Funk Broth-\ners Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127 (1948),\nthis Court considered a composition patent that claimed a\nmixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that\nhelped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and\nfix it in the soil. Id., at 128\u2013129. The ability of the bacte-\nria to fix nitrogen was well known, and farmers commonly\n\u201cinoculated\u201d their crops with them to improve soil nitrogen\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlevels. But farmers could not use the same inoculant for\nall crops, both because plants use different bacteria and\nbecause certain bacteria inhibit each other. Id., at 129\u2013\n130. Upon learning that several nitrogen-fixing bacteria\ndid not inhibit each other, however, the patent applicant\ncombined them into a single inoculant and obtained a\npatent. Id., at 130. The Court held that the composition\nwas not patent eligible because the patent holder did not\nalter the bacteria in any way. Id., at 132 (\u201cThere is no\nway in which we could call [the bacteria mixture a product\nof invention] unless we borrowed invention from the dis-\ncovery of the natural principle itself \u201d). His patent claim\nthus fell squarely within the law of nature exception. So\ndo Myriad\u2019s. Myriad found the location of the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render\nthe BRCA genes \u201cnew . . . composition[s] of matter,\u201d \u00a7101,\nthat are patent eligible.\n  Indeed, Myriad\u2019s patent descriptions highlight the\nproblem with its claims. For example, a section of the \u2019282\npatent\u2019s Detailed Description of the Invention indicates\nthat Myriad found the location of a gene associated with\nincreased risk of breast cancer and identified mutations of\nthat gene that increase the risk. See App. 748\u2013749.4 In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  full relevant text of the Detailed Description of the Patent is as\nfollows:\n   \u201cIt is a discovery of the present invention that the BRCA1 locus\nwhich predisposes individuals to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, is a\ngene encoding a BRCA1 protein, which has been found to have no\nsignificant homology with known protein or DNA sequences. . . . It is a\ndiscovery of the present invention that mutations in the BRCA1 locus\nin the germline are indicative of a predisposition to breast cancer and\novarian cancer. Finally, it is a discovery of the present invention that\nsomatic mutations in the BRCA1 locus are also associated with breast\ncancer, ovarian cancer and other cancers, which represents an indicator\nof these cancers or of the prognosis of these cancers. The mutational\nevents of the BRCA1 locus can involve deletions, insertions and point\nmutations.\u201d App. 749.\n14       ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsubsequent language Myriad explains that the location of\nthe gene was unknown until Myriad found it among the\napproximately eight million nucleotide pairs contained in\na subpart of chromosome 17. See Ibid.5 The \u2019473 and \u2019492\npatents contain similar language as well. See id., at 854,\n947. Many of Myriad\u2019s patent descriptions simply detail\nthe \u201citerative process\u201d of discovery by which Myriad nar-\nrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it\nsought.6 See, e.g., id., at 750. Myriad seeks to import\nthese extensive research efforts into the \u00a7101 patent-\neligibility inquiry. Brief for Respondents 8\u201310, 34. But\nextensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands\nof \u00a7101.\n   Nor are Myriad\u2019s claims saved by the fact that isolating\nDNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and\nthereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule. Myr-\niad\u2019s claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical\ncomposition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemi-\ncal changes that result from the isolation of a particular\nsection of DNA. Instead, the claims understandably focus\non the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Notwithstanding Myriad\u2019s repeated use of the phrase \u201cpresent\ninvention,\u201d it is clear from the text of the patent that the various\ndiscoveries are the \u201cinvention.\u201d\n  5 \u201cStarting from a region on the long arm of human chromosome 17 of\n\nthe human genome, 17q, which has a size estimated at about 8 million\nbase pairs, a region which contains a genetic locus, BRCA1, which\ncauses susceptibility to cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer,\nhas been identified.\u201d Ibid.\n  6 Myriad first identified groups of relatives with a history of breast\n\ncancer (some of whom also had developed ovarian cancer); because\nthese individuals were related, scientists knew that it was more likely\nthat their diseases were the result of genetic predisposition rather than\nother factors. Myriad compared sections of their chromosomes, looking\nfor shared genetic abnormalities not found in the general population. It\nwas that process which eventually enabled Myriad to determine where\nin the genetic sequence the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes reside. See, e.g.,\nid., at 749, 763\u2013775.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBRCA2 genes. If the patents depended upon the creation\nof a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could\narguably avoid at least Myriad\u2019s patent claims on entire\ngenes (such as claims 1 and 2 of the \u2019282 patent) by isolat-\ning a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or\nBRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair. Such a\nmolecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule\n\u201cinvented\u201d by Myriad. But Myriad obviously would resist\nthat outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with\nthe information contained in the genetic sequence, not\nwith the specific chemical composition of a particular\nmolecule.\n   Finally, Myriad argues that the PTO\u2019s past practice of\nawarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing\nJ. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534\nU. S. 124 (2001). See Brief for Respondents 35\u201339, 49\u201350.\nWe disagree. J. E. M. held that new plant breeds were\neligible for utility patents under \u00a7101 notwithstanding\nseparate statutes providing special protections for plants,\nsee 7 U. S. C. \u00a72321 et seq. (Plant Variety Protection Act);\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161\u2013164 (Plant Patent Act of 1930). After\nanalyzing the text and structure of the relevant statutes,\nthe Court mentioned that the Board of Patent Appeals and\nInterferences had determined that new plant breeds were\npatent eligible under \u00a7101 and that Congress had recog-\nnized and endorsed that position in a subsequent Patent\nAct amendment. 534 U. S., at 144\u2013145 (citing In re Hib-\nberd, 227 USPQ 443 (1985) and 35 U. S. C. \u00a7119(f)). In\nthis case, however, Congress has not endorsed the views of\nthe PTO in subsequent legislation. While Myriad relies on\nJudge Moore\u2019s view that Congress endorsed the PTO\u2019s\nposition in a single sentence in the Consolidated Appro-\npriations Act of 2004, see Brief for Respondents 31, n. 8;\n689 F. 3d, at 1346, that Act does not even mention genes,\nmuch less isolated DNA. \u00a7634, 118 Stat. 101 (\u201cNone of the\nfunds appropriated or otherwise made available under this\n16       ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nAct may be used to issue patents on claims directed to or\nencompassing a human organism\u201d).\n  Further undercutting the PTO\u2019s practice, the United\nStates argued in the Federal Circuit and in this Court that\nisolated DNA was not patent eligible under \u00a7101, Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20\u201333, and that the\nPTO\u2019s practice was not \u201ca sufficient reason to hold that\nisolated DNA is patent-eligible.\u201d Id., at 26. See also id.,\nat 28\u201329. These concessions weigh against deferring to\nthe PTO\u2019s determination.7\n                            C\n   cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentabil-\nity as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. As\nalready explained, creation of a cDNA sequence from\nmRNA results in an exons-only molecule that is not natu-\nrally occurring.8 Petitioners concede that cDNA differs\nfrom natural DNA in that \u201cthe non-coding regions have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Myriad  also argues that we should uphold its patents so as not to\ndisturb the reliance interests of patent holders like itself. Brief for\nRespondents 38\u201339. Concerns about reliance interests arising from\nPTO determinations, insofar as they are relevant, are better directed to\nCongress. See Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories,\nInc., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 22\u201324).\n   8 Some viruses rely on an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to re-\n\nproduce by copying RNA into cDNA. In rare instances, a side effect of\na viral infection of a cell can be the random incorporation of fragments\nof the resulting cDNA, known as a pseudogene, into the genome. Such\npseudogenes serve no purpose; they are not expressed in protein\ncreation because they lack genetic sequences to direct protein expres-\nsion. See J. Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene 142, 144, fig.\n7\u20135 (6th ed. 2008). Perhaps not surprisingly, given pseudogenes\u2019\napparently random origins, petitioners \u201chave failed to demonstrate that\nthe pseudogene consists of the same sequence as the BRCA1 cDNA.\u201d\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and\nTrademark Office, 689 F. 3d 1303, 1356, n. 5 (CA Fed. 2012). The\npossibility that an unusual and rare phenomenon might randomly\ncreate a molecule similar to one created synthetically through human\ningenuity does not render a composition of matter nonpatentable.\n                    Cite as: 569 U.

They neverthe-\nless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because \u201c[t]he\nnucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by\nthe lab technician.\u201d Id., at 51. That may be so, but the lab\ntechnician unquestionably creates something new when\ncDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring\nexons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which\nit was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a \u201cproduct of\nnature\u201d and is patent eligible under \u00a7101, except insofar\nas very short series of DNA may have no intervening\nintrons to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation,\na short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from\nnatural DNA.9\n                            III\n  It is important to note what is not implicated by this\ndecision. First, there are no method claims before this\nCourt. Had Myriad created an innovative method of\nmanipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method pat-\nent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA\nwere well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad\u2019s\npatents \u201cwere well understood, widely used, and fairly\nuniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for\na gene would likely have utilized a similar approach,\u201d 702\nF. Supp. 2d, at 202\u2013203, and are not at issue in this case.\n  Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new\napplications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, \u201c[a]s the first party\nwith knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences,\nMyriad was in an excellent position to claim applications\nof that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 We express no opinion whether cDNA satisfies the other statutory\n\nrequirements of patentability. See, e.g., 35 U. S.

Argued April 15, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nEach human gene is encoded as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which\n  takes the shape of a \u201cdouble helix.\u201d Each \u201ccross-bar\u201d in that helix\n  consists of two chemically joined nucleotides. Sequences of DNA nu-\n  cleotides contain the information necessary to create strings of amino\n  acids used to build proteins in the body. The nucleotides that code\n  for amino acids are \u201cexons,\u201d and those that do not are \u201cintrons.\u201d Sci-\n  entists can extract DNA from cells to isolate specific segments for\n  study. They can also synthetically create exons-only strands of nu-\n  cleotides known as composite DNA (cDNA). cDNA contains only the\n  exons that occur in DNA, omitting the intervening introns.\n     Respondent Myriad Genetics, Inc. (Myriad), obtained several pa-\n  tents after discovering the precise location and sequence of the\n  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, mutations of which can dramatically in-\n  crease the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. This knowledge allowed\n  Myriad to determine the genes\u2019 typical nucleotide sequence, which, in\n  turn, enabled it to develop medical tests useful for detecting muta-\n  tions in these genes in a particular patient to assess the patient\u2019s\n  cancer risk. If valid, Myriad\u2019s patents would give it the exclusive\n  right to isolate an individual\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, and would\n  give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create BRCA cDNA.\n  Petitioners filed suit, seeking a declaration that Myriad\u2019s patents are\n  invalid under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. As relevant here, the District Court\n  granted summary judgment to petitioners, concluding that Myriad\u2019s\n  claims were invalid because they covered products of nature. The\n  Federal Circuit initially reversed, but on remand in light of Mayo\n  Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., 566 U. S. ___,\n  the Circuit found both isolated DNA and cDNA patent eligible.\n2        ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                         Syllabus\n\n\nHeld: A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and\n not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated, but cDNA is\n patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. Pp. 10\u201318.\n    (a) The Patent Act permits patents to be issued to \u201c[w]hoever in-\n vents or discovers any new and useful . . . composition of matter,\u201d\n \u00a7101, but \u201claws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\u201d\n \u201c \u2018are basic tools of scientific and technological work\u2019 \u201d that lie beyond\n the domain of patent protection, Mayo, supra, at ___. The rule\n against patents on naturally occurring things has limits, however.\n Patent protection strikes a delicate balance between creating \u201cincen-\n tives that lead to creation, invention, and discovery\u201d and \u201cimped[ing]\n the flow of information that might permit, indeed spur, invention.\u201d\n Id., at ___. This standard is used to determine whether Myriad\u2019s pa-\n tents claim a \u201cnew and useful . . . composition of matter,\u201d \u00a7101, or\n claim naturally occurring phenomena. Pp. 10\u201311.\n    (b) Myriad\u2019s DNA claim falls within the law of nature exception.\n Myriad\u2019s principal contribution was uncovering the precise location\n and genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Diamond v.\n Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry\n whether such action was new \u201cwith markedly different characteris-\n tics from any found in nature,\u201d id., at 310. Myriad did not create or\n alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and\n BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA. It found an im-\n portant and useful gene, but groundbreaking, innovative, or even\n brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the \u00a7101 inquiry. See\n Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127. Finding\n the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes does not render the\n genes patent eligible \u201cnew . . . composition[s] of matter,\u201d \u00a7101. Myri-\n ad\u2019s patent descriptions highlight the problem with its claims: They\n detail the extensive process of discovery, but extensive effort alone is\n insufficient to satisfy \u00a7101\u2019s demands. Myriad\u2019s claims are not saved\n by the fact that isolating DNA from the human genome severs the\n chemical bonds that bind gene molecules together. The claims are\n not expressed in terms of chemical composition, nor do they rely on\n the chemical changes resulting from the isolation of a particular DNA\n section. Instead, they focus on the genetic information encoded in the\n BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Finally, Myriad argues that the Patent\n and Trademark Office\u2019s past practice of awarding gene patents is en-\n titled to deference, citing J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred\n Int\u2019l, Inc., 534 U. S. 124, a case where Congress had endorsed a PTO\n practice in subsequent legislation. There has been no such endorse-\n ment here, and the United States argued in the Federal Circuit and\n in this Court that isolated DNA was not patent eligible under \u00a7101.\n Pp. 12\u201316.\n                     Cite as: 569 U.

Its creation results in\n  an exons-only molecule, which is not naturally occurring. Its order of\n  the exons may be dictated by nature, but the lab technician unques-\n  tionably creates something new when introns are removed from a\n  DNA sequence to make cDNA. Pp. 16\u201317.\n     (d) This case, it is important to note, does not involve method\n  claims, patents on new applications of knowledge about the BRCA1\n  and BRCA2 genes, or the patentability of DNA in which the order of\n  the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered.

(Myriad), discovered\nthe precise location and sequence of two human genes,\nmutations of which can substantially increase the risks of\nbreast and ovarian cancer. Myriad obtained a number\nof patents based upon its discovery. This case involves\nclaims from three of them and requires us to resolve\nwhether a naturally occurring segment of deoxyribonucleic\nacid (DNA) is patent eligible under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101 by\nvirtue of its isolation from the rest of the human genome.\nWe also address the patent eligibility of synthetically\ncreated DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA), which\ncontains the same protein-coding information found in\na segment of natural DNA but omits portions within the\nDNA segment that do not code for proteins. For the rea-\nsons that follow, we hold that a naturally occurring DNA\nsegment is a product of nature and not patent eligible\nmerely because it has been isolated, but that cDNA is\npatent eligible because it is not naturally occurring. We,\ntherefore, affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of\n2      ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   Genes form the basis for hereditary traits in living\norganisms.

The human ge-\nnome consists of approximately 22,000 genes packed into\n23 pairs of chromosomes. Each gene is encoded as DNA,\nwhich takes the shape of the familiar \u201cdouble helix\u201d\nthat Doctors James Watson and Francis Crick first de-\nscribed in 1953. Each \u201ccross-bar\u201d in the DNA helix con-\nsists of two chemically joined nucleotides. The possible\nnucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and\nguanine (G), each of which binds naturally with another\nnucleotide: A pairs with T; C pairs with G. The nucleotide\ncross-bars are chemically connected to a sugar-phosphate\nbackbone that forms the outside framework of the DNA\nhelix. Sequences of DNA nucleotides contain the infor-\nmation necessary to create strings of amino acids, which\nin turn are used in the body to build proteins. Only some\nDNA nucleotides, however, code for amino acids; these\nnucleotides are known as \u201cexons.\u201d Nucleotides that do not\ncode for amino acids, in contrast, are known as \u201cintrons.\u201d\n   Creation of proteins from DNA involves two principal\nsteps, known as transcription and translation. In tran-\nscription, the bonds between DNA nucleotides separate,\nand the DNA helix unwinds into two single strands. A\nsingle strand is used as a template to create a complemen-\ntary ribonucleic acid (RNA) strand. The nucleotides on the\nDNA strand pair naturally with their counterparts, with\nthe exception that RNA uses the nucleotide base uracil (U)\ninstead of thymine (T). Transcription results in a single\nstrand RNA molecule, known as pre-RNA, whose nucleo-\ntides form an inverse image of the DNA strand from which\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nit was created. Pre-RNA still contains nucleotides corre-\nsponding to both the exons and introns in the DNA mole-\ncule. The pre-RNA is then naturally \u201cspliced\u201d by the\nphysical removal of the introns. The resulting product is a\nstrand of RNA that contains nucleotides corresponding\nonly to the exons from the original DNA strand. The\nexons-only strand is known as messenger RNA (mRNA),\nwhich creates amino acids through translation. In trans-\nlation, cellular structures known as ribosomes read each\nset of three nucleotides, known as codons, in the mRNA.\nEach codon either tells the ribosomes which of the 20\npossible amino acids to synthesize or provides a stop\nsignal that ends amino acid production.\n   DNA\u2019s informational sequences and the processes that\ncreate mRNA, amino acids, and proteins occur naturally\nwithin cells. Scientists can, however, extract DNA from\ncells using well known laboratory methods. These meth-\nods allow scientists to isolate specific segments of DNA\u2014\nfor instance, a particular gene or part of a gene\u2014which\ncan then be further studied, manipulated, or used. It is also\npossible to create DNA synthetically through processes\nsimilarly well known in the field of genetics. One such\nmethod begins with an mRNA molecule and uses the\nnatural bonding properties of nucleotides to create a new,\nsynthetic DNA molecule. The result is the inverse of the\nmRNA\u2019s inverse image of the original DNA, with one\nimportant distinction: Because the natural creation of\nmRNA involves splicing that removes introns, the synthetic\nDNA created from mRNA also contains only the exon\nsequences. This synthetic DNA created in the laboratory\nfrom mRNA is known as complementary DNA (cDNA).\n   Changes in the genetic sequence are called mutations.\nMutations can be as small as the alteration of a single\nnucleotide\u2014a change affecting only one letter in the genetic\ncode. Such small-scale changes can produce an entirely\ndifferent amino acid or can end protein production alto-\n4      ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ngether. Large changes, involving the deletion, rearrange-\nment, or duplication of hundreds or even millions of nu-\ncleotides, can result in the elimination, misplacement, or\nduplication of entire genes. Some mutations are harmless,\nbut others can cause disease or increase the risk of dis-\nease. As a result, the study of genetics can lead to valu-\nable medical breakthroughs.\n                             B\n   This case involves patents filed by Myriad after it made\none such medical breakthrough. Myriad discovered the\nprecise location and sequence of what are now known as\nthe BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations in these genes\ncan dramatically increase an individual\u2019s risk of develop-\ning breast and ovarian cancer. The average American\nwoman has a 12- to 13-percent risk of developing breast\ncancer, but for women with certain genetic mutations, the\nrisk can range between 50 and 80 percent for breast can-\ncer and between 20 and 50 percent for ovarian cancer.\nBefore Myriad\u2019s discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes, scientists knew that heredity played a role in estab-\nlishing a woman\u2019s risk of developing breast and ovarian\ncancer, but they did not know which genes were associated\nwith those cancers.\n   Myriad identified the exact location of the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes on chromosomes 17 and 13. Chromosome\n17 has approximately 80 million nucleotides, and chro-\nmosome 13 has approximately 114 million. Association\nfor Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and Trade-\nmark Office, 689 F. 3d 1303, 1328 (CA Fed. 2012). Within\nthose chromosomes, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are\neach about 80,000 nucleotides long. If just exons are\ncounted, the BRCA1 gene is only about 5,500 nucleotides\nlong; for the BRCA2 gene, that number is about 10,200.\nIbid. Knowledge of the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes allowed Myriad to determine their typical nucleotide\n                     Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                   5\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nsequence.1 That information, in turn, enabled Myriad to\ndevelop medical tests that are useful for detecting muta-\ntions in a patient\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby\nassessing whether the patient has an increased risk of\ncancer.\n   Once it found the location and sequence of the BRCA1\nand BRCA2 genes, Myriad sought and obtained a number\nof patents. Nine composition claims from three of those\npatents are at issue in this case.2 See id., at 1309, and\nn. 1 (noting composition claims). Claims 1, 2, 5, and 6\nfrom the \u2019282 patent are representative. The first claim\nasserts a patent on \u201c[a]n isolated DNA coding for a BRCA1\npolypeptide,\u201d which has \u201cthe amino acid sequence set forth\nin SEQ ID NO:2.\u201d App. 822. SEQ ID NO:2 sets forth a list\nof 1,863 amino acids that the typical BRCA1 gene encodes.\nSee id., at 785\u2013790. Put differently, claim 1 asserts a\npatent claim on the DNA code that tells a cell to produce\nthe string of BRCA1 amino acids listed in SEQ ID NO:2.\n   Claim 2 of the \u2019282 patent operates similarly. It claims\n\u201c[t]he isolated DNA of claim 1, wherein said DNA has the\nnucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1.\u201d Id., at\n822. Like SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:1 sets forth a\nlong list of data, in this instance the sequence of cDNA that\ncodes for the BRCA1 amino acids listed in claim 1. Im-\nportantly, SEQ ID NO:1 lists only the cDNA exons in the\nBRCA1 gene, rather than a full DNA sequence contain-\ning both exons and introns. See id., at 779 (stating that\nSEQ ID NO:1\u2019s \u201cMOLECULE TYPE:\u201d is \u201ccDNA\u201d). As a re-\nsult, the Federal Circuit recognized that claim 2 asserts a\npatent on the cDNA nucleotide sequence listed in SEQ ID\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Technically, there is no \u201ctypical\u201d gene because nucleotide sequences\n\nvary between individuals, sometimes dramatically.

Patent 5,693,473 (the \u2019473 patent), and\nclaims 1, 6, and 7 of U. S.

In particular, it claims \u201c[a]n isolated DNA having\nat least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 1.\u201d App. 822.\nThe practical effect of claim 5 is to assert a patent on any\nseries of 15 nucleotides that exist in the typical BRCA1\ngene. Because the BRCA1 gene is thousands of nucleo-\ntides long, even BRCA1 genes with substantial mutations\nare likely to contain at least one segment of 15 nucleotides\nthat correspond to the typical BRCA1 gene. Similarly,\nclaim 6 of the \u2019282 patent claims \u201c[a]n isolated DNA hav-\ning at least 15 nucleotides of the DNA of claim 2.\u201d Ibid.\nThis claim operates similarly to claim 5, except that it\nreferences the cDNA-based claim 2. The remaining claims\nat issue are similar, though several list common mutations\nrather than typical BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences. See\nibid. (claim 7 of the \u2019282 patent); id., at 930 (claim 1 of the\n\u2019473 patent); id., at 1028 (claims 1, 6, and 7 of the \u2019492\npatent).\n                               C\n  Myriad\u2019s patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive\nright to isolate an individual\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes\n(or any strand of 15 or more nucleotides within the genes)\nby breaking the covalent bonds that connect the DNA to\nthe rest of the individual\u2019s genome. The patents would\nalso give Myriad the exclusive right to synthetically create\nBRCA cDNA. In Myriad\u2019s view, manipulating BRCA DNA\nin either of these fashions triggers its \u201cright to exclude\nothers from making\u201d its patented composition of matter\nunder the Patent Act. 35 U.

The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s\nGenetic Diagnostic Laboratory (GDL) and others provided\ngenetic testing services to women. Petitioner Dr. Harry\nOstrer, then a researcher at New York University School\nof Medicine, routinely sent his patients\u2019 DNA samples to\nGDL for testing. After learning of GDL\u2019s testing and\nOstrer\u2019s activities, Myriad sent letters to them asserting\nthat the genetic testing infringed Myriad\u2019s patents. App.\n94\u201395 (Ostrer letter). In response, GDL agreed to stop\ntesting and informed Ostrer that it would no longer accept\npatient samples. Myriad also filed patent infringement\nsuits against other entities that performed BRCA testing,\nresulting in settlements in which the defendants agreed to\ncease all allegedly infringing activity. 689 F. 3d, at 1315.\nMyriad, thus, solidified its position as the only entity\nproviding BRCA testing.\n   Some years later, petitioner Ostrer, along with medical\npatients, advocacy groups, and other doctors, filed this\nlawsuit seeking a declaration that Myriad\u2019s patents are\ninvalid under 35 U. S. C. \u00a7101. 702 F. Supp. 2d, at 186.\nCiting this Court\u2019s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genen-\ntech, Inc., 549 U.

The District Court then granted summary judg-\nment to petitioners on the composition claims at issue in\nthis case based on its conclusion that Myriad\u2019s claims,\nincluding claims related to cDNA, were invalid because\nthey covered products of nature. 702 F.

S. ___ (2012).\nSee Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genet-\nics, Inc., 566 U. S. ___ (2012).\n   On remand, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt in part and reversed in part, with each member of\nthe panel writing separately. All three judges agreed\nthat only petitioner Ostrer had standing. They reasoned\nthat Myriad\u2019s actions against him and his stated ability\nand willingness to begin BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing if Myr-\niad\u2019s patents were invalidated were sufficient for Article III\nstanding. 689 F. 3d, at 1323; id., at 1337 (opinion of\nMoore, J.); id., at 1348 (opinion of Bryson, J.).\n   With respect to the merits, the court held that both\nisolated DNA and cDNA were patent eligible under \u00a7101.\nThe central dispute among the panel members was\nwhether the act of isolating DNA\u2014separating a specific\ngene or sequence of nucleotides from the rest of the\nchromosome\u2014is an inventive act that entitles the individ-\nual who first isolates it to a patent. Each of the judges on\nthe panel had a different view on that question. Judges\nLourie and Moore agreed that Myriad\u2019s claims were patent\neligible under \u00a7101 but disagreed on the rationale. Judge\nLourie relied on the fact that the entire DNA molecule is\nheld together by chemical bonds and that the covalent\nbonds at both ends of the segment must be severed in\norder to isolate segments of DNA. This process technically\ncreates new molecules with unique chemical compositions.\nSee id., at 1328 (\u201cIsolated DNA . . . is a free-standing\nportion of a larger, natural DNA molecule. Isolated DNA\nhas been cleaved (i.e., had covalent bonds in its backbone\nchemically severed) or synthesized to consist of just a\nfraction of a naturally occurring DNA molecule\u201d). Judge\nLourie found this chemical alteration to be dispositive,\nbecause isolating a particular strand of DNA creates\na nonnaturally occurring molecule, even though the\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nchemical alteration does not change the information-\ntransmitting quality of the DNA. See id., at 1330 (\u201cThe\nclaimed isolated DNA molecules are distinct from their\nnatural existence as portions of larger entities, and their\ninformational content is irrelevant to that fact. We recog-\nnize that biologists may think of molecules in terms of\ntheir uses, but genes are in fact materials having a chemi-\ncal nature\u201d). Accordingly, he rejected petitioners\u2019 argument\nthat isolated DNA was ineligible for patent protection\nas a product of nature.\n   Judge Moore concurred in part but did not rely exclu-\nsively on Judge Lourie\u2019s conclusion that chemically break-\ning covalent bonds was sufficient to render isolated DNA\npatent eligible. Id., at 1341 (\u201cTo the extent the majority\nrests its conclusion on the chemical differences between\n[naturally occurring] and isolated DNA (breaking the\ncovalent bonds), I cannot agree that this is sufficient to\nhold that the claims to human genes are directed to pa-\ntentable subject matter\u201d). Instead, Judge Moore also\nrelied on the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s\n(PTO) practice of granting such patents and on the reli-\nance interests of patent holders. Id., at 1343. However,\nshe acknowledged that her vote might have come out\ndifferently if she \u201cwere deciding this case on a blank can-\nvas.\u201d Ibid.\n   Finally, Judge Bryson concurred in part and dissented\nin part, concluding that isolated DNA is not patent eli-\ngible. As an initial matter, he emphasized that the break-\ning of chemical bonds was not dispositive: \u201c[T]here is no magic\nto a chemical bond that requires us to recognize a new prod-\nuct when a chemical bond is created or broken.\u201d Id.,\nat 1351. Instead, he relied on the fact that \u201c[t]he nucleo-\ntide sequences of the claimed molecules are the same as\nthe nucleotide sequences found in naturally occurring\nhuman genes.\u201d Id., at 1355. Judge Bryson then concluded\nthat genetic \u201cstructural similarity dwarfs the significance\n10        ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n\n                   MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\nof the structural differences between isolated DNA and\nnaturally occurring DNA, especially where the structural\ndifferences are merely ancillary to the breaking of covalent\nbonds, a process that is itself not inventive.\u201d Ibid. More-\nover, Judge Bryson gave no weight to the PTO\u2019s position\non patentability because of the Federal Circuit\u2019s position\nthat \u201cthe PTO lacks substantive rulemaking authority as\nto issues such as patentability.\u201d Id., at 1357.\n  Although the judges expressed different views concern-\ning the patentability of isolated DNA, all three agreed that\npatent claims relating to cDNA met the patent eligibility\nrequirements of \u00a7101. Id., at 1326, and n. 9 (recognizing\nthat some patent claims are limited to cDNA and that\nsuch claims are patent eligible under \u00a7101); id., at 1337\n(Moore, J., concurring in part); id., at 1356 (Bryson, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201ccDNA cannot\nbe isolated from nature, but instead must be created in the\nlaboratory . . . because the introns that are found in the\nnative gene are removed from the cDNA segment\u201d).3 We\ngranted certiorari. 568 U.

Brief for Respondents 17\u201322. But we find\nthat, under the Court\u2019s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\nDr. Ostrer has alleged sufficient facts \u201cunder all the circumstances, [to]\nshow that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having\nadverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant\nthe issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d 549 U.

Rather, \u201c \u2018they are the basic tools of\nscientific and technological work\u2019 \u201d that lie beyond the\ndomain of patent protection. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). As\nthe Court has explained, without this exception, there\nwould be considerable danger that the grant of patents\nwould \u201ctie up\u201d the use of such tools and thereby \u201cinhibit\nfuture innovation premised upon them.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). This would be at odds with the very point\nof patents, which exist to promote creation. Diamond v.\nChakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, 309 (1980) (Products of na-\nture are not created, and \u201c \u2018manifestations . . . of nature\n[are] free to all men and reserved exclusively to none\u2019 \u201d).\n   The rule against patents on naturally occurring things\nis not without limits, however, for \u201call inventions at some\nlevel embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of\nnature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas,\u201d and \u201ctoo\nbroad an interpretation of this exclusionary principle\ncould eviscerate patent law.\u201d 566 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2). As we have recognized before, patent protection strikes\na delicate balance between creating \u201cincentives that lead\nto creation, invention, and discovery\u201d and \u201cimped[ing] the\nflow of information that might permit, indeed spur, in-\nvention.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23). We must apply this\nwell-established standard to determine whether Myr-\niad\u2019s patents claim any \u201cnew and useful . . . composition\nof matter,\u201d \u00a7101, or instead claim naturally occurring\nphenomena.\n                            B\n  It is undisputed that Myriad did not create or alter any\nof the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and\n12     ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nBRCA2 genes. The location and order of the nucleotides\nexisted in nature before Myriad found them. Nor did Myr-\niad create or alter the genetic structure of DNA. In-\nstead, Myriad\u2019s principal contribution was uncovering the\nprecise location and genetic sequence of the BRCA1\nand BRCA2 genes within chromosomes 17 and 13. The\nquestion is whether this renders the genes patentable.\n   Myriad recognizes that our decision in Chakrabarty is\ncentral to this inquiry. Brief for Respondents 14, 23\u201327.\nIn Chakrabarty, scientists added four plasmids to a bacte-\nrium, which enabled it to break down various components\nof crude oil. 447 U. S., at 305, and n. 1. The Court held\nthat the modified bacterium was patentable. It explained\nthat the patent claim was \u201cnot to a hitherto unknown\nnatural phenomenon, but to a nonnaturally occurring\nmanufacture or composition of matter\u2014a product of hu-\nman ingenuity \u2018having a distinctive name, character [and]\nuse.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 309\u2013310 (quoting Hartranft v. Wiegmann,\n121 U. S. 609, 615 (1887); alteration in original). The\nChakrabarty bacterium was new \u201cwith markedly different\ncharacteristics from any found in nature,\u201d 447 U. S., at\n310, due to the additional plasmids and resultant \u201ccapac-\nity for degrading oil.\u201d Id., at 305, n. 1. In this case, by\ncontrast, Myriad did not create anything. To be sure, it\nfound an important and useful gene, but separating that\ngene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of\ninvention.\n   Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery\ndoes not by itself satisfy the \u00a7101 inquiry. In Funk Broth-\ners Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U. S. 127 (1948),\nthis Court considered a composition patent that claimed a\nmixture of naturally occurring strains of bacteria that\nhelped leguminous plants take nitrogen from the air and\nfix it in the soil. Id., at 128\u2013129. The ability of the bacte-\nria to fix nitrogen was well known, and farmers commonly\n\u201cinoculated\u201d their crops with them to improve soil nitrogen\n                      Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nlevels. But farmers could not use the same inoculant for\nall crops, both because plants use different bacteria and\nbecause certain bacteria inhibit each other. Id., at 129\u2013\n130. Upon learning that several nitrogen-fixing bacteria\ndid not inhibit each other, however, the patent applicant\ncombined them into a single inoculant and obtained a\npatent. Id., at 130. The Court held that the composition\nwas not patent eligible because the patent holder did not\nalter the bacteria in any way. Id., at 132 (\u201cThere is no\nway in which we could call [the bacteria mixture a product\nof invention] unless we borrowed invention from the dis-\ncovery of the natural principle itself \u201d). His patent claim\nthus fell squarely within the law of nature exception. So\ndo Myriad\u2019s. Myriad found the location of the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes, but that discovery, by itself, does not render\nthe BRCA genes \u201cnew . . . composition[s] of matter,\u201d \u00a7101,\nthat are patent eligible.\n  Indeed, Myriad\u2019s patent descriptions highlight the\nproblem with its claims. For example, a section of the \u2019282\npatent\u2019s Detailed Description of the Invention indicates\nthat Myriad found the location of a gene associated with\nincreased risk of breast cancer and identified mutations of\nthat gene that increase the risk. See App. 748\u2013749.4 In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  full relevant text of the Detailed Description of the Patent is as\nfollows:\n   \u201cIt is a discovery of the present invention that the BRCA1 locus\nwhich predisposes individuals to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, is a\ngene encoding a BRCA1 protein, which has been found to have no\nsignificant homology with known protein or DNA sequences. . . . It is a\ndiscovery of the present invention that mutations in the BRCA1 locus\nin the germline are indicative of a predisposition to breast cancer and\novarian cancer. Finally, it is a discovery of the present invention that\nsomatic mutations in the BRCA1 locus are also associated with breast\ncancer, ovarian cancer and other cancers, which represents an indicator\nof these cancers or of the prognosis of these cancers. The mutational\nevents of the BRCA1 locus can involve deletions, insertions and point\nmutations.\u201d App. 749.\n14       ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nsubsequent language Myriad explains that the location of\nthe gene was unknown until Myriad found it among the\napproximately eight million nucleotide pairs contained in\na subpart of chromosome 17. See Ibid.5 The \u2019473 and \u2019492\npatents contain similar language as well. See id., at 854,\n947. Many of Myriad\u2019s patent descriptions simply detail\nthe \u201citerative process\u201d of discovery by which Myriad nar-\nrowed the possible locations for the gene sequences that it\nsought.6 See, e.g., id., at 750. Myriad seeks to import\nthese extensive research efforts into the \u00a7101 patent-\neligibility inquiry. Brief for Respondents 8\u201310, 34. But\nextensive effort alone is insufficient to satisfy the demands\nof \u00a7101.\n   Nor are Myriad\u2019s claims saved by the fact that isolating\nDNA from the human genome severs chemical bonds and\nthereby creates a nonnaturally occurring molecule. Myr-\niad\u2019s claims are simply not expressed in terms of chemical\ncomposition, nor do they rely in any way on the chemi-\ncal changes that result from the isolation of a particular\nsection of DNA. Instead, the claims understandably focus\non the genetic information encoded in the BRCA1 and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Notwithstanding Myriad\u2019s repeated use of the phrase \u201cpresent\ninvention,\u201d it is clear from the text of the patent that the various\ndiscoveries are the \u201cinvention.\u201d\n  5 \u201cStarting from a region on the long arm of human chromosome 17 of\n\nthe human genome, 17q, which has a size estimated at about 8 million\nbase pairs, a region which contains a genetic locus, BRCA1, which\ncauses susceptibility to cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer,\nhas been identified.\u201d Ibid.\n  6 Myriad first identified groups of relatives with a history of breast\n\ncancer (some of whom also had developed ovarian cancer); because\nthese individuals were related, scientists knew that it was more likely\nthat their diseases were the result of genetic predisposition rather than\nother factors. Myriad compared sections of their chromosomes, looking\nfor shared genetic abnormalities not found in the general population. It\nwas that process which eventually enabled Myriad to determine where\nin the genetic sequence the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes reside. See, e.g.,\nid., at 749, 763\u2013775.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBRCA2 genes. If the patents depended upon the creation\nof a unique molecule, then a would-be infringer could\narguably avoid at least Myriad\u2019s patent claims on entire\ngenes (such as claims 1 and 2 of the \u2019282 patent) by isolat-\ning a DNA sequence that included both the BRCA1 or\nBRCA2 gene and one additional nucleotide pair. Such a\nmolecule would not be chemically identical to the molecule\n\u201cinvented\u201d by Myriad. But Myriad obviously would resist\nthat outcome because its claim is concerned primarily with\nthe information contained in the genetic sequence, not\nwith the specific chemical composition of a particular\nmolecule.\n   Finally, Myriad argues that the PTO\u2019s past practice of\nawarding gene patents is entitled to deference, citing\nJ. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., 534\nU. S. 124 (2001). See Brief for Respondents 35\u201339, 49\u201350.\nWe disagree. J. E. M. held that new plant breeds were\neligible for utility patents under \u00a7101 notwithstanding\nseparate statutes providing special protections for plants,\nsee 7 U. S. C. \u00a72321 et seq. (Plant Variety Protection Act);\n35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7161\u2013164 (Plant Patent Act of 1930). After\nanalyzing the text and structure of the relevant statutes,\nthe Court mentioned that the Board of Patent Appeals and\nInterferences had determined that new plant breeds were\npatent eligible under \u00a7101 and that Congress had recog-\nnized and endorsed that position in a subsequent Patent\nAct amendment. 534 U. S., at 144\u2013145 (citing In re Hib-\nberd, 227 USPQ 443 (1985) and 35 U. S. C. \u00a7119(f)). In\nthis case, however, Congress has not endorsed the views of\nthe PTO in subsequent legislation. While Myriad relies on\nJudge Moore\u2019s view that Congress endorsed the PTO\u2019s\nposition in a single sentence in the Consolidated Appro-\npriations Act of 2004, see Brief for Respondents 31, n. 8;\n689 F. 3d, at 1346, that Act does not even mention genes,\nmuch less isolated DNA. \u00a7634, 118 Stat. 101 (\u201cNone of the\nfunds appropriated or otherwise made available under this\n16       ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n                  MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\nAct may be used to issue patents on claims directed to or\nencompassing a human organism\u201d).\n  Further undercutting the PTO\u2019s practice, the United\nStates argued in the Federal Circuit and in this Court that\nisolated DNA was not patent eligible under \u00a7101, Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 20\u201333, and that the\nPTO\u2019s practice was not \u201ca sufficient reason to hold that\nisolated DNA is patent-eligible.\u201d Id., at 26. See also id.,\nat 28\u201329. These concessions weigh against deferring to\nthe PTO\u2019s determination.7\n                            C\n   cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentabil-\nity as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. As\nalready explained, creation of a cDNA sequence from\nmRNA results in an exons-only molecule that is not natu-\nrally occurring.8 Petitioners concede that cDNA differs\nfrom natural DNA in that \u201cthe non-coding regions have\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Myriad  also argues that we should uphold its patents so as not to\ndisturb the reliance interests of patent holders like itself. Brief for\nRespondents 38\u201339. Concerns about reliance interests arising from\nPTO determinations, insofar as they are relevant, are better directed to\nCongress. See Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories,\nInc., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 22\u201324).\n   8 Some viruses rely on an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to re-\n\nproduce by copying RNA into cDNA. In rare instances, a side effect of\na viral infection of a cell can be the random incorporation of fragments\nof the resulting cDNA, known as a pseudogene, into the genome. Such\npseudogenes serve no purpose; they are not expressed in protein\ncreation because they lack genetic sequences to direct protein expres-\nsion. See J. Watson et al., Molecular Biology of the Gene 142, 144, fig.\n7\u20135 (6th ed. 2008). Perhaps not surprisingly, given pseudogenes\u2019\napparently random origins, petitioners \u201chave failed to demonstrate that\nthe pseudogene consists of the same sequence as the BRCA1 cDNA.\u201d\nAssociation for Molecular Pathology v. United States Patent and\nTrademark Office, 689 F. 3d 1303, 1356, n. 5 (CA Fed. 2012). The\npossibility that an unusual and rare phenomenon might randomly\ncreate a molecule similar to one created synthetically through human\ningenuity does not render a composition of matter nonpatentable.\n                    Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                17\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nbeen removed.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 49. They neverthe-\nless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because \u201c[t]he\nnucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by\nthe lab technician.\u201d Id., at 51. That may be so, but the lab\ntechnician unquestionably creates something new when\ncDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring\nexons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which\nit was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a \u201cproduct of\nnature\u201d and is patent eligible under \u00a7101, except insofar\nas very short series of DNA may have no intervening\nintrons to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation,\na short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from\nnatural DNA.9\n                            III\n  It is important to note what is not implicated by this\ndecision. First, there are no method claims before this\nCourt. Had Myriad created an innovative method of\nmanipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and\nBRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method pat-\nent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA\nwere well understood by geneticists at the time of Myriad\u2019s\npatents \u201cwere well understood, widely used, and fairly\nuniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for\na gene would likely have utilized a similar approach,\u201d 702\nF. Supp. 2d, at 202\u2013203, and are not at issue in this case.\n  Similarly, this case does not involve patents on new\napplications of knowledge about the BRCA1 and BRCA2\ngenes. Judge Bryson aptly noted that, \u201c[a]s the first party\nwith knowledge of the [BRCA1 and BRCA2] sequences,\nMyriad was in an excellent position to claim applications\nof that knowledge. Many of its unchallenged claims are\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 We express no opinion whether cDNA satisfies the other statutory\n\nrequirements of patentability. See, e.g., 35 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7102, 103, and\n112; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, n. 5.\n18     ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY v.\n\n                MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nlimited to such applications.\u201d 689 F. 3d, at 1349.\n   Nor do we consider the patentability of DNA in which\nthe order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been\naltered. Scientific alteration of the genetic code presents a\ndifferent inquiry, and we express no opinion about the\napplication of \u00a7101 to such endeavors. We merely hold\nthat genes and the information they encode are not patent\neligible under \u00a7101 simply because they have been isolated\nfrom the surrounding genetic material.\n                         *    *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Federal\nCircuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 569 U.

I am un-\nable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even\nmy own belief. It suffices for me to affirm, having studied\nthe opinions below and the expert briefs presented here,\nthat the portion of DNA isolated from its natural state\nsought to be patented is identical to that portion of the\nDNA in its natural state; and that complementary DNA\n(cDNA) is a synthetic creation not normally present in\nnature.\n</pre>",
