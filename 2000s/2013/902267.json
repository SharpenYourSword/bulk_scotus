CITY\n      OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11\u2013798.      Argued April 16, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nThe Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los Angeles, is run by\n  a Board of Harbor Commissioners pursuant to a municipal ordinance\n  known as a tariff. The Port leases marine terminal facilities to oper-\n  ators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships. Federal-\n  ly licensed short-haul trucks, called \u201cdrayage trucks,\u201d assist in those\n  operations by moving cargo into and out of the Port. In 2007, in re-\n  sponse to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port ex-\n  pansion on traffic, the environment, and safety, the Board imple-\n  mented a Clean Truck Program. As part of that program, the Board\n  devised a standard-form \u201cconcession agreement\u201d to govern the rela-\n  tionship between the Port and drayage companies. The agreement\n  requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone\n  number for reporting concerns, and to submit a plan listing off-street\n  parking locations for each truck. Other requirements relate to a\n  company\u2019s financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its em-\n  ployment of drivers. The concession agreement sets out penalties for\n  violations, including possible suspension or revocation of the right to\n  provide drayage services. The Board also amended the Port\u2019s tariff to\n  ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.\n  The amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or\n  imprisonment, for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregis-\n  tered drayage truck.\n     Petitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), whose\n  members include many of the drayage companies at the Port, sued\n  the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the concession\n  agreement\u2019s requirements. ATA principally contended that the re-\n  quirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Admin-\n2       AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    istration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), see 49 U. S. C.\n    \u00a714501(c)(1). ATA also argued that even if the requirements are val-\n    id, Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61, prevents the Port\n    from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting compa-\n    ny\u2019s right to operate at the Port. The District Court held that neither\n    \u00a714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevented the Port from proceeding with its\n    program. The Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed, finding only the driver-\n    employment provision preempted and rejecting petitioner\u2019s Castle\n    claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The FAAAA expressly preempts the concession agreement\u2019s\n placard and parking requirements. Section 14501(c)(1) preempts a\n state \u201claw, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect\n of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . .\n with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d               49 U. S. C.\n \u00a714501(c)(1). Because the parties agree that the Port\u2019s placard and\n parking requirements relate to a motor carrier\u2019s price, route, or ser-\n vice with respect to transporting property, the only disputed question\n is whether those requirements \u201chav[e] the force and effect of law.\u201d\n Section 14501(c)(1) draws a line between a government\u2019s exercise of\n regulatory authority and its own contract-based participation in a\n market. The statute\u2019s \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language excludes\n from the clause\u2019s scope contractual arrangements made by a State\n when it acts as a market participant, not as a regulator. See, e.g.,\n American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 229. But here, the\n Port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard\n and parking requirements.          It forced terminal operators\u2014and\n through them, trucking companies\u2014to alter their conduct by imple-\n menting a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment. That\n counts as action \u201chaving the force and effect of law\u201d if anything does.\n    The Port\u2019s primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives ra-\n ther than means. But the Port\u2019s proprietary intentions do not con-\n trol. When the government employs a coercive mechanism, available\n to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or\n not it does so to turn a profit. Only if it forgoes the (distinctively gov-\n ernmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s\n preemptive scope. That the criminal sanctions fall on terminal oper-\n ators, not directly on the trucking companies, also makes no differ-\n ence. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552\n U. S. 364, 371\u2013373. Pp. 6\u221210.\n    2. This Court declines to decide in the case\u2019s present, pre-\n enforcement posture whether Castle limits the way the Port can en-\n force the financial-capacity and truck-maintenance requirements up-\n held by the Ninth Circuit.

But Castle does not prevent a\n  State from taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporaneously\n  out of compliance with such regulations. And at this juncture, there\n  is no basis for finding that the Port will actually use the concession\n  agreement\u2019s penalty provision as Castle proscribes.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES, \n\n              CALIFORNIA, ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 13, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In this case, we consider whether federal law preempts\ncertain provisions of an agreement that trucking compa-\nnies must sign before they can transport cargo at the Port\nof Los Angeles. We hold that the Federal Aviation Admin-\nistration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) expressly\npreempts two of the contract\u2019s provisions, which require\nsuch a company to develop an off-street parking plan and\ndisplay designated placards on its vehicles. We decline to\ndecide in the case\u2019s present, pre-enforcement posture\nwhether, under Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348\nU. S. 61 (1954), federal law governing licenses for inter-\nstate motor carriers prevents the Port from using the\nagreement\u2019s penalty clause to punish violations of other,\nnon-preempted provisions.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n The Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los\nAngeles, is the largest port in the country. The Port owns\nmarine terminal facilities, which it leases to \u201cterminal\n2    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noperators\u201d (such as shipping lines and stevedoring compa-\nnies) that load cargo onto and unload it from docking\nships. Short-haul trucks, called \u201cdrayage trucks,\u201d move\nthe cargo into and out of the Port. The trucking compa-\nnies providing those drayage services are all federally\nlicensed motor carriers. Before the events giving rise\nto this case, they contracted with terminal operators to\ntransport cargo, but did not enter into agreements with\nthe Port itself.\n   The City\u2019s Board of Harbor Commissioners runs the\nPort pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff,\nwhich sets out various regulations and charges. In the\nlate 1990\u2019s, the Board decided to enlarge the Port\u2019s facili-\nties to accommodate more ships. Neighborhood and envi-\nronmental groups objected to the proposed expansion,\narguing that it would increase congestion and air pollution\nand decrease safety in the surrounding area. A lawsuit\nthey brought, and another they threatened, stymied the\nBoard\u2019s development project for almost 10 years.\n   To address the community\u2019s concerns, the Board imple-\nmented a Clean Truck Program beginning in 2007.\nAmong other actions, the Board devised a standard-form\n\u201cconcession agreement\u201d to govern the relationship between\nthe Port and any trucking company seeking to operate on\nthe premises. Under that contract, a company may\ntransport cargo at the Port in exchange for complying with\nvarious requirements. The two directly at issue here\ncompel the company to (1) affix a placard on each truck\nwith a phone number for reporting environmental or\nsafety concerns (You\u2019ve seen the type: \u201cHow am I driving?\n213\u2013867\u20135309\u201d) and (2) submit a plan listing off-street\nparking locations for each truck when not in service.\nThree other provisions in the agreement, formerly dis-\nputed in this litigation, relate to the company\u2019s financial\ncapacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of\ndrivers.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Board then amended the Port\u2019s tariff to ensure that\nevery company providing drayage services at the facility\nwould enter into the concession agreement. The mecha-\nnism the Board employed is a criminal prohibition on\nterminal operators. The amended tariff provides that \u201cno\nTerminal Operator shall permit access into any Terminal\nin the Port of Los Angeles to any Drayage Truck unless\nsuch Drayage Truck is registered under a Concession\n[Agreement].\u201d App. 105. A violation of that provision\u2014\nwhich occurs \u201ceach and every day\u201d a terminal operator\nprovides access to an unregistered truck\u2014is a misde-\nmeanor. Id., at 86. It is punishable by a fine of up to $500\nor a prison sentence of up to six months. Id., at 85\u201386.\n  The concession agreement itself spells out penalties for\nany signatory trucking company that violates its require-\nments. When a company commits a \u201cMinor Default,\u201d the\nPort may issue a warning letter or order the company to\nundertake \u201ccorrective action,\u201d complete a \u201ccourse of . . .\ntraining,\u201d or pay the costs of the Port\u2019s investigation. Id.,\nat 81\u201382. When a company commits a \u201cMajor Default,\u201d\nthe Port may also suspend or revoke the company\u2019s right\nto provide drayage services at the Port. Id., at 82. The\nagreement, however, does not specify which breaches of\nthe contract qualify as \u201cMajor,\u201d rather than \u201cMinor.\u201d And\nthe parties agree that the Port has never suspended or\nrevoked a trucking company\u2019s license to operate at the\nPort for a prior violation of one of the contract provisions\ninvolved in this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42\u201343, 49\u201351.\n                            B\n  Petitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA),\nis a national trade association representing the trucking\nindustry, including drayage companies that operate at the\nPort. ATA filed suit against the Port and City, seeking an\ninjunction against the five provisions of the concession\nagreement discussed above. The complaint principally\n4     AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncontended that \u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA expressly\npreempts those requirements. That statutory section\nstates:\n     \u201c[A] State [or local government] may not enact or en-\n     force a law, regulation, or other provision having the\n     force and effect of law related to a price, route, or ser-\n     vice of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the trans-\n     portation of property.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1).1\nATA also offered a back-up argument: Even if the re-\nquirements are valid, ATA claimed, the Port may not\nenforce them by withdrawing a defaulting company\u2019s right\nto operate at the Port. That argument rested on Castle v.\nHayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61 (1954), which held\nthat Illinois could not bar a federally licensed motor car-\nrier from its highways for prior violations of state safety\nregulations. We reasoned in Castle that the State\u2019s action\nconflicted with federal law providing for certification of\nmotor carriers; and ATA argued here that a similar con-\nflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to\nsuspend or revoke a trucking company\u2019s privileges. Fol-\nlowing a bench trial, the District Court held that neither\n\u00a714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevents the Port from proceeding\nwith any part of its Clean Truck Program.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mainly af-\nfirmed. Most important for our purposes, the court held\nthat \u00a714501(c)(1) does not preempt the agreement\u2019s plac-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 ATA also contended that a separate provision, 49 U. S. C. \u00a714506(a),\n\npreempts the agreement\u2019s placard requirement. That section bars state\nand local governments from enacting or enforcing \u201cany law, rule,\nregulation[,] standard, or other provision having the force and effect of\nlaw\u201d that obligates a motor carrier to display any form of identification\nother than those the Secretary of Transportation has required. Ibid.\nThe just-quoted language is the only part of \u00a714506(a) disputed here,\nand it is materially identical to language in \u00a714501(c)(1). We focus on\n\u00a714501(c)(1) for ease of reference, but everything we say about that\nprovision also applies to \u00a714506(a).\n                       Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                        5\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\nard and parking requirements because they do not\n\u201c \u2018 ha[ve] the force and effect of law.\u2019 \u201d 660 F. 3d 384, 395\n(2011) (quoting \u00a714501(c)(1)). The court reasoned that\nthose requirements, rather than regulating the drayage\nmarket, advance the Port\u2019s own \u201cbusiness interest\u201d in\n\u201cmanaging its facilities.\u201d Id., at 401. Both provisions were\n\u201cdesigned to address [a] specific proprietary problem[ ]\u201d\u2014\nthe need to \u201cincrease the community good-will necessary\nto facilitate Port expansion.\u201d Id., at 406\u2013407; see id., at\n409.      The Ninth Circuit also held the agreement\u2019s\nfinancial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions not\npreempted, for reasons not relevant here.2            Section\n14501(c)(1), the court decided, preempts only the contract\u2019s\nemployment provision. Finally, the Ninth Circuit rejected\nATA\u2019s claim that Castle bars the Port from applying the\nagreement\u2019s penalty clause to withdraw a trucking com-\npany\u2019s right to operate at the facility. The court thought\nCastle inapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in\nthis case: \u201cUnlike a ban on using all of a State\u2019s freeways,\u201d\nthe court reasoned, \u201ca limitation on access to a single Port\ndoes not prohibit motor carriers\u201d from generally partici-\npating in interstate commerce. 660 F. 3d, at 403.\n    We granted certiorari to resolve two questions: first,\nwhether \u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the conces-\nsion agreement\u2019s placard and parking provisions; and\nsecond, whether Castle precludes reliance on the agree-\nment\u2019s penalty clause to suspend or revoke a trucking\ncompany\u2019s privileges. See 568 U. S. ___ (2013). Contrary\nto the Ninth Circuit, we hold that the placard and parking\nrequirements are preempted as \u201cprovision[s] having the\nforce and effect of law.\u201d That determination does not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For those curious, the court held that the financial-capacity re-\n\nquirement is not \u201c \u2018related to a [motor carrier\u2019s] price, route, or service,\u2019 \u201d\nand that the truck-maintenance requirement falls within a statutory\nexception for safety regulation. 660 F. 3d, at 395, 403\u2013406 (quoting\n\u00a714501(c)(1)); see \u00a714501(c)(2)(A) (safety exception).\n6       AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nobviate the enforcement issue arising from Castle because\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s rulings upholding the agreement\u2019s\nfinancial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions have\nnow become final;3 accordingly, the Port could try to apply\nits penalty provision to trucking companies that have\nviolated those surviving requirements. But we nonethe-\nless decline to address the Castle question because the\ncase\u2019s pre-enforcement posture obscures the nature of the\nagreement\u2019s remedial scheme, rendering any decision at\nthis point a shot in the dark.\n                                 II\n  Section 14501(c)(1), once again, preempts a state \u201claw,\nregulation, or other provision having the force and effect of\nlaw related to a price, route, or service of any motor car-\nrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d All\nparties agree that the Port\u2019s placard and parking require-\nments relate to a motor carrier\u2019s price, route, or service\nwith respect to transporting property. The only disputed\nquestion is whether those requirements \u201chav[e] the force\nand effect of law.\u201d The Port claims that they do not, be-\ncause the \u201cconcession contract is just [like] a private\nagreement,\u201d made to advance the Port\u2019s commercial and\n\u201cproprietary interests.\u201d Brief for Respondent City of Los\nAngeles et al. 19 (Brief for City of Los Angeles) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 ATA\u2019spetition for certiorari did not seek review of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s determination that the truck-maintenance provision is valid. The\npetition did ask us to consider the court\u2019s ruling on the financial-\ncapacity provision, but we declined to do so.\n  4 The Port\u2019s brief occasionally frames the issue differently\u2014as whether\n\na freestanding \u201cmarket-participant exception\u201d limits \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s\nexpress terms. See Brief for City of Los Angeles 24. But at oral argu-\nment, the Port emphasized that the supposed exception it invoked in\nfact derives from \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\u201c[W]hat we are calling the market participant\nexception . . . is generally congruent with[ ] what is meant by Congress\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

S. 218,\n233 (1993) (When a State acts as a purchaser of services,\n\u201cit does not \u2018regulate\u2019 the workings of the market . . . ;\nit exemplifies them\u201d (some internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language in\n\u00a714501(c)(1) excludes such everyday contractual arrange-\nments from the clause\u2019s scope. That phrasing targets the\nState acting as a State, not as any market actor\u2014or other-\nwise said, the State acting in a regulatory rather than\nproprietary mode.\n   But that statutory reading gets the Port nothing, be-\ncause it exercised classic regulatory authority\u2014complete\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nby the term \u2018force and effect of law\u2019 \u201d); id., at 39\u201340 (\u201cI\u2019m . . . relying on\nthe language . . . force and effect of law,\u201d which \u201cinvites a market\nparticipant analysis\u201d). We therefore have no occasion to consider\nwhether or when a preemption clause lacking such language would\nexcept a state or local government\u2019s proprietary actions.\n8    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the use of criminal penalties\u2014in imposing the plac-\nard and parking requirements at issue here. Consider\nagain how those requirements work. They are, to be sure,\ncontained in contracts between the Port and trucking\ncompanies. But those contracts do not stand alone, as the\nresult merely of the parties\u2019 voluntary commitments. The\nBoard of Harbor Commissioners aimed to \u201crequire parties\nwho access Port land and terminals for purposes of pro-\nviding drayage services\u201d to enter into concession agree-\nments with the Port. App. 108 (Board\u2019s \u201cFindings\u201d). And\nit accomplished that objective by amending the Port\u2019s\ntariff\u2014a form of municipal ordinance\u2014to provide that \u201cno\nTerminal Operator shall permit\u201d a drayage truck to gain\n\u201caccess into any Terminal in the Port\u201d unless the truck is\n\u201cregistered under\u201d such a concession agreement. Id., at\n105. A violation of that tariff provision is a violation of\ncriminal law. And it is punishable by a fine or a prison\nsentence of up to six months. Id., at 85\u201386. So the con-\ntract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental\nprogram wielding coercive power over private parties,\nbacked by the threat of criminal punishment.\n  That counts as action \u201chaving the force and effect of\nlaw\u201d if anything does. The Port here has not acted as a\nprivate party, contracting in a way that the owner of an\nordinary commercial enterprise could mimic. Rather, it\nhas forced terminal operators\u2014and through them, truck-\ning companies\u2014to alter their conduct by implementing a\ncriminal prohibition punishable by time in prison. In\nsome cases, the question whether governmental action has\nthe force of law may pose difficulties; the line between\nregulatory and proprietary conduct has soft edges. But\nthis case takes us nowhere near those uncertain bounda-\nries. Contractual commitments resulting not from ordi-\nnary bargaining (as in Wolens), but instead from the\nthreat of criminal sanctions manifest the government qua\ngovernment, performing its prototypical regulatory role.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Port\u2019s primary argument to the contrary, like the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s, focuses on motive rather than means. The\nCourt of Appeals related how community opposition had\nfrustrated the Port\u2019s expansion, and concluded that the\nClean Truck Program \u201crespon[ded] to perceived business\nnecessity.\u201d 660 F. 3d, at 407. The Port tells the identical\nstory, emphasizing that private companies have similar\nbusiness incentives to \u201cadopt[ ] \u2018green growth\u2019 plans like\nthe Port\u2019s.\u201d Brief for City of Los Angeles 30. We have no\nreason to doubt that account of events; we can assume the\nPort acted to enhance goodwill and improve the odds of\nachieving its business plan\u2014just as a private company\nmight. But the Port\u2019s intentions are not what matters.\nThat is because, as we just described, the Port chose a tool\nto fulfill those goals which only a government can wield:\nthe hammer of the criminal law. See United Haulers\nAssn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.,\n438 F. 3d 150, 157 (CA2 2006), aff \u2019d, 550 U. S. 330 (2007).\nAnd when the government employs such a coercive mech-\nanism, available to no private party, it acts with the force\nand effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a profit.\nOnly if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise\nof legal authority may it escape \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive\nscope.\n  The Port also tries another tack, reminding us that the\ncriminal sanctions here fall on terminal operators alone,\nnot on the trucking companies subject to the agreement\u2019s\nrequirements; hence, the Port maintains, the matter of\n\u201ccriminal penalties is a red herring.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 31;\nsee Brief for City of Los Angeles 39\u201340. But we fail to see\nwhy the target of the sanctions makes any difference. The\nPort selected an indirect but wholly effective means of\n\u201crequir[ing] parties . . . providing drayage services\u201d to\ndisplay placards and submit parking plans: To wit, the\nPort required terminal operators, on pain of criminal\npenalties, to insist that the truckers make those commit-\n10   AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments. App. 108; see supra, at 3, 8. We have often rejected\nefforts by States to avoid preemption by shifting their\nregulatory focus from one company to another in the same\nsupply chain. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor\nTransp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 371\u2013373 (2008) (finding\npreemption under the FAAAA although the State\u2019s re-\nquirements directly targeted retailers rather than motor\ncarriers); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality\nManagement Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 255 (2004) (finding\npreemption under the Clean Air Act although the re-\nquirements directly targeted car buyers rather than\nsellers). The same goes here. The Port made its regula-\ntion of drayage trucks mandatory by imposing criminal\npenalties on the entities hiring all such trucks at the\nfacility. Slice it or dice it any which way, the Port thus\nacted with the \u201cforce of law.\u201d\n                              III\n  Our rejection of the concession agreement\u2019s placard and\nparking requirements does not conclude this case. Two\nother provisions of the agreement are now in effect: As\nnoted earlier, the Ninth Circuit upheld the financial-\ncapacity and truck-maintenance requirements, and that\npart of its decision has become final. See supra, at 5, and\nn. 2. ATA argues that our holding in Castle limits the way\nthe Port can enforce those remaining requirements. Ac-\ncording to ATA, the Port may not rely on the agreement\u2019s\npenalty provision to suspend or revoke the right of non-\ncomplying trucking companies to operate on the premises.\n  As we have described, Castle rebuffed a State\u2019s attempt\nto bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways\nfor past infringements of state safety regulations. A fed-\neral statute, we explained, gave a federal agency the\nauthority to license interstate motor carriers, as well as a\ncarefully circumscribed power to suspend or terminate\nthose licenses for violations of law. That statute, we held,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimplicitly prohibited a State from \u201ctak[ing] action\u201d\u2014like a\nban on the use of its highways\u2014\u201camounting to a suspen-\nsion or revocation of an interstate carrier\u2019s [federally]\ngranted right to operate.\u201d 348 U. S., at 63\u201364.\n   The parties here dispute whether Castle restricts the\nPort\u2019s remedial authority. The Port echoes the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s view that banning a truck from \u201call of a State\u2019s\nfreeways\u201d is meaningfully different from denying it \u201caccess\nto a single Port.\u201d 660 F. 3d, at 403; see Brief for City of\nLos Angeles 49. ATA responds that because the Port is a\n\u201ccrucial channel of interstate commerce,\u201d Castle applies to\nit just as much as to roads. Brief for Petitioner 18.\n   But we see another question here: Does the Port\u2019s en-\nforcement scheme involve curtailing drayage trucks\u2019 oper-\nations in the way Castle prohibits, even assuming that\ndecision applies to facilities like this one? As just indicat-\ned, Castle puts limits on how a State or locality can punish\nan interstate motor carrier for prior violations of truck-\ning regulations (like the concession agreement\u2019s require-\nments). Nothing we said there, however, prevents a State\nfrom taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporane-\nously out of compliance with such regulations. Indeed,\nATA filed an amicus brief in Castle explaining that a\nvehicle \u201cthat fails to comply with the state\u2019s regulations\nmay be barred from the state\u2019s highways.\u201d Brief for ATA,\nO. T 1954, No. 44, p. 12; see Brief for Respondent, id.,\np. 23 (A State may \u201cstop and prevent from continuing on\nthe highway any motor vehicle which it finds not to be in\ncompliance\u201d). And ATA reiterates that view here, as does\nthe United States as amicus curiae. See Reply Brief 22;\nBrief for United States 29\u201330. So the Port would not\nviolate Castle if it barred a truck from operating at its\nfacilities to prevent an ongoing violation of the agree-\nment\u2019s requirements.\n   And at this juncture, we have no basis for finding that\nthe Port will ever use the agreement\u2019s penalty provision\n12   AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor anything more than that. That provision, to be sure,\nmight be read to give the Port broader authority: As noted\nearlier, the relevant text enables the Port to suspend\nor revoke a trucking company\u2019s right to provide dray-\nage services at the facility as a \u201c[r]emedy\u201d for a \u201cMajor\nDefault.\u201d App. 82; see supra, at 3. But the agreement\nnowhere states what counts as a \u201cMajor Default\u201d\u2014and\nspecifically, whether a company\u2019s breach of the financial-\ncapacity or truck-maintenance requirements would qual-\nify. And the Port has in fact never used its suspension or\nrevocation power to penalize a past violation of those\nrequirements. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 50\u201351. Indeed, the\nPort\u2019s brief states that \u201cit does not claim[ ] the authority to\npunish past, cured violations of the requirements chal-\nlenged here through suspension or revocation.\u201d Brief for\nCity of Los Angeles 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo the kind of enforcement ATA fears, and believes incon-\nsistent with Castle, might never come to pass at all.\n   In these circumstances, we decide not to decide ATA\u2019s\nCastle-based challenge. That claim, by its nature, attacks\nthe Port\u2019s enforcement scheme.           But given the pre-\nenforcement posture of this case, we cannot tell what that\nscheme entails. It might look like the one forbidden in\nCastle (as ATA anticipates), or else it might not (as the\nPort assures us). We see no reason to take a guess now\nabout what the Port will do later. There will be time\nenough to address the Castle question when, if ever, the\nPort enforces its agreement in a way arguably violating\nthat decision.\n                            IV\n  Section 14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the placard\nand parking provisions of the Port\u2019s concession agreement.\nWe decline to decide on the present record ATA\u2019s separate\nchallenge, based on Castle, to that agreement\u2019s penalty\nprovision.

I write separately to\nhighlight a constitutional concern regarding \u00a7601 of the\nFederal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n(FAAAA), 108 Stat. 1606, a statute the Court has now\nconsidered twice this Term. See Dan\u2019s City Used Cars,\nInc. v. Pelkey, 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n   The Constitution grants Congress authority \u201c[t]o regu-\nlate Commerce . . . among the several States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 3 (emphasis added). Section 14501 of Title 49 is titled\n\u201cFederal authority over intrastate transportation.\u201d (Em-\nphasis added.) The tension between \u00a714501 and the\nConstitution is apparent, because the Constitution does\nnot give Congress power to regulate intrastate commerce.\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 587, n. 2 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).        Nevertheless, \u00a714501(c)(1)\npurports to pre-empt any state or local law \u201crelated to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with\nrespect to the transportation of property.\u201d By its terms,\n\u00a714501(c) would pre-empt even a city ordinance establish-\ning a uniform rate for most transportation services origi-\nnating and ending inside city limits, so long as the services\nwere provided by a motor carrier. Such an extraordinary\nassertion of congressional authority cannot be reconciled\n2    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nwith our constitutional system of enumerated powers.\n   The Supremacy Clause provides the constitutional basis\nfor the pre-emption of state laws. Art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201cThis\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which\nshall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land\u201d). Because the Constitution and\nfederal laws are supreme, conflicting state laws are with-\nout legal effect. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade\nCouncil, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000). However, the constitu-\ntional text leaves no doubt that only federal laws made \u201cin\nPursuance\u201d of the Constitution are supreme. See Gregory\nv. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cAs long as it is\nacting within the powers granted it under the Constitu-\ntion, Congress may impose its will on the States\u201d (empha-\nsis added)); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583\u2013587 (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Given this limitation, Congress cannot pre-empt a state\nlaw merely by promulgating a conflicting statute\u2014the pre-\nempting statute must also be constitutional, both on its\nface and as applied. As relevant here, if Congress lacks\nauthority to enact a law regulating a particular intrastate\nactivity, it follows that Congress also lacks authority to\npre-empt state laws regulating that activity. See U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to\nthe people\u201d).\n   In this case, the Court concludes that \u201c[s]ection\n14501(c)(1) . . . preempts the placard and parking provi-\nsions of the Port\u2019s concession agreement.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nAlthough respondents waived any argument that Con-\ngress lacks authority to regulate the placards and parking\narrangements of drayage trucks using the port, I doubt\nthat Congress has such authority. The Court has iden-\ntified three categories of activity that Congress may\nregulate under the Commerce Clause: (1) the use of the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nchannels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities\nof interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate\ncommerce; and (3) \u201cactivities having a substantial relation\nto interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities that sub-\nstantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d Lopez, supra, at\n558\u2013559. Drayage trucks that carry cargo into and out of\nthe Port of Los Angeles undoubtedly operate within the\n\u201cchannels of interstate commerce\u201d\u2014for that is what a port\nis. Congress can therefore regulate conduct taking place\nwithin the port. But it is doubtful whether Congress has\nthe power to decide where a drayage truck should park\nonce it has left the port or what kind of placard the truck\nshould display while offsite. Even under the \u201csubstantial\neffects\u201d test, which I have rejected as a \u201c \u2018rootless and\nmalleable standard\u2019 at odds with the constitutional de-\nsign,\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 67 (dissenting opin-\nion) (quoting United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n627 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring)), it is difficult to say\nthat placards and parking arrangements substantially af-\nfect interstate commerce. Congress made no findings\nindicating that offsite parking\u2014conduct that falls within\nthe scope of the States\u2019 traditional police powers\u2014\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce. And I doubt\nthat it could. Nevertheless, because respondents did not\npreserve a constitutional challenge to the FAAAA and\nbecause I agree that the provisions in question have the\n\u201cforce and effect of law,\u201d I join the Court\u2019s opinion.\n",

CITY\n      OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 11\u2013798.      Argued April 16, 2013\u2014Decided June 13, 2013\nThe Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los Angeles, is run by\n  a Board of Harbor Commissioners pursuant to a municipal ordinance\n  known as a tariff. The Port leases marine terminal facilities to oper-\n  ators that load cargo onto and unload it from docking ships. Federal-\n  ly licensed short-haul trucks, called \u201cdrayage trucks,\u201d assist in those\n  operations by moving cargo into and out of the Port. In 2007, in re-\n  sponse to community concerns over the impact of a proposed port ex-\n  pansion on traffic, the environment, and safety, the Board imple-\n  mented a Clean Truck Program. As part of that program, the Board\n  devised a standard-form \u201cconcession agreement\u201d to govern the rela-\n  tionship between the Port and drayage companies. The agreement\n  requires a company to affix a placard on each truck with a phone\n  number for reporting concerns, and to submit a plan listing off-street\n  parking locations for each truck. Other requirements relate to a\n  company\u2019s financial capacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its em-\n  ployment of drivers. The concession agreement sets out penalties for\n  violations, including possible suspension or revocation of the right to\n  provide drayage services. The Board also amended the Port\u2019s tariff to\n  ensure that every drayage company would enter into the agreement.\n  The amended tariff makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or\n  imprisonment, for a terminal operator to grant access to an unregis-\n  tered drayage truck.\n     Petitioner American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), whose\n  members include many of the drayage companies at the Port, sued\n  the Port and City, seeking an injunction against the concession\n  agreement\u2019s requirements. ATA principally contended that the re-\n  quirements are expressly preempted by the Federal Aviation Admin-\n2       AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    istration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA), see 49 U. S. C.\n    \u00a714501(c)(1). ATA also argued that even if the requirements are val-\n    id, Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61, prevents the Port\n    from enforcing the requirements by withdrawing a defaulting compa-\n    ny\u2019s right to operate at the Port. The District Court held that neither\n    \u00a714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevented the Port from proceeding with its\n    program. The Ninth Circuit mainly affirmed, finding only the driver-\n    employment provision preempted and rejecting petitioner\u2019s Castle\n    claim.\nHeld:\n    1. The FAAAA expressly preempts the concession agreement\u2019s\n placard and parking requirements. Section 14501(c)(1) preempts a\n state \u201claw, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect\n of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . .\n with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d               49 U. S. C.\n \u00a714501(c)(1). Because the parties agree that the Port\u2019s placard and\n parking requirements relate to a motor carrier\u2019s price, route, or ser-\n vice with respect to transporting property, the only disputed question\n is whether those requirements \u201chav[e] the force and effect of law.\u201d\n Section 14501(c)(1) draws a line between a government\u2019s exercise of\n regulatory authority and its own contract-based participation in a\n market. The statute\u2019s \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language excludes\n from the clause\u2019s scope contractual arrangements made by a State\n when it acts as a market participant, not as a regulator. See, e.g.,\n American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219, 229. But here, the\n Port exercised classic regulatory authority in imposing the placard\n and parking requirements.          It forced terminal operators\u2014and\n through them, trucking companies\u2014to alter their conduct by imple-\n menting a criminal prohibition punishable by imprisonment. That\n counts as action \u201chaving the force and effect of law\u201d if anything does.\n    The Port\u2019s primary argument to the contrary focuses on motives ra-\n ther than means. But the Port\u2019s proprietary intentions do not con-\n trol. When the government employs a coercive mechanism, available\n to no private party, it acts with the force and effect of law, whether or\n not it does so to turn a profit. Only if it forgoes the (distinctively gov-\n ernmental) exercise of legal authority may it escape \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s\n preemptive scope. That the criminal sanctions fall on terminal oper-\n ators, not directly on the trucking companies, also makes no differ-\n ence. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Assn., 552\n U.

We hold that the Federal Aviation Admin-\nistration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAAA) expressly\npreempts two of the contract\u2019s provisions, which require\nsuch a company to develop an off-street parking plan and\ndisplay designated placards on its vehicles. We decline to\ndecide in the case\u2019s present, pre-enforcement posture\nwhether, under Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348\nU. S. 61 (1954), federal law governing licenses for inter-\nstate motor carriers prevents the Port from using the\nagreement\u2019s penalty clause to punish violations of other,\nnon-preempted provisions.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n The Port of Los Angeles, a division of the City of Los\nAngeles, is the largest port in the country. The Port owns\nmarine terminal facilities, which it leases to \u201cterminal\n2    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\noperators\u201d (such as shipping lines and stevedoring compa-\nnies) that load cargo onto and unload it from docking\nships. Short-haul trucks, called \u201cdrayage trucks,\u201d move\nthe cargo into and out of the Port. The trucking compa-\nnies providing those drayage services are all federally\nlicensed motor carriers. Before the events giving rise\nto this case, they contracted with terminal operators to\ntransport cargo, but did not enter into agreements with\nthe Port itself.\n   The City\u2019s Board of Harbor Commissioners runs the\nPort pursuant to a municipal ordinance known as a tariff,\nwhich sets out various regulations and charges. In the\nlate 1990\u2019s, the Board decided to enlarge the Port\u2019s facili-\nties to accommodate more ships. Neighborhood and envi-\nronmental groups objected to the proposed expansion,\narguing that it would increase congestion and air pollution\nand decrease safety in the surrounding area. A lawsuit\nthey brought, and another they threatened, stymied the\nBoard\u2019s development project for almost 10 years.\n   To address the community\u2019s concerns, the Board imple-\nmented a Clean Truck Program beginning in 2007.\nAmong other actions, the Board devised a standard-form\n\u201cconcession agreement\u201d to govern the relationship between\nthe Port and any trucking company seeking to operate on\nthe premises. Under that contract, a company may\ntransport cargo at the Port in exchange for complying with\nvarious requirements. The two directly at issue here\ncompel the company to (1) affix a placard on each truck\nwith a phone number for reporting environmental or\nsafety concerns (You\u2019ve seen the type: \u201cHow am I driving?\n213\u2013867\u20135309\u201d) and (2) submit a plan listing off-street\nparking locations for each truck when not in service.\nThree other provisions in the agreement, formerly dis-\nputed in this litigation, relate to the company\u2019s financial\ncapacity, its maintenance of trucks, and its employment of\ndrivers.\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Board then amended the Port\u2019s tariff to ensure that\nevery company providing drayage services at the facility\nwould enter into the concession agreement. The mecha-\nnism the Board employed is a criminal prohibition on\nterminal operators. The amended tariff provides that \u201cno\nTerminal Operator shall permit access into any Terminal\nin the Port of Los Angeles to any Drayage Truck unless\nsuch Drayage Truck is registered under a Concession\n[Agreement].\u201d App. 105. A violation of that provision\u2014\nwhich occurs \u201ceach and every day\u201d a terminal operator\nprovides access to an unregistered truck\u2014is a misde-\nmeanor. Id., at 86. It is punishable by a fine of up to $500\nor a prison sentence of up to six months. Id., at 85\u201386.\n  The concession agreement itself spells out penalties for\nany signatory trucking company that violates its require-\nments. When a company commits a \u201cMinor Default,\u201d the\nPort may issue a warning letter or order the company to\nundertake \u201ccorrective action,\u201d complete a \u201ccourse of . . .\ntraining,\u201d or pay the costs of the Port\u2019s investigation. Id.,\nat 81\u201382. When a company commits a \u201cMajor Default,\u201d\nthe Port may also suspend or revoke the company\u2019s right\nto provide drayage services at the Port. Id., at 82. The\nagreement, however, does not specify which breaches of\nthe contract qualify as \u201cMajor,\u201d rather than \u201cMinor.\u201d And\nthe parties agree that the Port has never suspended or\nrevoked a trucking company\u2019s license to operate at the\nPort for a prior violation of one of the contract provisions\ninvolved in this case.

(ATA),\nis a national trade association representing the trucking\nindustry, including drayage companies that operate at the\nPort. ATA filed suit against the Port and City, seeking an\ninjunction against the five provisions of the concession\nagreement discussed above. The complaint principally\n4     AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncontended that \u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA expressly\npreempts those requirements. That statutory section\nstates:\n     \u201c[A] State [or local government] may not enact or en-\n     force a law, regulation, or other provision having the\n     force and effect of law related to a price, route, or ser-\n     vice of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the trans-\n     portation of property.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a714501(c)(1).1\nATA also offered a back-up argument: Even if the re-\nquirements are valid, ATA claimed, the Port may not\nenforce them by withdrawing a defaulting company\u2019s right\nto operate at the Port. That argument rested on Castle v.\nHayes Freight Lines, Inc., 348 U. S. 61 (1954), which held\nthat Illinois could not bar a federally licensed motor car-\nrier from its highways for prior violations of state safety\nregulations. We reasoned in Castle that the State\u2019s action\nconflicted with federal law providing for certification of\nmotor carriers; and ATA argued here that a similar con-\nflict would inhere in applying the concession agreement to\nsuspend or revoke a trucking company\u2019s privileges. Fol-\nlowing a bench trial, the District Court held that neither\n\u00a714501(c)(1) nor Castle prevents the Port from proceeding\nwith any part of its Clean Truck Program.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit mainly af-\nfirmed. Most important for our purposes, the court held\nthat \u00a714501(c)(1) does not preempt the agreement\u2019s plac-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 ATA also contended that a separate provision, 49 U. S. C. \u00a714506(a),\n\npreempts the agreement\u2019s placard requirement. That section bars state\nand local governments from enacting or enforcing \u201cany law, rule,\nregulation[,] standard, or other provision having the force and effect of\nlaw\u201d that obligates a motor carrier to display any form of identification\nother than those the Secretary of Transportation has required. Ibid.\nThe just-quoted language is the only part of \u00a714506(a) disputed here,\nand it is materially identical to language in \u00a714501(c)(1). We focus on\n\u00a714501(c)(1) for ease of reference, but everything we say about that\nprovision also applies to \u00a714506(a).\n                       Cite as: 569 U.

The court reasoned that\nthose requirements, rather than regulating the drayage\nmarket, advance the Port\u2019s own \u201cbusiness interest\u201d in\n\u201cmanaging its facilities.\u201d Id., at 401. Both provisions were\n\u201cdesigned to address [a] specific proprietary problem[ ]\u201d\u2014\nthe need to \u201cincrease the community good-will necessary\nto facilitate Port expansion.\u201d Id., at 406\u2013407; see id., at\n409.      The Ninth Circuit also held the agreement\u2019s\nfinancial-capacity and truck-maintenance provisions not\npreempted, for reasons not relevant here.2            Section\n14501(c)(1), the court decided, preempts only the contract\u2019s\nemployment provision. Finally, the Ninth Circuit rejected\nATA\u2019s claim that Castle bars the Port from applying the\nagreement\u2019s penalty clause to withdraw a trucking com-\npany\u2019s right to operate at the facility. The court thought\nCastle inapplicable because of the narrower exclusion in\nthis case: \u201cUnlike a ban on using all of a State\u2019s freeways,\u201d\nthe court reasoned, \u201ca limitation on access to a single Port\ndoes not prohibit motor carriers\u201d from generally partici-\npating in interstate commerce. 660 F. 3d, at 403.\n    We granted certiorari to resolve two questions: first,\nwhether \u00a714501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the conces-\nsion agreement\u2019s placard and parking provisions; and\nsecond, whether Castle precludes reliance on the agree-\nment\u2019s penalty clause to suspend or revoke a trucking\ncompany\u2019s privileges. See 568 U. S. ___ (2013). Contrary\nto the Ninth Circuit, we hold that the placard and parking\nrequirements are preempted as \u201cprovision[s] having the\nforce and effect of law.\u201d That determination does not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 For those curious, the court held that the financial-capacity re-\n\nquirement is not \u201c \u2018related to a [motor carrier\u2019s] price, route, or service,\u2019 \u201d\nand that the truck-maintenance requirement falls within a statutory\nexception for safety regulation. 660 F. 3d, at 395, 403\u2013406 (quoting\n\u00a714501(c)(1)); see \u00a714501(c)(2)(A) (safety exception).\n6       AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v.

But we nonethe-\nless decline to address the Castle question because the\ncase\u2019s pre-enforcement posture obscures the nature of the\nagreement\u2019s remedial scheme, rendering any decision at\nthis point a shot in the dark.\n                                 II\n  Section 14501(c)(1), once again, preempts a state \u201claw,\nregulation, or other provision having the force and effect of\nlaw related to a price, route, or service of any motor car-\nrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d All\nparties agree that the Port\u2019s placard and parking require-\nments relate to a motor carrier\u2019s price, route, or service\nwith respect to transporting property. The only disputed\nquestion is whether those requirements \u201chav[e] the force\nand effect of law.\u201d The Port claims that they do not, be-\ncause the \u201cconcession contract is just [like] a private\nagreement,\u201d made to advance the Port\u2019s commercial and\n\u201cproprietary interests.\u201d Brief for Respondent City of Los\nAngeles et al. 19 (Brief for City of Los Angeles) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 ATA\u2019spetition for certiorari did not seek review of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s determination that the truck-maintenance provision is valid. The\npetition did ask us to consider the court\u2019s ruling on the financial-\ncapacity provision, but we declined to do so.\n  4 The Port\u2019s brief occasionally frames the issue differently\u2014as whether\n\na freestanding \u201cmarket-participant exception\u201d limits \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s\nexpress terms. See Brief for City of Los Angeles 24. But at oral argu-\nment, the Port emphasized that the supposed exception it invoked in\nfact derives from \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language. See\nTr. of Oral Arg. 31 (\u201c[W]hat we are calling the market participant\nexception . . . is generally congruent with[ ] what is meant by Congress\n                      Cite as: 569 U.

We recognized that distinction\nin American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U. S. 219 (1995),\nwhen we construed another statute\u2019s near-identical \u201cforce\nand effect of law\u201d language. That phrase, we stated, \u201ccon-\nnotes official, government-imposed policies\u201d prescribing\n\u201cbinding standards of conduct.\u201d Id., at 229, n. 5 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). And we contrasted that quin-\ntessential regulatory action to \u201ccontractual commitment[s]\nvoluntarily undertaken.\u201d Id., at 229 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In Wolens, we addressed a State\u2019s en-\nforcement of an agreement between two private parties.\nBut the same reasoning holds if the government enters\ninto a contract just as a private party would\u2014for example,\nif a State (or City or Port) signs an agreement with a\ntrucking company to transport goods at a specified price.\nSee, e.g., Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated\nBuilders & Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218,\n233 (1993) (When a State acts as a purchaser of services,\n\u201cit does not \u2018regulate\u2019 the workings of the market . . . ;\nit exemplifies them\u201d (some internal quotation marks\nomitted)). The \u201cforce and effect of law\u201d language in\n\u00a714501(c)(1) excludes such everyday contractual arrange-\nments from the clause\u2019s scope. That phrasing targets the\nState acting as a State, not as any market actor\u2014or other-\nwise said, the State acting in a regulatory rather than\nproprietary mode.\n   But that statutory reading gets the Port nothing, be-\ncause it exercised classic regulatory authority\u2014complete\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nby the term \u2018force and effect of law\u2019 \u201d); id., at 39\u201340 (\u201cI\u2019m . . . relying on\nthe language . . . force and effect of law,\u201d which \u201cinvites a market\nparticipant analysis\u201d). We therefore have no occasion to consider\nwhether or when a preemption clause lacking such language would\nexcept a state or local government\u2019s proprietary actions.\n8    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwith the use of criminal penalties\u2014in imposing the plac-\nard and parking requirements at issue here. Consider\nagain how those requirements work. They are, to be sure,\ncontained in contracts between the Port and trucking\ncompanies. But those contracts do not stand alone, as the\nresult merely of the parties\u2019 voluntary commitments. The\nBoard of Harbor Commissioners aimed to \u201crequire parties\nwho access Port land and terminals for purposes of pro-\nviding drayage services\u201d to enter into concession agree-\nments with the Port. App. 108 (Board\u2019s \u201cFindings\u201d). And\nit accomplished that objective by amending the Port\u2019s\ntariff\u2014a form of municipal ordinance\u2014to provide that \u201cno\nTerminal Operator shall permit\u201d a drayage truck to gain\n\u201caccess into any Terminal in the Port\u201d unless the truck is\n\u201cregistered under\u201d such a concession agreement. Id., at\n105. A violation of that tariff provision is a violation of\ncriminal law. And it is punishable by a fine or a prison\nsentence of up to six months. Id., at 85\u201386. So the con-\ntract here functions as part and parcel of a governmental\nprogram wielding coercive power over private parties,\nbacked by the threat of criminal punishment.\n  That counts as action \u201chaving the force and effect of\nlaw\u201d if anything does. The Port here has not acted as a\nprivate party, contracting in a way that the owner of an\nordinary commercial enterprise could mimic. Rather, it\nhas forced terminal operators\u2014and through them, truck-\ning companies\u2014to alter their conduct by implementing a\ncriminal prohibition punishable by time in prison. In\nsome cases, the question whether governmental action has\nthe force of law may pose difficulties; the line between\nregulatory and proprietary conduct has soft edges. But\nthis case takes us nowhere near those uncertain bounda-\nries. Contractual commitments resulting not from ordi-\nnary bargaining (as in Wolens), but instead from the\nthreat of criminal sanctions manifest the government qua\ngovernment, performing its prototypical regulatory role.\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Port\u2019s primary argument to the contrary, like the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s, focuses on motive rather than means. The\nCourt of Appeals related how community opposition had\nfrustrated the Port\u2019s expansion, and concluded that the\nClean Truck Program \u201crespon[ded] to perceived business\nnecessity.\u201d 660 F. 3d, at 407. The Port tells the identical\nstory, emphasizing that private companies have similar\nbusiness incentives to \u201cadopt[ ] \u2018green growth\u2019 plans like\nthe Port\u2019s.\u201d Brief for City of Los Angeles 30. We have no\nreason to doubt that account of events; we can assume the\nPort acted to enhance goodwill and improve the odds of\nachieving its business plan\u2014just as a private company\nmight. But the Port\u2019s intentions are not what matters.\nThat is because, as we just described, the Port chose a tool\nto fulfill those goals which only a government can wield:\nthe hammer of the criminal law. See United Haulers\nAssn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.,\n438 F. 3d 150, 157 (CA2 2006), aff \u2019d, 550 U. S. 330 (2007).\nAnd when the government employs such a coercive mech-\nanism, available to no private party, it acts with the force\nand effect of law, whether or not it does so to turn a profit.\nOnly if it forgoes the (distinctively governmental) exercise\nof legal authority may it escape \u00a714501(c)(1)\u2019s preemptive\nscope.\n  The Port also tries another tack, reminding us that the\ncriminal sanctions here fall on terminal operators alone,\nnot on the trucking companies subject to the agreement\u2019s\nrequirements; hence, the Port maintains, the matter of\n\u201ccriminal penalties is a red herring.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 31;\nsee Brief for City of Los Angeles 39\u201340. But we fail to see\nwhy the target of the sanctions makes any difference. The\nPort selected an indirect but wholly effective means of\n\u201crequir[ing] parties . . . providing drayage services\u201d to\ndisplay placards and submit parking plans: To wit, the\nPort required terminal operators, on pain of criminal\npenalties, to insist that the truckers make those commit-\n10   AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nments. App. 108; see supra, at 3, 8. We have often rejected\nefforts by States to avoid preemption by shifting their\nregulatory focus from one company to another in the same\nsupply chain. See, e.g., Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor\nTransp. Assn., 552 U. S. 364, 371\u2013373 (2008) (finding\npreemption under the FAAAA although the State\u2019s re-\nquirements directly targeted retailers rather than motor\ncarriers); Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality\nManagement Dist., 541 U. S. 246, 255 (2004) (finding\npreemption under the Clean Air Act although the re-\nquirements directly targeted car buyers rather than\nsellers). The same goes here. The Port made its regula-\ntion of drayage trucks mandatory by imposing criminal\npenalties on the entities hiring all such trucks at the\nfacility. Slice it or dice it any which way, the Port thus\nacted with the \u201cforce of law.\u201d\n                              III\n  Our rejection of the concession agreement\u2019s placard and\nparking requirements does not conclude this case. Two\nother provisions of the agreement are now in effect: As\nnoted earlier, the Ninth Circuit upheld the financial-\ncapacity and truck-maintenance requirements, and that\npart of its decision has become final. See supra, at 5, and\nn. 2. ATA argues that our holding in Castle limits the way\nthe Port can enforce those remaining requirements. Ac-\ncording to ATA, the Port may not rely on the agreement\u2019s\npenalty provision to suspend or revoke the right of non-\ncomplying trucking companies to operate on the premises.\n  As we have described, Castle rebuffed a State\u2019s attempt\nto bar a federally licensed motor carrier from its highways\nfor past infringements of state safety regulations. A fed-\neral statute, we explained, gave a federal agency the\nauthority to license interstate motor carriers, as well as a\ncarefully circumscribed power to suspend or terminate\nthose licenses for violations of law. That statute, we held,\n                  Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimplicitly prohibited a State from \u201ctak[ing] action\u201d\u2014like a\nban on the use of its highways\u2014\u201camounting to a suspen-\nsion or revocation of an interstate carrier\u2019s [federally]\ngranted right to operate.\u201d 348 U. S., at 63\u201364.\n   The parties here dispute whether Castle restricts the\nPort\u2019s remedial authority. The Port echoes the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s view that banning a truck from \u201call of a State\u2019s\nfreeways\u201d is meaningfully different from denying it \u201caccess\nto a single Port.\u201d 660 F. 3d, at 403; see Brief for City of\nLos Angeles 49. ATA responds that because the Port is a\n\u201ccrucial channel of interstate commerce,\u201d Castle applies to\nit just as much as to roads. Brief for Petitioner 18.\n   But we see another question here: Does the Port\u2019s en-\nforcement scheme involve curtailing drayage trucks\u2019 oper-\nations in the way Castle prohibits, even assuming that\ndecision applies to facilities like this one? As just indicat-\ned, Castle puts limits on how a State or locality can punish\nan interstate motor carrier for prior violations of truck-\ning regulations (like the concession agreement\u2019s require-\nments). Nothing we said there, however, prevents a State\nfrom taking off the road a vehicle that is contemporane-\nously out of compliance with such regulations. Indeed,\nATA filed an amicus brief in Castle explaining that a\nvehicle \u201cthat fails to comply with the state\u2019s regulations\nmay be barred from the state\u2019s highways.\u201d Brief for ATA,\nO. T 1954, No. 44, p. 12; see Brief for Respondent, id.,\np. 23 (A State may \u201cstop and prevent from continuing on\nthe highway any motor vehicle which it finds not to be in\ncompliance\u201d). And ATA reiterates that view here, as does\nthe United States as amicus curiae. See Reply Brief 22;\nBrief for United States 29\u201330. So the Port would not\nviolate Castle if it barred a truck from operating at its\nfacilities to prevent an ongoing violation of the agree-\nment\u2019s requirements.\n   And at this juncture, we have no basis for finding that\nthe Port will ever use the agreement\u2019s penalty provision\n12   AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfor anything more than that. That provision, to be sure,\nmight be read to give the Port broader authority: As noted\nearlier, the relevant text enables the Port to suspend\nor revoke a trucking company\u2019s right to provide dray-\nage services at the facility as a \u201c[r]emedy\u201d for a \u201cMajor\nDefault.\u201d App. 82; see supra, at 3. But the agreement\nnowhere states what counts as a \u201cMajor Default\u201d\u2014and\nspecifically, whether a company\u2019s breach of the financial-\ncapacity or truck-maintenance requirements would qual-\nify. And the Port has in fact never used its suspension or\nrevocation power to penalize a past violation of those\nrequirements. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 50\u201351. Indeed, the\nPort\u2019s brief states that \u201cit does not claim[ ] the authority to\npunish past, cured violations of the requirements chal-\nlenged here through suspension or revocation.\u201d Brief for\nCity of Los Angeles 62 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nSo the kind of enforcement ATA fears, and believes incon-\nsistent with Castle, might never come to pass at all.\n   In these circumstances, we decide not to decide ATA\u2019s\nCastle-based challenge. That claim, by its nature, attacks\nthe Port\u2019s enforcement scheme.           But given the pre-\nenforcement posture of this case, we cannot tell what that\nscheme entails. It might look like the one forbidden in\nCastle (as ATA anticipates), or else it might not (as the\nPort assures us). We see no reason to take a guess now\nabout what the Port will do later. There will be time\nenough to address the Castle question when, if ever, the\nPort enforces its agreement in a way arguably violating\nthat decision.\n                            IV\n  Section 14501(c)(1) of the FAAAA preempts the placard\nand parking provisions of the Port\u2019s concession agreement.\nWe decline to decide on the present record ATA\u2019s separate\nchallenge, based on Castle, to that agreement\u2019s penalty\nprovision.

I write separately to\nhighlight a constitutional concern regarding \u00a7601 of the\nFederal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994\n(FAAAA), 108 Stat. 1606, a statute the Court has now\nconsidered twice this Term. See Dan\u2019s City Used Cars,\nInc. v. Pelkey, 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n   The Constitution grants Congress authority \u201c[t]o regu-\nlate Commerce . . . among the several States.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78,\ncl. 3 (emphasis added). Section 14501 of Title 49 is titled\n\u201cFederal authority over intrastate transportation.\u201d (Em-\nphasis added.) The tension between \u00a714501 and the\nConstitution is apparent, because the Constitution does\nnot give Congress power to regulate intrastate commerce.\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 587, n. 2 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring).        Nevertheless, \u00a714501(c)(1)\npurports to pre-empt any state or local law \u201crelated to\na price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with\nrespect to the transportation of property.\u201d By its terms,\n\u00a714501(c) would pre-empt even a city ordinance establish-\ning a uniform rate for most transportation services origi-\nnating and ending inside city limits, so long as the services\nwere provided by a motor carrier. Such an extraordinary\nassertion of congressional authority cannot be reconciled\n2    AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSNS., INC. v. LOS ANGELES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nwith our constitutional system of enumerated powers.\n   The Supremacy Clause provides the constitutional basis\nfor the pre-emption of state laws. Art. VI, cl. 2 (\u201cThis\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which\nshall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . shall be the su-\npreme Law of the Land\u201d). Because the Constitution and\nfederal laws are supreme, conflicting state laws are with-\nout legal effect. See Crosby v. National Foreign Trade\nCouncil, 530 U. S. 363, 372 (2000). However, the constitu-\ntional text leaves no doubt that only federal laws made \u201cin\nPursuance\u201d of the Constitution are supreme. See Gregory\nv. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991) (\u201cAs long as it is\nacting within the powers granted it under the Constitu-\ntion, Congress may impose its will on the States\u201d (empha-\nsis added)); Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555, 583\u2013587 (2009)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Given this limitation, Congress cannot pre-empt a state\nlaw merely by promulgating a conflicting statute\u2014the pre-\nempting statute must also be constitutional, both on its\nface and as applied. As relevant here, if Congress lacks\nauthority to enact a law regulating a particular intrastate\nactivity, it follows that Congress also lacks authority to\npre-empt state laws regulating that activity. See U. S.\nConst., Amdt. 10 (\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to\nthe people\u201d).\n   In this case, the Court concludes that \u201c[s]ection\n14501(c)(1) . . . preempts the placard and parking provi-\nsions of the Port\u2019s concession agreement.\u201d Ante, at 12.\nAlthough respondents waived any argument that Con-\ngress lacks authority to regulate the placards and parking\narrangements of drayage trucks using the port, I doubt\nthat Congress has such authority. The Court has iden-\ntified three categories of activity that Congress may\nregulate under the Commerce Clause: (1) the use of the\n                 Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nchannels of interstate commerce; (2) the instrumentalities\nof interstate commerce, and persons or things in interstate\ncommerce; and (3) \u201cactivities having a substantial relation\nto interstate commerce . . . i.e., those activities that sub-\nstantially affect interstate commerce.\u201d Lopez, supra, at\n558\u2013559. Drayage trucks that carry cargo into and out of\nthe Port of Los Angeles undoubtedly operate within the\n\u201cchannels of interstate commerce\u201d\u2014for that is what a port\nis. Congress can therefore regulate conduct taking place\nwithin the port. But it is doubtful whether Congress has\nthe power to decide where a drayage truck should park\nonce it has left the port or what kind of placard the truck\nshould display while offsite. Even under the \u201csubstantial\neffects\u201d test, which I have rejected as a \u201c \u2018rootless and\nmalleable standard\u2019 at odds with the constitutional de-\nsign,\u201d Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 67 (dissenting opin-\nion) (quoting United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n627 (2000) (THOMAS, J., concurring)), it is difficult to say\nthat placards and parking arrangements substantially af-\nfect interstate commerce. Congress made no findings\nindicating that offsite parking\u2014conduct that falls within\nthe scope of the States\u2019 traditional police powers\u2014\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce. And I doubt\nthat it could. Nevertheless, because respondents did not\npreserve a constitutional challenge to the FAAAA and\nbecause I agree that the provisions in question have the\n\u201cforce and effect of law,\u201d I join the Court\u2019s opinion.\n</pre>",
