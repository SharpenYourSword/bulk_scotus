TEXAS\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TEXAS\n\n            No. 12\u2013246.      Argued April 17, 2013\u2014Decided June 17, 2013\nPetitioner, without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warn-\n  ings, voluntarily answered some of a police officer\u2019s questions about a\n  murder, but fell silent when asked whether ballistics testing would\n  match his shotgun to shell casings found at the scene of the crime. At\n  petitioner\u2019s murder trial in Texas state court, and over his objection,\n  the prosecution used his failure to answer the question as evidence of\n  guilt. He was convicted, and both the State Court of Appeals and\n  Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, rejecting his claim that the pros-\n  ecution\u2019s use of his silence in its case in chief violated the Fifth\n  Amendment.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n369 S. W. 3d 176, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n  concluded that petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he\n  did not expressly invoke the privilege in response to the officer\u2019s\n  question. Pp. 3\u221212.\n     (a) To prevent the privilege against self-incrimination from shield-\n  ing information not properly within its scope, a witness who \u201c \u2018desires\n  the protection of the privilege . . . must claim it\u2019 \u201d at the time he relies\n  on it. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 427. This Court has rec-\n  ognized two exceptions to that requirement. First, a criminal de-\n  fendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own\n  trial. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613\u2013615. Petitioner\u2019s si-\n  lence falls outside this exception because he had no comparable un-\n  qualified right not to speak during his police interview. Second, a\n  witness\u2019 failure to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination\n  must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of\n  the privilege involuntary. See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n  436, 467\u2212468, and n. 37. Petitioner cannot benefit from this principle\n2                            SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    because it is undisputed that he agreed to accompany the officers to\n    the station and was free to leave at any time. Pp. 3\u22126.\n       (b) Petitioner seeks a third exception to the express invocation re-\n    quirement for cases where the witness chooses to stand mute rather\n    than give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating,\n    but this Court\u2019s cases all but foreclose that argument. A defendant\n    normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent. See Rob-\n    erts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560. And the express invocation\n    requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that\n    the answer to his question would incriminate the witness. See Mur-\n    phy, supra, at 427\u2212428. For the same reasons that neither a witness\u2019\n    silence nor official suspicion is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness\n    of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, they do not do so\n    together. The proposed exception also would be difficult to reconcile\n    with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370, where this Court held in\n    the closely related context of post-Miranda silence that a defendant\n    failed to invoke his right to cut off police questioning when he re-\n    mained silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Id., at ___.\n       Petitioner claims that reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is\n    the most likely explanation for silence in a case like his, but such si-\n    lence is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, 617.\n    To be sure, petitioner might have declined to answer the officer\u2019s\n    question in reliance on his constitutional privilege. But he also might\n    have done so because he was trying to think of a good lie, because he\n    was embarrassed, or because he was protecting someone else. Not\n    every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but\n    neither is every possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amend-\n    ment. Petitioner also suggests that it would be unfair to require a\n    suspect unschooled in the particulars of legal doctrine to do anything\n    more than remain silent in order to invoke his \u201cright to remain si-\n    lent.\u201d But the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no one may be\n    \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u201d not\n    an unqualified \u201cright to remain silent.\u201d In any event, it is settled\n    that forfeiture of the privilege against self-incrimination need not be\n    knowing. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427\u2013428. Pp. 6\u221210.\n       (c) Petitioner\u2019s argument that applying the express invocation re-\n    quirement in this context will be unworkable is also unpersuasive.\n    The Court has long required defendants to assert the privilege in or-\n    der to subsequently benefit from it, and this rule has not proved diffi-\n    cult to apply in practice. Pp. 10\u221212.\n       JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that peti-\n    tioner\u2019s claim would fail even if he invoked the privilege because the\n    prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his precustodial silence did not\n    compel him to give self-incriminating testimony.

TEXAS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL\n\n                   APPEALS OF TEXAS\n\n                                 [June 17, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY join.\n   Without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda\nwarnings, petitioner voluntarily answered the questions\nof a police officer who was investigating a murder. But\npetitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballis-\ntics test would show that the shell casings found at the\ncrime scene would match petitioner\u2019s shotgun. Petitioner\nwas subsequently charged with murder, and at trial pros-\necutors argued that his reaction to the officer\u2019s question\nsuggested that he was guilty. Petitioner claims that this\nargument violated the Fifth Amendment, which guaran-\ntees that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any crimi-\nnal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d\n   Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he\ndid not expressly invoke the privilege against self-\nincrimination in response to the officer\u2019s question. It has\nlong been settled that the privilege \u201cgenerally is not self-\nexecuting\u201d and that a witness who desires its protection\n\u201c \u2018must claim it.\u2019 \u201d Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420,\n425, 427 (1984) (quoting United States v. Monia, 317 U. S.\n2                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n424, 427 (1943)). Although \u201cno ritualistic formula is nec-\nessary in order to invoke the privilege,\u201d Quinn v. United\nStates, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955), a witness does not do so\nby simply standing mute. Because petitioner was required\nto assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the\njudgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting\npetitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.\n                                I\n  On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers\nwere shot and killed in their Houston home. There were\nno witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard\ngunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed\naway in a dark-colored car. Police recovered six shotgun\nshell casings at the scene. The investigation led police to\npetitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims\nhosted the night before they were killed. Police visited\npetitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in\nthe driveway. He agreed to hand over his shotgun for\nballistics testing and to accompany police to the station\nfor questioning.\n  Petitioner\u2019s interview with the police lasted approxi-\nmately one hour. All agree that the interview was noncusto-\ndial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption\nthat he was not read Miranda warnings. See Mi-\nranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). For most of the\ninterview, petitioner answered the officer\u2019s questions. But\nwhen asked whether his shotgun \u201cwould match the shells\nrecovered at the scene of the murder,\u201d App. 17, petitioner\ndeclined to answer. Instead, petitioner \u201c[l]ooked down at\nthe floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his\nhands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.\u201d Id., at 18.\nAfter a few moments of silence, the officer asked addition-\nal questions, which petitioner answered. Ibid.\n  Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on\noutstanding traffic warrants. Prosecutors soon concluded\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to charge him with\nthe murders, and he was released. A few days later, police\nobtained a statement from a man who said he had heard\npetitioner confess to the killings. On the strength of\nthat additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti-\ntioner, but by this time he had absconded. In 2007, police\ndiscovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an\nassumed name.\n   Petitioner did not testify at trial. Over his objection,\nprosecutors used his reaction to the officer\u2019s question dur-\ning the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt. The jury\nfound petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sen-\ntence. On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of\nTexas, petitioner argued that prosecutors\u2019 use of his si-\nlence as part of their case in chief violated the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court of Appeals rejected that argu-\nment, reasoning that petitioner\u2019s prearrest, pre-Miranda\nsilence was not \u201ccompelled\u201d within the meaning of the\nFifth Amendment. 368 S. W. 3d 550, 557\u2013559 (2011). The\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and\naffirmed on the same ground. 369 S. W. 3d 176 (2012).\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve\na division of authority in the lower courts over whether\nthe prosecution may use a defendant\u2019s assertion of the\nprivilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial\npolice interview as part of its case in chief. Compare, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rivera, 944 F. 2d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991),\nwith United States v. Moore, 104 F. 3d 377, 386 (CADC\n1997). But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege\nduring his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that\nquestion.\n                             II\n                              A\n  The privilege against self-incrimination \u201cis an exception\nto the general principle that the Government has the right\n4                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nto everyone\u2019s testimony.\u201d Garner v. United States, 424\nU. S. 648, 658, n. 11 (1976). To prevent the privilege from\nshielding information not properly within its scope, we\nhave long held that a witness who \u201c \u2018desires the protection\nof the privilege . . . must claim it\u2019 \u201d at the time he relies on\nit. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U. S., at\n427). See also United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commis-\nsioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927).\n   That requirement ensures that the Government is put\non notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege\nso that it may either argue that the testimony sought\ncould not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or cure any potential\nself-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kasti-\ngar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 448 (1972). The ex-\npress invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with\nevaluating a Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous\nrecord establishing the witness\u2019 reasons for refusing to\nanswer. See Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560,\nn. 7 (1980) (\u201cA witness may not employ the privilege to\navoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not\nto give\u201d); Hutcheson v. United States, 369 U. S. 599, 610\u2013\n611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as\nproper assertion of the privilege). In these ways, insisting\nthat witnesses expressly invoke the privilege \u201cassures that\nthe Government obtains all the information to which it is\nentitled.\u201d Garner, supra, at 658, n. 11.\n   We have previously recognized two exceptions to the\nrequirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but\nneither applies here. First, we held in Griffin v. Califor-\nnia, 380 U. S. 609, 613\u2013615 (1965), that a criminal de-\nfendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at\nhis own trial. That exception reflects the fact that a crim-\ninal defendant has an \u201cabsolute right not to testify.\u201d\nTurner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398, 433 (1970) (Black,\nJ., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n637 (2004) (plurality opinion). Since a defendant\u2019s reasons\nfor remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitu-\ntional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke\nthe privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing\nthat his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a\ngrant of immunity could force him to speak. Because pe-\ntitioner had no comparable unqualified right during his\ninterview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin\nexception.\n   Second, we have held that a witness\u2019 failure to invoke\nthe privilege must be excused where governmental coer-\ncion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.\nThus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected\nto the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of an unwarned\ncustodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege. 384\nU. S., at 467\u2013468, and n. 37. Due to the uniquely coercive\nnature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody\ncannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege\n\u201cunless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.\u201d\nMurphy, supra, at 429\u2013430.\n   For similar reasons, we have held that threats to with-\ndraw a governmental benefit such as public employment\nsometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it\nneed not be affirmatively asserted. Garrity v. New Jersey,\n385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967) (public employment). See also\nLefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802\u2013804 (1977)\n(public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 84\u201385\n(1973) (public contracts). And where assertion of the\nprivilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed\nwitnesses to exercise the privilege through silence. See,\ne.g., Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28\u201329 (1969) (no\nrequirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing\nso would have revealed income from illegal activities);\nAlbertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 382 U. S.\n70, 77\u201379 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not\nrequired to complete registration form \u201cwhere response to\n6                    SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nany of the form\u2019s questions . . . might involve [them] in the\nadmission of a crucial element of a crime\u201d). The principle\nthat unites all of those cases is that a witness need not\nexpressly invoke the privilege where some form of official\ncompulsion denies him \u201ca \u2018free choice to admit, to deny,\nor to refuse to answer.\u2019 \u201d Garner, 424 U. S., at 656\u2013657\n(quoting Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941)).\n   Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it\nis undisputed that his interview with police was volun-\ntary. As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to\naccompany the officers to the station and \u201cwas free to\nleave at any time during the interview.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 2\u20133 (internal quotation marks omitted). That places\npetitioner\u2019s situation outside the scope of Miranda and\nother cases in which we have held that various forms of\ngovernmental coercion prevented defendants from volun-\ntarily invoking the privilege. The dissent elides this point\nwhen it cites our precedents in this area for the proposi-\ntion that \u201c[c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation,\ntrigger the protection of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Post,\nat 7\u20138 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The critical question is\nwhether, under the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of this case, petitioner\nwas deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the Fifth\nAmendment. He was not. We have before us no allegation\nthat petitioner\u2019s failure to assert the privilege was invol-\nuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to\nsay that he was not answering the officer\u2019s question on\nFifth Amendment grounds. Because he failed to do so, the\nprosecution\u2019s use of his noncustodial silence did not violate\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n                             B\n   Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in-\nvocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands\nmute and thereby declines to give an answer that of-\nficials suspect would be incriminating. Our cases all but\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nforeclose such an exception, which would needlessly bur-\nden the Government\u2019s interests in obtaining testimony\nand prosecuting criminal activity. We therefore decline\npetitioner\u2019s invitation to craft a new exception to the\n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d that a witness must assert the privilege to\nsubsequently benefit from it. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 429.\n   Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not\ninvoke the privilege by remaining silent. In Roberts v.\nUnited States, 445 U. S. 552, for example, we rejected the\nFifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained\nsilent throughout a police investigation and received a\nharsher sentence for his failure to cooperate. In so ruling,\nwe explained that \u201cif [the defendant] believed that his\nfailure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so\nat a time when the sentencing court could have deter-\nmined whether his claim was legitimate.\u201d Id., at 560. See\nalso United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 263\u2013264\n(1927); Vajtauer, 273 U. S., at 113.1 A witness does not\nexpressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.\n   We have also repeatedly held that the express invoca-\ntion requirement applies even when an official has reason\nto suspect that the answer to his question would incrim-\ninate the witness. Thus, in Murphy we held that the\ndefendant\u2019s self-incriminating answers to his probation of-\nficer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to\ninvoke the privilege. 465 U. S., at 427\u2013428. In reaching\nthat conclusion, we rejected the notion \u201cthat a witness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent argues that in these cases \u201cneither the nature of the\n\nquestions nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided\nany basis to infer a tie between the silence and the Fifth Amendment.\u201d\nPost, at 5\u20136 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But none of our precedents sug-\ngests that governmental officials are obliged to guess at the meaning of\na witness\u2019 unexplained silence when implicit reliance on the Fifth\nAmendment seems probable. Roberts does not say as much, despite its\nholding that the defendant in that case was required to explain the\nFifth Amendment basis for his failure to cooperate with an investiga-\ntion that led to his prosecution. 445 U. S., at 559.\n8                         SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nmust \u2018put the Government on notice by formally availing\nhimself of the privilege\u2019 only when he alone \u2018is reasonably\naware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 428 (quoting Roberts, supra, at 562, n.* (Brennan,\nJ., concurring)). See also United States v. Kordel, 397\nU. S. 1, 7 (1970).2\n   Petitioner does not dispute the vitality of either of those\nlines of precedent but instead argues that we should adopt\nan exception for cases at their intersection. Thus, peti-\ntioner would have us hold that although neither a wit-\nness\u2019 silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse\nthe express invocation requirement, the invocation require-\nment does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of\nofficial suspicions. For the same reasons that neither\nof those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of\nthe obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we con-\nclude that they do not do so together. A contrary result\nwould do little to protect those genuinely relying on the\nFifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new\nburden on society\u2019s interest in the admission of evidence\nthat is probative of a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt.\n   Petitioner\u2019s proposed exception would also be very diffi-\ncult to reconcile with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S.\n370 (2010). There, we held in the closely related context of\npost-Miranda silence that a defendant failed to invoke the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Our cases do not support the distinction the dissent draws between\n\nsilence and the failure to invoke the privilege before making incriminat-\ning statements. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissenting). For example,\nMurphy, a case in which the witness made incriminating statements\nafter failing to invoke the privilege, repeatedly relied on Roberts\nand Vajtauer\u2014two cases in which witnesses remained silent and did\nnot make incriminating statements. 465 U. S., at 427, 429, 455\u2013456,\nn. 20. Similarly, Kordel cited Vajtauer, among other cases, for the\nproposition that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure at any time to assert the\nconstitutional privilege leaves him in no position to complain now that\nhe was compelled to give testimony against himself.\u201d 397 U. S., at 10,\nand n. 18.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3, 8\u201310). If the extended custodial silence in that case did\nnot invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary si-\nlence in this case did not do so either.\n   Petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish Berg-\nhuis by observing that it did not concern the admissi-\nbility of the defendant\u2019s silence but instead involved the\nadmissibility of his subsequent statements. Post, at 8\u20139\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). But regardless of whether prose-\ncutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows, the\nlogic of Berghuis applies with equal force: A suspect who\nstands mute has not done enough to put police on notice\nthat he is relying on his Fifth Amendment privilege.3\n   In support of their proposed exception to the invocation\nrequirement, petitioner and the dissent argue that reli-\nance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is the most likely\nexplanation for silence in a case such as this one. Reply\nBrief 17; see post, at 9\u201310 (BREYER, J., dissenting). But\nwhatever the most probable explanation, such silence is\n\u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d See Doyle, v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610,\n617 (1976). To be sure, someone might decline to answer a\npolice officer\u2019s question in reliance on his constitutional\nprivilege. But he also might do so because he is trying to\nthink of a good lie, because he is embarrassed, or because\nhe is protecting someone else. Not every such possible\nexplanation for silence is probative of guilt, but neither is\nevery possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amend-\nment. Petitioner alone knew why he did not answer the\nofficer\u2019s question, and it was therefore his \u201cburden . . . to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioner is correct that due process prohibits prosecutors from\n\npointing to the fact that a defendant was silent after he heard Miranda\nwarnings, Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, 617\u2013618 (1976), but that rule\ndoes not apply where a suspect has not received the warnings\u2019 implicit\npromise that any silence will not be used against him, Jenkins v.\nAnderson, 447 U.

S. 433, 439 (1974)\n(observing that \u201cvirtually every schoolboy is familiar with\nthe concept, if not the language\u201d of the Fifth Amendment).\nBut popular misconceptions notwithstanding, the Fifth\nAmendment guarantees that no one may be \u201ccompelled in\nany criminal case to be a witness against himself \u201d; it does\nnot establish an unqualified \u201cright to remain silent.\u201d A\nwitness\u2019 constitutional right to refuse to answer questions\ndepends on his reasons for doing so, and courts need to\nknow those reasons to evaluate the merits of a Fifth\nAmendment claim. See Hoffman, 341 U. S., at 486\u2013487.4\n   In any event, it is settled that forfeiture of the privilege\nagainst self-incrimination need not be knowing. Murphy,\n465 U.

But we have\nnever said that the government must demonstrate such a need on a\ncase-by-case basis for the invocation requirement to apply.

Petitioner\nand the dissent suggest that our approach will \u201cunleash\ncomplicated and persistent litigation\u201d over what a suspect\nmust say to invoke the privilege, Reply Brief 18; see post,\nat 11\u201312 (opinion of BREYER, J.), but our cases have\nlong required that a witness assert the privilege to subse-\nquently benefit from it. That rule has not proved difficult to\napply. Nor did the potential for close cases dissuade us\nfrom adopting similar invocation requirements for sus-\npects who wish to assert their rights and cut off police\nquestioning during custodial interviews. Berghuis, 560\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8\u201310) (requiring suspect to unam-\nbiguously assert privilege against self-incrimination to cut\noff custodial questioning); Davis v.

S. 452, 459 (1994) (same standard for assertions of the\nright to counsel).\n   Notably, petitioner\u2019s approach would produce its own\nline-drawing problems, as this case vividly illustrates.\nWhen the interviewing officer asked petitioner if his\nshotgun would match the shell casings found at the crime\nscene, petitioner did not merely remain silent; he made\nmovements that suggested surprise and anxiety. At pre-\ncisely what point such reactions transform \u201csilence\u201d into\nexpressive conduct would be a difficult and recurring\nquestion that our decision allows us to avoid.\n   We also reject petitioner\u2019s argument that an express\ninvocation requirement will encourage police officers to\n\u201c \u2018unfairly \u201ctric[k]\u201d \u2019 \u201d suspects into cooperating.

The plurality\navoids reaching that question and instead concludes that\nSalinas\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not\nexpressly invoke the privilege. Ante, at 3. I think there is\na simpler way to resolve this case. In my view, Salinas\u2019\nclaim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege be-\ncause the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his precusto-\ndial silence did not compel him to give self-incriminating\ntestimony.\n   In Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), this Court\nheld that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor or\njudge from commenting on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\nId., at 614. The Court reasoned that such comments, and\nany adverse inferences drawn from them, are a \u201cpenalty\u201d\nimposed on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amend-\nment privilege. Ibid. Salinas argues that we should\nextend Griffin\u2019s no-adverse-inference rule to a defendant\u2019s\nsilence during a precustodial interview. I have previously\nexplained that the Court\u2019s decision in Griffin \u201clacks foun-\ndation in the Constitution\u2019s text, history, or logic\u201d and\nshould not be extended. See Mitchell v. United States, 526\n2                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. 314, 341 (1999) (dissenting opinion). I adhere to that\nview today.\n   Griffin is impossible to square with the text of the Fifth\nAmendment, which provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be\ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself.\u201d A defendant is not \u201ccompelled . . . to be a witness\nagainst himself \u201d simply because a jury has been told that\nit may draw an adverse inference from his silence. See\nMitchell, supra, at 331 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nthreat of an adverse inference does not \u2018compel\u2019 anyone to\ntestify. . . . Indeed, I imagine that in most instances, a\nguilty defendant would choose to remain silent despite\nthe adverse inference, on the theory that it would do\nhim less damage than his cross-examined testimony\u201d);\nCarter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 306 (1981) (Powell,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[N]othing in the [Self-Incrimination]\nClause requires that jurors not draw logical inferences\nwhen a defendant chooses not to explain incriminating\ncircumstances\u201d).\n   Nor does the history of the Fifth Amendment support\nGriffin. At the time of the founding, English and Ameri-\ncan courts strongly encouraged defendants to give un-\nsworn statements and drew adverse inferences when they\nfailed to do so. See Mitchell, supra, at 332 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting); Alschuler, A Peculiar Privilege in Historical\nPerspective, in The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination\n204 (R. Hemholz et al. eds. 1997). Given Griffin\u2019s indefen-\nsible foundation, I would not extend it to a defendant\u2019s\nsilence during a precustodial interview. I agree with the\nplurality that Salinas\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim fails and,\ntherefore, concur in the judgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And I dissent from the\nCourt\u2019s contrary conclusion.\n                               I\n   In January 1993, Houston police began to suspect peti-\ntioner Genovevo Salinas of having committed two murders\nthe previous month. They asked Salinas to come to the\npolice station \u201cto take photographs and to clear him as [a]\nsuspect.\u201d App. 3. At the station, police took Salinas into\nwhat he describes as \u201can interview room.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 3. Because he was \u201cfree to leave at that time,\u201d App.\n14, they did not give him Miranda warnings. The police\nthen asked Salinas questions. And Salinas answered until\nthe police asked him whether the shotgun from his home\n\u201cwould match the shells recovered at the scene of the\nmurder.\u201d Id., at 17. At that point Salinas fell silent. Ibid.\n   Salinas was later tried for, and convicted of, murder. At\nclosing argument, drawing on testimony he had elicited\nearlier, the prosecutor pointed out to the jury that Salinas,\nduring his earlier questioning at the police station, had\nremained silent when asked about the shotgun. The\nprosecutor told the jury, among other things, that \u201c \u2018[a]n\n2                    SALINAS v.

The plurality\nbelieves that the Amendment does not bar the evidence\nand comments because Salinas \u201cdid not expressly invoke\nthe privilege against self-incrimination\u201d when he fell silent\nduring the questioning at the police station. Ante, at 1.\nBut, in my view, that conclusion is inconsistent with this\nCourt\u2019s case law and its underlying practical rationale.\n                             A\n  The Fifth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from com-\nmenting on an individual\u2019s silence where that silence\namounts to an effort to avoid becoming \u201ca witness against\nhimself.\u201d This Court has specified that \u201ca rule of evidence\u201d\npermitting \u201ccommen[t] . . . by counsel\u201d in a criminal case\nupon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify \u201cviolates the Fifth\nAmendment.\u201d Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 610,\nn. 2, 613 (1965) (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 637 (2004)\n(plurality opinion); Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398,\n433 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting). And, since \u201cit is imper-\nmissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth\nAmendment privilege when he is under police custodial\ninterrogation,\u201d the \u201cprosecution may not . . . use at trial\nthe fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the\nface of accusation.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,\n468, n. 37 (1966) (emphasis added).\n  Particularly in the context of police interrogation, a\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary rule would undermine the basic protection that\nthe Fifth Amendment provides. Cf. Kastigar v. United\nStates, 406 U. S. 441, 461 (1972) (\u201cThe privilege . . . usu-\nally operates to allow a citizen to remain silent when asked\na question requiring an incriminatory answer\u201d). To permit\na prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s constitutionally\nprotected silence would put that defendant in an impossi-\nble predicament. He must either answer the question or\nremain silent. If he answers the question, he may well\nreveal, for example, prejudicial facts, disreputable associ-\nates, or suspicious circumstances\u2014even if he is innocent.\nSee, e.g., Griffin, supra, at 613; Kassin, Inside Interroga-\ntion: Why Innocent People Confess, 32 Am. J. Trial Advoc.\n525, 537 (2009). If he remains silent, the prosecutor may\nwell use that silence to suggest a consciousness of guilt.\nAnd if the defendant then takes the witness stand in order\nto explain either his speech or his silence, the prosecution\nmay introduce, say for impeachment purposes, a prior\nconviction that the law would otherwise make inadmissi-\nble. Thus, where the Fifth Amendment is at issue, to\nallow comment on silence directly or indirectly can compel\nan individual to act as \u201ca witness against himself \u201d\u2014very\nmuch what the Fifth Amendment forbids. Cf. Pennsylva-\nnia v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 596\u2013597 (1990) (definition of\n\u201ctestimonial\u201d includes responses to questions that require\na suspect to communicate an express or implied assertion\nof fact or belief). And that is similarly so whether the\nquestioned individual, as part of his decision to remain\nsilent, invokes the Fifth Amendment explicitly or implic-\nitly, through words, through deeds, or through reference to\nsurrounding circumstances.\n                            B\n  It is consequently not surprising that this Court, more\nthan half a century ago, explained that \u201cno ritualistic\nformula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d\n4                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nQuinn v. United States, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955). Thus,\na prosecutor may not comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to\ntestify at trial\u2014even if neither the defendant nor anyone\nelse ever mentions a Fifth Amendment right not to do so.\nCircumstances, not a defendant\u2019s statement, tie the de-\nfendant\u2019s silence to the right. Similarly, a prosecutor may\nnot comment on the fact that a defendant in custody, after\nreceiving Miranda warnings, \u201cstood mute\u201d\u2014regardless of\nwhether he \u201cclaimed his privilege\u201d in so many words.\nMiranda, supra, at 468, n. 37. Again, it is not any explicit\nstatement but, instead, the defendant\u2019s deeds (silence) and\ncircumstances (receipt of the warnings) that tie together\nsilence and constitutional right. Most lower courts have so\nconstrued the law, even where the defendant, having\nreceived Miranda warnings, answers some questions\nwhile remaining silent as to others. See, e.g., Hurd v.\nTerhune, 619 F. 3d 1080, 1087 (CA9 2010); United States\nv. May, 52 F. 3d 885, 890 (CA10 1995); United States v.\nScott, 47 F. 3d 904, 907 (CA7 1995); United States v. Can-\nterbury, 985 F. 2d 483, 486 (CA10 1993); Grieco v. Hall,\n641 F. 2d 1029, 1034 (CA1 1981); United States v. Ghiz,\n491 F. 2d 599, 600 (CA4 1974). But see, e.g., United States\nv. Harris, 956 F. 2d 177, 181 (CA8 1992).\n   The cases in which this Court has insisted that a de-\nfendant expressly mention the Fifth Amendment by name\nin order to rely on its privilege to protect silence are cases\nwhere (1) the circumstances surrounding the silence (un-\nlike the present case) did not give rise to an inference that\nthe defendant intended, by his silence, to exercise his Fifth\nAmendment rights; and (2) the questioner greeted by the\nsilence (again unlike the present case) had a special need\nto know whether the defendant sought to rely on the\nprotections of the Fifth Amendment.

These\ncases include Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, Vajtauer, and\nJenkins\u2014all of which at least do involve the protection of\nsilence\u2014and also include cases emphasized by the plural-\nity that are not even about silence\u2014namely, Murphy and\nGarner.\n   In Roberts and Rogers, the individual refused to answer\nquestions that government investigators (in Roberts) and a\ngrand jury (in Rogers) asked, principally because the\nindividual wanted to avoid incriminating other persons.\nRoberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 553\u2013556 (1980);\nRogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 368\u2013370, and n. 4\n(1951). But the Fifth Amendment does not protect some-\none from incriminating others; it protects against self-\nincrimination. In turn, neither the nature of the questions\nnor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them pro-\nvided any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the\nFifth Amendment, while knowledge of any such tie would\nhave proved critical to the questioner\u2019s determination as to\nwhether the defendant had any proper legal basis for\nclaiming Fifth Amendment protection.\n   In Sullivan, the defendant\u2019s silence consisted of his\nfailure to file a tax return\u2014a return, he later claimed, that\nwould have revealed his illegal activity as a bootlegger.\nUnited States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 262\u2013264 (1927).\nThe circumstances did not give rise to an inference of a tie\nbetween his silence (in the form of failing to file a tax\nreturn) and the Fifth Amendment; and, if he really did\nwant to rely on the Fifth Amendment, then the govern-\nment would have had special need to know of any such tie\nin order to determine whether, for example, the assertion\nof privilege was valid and, perhaps, an offer of immunity\nwas appropriate.\n   In Vajtauer, an alien refused to answer questions asked\nby an immigration official at a deportation proceeding.\n6                    SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immi-\ngration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927). Here, the circumstances\ngave rise to a distinct inference that the alien was not\ninvoking any Fifth Amendment privilege: The alien\u2019s\nlawyer had stated quite publicly at the hearing that he\nadvised his client to remain silent not on Fifth Amend-\nment grounds; rather, the lawyer \u201c \u2018advise[d] the alien not\nto answer any further questions until the evidence upon\nwhich the warrant is based will be presented here.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 106\u2013107 (quoting the lawyer). This statement weak-\nened or destroyed the possibility of a silence-Fifth\nAmendment linkage; the Government could not challenge\nhis right to invoke the Fifth Amendment; and this Court\ndescribed its later invocation as \u201cevidently an after-\nthought.\u201d Id., at 113.\n  Perhaps most illustrative is Jenkins, a case upon which\nthe plurality relies, ante, at 9, n. 3, and upon which the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals relied almost exclusively,\n369 S. W. 3d 176, 178\u2013179 (2012). Jenkins killed some-\none, and was not arrested until he turned himself in two\nweeks later. Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 232\n(1980). On cross-examination at his trial, Jenkins claimed\nthat his killing was in self-defense after being attacked.\nId., at 232\u2013233. The prosecutor then asked why he did not\nreport the alleged attack, and in closing argument sug-\ngested that Jenkins\u2019 failure to do so cast doubt on his\nclaim to have acted in self-defense. Id., at 233\u2013234. We\nexplained that this unusual form of \u201cprearrest silence\u201d\nwas not constitutionally protected from use at trial. Id., at\n240. Perhaps even more aptly, Justice Stevens\u2019 concur-\nrence noted that \u201cthe privilege against compulsory self-\nincrimination is simply irrelevant\u201d in such circumstances.\u201d\nId., at 241 (footnote omitted). How would anyone have\nknown that Jenkins, while failing to report an attack, was\nrelying on the Fifth Amendment? And how would the\ngovernment have had any way of determining whether his\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nclaim was valid? In Jenkins, as in Roberts, Rogers, Sulli-\nvan, and Vajtauer, no one had any reason to connect si-\nlence to the Fifth Amendment; and the government had no\nopportunity to contest any alleged connection.\n   Still further afield from today\u2019s case are Murphy and\nGarner, neither of which involved silence at all. Rather, in\nboth cases, a defendant had earlier answered questions\nposed by the government\u2014in Murphy, by speaking with a\nprobation officer, and in Garner, by completing a tax\nreturn. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 422\u2013425\n(1984); Garner v. United States, 424 U. S. 648, 649\u2013650\n(1976). At the time of providing answers, neither circum-\nstances nor deeds nor words suggested reliance on the\nFifth Amendment: Murphy simply answered questions\nposed by his probation officer; Garner simply filled out a\ntax return.      They did not argue that their self-\nincriminating statements had been \u201ccompelled\u201d in viola-\ntion of the Fifth Amendment until later, at trial. Murphy,\nsupra, at 425, 431; Garner, supra, at 649, 665. The Court\nheld that those statements were not compelled. Murphy,\nsupra, at 440; Garner, supra, at 665. The circumstances\nindicated that the defendants had affirmatively chosen to\nspeak and to write.\n   Thus, we have two sets of cases: One where express\ninvocation of the Fifth Amendment was not required to tie\none\u2019s silence to its protections, and another where some-\nthing like express invocation was required, because cir-\ncumstances demanded some explanation for the silence\n(or the statements) in order to indicate that the Fifth\nAmendment was at issue.\n   There is also a third set of cases, cases that may well fit\ninto the second category but where the Court has held that\nthe Fifth Amendment both applies and does not require\nexpress invocation despite ambiguous circumstances. The\nCourt in those cases has made clear that an individual,\nwhen silent, need not expressly invoke the Fifth Amend-\n8                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment if there are \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d not to\ndo so. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467. Thus, in Garrity v.\nNew Jersey, 385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967), the Court held that\nno explicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment was required\nwhere, in the course of an investigation, such assertion\nwould, by law, have cost police officers their jobs. Similarly,\nthis Court did not require explicit assertion in response\nto a grand jury subpoena where that assertion would have\ncost two architects their public contracts or a political\nofficial his job. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 75\u201376\n(1973); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802\u2013804\n(1977). In Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28\u201329\n(1969), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not\nrequire explicit assertion of the privilege against self-\nincrimination because, in the context of the Marihuana\nTax Act, such assertion would have been inherently in-\ncriminating. In Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control\nBd., 382 U. S. 70, 77\u201379 (1965), we held the same where\nexplicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment would have\nrequired, as a first step, the potentially incriminating\nadmission of membership in the Communist Party. The\nCourt has also held that gamblers, without explicitly\ninvoking the Fifth Amendment, need not comply with tax\nrequirements that would, inherently and directly, lead to\nself-incrimination. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S.\n39, 60\u201361 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62,\n67\u201368 (1968). All told, this third category of cases receives\nthe same treatment as the first: Circumstances, rather\nthan explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the Fifth\nAmendment. So, too, in today\u2019s case.\n  The plurality refers to one additional case, namely\nBerghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370 (2010). See ante, at\n8. But that case is here beside the point. In Berghuis, the\ndefendant was in custody, he had been informed of his\nMiranda rights, and he was subsequently silent in the\nface of 2 hours and 45 minutes of questioning before he\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\noffered any substantive answers. Id., at ___\u2013___ (slip op.,\nat 2\u20134). The Court held that he had waived his Fifth\nAmendment rights in respect to his later speech. The\nCourt said nothing at all about a prosecutor\u2019s right to\ncomment on his preceding silence and no prosecutor\nsought to do so. Indeed, how could a prosecutor lawfully\nhave tried to do so, given this Court\u2019s statement in Mi-\nranda itself that a prosecutor cannot comment on the fact\nthat, after receiving Miranda warnings, the suspect \u201cstood\nmute\u201d? 384 U. S., at 468, n. 37.\n  We end where we began. \u201c[N]o ritualistic formula is\nnecessary in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d Quinn, 349\nU. S., at 164. Much depends on the circumstances of the\nparticular case, the most important circumstances being:\n(1) whether one can fairly infer that the individual being\nquestioned is invoking the Amendment\u2019s protection; (2) if\nthat is unclear, whether it is particularly important for\nthe questioner to know whether the individual is doing so;\nand (3) even if it is, whether, in any event, there is a good\nreason for excusing the individual from referring to the\nFifth Amendment, such as inherent penalization simply\nby answering.\n                             C\n  Applying these principles to the present case, I would\nhold that Salinas need not have expressly invoked the\nFifth Amendment. The context was that of a criminal\ninvestigation. Police told Salinas that and made clear that\nhe was a suspect. His interrogation took place at the\npolice station. Salinas was not represented by counsel.\nThe relevant question\u2014about whether the shotgun from\nSalinas\u2019 home would incriminate him\u2014amounted to a\nswitch in subject matter. And it was obvious that the new\nquestion sought to ferret out whether Salinas was guilty of\nmurder. See 368 S. W. 3d, at 552\u2013553.\n  These circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference\n10                   SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat Salinas\u2019 silence derived from an exercise of his Fifth\nAmendment rights. This Court has recognized repeatedly\nthat many, indeed most, Americans are aware that they\nhave a constitutional right not to incriminate themselves\nby answering questions posed by the police during an\ninterrogation conducted in order to figure out the perpe-\ntrator of a crime. See Dickerson v. United States, 530\nU. S. 428, 443 (2000); Brogan v. United States, 522 U. S.\n398, 405 (1998); Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 439\n(1974). The nature of the surroundings, the switch of\ntopic, the particular question\u2014all suggested that the right\nwe have and generally know we have was at issue at the\ncritical moment here. Salinas, not being represented by\ncounsel, would not likely have used the precise words\n\u201cFifth Amendment\u201d to invoke his rights because he would\nnot likely have been aware of technical legal require-\nments, such as a need to identify the Fifth Amendment by\nname.\n  At the same time, the need to categorize Salinas\u2019 silence\nas based on the Fifth Amendment is supported here by the\npresence, in full force, of the predicament I discussed\nearlier, namely that of not forcing Salinas to choose be-\ntween incrimination through speech and incrimination\nthrough silence. That need is also supported by the ab-\nsence of any special reason that the police had to know,\nwith certainty, whether Salinas was, in fact, relying on the\nFifth Amendment\u2014such as whether to doubt that there\nreally was a risk of self-incrimination, see Hoffman v.\nUnited States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or whether to\ngrant immunity, see Kastigar, 406 U. S., at 448. Given\nthese circumstances, Salinas\u2019 silence was \u201csufficient to put\nthe [government] on notice of an apparent claim of the\nprivilege.\u201d Quinn, supra, at 164. That being so, for rea-\nsons similar to those given in Griffin, the Fifth Amend-\nment bars the evidence of silence admitted against Salinas\nand mentioned by the prosecutor. See 380 U. S., at 614\u2013615.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              D\n\n   I recognize that other cases may arise where facts and\ncircumstances surrounding an individual\u2019s silence present\na closer question. The critical question\u2014whether those\ncircumstances give rise to a fair inference that the silence\nrests on the Fifth Amendment\u2014will not always prove easy\nto administer. But that consideration does not support the\nplurality\u2019s rule-based approach here, for the administra-\ntive problems accompanying the plurality\u2019s approach are\neven worse.\n   The plurality says that a suspect must \u201cexpressly invoke\nthe privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Ante, at 1. But\ndoes it really mean that the suspect must use the exact\nwords \u201cFifth Amendment\u201d? How can an individual who is\nnot a lawyer know that these particular words are legally\nmagic? Nor does the Solicitor General help when he adds\nthat the suspect may \u201cmak[e] the claim \u2018in any language\nthat [the questioner] may reasonably be expected to un-\nderstand as an attempt to invoke the privilege.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22 (quoting Quinn, supra,\nat 162\u2013163; alteration in original). What counts as \u201cmak-\ning the claim\u201d? Suppose the individual says, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss\nsomething else,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to answer that\u201d; or\nsuppose he just gets up and leaves the room. Cf. Davis v.\nMississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 727, n. 6 (1969) (affirming \u201cthe\nsettled principle that while the police have the right to\nrequest citizens to answer voluntarily questions concern-\ning unsolved crimes[,] they have no right to compel them\nto answer\u201d); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439\n(1984) (noting that even someone detained in a Terry stop\n\u201cis not obliged to respond\u201d to police questions); Florida v.\nRoyer, 460 U. S. 491, 497\u2013498 (1983) (plurality opinion).\nHow is simple silence in the present context any different?\n   The basic problem for the plurality is that an effort to\nhave a simple, clear \u201cexplicit statement\u201d rule poses a\nserious obstacle to those who, like Salinas, seek to assert\n12                   SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntheir basic Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, for\nthey are likely unaware of any such linguistic detail. At\nthe same time, acknowledging that our case law does not\nrequire use of specific words, see ante, at 2, leaves the\nplurality without the administrative benefits it might\nhope to find in requiring that detail.\n   Far better, in my view, to pose the relevant question\ndirectly: Can one fairly infer from an individual\u2019s silence\nand surrounding circumstances an exercise of the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s privilege? The need for simplicity, the\nconstitutional importance of applying the Fifth Amend-\nment to those who seek its protection, and this Court\u2019s\ncase law all suggest that this is the right question to ask\nhere. And the answer to that question in the circumstances\nof today\u2019s case is clearly: yes.\n   For these reasons, I believe that the Fifth Amendment\nprohibits a prosecutor from commenting on Salinas\u2019s\nsilence. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n",

Argued April 17, 2013\u2014Decided June 17, 2013\nPetitioner, without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda warn-\n  ings, voluntarily answered some of a police officer\u2019s questions about a\n  murder, but fell silent when asked whether ballistics testing would\n  match his shotgun to shell casings found at the scene of the crime. At\n  petitioner\u2019s murder trial in Texas state court, and over his objection,\n  the prosecution used his failure to answer the question as evidence of\n  guilt. He was convicted, and both the State Court of Appeals and\n  Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, rejecting his claim that the pros-\n  ecution\u2019s use of his silence in its case in chief violated the Fifth\n  Amendment.\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\n369 S. W. 3d 176, affirmed.\n     JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE KENNEDY,\n  concluded that petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he\n  did not expressly invoke the privilege in response to the officer\u2019s\n  question. Pp. 3\u221212.\n     (a) To prevent the privilege against self-incrimination from shield-\n  ing information not properly within its scope, a witness who \u201c \u2018desires\n  the protection of the privilege . . . must claim it\u2019 \u201d at the time he relies\n  on it. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 427. This Court has rec-\n  ognized two exceptions to that requirement. First, a criminal de-\n  fendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own\n  trial. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613\u2013615. Petitioner\u2019s si-\n  lence falls outside this exception because he had no comparable un-\n  qualified right not to speak during his police interview. Second, a\n  witness\u2019 failure to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination\n  must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of\n  the privilege involuntary. See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.\n  436, 467\u2212468, and n. 37. Petitioner cannot benefit from this principle\n2                            SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    because it is undisputed that he agreed to accompany the officers to\n    the station and was free to leave at any time. Pp. 3\u22126.\n       (b) Petitioner seeks a third exception to the express invocation re-\n    quirement for cases where the witness chooses to stand mute rather\n    than give an answer that officials suspect would be incriminating,\n    but this Court\u2019s cases all but foreclose that argument. A defendant\n    normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent. See Rob-\n    erts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560. And the express invocation\n    requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that\n    the answer to his question would incriminate the witness. See Mur-\n    phy, supra, at 427\u2212428. For the same reasons that neither a witness\u2019\n    silence nor official suspicion is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness\n    of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, they do not do so\n    together. The proposed exception also would be difficult to reconcile\n    with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370, where this Court held in\n    the closely related context of post-Miranda silence that a defendant\n    failed to invoke his right to cut off police questioning when he re-\n    mained silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Id., at ___.\n       Petitioner claims that reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is\n    the most likely explanation for silence in a case like his, but such si-\n    lence is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, 617.\n    To be sure, petitioner might have declined to answer the officer\u2019s\n    question in reliance on his constitutional privilege. But he also might\n    have done so because he was trying to think of a good lie, because he\n    was embarrassed, or because he was protecting someone else. Not\n    every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but\n    neither is every possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amend-\n    ment. Petitioner also suggests that it would be unfair to require a\n    suspect unschooled in the particulars of legal doctrine to do anything\n    more than remain silent in order to invoke his \u201cright to remain si-\n    lent.\u201d But the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no one may be\n    \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u201d not\n    an unqualified \u201cright to remain silent.\u201d In any event, it is settled\n    that forfeiture of the privilege against self-incrimination need not be\n    knowing. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427\u2013428. Pp. 6\u221210.\n       (c) Petitioner\u2019s argument that applying the express invocation re-\n    quirement in this context will be unworkable is also unpersuasive.\n    The Court has long required defendants to assert the privilege in or-\n    der to subsequently benefit from it, and this rule has not proved diffi-\n    cult to apply in practice. Pp. 10\u221212.\n       JUSTICE THOMAS, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded that peti-\n    tioner\u2019s claim would fail even if he invoked the privilege because the\n    prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his precustodial silence did not\n    compel him to give self-incriminating testimony.

TEXAS\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CRIMINAL\n\n                   APPEALS OF TEXAS\n\n                                 [June 17, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY join.\n   Without being placed in custody or receiving Miranda\nwarnings, petitioner voluntarily answered the questions\nof a police officer who was investigating a murder. But\npetitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballis-\ntics test would show that the shell casings found at the\ncrime scene would match petitioner\u2019s shotgun. Petitioner\nwas subsequently charged with murder, and at trial pros-\necutors argued that his reaction to the officer\u2019s question\nsuggested that he was guilty. Petitioner claims that this\nargument violated the Fifth Amendment, which guaran-\ntees that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any crimi-\nnal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d\n   Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim fails because he\ndid not expressly invoke the privilege against self-\nincrimination in response to the officer\u2019s question. It has\nlong been settled that the privilege \u201cgenerally is not self-\nexecuting\u201d and that a witness who desires its protection\n\u201c \u2018must claim it.\u2019 \u201d Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420,\n425, 427 (1984) (quoting United States v. Monia, 317 U. S.\n2                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n424, 427 (1943)). Although \u201cno ritualistic formula is nec-\nessary in order to invoke the privilege,\u201d Quinn v. United\nStates, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955), a witness does not do so\nby simply standing mute. Because petitioner was required\nto assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the\njudgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting\npetitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.\n                                I\n  On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers\nwere shot and killed in their Houston home. There were\nno witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard\ngunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed\naway in a dark-colored car. Police recovered six shotgun\nshell casings at the scene. The investigation led police to\npetitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims\nhosted the night before they were killed. Police visited\npetitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in\nthe driveway. He agreed to hand over his shotgun for\nballistics testing and to accompany police to the station\nfor questioning.\n  Petitioner\u2019s interview with the police lasted approxi-\nmately one hour. All agree that the interview was noncusto-\ndial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption\nthat he was not read Miranda warnings. See Mi-\nranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). For most of the\ninterview, petitioner answered the officer\u2019s questions. But\nwhen asked whether his shotgun \u201cwould match the shells\nrecovered at the scene of the murder,\u201d App. 17, petitioner\ndeclined to answer. Instead, petitioner \u201c[l]ooked down at\nthe floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his\nhands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.\u201d Id., at 18.\nAfter a few moments of silence, the officer asked addition-\nal questions, which petitioner answered. Ibid.\n  Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on\noutstanding traffic warrants. Prosecutors soon concluded\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to charge him with\nthe murders, and he was released. A few days later, police\nobtained a statement from a man who said he had heard\npetitioner confess to the killings. On the strength of\nthat additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti-\ntioner, but by this time he had absconded. In 2007, police\ndiscovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an\nassumed name.\n   Petitioner did not testify at trial. Over his objection,\nprosecutors used his reaction to the officer\u2019s question dur-\ning the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt. The jury\nfound petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sen-\ntence. On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of\nTexas, petitioner argued that prosecutors\u2019 use of his si-\nlence as part of their case in chief violated the Fifth\nAmendment. The Court of Appeals rejected that argu-\nment, reasoning that petitioner\u2019s prearrest, pre-Miranda\nsilence was not \u201ccompelled\u201d within the meaning of the\nFifth Amendment. 368 S. W. 3d 550, 557\u2013559 (2011). The\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and\naffirmed on the same ground. 369 S. W. 3d 176 (2012).\n   We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), to resolve\na division of authority in the lower courts over whether\nthe prosecution may use a defendant\u2019s assertion of the\nprivilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial\npolice interview as part of its case in chief. Compare, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rivera, 944 F. 2d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991),\nwith United States v. Moore, 104 F. 3d 377, 386 (CADC\n1997). But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege\nduring his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that\nquestion.\n                             II\n                              A\n  The privilege against self-incrimination \u201cis an exception\nto the general principle that the Government has the right\n4                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nto everyone\u2019s testimony.\u201d Garner v. United States, 424\nU. S. 648, 658, n. 11 (1976). To prevent the privilege from\nshielding information not properly within its scope, we\nhave long held that a witness who \u201c \u2018desires the protection\nof the privilege . . . must claim it\u2019 \u201d at the time he relies on\nit. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U. S., at\n427). See also United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commis-\nsioner of Immigration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927).\n   That requirement ensures that the Government is put\non notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege\nso that it may either argue that the testimony sought\ncould not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United\nStates, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or cure any potential\nself-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kasti-\ngar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441, 448 (1972). The ex-\npress invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with\nevaluating a Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous\nrecord establishing the witness\u2019 reasons for refusing to\nanswer. See Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 560,\nn. 7 (1980) (\u201cA witness may not employ the privilege to\navoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not\nto give\u201d); Hutcheson v. United States, 369 U. S. 599, 610\u2013\n611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as\nproper assertion of the privilege). In these ways, insisting\nthat witnesses expressly invoke the privilege \u201cassures that\nthe Government obtains all the information to which it is\nentitled.\u201d Garner, supra, at 658, n. 11.\n   We have previously recognized two exceptions to the\nrequirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but\nneither applies here. First, we held in Griffin v. Califor-\nnia, 380 U. S. 609, 613\u2013615 (1965), that a criminal de-\nfendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at\nhis own trial. That exception reflects the fact that a crim-\ninal defendant has an \u201cabsolute right not to testify.\u201d\nTurner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398, 433 (1970) (Black,\nJ., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                       Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n637 (2004) (plurality opinion). Since a defendant\u2019s reasons\nfor remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitu-\ntional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke\nthe privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing\nthat his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a\ngrant of immunity could force him to speak. Because pe-\ntitioner had no comparable unqualified right during his\ninterview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin\nexception.\n   Second, we have held that a witness\u2019 failure to invoke\nthe privilege must be excused where governmental coer-\ncion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.\nThus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected\nto the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of an unwarned\ncustodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege. 384\nU. S., at 467\u2013468, and n. 37. Due to the uniquely coercive\nnature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody\ncannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege\n\u201cunless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.\u201d\nMurphy, supra, at 429\u2013430.\n   For similar reasons, we have held that threats to with-\ndraw a governmental benefit such as public employment\nsometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it\nneed not be affirmatively asserted. Garrity v. New Jersey,\n385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967) (public employment). See also\nLefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802\u2013804 (1977)\n(public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 84\u201385\n(1973) (public contracts). And where assertion of the\nprivilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed\nwitnesses to exercise the privilege through silence. See,\ne.g., Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28\u201329 (1969) (no\nrequirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing\nso would have revealed income from illegal activities);\nAlbertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., 382 U. S.\n70, 77\u201379 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not\nrequired to complete registration form \u201cwhere response to\n6                    SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nany of the form\u2019s questions . . . might involve [them] in the\nadmission of a crucial element of a crime\u201d). The principle\nthat unites all of those cases is that a witness need not\nexpressly invoke the privilege where some form of official\ncompulsion denies him \u201ca \u2018free choice to admit, to deny,\nor to refuse to answer.\u2019 \u201d Garner, 424 U. S., at 656\u2013657\n(quoting Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941)).\n   Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it\nis undisputed that his interview with police was volun-\ntary. As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to\naccompany the officers to the station and \u201cwas free to\nleave at any time during the interview.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 2\u20133 (internal quotation marks omitted). That places\npetitioner\u2019s situation outside the scope of Miranda and\nother cases in which we have held that various forms of\ngovernmental coercion prevented defendants from volun-\ntarily invoking the privilege. The dissent elides this point\nwhen it cites our precedents in this area for the proposi-\ntion that \u201c[c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation,\ntrigger the protection of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Post,\nat 7\u20138 (opinion of BREYER, J.). The critical question is\nwhether, under the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of this case, petitioner\nwas deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the Fifth\nAmendment. He was not. We have before us no allegation\nthat petitioner\u2019s failure to assert the privilege was invol-\nuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to\nsay that he was not answering the officer\u2019s question on\nFifth Amendment grounds. Because he failed to do so, the\nprosecution\u2019s use of his noncustodial silence did not violate\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n                             B\n   Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in-\nvocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands\nmute and thereby declines to give an answer that of-\nficials suspect would be incriminating. Our cases all but\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nforeclose such an exception, which would needlessly bur-\nden the Government\u2019s interests in obtaining testimony\nand prosecuting criminal activity. We therefore decline\npetitioner\u2019s invitation to craft a new exception to the\n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d that a witness must assert the privilege to\nsubsequently benefit from it. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 429.\n   Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not\ninvoke the privilege by remaining silent. In Roberts v.\nUnited States, 445 U. S. 552, for example, we rejected the\nFifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained\nsilent throughout a police investigation and received a\nharsher sentence for his failure to cooperate. In so ruling,\nwe explained that \u201cif [the defendant] believed that his\nfailure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so\nat a time when the sentencing court could have deter-\nmined whether his claim was legitimate.\u201d Id., at 560. See\nalso United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 263\u2013264\n(1927); Vajtauer, 273 U. S., at 113.1 A witness does not\nexpressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.\n   We have also repeatedly held that the express invoca-\ntion requirement applies even when an official has reason\nto suspect that the answer to his question would incrim-\ninate the witness. Thus, in Murphy we held that the\ndefendant\u2019s self-incriminating answers to his probation of-\nficer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to\ninvoke the privilege. 465 U. S., at 427\u2013428. In reaching\nthat conclusion, we rejected the notion \u201cthat a witness\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The dissent argues that in these cases \u201cneither the nature of the\n\nquestions nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided\nany basis to infer a tie between the silence and the Fifth Amendment.\u201d\nPost, at 5\u20136 (opinion of BREYER, J.). But none of our precedents sug-\ngests that governmental officials are obliged to guess at the meaning of\na witness\u2019 unexplained silence when implicit reliance on the Fifth\nAmendment seems probable. Roberts does not say as much, despite its\nholding that the defendant in that case was required to explain the\nFifth Amendment basis for his failure to cooperate with an investiga-\ntion that led to his prosecution. 445 U. S., at 559.\n8                         SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nmust \u2018put the Government on notice by formally availing\nhimself of the privilege\u2019 only when he alone \u2018is reasonably\naware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 428 (quoting Roberts, supra, at 562, n.* (Brennan,\nJ., concurring)). See also United States v. Kordel, 397\nU. S. 1, 7 (1970).2\n   Petitioner does not dispute the vitality of either of those\nlines of precedent but instead argues that we should adopt\nan exception for cases at their intersection. Thus, peti-\ntioner would have us hold that although neither a wit-\nness\u2019 silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse\nthe express invocation requirement, the invocation require-\nment does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of\nofficial suspicions. For the same reasons that neither\nof those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of\nthe obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we con-\nclude that they do not do so together. A contrary result\nwould do little to protect those genuinely relying on the\nFifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new\nburden on society\u2019s interest in the admission of evidence\nthat is probative of a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt.\n   Petitioner\u2019s proposed exception would also be very diffi-\ncult to reconcile with Berghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S.\n370 (2010). There, we held in the closely related context of\npost-Miranda silence that a defendant failed to invoke the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 Our cases do not support the distinction the dissent draws between\n\nsilence and the failure to invoke the privilege before making incriminat-\ning statements. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissenting). For example,\nMurphy, a case in which the witness made incriminating statements\nafter failing to invoke the privilege, repeatedly relied on Roberts\nand Vajtauer\u2014two cases in which witnesses remained silent and did\nnot make incriminating statements. 465 U. S., at 427, 429, 455\u2013456,\nn. 20. Similarly, Kordel cited Vajtauer, among other cases, for the\nproposition that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure at any time to assert the\nconstitutional privilege leaves him in no position to complain now that\nhe was compelled to give testimony against himself.\u201d 397 U. S., at 10,\nand n. 18.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at\n3, 8\u201310). If the extended custodial silence in that case did\nnot invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary si-\nlence in this case did not do so either.\n   Petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish Berg-\nhuis by observing that it did not concern the admissi-\nbility of the defendant\u2019s silence but instead involved the\nadmissibility of his subsequent statements. Post, at 8\u20139\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). But regardless of whether prose-\ncutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows, the\nlogic of Berghuis applies with equal force: A suspect who\nstands mute has not done enough to put police on notice\nthat he is relying on his Fifth Amendment privilege.3\n   In support of their proposed exception to the invocation\nrequirement, petitioner and the dissent argue that reli-\nance on the Fifth Amendment privilege is the most likely\nexplanation for silence in a case such as this one. Reply\nBrief 17; see post, at 9\u201310 (BREYER, J., dissenting). But\nwhatever the most probable explanation, such silence is\n\u201cinsolubly ambiguous.\u201d See Doyle, v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610,\n617 (1976). To be sure, someone might decline to answer a\npolice officer\u2019s question in reliance on his constitutional\nprivilege. But he also might do so because he is trying to\nthink of a good lie, because he is embarrassed, or because\nhe is protecting someone else. Not every such possible\nexplanation for silence is probative of guilt, but neither is\nevery possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amend-\nment. Petitioner alone knew why he did not answer the\nofficer\u2019s question, and it was therefore his \u201cburden . . . to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioner is correct that due process prohibits prosecutors from\n\npointing to the fact that a defendant was silent after he heard Miranda\nwarnings, Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S. 610, 617\u2013618 (1976), but that rule\ndoes not apply where a suspect has not received the warnings\u2019 implicit\npromise that any silence will not be used against him, Jenkins v.\nAnderson, 447 U. S. 231, 240 (1980).\n10                        SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                          Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nmake a timely assertion of the privilege.\u201d Garner, 424\nU. S., at 655.\n   At oral argument, counsel for petitioner suggested that\nit would be unfair to require a suspect unschooled in the\nparticulars of legal doctrine to do anything more than\nremain silent in order to invoke his \u201cright to remain si-\nlent.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 26\u201327; see post, at 10 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting); Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 439 (1974)\n(observing that \u201cvirtually every schoolboy is familiar with\nthe concept, if not the language\u201d of the Fifth Amendment).\nBut popular misconceptions notwithstanding, the Fifth\nAmendment guarantees that no one may be \u201ccompelled in\nany criminal case to be a witness against himself \u201d; it does\nnot establish an unqualified \u201cright to remain silent.\u201d A\nwitness\u2019 constitutional right to refuse to answer questions\ndepends on his reasons for doing so, and courts need to\nknow those reasons to evaluate the merits of a Fifth\nAmendment claim. See Hoffman, 341 U. S., at 486\u2013487.4\n   In any event, it is settled that forfeiture of the privilege\nagainst self-incrimination need not be knowing. Murphy,\n465 U.

But we have\nnever said that the government must demonstrate such a need on a\ncase-by-case basis for the invocation requirement to apply. Any such\nrule would require judicial hypothesizing about the probable strategic\nchoices of prosecutors, who often use immunity to compel testimony\nfrom witnesses who invoke the Fifth Amendment.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

At pre-\ncisely what point such reactions transform \u201csilence\u201d into\nexpressive conduct would be a difficult and recurring\nquestion that our decision allows us to avoid.\n   We also reject petitioner\u2019s argument that an express\ninvocation requirement will encourage police officers to\n\u201c \u2018unfairly \u201ctric[k]\u201d \u2019 \u201d suspects into cooperating.

The plurality\navoids reaching that question and instead concludes that\nSalinas\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim fails because he did not\nexpressly invoke the privilege. Ante, at 3. I think there is\na simpler way to resolve this case. In my view, Salinas\u2019\nclaim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege be-\ncause the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his precusto-\ndial silence did not compel him to give self-incriminating\ntestimony.\n   In Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), this Court\nheld that the Fifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor or\njudge from commenting on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\nId., at 614. The Court reasoned that such comments, and\nany adverse inferences drawn from them, are a \u201cpenalty\u201d\nimposed on the defendant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amend-\nment privilege. Ibid. Salinas argues that we should\nextend Griffin\u2019s no-adverse-inference rule to a defendant\u2019s\nsilence during a precustodial interview. I have previously\nexplained that the Court\u2019s decision in Griffin \u201clacks foun-\ndation in the Constitution\u2019s text, history, or logic\u201d and\nshould not be extended. See Mitchell v. United States, 526\n2                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nU. S. 314, 341 (1999) (dissenting opinion). I adhere to that\nview today.\n   Griffin is impossible to square with the text of the Fifth\nAmendment, which provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . shall be\ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\nhimself.\u201d A defendant is not \u201ccompelled . . . to be a witness\nagainst himself \u201d simply because a jury has been told that\nit may draw an adverse inference from his silence. See\nMitchell, supra, at 331 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\u201c[T]he\nthreat of an adverse inference does not \u2018compel\u2019 anyone to\ntestify. . . . Indeed, I imagine that in most instances, a\nguilty defendant would choose to remain silent despite\nthe adverse inference, on the theory that it would do\nhim less damage than his cross-examined testimony\u201d);\nCarter v. Kentucky, 450 U. S. 288, 306 (1981) (Powell,\nJ., concurring) (\u201c[N]othing in the [Self-Incrimination]\nClause requires that jurors not draw logical inferences\nwhen a defendant chooses not to explain incriminating\ncircumstances\u201d).\n   Nor does the history of the Fifth Amendment support\nGriffin. At the time of the founding, English and Ameri-\ncan courts strongly encouraged defendants to give un-\nsworn statements and drew adverse inferences when they\nfailed to do so. See Mitchell, supra, at 332 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting); Alschuler, A Peculiar Privilege in Historical\nPerspective, in The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination\n204 (R. Hemholz et al. eds. 1997). Given Griffin\u2019s indefen-\nsible foundation, I would not extend it to a defendant\u2019s\nsilence during a precustodial interview. I agree with the\nplurality that Salinas\u2019 Fifth Amendment claim fails and,\ntherefore, concur in the judgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And I dissent from the\nCourt\u2019s contrary conclusion.\n                               I\n   In January 1993, Houston police began to suspect peti-\ntioner Genovevo Salinas of having committed two murders\nthe previous month. They asked Salinas to come to the\npolice station \u201cto take photographs and to clear him as [a]\nsuspect.\u201d App. 3. At the station, police took Salinas into\nwhat he describes as \u201can interview room.\u201d Brief for Peti-\ntioner 3. Because he was \u201cfree to leave at that time,\u201d App.\n14, they did not give him Miranda warnings. The police\nthen asked Salinas questions. And Salinas answered until\nthe police asked him whether the shotgun from his home\n\u201cwould match the shells recovered at the scene of the\nmurder.\u201d Id., at 17. At that point Salinas fell silent. Ibid.\n   Salinas was later tried for, and convicted of, murder. At\nclosing argument, drawing on testimony he had elicited\nearlier, the prosecutor pointed out to the jury that Salinas,\nduring his earlier questioning at the police station, had\nremained silent when asked about the shotgun. The\nprosecutor told the jury, among other things, that \u201c \u2018[a]n\n2                    SALINAS v.

Rather, \u201c \u2018[h]e\nwouldn\u2019t answer that question.\u2019 \u201d Ibid.\n                              II\n  The question before us is whether the Fifth Amendment\nprohibits the prosecutor from eliciting and commenting\nupon the evidence about Salinas\u2019 silence. The plurality\nbelieves that the Amendment does not bar the evidence\nand comments because Salinas \u201cdid not expressly invoke\nthe privilege against self-incrimination\u201d when he fell silent\nduring the questioning at the police station. Ante, at 1.\nBut, in my view, that conclusion is inconsistent with this\nCourt\u2019s case law and its underlying practical rationale.\n                             A\n  The Fifth Amendment prohibits prosecutors from com-\nmenting on an individual\u2019s silence where that silence\namounts to an effort to avoid becoming \u201ca witness against\nhimself.\u201d This Court has specified that \u201ca rule of evidence\u201d\npermitting \u201ccommen[t] . . . by counsel\u201d in a criminal case\nupon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify \u201cviolates the Fifth\nAmendment.\u201d Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 610,\nn. 2, 613 (1965) (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso United States v. Patane, 542 U. S. 630, 637 (2004)\n(plurality opinion); Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398,\n433 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting). And, since \u201cit is imper-\nmissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth\nAmendment privilege when he is under police custodial\ninterrogation,\u201d the \u201cprosecution may not . . . use at trial\nthe fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the\nface of accusation.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,\n468, n. 37 (1966) (emphasis added).\n  Particularly in the context of police interrogation, a\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncontrary rule would undermine the basic protection that\nthe Fifth Amendment provides. Cf. Kastigar v. United\nStates, 406 U. S. 441, 461 (1972) (\u201cThe privilege . . . usu-\nally operates to allow a citizen to remain silent when asked\na question requiring an incriminatory answer\u201d). To permit\na prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s constitutionally\nprotected silence would put that defendant in an impossi-\nble predicament. He must either answer the question or\nremain silent. If he answers the question, he may well\nreveal, for example, prejudicial facts, disreputable associ-\nates, or suspicious circumstances\u2014even if he is innocent.\nSee, e.g., Griffin, supra, at 613; Kassin, Inside Interroga-\ntion: Why Innocent People Confess, 32 Am. J. Trial Advoc.\n525, 537 (2009). If he remains silent, the prosecutor may\nwell use that silence to suggest a consciousness of guilt.\nAnd if the defendant then takes the witness stand in order\nto explain either his speech or his silence, the prosecution\nmay introduce, say for impeachment purposes, a prior\nconviction that the law would otherwise make inadmissi-\nble. Thus, where the Fifth Amendment is at issue, to\nallow comment on silence directly or indirectly can compel\nan individual to act as \u201ca witness against himself \u201d\u2014very\nmuch what the Fifth Amendment forbids. Cf. Pennsylva-\nnia v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 596\u2013597 (1990) (definition of\n\u201ctestimonial\u201d includes responses to questions that require\na suspect to communicate an express or implied assertion\nof fact or belief). And that is similarly so whether the\nquestioned individual, as part of his decision to remain\nsilent, invokes the Fifth Amendment explicitly or implic-\nitly, through words, through deeds, or through reference to\nsurrounding circumstances.\n                            B\n  It is consequently not surprising that this Court, more\nthan half a century ago, explained that \u201cno ritualistic\nformula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d\n4                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nQuinn v. United States, 349 U. S. 155, 164 (1955). Thus,\na prosecutor may not comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to\ntestify at trial\u2014even if neither the defendant nor anyone\nelse ever mentions a Fifth Amendment right not to do so.\nCircumstances, not a defendant\u2019s statement, tie the de-\nfendant\u2019s silence to the right. Similarly, a prosecutor may\nnot comment on the fact that a defendant in custody, after\nreceiving Miranda warnings, \u201cstood mute\u201d\u2014regardless of\nwhether he \u201cclaimed his privilege\u201d in so many words.\nMiranda, supra, at 468, n. 37. Again, it is not any explicit\nstatement but, instead, the defendant\u2019s deeds (silence) and\ncircumstances (receipt of the warnings) that tie together\nsilence and constitutional right. Most lower courts have so\nconstrued the law, even where the defendant, having\nreceived Miranda warnings, answers some questions\nwhile remaining silent as to others. See, e.g., Hurd v.\nTerhune, 619 F. 3d 1080, 1087 (CA9 2010); United States\nv. May, 52 F. 3d 885, 890 (CA10 1995); United States v.\nScott, 47 F. 3d 904, 907 (CA7 1995); United States v. Can-\nterbury, 985 F. 2d 483, 486 (CA10 1993); Grieco v. Hall,\n641 F. 2d 1029, 1034 (CA1 1981); United States v. Ghiz,\n491 F. 2d 599, 600 (CA4 1974). But see, e.g., United States\nv. Harris, 956 F. 2d 177, 181 (CA8 1992).\n   The cases in which this Court has insisted that a de-\nfendant expressly mention the Fifth Amendment by name\nin order to rely on its privilege to protect silence are cases\nwhere (1) the circumstances surrounding the silence (un-\nlike the present case) did not give rise to an inference that\nthe defendant intended, by his silence, to exercise his Fifth\nAmendment rights; and (2) the questioner greeted by the\nsilence (again unlike the present case) had a special need\nto know whether the defendant sought to rely on the\nprotections of the Fifth Amendment. See ante, at 4 (ex-\nplaining that, in such cases, the government needs to\nknow the basis for refusing to answer \u201cso that it may\neither argue that the testimony sought could not be self-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

These\ncases include Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, Vajtauer, and\nJenkins\u2014all of which at least do involve the protection of\nsilence\u2014and also include cases emphasized by the plural-\nity that are not even about silence\u2014namely, Murphy and\nGarner.\n   In Roberts and Rogers, the individual refused to answer\nquestions that government investigators (in Roberts) and a\ngrand jury (in Rogers) asked, principally because the\nindividual wanted to avoid incriminating other persons.\nRoberts v. United States, 445 U. S. 552, 553\u2013556 (1980);\nRogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 368\u2013370, and n. 4\n(1951). But the Fifth Amendment does not protect some-\none from incriminating others; it protects against self-\nincrimination. In turn, neither the nature of the questions\nnor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them pro-\nvided any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the\nFifth Amendment, while knowledge of any such tie would\nhave proved critical to the questioner\u2019s determination as to\nwhether the defendant had any proper legal basis for\nclaiming Fifth Amendment protection.\n   In Sullivan, the defendant\u2019s silence consisted of his\nfailure to file a tax return\u2014a return, he later claimed, that\nwould have revealed his illegal activity as a bootlegger.\nUnited States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, 262\u2013264 (1927).\nThe circumstances did not give rise to an inference of a tie\nbetween his silence (in the form of failing to file a tax\nreturn) and the Fifth Amendment; and, if he really did\nwant to rely on the Fifth Amendment, then the govern-\nment would have had special need to know of any such tie\nin order to determine whether, for example, the assertion\nof privilege was valid and, perhaps, an offer of immunity\nwas appropriate.\n   In Vajtauer, an alien refused to answer questions asked\nby an immigration official at a deportation proceeding.\n6                    SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immi-\ngration, 273 U. S. 103, 113 (1927). Here, the circumstances\ngave rise to a distinct inference that the alien was not\ninvoking any Fifth Amendment privilege: The alien\u2019s\nlawyer had stated quite publicly at the hearing that he\nadvised his client to remain silent not on Fifth Amend-\nment grounds; rather, the lawyer \u201c \u2018advise[d] the alien not\nto answer any further questions until the evidence upon\nwhich the warrant is based will be presented here.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 106\u2013107 (quoting the lawyer). This statement weak-\nened or destroyed the possibility of a silence-Fifth\nAmendment linkage; the Government could not challenge\nhis right to invoke the Fifth Amendment; and this Court\ndescribed its later invocation as \u201cevidently an after-\nthought.\u201d Id., at 113.\n  Perhaps most illustrative is Jenkins, a case upon which\nthe plurality relies, ante, at 9, n. 3, and upon which the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals relied almost exclusively,\n369 S. W. 3d 176, 178\u2013179 (2012). Jenkins killed some-\none, and was not arrested until he turned himself in two\nweeks later. Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 232\n(1980). On cross-examination at his trial, Jenkins claimed\nthat his killing was in self-defense after being attacked.\nId., at 232\u2013233. The prosecutor then asked why he did not\nreport the alleged attack, and in closing argument sug-\ngested that Jenkins\u2019 failure to do so cast doubt on his\nclaim to have acted in self-defense. Id., at 233\u2013234. We\nexplained that this unusual form of \u201cprearrest silence\u201d\nwas not constitutionally protected from use at trial. Id., at\n240. Perhaps even more aptly, Justice Stevens\u2019 concur-\nrence noted that \u201cthe privilege against compulsory self-\nincrimination is simply irrelevant\u201d in such circumstances.\u201d\nId., at 241 (footnote omitted). How would anyone have\nknown that Jenkins, while failing to report an attack, was\nrelying on the Fifth Amendment? And how would the\ngovernment have had any way of determining whether his\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nclaim was valid? In Jenkins, as in Roberts, Rogers, Sulli-\nvan, and Vajtauer, no one had any reason to connect si-\nlence to the Fifth Amendment; and the government had no\nopportunity to contest any alleged connection.\n   Still further afield from today\u2019s case are Murphy and\nGarner, neither of which involved silence at all. Rather, in\nboth cases, a defendant had earlier answered questions\nposed by the government\u2014in Murphy, by speaking with a\nprobation officer, and in Garner, by completing a tax\nreturn. Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 422\u2013425\n(1984); Garner v. United States, 424 U. S. 648, 649\u2013650\n(1976). At the time of providing answers, neither circum-\nstances nor deeds nor words suggested reliance on the\nFifth Amendment: Murphy simply answered questions\nposed by his probation officer; Garner simply filled out a\ntax return.      They did not argue that their self-\nincriminating statements had been \u201ccompelled\u201d in viola-\ntion of the Fifth Amendment until later, at trial. Murphy,\nsupra, at 425, 431; Garner, supra, at 649, 665. The Court\nheld that those statements were not compelled. Murphy,\nsupra, at 440; Garner, supra, at 665. The circumstances\nindicated that the defendants had affirmatively chosen to\nspeak and to write.\n   Thus, we have two sets of cases: One where express\ninvocation of the Fifth Amendment was not required to tie\none\u2019s silence to its protections, and another where some-\nthing like express invocation was required, because cir-\ncumstances demanded some explanation for the silence\n(or the statements) in order to indicate that the Fifth\nAmendment was at issue.\n   There is also a third set of cases, cases that may well fit\ninto the second category but where the Court has held that\nthe Fifth Amendment both applies and does not require\nexpress invocation despite ambiguous circumstances. The\nCourt in those cases has made clear that an individual,\nwhen silent, need not expressly invoke the Fifth Amend-\n8                     SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nment if there are \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d not to\ndo so. Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467. Thus, in Garrity v.\nNew Jersey, 385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967), the Court held that\nno explicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment was required\nwhere, in the course of an investigation, such assertion\nwould, by law, have cost police officers their jobs. Similarly,\nthis Court did not require explicit assertion in response\nto a grand jury subpoena where that assertion would have\ncost two architects their public contracts or a political\nofficial his job. Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 75\u201376\n(1973); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, 802\u2013804\n(1977). In Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6, 28\u201329\n(1969), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment did not\nrequire explicit assertion of the privilege against self-\nincrimination because, in the context of the Marihuana\nTax Act, such assertion would have been inherently in-\ncriminating. In Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control\nBd., 382 U. S. 70, 77\u201379 (1965), we held the same where\nexplicit assertion of the Fifth Amendment would have\nrequired, as a first step, the potentially incriminating\nadmission of membership in the Communist Party. The\nCourt has also held that gamblers, without explicitly\ninvoking the Fifth Amendment, need not comply with tax\nrequirements that would, inherently and directly, lead to\nself-incrimination. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S.\n39, 60\u201361 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U. S. 62,\n67\u201368 (1968). All told, this third category of cases receives\nthe same treatment as the first: Circumstances, rather\nthan explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the Fifth\nAmendment. So, too, in today\u2019s case.\n  The plurality refers to one additional case, namely\nBerghuis v. Thompkins, 560 U. S. 370 (2010). See ante, at\n8. But that case is here beside the point. In Berghuis, the\ndefendant was in custody, he had been informed of his\nMiranda rights, and he was subsequently silent in the\nface of 2 hours and 45 minutes of questioning before he\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The Court held that he had waived his Fifth\nAmendment rights in respect to his later speech. The\nCourt said nothing at all about a prosecutor\u2019s right to\ncomment on his preceding silence and no prosecutor\nsought to do so. Indeed, how could a prosecutor lawfully\nhave tried to do so, given this Court\u2019s statement in Mi-\nranda itself that a prosecutor cannot comment on the fact\nthat, after receiving Miranda warnings, the suspect \u201cstood\nmute\u201d? 384 U. S., at 468, n. 37.\n  We end where we began. \u201c[N]o ritualistic formula is\nnecessary in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d Quinn, 349\nU. S., at 164. Much depends on the circumstances of the\nparticular case, the most important circumstances being:\n(1) whether one can fairly infer that the individual being\nquestioned is invoking the Amendment\u2019s protection; (2) if\nthat is unclear, whether it is particularly important for\nthe questioner to know whether the individual is doing so;\nand (3) even if it is, whether, in any event, there is a good\nreason for excusing the individual from referring to the\nFifth Amendment, such as inherent penalization simply\nby answering.\n                             C\n  Applying these principles to the present case, I would\nhold that Salinas need not have expressly invoked the\nFifth Amendment. The context was that of a criminal\ninvestigation. Police told Salinas that and made clear that\nhe was a suspect. His interrogation took place at the\npolice station. Salinas was not represented by counsel.\nThe relevant question\u2014about whether the shotgun from\nSalinas\u2019 home would incriminate him\u2014amounted to a\nswitch in subject matter. And it was obvious that the new\nquestion sought to ferret out whether Salinas was guilty of\nmurder. See 368 S. W. 3d, at 552\u2013553.\n  These circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference\n10                   SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat Salinas\u2019 silence derived from an exercise of his Fifth\nAmendment rights. This Court has recognized repeatedly\nthat many, indeed most, Americans are aware that they\nhave a constitutional right not to incriminate themselves\nby answering questions posed by the police during an\ninterrogation conducted in order to figure out the perpe-\ntrator of a crime. See Dickerson v. United States, 530\nU. S. 428, 443 (2000); Brogan v. United States, 522 U. S.\n398, 405 (1998); Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 439\n(1974). The nature of the surroundings, the switch of\ntopic, the particular question\u2014all suggested that the right\nwe have and generally know we have was at issue at the\ncritical moment here. Salinas, not being represented by\ncounsel, would not likely have used the precise words\n\u201cFifth Amendment\u201d to invoke his rights because he would\nnot likely have been aware of technical legal require-\nments, such as a need to identify the Fifth Amendment by\nname.\n  At the same time, the need to categorize Salinas\u2019 silence\nas based on the Fifth Amendment is supported here by the\npresence, in full force, of the predicament I discussed\nearlier, namely that of not forcing Salinas to choose be-\ntween incrimination through speech and incrimination\nthrough silence. That need is also supported by the ab-\nsence of any special reason that the police had to know,\nwith certainty, whether Salinas was, in fact, relying on the\nFifth Amendment\u2014such as whether to doubt that there\nreally was a risk of self-incrimination, see Hoffman v.\nUnited States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951), or whether to\ngrant immunity, see Kastigar, 406 U. S., at 448. Given\nthese circumstances, Salinas\u2019 silence was \u201csufficient to put\nthe [government] on notice of an apparent claim of the\nprivilege.\u201d Quinn, supra, at 164. That being so, for rea-\nsons similar to those given in Griffin, the Fifth Amend-\nment bars the evidence of silence admitted against Salinas\nand mentioned by the prosecutor. See 380 U. S., at 614\u2013615.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              D\n\n   I recognize that other cases may arise where facts and\ncircumstances surrounding an individual\u2019s silence present\na closer question. The critical question\u2014whether those\ncircumstances give rise to a fair inference that the silence\nrests on the Fifth Amendment\u2014will not always prove easy\nto administer. But that consideration does not support the\nplurality\u2019s rule-based approach here, for the administra-\ntive problems accompanying the plurality\u2019s approach are\neven worse.\n   The plurality says that a suspect must \u201cexpressly invoke\nthe privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d Ante, at 1. But\ndoes it really mean that the suspect must use the exact\nwords \u201cFifth Amendment\u201d? How can an individual who is\nnot a lawyer know that these particular words are legally\nmagic? Nor does the Solicitor General help when he adds\nthat the suspect may \u201cmak[e] the claim \u2018in any language\nthat [the questioner] may reasonably be expected to un-\nderstand as an attempt to invoke the privilege.\u2019 \u201d Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 22 (quoting Quinn, supra,\nat 162\u2013163; alteration in original). What counts as \u201cmak-\ning the claim\u201d? Suppose the individual says, \u201cLet\u2019s discuss\nsomething else,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to answer that\u201d; or\nsuppose he just gets up and leaves the room. Cf. Davis v.\nMississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 727, n. 6 (1969) (affirming \u201cthe\nsettled principle that while the police have the right to\nrequest citizens to answer voluntarily questions concern-\ning unsolved crimes[,] they have no right to compel them\nto answer\u201d); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420, 439\n(1984) (noting that even someone detained in a Terry stop\n\u201cis not obliged to respond\u201d to police questions); Florida v.\nRoyer, 460 U. S. 491, 497\u2013498 (1983) (plurality opinion).\nHow is simple silence in the present context any different?\n   The basic problem for the plurality is that an effort to\nhave a simple, clear \u201cexplicit statement\u201d rule poses a\nserious obstacle to those who, like Salinas, seek to assert\n12                   SALINAS v. TEXAS\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntheir basic Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, for\nthey are likely unaware of any such linguistic detail. At\nthe same time, acknowledging that our case law does not\nrequire use of specific words, see ante, at 2, leaves the\nplurality without the administrative benefits it might\nhope to find in requiring that detail.\n   Far better, in my view, to pose the relevant question\ndirectly: Can one fairly infer from an individual\u2019s silence\nand surrounding circumstances an exercise of the Fifth\nAmendment\u2019s privilege? The need for simplicity, the\nconstitutional importance of applying the Fifth Amend-\nment to those who seek its protection, and this Court\u2019s\ncase law all suggest that this is the right question to ask\nhere. And the answer to that question in the circumstances\nof today\u2019s case is clearly: yes.\n   For these reasons, I believe that the Fifth Amendment\nprohibits a prosecutor from commenting on Salinas\u2019s\nsilence. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary\nconclusion.\n</pre>",
