Argued January 9, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nRespondent attorneys submitted several state Freedom of Information\n  Act (FOIA) requests to the South Carolina DMV, seeking names and\n  addresses of thousands of individuals in order to solicit clients for a\n  lawsuit they had pending against several South Carolina car dealer-\n  ships for violation of a state law that protects car purchasers from\n  dealership actions that are “arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconsciona-\n  ble.” Using the personal information provided by the DMV, respond-\n  ents sent over 34,000 car purchasers letters, which were headed\n  “ADVERTISING MATERIAL,” explained the lawsuit, and asked re-\n  cipients to return an enclosed reply card if they wanted to participate\n  in the case. Petitioners, South Carolina residents, sued respondents\n  for violating the federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994\n  (DPPA) by obtaining, disclosing, and using petitioners’ personal in-\n  formation from motor vehicle records for bulk solicitation without\n  their express consent. Respondents moved to dismiss, claiming that\n  the information was properly released under a DPPA exception per-\n  mitting disclosure of personal information “for use in connection with\n  any civil, criminal, administrative, or arbitral proceeding,” including\n  “investigation in anticipation of litigation.” 18 U. S. C. §2721(b)(4).\n  The District Court held that respondents’ letters were not solicita-\n  tions and that the use of information fell within (b)(4)’s litigation ex-\n  ception. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the letters\n  were solicitation, but that the solicitation was intertwined with con-\n  duct that satisfied the (b)(4) exception.\nHeld: An attorney’s solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose\n covered by the (b)(4) litigation exception. Pp. 6–29.\n    (a) State DMVs generally require someone seeking a driver’s li-\n cense or registering a vehicle to disclose detailed personal infor-\n2                          MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    mation such as name, address, telephone number, Social Security\n    number, and medical information. The DPPA—responding to a\n    threat from stalkers and criminals who could acquire state DMV in-\n    formation, and concerns over the States’ common practice of selling\n    such information to direct marketing and solicitation businesses—\n    bans disclosure, absent a driver’s consent, of “personal information,”\n    e.g., names, addresses, or telephone numbers, as well as “highly re-\n    stricted personal information,” e.g., photographs, social security\n    numbers, and medical or disability information, §2725(4), unless 1 of\n    14 exemptions applies. Subsection (b)(4) permits disclosure of both\n    personal information and highly restricted personal information,\n    while subsection (b)(12) permits disclosure only of personal infor-\n    mation. Pp. 6–8.\n        (b) Respondents’ solicitation of prospective clients is neither a use\n    “in connection with” litigation nor “investigation in anticipation of lit-\n    igation” under (b)(4). Pp. 8–15.\n           (1) The phrase “in connection with” provides little guidance with-\n    out a limiting principle consistent with the DPPA’s purpose and its\n    other provisions. See New York State Conference of Blue Cross &\n    Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 656. Such a\n    consistent interpretation is also required because (b)(4) is an excep-\n    tion to both the DPPA’s general ban on disclosure of “personal infor-\n    mation” and the ban on release of “highly restricted personal infor-\n    mation.” An exception to a general policy statement is “usually read\n    . . . narrowly in order to preserve the [provision’s] primary operation.”\n    Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U. S. 726, 739. Reading (b)(4) to permit\n    disclosure of personal information when there is any connection be-\n    tween protected information and a potential legal dispute would sub-\n    stantially undermine the DPPA’s purpose of protecting a right to pri-\n    vacy in motor vehicle records. Subsection (b)(4)’s “in connection with”\n    language must have a limit, and a logical and necessary conclusion is\n    that an attorney’s solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of\n    that limit. Pp. 9–11.\n           (2) An attorney’s solicitation of new clients is distinct from an at-\n    torney’s conduct on behalf of his client or the court. Solicitation “by a\n    lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction,”\n    Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 457, and state bars\n    treat solicitation as discrete professional conduct. Excluding solicita-\n    tion from the meaning of “in connection with” litigation draws sup-\n    port from (b)(4)’s examples of permissible litigation uses—“service of\n    process, investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execution\n    or enforcement of judgments and orders”—which all involve an attor-\n    ney’s conduct as an officer of the court, not a commercial actor. Simi-\n    larly, “investigation in anticipation of litigation” is best understood to\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nallow background research to determine if there is a supportable the-\nory for a complaint or a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing\na frivolous lawsuit, or to help locate witnesses for deposition or trial.\nPp. 11–14.\n      (3) This reading is also supported by the fact that (b)(4) allows\nuse of the most sensitive personal information. Permitting its use in\nsolicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it must not be\nassumed, without clear and explicit language, absent here, that Con-\ngress intended to exempt attorneys from DPPA liability in this re-\ngard. Pp. 14–15.\n   (c) Limiting (b)(4)’s reach also respects the statutory purpose and\ndesign evident in subsection (b)(12), which allows solicitation only of\npersons who have given express consent to have their names and ad-\ndresses disclosed for this purpose. Subsection (b)(12) implements an\nimportant objective of the DPPA—to restrict disclosure of personal\ninformation in motor vehicle records to businesses for the purpose of\ndirect marketing and solicitation. Other exceptions should not be\nconstrued to interfere with this objective unless the text commands\nit. Reading (b)(4)’s “in connection with” phrase to include solicitation\nwould permit an attorney to use personal information from the state\nDMV to send bulk solicitations to prospective clients without their\nexpress consent, thus creating significant tension between the\nDPPA’s litigation and solicitation exceptions. Pp. 15–19.\n   (d) Such a reading of (b)(4) could also affect the interpretation of\nthe (b)(6) exception, which allows an insurer and certain others to ob-\ntain DMV information for use “in connection with . . . underwriting,”\nand the (b)(10) exception, which permits disclosure and use of per-\nsonal information “in connection with” the operation of private toll\nroads. Pp. 19–20.\n   (e) Respondents contend that a line can be drawn between mere\ntrolling for clients and their solicitation, which was tied to a specific\nlegal dispute, but that is not a tenable distinction. The DPPA sup-\nports drawing the line at solicitation. Solicitation can aid an attorney\nin bringing a lawsuit or increasing its size, but the question is\nwhether or not lawyers can use personal information protected under\nthe DPPA for this purpose. The mere fact that respondents complied\nwith state bar rules governing solicitations also does not resolve\nwhether they were entitled to access personal information from the\nstate DMV database for that purpose. In determining whether ob-\ntaining, using, or disclosing personal information is for the prohibited\npurpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant’s\npurpose was to solicit, which might be evident from the communica-\ntion itself or from the defendant’s course of conduct. When that is the\npredominant purpose, (b)(4) does not entitle attorneys to DPPA-\n4                         MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    protected information even when solicitation is to aggregate a class\n    action. Attorneys also have other alternatives to aggregate a class,\n    including, e.g. soliciting plaintiffs through traditional and permitted\n    advertising. And they may obtain DPPA-protected information for a\n    proper investigative use.\n       Although the Fourth Circuit held that the letters here were solici-\n    tations, it found the communications nonetheless exempt under (b)(4)\n    because they were “inextricably intertwined” with permissible litiga-\n    tion purposes. If however, the use of DPPA-protected personal in-\n    formation has the predominant purpose of solicitation, it would not\n    be protected by (b)(4). A remand is necessary for the court to apply\n    the proper standard to determine the predominant purpose of re-\n    spondents’ letters. Pp. 20–26.\n       (f) There is no work for the rule of lenity to do here, because the\n    DPPA’s text and structure resolve any ambiguity in (b)(4)’s phrases\n    “in connection with” and “investigation in anticipation of litigation.”\n    Pp. 26–27.\n       (g) On remand, the courts below must determine whether respond-\n    ents’ letters, viewed objectively, had the predominant purpose of so-\n    licitation, and may address whether respondents’ conduct was per-\n    missible under (b)(1)’s governmental-function exception and any\n    other defenses that have been properly preserved.

See 18 U. S. C. §§2721–\n2725.\n   The DPPA regulates the disclosure of personal infor-\nmation contained in the records of state motor vehicle de-\npartments (DMVs). Disclosure of personal information\nis prohibited unless for a purpose permitted by an ex-\nception listed in 1 of 14 statutory subsections. See\n§§2721(b)(1)–(14). This case involves the interpretation of\none of those exceptions, subsection (b)(4). The exception in\n(b)(4) permits obtaining personal information from a state\nDMV for use “in connection with” judicial and administra-\ntive proceedings, including “investigation in anticipation\nof litigation.” §2721(b)(4). The question presented is\nwhether an attorney’s solicitation of clients for a lawsuit\nfalls within the scope of (b)(4).\n2                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents are trial lawyers licensed to practice in\nSouth Carolina. They obtained names and addresses of\nthousands of individuals from the South Carolina DMV in\norder to send letters to find plaintiffs for a lawsuit they\nhad filed against car dealers for violations of South Caro-\nlina law. Petitioners, South Carolina residents whose\ninformation was obtained and used without their consent,\nsued respondents for violating the DPPA. Respondents\nclaimed the solicitation letters were permitted under\nsubsection (b)(4). In light of the text, structure, and pur-\npose of the DPPA, the Court now holds that an attorney’s\nsolicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered\nby the (b)(4) litigation exception.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   The State of South Carolina, to protect purchasers of\nmotor vehicles, enacted the South Carolina Regulation\nof Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (MDDA).\nIn June 2006, respondent attorneys were approached by\ncar purchasers who complained about administrative fees\ncharged by car dealerships in certain South Carolina\ncounties, allegedly in violation of the MDDA. The state\nstatute prohibits motor vehicle dealers from engaging in\n“any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscion-\nable and which causes damage to any of the parties or to\nthe public.” S. C. Code Ann. §56–15–40(1) (2006). The\nMDDA provides that “one or more may sue for the benefit\nof the whole” where an action is “one of common or general\ninterest to many persons or when the parties are numer-\nous and it is impracticable to bring them all before the\ncourt.” §56–15–110(2).\n   On June 23, 2006, one of the respondent attorneys\nsubmitted a state Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nrequest to the South Carolina DMV to determine if charg-\ning illegal administrative fees was a common practice so\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a lawsuit could be brought as a representative action\nunder the MDDA. The attorney’s letter to the DMV re-\nquested information regarding “[p]rivate purchases of new\nor used automobiles in Spartanburg County during the\nweek of May 1–7, 2006, including the name, address, and\ntelephone number of the buyer, dealership where pur-\nchased, type of vehicle purchased, and date of purchase.”\nApp. 57. The letter explained that the request was made\n“in anticipation of litigation . . . pursuant to the exception\nin 18 USC §2721(b)(4) of the Driver’s Privacy Protection\nAct.” Ibid. The South Carolina DMV provided the re-\nquested information. On August 24, 2006, respondents\nsubmitted a second FOIA request to the DMV, also assert-\ning that it was made “in anticipation of litigation . . .\npursuant to the exception in 18 USC §2721(b)(4),” for car\npurchasers in five additional counties during the same\nweek. Id., at 67.\n  On August 29, 2006, respondents filed suit in South\nCarolina state court on behalf of four of the consumers\nwho originally contacted them. The case is referred to\nhere, and by the parties, as the Herron suit. The com-\nplaint in the Herron suit named 51 dealers as defendants\nand invoked the MDDA’s “group action” provision to assert\nclaims “for the benefit of all South Carolina car buyers\nwh[o] paid administrative fees,” id., at 128, to those deal-\ners during the same time period.\n  Some of the dealer defendants in the Herron suit filed\nmotions to dismiss for lack of standing because none of the\nnamed plaintiffs purchased cars from them. On October\n26, 2006, while the motions to dismiss were pending,\nrespondents submitted a new FOIA request to the South\nCarolina DMV. That request, again citing subsection\n(b)(4) of the DPPA, sought to locate additional car buyers\nwho could serve as plaintiffs against the dealers who had\nmoved to dismiss. On October 31, 2006, respondents filed\nan amended complaint, which added four named plaintiffs\n4                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand increased the number of defendant dealers from 51 to\n324. As before, defendant dealerships that had not en-\ngaged in transactions with any of the now eight named\nplaintiffs filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing.\n   On January 3, 2007, using the personal information\nthey had obtained from the South Carolina DMV, re-\nspondents sent a mass mailing to find car buyers to serve\nas additional plaintiffs in the litigation against the deal-\ners. Later in January, respondents made three more\nFOIA requests to the South Carolina DMV seeking per-\nsonal information concerning people who had purchased\ncars from an additional 31 dealerships, again citing the\n(b)(4) exception. The South Carolina DMV granted all the\nrequests. On January 23, respondents mailed a second\nround of letters to car buyers whose personal information\nhad been disclosed by the DMV. Respondents sent addi-\ntional rounds of letters on March 1, March 5, and May 8.\nEach of the five separate mailings was sent to different\nrecipients. In total, respondents used the information\nobtained through their FOIA requests to send letters to\nover 34,000 car purchasers in South Carolina. This opin-\nion refers to the communications sent by respondents\nsimply as the “letters.”\n   The letters, all essentially the same, had the heading\n“ADVERTISING MATERIAL.” The letters explained the\nlawsuit against the South Carolina dealers and asked\nrecipients to contact the respondent-lawyers if interested\nin participating in the case. Attached to the letter was a\nreply card that asked a few questions about the recipient’s\ncontact information and car purchase and ended with the\nsentence “I am interested in participating” followed by a\nsignature line. The text of the letter and reply are set out\nin full in the Appendix, infra.\n   In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Professional\nConduct 7.3 (2012), which regulates the solicitation of\nprospective clients, respondents filed a copy of the letter\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand a list of recipients’ names and addresses with the\nSouth Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\n  In June 2007, respondents sought to amend their com-\nplaint to add 247 plaintiffs. The court denied leave to\namend and held the named plaintiffs had standing to sue\nonly those dealerships from which they had purchased\nautomobiles and any alleged co-conspirators. In Septem-\nber 2007, respondents filed two new lawsuits on behalf of\nthe additional car buyers. Those subsequent cases were\nconsolidated with the Herron suit. All claims against\ndealerships without a corresponding plaintiff-purchaser\nwere dropped.\n                            B\n  In the case now before the Court, petitioners are South\nCarolina residents whose personal information was ob-\ntained by respondents from the South Carolina DMV and\nused without their consent to send solicitation letters\nasking them to join the lawsuits against the car dealer-\nships. Petitioner Edward Maracich received one of the\nletters in March 2007. While his personal information had\nbeen disclosed to respondents because he was one of many\nbuyers from a particular dealership, Maracich also hap-\npened to be the dealership’s director of sales and market-\ning. Petitioners Martha Weeks and John Tanner received\nletters from respondents in May 2007. In response to the\nletter, Tanner called Richard Harpootlian, one of the\nrespondent attorneys listed on the letter. According to\nTanner, Harpootlian made an aggressive sales pitch to\nsign Tanner as a client for the lawsuit without asking\nabout the circumstances of his purchase.\n  In 2009, petitioners filed the instant putative class-\naction lawsuit in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of South Carolina. The complaint alleged that\nrespondents had violated the DPPA by obtaining, disclos-\ning, and using personal information from motor vehicle\n6                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrecords for bulk solicitation without the express consent of\npetitioners and the other class members.\n   Respondents moved to dismiss. The information, they\ncontended, was subject to disclosure because it falls within\ntwo statutory exceptions in the DPPA: (b)(1), pertaining to\ngovernmental functions, and (b)(4), pertaining to litiga-\ntion. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Dis-\ntrict Court held as a matter of law that respondents’\nletters were not solicitations and that the use of information\nfell within the (b)(4) litigation exception. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 61a. The District Court also found that respondents’\nuse of personal information was permitted under the (b)(1)\ngovernmental-function exception.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nUnlike the District Court, it found that the letters were\n“solicitation[s]” within the meaning of the DPPA; but it\nheld further that when “solicitation is an accepted and\nexpected element of, and is inextricably intertwined with,\nconduct satisfying the litigation exception under the\nDPPA, such solicitation is not actionable.” 675 F. 3d 281,\n284 (2012). This Court granted certiorari to address\nwhether the solicitation of clients is a permissible purpose\nfor obtaining personal information from a state DMV\nunder the DPPA’s (b)(4) exception. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                            II\n  To obtain a driver’s license or register a vehicle, state\nDMVs, as a general rule, require an individual to disclose\ndetailed personal information, including name, home\naddress, telephone number, Social Security number, and\nmedical information. See Reno v. Condon, 528 U. S. 141,\n143 (2000). The enactment of the DPPA responded to at\nleast two concerns over the personal information con-\ntained in state motor vehicle records. The first was a\ngrowing threat from stalkers and criminals who could\nacquire personal information from state DMVs. The se-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncond concern related to the States’ common practice of\nselling personal information to businesses engaged in\ndirect marketing and solicitation. To address these con-\ncerns, the DPPA “establishes a regulatory scheme that\nrestricts the States’ ability to disclose a driver’s personal\ninformation without the driver’s consent.” Id., at 144.\n   The DPPA provides that, unless one of its exceptions\napplies, a state DMV “shall not knowingly disclose or\notherwise make available” “personal information” and\n“highly restricted personal information.” §§2721(a)(1)–(2).\n“[P]ersonal information” is “information that identifies an\nindividual, including [a] . . . driver identification number,\nname, address . . . , [or] telephone number, . . . but does\nnot include information on vehicular accidents, driving\nviolations, and driver’s status.” §2725(3). “[H]ighly re-\nstricted personal information” is defined as “an individu-\nal’s photograph or image, social security number, [and]\nmedical or disability information.” §2725(4). The DPPA\nmakes it unlawful “for any person knowingly to obtain or\ndisclose personal information, from a motor vehicle record,\nfor any use not permitted under section 2721(b) of this\ntitle.” §2722(a). A person “who knowingly obtains, dis-\ncloses or uses personal information, from a motor vehicle\nrecord, for a purpose not permitted under this chapter\nshall be liable to the individual to whom the information\npertains.” §2724(a).\n   The DPPA’s disclosure ban is subject to 14 exceptions\nset forth in §2721(b), for which personal information “may\nbe disclosed.” The two exceptions most relevant for the\npurpose of this case are the litigation exception in subsec-\ntion (b)(4) and the solicitation exception in (b)(12).\n   The (b)(4) litigation exception is one of the four provi-\nsions permitting disclosure not only of personal infor-\nmation but also of highly restricted personal information.\n§2721(b)(4); §2725(4). It provides that information may be\ndisclosed:\n8                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “For use in connection with any civil, criminal, ad-\n    ministrative, or arbitral proceeding in any Federal,\n    State, or local court or agency or before any self-\n    regulatory body, including the service of process,\n    investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the exe-\n    cution or enforcement of judgments and orders, or pur-\n    suant to an order of a Federal, State, or local court.”\n  The (b)(12) solicitation exception provides that certain\npersonal information, not including highly restricted\npersonal information, may be disclosed:\n       “For bulk distribution for surveys, marketing, or so-\n    licitations if the State has obtained the express con-\n    sent of the person to whom such personal information\n    pertains.”\nThe solicitation exception was originally enacted as an\nopt-out provision, allowing state DMVs to disclose personal\ninformation for purposes of solicitation only if the DMV\ngave individuals an opportunity to prohibit such disclo-\nsures. §2721(b)(12) (1994 ed.). In 1999, Congress changed\nto an opt-in regime, requiring a driver’s affirmative con-\nsent before solicitations could be sent. See Condon, supra,\nat 144–145.\n                             III\n  Respondents’ liability depends on whether their use of\npersonal information acquired from the South Carolina\nDMV to solicit clients constitutes a permissible purpose\nunder the DPPA. The District Court held that respond-\nents’ conduct was permissible both under the (b)(1) and\n(b)(4) exceptions. The Court of Appeals ruled that the\nconduct here was permissible under (b)(4); but, unlike the\nDistrict Court, it did not address the alternative argument\nthat the conduct was also permissible under (b)(1). As in\nthe Court of Appeals, only the (b)(4) exception is discussed\nhere.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

First, disclosure of personal information\nis permitted for use “in connection with any civil, criminal,\nadministrative, or arbitral proceeding.”         §2721(b)(4).\nSecond, a use in connection with litigation includes “inves-\ntigation in anticipation of litigation.” Ibid. Respondents\ncontend that the solicitation of prospective clients, espe-\ncially in the circumstances of this case, is both a use “in\nconnection with” litigation and “investigation in anticipa-\ntion of litigation.”\n                               1\n   If considered in isolation, and without reference to the\nstructure and purpose of the DPPA, (b)(4)’s exception\nallowing disclosure of personal information “for use in\nconnection with any civil, criminal, administrative, or\narbitral proceeding,” and for “investigation in anticipation\nof litigation,” is susceptible to a broad interpretation.\nThat language, in literal terms, could be interpreted to its\nbroadest reach to include the personal information that\nrespondents obtained here. But if no limits are placed on\nthe text of the exception, then all uses of personal infor-\nmation with a remote relation to litigation would be ex-\nempt under (b)(4). The phrase “in connection with” is\nessentially “indeterminat[e]” because connections, like\nrelations, “ ‘stop nowhere.’ ” New York State Conference of\nBlue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514\nU. S. 645, 655 (1995). So the phrase “in connection with”\nprovides little guidance without a limiting principle con-\nsistent with the structure of the statute and its other\nprovisions. See id., at 656 (“We simply must go beyond\nthe unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining\n[‘connection with’], and look instead to the objectives of the\nERISA statute”); see also California Div. of Labor Stand­\n10                  MARACICH v.

S. 316, 335 (1997) (“But applying the ‘relate to’ provi-\nsion according to its terms was a project doomed to failure,\nsince, as many a curbstone philosopher has observed,\neverything is related to everything else”).\n   An interpretation of (b)(4) that is consistent with the\nstatutory framework and design is also required because\n(b)(4) is an exception to both the DPPA’s general prohibi-\ntion against disclosure of “personal information” and its\nban on release of “highly restricted personal information.”\n§§2721(a)(1)–(2). An exception to a “general statement of\npolicy” is “usually read . . . narrowly in order to preserve\nthe primary operation of the provision.” Commissioner v.\nClark, 489 U. S. 726, 739 (1989). It is true that the\nDPPA’s 14 exceptions permit disclosure of personal infor-\nmation in a range of circumstances. Unless commanded\nby the text, however, these exceptions ought not operate to\nthe farthest reach of their linguistic possibilities if that\nresult would contravene the statutory design. Cf.

The “in connection with”\nlanguage in (b)(4) must have a limit. A logical and neces-\nsary conclusion is that an attorney’s solicitation of pro-\nspective clients falls outside of that limit.\n   The proposition that solicitation is a distinct form of\nconduct, separate from the conduct in connection with\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

As this opinion explains in more detail, the\nstatute itself, in (b)(12), treats bulk solicitation absent\nconsent as a discrete act that the statute prohibits. And\nthe limited examples of permissible litigation purposes\nprovided in (b)(4) are distinct from the ordinary commer-\ncial purpose of solicitation. Canons of ethics used by bar\nassociations treat solicitation as a discrete act, an act\nsubject to specific regulation. And state statutes, includ-\ning statutes of the State of South Carolina, treat solicita-\ntion as a discrete subject for regulation and governance of\nthe profession. It would contradict the idea that solicita-\ntion is defined conduct apart from litigation to treat it as\nsimply another aspect of the litigation duties set out in\n(b)(4).\n                               2\n   An attorney’s solicitation of new clients is distinct from\nother aspects of the legal profession. “It is no less true\nthan trite that lawyers must operate in a three-fold capac-\nity, as self-employed businessmen as it were, as trusted\nagents of their clients, and as assistants to the court in\nsearch of a just solution to disputes.” Cohen v. Hurley, 366\nU. S. 117, 124 (1961), overruled on other grounds, Spevack\nv. Klein, 385 U. S. 511 (1967). Unlike an attorney’s\nconduct performed on behalf of his client or the court,\n“solicitation by a lawyer of remunerative employment is a\nbusiness transaction.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436\nU. S. 447, 457 (1978); see also Zauderer v. Office of Disci­\nplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626,\n637 (1985) (attorney solicitation “ ‘propose[s] a commercial\ntransaction’ ”). The “pecuniary motivation of the lawyer\n12                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwho solicits a particular representation” may even “create\nspecial problems of conflict of interest.” Ohralik, supra, at\n461, n. 19.\n   The distinction between solicitation and an attorney’s\nother duties is also recognized and regulated by state bars\nor their governing bodies, which treat solicitation as dis-\ncrete professional conduct. See, e.g., Cal. Rule Prof. Con-\nduct 1–400 (2013); N. Y. Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3 (2012–\n2013); Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof. Conduct 7.02–7.03\n(2013); Va. Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3 (Supp. 2012). That,\nindeed, was true here. Respondents were required by the\nSouth Carolina rules of ethics to include certain language\nin their solicitation letters and to file copies with the\nSouth Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel. See S. C.\nRule Prof. Conduct 7.3. Given the difference between an\nattorney’s commercial solicitation of clients and his duties\nas an officer of the court, the proper reading of (b)(4) is\nthat solicitation falls outside of the litigation exception.\nAnd when (b)(4) is interpreted not to give attorneys the\nprivilege of using protected personal information to pro-\npose a commercial transaction, the statute is limited by\nterms and categories that have meaning in the regular\ncourse of professional practice.\n   The exclusion of solicitation from the meaning of “in\nconnection with” litigation draws further support from the\nexamples of permissible litigation uses in (b)(4). The\nfamiliar canon of noscitur a sociis, the interpretive rule\nthat “words and people are known by their companions,”\nGutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000), provides in-\nstruction in this respect. Under this rule, the phrases “in\nconnection with” and “investigation in anticipation of\nlitigation,” which are “capable of many meanings,” Jarecki\nv. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961), can be\nconstrued in light of their accompanying words in order to\navoid giving the statutory exception “unintended breadth,”\nibid.; see also United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285,\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The listed examples are steps that ensure the\nintegrity and efficiency of an existing or imminent legal\nproceeding. This may include contacting persons who are\nalready involved in the litigation or who are necessary\nparties or witnesses. These steps are different from the\nordinary business purpose of solicitation. Here, as will be\nthe case for most solicitations, the attorneys acted without\ncourt authorization or supervision and cast a wide net,\nsending letters to over 30,000 car purchasers to let them\nknow the attorneys’ names and the attorneys’ interest in\nperforming legal services for them.\n   The examples in (b)(4) confirm, and are all consistent\nwith, protecting the professional responsibilities that\ncounsel, or the court, must discharge in the proper conduct\nof litigation. These are quite distinct from the separate\nsubject, the separate professional conduct, of soliciting\nclients. The examples suggest that the litigation exception\nhas a limited scope to permit the use of highly restricted\npersonal information when it serves an integral purpose in\na particular legal proceeding. In light of the types of\nconduct permitted by the subsection, the “in connection\nwith” language should not be read to include commercial\nsolicitations by an attorney.\n   Similarly, “investigation in anticipation of litigation” is\nbest understood to allow background research to deter-\nmine whether there is a supportable theory for a com-\n14                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplaint, a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing a\nfrivolous lawsuit, or to locate witnesses for deposition or\ntrial testimony. An interpretation of “investigation” to\ninclude commercial solicitation of new clients would ex-\npand the language in a way inconsistent with the limited\nuses given as examples in the statutory text. It must be\nnoted also that the phrase “in anticipation of litigation” is\nnot a standalone phrase. It modifies, and necessarily\nnarrows, the word “investigation.” To use the phrase “in\nanticipation of litigation” without that qualification is to\nextend the meaning of the statute far beyond its text.\n                                3\n  An additional reason to hold that (b)(4) does not permit\nsolicitation of clients is because the exception allows use of\nthe most sensitive kind of information, including medical\nand disability history and Social Security numbers. To\npermit this highly personal information to be used in\nsolicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it\nmust not be assumed, without language more clear and\nexplicit, that Congress intended to exempt attorneys from\nDPPA liability in this regard.\n  Subsection (b)(4) is one of only four exceptions in the\nstatute that permit disclosure of “highly restricted personal\ninformation,” including a person’s image, Social Security\nnumber, and medical and disability information. See\n§2721(a)(2); §2725(4). The other three exceptions that\npermit access to highly restricted personal information\ninclude: use by the government, including law enforce-\nment, see §2721(b)(1); use by an insurer in claim investi-\ngation and antifraud activities, see §2721(b)(6); and use by\nan employer to obtain or verify information as required by\nlaw, see §2721(b)(9). None of these exceptions are written\nto authorize private individuals to acquire the most re-\nstricted personal information in bulk merely to propose a\ncommercial transaction for their own financial benefit.

S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(b)(4) permitted access to highly restricted personal infor-\nmation for an attorney’s own commercial ends with-\nout governmental authorization or without consent of\nthe holder of the driver’s license, the result would be so sig-\nnificant a departure from these other exceptions that\nit counsels against adopting this interpretation of the\nstatute.\n   While the (b)(4) exception allows this sensitive infor-\nmation to be used for investigation in anticipation of\nlitigation and in the litigation itself, there is no indication\nCongress wanted to provide attorneys with a special con-\ncession to obtain medical information and Social Security\nnumbers for the purpose of soliciting new business.\n                              B\n   Limiting the reach of (b)(4) to foreclose solicitation of\nclients also respects the statutory design of the DPPA.\nThe use of protected personal information for the purpose\nof bulk solicitation is addressed explicitly by the text of\n(b)(12). Congress was aware that personal information\nfrom motor vehicle records could be used for solicitation,\nand it permitted it in circumstances that it defined, with\nthe specific safeguard of consent by the person contacted.\nSo the absence of the term “solicitation” in (b)(4) is telling.\nSubsection (b)(12) allows solicitation only of those persons\nwho have given express consent to have their names and\naddresses disclosed for this purpose. If (b)(4) were to be\ninterpreted to allow solicitation without consent, then the\nstructure of the Act, and the purpose of (b)(12), would be\ncompromised to a serious degree.\n   It is necessary and required that an interpretation of a\nphrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sen-\ntence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction\nas to its meaning. United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v.\nIndependent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439,\n455 (1993) (“ ‘[I]n expounding a statute, we must not be\n16                  MARACICH v.

The “in connection with” language\nof (b)(4) therefore must be construed within the context of\nthe DPPA as a whole, including its other exceptions.\n   This is not to say, as petitioners contend, that this is a\nstraightforward application of the specific (qualified solici-\ntation permission in (b)(12)) controlling the general (the\nundefined reach of “in connection with” and “investigation\nin anticipation of litigation” in (b)(4)). As between the two\nexceptions at issue here, it is not clear that one is always\nmore specific than the other. For while (b)(12) is more\nspecific with respect to solicitation, (b)(4) is more specific\nwith respect to litigation. The DPPA’s 14 permissible use\nexceptions, moreover, are not in all contexts mutually\nexclusive. The better reading is that each exception ad-\ndresses different conduct which may, on occasion, overlap.\nFor example, certain uses of personal information by a\ncourt may be exempt either under (b)(1) or (b)(4). If con-\nduct falls within the explicit or unambiguous scope of one\nexception, all other potentially applicable exceptions need\nnot be satisfied.\n   So the question is not which of the two exceptions con-\ntrols but whether respondents’ conduct falls within the\nlitigation exception at all. As to this question, petitioners\nare correct that the existence of the separate provision\ngoverning solicitation provides necessary context for defin-\ning the scope of (b)(4). As discussed above, the text of\n(b)(4) indicates that the exception is best read not to in-\nclude solicitation as a use “in connection with” litigation.\nBut even if there were any doubt on this point, the statu-\ntory design of the DPPA as a whole, including the (b)(12)\nexception governing solicitations, provides additional\ninstruction for construing this provision. For this reason,\nit is relevant that “ ‘Congress has enacted a comprehensive\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems\nwith specific solutions.’ ” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v.\nAmalgamated Bank, 566 U. S.___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n   Subsection (b)(12) implements an important objective of\nthe DPPA—to restrict disclosure of personal information\ncontained in motor vehicle records to businesses for the\npurpose of direct marketing and solicitation. The DPPA\nwas enacted in part to respond to the States’ common\npractice of selling personal information to businesses that\nused it for marketing and solicitations. See Condon, 528\nU. S., at 143 (“Congress found that many States . . . sell\nthis personal information to individuals and businesses”);\nid., at 148 (“The motor vehicle information which the\nStates have historically sold is used by insurers, manufac-\nturers, direct marketers, and others engaged in interstate\ncommerce to contact drivers with customized solicita-\ntions”). Congress chose to protect individual privacy by\nrequiring a state DMV to obtain the license holder’s ex-\npress consent before permitting the disclosure, acquisition,\nand use of personal information for bulk solicitation. The\nimportance of the consent requirement is highlighted by\nCongress’ decision in 1999 to change the statutory mecha-\nnism that allowed individuals protected by the Act to opt\nout to one requiring them to opt in. See id., at 144–145;\nsee also §§350(c)–(e), 113 Stat. 1025.\n   Direct marketing and solicitation present a particular\nconcern not only because these activities are of the ordi-\nnary commercial sort but also because contacting an indi-\nvidual is an affront to privacy even beyond the fact that a\nlarge number of persons have access to the personal in-\nformation. The DPPA’s (b)(5) exception illustrates this\nconcern by permitting disclosure of personal information\nfor use in research activities “so long as the personal\ninformation is not published, redisclosed, or used to con-\ntact individuals.” §2721(b)(5).\n18                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because (b)(12) represents Congress’ decision to target\nthe problem of bulk solicitation with the requirement of\nexpress consent, other exceptions should not be construed\nto interfere with this statutory mechanism unless the text\ncommands it. This is not to suggest that (b)(12) is an\noverriding rule that controls all other exceptions. It would\nnot be necessary to consider (b)(12) if another statutory\nexception applied to the relevant conduct. The relevance\nof (b)(12), however, is that it can be used as additional\nevidence of the DPPA’s statutory design to interpret ex-\nceptions whose breadth and application are uncertain.\n   Here, the phrase “in connection with” litigation in the\n(b)(4) exception, as a matter of normal usage and common\nunderstanding, does not encompass an attorney’s commer-\ncial use of DPPA-protected personal information to solicit\nnew clients. This and the other reasons given above lead\nto the conclusion that it would be incorrect to interpret the\ntext of this exception to include an attorney’s commercial\nsolicitation as a use “in connection with” litigation. And,\nunlike (b)(12), the (b)(4) exception does not require obtain-\ning an individual’s express consent before disclosing and\nusing personal information contained in state motor vehi-\ncle records. If the “in connection with” language of (b)(4)\nwere read broadly to include solicitation, an attorney could\nacquire personal information from the state DMV to send\nbulk solicitations to prospective clients without their\nexpress consent. This would create significant tension in\nthe DPPA between the litigation and solicitation excep-\ntions. That inconsistency and the concomitant undermin-\ning of the statutory design are avoided by interpreting\n(b)(4) so it does not authorize the use of personal infor-\nmation for the purpose of soliciting clients. See A. Scalia\n& B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal\nTexts 180 (2012) (“The provisions of a text should be in-\nterpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not\ncontradictory. . . . [T]here can be no justification for need-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlessly rendering provisions in conflict if they can be inter-\npreted harmoniously”).\n                              C\n   If the phrase “in connection with” in (b)(4) included\nsolicitation by lawyers, then a similar reach for that\nphrase could apply to other exceptions, resulting in fur-\nther frustration of the Act’s design. Subsection (b)(6)\nallows an insurer and certain other parties to obtain DMV\ninformation for use “in connection with . . . underwriting.”\n§2721(b)(6). If that phrase extended to solicitation, then\npersonal information protected by the DPPA could be used\nto solicit new customers for underwriting without their\nconsent. It is most doubtful that Congress intended to\nexempt insurers from the consent requirement for bulk\nsolicitations.\n   The DPPA, in subsection (b)(10), permits disclosure and\nuse of personal information “in connection with” the oper-\nation of private toll roads. If the phrase were interpreted\nto extend to all solicitations without consent, then the\nowner of a private toll road could send targeted mass\nadvertisings or direct marketing letters by using the\nprotected personal information obtained from state motor\nvehicle records. This, too, would take away much of the\nforce and effect of the (b)(12) restriction on bulk solicita-\ntion without the express consent of the person contacted.\n   When Congress did intend the phrase “in connection\nwith” to permit conduct otherwise subject to the express\nconsent requirement in (b)(12), it did so in explicit terms.\nAn illustration can be found in the interplay between\n(b)(2) and (b)(12) of the DPPA. As has been noted, (b)(12)\nprohibits disclosure of protected personal information for\nthe purpose of sending bulk distribution of surveys with-\nout the express consent of the recipients. Subsection\n(b)(2), however, permits disclosure of personal information\n“[f]or use in connection with matters of . . . motor vehicle\n20                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarket research activities, including survey research.”\n§2721(b)(2). So what the DPPA prohibits in (b)(12) it\nexplicitly allows in (b)(2), but it does so by repeating the\nsame word, “survey,” in the text of both provisions. If the\n“in connection with” language alone were sufficient to\ninclude “surveys” within (b)(2), the phrase “survey re-\nsearch” would be mere surplusage. Instead, the explicit\nreference to “survey” in (b)(2) was necessary to make clear\nthat Congress had created an exception to the (b)(12)’s\nconsent requirement for one particular type of survey.\nWhen it comes to the prohibition on “solicitations” in\n(b)(12), however, that word is not repeated in the text of\n(b)(4). This leads to the inference that Congress did not\nintend (b)(4) to include “solicitations” and thus to override\nthe express consent requirement of (b)(12).\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   Respondents concede that (b)(4) does not permit attor-\nneys to use personal information acquired from a state\nDMV to find new business in the absence of any connec-\ntion to a particular transaction, occurrence, or defect.\nThey contend, however, that a line can be drawn between\nmere trolling for clients (which is not permitted) and\nsolicitation tied to a specific legal dispute (which, respond-\nents argue, is permitted). While some solicitations may\nhave a close relationship with existing proceedings, there\nis no principled way to classify some solicitations as ac-\nceptable and others as unacceptable for the purpose of\n(b)(4). Even if solicitation were permitted only after a\nlawyer has a client or filed a lawsuit, attorneys would be\nable to circumvent this limitation with ease by the simple\ndevice of filing a placeholder lawsuit. All an attorney\nwould need is one friend or family member as his client\nbefore being able to gain access to DPPA-protected per-\nsonal information to solicit persons to fill in as plaintiffs.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitation of new plaintiffs to keep defendants in a law-\nsuit that would otherwise be dismissed for lack of standing\nis no different in substance from solicitation to initiate a\nlawsuit. Here, at any rate, the state court found that\nplaintiffs had standing to sue the dealerships from which\nthey had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-\nconspirators. See 675 F. 3d, at 287, n. 3. This can under-\nmine the argument that solicitation of additional plaintiffs\nwas somehow necessary for the lawsuit to continue.\n   Drawing the line between solicitations related to an\nexisting proceeding and those that are not is not a tenable\ndistinction. The proper solution is to draw the line at\nsolicitation itself. The structure of the DPPA supports\nthis distinction. If solicitation were deemed a permissible\npurpose under (b)(4), even when limited to a particular\nlawsuit, tension would remain between the (b)(12) solicita-\ntion exception, which requires express consent, and the\n(b)(4) litigation exception, which does not. The two statu-\ntory provisions are consistent if solicitation is excluded\nfrom the activity permitted in (b)(4).\n   Of course solicitation can aid an attorney in bringing a\nlawsuit or in increasing its size. The question, however, is\nwhether or not lawyers can use personal information\nprotected under the DPPA for this purpose. Petitioners\nand other state residents have no real choice but to dis-\nclose their personal information to the state DMV, includ-\ning highly restricted personal information. The use of that\ninformation by private actors to send direct commercial\nsolicitations without the license holder’s consent is a\nsubstantial intrusion on the individual privacy the Act\nprotects. For the reasons already discussed, a proper\ninterpretation of a use “in connection with” litigation under\n(b)(4) in light of the DPPA’s text and structure does not\ninclude solicitation.\n   The fact that an attorney complies with state bar rules\ngoverning solicitations also does not resolve whether he is\n22                 MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to access the state DMV database for that purpose\nunder the DPPA. There is no provision of South Carolina\nlaw that either permits or requires attorneys to use DPPA-\nprotected information to solicit potential clients. Even if\nsuch a provision existed, under the Supremacy Clause, it\nwould not protect respondents from DPPA liability unless\ntheir conduct fell within one of the Act’s exceptions.\n   A person is liable under the DPPA if he “knowingly\nobtains, discloses or uses personal information, from a\nmotor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted” by one\nof the statutory exceptions. §2724(a). In determining\nwhether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal in-\nformation is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the\nproper inquiry is whether the defendant had the predomi-\nnant purpose to solicit. Because, in some cases, a commu-\nnication sent with DPPA-protected information may serve\nmore than one objective, a court must discern whether\nsolicitation is its predominant purpose. That purpose\nmight be evident from the communication itself. In other\ninstances the defendant’s whole course of conduct will be\nrelevant in determining whether solicitation was the\npredominant purpose of the act alleged to be wrongful.\n   Close cases may arise. Where a communication seeks to\nprovide class notice or locate a witness, for example, the\nfact that the attorney provides contact information for a\nreply likely would not make the communication an im-\nproper solicitation. And the fact that a letter follows the\nstate bar rules governing attorney solicitations, although\nrelevant, will not be dispositive. For example, if the pre-\ndominant purpose of a letter was not to solicit a new cli-\nent, but rather to ask a witness investigatory questions or\nto secure her testimony at trial, adherence to state bar\nsolicitation rules would not subject the sender to DPPA\nliability. Subsequent conduct, in some cases, may show\nthat solicitation in fact was the predominant purpose of an\nearlier act; and, of course, even if an initial request was\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproper, a later use may be a violation. Where a reason-\nable observer could discern that the predominant purpose\nof obtaining, using, or disclosing protected personal\ninformation was to initiate or propose a business trans-\naction with a prospective client, (b)(4) does not exempt the\nsolicitation.\n   Respondents contend that even if solicitation of clients\nis impermissible as a general rule, solicitation to aggre-\ngate a class action suit is permitted under (b)(4). Where\nthe predominant purpose is solicitation, however, (b)(4)\ndoes not entitle attorneys to obtain and use DPPA-\nprotected information. To the extent the solicitation of\nplaintiffs can help attorneys bring a larger class action,\nthere are alternatives that do not sacrifice an individual’s\nprivacy in his or her motor vehicle records. An attorney,\npursuant to a court order, could send class notice. Class\nnotice may prompt a class member to join the lawsuit, but\nit also serves the important purpose of protecting the\nrights of absent class members and ensures that any\ndecision will be binding on the class. Class notice sent on\nthe instruction of the court also does not raise the same\nconcerns that attorneys are acting only in their own com-\nmercial interest. But respondents here did not obtain or\nuse the protected personal information to send class no-\ntices or comply with a court order. The letters made no\nmention of ethical obligations to outstanding group mem-\nbers or the consequences of not joining the suit. As the\nCourt of Appeals noted, respondents “failed to indicate to\nrecipients that they may already be de facto clients of the\nLawyers, that is, persons whose interests were already\nprotected by the senders.” 675 F. 3d, at 293. Had re-\nspondents received a court order, they might have been\nable to rely on the explicit language in (b)(4) permitting\nuses of information “pursuant to an order of a Federal,\nState, or local court.” §2721(b)(4). But because respond-\nents had no court order authorizing their conduct, this\n24                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nopinion need not address whether it would be proper for a\ncourt to order attorneys to obtain DPPA-protected personal\ninformation to solicit plaintiffs.\n   Attorneys are free to solicit plaintiffs through traditional\nand permitted advertising without obtaining personal\ninformation from a state DMV. Here, the attorneys could\nalso have complied with (b)(12) and limited their solicita-\ntion to those individuals who had expressly consented, or\nrespondents could have requested consent through the\nDPPA’s waiver procedure. See §2721(d).\n   In light of these and other alternatives, attorneys are\nnot without the necessary means to aggregate a class of\nplaintiffs. What they may not do, however, is to acquire\nhighly restricted personal information from state DMV\nrecords to send bulk solicitations without express consent\nfrom the targeted recipients.\n   This is not to suggest that attorneys may not obtain\nDPPA-protected personal information for a proper investi-\ngatory purpose. Where respondents obtained petitioners’\npersonal information to discern the extent of the alleged\nmisconduct or identify particular defendants, those FOIA\nrequests appear permissible under (b)(4) as “investigation\nin anticipation of litigation.” Solicitation of new business,\nhowever, is not “investigation” within the meaning of\n(b)(4). And acquiring petitioners’ personal information for\na legitimate investigatory purpose does not entitle re-\nspondents to then use that same information to send\ndirect solicitations. Each distinct disclosure or use of\npersonal information acquired from a state DMV must be\npermitted by the DPPA. See §2724(a) (“A person who\nknowingly obtains, discloses or uses personal information,\nfrom a motor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted\nunder this chapter shall be liable to the individual to\nwhom the information pertains”); see also §2721(c). If the\nstatute were to operate otherwise, obtaining personal\ninformation for one permissible use would entitle attor-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneys to use that same information at a later date for any\nother purpose. For example, a lawyer could obtain per-\nsonal information to locate witnesses for a lawsuit and\nthen use those same names and addresses later to send\ndirect marketing letters about a book he wrote.\n                              B\n   The Court of Appeals held that the letters here were\nsolicitations, finding that “a reasonable recipient would\nalmost certainly have understood the message to be a\nsolicitation from a lawyer.” Id., at 293. The court noted\nas relevant that respondents themselves took steps to\nfollow South Carolina bar rules governing attorney solici-\ntations and rejected respondents’ description of the letters\nas investigatory in nature, given that “[n]o mention was\nmade of an investigation into certain practices other than\nthe implicit suggestion of investigation during a ‘free\nconsultation.’ ” Ibid. The included reply card did not alter\nthe Court of Appeals’ finding that the communications\nwere solicitations rather than investigation. Only those\ninterested in joining the lawsuit were directed to fill out\nthe card and the only place to sign the card was under the\nphrase “I am interested in participating.” See Appendix,\ninfra, at 31. The card asked for data regarding vehicle\npurchases relevant to initiate the representation of the\nprospective clients.\n   But although the Court of Appeals found that the letters\nwere solicitations, it held the communications nonetheless\nexempt under (b)(4) because they were “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with permissible litigation purposes. 675 F. 3d, at\n284. As explained above, however, if the use of DPPA-\nprotected personal information has the predominant\npurpose of solicitation, that use is not protected by (b)(4).\nA remand is necessary for application of the proper stand-\nard because the Court of Appeals could conclude, in light\nof the content of the communications, taken with other\n26                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence in the record, that respondents’ letters had the\npredominant purpose to solicit clients.\n  On remand, the Court of Appeals should determine\nwhether the record shows that the communications\nsought, or were used, to develop the factual basis of the\nHerron complaint, locate witnesses, identify additional\ndefendants, or perform any other investigative function\nrelated to the litigation. Even if so, the question is whether\nsolicitation was the predominant purpose for sending the\nletters.\n                               V\n   This case does not involve the statutory section impos-\ning criminal liability, which is written in different terms\nthan the civil remedies provision. See §2723(a) (“A person\nwho knowingly violates this chapter shall be fined under\nthis title”). As to civil liability, the amount of damages\nsought in the complaint is based on the number of persons,\nover 30,000 individuals, whose personal and highly sensi-\ntive information was disclosed and who were solicited.\nWhether the civil damages provision in §2724, after a\ncareful and proper interpretation, would permit an award\nin this amount, and if so whether principles of due process\nand other doctrines that protect against excessive awards\nwould come into play, is not an issue argued or presented\nin this case.\n   In this framework, there is no work for the rule of lenity\nto do. This Court has held that “the rule of lenity only\napplies if, after considering text, structure, history, and\npurpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty\nin the statute such that the Court must simply guess as\nto what Congress intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (citation and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). But here, as discussed, the sur-\nrounding text and structure of the DPPA resolve any\nambiguity in phrases “in connection with” and “investiga-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in anticipation of litigation” in (b)(4). Only where “the\nlanguage or history of [the statute] is uncertain” after\nlooking to “the particular statutory language, . . . the\ndesign of the statute as a whole and to its object and poli-\ncy,” does the rule of lenity serve to give further guidance.\nCrandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). “The\nrule [of lenity] comes into operation at the end of the\nprocess of construing what Congress has expressed, not at\nthe beginning as an overriding consideration of being\nlenient to wrongdoers.” See Callanan v. United States,\n364 U. S. 587, 596 (1961). There is no room for the rule of\nlenity where the text and structure of the DPPA require\nan interpretation of (b)(4) that does not reach out to in-\nclude an attorney’s solicitation of clients.\n                             VI\n   Solicitation of prospective clients is not a permissible\nuse “in connection with” litigation or “investigation in\nanticipation of litigation” under (b)(4) of the DPPA. As a\nresult, the Court of Appeals erred in granting respondents\nsummary judgment without first determining whether the\ncommunications had the predominant purpose of solicita-\ntion. And since the solicited persons did not give express\nconsent to the disclosure or use of their personal infor-\nmation for this purpose, the (b)(12) exception does not\napply.\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals, or the District Court,\nmust determine whether respondents’ letters, viewed\nobjectively, had the predominant purpose of solicitation.\nThe Court of Appeals’ finding that these letters were\nsolicitations can be the basis for the further conclusion\nthat solicitation was the predominant purpose of their\ntransmission. Because the Court of Appeals applied the\nwrong standard in finding these solicitations exempt\nunder (b)(4), however, the Court remands for application\nof the proper standard.\n28                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Further proceedings also may be required to determine\nwhether the initial act of obtaining petitioners’ personal\ninformation was permitted under the DPPA. The Court of\nAppeals and the District Court seem to have agreed that\nthe first two FOIA requests were made in order for re-\nspondents to decide whether to file the MDDA lawsuit as a\ngroup action and to identify the highest volume dealers.\nApp. 39a. If, in light of this opinion, the courts on remand\nadhere to the determination that the first two FOIA\nrequests were exempt under (b)(4), the later uses and dis-\nclosures of that information, nevertheless, may be independ-\nent violations of the DPPA.\n   If the use of petitioners’ personal information to send\nthe letters in this case is deemed to be a violation of the\nAct, then the courts can decide if it remains relevant and\nnecessary, for liability and damages purposes, to deter-\nmine whether the last four FOIA requests were also in\nviolation of the DPPA. Assuming violations of the DPPA\nare established, questions regarding the calculation and\nassessment of damages then can be considered.\n   Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has consid-\nered whether respondents’ conduct was permissible under\nthe (b)(1) governmental-function exception.          Whether\nsolicitation would be permitted conduct under (b)(1) is not\nresolved by this case. This case turns on the interpreta-\ntion of “in connection with” litigation and “investigation in\nanticipation of litigation,” phrases not included in (b)(1).\nWhere personal information is used for the predominant\npurpose of solicitation, the fact that the solicitation itself\nmay serve a governmental function is not relevant to the\ninterpretation of (b)(4). It may, however, be relevant to\nthe (b)(1) inquiry. Respondents’ argument that they were\nauthorized under state law to act as private attorneys\ngeneral on behalf of the State is properly addressed under\n(b)(1).

In connection with that litigation, the lawyers\nobtained from South Carolina’s Department of Motor\nVehicles (DMV) information identifying buyers who may\nhave been charged unlawful fees and dealers who may\nhave conspired to exact those fees. The lawyers subse-\nquently sent letters to the identified buyers inquiring\nwhether they had been charged administrative fees, in-\nforming them of the litigation, and inviting them to join as\nplaintiffs. The courts below determined that the lawyers’\nrequests for the information and their use of it fell squarely\nwithin the litigation exception to the Driver’s Privacy\nProtection Act of 1994 (DPPA), 18 U. S. C. §2721(b)(4),\nand that the Act’s limitation on solicitation, §2721(b)(12),\ndid not override the litigation exception. I would affirm\nthat sound judgment. As the Fourth Circuit explained,\nrespondents “did what any good lawyer would have done.”\n675 F. 3d 281, 298 (2012). This Court’s holding, exposing\nrespondents not only to astronomical liquidated damages,\n§2724(b)(1), but to criminal fines as well, §2723(a), is\nscarcely what Congress ordered in enacting the DPPA.\n2                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Respondent-lawyers obtained and used DMV infor-\nmation for “investigation in anticipation of litigation” and\nfor communications “in connection with” a civil action. I\nwould read that statutory language to permit use of DMV\ninformation tied to a specific, concrete proceeding, immi-\nnent or ongoing, with identified parties on both sides of\nthe controversy. So read, §2721(b)(4) permitted the law-\nyers’ conduct. Neither §2721(b)(12) nor any other provi-\nsion of the DPPA warrants the massive liability this\nCourt’s judgment authorizes.\n                              I\n   Public concern regarding the ability of criminals and\nstalkers to obtain information about potential victims\nprompted Congress, in 1994, to enact the DPPA. A partic-\nular spur to action was the 1989 murder of the television\nactress Rebecca Schaeffer by a fan who had obtained her\naddress from the California DMV. Taylor v. Acxiom Corp.,\n612 F. 3d 325, 336 (CA5 2010); Electronic Privacy Infor-\nmation Center, The Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA)\nand the Privacy of Your State Motor Vehicle Record,\nhttp://www.epic.org/privacy/drivers/ (as visited June 14,\n2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). See also\n139 Cong. Rec. 29470 (1993) (remarks of Sen. Biden).\nCongress sought to close what it saw as a loophole caused\nby state laws allowing requesters to gain access to personal\ninformation without a legitimate purpose. Addressing\nthat problem, Congress established a “regulatory scheme\nthat restricts the States’ ability to disclose a driver’s per-\nsonal information without the driver’s consent.” Ante, at 7\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The DPPA generally prohibits any state DMV from\n“knowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to\nany person” personal information about any individual.\n18 U. S. C. §2721(a). This prohibition is subject to a num-\nber of statutory exceptions, including stated purposes for\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The 14\npermitted uses of DMV data are designed to “strik[e] a\ncritical balance between an individual’s fundamental right\nto privacy and safety and the legitimate governmental and\nbusiness needs for th[e] information.” 140 Cong. Rec. 7925\n(1994) (remarks of Rep. Moran). State DMVs may release\ninformation for any one of these permitted purposes, but\nthey are not required to do so.\n   This case arises from a state-court lawsuit—the Herron\nlitigation—to enforce the South Carolina Regulation of\nManufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (MDDA),\nS. C. Code Ann. §56–15–10 et seq. (2006 and Supp. 2011).\nRespondent-lawyers were approached by a number of\nrecent car purchasers who complained that they had been\ncharged unlawful fees. On behalf of the car purchasers,\nthe lawyers filed a complaint alleging that the car dealer-\nships had violated state law. The initial complaint identi-\nfied four purchasers as named plaintiffs and 51 dealers as\ndefendants; the pleading was soon amended to name eight\nplaintiffs and, as defendants, 324 dealers. 675 F. 3d, at\n285. The complaint invoked the MDDA’s representative\naction provision, which allows an individual to act as a\nprivate attorney general bringing suit “for the benefit of\nthe whole.” S. C. Code Ann. §56–15–110(2). Ultimately,\nthe Herron litigation yielded a declaratory judgment that\nthe dealers had indeed violated state law. Subsequent\nsettlements gained monetary relief for over 30,000 over-\ncharged car purchasers. The state court found that the\nHerron plaintiffs, “as private attorneys general, [had]\nrepresented the public interest in attempting to regulate\nallegedly unfair practices by motor vehicle dealers and\ntherefore represent all those affected by such practices.”\nApp. 253–254.\n   Respondent-lawyers obtained and used information\nfrom the state DMV both shortly before filing suit and\n4                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nduring the pendency of the state-court litigation. Before\nfiling suit, they asked the DMV for information about\nrecent car purchases in six South Carolina counties.\nThese requests explained that respondent-lawyers repre-\nsented a group of “plaintiffs who have complained of cer-\ntain conduct as a result of their transactions with car\ndealers,” and that the lawyers were “attempting to deter-\nmine if this [conduct was] a common practice.” 675 F. 3d,\nat 284 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   After the lawsuit was filed, respondent-lawyers obtained\nthe names of persons who had purchased cars from the\ndealers they had identified as defendants and mailed\nletters to those purchasers. Ante, at 4. These dispatches\nare the actions that, in the Court’s view, render respondent-\nlawyers potentially liable for violating the DPPA. To\ndetermine whether the DPPA authorized the respondent-\nlawyers’ uses of DMV information, I first consider the\nposture of the Herron litigation at the time of the mailings\nto car purchasers. The complaint filed by respondent-\nlawyers on behalf of the car purchasers alleged that the\ndealers were involved in a conspiracy to charge unlawful\nfees. App. 138–139. In a competitive market, the lawyers\nurged, such conduct can succeed only when done in concert\nwith other dealers; otherwise, consumers would take their\nbusiness elsewhere. Meanwhile, the dealers moved to\ndismiss the conspiracy claim and argued there was no\nparty with standing to sue those dealers who had not sold\na car to a named plaintiff. Id., at 155.\n   The state court denied the dealers’ motion to dismiss,\nstating that the complaint alleged sufficient facts “sup-\nporting standing of the plaintiffs to proceed” against all\ndefendants, and that there were “sufficient allegations of\ncivil conspiracy” to avoid threshold dismissal of that claim.\nId., at 212. At a subsequent hearing, the state court clari-\nfied that respondent-lawyers could “go forward with eight\npeople [the named plaintiffs]” and the court would consider\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

In\nthat endeavor, as the Fourth Circuit recognized, they “did\nwhat any good lawyer would have done.” 675 F. 3d, at\n298.\n   This context illuminates how the letters at issue in this\ncase—which were mailed after the complaint was filed and\nwhile the dealers’ motion to dismiss was pending—served\nto advance the representative character of the suit during\na critical time in the Herron litigation. The letters included\na card asking recipients to respond by stating the type\nof car they had purchased, the name of the dealer and date\nof purchase, whether they had been charged the allegedly\nunlawful fee and, if so, the amount of the fee, and whether\nthey were interested in participating in the lawsuit. See,\ne.g., App. 93, 106.

See ante, at 21. In fact, the state court left room for the\ndealer-defendants to renew their standing objection on completion of\ndiscovery.\n  2 The dealers thus were urging that additional plaintiffs were “neces-\n\nsary” to the maintenance of the dealer-conspiracy charge.

Inquiries\ngeared to discovering the victims of the conspiracy cannot plausibly be\nwritten off as entirely noninvestigative in character. The Fourth\nCircuit so comprehended: “[T]he [l]awyers were looking to build and\nbolster a case against the dealerships if their initial information from\nconsumers proved the existence of plausibly systemic violations of the\nDealers Act.” 675 F. 3d 281, 299 (2012). The Court asserts that the\nCourt of Appeals “rejected respondents’ description of the letters as\ninvestigatory in nature.” Ante, at 25. That tells half the story. True,\nthe Fourth Circuit disagreed with the District Court’s determination\nthat “the [l]awyers were not engaged in [any] solicitation.” 675 F. 3d,\nat 293. But the appeals court twice clarified that, in developing the suit\nagainst the car dealers, the respondent-lawyers engaged in both inves-\ntigation and solicitation; indeed, the Fourth Circuit described the two\nas “inextricably intertwined.” Id., at 294, 300. No place did the Court\nof Appeals find that the communications were solicitations only, not at\nall “investigative.” In asserting otherwise, ante, at 25, the Court\nindulges in wishful thinking.\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The\nCourt’s attempt to read a solicitation-specific limitation\ninto this provision has no mooring in §2721(b)(4)’s text and\nmisperceives the structure of the DPPA.\n                              A\n   Congress used expansive language in framing the\n§2721(b)(4) exception, starting with the words “in connec-\ntion with” and thrice repeating the word “any.” See Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383\n(1992) (“The ordinary meaning of th[e] words [‘relating to’]\nis a broad one.”); Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance\nPlastics Corp., 563 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7)\n(“[T]he phrase ‘any complaint’ suggests a broad interpreta-\ntion.”). Notably, the Court acknowledges that (b)(4) is\n“susceptible to a broad interpretation,” and, “in literal\nterms,” could be read “to include the personal information\nthat [respondent-lawyers] obtained here.” Ante, at 9.\n   This case should therefore be easy. One need not strain\nto see the connection between the respondent-lawyers’\nconduct and a specific civil proceeding. No attenuated\nchain of connection need be established. All the uses of\nDMV information at issue took place when a concrete civil\naction between identified parties was either imminent or\npending. Thus, the uses were indisputably “in connection\nwith” a civil proceeding.\n   The Court apparently recognizes that the initial re-\nquests for DMV information—to investigate the vitality of\nthe claims before filing suit—were in connection with the\nlitigation. See ante, at 27–28. But if anything, the later\nrequests and the letters mailed to car purchasers were\neven more closely tied to the case. The letters were sent\nafter litigation commenced, when the respondent-lawyers,\non behalf of their clients, were pursuing conspiracy claims\n8                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nagainst each of the defendant car dealers. Of equal im-\nportance, because the suit qualified under state law as a\nrepresentative action, respondent-lawyers represented\nand were obligated to serve the interests of all car pur-\nchasers affected by the charged illegal conduct. Respondent-\nlawyers’ uses of DMV information in aid of the Herron\nlitigation facilitated the discharge of their professional\nobligations to the court, their individual clients, and the\n“whole” group of named and unnamed purchasers that\nstate law required the lawyers to serve. S. C. Code Ann.\n§56–15–110(2).\n    It would be extraordinary for Congress to pass a law\ndisturbing the processes of a state court in such a case.\n“[T]he National Government, anxious though it may be to\nvindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests,\nalways endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly\ninterfere with the legitimate activities of the States,” and\nthis includes a general “deference to the state adjudicative\nprocess.” Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 15–16) (quoting Younger v. Harris,\n401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971)). We have taken special care to\nemphasize “the State’s strong interest in regulating mem-\nbers of the Bar,” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436\nU. S. 447, 467 (1978), and have cautioned against undue\n“Federal interference with a State’s traditional regulation\nof [the legal] profession,” Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433\nU. S. 350, 362 (1977). One would therefore expect Con-\ngress to speak clearly if it intended to trench on state\ncontrol in this domain.\n    I find no such clear statement in the DPPA. Quite the\ncontrary, the DPPA instructs that “use [of DMV infor-\nmation] in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any\n. . . State . . . court” is permissible under federal law.\n§2721(b)(4).\n                              B\n    Rather than adopt a straightforward interpretation of\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe statute, the Court labors to justify reading a limitation\ninto (b)(4) that has no basis in the text of that provision.\nSolicitation, the Court says, is not permissible under (b)(4)\neven if it targets a specific civil proceeding. The Court\noffers two primary arguments for this conclusion. First,\nthe Court contends, a bar on solicitation must be read into\n(b)(4) lest that provision permit all uses “with a remote\nrelation to litigation.” Ante, at 9. Second, the Court as-\nserts, its interpretation is necessary to respect the “struc-\nture and purpose of the DPPA” and the “objective” of\nsubsection (b)(12). Ante, at 9, 17. Neither argument is\npersuasive.\n   I agree with the Court that the words “in connection\nwith” must be contained within reasonable bounds. But\nthe Court immediately jumps from this premise to the\nconclusion that “an attorney’s solicitation of prospective\nclients falls outside of [any reasonable] limit.” Ante, at\n10–11; ante, at 11, 13 (solicitation, a “discrete act” prohib-\nited by the statute, allows no exception for conduct “in\nconnection with litigation”). The leap is startling. In prior\ndecisions, when the Court has sought a limiting principle\nfor similar statutory language, it has done so to prevent\nthe application of a statute to matters with “only a tenu-\nous, remote, or peripheral connection” to the statute’s core\npurpose. New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue\nShield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 661\n(1995) (quoting District of Columbia v. Greater Washing-\nton Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S. 125, 130, n. 1 (1992)). The\nfocus, in other words, has been on the degree of connection\nbetween the concerns central to the law and the disputed\napplication of the measure.\n   The majority’s focus on solicitation, however, tells us\nalmost nothing about the degree of connection between the\nuse of DMV information and a civil proceeding. It matters\nnot to the Court whether a solicitation is of vital im-\nportance to an ongoing proceeding or far removed from\n10                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nany proceeding which may or may not be brought. A rule\nbarring any communication for which solicitation is a\npredominant purpose bears no logical relationship to the\n§2721(b)(4) phrase “in connection with.” And the majori-\nty’s concentration on solicitation is uninformative on the\ndegree of connection to a civil proceeding needed for uses\nof DMV information that do not involve solicitation.\n   The majority’s sojourn away from §2721(b)(4)’s text in\nsearch of a limiting principle is unwarranted. A limit to\nthe scope of (b)(4) can be readily identified by attending to\nthe phrasing of the provision and its focus on a “proceed-\ning.” Congress used similar language in the obstruction of\njustice statute, which criminalizes various attempts to\ninterfere with a “proceeding.” 18 U. S. C. §1512. The\nCourt had no difficulty identifying a limiting principle in\nthis term; it held that the statute applies only to persons\nwho “have in contemplation any particular official pro-\nceeding.” Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U. S.\n696, 708 (2005). By the same token, (b)(4) is best inter-\npreted to permit only uses tied to a concrete, particular\nproceeding.\n   Congress’ use of the phrase “in anticipation of litigation”\nprovides further support for this interpretation. The\nphrase is hardly unique to (b)(4); it is commonly used to\nrefer to the time at which the work-product privilege\nattaches to an attorney’s work for a client and the time at\nwhich a party has a duty to preserve material evidence.\nSee, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(3) (“documents and\nother tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation” are not discoverable); Silvestri v. General Mo-\ntors Corp., 271 F. 3d 583, 592 (CA4 2001) (plaintiff had\n“failed to preserve material evidence in anticipation of\nlitigation”). Both now and when the DPPA was enacted,\ncourts have understood this phrase to require a concrete\ndispute between parties, and to exclude the abstract pos-\nsibility of a hypothetical lawsuit. See, e.g., National Union\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    11\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F. 2d 980, 984\n(CA4 1992) (the “general possibility of litigation” is not\nenough; a document is prepared in anticipation of litiga-\ntion when there is “an actual claim or a potential claim\nfollowing an actual event or series of events that reasona-\nbly could result in litigation”); Gould Inc. v. Mitsui Mining\n& Smelting Co., 825 F. 2d 676, 680 (CA2 1987) (applica-\ntion of Rule 26(b)(3) “depends upon the existence of a real,\nrather than speculative, concern”).\n   Usage of the same words in other prescriptions indicates\nthat (b)(4) is indeed limited by its text. A hypothetical\ncase without identified adverse parties is not encompassed\nby (b)(4). To anticipate a particular civil proceeding, a\nlawyer must have a client whose claim presents a genuine\ncontroversy.4 Trolling for prospective clients with no\nactual or imminent proceeding, involving already identi-\nfied adverse parties, in sight—apparently, the Court’s\nprimary concern—would not be a permissible use.5 Af-\nfirming the judgment below, the Court fears, would permit\nlawyers to bring placeholder lawsuits on behalf of\n“friend[s] or family member[s],” then use DMV data to\nsolicit plaintiffs for “a lawsuit that would otherwise be\ndismissed for lack of standing.” Ante, at 20–21. This is a\ncanard. No court would hold such a case a genuine con-\n——————\n   4 Respondent-lawyers propose a broader reading of (b)(4), arguing\n\nthat any use tied to an identified “transaction, occurrence, [or] defect”\nshould be permissible. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Their reading, however,\nfails to account for all the words in (b)(4), most notably the provision’s\nfocus on a “proceeding.” See Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544\nU. S. 696, 707–708, and n. 10 (2005) (destroying evidence of suspicious\ntransactions could not give rise to liability under 18 U. S. C. §1512\nunless done in contemplation of a particular proceeding).\n   5 Furthermore, a use consistent with federal law may nevertheless be\n\nimpermissible. The State makes the ultimate choice whether to release\nDMV information for any purpose under (b)(4). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.\nStates are well suited to policing attorney conduct, a sphere of tradi-\ntional state authority.\n12                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntroversy. The Court’s hypothetical bears not even a re-\nmote resemblance to the facts of this case. The state court\nhere denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the conspir-\nacy claim on standing grounds. Supra, at 4–5. See also\nante, at 5 (describing the state court’s ruling that the\nnamed plaintiffs had standing to sue the “dealerships from\nwhich they had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-\nconspirators” (emphasis added)).\n   This case is squarely within the metes and bounds of\n(b)(4). The letters advanced the concrete interests of the\nrespondent-lawyers’ clients within a pending adversarial\ncivil proceeding in state court. Just as the letters at issue\nin this case would be in contemplation of a particular\n“proceeding” as that term is used in 18 U. S. C. §1512, and\nwould be “in anticipation of litigation” as Rule 26(b)(3)\nemploys that term, they fall within the very same lan-\nguage as it appears in §2721(b)(4).\n   The Court’s second argument is no more convincing. A\nsevere limit must be read into (b)(4), the Court urges, to\nrespect the structure of the statute. Specifically, the\nCourt spotlights that another permissible use, (b)(12),\nallows “bulk distribution for surveys, marketing or solici-\ntations,” but only to individuals who have consented to\nallow use of their information for this purpose. Petitioners\nhere devoted much of their briefing to arguing that (b)(12)\nis somehow more “specific” than (b)(4), see Brief for Peti-\ntioners 18–31; Reply Brief 3–12, but the Court rightly\nrejects that reasoning. Ante, at 16. Neither provision is\nmore specific than the other; the two simply cover differ-\nent subjects.\n   Without the specific-governs-the-general canon, the case\nfor using (b)(12) to interpret (b)(4) evaporates. The Court\nsuggests there would be “tension” between the two provi-\nsions if a use of DMV information were permitted by (b)(4)\nbut not permitted by (b)(12). Ante, at 21. Every permissi-\nble use of DMV information, however, is permitted by\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   13\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsome—often just one—of the 14 enumerated exceptions\nand not permitted by others. The DPPA surely does not\nconvey that every time a person obtains DMV information\nin accord with one exception, that exception comes into\nconflict with other exceptions under which the information\ncould not be obtained. Indeed, it is the Court’s opinion\nthat creates tension, by taking a use that would be per-\nmissible under (b)(4)—and therefore permissible under the\nDPPA—and importing into it a restriction delineated in an\nentirely different exception.\n  If applied generally to §2721(b), the Court’s approach\nwould frustrate the evident congressional purpose to\nprovide a set of separate exceptions, any one of which\nmakes permissible the uses therein. Consider a consulting\ncompany hired by a State to conduct research into motor\nvehicle safety. Depending on the particulars of the re-\nsearch project, the company might seek to obtain DMV\ninformation under the uses listed in (b)(1), (2), (5), (12), or\n(14).6 These exceptions entail different requirements, so\nthe project might well fit within one or two of them but not\nthe others. It would be ludicrous to treat the fact that the\nproject did not fit within one exception as establishing\nthat the project should not be allowed under any other\nexception. Construing the DPPA in that manner would\nrender the statute totally unworkable. The majority does\nnot take that outlandish position with respect to all the\nexceptions. Ante, at 16. Instead, without any congres-\nsional instruction to do so, the Court reads (b)(12)—the\n12th on a list of 14 permissible uses—as so central a part\n——————\n  6 The exception in (b)(1) covers uses by a State or entity acting on\n\nbehalf of a State; (b)(2) covers uses for matters of motor vehicle or\ndriver safety; (b)(5) covers uses in research activities; (b)(12) covers\nuses for surveys; and (b)(14) covers uses related to the operation of a\nmotor vehicle or public safety, if authorized by state law. The degree of\noverlap among these provisions undermines the Court’s suggestion that\nthe list should be read to avoid surplusage. Ante, at 20.\n14                      MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof the DPPA that it alone narrows the scope of other\nexceptions.\n                             III\n   Under the most sensible reading of §2721(b)(4), see\nsupra, at 6–7, the uses of DMV information at issue here\nwould be permissible. The dispositive question should be:\nIs the use tied to a concrete civil action between identified\nparties that is ongoing or impending? Even if the statute\ncould be viewed as ambiguous, there is ample reason to\nadopt that straightforward reading.          The alternative\nreading embraced by the Court generates uncertainty\nregarding the scope of other uses enumerated in §2721(b);\ncreates difficult line-drawing problems; and imposes crim-\ninal and draconian civil liability, at odds with the principle\nof lenity.\n   First, the Court’s reading clouds other uses the DPPA\npermits.     According to the Court, the exceptions in\n§2721(b) should be construed so as not to “interfere” with\n(b)(12), which “implements an important objective of the\nDPPA.” Ante, at 17–18.7 Therefore, (b)(12) is “relevan[t]”\nin interpreting those “exceptions whose breadth and appli-\ncation are uncertain.” Ante, at 18. Little light is cast on\nwhich enumerated exceptions fit that description. Subsec-\ntion (b)(4) fits, the Court asserts, but (b)(1) apparently\n——————\n   7 The placement of (b)(12) toward the end of a list of 14 hardly signals\n\nits special importance. The Court cites Reno v. Condon, 528 U. S. 141,\n143, 148 (2000), but the cited passages do not so much as suggest that\n(b)(12) is more central to the congressional purpose than other excep-\ntions. From the text and history of the DPPA, it would be fair to say\nthat the driving purpose of the Act was to prevent access to information\nby criminals and stalkers, while allowing access for legitimate govern-\nmental and business purposes. See supra, at 2–3. Giving primacy to\n(b)(12) is all the more questionable, for that exception was included not\nto proscribe, but to allow, some direct marketing. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 29. Absent the provision, the DPPA would permit no such\nuse.\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)        15\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndoes not. See ibid. But what makes (b)(1) clear, while\n(b)(4) is uncertain? The Court provides no answer, not\neven a clue. Lower courts will be left to puzzle over when\n(b)(12) comes to the fore, rendering impermissible uses\nthat otherwise fit within another exception.\n   The Court sows further confusion by narrowly construing\nthe four exceptions that permit disclosure of information\nthe DPPA ranks as “highly restricted personal infor-\nmation.” §2721(a)(2); see ante, at 14. These exceptions\napply to uses by the government, (b)(1); court opera-\ntions, (b)(4); use by insurance companies, entities perva-\nsively regulated by the States, (b)(6); and commercial\ndriver’s licenses, which are regulated by the Federal Gov-\nernment and administered by the States, (b)(9).8\n   A common thread unites the four categories: All involve\nthe functioning or oversight of state governments on mat-\nters important to the State and persons within the State’s\ngovernance. For uses of this genre, the need for the in-\nformation can be especially high, and the likelihood of\nmisuse, especially low. Congress therefore took care to\nauthorize broad access to DMV information for uses these\nexceptions allow. I would read §2721(b) as according\nthe States ample leeway to use and authorize use of their\nown DMV information in these areas of traditional state\nauthority.\n   Second, the Court’s holding is hard to grasp and will be\ndifficult to apply. The Court first suggests that “[t]he\nproper solution is to draw the line at solicitation itself,” to\n“exclud[e] [solicitation] from the activity permitted in\n(b)(4).” Ante, at 21. Backing away from this clear, if\nerroneous, solution, the Court settles on an inquiry into\n“whether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal\ninformation . . . had the predominant purpose to solicit.”\nAnte, at 22. The Court’s cryptic discussion of its “predom-\n——————\n 8 See   49 U. S. C. §31308.\n16                     MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ninant purpose” test inspires little confidence. See ibid.\n(the purpose “might be evident from the communication\nitself,” but “[c]lose cases may arise”). In truth, however,\nthe line between a lawyer’s function as an officer of the\ncourt and her notice to, and solicitation of, new clients\nmay be indistinct. See infra, at 17, n. 10.\n   Consider an attorney whose client has been the victim of\na hit-and-run. The victim recalls the license plate of\nanother car at the scene, which was also hit by the offend-\ning driver. In order to investigate her client’s case, and to\nensure that “there is a supportable theory for a com-\nplaint,” ante, at 14, a responsible attorney would contact\nthis second victim, who may be able to provide useful\ninformation about the incident. But the second victim is\nalso a potential plaintiff in her own right. A communica-\ntion might therefore be viewed by the state bar as falling\nwithin the rules for solicitation. See S. C. Rule of Profes-\nsional Conduct 7.3(d) (2012) (solicitation rule applies to\ncommunications between an attorney and “a prospective\nclient known to be in need of legal services in a particular\nmatter”).9 Under today’s decision, the attorney will be in\nan impossible position. Her duties to her client—and to\nthe court to conduct a reasonable investigation before\nfiling a lawsuit—instruct her to contact the potential\nwitness. To avoid running afoul of the state bar’s rules,\nhowever, she may need to label any communication with\nthe witness as a solicitation. But if she does that, today’s\nruling would expose her to liability under the DPPA.\n   This example is not so far removed from the facts of this\ncase. Petitioners conceded, both in their briefs and at oral\nargument, that the DPPA would have permitted respond-\nents to contact the purchasers of cars to ask them whether\n——————\n  9 Beyond debate, the solicitation here was permissible under South\n\nCarolina’s ethics rules. Petitioners do not argue otherwise. The Court\nconsiders this a “relevant,” but not “dispositive” factor. Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Indeed, such an investigation was criti-\ncal to pursuit and resolution of the Herron litigation. See\nsupra, at 5. But in this case, as in the hypothetical case\njust posed, investigating the facts involved contacting\npeople who might potentially become parties. And profes-\nsional rules regarding solicitation may well apply to such\ncommunications.\n   Reality thus belies the Court’s pretense that a bright\nline separates solicitation from other aspects of a lawyer’s\nrole as officer of the court. Perhaps aware that, in many\ncases, the line will be hazy or hard to find, the Court\nresorts to inapposite comparisons. The Court notes, for\nexample, that it would be impermissible for a lawyer to\nuse information obtained from the DMV to send out adver-\ntisements for “a book he wrote.” Ante, at 24. But no one\nwould confuse bookselling with investigation in anticipa-\ntion of litigation; such a use would be impermissible under\nany reading of (b)(4).\n   The Court’s disposition will require lower courts to\nparse whether every communication using DMV infor-\nmation in the course of litigation has solicitation as a\n“predominant purpose.” Ante, at 22. The holding in Mar-\nacich’s case, I fear, will, at a minimum, impede the effi-\ncient administration of state-court litigation and may well\nprove infeasible.10 Cf. United States v.

As the Court of Appeals recog-\nnized, the use here, although qualifying as a solicitation,\n“was inextricably intertwined with investigation and\nprosecution of the Herron litigation.” 675 F. 3d, at 300.\n   Finally, the rule of lenity requires that we resolve any\nresidual ambiguity in respondents’ favor. Petitioners\nsought $2,500 in statutory damages for every letter\nmailed—a total of some $200 million—and punitive dam-\nages to boot. Brief for Respondents 15. Such damages\ncannot possibly represent a legislative judgment regarding\naverage actual damage. The Court’s opinion is wrong to\nsuggest that the rule of lenity does not apply to govern-\nmental penalties so long as they are payable to private\nindividuals and labeled “liquidated damages,” rather than\n“criminal fines.” Moreover, the DPPA, which appears in\nTitle 18 of the United States Code, imposes criminal liabil-\nity for a knowing violation of its provisions. 18 U. S. C.\n§2723(a). Because this is a civil case, I need not consider\nwhat defenses respondent-lawyers might have were they\ncriminally prosecuted. But because we are interpreting a\ncriminal statute, “it is appropriate to apply the rule of\nlenity in resolving any ambiguity in the ambit of the stat-\nute’s coverage,” even in a civil case. Crandon v. United\nStates, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). See also Leocal v. Ash-\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12, n. 8 (2004) (explaining that, if a\nstatute has criminal applications, “the rule of lenity ap-\nplies” to the Court’s interpretation of the statute\n“[b]ecause we must interpret the statute consistently,\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But it finds any\nambiguity in these phrases resolved by the structure of\nthe DPPA. Ibid. What “structure,” one may ask, other\nthan an enumeration of 14 discrete exceptions, each per-\nmitting disclosure? See supra, at 11–12. The DPPA has\nbeen in effect for over 15 years, and yet the Court points to\nno judicial decision interpreting the statute in the way it\ndoes today. We should hesitate to adopt a novel interpre-\ntation of a federal statute that subjects parties to crushing\nliability. “[I]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be\ngiven to the world in language that the common world will\nunderstand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line\nis passed.” McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27\n(1931) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.). Respondent-\nlawyers were given no such fair warning.\n                            IV\n  The Court today exposes lawyers whose conduct meets\nstate ethical requirements to huge civil liability and po-\ntential criminal liability. It does so by adding to the\nDPPA’s litigation exception a solicitation bar Congress did\nnot place in that exception.

Argued January 9, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nRespondent attorneys submitted several state Freedom of Information\n  Act (FOIA) requests to the South Carolina DMV, seeking names and\n  addresses of thousands of individuals in order to solicit clients for a\n  lawsuit they had pending against several South Carolina car dealer-\n  ships for violation of a state law that protects car purchasers from\n  dealership actions that are “arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconsciona-\n  ble.” Using the personal information provided by the DMV, respond-\n  ents sent over 34,000 car purchasers letters, which were headed\n  “ADVERTISING MATERIAL,” explained the lawsuit, and asked re-\n  cipients to return an enclosed reply card if they wanted to participate\n  in the case. Petitioners, South Carolina residents, sued respondents\n  for violating the federal Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994\n  (DPPA) by obtaining, disclosing, and using petitioners’ personal in-\n  formation from motor vehicle records for bulk solicitation without\n  their express consent. Respondents moved to dismiss, claiming that\n  the information was properly released under a DPPA exception per-\n  mitting disclosure of personal information “for use in connection with\n  any civil, criminal, administrative, or arbitral proceeding,” including\n  “investigation in anticipation of litigation.” 18 U. S. C. §2721(b)(4).\n  The District Court held that respondents’ letters were not solicita-\n  tions and that the use of information fell within (b)(4)’s litigation ex-\n  ception. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the letters\n  were solicitation, but that the solicitation was intertwined with con-\n  duct that satisfied the (b)(4) exception.\nHeld: An attorney’s solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose\n covered by the (b)(4) litigation exception. Pp. 6–29.\n    (a) State DMVs generally require someone seeking a driver’s li-\n cense or registering a vehicle to disclose detailed personal infor-\n2                          MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                                    Syllabus\n\n    mation such as name, address, telephone number, Social Security\n    number, and medical information. The DPPA—responding to a\n    threat from stalkers and criminals who could acquire state DMV in-\n    formation, and concerns over the States’ common practice of selling\n    such information to direct marketing and solicitation businesses—\n    bans disclosure, absent a driver’s consent, of “personal information,”\n    e.g., names, addresses, or telephone numbers, as well as “highly re-\n    stricted personal information,” e.g., photographs, social security\n    numbers, and medical or disability information, §2725(4), unless 1 of\n    14 exemptions applies. Subsection (b)(4) permits disclosure of both\n    personal information and highly restricted personal information,\n    while subsection (b)(12) permits disclosure only of personal infor-\n    mation. Pp. 6–8.\n        (b) Respondents’ solicitation of prospective clients is neither a use\n    “in connection with” litigation nor “investigation in anticipation of lit-\n    igation” under (b)(4). Pp. 8–15.\n           (1) The phrase “in connection with” provides little guidance with-\n    out a limiting principle consistent with the DPPA’s purpose and its\n    other provisions. See New York State Conference of Blue Cross &\n    Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 656. Such a\n    consistent interpretation is also required because (b)(4) is an excep-\n    tion to both the DPPA’s general ban on disclosure of “personal infor-\n    mation” and the ban on release of “highly restricted personal infor-\n    mation.” An exception to a general policy statement is “usually read\n    . . . narrowly in order to preserve the [provision’s] primary operation.”\n    Commissioner v. Clark, 489 U. S. 726, 739. Reading (b)(4) to permit\n    disclosure of personal information when there is any connection be-\n    tween protected information and a potential legal dispute would sub-\n    stantially undermine the DPPA’s purpose of protecting a right to pri-\n    vacy in motor vehicle records. Subsection (b)(4)’s “in connection with”\n    language must have a limit, and a logical and necessary conclusion is\n    that an attorney’s solicitation of prospective clients falls outside of\n    that limit. Pp. 9–11.\n           (2) An attorney’s solicitation of new clients is distinct from an at-\n    torney’s conduct on behalf of his client or the court. Solicitation “by a\n    lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction,”\n    Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 457, and state bars\n    treat solicitation as discrete professional conduct. Excluding solicita-\n    tion from the meaning of “in connection with” litigation draws sup-\n    port from (b)(4)’s examples of permissible litigation uses—“service of\n    process, investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execution\n    or enforcement of judgments and orders”—which all involve an attor-\n    ney’s conduct as an officer of the court, not a commercial actor. Simi-\n    larly, “investigation in anticipation of litigation” is best understood to\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nallow background research to determine if there is a supportable the-\nory for a complaint or a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing\na frivolous lawsuit, or to help locate witnesses for deposition or trial.\nPp. 11–14.\n      (3) This reading is also supported by the fact that (b)(4) allows\nuse of the most sensitive personal information. Permitting its use in\nsolicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it must not be\nassumed, without clear and explicit language, absent here, that Con-\ngress intended to exempt attorneys from DPPA liability in this re-\ngard. Pp. 14–15.\n   (c) Limiting (b)(4)’s reach also respects the statutory purpose and\ndesign evident in subsection (b)(12), which allows solicitation only of\npersons who have given express consent to have their names and ad-\ndresses disclosed for this purpose. Subsection (b)(12) implements an\nimportant objective of the DPPA—to restrict disclosure of personal\ninformation in motor vehicle records to businesses for the purpose of\ndirect marketing and solicitation. Other exceptions should not be\nconstrued to interfere with this objective unless the text commands\nit. Reading (b)(4)’s “in connection with” phrase to include solicitation\nwould permit an attorney to use personal information from the state\nDMV to send bulk solicitations to prospective clients without their\nexpress consent, thus creating significant tension between the\nDPPA’s litigation and solicitation exceptions. Pp. 15–19.\n   (d) Such a reading of (b)(4) could also affect the interpretation of\nthe (b)(6) exception, which allows an insurer and certain others to ob-\ntain DMV information for use “in connection with . . . underwriting,”\nand the (b)(10) exception, which permits disclosure and use of per-\nsonal information “in connection with” the operation of private toll\nroads. Pp. 19–20.\n   (e) Respondents contend that a line can be drawn between mere\ntrolling for clients and their solicitation, which was tied to a specific\nlegal dispute, but that is not a tenable distinction. The DPPA sup-\nports drawing the line at solicitation. Solicitation can aid an attorney\nin bringing a lawsuit or increasing its size, but the question is\nwhether or not lawyers can use personal information protected under\nthe DPPA for this purpose. The mere fact that respondents complied\nwith state bar rules governing solicitations also does not resolve\nwhether they were entitled to access personal information from the\nstate DMV database for that purpose. In determining whether ob-\ntaining, using, or disclosing personal information is for the prohibited\npurpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant’s\npurpose was to solicit, which might be evident from the communica-\ntion itself or from the defendant’s course of conduct. When that is the\npredominant purpose, (b)(4) does not entitle attorneys to DPPA-\n4                         MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    protected information even when solicitation is to aggregate a class\n    action. Attorneys also have other alternatives to aggregate a class,\n    including, e.g. soliciting plaintiffs through traditional and permitted\n    advertising. And they may obtain DPPA-protected information for a\n    proper investigative use.\n       Although the Fourth Circuit held that the letters here were solici-\n    tations, it found the communications nonetheless exempt under (b)(4)\n    because they were “inextricably intertwined” with permissible litiga-\n    tion purposes. If however, the use of DPPA-protected personal in-\n    formation has the predominant purpose of solicitation, it would not\n    be protected by (b)(4). A remand is necessary for the court to apply\n    the proper standard to determine the predominant purpose of re-\n    spondents’ letters. Pp. 20–26.\n       (f) There is no work for the rule of lenity to do here, because the\n    DPPA’s text and structure resolve any ambiguity in (b)(4)’s phrases\n    “in connection with” and “investigation in anticipation of litigation.”\n    Pp. 26–27.\n       (g) On remand, the courts below must determine whether respond-\n    ents’ letters, viewed objectively, had the predominant purpose of so-\n    licitation, and may address whether respondents’ conduct was per-\n    missible under (b)(1)’s governmental-function exception and any\n    other defenses that have been properly preserved.

See 18 U. S. C. §§2721–\n2725.\n   The DPPA regulates the disclosure of personal infor-\nmation contained in the records of state motor vehicle de-\npartments (DMVs). Disclosure of personal information\nis prohibited unless for a purpose permitted by an ex-\nception listed in 1 of 14 statutory subsections. See\n§§2721(b)(1)–(14). This case involves the interpretation of\none of those exceptions, subsection (b)(4). The exception in\n(b)(4) permits obtaining personal information from a state\nDMV for use “in connection with” judicial and administra-\ntive proceedings, including “investigation in anticipation\nof litigation.” §2721(b)(4). The question presented is\nwhether an attorney’s solicitation of clients for a lawsuit\nfalls within the scope of (b)(4).\n2                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Respondents are trial lawyers licensed to practice in\nSouth Carolina. They obtained names and addresses of\nthousands of individuals from the South Carolina DMV in\norder to send letters to find plaintiffs for a lawsuit they\nhad filed against car dealers for violations of South Caro-\nlina law. Petitioners, South Carolina residents whose\ninformation was obtained and used without their consent,\nsued respondents for violating the DPPA. Respondents\nclaimed the solicitation letters were permitted under\nsubsection (b)(4). In light of the text, structure, and pur-\npose of the DPPA, the Court now holds that an attorney’s\nsolicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered\nby the (b)(4) litigation exception.\n                              I\n\n                             A\n\n   The State of South Carolina, to protect purchasers of\nmotor vehicles, enacted the South Carolina Regulation\nof Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (MDDA).\nIn June 2006, respondent attorneys were approached by\ncar purchasers who complained about administrative fees\ncharged by car dealerships in certain South Carolina\ncounties, allegedly in violation of the MDDA. The state\nstatute prohibits motor vehicle dealers from engaging in\n“any action which is arbitrary, in bad faith, or unconscion-\nable and which causes damage to any of the parties or to\nthe public.” S. C. Code Ann. §56–15–40(1) (2006). The\nMDDA provides that “one or more may sue for the benefit\nof the whole” where an action is “one of common or general\ninterest to many persons or when the parties are numer-\nous and it is impracticable to bring them all before the\ncourt.” §56–15–110(2).\n   On June 23, 2006, one of the respondent attorneys\nsubmitted a state Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\nrequest to the South Carolina DMV to determine if charg-\ning illegal administrative fees was a common practice so\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat a lawsuit could be brought as a representative action\nunder the MDDA. The attorney’s letter to the DMV re-\nquested information regarding “[p]rivate purchases of new\nor used automobiles in Spartanburg County during the\nweek of May 1–7, 2006, including the name, address, and\ntelephone number of the buyer, dealership where pur-\nchased, type of vehicle purchased, and date of purchase.”\nApp. 57. The letter explained that the request was made\n“in anticipation of litigation . . . pursuant to the exception\nin 18 USC §2721(b)(4) of the Driver’s Privacy Protection\nAct.” Ibid. The South Carolina DMV provided the re-\nquested information. On August 24, 2006, respondents\nsubmitted a second FOIA request to the DMV, also assert-\ning that it was made “in anticipation of litigation . . .\npursuant to the exception in 18 USC §2721(b)(4),” for car\npurchasers in five additional counties during the same\nweek. Id., at 67.\n  On August 29, 2006, respondents filed suit in South\nCarolina state court on behalf of four of the consumers\nwho originally contacted them. The case is referred to\nhere, and by the parties, as the Herron suit. The com-\nplaint in the Herron suit named 51 dealers as defendants\nand invoked the MDDA’s “group action” provision to assert\nclaims “for the benefit of all South Carolina car buyers\nwh[o] paid administrative fees,” id., at 128, to those deal-\ners during the same time period.\n  Some of the dealer defendants in the Herron suit filed\nmotions to dismiss for lack of standing because none of the\nnamed plaintiffs purchased cars from them. On October\n26, 2006, while the motions to dismiss were pending,\nrespondents submitted a new FOIA request to the South\nCarolina DMV. That request, again citing subsection\n(b)(4) of the DPPA, sought to locate additional car buyers\nwho could serve as plaintiffs against the dealers who had\nmoved to dismiss. On October 31, 2006, respondents filed\nan amended complaint, which added four named plaintiffs\n4                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand increased the number of defendant dealers from 51 to\n324. As before, defendant dealerships that had not en-\ngaged in transactions with any of the now eight named\nplaintiffs filed motions to dismiss for lack of standing.\n   On January 3, 2007, using the personal information\nthey had obtained from the South Carolina DMV, re-\nspondents sent a mass mailing to find car buyers to serve\nas additional plaintiffs in the litigation against the deal-\ners. Later in January, respondents made three more\nFOIA requests to the South Carolina DMV seeking per-\nsonal information concerning people who had purchased\ncars from an additional 31 dealerships, again citing the\n(b)(4) exception. The South Carolina DMV granted all the\nrequests. On January 23, respondents mailed a second\nround of letters to car buyers whose personal information\nhad been disclosed by the DMV. Respondents sent addi-\ntional rounds of letters on March 1, March 5, and May 8.\nEach of the five separate mailings was sent to different\nrecipients. In total, respondents used the information\nobtained through their FOIA requests to send letters to\nover 34,000 car purchasers in South Carolina. This opin-\nion refers to the communications sent by respondents\nsimply as the “letters.”\n   The letters, all essentially the same, had the heading\n“ADVERTISING MATERIAL.” The letters explained the\nlawsuit against the South Carolina dealers and asked\nrecipients to contact the respondent-lawyers if interested\nin participating in the case. Attached to the letter was a\nreply card that asked a few questions about the recipient’s\ncontact information and car purchase and ended with the\nsentence “I am interested in participating” followed by a\nsignature line. The text of the letter and reply are set out\nin full in the Appendix, infra.\n   In accordance with South Carolina Rule of Professional\nConduct 7.3 (2012), which regulates the solicitation of\nprospective clients, respondents filed a copy of the letter\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand a list of recipients’ names and addresses with the\nSouth Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\n  In June 2007, respondents sought to amend their com-\nplaint to add 247 plaintiffs. The court denied leave to\namend and held the named plaintiffs had standing to sue\nonly those dealerships from which they had purchased\nautomobiles and any alleged co-conspirators. In Septem-\nber 2007, respondents filed two new lawsuits on behalf of\nthe additional car buyers. Those subsequent cases were\nconsolidated with the Herron suit. All claims against\ndealerships without a corresponding plaintiff-purchaser\nwere dropped.\n                            B\n  In the case now before the Court, petitioners are South\nCarolina residents whose personal information was ob-\ntained by respondents from the South Carolina DMV and\nused without their consent to send solicitation letters\nasking them to join the lawsuits against the car dealer-\nships. Petitioner Edward Maracich received one of the\nletters in March 2007. While his personal information had\nbeen disclosed to respondents because he was one of many\nbuyers from a particular dealership, Maracich also hap-\npened to be the dealership’s director of sales and market-\ning. Petitioners Martha Weeks and John Tanner received\nletters from respondents in May 2007. In response to the\nletter, Tanner called Richard Harpootlian, one of the\nrespondent attorneys listed on the letter. According to\nTanner, Harpootlian made an aggressive sales pitch to\nsign Tanner as a client for the lawsuit without asking\nabout the circumstances of his purchase.\n  In 2009, petitioners filed the instant putative class-\naction lawsuit in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of South Carolina. The complaint alleged that\nrespondents had violated the DPPA by obtaining, disclos-\ning, and using personal information from motor vehicle\n6                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrecords for bulk solicitation without the express consent of\npetitioners and the other class members.\n   Respondents moved to dismiss. The information, they\ncontended, was subject to disclosure because it falls within\ntwo statutory exceptions in the DPPA: (b)(1), pertaining to\ngovernmental functions, and (b)(4), pertaining to litiga-\ntion. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Dis-\ntrict Court held as a matter of law that respondents’\nletters were not solicitations and that the use of information\nfell within the (b)(4) litigation exception. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 61a. The District Court also found that respondents’\nuse of personal information was permitted under the (b)(1)\ngovernmental-function exception.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.\nUnlike the District Court, it found that the letters were\n“solicitation[s]” within the meaning of the DPPA; but it\nheld further that when “solicitation is an accepted and\nexpected element of, and is inextricably intertwined with,\nconduct satisfying the litigation exception under the\nDPPA, such solicitation is not actionable.” 675 F. 3d 281,\n284 (2012). This Court granted certiorari to address\nwhether the solicitation of clients is a permissible purpose\nfor obtaining personal information from a state DMV\nunder the DPPA’s (b)(4) exception. 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                            II\n  To obtain a driver’s license or register a vehicle, state\nDMVs, as a general rule, require an individual to disclose\ndetailed personal information, including name, home\naddress, telephone number, Social Security number, and\nmedical information. See Reno v. Condon, 528 U. S. 141,\n143 (2000). The enactment of the DPPA responded to at\nleast two concerns over the personal information con-\ntained in state motor vehicle records. The first was a\ngrowing threat from stalkers and criminals who could\nacquire personal information from state DMVs. The se-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncond concern related to the States’ common practice of\nselling personal information to businesses engaged in\ndirect marketing and solicitation. To address these con-\ncerns, the DPPA “establishes a regulatory scheme that\nrestricts the States’ ability to disclose a driver’s personal\ninformation without the driver’s consent.” Id., at 144.\n   The DPPA provides that, unless one of its exceptions\napplies, a state DMV “shall not knowingly disclose or\notherwise make available” “personal information” and\n“highly restricted personal information.” §§2721(a)(1)–(2).\n“[P]ersonal information” is “information that identifies an\nindividual, including [a] . . . driver identification number,\nname, address . . . , [or] telephone number, . . . but does\nnot include information on vehicular accidents, driving\nviolations, and driver’s status.” §2725(3). “[H]ighly re-\nstricted personal information” is defined as “an individu-\nal’s photograph or image, social security number, [and]\nmedical or disability information.” §2725(4). The DPPA\nmakes it unlawful “for any person knowingly to obtain or\ndisclose personal information, from a motor vehicle record,\nfor any use not permitted under section 2721(b) of this\ntitle.” §2722(a). A person “who knowingly obtains, dis-\ncloses or uses personal information, from a motor vehicle\nrecord, for a purpose not permitted under this chapter\nshall be liable to the individual to whom the information\npertains.” §2724(a).\n   The DPPA’s disclosure ban is subject to 14 exceptions\nset forth in §2721(b), for which personal information “may\nbe disclosed.” The two exceptions most relevant for the\npurpose of this case are the litigation exception in subsec-\ntion (b)(4) and the solicitation exception in (b)(12).\n   The (b)(4) litigation exception is one of the four provi-\nsions permitting disclosure not only of personal infor-\nmation but also of highly restricted personal information.\n§2721(b)(4); §2725(4). It provides that information may be\ndisclosed:\n8                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n      “For use in connection with any civil, criminal, ad-\n    ministrative, or arbitral proceeding in any Federal,\n    State, or local court or agency or before any self-\n    regulatory body, including the service of process,\n    investigation in anticipation of litigation, and the exe-\n    cution or enforcement of judgments and orders, or pur-\n    suant to an order of a Federal, State, or local court.”\n  The (b)(12) solicitation exception provides that certain\npersonal information, not including highly restricted\npersonal information, may be disclosed:\n       “For bulk distribution for surveys, marketing, or so-\n    licitations if the State has obtained the express con-\n    sent of the person to whom such personal information\n    pertains.”\nThe solicitation exception was originally enacted as an\nopt-out provision, allowing state DMVs to disclose personal\ninformation for purposes of solicitation only if the DMV\ngave individuals an opportunity to prohibit such disclo-\nsures. §2721(b)(12) (1994 ed.). In 1999, Congress changed\nto an opt-in regime, requiring a driver’s affirmative con-\nsent before solicitations could be sent. See Condon, supra,\nat 144–145.\n                             III\n  Respondents’ liability depends on whether their use of\npersonal information acquired from the South Carolina\nDMV to solicit clients constitutes a permissible purpose\nunder the DPPA. The District Court held that respond-\nents’ conduct was permissible both under the (b)(1) and\n(b)(4) exceptions. The Court of Appeals ruled that the\nconduct here was permissible under (b)(4); but, unlike the\nDistrict Court, it did not address the alternative argument\nthat the conduct was also permissible under (b)(1). As in\nthe Court of Appeals, only the (b)(4) exception is discussed\nhere.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              A\n\n   Respondents claim they were entitled to obtain and use\npetitioners’ personal information based on two of the\nphrases in (b)(4). First, disclosure of personal information\nis permitted for use “in connection with any civil, criminal,\nadministrative, or arbitral proceeding.”         §2721(b)(4).\nSecond, a use in connection with litigation includes “inves-\ntigation in anticipation of litigation.” Ibid. Respondents\ncontend that the solicitation of prospective clients, espe-\ncially in the circumstances of this case, is both a use “in\nconnection with” litigation and “investigation in anticipa-\ntion of litigation.”\n                               1\n   If considered in isolation, and without reference to the\nstructure and purpose of the DPPA, (b)(4)’s exception\nallowing disclosure of personal information “for use in\nconnection with any civil, criminal, administrative, or\narbitral proceeding,” and for “investigation in anticipation\nof litigation,” is susceptible to a broad interpretation.\nThat language, in literal terms, could be interpreted to its\nbroadest reach to include the personal information that\nrespondents obtained here. But if no limits are placed on\nthe text of the exception, then all uses of personal infor-\nmation with a remote relation to litigation would be ex-\nempt under (b)(4). The phrase “in connection with” is\nessentially “indeterminat[e]” because connections, like\nrelations, “ ‘stop nowhere.’ ” New York State Conference of\nBlue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514\nU. S. 645, 655 (1995). So the phrase “in connection with”\nprovides little guidance without a limiting principle con-\nsistent with the structure of the statute and its other\nprovisions. See id., at 656 (“We simply must go beyond\nthe unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining\n[‘connection with’], and look instead to the objectives of the\nERISA statute”); see also California Div. of Labor Stand­\n10                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519\nU. S. 316, 335 (1997) (“But applying the ‘relate to’ provi-\nsion according to its terms was a project doomed to failure,\nsince, as many a curbstone philosopher has observed,\neverything is related to everything else”).\n   An interpretation of (b)(4) that is consistent with the\nstatutory framework and design is also required because\n(b)(4) is an exception to both the DPPA’s general prohibi-\ntion against disclosure of “personal information” and its\nban on release of “highly restricted personal information.”\n§§2721(a)(1)–(2). An exception to a “general statement of\npolicy” is “usually read . . . narrowly in order to preserve\nthe primary operation of the provision.” Commissioner v.\nClark, 489 U. S. 726, 739 (1989). It is true that the\nDPPA’s 14 exceptions permit disclosure of personal infor-\nmation in a range of circumstances. Unless commanded\nby the text, however, these exceptions ought not operate to\nthe farthest reach of their linguistic possibilities if that\nresult would contravene the statutory design. Cf. Cowan\nv. Ernest Codelia, P. C., 149 F. Supp. 2d 67 (SDNY 2001)\n(rejecting an argument by defense counsel that obtaining\nfrom the DMV the home address of the assistant district\nattorney to send her a harassing letter was a permissible\nuse “in connection with” the ongoing criminal proceeding\nunder (b)(4)).\n   If (b)(4) were read to permit disclosure of personal in-\nformation whenever any connection between the protected\ninformation and a potential legal dispute could be shown,\nit would undermine in a substantial way the DPPA’s\npurpose of protecting an individual’s right to privacy in his\nor her motor vehicle records. The “in connection with”\nlanguage in (b)(4) must have a limit. A logical and neces-\nsary conclusion is that an attorney’s solicitation of pro-\nspective clients falls outside of that limit.\n   The proposition that solicitation is a distinct form of\nconduct, separate from the conduct in connection with\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nlitigation permitted under (b)(4) is demonstrated: by the\nwords of the statute itself; by formal rules issued by bar\norganizations and governing boards; and by state statutes\nand regulations that govern and direct attorneys with\nreference to their duties in litigation, to their clients, and\nto the public. As this opinion explains in more detail, the\nstatute itself, in (b)(12), treats bulk solicitation absent\nconsent as a discrete act that the statute prohibits. And\nthe limited examples of permissible litigation purposes\nprovided in (b)(4) are distinct from the ordinary commer-\ncial purpose of solicitation. Canons of ethics used by bar\nassociations treat solicitation as a discrete act, an act\nsubject to specific regulation. And state statutes, includ-\ning statutes of the State of South Carolina, treat solicita-\ntion as a discrete subject for regulation and governance of\nthe profession. It would contradict the idea that solicita-\ntion is defined conduct apart from litigation to treat it as\nsimply another aspect of the litigation duties set out in\n(b)(4).\n                               2\n   An attorney’s solicitation of new clients is distinct from\nother aspects of the legal profession. “It is no less true\nthan trite that lawyers must operate in a three-fold capac-\nity, as self-employed businessmen as it were, as trusted\nagents of their clients, and as assistants to the court in\nsearch of a just solution to disputes.” Cohen v. Hurley, 366\nU. S. 117, 124 (1961), overruled on other grounds, Spevack\nv. Klein, 385 U. S. 511 (1967). Unlike an attorney’s\nconduct performed on behalf of his client or the court,\n“solicitation by a lawyer of remunerative employment is a\nbusiness transaction.” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436\nU. S. 447, 457 (1978); see also Zauderer v. Office of Disci­\nplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626,\n637 (1985) (attorney solicitation “ ‘propose[s] a commercial\ntransaction’ ”). The “pecuniary motivation of the lawyer\n12                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwho solicits a particular representation” may even “create\nspecial problems of conflict of interest.” Ohralik, supra, at\n461, n. 19.\n   The distinction between solicitation and an attorney’s\nother duties is also recognized and regulated by state bars\nor their governing bodies, which treat solicitation as dis-\ncrete professional conduct. See, e.g., Cal. Rule Prof. Con-\nduct 1–400 (2013); N. Y. Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3 (2012–\n2013); Tex. Disciplinary Rules Prof. Conduct 7.02–7.03\n(2013); Va. Rule Prof. Conduct 7.3 (Supp. 2012). That,\nindeed, was true here. Respondents were required by the\nSouth Carolina rules of ethics to include certain language\nin their solicitation letters and to file copies with the\nSouth Carolina Office of Disciplinary Counsel. See S. C.\nRule Prof. Conduct 7.3. Given the difference between an\nattorney’s commercial solicitation of clients and his duties\nas an officer of the court, the proper reading of (b)(4) is\nthat solicitation falls outside of the litigation exception.\nAnd when (b)(4) is interpreted not to give attorneys the\nprivilege of using protected personal information to pro-\npose a commercial transaction, the statute is limited by\nterms and categories that have meaning in the regular\ncourse of professional practice.\n   The exclusion of solicitation from the meaning of “in\nconnection with” litigation draws further support from the\nexamples of permissible litigation uses in (b)(4). The\nfamiliar canon of noscitur a sociis, the interpretive rule\nthat “words and people are known by their companions,”\nGutierrez v. Ada, 528 U. S. 250, 255 (2000), provides in-\nstruction in this respect. Under this rule, the phrases “in\nconnection with” and “investigation in anticipation of\nlitigation,” which are “capable of many meanings,” Jarecki\nv. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961), can be\nconstrued in light of their accompanying words in order to\navoid giving the statutory exception “unintended breadth,”\nibid.; see also United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n294 (2008) (the canon of noscitur a sociis “counsels that a\nword is given more precise content by the neighboring\nwords with which it is associated”).\n   The examples of uses “in connection with” litigation that\nCongress provided in (b)(4) include “the service of process,\ninvestigation in anticipation of litigation, and the execu-\ntion or enforcement of judgments and orders, or pursuant\nto an order of a Federal, State, or local court.” §2721(b)(4).\nThese uses involve an attorney’s conduct when acting in\nthe capacity as an officer of the court, not as a commercial\nactor. The listed examples are steps that ensure the\nintegrity and efficiency of an existing or imminent legal\nproceeding. This may include contacting persons who are\nalready involved in the litigation or who are necessary\nparties or witnesses. These steps are different from the\nordinary business purpose of solicitation. Here, as will be\nthe case for most solicitations, the attorneys acted without\ncourt authorization or supervision and cast a wide net,\nsending letters to over 30,000 car purchasers to let them\nknow the attorneys’ names and the attorneys’ interest in\nperforming legal services for them.\n   The examples in (b)(4) confirm, and are all consistent\nwith, protecting the professional responsibilities that\ncounsel, or the court, must discharge in the proper conduct\nof litigation. These are quite distinct from the separate\nsubject, the separate professional conduct, of soliciting\nclients. The examples suggest that the litigation exception\nhas a limited scope to permit the use of highly restricted\npersonal information when it serves an integral purpose in\na particular legal proceeding. In light of the types of\nconduct permitted by the subsection, the “in connection\nwith” language should not be read to include commercial\nsolicitations by an attorney.\n   Similarly, “investigation in anticipation of litigation” is\nbest understood to allow background research to deter-\nmine whether there is a supportable theory for a com-\n14                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nplaint, a theory sufficient to avoid sanctions for filing a\nfrivolous lawsuit, or to locate witnesses for deposition or\ntrial testimony. An interpretation of “investigation” to\ninclude commercial solicitation of new clients would ex-\npand the language in a way inconsistent with the limited\nuses given as examples in the statutory text. It must be\nnoted also that the phrase “in anticipation of litigation” is\nnot a standalone phrase. It modifies, and necessarily\nnarrows, the word “investigation.” To use the phrase “in\nanticipation of litigation” without that qualification is to\nextend the meaning of the statute far beyond its text.\n                                3\n  An additional reason to hold that (b)(4) does not permit\nsolicitation of clients is because the exception allows use of\nthe most sensitive kind of information, including medical\nand disability history and Social Security numbers. To\npermit this highly personal information to be used in\nsolicitation is so substantial an intrusion on privacy it\nmust not be assumed, without language more clear and\nexplicit, that Congress intended to exempt attorneys from\nDPPA liability in this regard.\n  Subsection (b)(4) is one of only four exceptions in the\nstatute that permit disclosure of “highly restricted personal\ninformation,” including a person’s image, Social Security\nnumber, and medical and disability information. See\n§2721(a)(2); §2725(4). The other three exceptions that\npermit access to highly restricted personal information\ninclude: use by the government, including law enforce-\nment, see §2721(b)(1); use by an insurer in claim investi-\ngation and antifraud activities, see §2721(b)(6); and use by\nan employer to obtain or verify information as required by\nlaw, see §2721(b)(9). None of these exceptions are written\nto authorize private individuals to acquire the most re-\nstricted personal information in bulk merely to propose a\ncommercial transaction for their own financial benefit. If\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n(b)(4) permitted access to highly restricted personal infor-\nmation for an attorney’s own commercial ends with-\nout governmental authorization or without consent of\nthe holder of the driver’s license, the result would be so sig-\nnificant a departure from these other exceptions that\nit counsels against adopting this interpretation of the\nstatute.\n   While the (b)(4) exception allows this sensitive infor-\nmation to be used for investigation in anticipation of\nlitigation and in the litigation itself, there is no indication\nCongress wanted to provide attorneys with a special con-\ncession to obtain medical information and Social Security\nnumbers for the purpose of soliciting new business.\n                              B\n   Limiting the reach of (b)(4) to foreclose solicitation of\nclients also respects the statutory design of the DPPA.\nThe use of protected personal information for the purpose\nof bulk solicitation is addressed explicitly by the text of\n(b)(12). Congress was aware that personal information\nfrom motor vehicle records could be used for solicitation,\nand it permitted it in circumstances that it defined, with\nthe specific safeguard of consent by the person contacted.\nSo the absence of the term “solicitation” in (b)(4) is telling.\nSubsection (b)(12) allows solicitation only of those persons\nwho have given express consent to have their names and\naddresses disclosed for this purpose. If (b)(4) were to be\ninterpreted to allow solicitation without consent, then the\nstructure of the Act, and the purpose of (b)(12), would be\ncompromised to a serious degree.\n   It is necessary and required that an interpretation of a\nphrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sen-\ntence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction\nas to its meaning. United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v.\nIndependent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439,\n455 (1993) (“ ‘[I]n expounding a statute, we must not be\n16                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nguided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but\nlook to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object\nand policy’ ” (quoting United States v. Heirs of Boisdoré, 8\nHow. 113, 122 (1849))). The “in connection with” language\nof (b)(4) therefore must be construed within the context of\nthe DPPA as a whole, including its other exceptions.\n   This is not to say, as petitioners contend, that this is a\nstraightforward application of the specific (qualified solici-\ntation permission in (b)(12)) controlling the general (the\nundefined reach of “in connection with” and “investigation\nin anticipation of litigation” in (b)(4)). As between the two\nexceptions at issue here, it is not clear that one is always\nmore specific than the other. For while (b)(12) is more\nspecific with respect to solicitation, (b)(4) is more specific\nwith respect to litigation. The DPPA’s 14 permissible use\nexceptions, moreover, are not in all contexts mutually\nexclusive. The better reading is that each exception ad-\ndresses different conduct which may, on occasion, overlap.\nFor example, certain uses of personal information by a\ncourt may be exempt either under (b)(1) or (b)(4). If con-\nduct falls within the explicit or unambiguous scope of one\nexception, all other potentially applicable exceptions need\nnot be satisfied.\n   So the question is not which of the two exceptions con-\ntrols but whether respondents’ conduct falls within the\nlitigation exception at all. As to this question, petitioners\nare correct that the existence of the separate provision\ngoverning solicitation provides necessary context for defin-\ning the scope of (b)(4). As discussed above, the text of\n(b)(4) indicates that the exception is best read not to in-\nclude solicitation as a use “in connection with” litigation.\nBut even if there were any doubt on this point, the statu-\ntory design of the DPPA as a whole, including the (b)(12)\nexception governing solicitations, provides additional\ninstruction for construing this provision. For this reason,\nit is relevant that “ ‘Congress has enacted a comprehensive\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscheme and has deliberately targeted specific problems\nwith specific solutions.’ ” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v.\nAmalgamated Bank, 566 U. S.___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,\nat 5).\n   Subsection (b)(12) implements an important objective of\nthe DPPA—to restrict disclosure of personal information\ncontained in motor vehicle records to businesses for the\npurpose of direct marketing and solicitation. The DPPA\nwas enacted in part to respond to the States’ common\npractice of selling personal information to businesses that\nused it for marketing and solicitations. See Condon, 528\nU. S., at 143 (“Congress found that many States . . . sell\nthis personal information to individuals and businesses”);\nid., at 148 (“The motor vehicle information which the\nStates have historically sold is used by insurers, manufac-\nturers, direct marketers, and others engaged in interstate\ncommerce to contact drivers with customized solicita-\ntions”). Congress chose to protect individual privacy by\nrequiring a state DMV to obtain the license holder’s ex-\npress consent before permitting the disclosure, acquisition,\nand use of personal information for bulk solicitation. The\nimportance of the consent requirement is highlighted by\nCongress’ decision in 1999 to change the statutory mecha-\nnism that allowed individuals protected by the Act to opt\nout to one requiring them to opt in. See id., at 144–145;\nsee also §§350(c)–(e), 113 Stat. 1025.\n   Direct marketing and solicitation present a particular\nconcern not only because these activities are of the ordi-\nnary commercial sort but also because contacting an indi-\nvidual is an affront to privacy even beyond the fact that a\nlarge number of persons have access to the personal in-\nformation. The DPPA’s (b)(5) exception illustrates this\nconcern by permitting disclosure of personal information\nfor use in research activities “so long as the personal\ninformation is not published, redisclosed, or used to con-\ntact individuals.” §2721(b)(5).\n18                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Because (b)(12) represents Congress’ decision to target\nthe problem of bulk solicitation with the requirement of\nexpress consent, other exceptions should not be construed\nto interfere with this statutory mechanism unless the text\ncommands it. This is not to suggest that (b)(12) is an\noverriding rule that controls all other exceptions. It would\nnot be necessary to consider (b)(12) if another statutory\nexception applied to the relevant conduct. The relevance\nof (b)(12), however, is that it can be used as additional\nevidence of the DPPA’s statutory design to interpret ex-\nceptions whose breadth and application are uncertain.\n   Here, the phrase “in connection with” litigation in the\n(b)(4) exception, as a matter of normal usage and common\nunderstanding, does not encompass an attorney’s commer-\ncial use of DPPA-protected personal information to solicit\nnew clients. This and the other reasons given above lead\nto the conclusion that it would be incorrect to interpret the\ntext of this exception to include an attorney’s commercial\nsolicitation as a use “in connection with” litigation. And,\nunlike (b)(12), the (b)(4) exception does not require obtain-\ning an individual’s express consent before disclosing and\nusing personal information contained in state motor vehi-\ncle records. If the “in connection with” language of (b)(4)\nwere read broadly to include solicitation, an attorney could\nacquire personal information from the state DMV to send\nbulk solicitations to prospective clients without their\nexpress consent. This would create significant tension in\nthe DPPA between the litigation and solicitation excep-\ntions. That inconsistency and the concomitant undermin-\ning of the statutory design are avoided by interpreting\n(b)(4) so it does not authorize the use of personal infor-\nmation for the purpose of soliciting clients. See A. Scalia\n& B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal\nTexts 180 (2012) (“The provisions of a text should be in-\nterpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not\ncontradictory. . . . [T]here can be no justification for need-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlessly rendering provisions in conflict if they can be inter-\npreted harmoniously”).\n                              C\n   If the phrase “in connection with” in (b)(4) included\nsolicitation by lawyers, then a similar reach for that\nphrase could apply to other exceptions, resulting in fur-\nther frustration of the Act’s design. Subsection (b)(6)\nallows an insurer and certain other parties to obtain DMV\ninformation for use “in connection with . . . underwriting.”\n§2721(b)(6). If that phrase extended to solicitation, then\npersonal information protected by the DPPA could be used\nto solicit new customers for underwriting without their\nconsent. It is most doubtful that Congress intended to\nexempt insurers from the consent requirement for bulk\nsolicitations.\n   The DPPA, in subsection (b)(10), permits disclosure and\nuse of personal information “in connection with” the oper-\nation of private toll roads. If the phrase were interpreted\nto extend to all solicitations without consent, then the\nowner of a private toll road could send targeted mass\nadvertisings or direct marketing letters by using the\nprotected personal information obtained from state motor\nvehicle records. This, too, would take away much of the\nforce and effect of the (b)(12) restriction on bulk solicita-\ntion without the express consent of the person contacted.\n   When Congress did intend the phrase “in connection\nwith” to permit conduct otherwise subject to the express\nconsent requirement in (b)(12), it did so in explicit terms.\nAn illustration can be found in the interplay between\n(b)(2) and (b)(12) of the DPPA. As has been noted, (b)(12)\nprohibits disclosure of protected personal information for\nthe purpose of sending bulk distribution of surveys with-\nout the express consent of the recipients. Subsection\n(b)(2), however, permits disclosure of personal information\n“[f]or use in connection with matters of . . . motor vehicle\n20                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarket research activities, including survey research.”\n§2721(b)(2). So what the DPPA prohibits in (b)(12) it\nexplicitly allows in (b)(2), but it does so by repeating the\nsame word, “survey,” in the text of both provisions. If the\n“in connection with” language alone were sufficient to\ninclude “surveys” within (b)(2), the phrase “survey re-\nsearch” would be mere surplusage. Instead, the explicit\nreference to “survey” in (b)(2) was necessary to make clear\nthat Congress had created an exception to the (b)(12)’s\nconsent requirement for one particular type of survey.\nWhen it comes to the prohibition on “solicitations” in\n(b)(12), however, that word is not repeated in the text of\n(b)(4). This leads to the inference that Congress did not\nintend (b)(4) to include “solicitations” and thus to override\nthe express consent requirement of (b)(12).\n                               IV \n\n                                A\n\n   Respondents concede that (b)(4) does not permit attor-\nneys to use personal information acquired from a state\nDMV to find new business in the absence of any connec-\ntion to a particular transaction, occurrence, or defect.\nThey contend, however, that a line can be drawn between\nmere trolling for clients (which is not permitted) and\nsolicitation tied to a specific legal dispute (which, respond-\nents argue, is permitted). While some solicitations may\nhave a close relationship with existing proceedings, there\nis no principled way to classify some solicitations as ac-\nceptable and others as unacceptable for the purpose of\n(b)(4). Even if solicitation were permitted only after a\nlawyer has a client or filed a lawsuit, attorneys would be\nable to circumvent this limitation with ease by the simple\ndevice of filing a placeholder lawsuit. All an attorney\nwould need is one friend or family member as his client\nbefore being able to gain access to DPPA-protected per-\nsonal information to solicit persons to fill in as plaintiffs.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitation of new plaintiffs to keep defendants in a law-\nsuit that would otherwise be dismissed for lack of standing\nis no different in substance from solicitation to initiate a\nlawsuit. Here, at any rate, the state court found that\nplaintiffs had standing to sue the dealerships from which\nthey had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-\nconspirators. See 675 F. 3d, at 287, n. 3. This can under-\nmine the argument that solicitation of additional plaintiffs\nwas somehow necessary for the lawsuit to continue.\n   Drawing the line between solicitations related to an\nexisting proceeding and those that are not is not a tenable\ndistinction. The proper solution is to draw the line at\nsolicitation itself. The structure of the DPPA supports\nthis distinction. If solicitation were deemed a permissible\npurpose under (b)(4), even when limited to a particular\nlawsuit, tension would remain between the (b)(12) solicita-\ntion exception, which requires express consent, and the\n(b)(4) litigation exception, which does not. The two statu-\ntory provisions are consistent if solicitation is excluded\nfrom the activity permitted in (b)(4).\n   Of course solicitation can aid an attorney in bringing a\nlawsuit or in increasing its size. The question, however, is\nwhether or not lawyers can use personal information\nprotected under the DPPA for this purpose. Petitioners\nand other state residents have no real choice but to dis-\nclose their personal information to the state DMV, includ-\ning highly restricted personal information. The use of that\ninformation by private actors to send direct commercial\nsolicitations without the license holder’s consent is a\nsubstantial intrusion on the individual privacy the Act\nprotects. For the reasons already discussed, a proper\ninterpretation of a use “in connection with” litigation under\n(b)(4) in light of the DPPA’s text and structure does not\ninclude solicitation.\n   The fact that an attorney complies with state bar rules\ngoverning solicitations also does not resolve whether he is\n22                 MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentitled to access the state DMV database for that purpose\nunder the DPPA. There is no provision of South Carolina\nlaw that either permits or requires attorneys to use DPPA-\nprotected information to solicit potential clients. Even if\nsuch a provision existed, under the Supremacy Clause, it\nwould not protect respondents from DPPA liability unless\ntheir conduct fell within one of the Act’s exceptions.\n   A person is liable under the DPPA if he “knowingly\nobtains, discloses or uses personal information, from a\nmotor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted” by one\nof the statutory exceptions. §2724(a). In determining\nwhether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal in-\nformation is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the\nproper inquiry is whether the defendant had the predomi-\nnant purpose to solicit. Because, in some cases, a commu-\nnication sent with DPPA-protected information may serve\nmore than one objective, a court must discern whether\nsolicitation is its predominant purpose. That purpose\nmight be evident from the communication itself. In other\ninstances the defendant’s whole course of conduct will be\nrelevant in determining whether solicitation was the\npredominant purpose of the act alleged to be wrongful.\n   Close cases may arise. Where a communication seeks to\nprovide class notice or locate a witness, for example, the\nfact that the attorney provides contact information for a\nreply likely would not make the communication an im-\nproper solicitation. And the fact that a letter follows the\nstate bar rules governing attorney solicitations, although\nrelevant, will not be dispositive. For example, if the pre-\ndominant purpose of a letter was not to solicit a new cli-\nent, but rather to ask a witness investigatory questions or\nto secure her testimony at trial, adherence to state bar\nsolicitation rules would not subject the sender to DPPA\nliability. Subsequent conduct, in some cases, may show\nthat solicitation in fact was the predominant purpose of an\nearlier act; and, of course, even if an initial request was\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproper, a later use may be a violation. Where a reason-\nable observer could discern that the predominant purpose\nof obtaining, using, or disclosing protected personal\ninformation was to initiate or propose a business trans-\naction with a prospective client, (b)(4) does not exempt the\nsolicitation.\n   Respondents contend that even if solicitation of clients\nis impermissible as a general rule, solicitation to aggre-\ngate a class action suit is permitted under (b)(4). Where\nthe predominant purpose is solicitation, however, (b)(4)\ndoes not entitle attorneys to obtain and use DPPA-\nprotected information. To the extent the solicitation of\nplaintiffs can help attorneys bring a larger class action,\nthere are alternatives that do not sacrifice an individual’s\nprivacy in his or her motor vehicle records. An attorney,\npursuant to a court order, could send class notice. Class\nnotice may prompt a class member to join the lawsuit, but\nit also serves the important purpose of protecting the\nrights of absent class members and ensures that any\ndecision will be binding on the class. Class notice sent on\nthe instruction of the court also does not raise the same\nconcerns that attorneys are acting only in their own com-\nmercial interest. But respondents here did not obtain or\nuse the protected personal information to send class no-\ntices or comply with a court order. The letters made no\nmention of ethical obligations to outstanding group mem-\nbers or the consequences of not joining the suit. As the\nCourt of Appeals noted, respondents “failed to indicate to\nrecipients that they may already be de facto clients of the\nLawyers, that is, persons whose interests were already\nprotected by the senders.” 675 F. 3d, at 293. Had re-\nspondents received a court order, they might have been\nable to rely on the explicit language in (b)(4) permitting\nuses of information “pursuant to an order of a Federal,\nState, or local court.” §2721(b)(4). But because respond-\nents had no court order authorizing their conduct, this\n24                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nopinion need not address whether it would be proper for a\ncourt to order attorneys to obtain DPPA-protected personal\ninformation to solicit plaintiffs.\n   Attorneys are free to solicit plaintiffs through traditional\nand permitted advertising without obtaining personal\ninformation from a state DMV. Here, the attorneys could\nalso have complied with (b)(12) and limited their solicita-\ntion to those individuals who had expressly consented, or\nrespondents could have requested consent through the\nDPPA’s waiver procedure. See §2721(d).\n   In light of these and other alternatives, attorneys are\nnot without the necessary means to aggregate a class of\nplaintiffs. What they may not do, however, is to acquire\nhighly restricted personal information from state DMV\nrecords to send bulk solicitations without express consent\nfrom the targeted recipients.\n   This is not to suggest that attorneys may not obtain\nDPPA-protected personal information for a proper investi-\ngatory purpose. Where respondents obtained petitioners’\npersonal information to discern the extent of the alleged\nmisconduct or identify particular defendants, those FOIA\nrequests appear permissible under (b)(4) as “investigation\nin anticipation of litigation.” Solicitation of new business,\nhowever, is not “investigation” within the meaning of\n(b)(4). And acquiring petitioners’ personal information for\na legitimate investigatory purpose does not entitle re-\nspondents to then use that same information to send\ndirect solicitations. Each distinct disclosure or use of\npersonal information acquired from a state DMV must be\npermitted by the DPPA. See §2724(a) (“A person who\nknowingly obtains, discloses or uses personal information,\nfrom a motor vehicle record, for a purpose not permitted\nunder this chapter shall be liable to the individual to\nwhom the information pertains”); see also §2721(c). If the\nstatute were to operate otherwise, obtaining personal\ninformation for one permissible use would entitle attor-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           25\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nneys to use that same information at a later date for any\nother purpose. For example, a lawyer could obtain per-\nsonal information to locate witnesses for a lawsuit and\nthen use those same names and addresses later to send\ndirect marketing letters about a book he wrote.\n                              B\n   The Court of Appeals held that the letters here were\nsolicitations, finding that “a reasonable recipient would\nalmost certainly have understood the message to be a\nsolicitation from a lawyer.” Id., at 293. The court noted\nas relevant that respondents themselves took steps to\nfollow South Carolina bar rules governing attorney solici-\ntations and rejected respondents’ description of the letters\nas investigatory in nature, given that “[n]o mention was\nmade of an investigation into certain practices other than\nthe implicit suggestion of investigation during a ‘free\nconsultation.’ ” Ibid. The included reply card did not alter\nthe Court of Appeals’ finding that the communications\nwere solicitations rather than investigation. Only those\ninterested in joining the lawsuit were directed to fill out\nthe card and the only place to sign the card was under the\nphrase “I am interested in participating.” See Appendix,\ninfra, at 31. The card asked for data regarding vehicle\npurchases relevant to initiate the representation of the\nprospective clients.\n   But although the Court of Appeals found that the letters\nwere solicitations, it held the communications nonetheless\nexempt under (b)(4) because they were “inextricably inter-\ntwined” with permissible litigation purposes. 675 F. 3d, at\n284. As explained above, however, if the use of DPPA-\nprotected personal information has the predominant\npurpose of solicitation, that use is not protected by (b)(4).\nA remand is necessary for application of the proper stand-\nard because the Court of Appeals could conclude, in light\nof the content of the communications, taken with other\n26                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence in the record, that respondents’ letters had the\npredominant purpose to solicit clients.\n  On remand, the Court of Appeals should determine\nwhether the record shows that the communications\nsought, or were used, to develop the factual basis of the\nHerron complaint, locate witnesses, identify additional\ndefendants, or perform any other investigative function\nrelated to the litigation. Even if so, the question is whether\nsolicitation was the predominant purpose for sending the\nletters.\n                               V\n   This case does not involve the statutory section impos-\ning criminal liability, which is written in different terms\nthan the civil remedies provision. See §2723(a) (“A person\nwho knowingly violates this chapter shall be fined under\nthis title”). As to civil liability, the amount of damages\nsought in the complaint is based on the number of persons,\nover 30,000 individuals, whose personal and highly sensi-\ntive information was disclosed and who were solicited.\nWhether the civil damages provision in §2724, after a\ncareful and proper interpretation, would permit an award\nin this amount, and if so whether principles of due process\nand other doctrines that protect against excessive awards\nwould come into play, is not an issue argued or presented\nin this case.\n   In this framework, there is no work for the rule of lenity\nto do. This Court has held that “the rule of lenity only\napplies if, after considering text, structure, history, and\npurpose, there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty\nin the statute such that the Court must simply guess as\nto what Congress intended.” Barber v. Thomas, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 13) (citation and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted). But here, as discussed, the sur-\nrounding text and structure of the DPPA resolve any\nambiguity in phrases “in connection with” and “investiga-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           27\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion in anticipation of litigation” in (b)(4). Only where “the\nlanguage or history of [the statute] is uncertain” after\nlooking to “the particular statutory language, . . . the\ndesign of the statute as a whole and to its object and poli-\ncy,” does the rule of lenity serve to give further guidance.\nCrandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). “The\nrule [of lenity] comes into operation at the end of the\nprocess of construing what Congress has expressed, not at\nthe beginning as an overriding consideration of being\nlenient to wrongdoers.” See Callanan v. United States,\n364 U. S. 587, 596 (1961). There is no room for the rule of\nlenity where the text and structure of the DPPA require\nan interpretation of (b)(4) that does not reach out to in-\nclude an attorney’s solicitation of clients.\n                             VI\n   Solicitation of prospective clients is not a permissible\nuse “in connection with” litigation or “investigation in\nanticipation of litigation” under (b)(4) of the DPPA. As a\nresult, the Court of Appeals erred in granting respondents\nsummary judgment without first determining whether the\ncommunications had the predominant purpose of solicita-\ntion. And since the solicited persons did not give express\nconsent to the disclosure or use of their personal infor-\nmation for this purpose, the (b)(12) exception does not\napply.\n   On remand, the Court of Appeals, or the District Court,\nmust determine whether respondents’ letters, viewed\nobjectively, had the predominant purpose of solicitation.\nThe Court of Appeals’ finding that these letters were\nsolicitations can be the basis for the further conclusion\nthat solicitation was the predominant purpose of their\ntransmission. Because the Court of Appeals applied the\nwrong standard in finding these solicitations exempt\nunder (b)(4), however, the Court remands for application\nof the proper standard.\n28                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Further proceedings also may be required to determine\nwhether the initial act of obtaining petitioners’ personal\ninformation was permitted under the DPPA. The Court of\nAppeals and the District Court seem to have agreed that\nthe first two FOIA requests were made in order for re-\nspondents to decide whether to file the MDDA lawsuit as a\ngroup action and to identify the highest volume dealers.\nApp. 39a. If, in light of this opinion, the courts on remand\nadhere to the determination that the first two FOIA\nrequests were exempt under (b)(4), the later uses and dis-\nclosures of that information, nevertheless, may be independ-\nent violations of the DPPA.\n   If the use of petitioners’ personal information to send\nthe letters in this case is deemed to be a violation of the\nAct, then the courts can decide if it remains relevant and\nnecessary, for liability and damages purposes, to deter-\nmine whether the last four FOIA requests were also in\nviolation of the DPPA. Assuming violations of the DPPA\nare established, questions regarding the calculation and\nassessment of damages then can be considered.\n   Neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals has consid-\nered whether respondents’ conduct was permissible under\nthe (b)(1) governmental-function exception.          Whether\nsolicitation would be permitted conduct under (b)(1) is not\nresolved by this case. This case turns on the interpreta-\ntion of “in connection with” litigation and “investigation in\nanticipation of litigation,” phrases not included in (b)(1).\nWhere personal information is used for the predominant\npurpose of solicitation, the fact that the solicitation itself\nmay serve a governmental function is not relevant to the\ninterpretation of (b)(4). It may, however, be relevant to\nthe (b)(1) inquiry. Respondents’ argument that they were\nauthorized under state law to act as private attorneys\ngeneral on behalf of the State is properly addressed under\n(b)(1).

In connection with that litigation, the lawyers\nobtained from South Carolina’s Department of Motor\nVehicles (DMV) information identifying buyers who may\nhave been charged unlawful fees and dealers who may\nhave conspired to exact those fees. The lawyers subse-\nquently sent letters to the identified buyers inquiring\nwhether they had been charged administrative fees, in-\nforming them of the litigation, and inviting them to join as\nplaintiffs. The courts below determined that the lawyers’\nrequests for the information and their use of it fell squarely\nwithin the litigation exception to the Driver’s Privacy\nProtection Act of 1994 (DPPA), 18 U. S. C. §2721(b)(4),\nand that the Act’s limitation on solicitation, §2721(b)(12),\ndid not override the litigation exception. I would affirm\nthat sound judgment. As the Fourth Circuit explained,\nrespondents “did what any good lawyer would have done.”\n675 F. 3d 281, 298 (2012). This Court’s holding, exposing\nrespondents not only to astronomical liquidated damages,\n§2724(b)(1), but to criminal fines as well, §2723(a), is\nscarcely what Congress ordered in enacting the DPPA.\n2                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n  Respondent-lawyers obtained and used DMV infor-\nmation for “investigation in anticipation of litigation” and\nfor communications “in connection with” a civil action. I\nwould read that statutory language to permit use of DMV\ninformation tied to a specific, concrete proceeding, immi-\nnent or ongoing, with identified parties on both sides of\nthe controversy. So read, §2721(b)(4) permitted the law-\nyers’ conduct. Neither §2721(b)(12) nor any other provi-\nsion of the DPPA warrants the massive liability this\nCourt’s judgment authorizes.\n                              I\n   Public concern regarding the ability of criminals and\nstalkers to obtain information about potential victims\nprompted Congress, in 1994, to enact the DPPA. A partic-\nular spur to action was the 1989 murder of the television\nactress Rebecca Schaeffer by a fan who had obtained her\naddress from the California DMV. Taylor v. Acxiom Corp.,\n612 F. 3d 325, 336 (CA5 2010); Electronic Privacy Infor-\nmation Center, The Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA)\nand the Privacy of Your State Motor Vehicle Record,\nhttp://www.epic.org/privacy/drivers/ (as visited June 14,\n2013, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). See also\n139 Cong. Rec. 29470 (1993) (remarks of Sen. Biden).\nCongress sought to close what it saw as a loophole caused\nby state laws allowing requesters to gain access to personal\ninformation without a legitimate purpose. Addressing\nthat problem, Congress established a “regulatory scheme\nthat restricts the States’ ability to disclose a driver’s per-\nsonal information without the driver’s consent.” Ante, at 7\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The DPPA generally prohibits any state DMV from\n“knowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] available to\nany person” personal information about any individual.\n18 U. S. C. §2721(a). This prohibition is subject to a num-\nber of statutory exceptions, including stated purposes for\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The 14\npermitted uses of DMV data are designed to “strik[e] a\ncritical balance between an individual’s fundamental right\nto privacy and safety and the legitimate governmental and\nbusiness needs for th[e] information.” 140 Cong. Rec. 7925\n(1994) (remarks of Rep. Moran). State DMVs may release\ninformation for any one of these permitted purposes, but\nthey are not required to do so.\n   This case arises from a state-court lawsuit—the Herron\nlitigation—to enforce the South Carolina Regulation of\nManufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act (MDDA),\nS. C. Code Ann. §56–15–10 et seq. (2006 and Supp. 2011).\nRespondent-lawyers were approached by a number of\nrecent car purchasers who complained that they had been\ncharged unlawful fees. On behalf of the car purchasers,\nthe lawyers filed a complaint alleging that the car dealer-\nships had violated state law. The initial complaint identi-\nfied four purchasers as named plaintiffs and 51 dealers as\ndefendants; the pleading was soon amended to name eight\nplaintiffs and, as defendants, 324 dealers. 675 F. 3d, at\n285. The complaint invoked the MDDA’s representative\naction provision, which allows an individual to act as a\nprivate attorney general bringing suit “for the benefit of\nthe whole.” S. C. Code Ann. §56–15–110(2). Ultimately,\nthe Herron litigation yielded a declaratory judgment that\nthe dealers had indeed violated state law. Subsequent\nsettlements gained monetary relief for over 30,000 over-\ncharged car purchasers. The state court found that the\nHerron plaintiffs, “as private attorneys general, [had]\nrepresented the public interest in attempting to regulate\nallegedly unfair practices by motor vehicle dealers and\ntherefore represent all those affected by such practices.”\nApp. 253–254.\n   Respondent-lawyers obtained and used information\nfrom the state DMV both shortly before filing suit and\n4                   MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nduring the pendency of the state-court litigation. Before\nfiling suit, they asked the DMV for information about\nrecent car purchases in six South Carolina counties.\nThese requests explained that respondent-lawyers repre-\nsented a group of “plaintiffs who have complained of cer-\ntain conduct as a result of their transactions with car\ndealers,” and that the lawyers were “attempting to deter-\nmine if this [conduct was] a common practice.” 675 F. 3d,\nat 284 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   After the lawsuit was filed, respondent-lawyers obtained\nthe names of persons who had purchased cars from the\ndealers they had identified as defendants and mailed\nletters to those purchasers. Ante, at 4. These dispatches\nare the actions that, in the Court’s view, render respondent-\nlawyers potentially liable for violating the DPPA. To\ndetermine whether the DPPA authorized the respondent-\nlawyers’ uses of DMV information, I first consider the\nposture of the Herron litigation at the time of the mailings\nto car purchasers. The complaint filed by respondent-\nlawyers on behalf of the car purchasers alleged that the\ndealers were involved in a conspiracy to charge unlawful\nfees. App. 138–139. In a competitive market, the lawyers\nurged, such conduct can succeed only when done in concert\nwith other dealers; otherwise, consumers would take their\nbusiness elsewhere. Meanwhile, the dealers moved to\ndismiss the conspiracy claim and argued there was no\nparty with standing to sue those dealers who had not sold\na car to a named plaintiff. Id., at 155.\n   The state court denied the dealers’ motion to dismiss,\nstating that the complaint alleged sufficient facts “sup-\nporting standing of the plaintiffs to proceed” against all\ndefendants, and that there were “sufficient allegations of\ncivil conspiracy” to avoid threshold dismissal of that claim.\nId., at 212.

In\nthat endeavor, as the Fourth Circuit recognized, they “did\nwhat any good lawyer would have done.” 675 F. 3d, at\n298.\n   This context illuminates how the letters at issue in this\ncase—which were mailed after the complaint was filed and\nwhile the dealers’ motion to dismiss was pending—served\nto advance the representative character of the suit during\na critical time in the Herron litigation. The letters included\na card asking recipients to respond by stating the type\nof car they had purchased, the name of the dealer and date\nof purchase, whether they had been charged the allegedly\nunlawful fee and, if so, the amount of the fee, and whether\nthey were interested in participating in the lawsuit. See,\ne.g., App. 93, 106. These questions served an investigative\npurpose: to gather information about the fees charged by\n——————\n  1 The  Court is thus incorrect to suggest that, early on in the state\ncourt litigation, plaintiffs’ standing to sue all dealers was definitively\nsettled. See ante, at 21. In fact, the state court left room for the\ndealer-defendants to renew their standing objection on completion of\ndiscovery.\n  2 The dealers thus were urging that additional plaintiffs were “neces-\n\nsary” to the maintenance of the dealer-conspiracy charge. Cf. ante, at\n13 ((b)(4) permits contacting persons “who are necessary parties”).\n6                       MARACICH v.

See\n675 F. 3d, at 285–286; ante, at 5 (faced with that insist-\nence, respondent-lawyers eventually dropped “all claims\nagainst dealerships without a corresponding plaintiff-\npurchaser”).\n                            II\n    The DPPA permits disclosure of personal information:\n       “For use in connection with any civil, criminal, admin-\n       istrative, or arbitral proceeding in any Federal, State,\n       or local court or agency or before any self-regulatory\n       body, including the service of process, investigation in\n       anticipation of litigation, and the execution or en-\n       forcement of judgments and orders, or pursuant to an\n       order of a Federal, State, or local court.” 18 U. S. C.\n——————\n    3 The\n        Herron litigation targeted a conspiracy to overcharge. Inquiries\ngeared to discovering the victims of the conspiracy cannot plausibly be\nwritten off as entirely noninvestigative in character. The Fourth\nCircuit so comprehended: “[T]he [l]awyers were looking to build and\nbolster a case against the dealerships if their initial information from\nconsumers proved the existence of plausibly systemic violations of the\nDealers Act.” 675 F. 3d 281, 299 (2012). The Court asserts that the\nCourt of Appeals “rejected respondents’ description of the letters as\ninvestigatory in nature.” Ante, at 25. That tells half the story. True,\nthe Fourth Circuit disagreed with the District Court’s determination\nthat “the [l]awyers were not engaged in [any] solicitation.” 675 F. 3d,\nat 293. But the appeals court twice clarified that, in developing the suit\nagainst the car dealers, the respondent-lawyers engaged in both inves-\ntigation and solicitation; indeed, the Fourth Circuit described the two\nas “inextricably intertwined.” Id., at 294, 300. No place did the Court\nof Appeals find that the communications were solicitations only, not at\nall “investigative.” In asserting otherwise, ante, at 25, the Court\nindulges in wishful thinking.\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The\nCourt’s attempt to read a solicitation-specific limitation\ninto this provision has no mooring in §2721(b)(4)’s text and\nmisperceives the structure of the DPPA.\n                              A\n   Congress used expansive language in framing the\n§2721(b)(4) exception, starting with the words “in connec-\ntion with” and thrice repeating the word “any.” See Mo-\nrales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374, 383\n(1992) (“The ordinary meaning of th[e] words [‘relating to’]\nis a broad one.”); Kasten v. Saint-Gobain Performance\nPlastics Corp., 563 U. S. 1, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7)\n(“[T]he phrase ‘any complaint’ suggests a broad interpreta-\ntion.”). Notably, the Court acknowledges that (b)(4) is\n“susceptible to a broad interpretation,” and, “in literal\nterms,” could be read “to include the personal information\nthat [respondent-lawyers] obtained here.” Ante, at 9.\n   This case should therefore be easy. One need not strain\nto see the connection between the respondent-lawyers’\nconduct and a specific civil proceeding. No attenuated\nchain of connection need be established. All the uses of\nDMV information at issue took place when a concrete civil\naction between identified parties was either imminent or\npending. Thus, the uses were indisputably “in connection\nwith” a civil proceeding.\n   The Court apparently recognizes that the initial re-\nquests for DMV information—to investigate the vitality of\nthe claims before filing suit—were in connection with the\nlitigation. See ante, at 27–28. But if anything, the later\nrequests and the letters mailed to car purchasers were\neven more closely tied to the case. The letters were sent\nafter litigation commenced, when the respondent-lawyers,\non behalf of their clients, were pursuing conspiracy claims\n8                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nagainst each of the defendant car dealers. Of equal im-\nportance, because the suit qualified under state law as a\nrepresentative action, respondent-lawyers represented\nand were obligated to serve the interests of all car pur-\nchasers affected by the charged illegal conduct. Respondent-\nlawyers’ uses of DMV information in aid of the Herron\nlitigation facilitated the discharge of their professional\nobligations to the court, their individual clients, and the\n“whole” group of named and unnamed purchasers that\nstate law required the lawyers to serve. S. C. Code Ann.\n§56–15–110(2).\n    It would be extraordinary for Congress to pass a law\ndisturbing the processes of a state court in such a case.\n“[T]he National Government, anxious though it may be to\nvindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests,\nalways endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly\ninterfere with the legitimate activities of the States,” and\nthis includes a general “deference to the state adjudicative\nprocess.” Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U. S. 413,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 15–16) (quoting Younger v. Harris,\n401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971)). We have taken special care to\nemphasize “the State’s strong interest in regulating mem-\nbers of the Bar,” Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436\nU. S. 447, 467 (1978), and have cautioned against undue\n“Federal interference with a State’s traditional regulation\nof [the legal] profession,” Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433\nU. S. 350, 362 (1977). One would therefore expect Con-\ngress to speak clearly if it intended to trench on state\ncontrol in this domain.\n    I find no such clear statement in the DPPA. Quite the\ncontrary, the DPPA instructs that “use [of DMV infor-\nmation] in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any\n. . . State . . . court” is permissible under federal law.\n§2721(b)(4).\n                              B\n    Rather than adopt a straightforward interpretation of\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe statute, the Court labors to justify reading a limitation\ninto (b)(4) that has no basis in the text of that provision.\nSolicitation, the Court says, is not permissible under (b)(4)\neven if it targets a specific civil proceeding. The Court\noffers two primary arguments for this conclusion. First,\nthe Court contends, a bar on solicitation must be read into\n(b)(4) lest that provision permit all uses “with a remote\nrelation to litigation.” Ante, at 9. Second, the Court as-\nserts, its interpretation is necessary to respect the “struc-\nture and purpose of the DPPA” and the “objective” of\nsubsection (b)(12). Ante, at 9, 17. Neither argument is\npersuasive.\n   I agree with the Court that the words “in connection\nwith” must be contained within reasonable bounds. But\nthe Court immediately jumps from this premise to the\nconclusion that “an attorney’s solicitation of prospective\nclients falls outside of [any reasonable] limit.” Ante, at\n10–11; ante, at 11, 13 (solicitation, a “discrete act” prohib-\nited by the statute, allows no exception for conduct “in\nconnection with litigation”). The leap is startling. In prior\ndecisions, when the Court has sought a limiting principle\nfor similar statutory language, it has done so to prevent\nthe application of a statute to matters with “only a tenu-\nous, remote, or peripheral connection” to the statute’s core\npurpose. New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue\nShield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 661\n(1995) (quoting District of Columbia v. Greater Washing-\nton Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S. 125, 130, n. 1 (1992)). The\nfocus, in other words, has been on the degree of connection\nbetween the concerns central to the law and the disputed\napplication of the measure.\n   The majority’s focus on solicitation, however, tells us\nalmost nothing about the degree of connection between the\nuse of DMV information and a civil proceeding. It matters\nnot to the Court whether a solicitation is of vital im-\nportance to an ongoing proceeding or far removed from\n10                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nany proceeding which may or may not be brought. A rule\nbarring any communication for which solicitation is a\npredominant purpose bears no logical relationship to the\n§2721(b)(4) phrase “in connection with.” And the majori-\nty’s concentration on solicitation is uninformative on the\ndegree of connection to a civil proceeding needed for uses\nof DMV information that do not involve solicitation.\n   The majority’s sojourn away from §2721(b)(4)’s text in\nsearch of a limiting principle is unwarranted. A limit to\nthe scope of (b)(4) can be readily identified by attending to\nthe phrasing of the provision and its focus on a “proceed-\ning.” Congress used similar language in the obstruction of\njustice statute, which criminalizes various attempts to\ninterfere with a “proceeding.” 18 U. S. C. §1512. The\nCourt had no difficulty identifying a limiting principle in\nthis term; it held that the statute applies only to persons\nwho “have in contemplation any particular official pro-\nceeding.” Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U. S.\n696, 708 (2005). By the same token, (b)(4) is best inter-\npreted to permit only uses tied to a concrete, particular\nproceeding.\n   Congress’ use of the phrase “in anticipation of litigation”\nprovides further support for this interpretation. The\nphrase is hardly unique to (b)(4); it is commonly used to\nrefer to the time at which the work-product privilege\nattaches to an attorney’s work for a client and the time at\nwhich a party has a duty to preserve material evidence.\nSee, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)(3) (“documents and\nother tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation” are not discoverable); Silvestri v. General Mo-\ntors Corp., 271 F. 3d 583, 592 (CA4 2001) (plaintiff had\n“failed to preserve material evidence in anticipation of\nlitigation”). Both now and when the DPPA was enacted,\ncourts have understood this phrase to require a concrete\ndispute between parties, and to exclude the abstract pos-\nsibility of a hypothetical lawsuit. See, e.g., National Union\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    11\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nFire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F. 2d 980, 984\n(CA4 1992) (the “general possibility of litigation” is not\nenough; a document is prepared in anticipation of litiga-\ntion when there is “an actual claim or a potential claim\nfollowing an actual event or series of events that reasona-\nbly could result in litigation”); Gould Inc. v. Mitsui Mining\n& Smelting Co., 825 F. 2d 676, 680 (CA2 1987) (applica-\ntion of Rule 26(b)(3) “depends upon the existence of a real,\nrather than speculative, concern”).\n   Usage of the same words in other prescriptions indicates\nthat (b)(4) is indeed limited by its text. A hypothetical\ncase without identified adverse parties is not encompassed\nby (b)(4). To anticipate a particular civil proceeding, a\nlawyer must have a client whose claim presents a genuine\ncontroversy.4 Trolling for prospective clients with no\nactual or imminent proceeding, involving already identi-\nfied adverse parties, in sight—apparently, the Court’s\nprimary concern—would not be a permissible use.5 Af-\nfirming the judgment below, the Court fears, would permit\nlawyers to bring placeholder lawsuits on behalf of\n“friend[s] or family member[s],” then use DMV data to\nsolicit plaintiffs for “a lawsuit that would otherwise be\ndismissed for lack of standing.” Ante, at 20–21. This is a\ncanard. No court would hold such a case a genuine con-\n——————\n   4 Respondent-lawyers propose a broader reading of (b)(4), arguing\n\nthat any use tied to an identified “transaction, occurrence, [or] defect”\nshould be permissible. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Their reading, however,\nfails to account for all the words in (b)(4), most notably the provision’s\nfocus on a “proceeding.” See Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544\nU. S. 696, 707–708, and n. 10 (2005) (destroying evidence of suspicious\ntransactions could not give rise to liability under 18 U. S. C. §1512\nunless done in contemplation of a particular proceeding).\n   5 Furthermore, a use consistent with federal law may nevertheless be\n\nimpermissible. The State makes the ultimate choice whether to release\nDMV information for any purpose under (b)(4). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.\nStates are well suited to policing attorney conduct, a sphere of tradi-\ntional state authority.\n12                  MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntroversy. The Court’s hypothetical bears not even a re-\nmote resemblance to the facts of this case. The state court\nhere denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the conspir-\nacy claim on standing grounds. Supra, at 4–5. See also\nante, at 5 (describing the state court’s ruling that the\nnamed plaintiffs had standing to sue the “dealerships from\nwhich they had purchased automobiles and any alleged co-\nconspirators” (emphasis added)).\n   This case is squarely within the metes and bounds of\n(b)(4). The letters advanced the concrete interests of the\nrespondent-lawyers’ clients within a pending adversarial\ncivil proceeding in state court. Just as the letters at issue\nin this case would be in contemplation of a particular\n“proceeding” as that term is used in 18 U. S. C. §1512, and\nwould be “in anticipation of litigation” as Rule 26(b)(3)\nemploys that term, they fall within the very same lan-\nguage as it appears in §2721(b)(4).\n   The Court’s second argument is no more convincing. A\nsevere limit must be read into (b)(4), the Court urges, to\nrespect the structure of the statute. Specifically, the\nCourt spotlights that another permissible use, (b)(12),\nallows “bulk distribution for surveys, marketing or solici-\ntations,” but only to individuals who have consented to\nallow use of their information for this purpose. Petitioners\nhere devoted much of their briefing to arguing that (b)(12)\nis somehow more “specific” than (b)(4), see Brief for Peti-\ntioners 18–31; Reply Brief 3–12, but the Court rightly\nrejects that reasoning. Ante, at 16. Neither provision is\nmore specific than the other; the two simply cover differ-\nent subjects.\n   Without the specific-governs-the-general canon, the case\nfor using (b)(12) to interpret (b)(4) evaporates. The Court\nsuggests there would be “tension” between the two provi-\nsions if a use of DMV information were permitted by (b)(4)\nbut not permitted by (b)(12). Ante, at 21. Every permissi-\nble use of DMV information, however, is permitted by\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   13\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsome—often just one—of the 14 enumerated exceptions\nand not permitted by others. The DPPA surely does not\nconvey that every time a person obtains DMV information\nin accord with one exception, that exception comes into\nconflict with other exceptions under which the information\ncould not be obtained. Indeed, it is the Court’s opinion\nthat creates tension, by taking a use that would be per-\nmissible under (b)(4)—and therefore permissible under the\nDPPA—and importing into it a restriction delineated in an\nentirely different exception.\n  If applied generally to §2721(b), the Court’s approach\nwould frustrate the evident congressional purpose to\nprovide a set of separate exceptions, any one of which\nmakes permissible the uses therein. Consider a consulting\ncompany hired by a State to conduct research into motor\nvehicle safety. Depending on the particulars of the re-\nsearch project, the company might seek to obtain DMV\ninformation under the uses listed in (b)(1), (2), (5), (12), or\n(14).6 These exceptions entail different requirements, so\nthe project might well fit within one or two of them but not\nthe others. It would be ludicrous to treat the fact that the\nproject did not fit within one exception as establishing\nthat the project should not be allowed under any other\nexception. Construing the DPPA in that manner would\nrender the statute totally unworkable. The majority does\nnot take that outlandish position with respect to all the\nexceptions. Ante, at 16. Instead, without any congres-\nsional instruction to do so, the Court reads (b)(12)—the\n12th on a list of 14 permissible uses—as so central a part\n——————\n  6 The exception in (b)(1) covers uses by a State or entity acting on\n\nbehalf of a State; (b)(2) covers uses for matters of motor vehicle or\ndriver safety; (b)(5) covers uses in research activities; (b)(12) covers\nuses for surveys; and (b)(14) covers uses related to the operation of a\nmotor vehicle or public safety, if authorized by state law. The degree of\noverlap among these provisions undermines the Court’s suggestion that\nthe list should be read to avoid surplusage. Ante, at 20.\n14                      MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nof the DPPA that it alone narrows the scope of other\nexceptions.\n                             III\n   Under the most sensible reading of §2721(b)(4), see\nsupra, at 6–7, the uses of DMV information at issue here\nwould be permissible. The dispositive question should be:\nIs the use tied to a concrete civil action between identified\nparties that is ongoing or impending? Even if the statute\ncould be viewed as ambiguous, there is ample reason to\nadopt that straightforward reading.          The alternative\nreading embraced by the Court generates uncertainty\nregarding the scope of other uses enumerated in §2721(b);\ncreates difficult line-drawing problems; and imposes crim-\ninal and draconian civil liability, at odds with the principle\nof lenity.\n   First, the Court’s reading clouds other uses the DPPA\npermits.     According to the Court, the exceptions in\n§2721(b) should be construed so as not to “interfere” with\n(b)(12), which “implements an important objective of the\nDPPA.” Ante, at 17–18.7 Therefore, (b)(12) is “relevan[t]”\nin interpreting those “exceptions whose breadth and appli-\ncation are uncertain.” Ante, at 18. Little light is cast on\nwhich enumerated exceptions fit that description. Subsec-\ntion (b)(4) fits, the Court asserts, but (b)(1) apparently\n——————\n   7 The placement of (b)(12) toward the end of a list of 14 hardly signals\n\nits special importance. The Court cites Reno v. Condon, 528 U. S. 141,\n143, 148 (2000), but the cited passages do not so much as suggest that\n(b)(12) is more central to the congressional purpose than other excep-\ntions. From the text and history of the DPPA, it would be fair to say\nthat the driving purpose of the Act was to prevent access to information\nby criminals and stalkers, while allowing access for legitimate govern-\nmental and business purposes. See supra, at 2–3. Giving primacy to\n(b)(12) is all the more questionable, for that exception was included not\nto proscribe, but to allow, some direct marketing. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 29. Absent the provision, the DPPA would permit no such\nuse.\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)        15\n\n                         GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ndoes not. See ibid. But what makes (b)(1) clear, while\n(b)(4) is uncertain? The Court provides no answer, not\neven a clue. Lower courts will be left to puzzle over when\n(b)(12) comes to the fore, rendering impermissible uses\nthat otherwise fit within another exception.\n   The Court sows further confusion by narrowly construing\nthe four exceptions that permit disclosure of information\nthe DPPA ranks as “highly restricted personal infor-\nmation.” §2721(a)(2); see ante, at 14. These exceptions\napply to uses by the government, (b)(1); court opera-\ntions, (b)(4); use by insurance companies, entities perva-\nsively regulated by the States, (b)(6); and commercial\ndriver’s licenses, which are regulated by the Federal Gov-\nernment and administered by the States, (b)(9).8\n   A common thread unites the four categories: All involve\nthe functioning or oversight of state governments on mat-\nters important to the State and persons within the State’s\ngovernance. For uses of this genre, the need for the in-\nformation can be especially high, and the likelihood of\nmisuse, especially low. Congress therefore took care to\nauthorize broad access to DMV information for uses these\nexceptions allow. I would read §2721(b) as according\nthe States ample leeway to use and authorize use of their\nown DMV information in these areas of traditional state\nauthority.\n   Second, the Court’s holding is hard to grasp and will be\ndifficult to apply. The Court first suggests that “[t]he\nproper solution is to draw the line at solicitation itself,” to\n“exclud[e] [solicitation] from the activity permitted in\n(b)(4).” Ante, at 21. Backing away from this clear, if\nerroneous, solution, the Court settles on an inquiry into\n“whether obtaining, using, or disclosing the personal\ninformation . . . had the predominant purpose to solicit.”\nAnte, at 22. The Court’s cryptic discussion of its “predom-\n——————\n 8 See   49 U. S. C. §31308.\n16                     MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ninant purpose” test inspires little confidence. See ibid.\n(the purpose “might be evident from the communication\nitself,” but “[c]lose cases may arise”). In truth, however,\nthe line between a lawyer’s function as an officer of the\ncourt and her notice to, and solicitation of, new clients\nmay be indistinct. See infra, at 17, n. 10.\n   Consider an attorney whose client has been the victim of\na hit-and-run. The victim recalls the license plate of\nanother car at the scene, which was also hit by the offend-\ning driver. In order to investigate her client’s case, and to\nensure that “there is a supportable theory for a com-\nplaint,” ante, at 14, a responsible attorney would contact\nthis second victim, who may be able to provide useful\ninformation about the incident. But the second victim is\nalso a potential plaintiff in her own right. A communica-\ntion might therefore be viewed by the state bar as falling\nwithin the rules for solicitation. See S. C. Rule of Profes-\nsional Conduct 7.3(d) (2012) (solicitation rule applies to\ncommunications between an attorney and “a prospective\nclient known to be in need of legal services in a particular\nmatter”).9 Under today’s decision, the attorney will be in\nan impossible position. Her duties to her client—and to\nthe court to conduct a reasonable investigation before\nfiling a lawsuit—instruct her to contact the potential\nwitness. To avoid running afoul of the state bar’s rules,\nhowever, she may need to label any communication with\nthe witness as a solicitation. But if she does that, today’s\nruling would expose her to liability under the DPPA.\n   This example is not so far removed from the facts of this\ncase. Petitioners conceded, both in their briefs and at oral\nargument, that the DPPA would have permitted respond-\nents to contact the purchasers of cars to ask them whether\n——————\n  9 Beyond debate, the solicitation here was permissible under South\n\nCarolina’s ethics rules. Petitioners do not argue otherwise. The Court\nconsiders this a “relevant,” but not “dispositive” factor. Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

But in this case, as in the hypothetical case\njust posed, investigating the facts involved contacting\npeople who might potentially become parties. And profes-\nsional rules regarding solicitation may well apply to such\ncommunications.\n   Reality thus belies the Court’s pretense that a bright\nline separates solicitation from other aspects of a lawyer’s\nrole as officer of the court. Perhaps aware that, in many\ncases, the line will be hazy or hard to find, the Court\nresorts to inapposite comparisons. The Court notes, for\nexample, that it would be impermissible for a lawyer to\nuse information obtained from the DMV to send out adver-\ntisements for “a book he wrote.” Ante, at 24. But no one\nwould confuse bookselling with investigation in anticipa-\ntion of litigation; such a use would be impermissible under\nany reading of (b)(4).\n   The Court’s disposition will require lower courts to\nparse whether every communication using DMV infor-\nmation in the course of litigation has solicitation as a\n“predominant purpose.” Ante, at 22. The holding in Mar-\nacich’s case, I fear, will, at a minimum, impede the effi-\ncient administration of state-court litigation and may well\nprove infeasible.10 Cf. United States v. Jicarilla Apache\nNation, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 18) (rejecting\n\n——————\n   10 Suppose the state court had ordered respondents, as a condition of\n\nretaining certain defendant-dealers in the suit, to bring in purchasers\nfrom those dealers. Cf. supra, at 4–5. Under today’s decision, the\nlawyers’ compliance with the court’s order would place them at risk of\nliability under the DPPA. See ante, at 23 (recognizing that (b)(4) would\npermit an attorney to send class notice “pursuant to a court order,” but\nexpressing uncertainty whether even a court order would permit the\nmailings here at issue). Congress could hardly have intended to create\nsuch a conflict.\n18                 MARACICH v. SPEARS\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nas unworkable a “case-by-case inquiry into the purpose of\neach communication” involving government attorneys in\nthe administration of tribal trusts).\n   This case illustrates the problem. In truth, the letters\nserved both as an investigative tool and as an invitation to\ncar purchasers to join the Herron suit. How is the fact-\nfinder to determine which purpose was predominant?\nToss a coin when the trier finds the answer is: “six of one,\nhalf dozen of the other”? As the Court of Appeals recog-\nnized, the use here, although qualifying as a solicitation,\n“was inextricably intertwined with investigation and\nprosecution of the Herron litigation.” 675 F. 3d, at 300.\n   Finally, the rule of lenity requires that we resolve any\nresidual ambiguity in respondents’ favor. Petitioners\nsought $2,500 in statutory damages for every letter\nmailed—a total of some $200 million—and punitive dam-\nages to boot. Brief for Respondents 15. Such damages\ncannot possibly represent a legislative judgment regarding\naverage actual damage. The Court’s opinion is wrong to\nsuggest that the rule of lenity does not apply to govern-\nmental penalties so long as they are payable to private\nindividuals and labeled “liquidated damages,” rather than\n“criminal fines.” Moreover, the DPPA, which appears in\nTitle 18 of the United States Code, imposes criminal liabil-\nity for a knowing violation of its provisions. 18 U. S. C.\n§2723(a). Because this is a civil case, I need not consider\nwhat defenses respondent-lawyers might have were they\ncriminally prosecuted. But because we are interpreting a\ncriminal statute, “it is appropriate to apply the rule of\nlenity in resolving any ambiguity in the ambit of the stat-\nute’s coverage,” even in a civil case. Crandon v. United\nStates, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990). See also Leocal v. Ash-\ncroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12, n. 8 (2004) (explaining that, if a\nstatute has criminal applications, “the rule of lenity ap-\nplies” to the Court’s interpretation of the statute\n“[b]ecause we must interpret the statute consistently,\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But it finds any\nambiguity in these phrases resolved by the structure of\nthe DPPA. Ibid. What “structure,” one may ask, other\nthan an enumeration of 14 discrete exceptions, each per-\nmitting disclosure? See supra, at 11–12. The DPPA has\nbeen in effect for over 15 years, and yet the Court points to\nno judicial decision interpreting the statute in the way it\ndoes today. We should hesitate to adopt a novel interpre-\ntation of a federal statute that subjects parties to crushing\nliability. “[I]t is reasonable that a fair warning should be\ngiven to the world in language that the common world will\nunderstand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line\nis passed.” McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27\n(1931) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.). Respondent-\nlawyers were given no such fair warning.\n                            IV\n  The Court today exposes lawyers whose conduct meets\nstate ethical requirements to huge civil liability and po-\ntential criminal liability. It does so by adding to the\nDPPA’s litigation exception a solicitation bar Congress did\nnot place in that exception.
