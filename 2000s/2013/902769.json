Argued March 25, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984\n  (Hatch-Waxman Act or Act) creates special procedures for identifying\n  and resolving patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug\n  manufacturers, one of which requires a prospective generic manufac-\n  turer to assure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it will\n  not infringe the brand-name’s patents. One way to provide such as-\n  surance (the “paragraph IV” route) is by certifying that any listed,\n  relevant patent “is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufac-\n  ture, use, or sale” of the generic drug.                  21 U. S. C.\n  §355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV).\n    Respondent Solvay Pharmaceuticals obtained a patent for its ap-\n  proved brand-name drug AndroGel. Subsequently, respondents Ac-\n  tavis and Paddock filed applications for generic drugs modeled after\n  AndroGel and certified under paragraph IV that Solvay’s patent was\n  invalid and that their drugs did not infringe it. Solvay sued Actavis\n  and Paddock, claiming patent infringement.           See 35 U. S. C.\n  §271(e)(2)(A). The FDA eventually approved Actavis’ generic prod-\n  uct, but instead of bringing its drug to market, Actavis entered into a\n  “reverse payment” settlement agreement with Solvay, agreeing not to\n  bring its generic to market for a specified number of years and agree-\n  ing to promote AndroGel to doctors in exchange for millions of dol-\n  lars. Paddock made a similar agreement with Solvay, as did re-\n  spondent Par, another manufacturer aligned in the patent litigation\n  with Paddock.\n    The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed suit, alleging that re-\n  spondents violated §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by un-\n  lawfully agreeing to abandon their patent challenges, to refrain from\n2                          FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    launching their low-cost generic drugs, and to share in Solvay’s mo-\n    nopoly profits. The District Court dismissed the complaint. The\n    Eleventh Circuit concluded that as long as the anticompetitive effects\n    of a settlement fall within the scope of the patent’s exclusionary po-\n    tential, the settlement is immune from antitrust attack. Noting that\n    the FTC had not alleged that the challenged agreements excluded\n    competition to a greater extent than would the patent, if valid, it af-\n    firmed the complaint’s dismissal. It further recognized that if parties\n    to this sort of case do not settle, a court might declare a patent inva-\n    lid. But since public policy favors the settlement of disputes, it held\n    that courts could not require parties to continue to litigate in order to\n    avoid antitrust liability.\nHeld: The Eleventh Circuit erred in affirming the dismissal of the\n FTC’s complaint. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) Although the anticompetitive effects of the reverse settlement\n agreement might fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\n Solvay’s patent, this does not immunize the agreement from antitrust\n attack. For one thing, to refer simply to what the holder of a valid\n patent could do does not by itself answer the antitrust question.\n Here, the paragraph IV litigation put the patent’s validity and pre-\n clusive scope at issue, and the parties’ settlement—in which, the FTC\n alleges, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants millions to stay out\n of its market, even though the defendants had no monetary claim\n against the plaintiff—ended that litigation. That form of settlement\n is unusual, and there is reason for concern that such settlements\n tend to have significant adverse effects on competition. It would be\n incongruous to determine antitrust legality by measuring the settle-\n ment’s anticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy, and\n not against procompetitive antitrust policies as well. Both are rele-\n vant in determining the scope of monopoly and antitrust immunity\n conferred by a patent, see, e.g., United States v. Line Material Co.,\n 333 U. S. 287, 310, 311, and the antitrust question should be an-\n swered by considering traditional antitrust factors. For another\n thing, this Court’s precedents make clear that patent-related settle-\n ment agreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws. See, e.g.,\n United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174; United States v. New\n Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U. S. 371; Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United\n States, 283 U. S. 163. Finally, the Hatch-Waxman Act’s general pro-\n competitive thrust—facilitating challenges to a patent’s validity and\n requiring parties to a paragraph IV dispute to report settlement\n terms to federal antitrust regulators—suggests a view contrary to the\n Eleventh Circuit’s. Pp. 8–14.\n    (b) While the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion finds some support in a\n general legal policy favoring the settlement of disputes, its related\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nunderlying practical concern consists of its fear that antitrust scruti-\nny of a reverse payment agreement would require the parties to en-\ngage in time-consuming, complex, and expensive litigation to demon-\nstrate what would have happened to competition absent the\nsettlement. However, five sets of considerations lead to the conclu-\nsion that this concern should not determine the result here and that\nthe FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove its anti-\ntrust claim. First, the specific restraint at issue has the “potential for\ngenuine adverse effects on competition.” FTC v. Indiana Federation\nof Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 460–461. Payment for staying out of the\nmarket keeps prices at patentee-set levels and divides the benefit be-\ntween the patentee and the challenger, while the consumer loses.\nAnd two Hatch-Waxman Act features—the 180-day exclusive-right-\nto-sell advantage given to the first paragraph IV challenger to win\nFDA approval, §355(j)(5)(B)(iv), and the roughly 30-month period\nthat the subsequent manufacturers would be required to wait out be-\nfore winning FDA approval, §355(j)(5)(B)(iii)—mean that a reverse\nsettlement agreement with the first filer removes from consideration\nthe manufacturer most likely to introduce competition quickly. Se-\ncond, these anticompetitive consequences will at least sometimes\nprove unjustified. There may be justifications for reverse payment\nthat are not the result of having sought or brought about anticompet-\nitive consequences, but that does not justify dismissing the FTC’s\ncomplaint without examining the potential justifications. Third,\nwhere a reverse payment threatens to work unjustified anticompeti-\ntive harm, the patentee likely has the power to bring about that\nharm in practice. The size of the payment from a branded drug\nmanufacturer to a generic challenger is a strong indicator of such\npower. Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more feasible\nadministratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed. It is normally\nnot necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust ques-\ntion. A large, unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable\nsurrogate for a patent’s weakness, all without forcing a court to con-\nduct a detailed exploration of the patent’s validity. Fifth, the fact\nthat a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does\nnot prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuits. As in oth-\ner industries, they may settle in other ways, e.g., by allowing the ge-\nneric manufacturer to enter the patentee’s market before the patent\nexpires without the patentee’s paying the challenger to stay out prior\nto that point. Pp. 14–20.\n   (c) This Court declines to hold that reverse payment settlement\nagreements are presumptively unlawful. Courts reviewing such\nagreements should proceed by applying the “rule of reason,” rather\nthan under a “quick look” approach. See California Dental Assn. v.\n4                         FTC v.

Because the settlement requires the patentee to pay\nthe alleged infringer, rather than the other way around,\nthis kind of settlement agreement is often called a “reverse\npayment” settlement agreement. And the basic question\nhere is whether such an agreement can sometimes unrea­\nsonably diminish competition in violation of the antitrust\nlaws. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1 (Sherman Act prohibition\nof “restraint[s] of trade or commerce”). Cf. Palmer v. BRG of\nGa., Inc., 498 U. S. 46 (1990) (per curiam) (invalidating\nagreement not to compete).\n   In this case, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed a Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC) complaint claiming that a par­\nticular reverse payment settlement agreement violated\nthe antitrust laws. In doing so, the Circuit stated that a\nreverse payment settlement agreement generally is “im­\n2                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive\neffects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\nthe patent.” FTC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 677\nF. 3d 1298, 1312 (2012). And since the alleged infringer’s\npromise not to enter the patentee’s market expired before\nthe patent’s term ended, the Circuit found the agreement\nlegal and dismissed the FTC complaint. Id., at 1315. In\nour view, however, reverse payment settlements such as\nthe agreement alleged in the complaint before us can some­\ntimes violate the antitrust laws. We consequently hold\nthat the Eleventh Circuit should have allowed the FTC’s\nlawsuit to proceed.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Apparently most if not all reverse payment settlement\nagreements arise in the context of pharmaceutical drug\nregulation, and specifically in the context of suits brought\nunder statutory provisions allowing a generic drug manu­\nfacturer (seeking speedy marketing approval) to challenge\nthe validity of a patent owned by an already-approved\nbrand-name drug owner. See Brief for Petitioner 29; 12 P.\nAreeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶2046, p. 338\n(3d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Areeda); Hovenkamp, Sensible\nAntitrust Rules for Pharmaceutical Competition, 39\nU. S. F. L. Rev. 11, 24 (2004). We consequently describe\nfour key features of the relevant drug-regulatory frame­\nwork established by the Drug Price Competition and\nPatent Term Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585, as\namended. That Act is commonly known as the Hatch-\nWaxman Act.\n  First, a drug manufacturer, wishing to market a new\nprescription drug, must submit a New Drug Application to\nthe federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\nundergo a long, comprehensive, and costly testing process,\nafter which, if successful, the manufacturer will receive\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarketing approval from the FDA. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(b)(1) (requiring, among other things, “full reports of\ninvestigations” into safety and effectiveness; “a full list\nof the articles used as components”; and a “full description”\nof how the drug is manufactured, processed, and packed).\n   Second, once the FDA has approved a brand-name drug\nfor marketing, a manufacturer of a generic drug can ob­\ntain similar marketing approval through use of abbrevi­\nated procedures. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a generic\nmanufacturer to file an Abbreviated New Drug Appli­\ncation specifying that the generic has the “same active\ningredients as,” and is “biologically equivalent” to, the al­\nready-approved brand-name drug. Caraco Pharmaceutical\nLaboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 566 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 2) (citing 21 U. S. C. §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii),\n(iv)). In this way the generic manufacturer can obtain\napproval while avoiding the “costly and time-consuming\nstudies” needed to obtain approval “for a pioneer drug.”\nSee Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661,\n676 (1990). The Hatch-Waxman process, by allowing the\ngeneric to piggy-back on the pioneer’s approval efforts,\n“speed[s] the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to\nmarket,” Caraco, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2), thereby\nfurthering drug competition.\n   Third, the Hatch-Waxman Act sets forth special pro­\ncedures for identifying, and resolving, related patent dis­\nputes. It requires the pioneer brand-name manufacturer\nto list in its New Drug Application the “number and the\nexpiration date” of any relevant patent. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(b)(1). And it requires the generic manufacturer in its\nAbbreviated New Drug Application to “assure the FDA”\nthat the generic “will not infringe” the brand-name’s pa­\ntents. See Caraco, supra, at___ (slip op., at 3).\n   The generic can provide this assurance in one of several\nways. See 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A)(vii). It can certify that\nthe brand-name manufacturer has not listed any rele-\n4                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvant patents. It can certify that any relevant patents have\nexpired. It can request approval to market beginning\nwhen any still-in-force patents expire. Or, it can certify\nthat any listed, relevant patent “is invalid or will not be\ninfringed by the manufacture, use, or sale” of the drug\ndescribed in the Abbreviated New Drug Application. See\n§355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Taking this last-mentioned route\n(called the “paragraph IV” route), automatically counts as\npatent infringement, see 35 U. S. C. §271(e)(2)(A) (2006\ned., Supp. V), and often “means provoking litigation.”\nCaraco, supra, at___ (slip op., at 5). If the brand-name\npatentee brings an infringement suit within 45 days, the\nFDA then must withhold approving the generic, usually\nfor a 30-month period, while the parties litigate patent\nvalidity (or infringement) in court. If the courts decide the\nmatter within that period, the FDA follows that determi­\nnation; if they do not, the FDA may go forward and give\napproval to market the generic product. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iii).\n   Fourth, Hatch-Waxman provides a special incentive for\na generic to be the first to file an Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication taking the paragraph IV route. That ap-\nplicant will enjoy a period of 180 days of exclusivity (from\nthe first commercial marketing of its drug).              See\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (establishing exclusivity period). During\nthat period of exclusivity no other generic can compete\nwith the brand-name drug. If the first-to-file generic\nmanufacturer can overcome any patent obstacle and bring\nthe generic to market, this 180-day period of exclusivity\ncan prove valuable, possibly “worth several hundred mil­\nlion dollars.” Hemphill, Paying for Delay: Pharmaceutical\nPatent Settlement as a Regulatory Design Problem, 81\nN. Y. U. L. Rev. 1553, 1579 (2006). Indeed, the Generic\nPharmaceutical Association said in 2006 that the “ ‘vast\nmajority of potential profits for a generic drug manufac­\nturer materialize during the 180-day exclusivity period.’ ”\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioner 6 (quoting statement). The 180-day ex-\nclusivity period, however, can belong only to the first\ngeneric to file. Should that first-to-file generic forfeit the\nexclusivity right in one of the ways specified by statute, no\nother generic can obtain it. See §355(j)(5)(D).\n                              B\n                               1\n   In 1999, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, a respondent here,\nfiled a New Drug Application for a brand-name drug called\nAndroGel. The FDA approved the application in 2000. In\n2003, Solvay obtained a relevant patent and disclosed that\nfact to the FDA, 677 F. 3d, at 1308, as Hatch-Waxman\nrequires. See §355(c)(2) (requiring, in addition, that FDA\nmust publish new patent information upon submission).\n   Later the same year another respondent, Actavis, Inc.\n(then known as Watson Pharmaceuticals), filed an Abbre­\nviated New Drug Application for a generic drug modeled\nafter AndroGel. Subsequently, Paddock Laboratories, also\na respondent, separately filed an Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication for its own generic product. Both Actavis and\nPaddock certified under paragraph IV that Solvay’s listed\npatent was invalid and their drugs did not infringe it. A\nfourth manufacturer, Par Pharmaceutical, likewise a re-\nspondent, did not file an application of its own but joined\nforces with Paddock, agreeing to share the patent litiga­\ntion costs in return for a share of profits if Paddock ob­\ntained approval for its generic drug.\n   Solvay initiated paragraph IV patent litigation against\nActavis and Paddock. Thirty months later the FDA ap­\nproved Actavis’ first-to-file generic product, but, in 2006,\nthe patent-litigation parties all settled. Under the terms\nof the settlement Actavis agreed that it would not bring its\ngeneric to market until August 31, 2015, 65 months before\nSolvay’s patent expired (unless someone else marketed a\ngeneric sooner). Actavis also agreed to promote AndroGel\n6                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto urologists. The other generic manufacturers made\nroughly similar promises. And Solvay agreed to pay mil­\nlions of dollars to each generic—$12 million in total to\nPaddock; $60 million in total to Par; and an estimated\n$19–$30 million annually, for nine years, to Actavis. See\nApp. 46, 49–50, Complaint ¶¶66, 77. The companies de-\nscribed these payments as compensation for other services\nthe generics promised to perform, but the FTC contends\nthe other services had little value. According to the FTC\nthe true point of the payments was to compensate the\ngenerics for agreeing not to compete against AndroGel\nuntil 2015. See id., at 50–53, Complaint ¶¶81–85.\n                              2\n   On January 29, 2009, the FTC filed this lawsuit against\nall the settling parties, namely, Solvay, Actavis, Paddock,\nand Par. The FTC’s complaint (as since amended) alleged\nthat respondents violated §5 of the Federal Trade Com­\nmission Act, 15 U. S. C. §45, by unlawfully agreeing “to\nshare in Solvay’s monopoly profits, abandon their patent\nchallenges, and refrain from launching their low-cost\ngeneric products to compete with AndroGel for nine\nyears.” App. 29, Complaint ¶5. See generally FTC v.\nIndiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 454 (1986)\n(Section 5 “encompass[es] . . . practices that violate the\nSherman Act and the other antitrust laws”). The District\nCourt held that these allegations did not set forth an\nantitrust law violation.

The FTC\nappealed.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed\nthe District Court. It wrote that “absent sham litigation\nor fraud in obtaining the patent, a reverse payment set­\ntlement is immune from antitrust attack so long as its\nanticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclu­\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The\ncourt recognized that “antitrust laws typically prohibit\nagreements where one company pays a potential competi­\ntor not to enter the market.” Id., at 1307 (citing Valley\nDrug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 344 F. 3d 1294,\n1304 (CA11 2003)). See also Palmer, 498 U. S., at 50\n(agreement to divide territorial markets held “unlawful on\nits face”). But, the court found that “reverse payment\nsettlements of patent litigation presen[t] atypical cases\nbecause one of the parties owns a patent.” 677 F. 3d, at\n1307 (internal quotation marks and second alteration\nomitted). Patent holders have a “lawful right to exclude\nothers from the market,” ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted); thus a patent “conveys the right to cripple com­\npetition.” Id., at 1310 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court recognized that, if the parties to this sort of case\ndo not settle, a court might declare the patent invalid. Id.,\nat 1305. But, in light of the public policy favoring settle­\nment of disputes (among other considerations) it held that\nthe courts could not require the parties to continue to\nlitigate in order to avoid antitrust liability. Id., at 1313–\n1314.\n   The FTC sought certiorari. Because different courts\nhave reached different conclusions about the application of\nthe antitrust laws to Hatch-Waxman-related patent set­\ntlements, we granted the FTC’s petition. Compare, e.g.,\nid., at 1312 (case below) (settlements generally “immune\nfrom antitrust attack”); In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride\nAntitrust Litigation, 544 F. 3d 1323, 1332–1337 (CA Fed.\n2008) (similar); In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litiga-\ntion, 466 F. 3d 187, 212–213 (CA2 2006) (similar), with\nIn re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, 686 F. 3d 197, 214–218\n(CA3 2012) (settlements presumptively unlawful).\n8                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Solvay’s patent, if valid and infringed, might have per­\nmitted it to charge drug prices sufficient to recoup the\nreverse settlement payments it agreed to make to its po­\ntential generic competitors. And we are willing to take\nthis fact as evidence that the agreement’s “anticompetitive\neffects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\nthe patent.” 677 F. 3d, at 1312. But we do not agree that\nthat fact, or characterization, can immunize the agree­\nment from antitrust attack.\n   For one thing, to refer, as the Circuit referred, simply to\nwhat the holder of a valid patent could do does not by\nitself answer the antitrust question. The patent here may\nor may not be valid, and may or may not be infringed. “[A]\nvalid patent excludes all except its owner from the use of\nthe protected process or product,” United States v. Line\nMaterial Co., 333 U. S. 287, 308 (1948) (emphasis added).\nAnd that exclusion may permit the patent owner to charge\na higher-than-competitive price for the patented product.\nBut an invalidated patent carries with it no such right.\nAnd even a valid patent confers no right to exclude prod­\nucts or processes that do not actually infringe. The para­\ngraph IV litigation in this case put the patent’s validity at\nissue, as well as its actual preclusive scope. The parties’\nsettlement ended that litigation. The FTC alleges that in\nsubstance, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants many\nmillions of dollars to stay out of its market, even though\nthe defendants did not have any claim that the plaintiff\nwas liable to them for damages. That form of settlement\nis unusual. And, for reasons discussed in Part II–B,\ninfra, there is reason for concern that settlements tak­\ning this form tend to have significant adverse effects on\ncompetition.\n   Given these factors, it would be incongruous to deter­\nmine antitrust legality by measuring the settlement’s\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy,\nrather than by measuring them against procompetitive\nantitrust policies as well. And indeed, contrary to the\nCircuit’s view that the only pertinent question is whether\n“the settlement agreement . . . fall[s] within” the legiti­\nmate “scope” of the patent’s “exclusionary potential,” 677\nF. 3d, at 1309, 1312, this Court has indicated that patent\nand antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the\n“scope of the patent monopoly”—and consequently anti­\ntrust law immunity—that is conferred by a patent.\n   Thus, the Court in Line Material explained that “the\nimproper use of [a patent] monopoly,” is “invalid” under\nthe antitrust laws and resolved the antitrust question in\nthat case by seeking an accommodation “between the law-\nful restraint on trade of the patent monopoly and the\nillegal restraint prohibited broadly by the Sherman Act.”\n333 U. S., at 310. To strike that balance, the Court asked\nquestions such as whether “the patent statute specifically\ngives a right” to restrain competition in the manner chal­\nlenged; and whether “competition is impeded to a greater\ndegree” by the restraint at issue than other restraints\npreviously approved as reasonable. Id., at 311. See also\nUnited States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364,\n390–391 (1948) (courts must “balance the privileges of [the\npatent holder] and its licensees under the patent grants\nwith the prohibitions of the Sherman Act against combi-\nnations and attempts to monopolize”); Walker Process\nEquipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382\nU. S. 172, 174 (1965) (“[E]nforcement of a patent procured\nby fraud” may violate the Sherman Act). In short, rather\nthan measure the length or amount of a restriction solely\nagainst the length of the patent’s term or its earning\npotential, as the Court of Appeals apparently did here,\nthis Court answered the antitrust question by considering\ntraditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive\neffects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially\n10                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noffsetting legal considerations present in the circumstances,\nsuch as here those related to patents. See Part II–B,\ninfra. Whether a particular restraint lies “beyond the\nlimits of the patent monopoly” is a conclusion that flows\nfrom that analysis and not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE sug­\ngests, its starting point. Post, at 3, 8 (dissenting opinion).\n   For another thing, this Court’s precedents make clear\nthat patent-related settlement agreements can sometimes\nviolate the antitrust laws. In United States v. Singer\nMfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174 (1963), for example, two sewing\nmachine companies possessed competing patent claims; a\nthird company sought a patent under circumstances where\ndoing so might lead to the disclosure of information that\nwould invalidate the other two firms’ patents. All three\nfirms settled their patent-related disagreements while\nassigning the broadest claims to the firm best able to\nenforce the patent against yet other potential competitors.\nId., at 190–192. The Court did not examine whether, on\nthe assumption that all three patents were valid, patent\nlaw would have allowed the patents’ holders to do the\nsame. Rather, emphasizing that the Sherman Act “im­\nposes strict limitations on the concerted activities in which\npatent owners may lawfully engage,” id., at 197, it held\nthat the agreements, although settling patent disputes,\nviolated the antitrust laws. Id., at 195, 197. And that, in\nimportant part, was because “the public interest in grant­\ning patent monopolies” exists only to the extent that “the\npublic is given a novel and useful invention” in “considera­\ntion for its grant.” Id., at 199 (White, J., concurring). See\nalso United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U. S. 371, 378\n(1952) (applying antitrust scrutiny to patent settlement);\nStandard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 283 U. S. 163\n(1931) (same).\n   Similarly, both within the settlement context and with­\nout, the Court has struck down overly restrictive patent\nlicensing agreements—irrespective of whether those\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagreements produced supra-patent-permitted revenues.\nWe concede that in United States v. General Elec. Co., 272\nU. S. 476, 489 (1926), the Court permitted a single patentee\nto grant to a single licensee a license containing a mini­\nmum resale price requirement. But in Line Material,\nsupra, at 308, 310–311, the Court held that the antitrust\nlaws forbid a group of patentees, each owning one or more\npatents, to cross-license each other, and, in doing so, to\ninsist that each licensee maintain retail prices set collec­\ntively by the patent holders. The Court was willing to\npresume that the single-patentee practice approved in\nGeneral Electric was a “reasonable restraint” that “accords\nwith the patent monopoly granted by the patent law,” 333\nU. S., at 312, but declined to extend that conclusion to\nmultiple-patentee agreements: “As the Sherman Act pro­\nhibits agreements to fix prices, any arrangement between\npatentees runs afoul of that prohibition and is outside the\npatent monopoly.” Ibid. In New Wrinkle, 342 U. S., at\n378, the Court held roughly the same, this time in respect\nto a similar arrangement in settlement of a litigation\nbetween two patentees, each of which contended that its\nown patent gave it the exclusive right to control produc­\ntion. That one or the other company (we may presume)\nwas right about its patent did not lead the Court to confer\nantitrust immunity. Far from it, the agreement was found\nto violate the Sherman Act. Id., at 380.\n   Finally in Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), the Court upheld\ncross-licensing agreements among patentees that settled\nactual and impending patent litigation, 283 U. S., at 168,\nwhich agreements set royalty rates to be charged third\nparties for a license to practice all the patents at issue\n(and which divided resulting revenues). But, in doing so,\nJustice Brandeis, writing for the Court, warned that such\nan arrangement would have violated the Sherman Act had\nthe patent holders thereby “dominate[d]” the industry and\n“curtail[ed] the manufacture and supply of an unpatented\n12                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproduct.” Id., at 174. These cases do not simply ask\nwhether a hypothetically valid patent’s holder would be\nable to charge, e.g., the high prices that the challenged\npatent-related term allowed. Rather, they seek to ac­\ncommodate patent and antitrust policies, finding chal­\nlenged terms and conditions unlawful unless patent law\npolicy offsets the antitrust law policy strongly favoring\ncompetition.\n  Thus, contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 4–6,\nthere is nothing novel about our approach. What does\nappear novel are the dissent’s suggestions that a patent\nholder may simply “pa[y] a competitor to respect its pa­\ntent” and quit its patent invalidity or noninfringement\nclaim without any antitrust scrutiny whatever, post, at 3,\nand that “such settlements . . . are a well-known feature of\nintellectual property litigation,” post, at 10. Closer exami­\nnation casts doubt on these claims. The dissent does not\nidentify any patent statute that it understands to grant\nsuch a right to a patentee, whether expressly or by fair\nimplication. It would be difficult to reconcile the proposed\nright with the patent-related policy of eliminating unwar­\nranted patent grants so the public will not “continually be\nrequired to pay tribute to would-be monopolists without\nneed or justification.” Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653,\n670 (1969). And the authorities cited for this proposition\n(none from this Court, and none an antitrust case) are not\non point. Some of them say that when Company A sues\nCompany B for patent infringement and demands, say,\n$100 million in damages, it is not uncommon for B (the\ndefendant) to pay A (the plaintiff) some amount less than\nthe full demand as part of the settlement—$40 million, for\nexample. See Schildkraut, Patent-Splitting Settlements\nand the Reverse Payment Fallacy, 71 Antitrust L. J. 1033,\n1046 (2004) (suggesting that this hypothetical settlement\nincludes “an implicit net payment” from A to B of $60\nmillion—i.e., the amount of the settlement discount). The\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncited authorities also indicate that if B has a counterclaim\nfor damages against A, the original infringement plaintiff,\nA might end up paying B to settle B’s counterclaim. Cf.\nMetro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prods., Inc., 183\nF. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 1999) (describing trademark dispute and\nsettlement). Insofar as the dissent urges that settlements\ntaking these commonplace forms have not been thought\nfor that reason alone subject to antitrust liability, we\nagree, and do not intend to alter that understanding. But\nthe dissent appears also to suggest that reverse payment\nsettlements—e.g., in which A, the plaintiff, pays money to\ndefendant B purely so B will give up the patent fight—\nshould be viewed for antitrust purposes in the same light\nas these familiar settlement forms. See post, at 9–10. We\ncannot agree. In the traditional examples cited above, a\nparty with a claim (or counterclaim) for damages receives\na sum equal to or less than the value of its claim. In\nreverse payment settlements, in contrast, a party with no\nclaim for damages (something that is usually true of a\nparagraph IV litigation defendant) walks away with money\nsimply so it will stay away from the patentee’s market.\nThat, we think, is something quite different. Cf. Verizon\nCommunications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko,\nLLP, 540 U. S. 398, 408 (2004) (“[C]ollusion” is “the su­\npreme evil of antitrust”).\n   Finally, the Hatch-Waxman Act itself does not embody a\nstatutory policy that supports the Eleventh Circuit’s view.\nRather, the general procompetitive thrust of the statute,\nits specific provisions facilitating challenges to a patent’s\nvalidity, see Part I–A, supra, and its later-added provi­\nsions requiring parties to a patent dispute triggered by a\nparagraph IV filing to report settlement terms to the FTC\nand the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,\nall suggest the contrary. See §§1112–1113, 117 Stat.\n2461–2462. Those interested in legislative history may\nalso wish to examine the statements of individual Mem­\n14                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbers of Congress condemning reverse payment settlements\nin advance of the 2003 amendments. See, e.g., 148 Cong.\nRec. 14437 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (“It was and is\nvery clear that the [Hatch-Waxman Act] was not designed\nto allow deals between brand and generic companies to\ndelay competition”); 146 Cong. Rec. 18774 (2000) (remarks\nof Rep. Waxman) (introducing bill to deter companies from\n“strik[ing] collusive agreements to trade multimillion dol­\nlar payoffs by the brand company for delays in the intro­\nduction of lower cost, generic alternatives”).\n                               B\n   The Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion finds some degree of\nsupport in a general legal policy favoring the settlement of\ndisputes. 677 F. 3d, at 1313–1314. See also Schering-\nPlough Corp. v. FTC, 402 F. 3d 1056, 1074–1075 (2005)\n(same); In re Tamoxifen Citrate, 466 F. 3d, at 202 (noting\npublic’s “ ‘strong interest in settlement’ ” of complex and\nexpensive cases). The Circuit’s related underlying practi­\ncal concern consists of its fear that antitrust scrutiny of\na reverse payment agreement would require the parties to\nlitigate the validity of the patent in order to demonstrate\nwhat would have happened to competition in the absence\nof the settlement. Any such litigation will prove time\nconsuming, complex, and expensive. The antitrust game,\nthe Circuit may believe, would not be worth that litigation\ncandle.\n   We recognize the value of settlements and the patent\nlitigation problem. But we nonetheless conclude that this\npatent-related factor should not determine the result here.\nRather, five sets of considerations lead us to conclude that\nthe FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove\nits antitrust claim.\n   First, the specific restraint at issue has the “potential\nfor genuine adverse effects on competition.” Indiana\nFederation of Dentists, 476 U. S., at 460–461 (citing 7\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nAreeda ¶1511, at 429 (1986)). The payment in effect\namounts to a purchase by the patentee of the exclusive\nright to sell its product, a right it already claims but would\nlose if the patent litigation were to continue and the pa­\ntent were held invalid or not infringed by the generic\nproduct. Suppose, for example, that the exclusive right to\nsell produces $50 million in supracompetitive profits per\nyear for the patentee. And suppose further that the pa­\ntent has 10 more years to run. Continued litigation, if\nit results in patent invalidation or a finding of nonin­\nfringement, could cost the patentee $500 million in lost\nrevenues, a sum that then would flow in large part to\nconsumers in the form of lower prices.\n   We concede that settlement on terms permitting the\npatent challenger to enter the market before the patent\nexpires would also bring about competition, again to the\nconsumer’s benefit. But settlement on the terms said by\nthe FTC to be at issue here—payment in return for stay­\ning out of the market—simply keeps prices at patentee-set\nlevels, potentially producing the full patent-related $500\nmillion monopoly return while dividing that return be­\ntween the challenged patentee and the patent challenger.\nThe patentee and the challenger gain; the consumer loses.\nIndeed, there are indications that patentees sometimes\npay a generic challenger a sum even larger than what the\ngeneric would gain in profits if it won the paragraph IV\nlitigation and entered the market. See Hemphill, 81 N. Y.\nU. L. Rev., at 1581. See also Brief for 118 Law, Econom­\nics, and Business Professors et al. as Amici Curiae 25\n(estimating that this is true of the settlement challenged\nhere). The rationale behind a payment of this size cannot\nin every case be supported by traditional settlement con­\nsiderations. The payment may instead provide strong\nevidence that the patentee seeks to induce the generic\nchallenger to abandon its claim with a share of its monop­\noly profits that would otherwise be lost in the competitive\n16                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarket.\n   But, one might ask, as a practical matter would the\nparties be able to enter into such an anticompetitive\nagreement? Would not a high reverse payment signal to\nother potential challengers that the patentee lacks confi­\ndence in its patent, thereby provoking additional challeng­\nes, perhaps too many for the patentee to “buy off?” Two\nspecial features of Hatch-Waxman mean that the an-\nswer to this question is “not necessarily so.” First, under\nHatch-Waxman only the first challenger gains the special\nadvantage of 180 days of an exclusive right to sell a gener­\nic version of the brand-name product. See Part I–A, su-\npra. And as noted, that right has proved valuable—\nindeed, it can be worth several hundred million dollars.\nSee Hemphill, supra, at 1579; Brief for Petitioner 6. Sub­\nsequent challengers cannot secure that exclusivity period,\nand thus stand to win significantly less than the first if\nthey bring a successful paragraph IV challenge. That is, if\nsubsequent litigation results in invalidation of the patent,\nor a ruling that the patent is not infringed, that litigation\nvictory will free not just the challenger to compete, but all\nother potential competitors too (once they obtain FDA\napproval). The potential reward available to a subsequent\nchallenger being significantly less, the patentee’s payment\nto the initial challenger (in return for not pressing the\npatent challenge) will not necessarily provoke subsequent\nchallenges. Second, a generic that files a paragraph IV\nafter learning that the first filer has settled will (if sued by\nthe brand-name) have to wait out a stay period of (roughly)\n30 months before the FDA may approve its application,\njust as the first filer did. See 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iii).\nThese features together mean that a reverse payment\nsettlement with the first filer (or, as in this case, all of the\ninitial filers) “removes from consideration the most moti­\nvated challenger, and the one closest to introducing com­\npetition.” Hemphill, supra, at 1586. The dissent may\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndoubt these provisions matter, post, at 15–17, but scholars\nin the field tell us that “where only one party owns a\npatent, it is virtually unheard of outside of pharmaceuti­\ncals for that party to pay an accused infringer to settle the\nlawsuit.” 1 H. Hovenkamp, M. Janis, M. Lemley, & C.\nLeslie, IP and Antitrust §15.3, p. 15–45, n. 161 (2d ed.\nSupp. 2011). It may well be that Hatch-Waxman’s unique\nregulatory framework, including the special advantage\nthat the 180-day exclusivity period gives to first filers,\ndoes much to explain why in this context, but not others,\nthe patentee’s ordinary incentives to resist paying off\nchallengers (i.e., the fear of provoking myriad other chal­\nlengers) appear to be more frequently overcome. See 12\nAreeda ¶2046, at 341 (3d ed. 2010) (noting that these\nprovisions, no doubt unintentionally, have created special\nincentives for collusion).\n   Second, these anticompetitive consequences will at least\nsometimes prove unjustified. See 7 id., ¶1504, at 410–415\n(3d ed. 2010); California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 526 U. S.,\n756, 786–787 (1999) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). As the FTC admits, offsetting or re-\ndeeming virtues are sometimes present. Brief for Peti­\ntioner 37–39. The reverse payment, for example, may\namount to no more than a rough approximation of the\nlitigation expenses saved through the settlement. That\npayment may reflect compensation for other services that\nthe generic has promised to perform—such as distributing\nthe patented item or helping to develop a market for that\nitem. There may be other justifications. Where a reverse\npayment reflects traditional settlement considerations,\nsuch as avoided litigation costs or fair value for services,\nthere is not the same concern that a patentee is using its\nmonopoly profits to avoid the risk of patent invalidation or\na finding of noninfringement. In such cases, the parties\nmay have provided for a reverse payment without having\nsought or brought about the anticompetitive consequences\n18                 FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe mentioned above. But that possibility does not justify\ndismissing the FTC’s complaint. An antitrust defendant\nmay show in the antitrust proceeding that legitimate\njustifications are present, thereby explaining the presence\nof the challenged term and showing the lawfulness of that\nterm under the rule of reason. See, e.g., Indiana Federa-\ntion of Dentists, supra, at 459; 7 Areeda ¶¶1504a–1504b,\nat 401–404 (3d ed. 2010).\n   Third, where a reverse payment threatens to work\nunjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely pos­\nsesses the power to bring that harm about in practice.\nSee id., ¶1503, at 392–393. At least, the “size of the pay­\nment from a branded drug manufacturer to a prospective\ngeneric is itself a strong indicator of power”—namely, the\npower to charge prices higher than the competitive level.\n12 id., ¶2046, at 351. An important patent itself helps to\nassure such power. Neither is a firm without that power\nlikely to pay “large sums” to induce “others to stay out of\nits market.” Ibid. In any event, the Commission has\nreferred to studies showing that reverse payment agree­\nments are associated with the presence of higher-than­\ncompetitive profits—a strong indication of market power.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 45.\n   Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more fea-\nsible administratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed.\nThe Circuit’s holding does avoid the need to litigate the\npatent’s validity (and also, any question of infringement).\nBut to do so, it throws the baby out with the bath water,\nand there is no need to take that drastic step. That is\nbecause it is normally not necessary to litigate patent\nvalidity to answer the antitrust question (unless, perhaps,\nto determine whether the patent litigation is a sham, see\n677 F. 3d, at 1312). An unexplained large reverse pay­\nment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has\nserious doubts about the patent’s survival. And that fact,\nin turn, suggests that the payment’s objective is to main­\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntain supracompetitive prices to be shared among the\npatentee and the challenger rather than face what might\nhave been a competitive market—the very anticompetitive\nconsequence that underlies the claim of antitrust unlaw­\nfulness. The owner of a particularly valuable patent\nmight contend, of course, that even a small risk of invalid­\nity justifies a large payment. But, be that as it may, the\npayment (if otherwise unexplained) likely seeks to prevent\nthe risk of competition. And, as we have said, that conse­\nquence constitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm. In\na word, the size of the unexplained reverse payment can\nprovide a workable surrogate for a patent’s weakness, all\nwithout forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of\nthe validity of the patent itself. 12 Areeda ¶2046, at 350–\n352.\n   Fifth, the fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment\nrisks antitrust liability does not prevent litigating parties\nfrom settling their lawsuit. They may, as in other indus­\ntries, settle in other ways, for example, by allowing the\ngeneric manufacturer to enter the patentee’s market prior\nto the patent’s expiration, without the patentee paying\nthe challenger to stay out prior to that point. Although the\nparties may have reasons to prefer settlements that in­\nclude reverse payments, the relevant antitrust question is:\nWhat are those reasons? If the basic reason is a desire to\nmaintain and to share patent-generated monopoly profits,\nthen, in the absence of some other justification, the anti­\ntrust laws are likely to forbid the arrangement.\n   In sum, a reverse payment, where large and unjustified,\ncan bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive\neffects; one who makes such a payment may be unable to\nexplain and to justify it; such a firm or individual may\nwell possess market power derived from the patent; a\ncourt, by examining the size of the payment, may well be\nable to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with\nits potential justifications without litigating the validity of\n20                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe patent; and parties may well find ways to settle pa­\ntent disputes without the use of reverse payments. In\nour view, these considerations, taken together, outweigh\nthe single strong consideration—the desirability of\nsettlements—that led the Eleventh Circuit to provide\nnear-automatic antitrust immunity to reverse payment\nsettlements.\n                               III\n   The FTC urges us to hold that reverse payment settle­\nment agreements are presumptively unlawful and that\ncourts reviewing such agreements should proceed via a\n“quick look” approach, rather than applying a “rule of\nreason.” See California Dental, 526 U. S., at 775, n. 12\n(“Quick-look analysis in effect” shifts to “a defendant the\nburden to show empirical evidence of procompetitive\neffects”); 7 Areeda ¶1508, at 435–440 (3d ed. 2010). We\ndecline to do so. In California Dental, we held (unani­\nmously) that abandonment of the “rule of reason” in favor\nof presumptive rules (or a “quick-look” approach) is appro­\npriate only where “an observer with even a rudimentary\nunderstanding of economics could conclude that the ar­\nrangements in question would have an anticompetitive\neffect on customers and markets.” 526 U. S., at 770; id., at\n781 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). We do not believe that reverse payment settle­\nments, in the context we here discuss, meet this criterion.\n   That is because the likelihood of a reverse payment\nbringing about anticompetitive effects depends upon its\nsize, its scale in relation to the payor’s anticipated future\nlitigation costs, its independence from other services for\nwhich it might represent payment, and the lack of any\nother convincing justification. The existence and degree of\nany anticompetitive consequence may also vary as among\nindustries. These complexities lead us to conclude that\nthe FTC must prove its case as in other rule-of-reason\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

See 7 id.,\n¶1508c, at 438–440. We therefore leave to the lower\ncourts the structuring of the present rule-of-reason anti­\ntrust litigation. We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh\nCircuit.

It sued two\ngeneric drug manufacturers that it alleged were infringing\nthat patent. Those companies counterclaimed, contending\nthe patent was invalid and that, in any event, their prod-\nucts did not infringe. The parties litigated for three years\nbefore settling on these terms: Solvay agreed to pay the\ngenerics millions of dollars and to allow them into the\nmarket five years before the patent was set to expire; in\nexchange, the generics agreed to provide certain services\n(help with marketing and manufacturing) and to honor\nSolvay’s patent. The Federal Trade Commission alleges\nthat such a settlement violates the antitrust laws. The\nquestion is how to assess that claim.\n  A patent carves out an exception to the applicability of\nantitrust laws. The correct approach should therefore be\nto ask whether the settlement gives Solvay monopoly\npower beyond what the patent already gave it. The Court,\nhowever, departs from this approach, and would instead\nuse antitrust law’s amorphous rule of reason to inquire\ninto the anticompetitive effects of such settlements. This\nnovel approach is without support in any statute, and will\ndiscourage the settlement of patent litigation. I respect-\nfully dissent.\n2                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                                I\n\n   The point of antitrust law is to encourage competitive\nmarkets to promote consumer welfare. The point of patent\nlaw is to grant limited monopolies as a way of encouraging\ninnovation. Thus, a patent grants “the right to exclude\nothers from profiting by the patented invention.” Dawson\nChemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 215\n(1980). In doing so it provides an exception to antitrust\nlaw, and the scope of the patent—i.e., the rights conferred\nby the patent—forms the zone within which the patent\nholder may operate without facing antitrust liability.\n   This should go without saying, in part because we’ve\nsaid it so many times. Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v.\nFood Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 177\n(1965) (“ ‘A patent . . . is an exception to the general rule\nagainst monopolies’ ”); United States v. Line Material Co.,\n333 U. S. 287, 300 (1948) (“[T]he precise terms of the grant\ndefine the limits of a patentee’s monopoly and the area in\nwhich the patentee is freed from competition”); United\nStates v. General Elec. Co., 272 U. S. 476, 485 (1926) (“It is\nonly when . . . [the patentee] steps out of the scope of his\npatent rights” that he comes within the operation of the\nSherman Act); Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 377 U. S.\n13, 24 (1964) (similar). Thus, although it is per se unlaw-\nful to fix prices under antitrust law, we have long recog-\nnized that a patent holder is entitled to license a competi-\ntor to sell its product on the condition that the competitor\ncharge a certain, fixed price. See, e.g., General Elec. Co.,\nsupra, at 488–490.\n   We have never held that it violates antitrust law for a\ncompetitor to refrain from challenging a patent. And by\nextension, we have long recognized that the settlement of\npatent litigation does not by itself violate the antitrust\nlaws. Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 283\nU. S. 163, 171 (1931) (“Where there are legitimately con-\nflicting claims or threatened interferences, a settlement by\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nagreement, rather than litigation, is not precluded by the\n[Sherman] Act”). Like most litigation, patent litigation is\nsettled all the time, and such settlements—which can\ninclude agreements that clearly violate antitrust law, such\nas licenses that fix prices, or agreements among competi-\ntors to divide territory—do not ordinarily subject the\nlitigants to antitrust liability. See 1 H. Hovenkamp, M.\nJanis, M. Lemley, & C. Leslie, IP and Antitrust §7.3, pp.\n7–13 to 7–15 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter Hovenkamp).\n   The key, of course, is that the patent holder—when\ndoing anything, including settling—must act within the\nscope of the patent. If its actions go beyond the monopoly\npowers conferred by the patent, we have held that such\nactions are subject to antitrust scrutiny. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174, 196–197 (1963).\nIf its actions are within the scope of the patent, they are\nnot subject to antitrust scrutiny, with two exceptions\nconcededly not applicable here: (1) when the parties settle\nsham litigation, cf. Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, 60–61\n(1993); and (2) when the litigation involves a patent ob-\ntained through fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office.\nWalker Process Equipment, supra, at 177.\n   Thus, under our precedent, this is a fairly straight-\nforward case. Solvay paid a competitor to respect its\npatent—conduct which did not exceed the scope of its\npatent. No one alleges that there was sham litigation, or\nthat Solvay’s patent was obtained through fraud on the\nPTO. As in any settlement, Solvay gave its competitors\nsomething of value (money) and, in exchange, its competi-\ntors gave it something of value (dropping their legal\nclaims). In doing so, they put an end to litigation that had\nbeen dragging on for three years. Ordinarily, we would\nthink this a good thing.\n4                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                               II\n\n   Today, however, the Court announces a new rule. It is\nwilling to accept that Solvay’s actions did not exceed the\nscope of its patent. Ante, at 8. But it does not agree that\nthis is enough to “immunize the agreement from antitrust\nattack.” Ibid. According to the majority, if a patent holder\nsettles litigation by paying an alleged infringer a “large\nand unjustified” payment, in exchange for having the\nalleged infringer honor the patent, a court should employ\nthe antitrust rule of reason to determine whether the\nsettlement violates antitrust law. Ante, at 19.\n   The Court’s justifications for this holding are unpersua-\nsive. First, the majority explains that “the patent here\nmay or may not be valid, and may or may not be in-\nfringed.” Ante, at 8. Because there is “uncertainty” about\nwhether the patent is actually valid, the Court says that\nany questions regarding the legality of the settlement\nshould be “measur[ed]” by “procompetitive antitrust poli-\ncies,” rather than “patent law policy.” Ante, at 9. This\nsimply states the conclusion. The difficulty with such an\napproach is that a patent holder acting within the scope of\nits patent has an obvious defense to any antitrust suit:\nthat its patent allows it to engage in conduct that would\notherwise violate the antitrust laws. But again, that’s the\nwhole point of a patent: to confer a limited monopoly. The\nproblem, as the Court correctly recognizes, is that we’re\nnot quite certain if the patent is actually valid, or if the\ncompetitor is infringing it. But that is always the case,\nand is plainly a question of patent law.\n   The majority, however, would assess those patent law\nissues according to “antitrust policies.” According to the\nmajority, this is what the Court did in Line Material—i.e.,\nit “accommodat[ed]” antitrust principles and struck a\n“balance” between patent and antitrust law. Ante, at 9.\nBut the Court in Line Material did no such thing. Rather,\nit explained that it is “well settled that the possession of a\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nvalid patent or patents does not give the patentee any\nexemption from the provisions of the Sherman Act beyond\nthe limits of the patent monopoly.” 333 U. S., at 308 (em-\nphasis added). It then, in the very next sentence, stated\nthat “[b]y aggregating patents in one control, the holder of\nthe patents cannot escape the prohibitions of the Sherman\nAct.” Ibid. That second sentence follows only if such\nconduct—the aggregation of multiple patents—goes “be-\nyond the limits of the patent monopoly,” which is precisely\nwhat the Court concluded. See id., at 312 (“There is no\nsuggestion in the patent statutes of authority to combine\nwith other patent owners to fix prices on articles covered\nby the respective patents” (emphasis added)). The Court\nstressed, over and over, that a patent holder does not\nviolate the antitrust laws when it acts within the scope of\nits patent. See id., at 305 (“Within the limits of the pa-\ntentee’s rights under his patent, monopoly of the process\nor product by him is authorized by the patent statutes”);\nid., at 310 (“price limitations on patented devices beyond\nthe limits of a patent monopoly violate the Sherman Act”\n(emphasis added)).\n     The majority suggests that “[w]hether a particular\nrestraint lies ‘beyond the limits of the patent monopoly’ is\na conclusion that flows from” applying traditional anti-\ntrust principles. Ante, at 10. It seems to have in mind a\nregime where courts ignore the patent, and simply conduct\nan antitrust analysis of the settlement without regard to\nthe validity of the patent. But a patent holder acting\nwithin the scope of its patent does not engage in any un-\nlawful anticompetitive behavior; it is simply exercising the\nmonopoly rights granted to it by the Government. Its\nbehavior would be unlawful only if its patent were invalid\nor not infringed. And the scope of the patent—i.e., what\nrights are conferred by the patent—should be determined\nby reference to patent law. While it is conceivable to set\nup a legal system where you assess the validity of patents\n6                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nor questions of infringement by bringing an antitrust suit,\nneither the majority nor the Government suggests that\nCongress has done so.\n   Second, the majority contends that “this Court’s prece-\ndents make clear that patent-related settlement agree-\nments can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.” Ante, at\n10. For this carefully worded proposition, it cites Singer\nManufacturing Co., United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc.,\n342 U. S. 371 (1952), and Standard Oil Co. (Indiana). But\neach of those cases stands for the same, uncontroversial\npoint: that when a patent holder acts outside the scope of\nits patent, it is no longer protected from antitrust scrutiny\nby the patent.\n   To begin, the majority’s description of Singer is inaccu-\nrate. In Singer, several patent holders with competing\nclaims entered into a settlement agreement in which they\ncross-licensed their patents to each other, and did so in\norder to disadvantage Japanese competition. See 374\nU. S., at 194–195 (finding that the agreement had “a\ncommon purpose to suppress the Japanese machine com-\npetition in the United States” (footnote omitted)). Accord-\ning to the majority, the Court in Singer “did not examine\nwhether, on the assumption that all three patents were\nvalid, patent law would have allowed the patents’ hold-\ners to do the same.” Ante, at 10. Rather, the majority\ncontends, Singer held that this agreement violated the anti-\ntrust laws because “in important part . . . ‘the public inter-\nest in granting patent monopolies’ exists only to the extent\nthat ‘the public is given a novel and useful invention’ in\n‘consideration for its grant.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Singer, 374\nU. S., at 199 (White, J., concurring)). But the majority in\nSinger certainly did ask whether patent law permitted\nsuch an arrangement, concluding that it did not. See id.,\nat 196–197 (reiterating that it “is equally well settled that\nthe possession of a valid patent or patents does not give\nthe patentee any exemption from the provisions of the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nSherman Act beyond the limits of the patent monopoly”\nand holding that “those limitations have been exceeded in\nthis case” (emphasis added; internal quotation marks\nomitted)); see also Hovenkamp §7.2b, at 7–8, n. 15 (citing\nSinger as a quintessential case in which patent holders\nwere subject to antitrust liability because their settlement\nagreement went beyond the scope of their patents and\nthus conferred monopoly power beyond what the patent\nlawfully authorized). Even Justice White’s concurrence,\non which the majority relies, emphasized that the conduct\nat issue in Singer—collusion between patent holders to\nexclude Japanese competition and to prevent disclosure of\nprior art—was not authorized by the patent laws. 374\nU. S., at 197, 200.\n   New Wrinkle is to the same effect. There, the Court\nexplained that because “[p]rice control through cross-\nlicensing [is] barred as beyond the patent monopoly,” an\n“arrangement . . . made between patent holders to pool\ntheir patents and fix prices on the products for themselves\nand their licensees . . . plainly violate[s] the Sherman Act.”\n342 U. S., at 379, 380 (emphasis added). As the Court\nfurther explained, a patent holder may not, “ ‘acting in\nconcert with all members of an industry . . . issue substan-\ntially identical licenses to all members of the industry\nunder the terms of which the industry is completely regi-\nmented, the production of competitive unpatented prod-\nucts suppressed, a class of distributors squeezed out, and\nprices on unpatented products stabilized.’ ” Id., at 379–\n380 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n333 U. S. 364, 400 (1948)). The majority here, however,\nignores this discussion, and instead categorizes the case as\n“applying antitrust scrutiny to [a] patent settlement.”\nAnte, at 10.\n   Again, in Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), the parties settled\nclaims regarding “competing patented processes for manu-\nfacturing an unpatented product,” which threatened to\n8                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncreate a monopoly over the unpatented product. 283 U. S.,\nat 175. The Court explained that “an exchange of licenses\nfor the purpose of curtailing the . . . supply of an unpat-\nented product, is beyond the privileges conferred by the\npatents.” Id., at 174.\n   The majority is therefore right to suggest that these\n“precedents make clear that patent-related settlement\nagreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.”\nAnte, at 10 (emphasis added). The key word is sometimes.\nAnd those some times are spelled out in our prece-\ndents. Those cases have made very clear that patent\nsettlements—and for that matter, any agreements relating\nto patents—are subject to antitrust scrutiny if they confer\nbenefits beyond the scope of the patent. This makes sense.\nA patent exempts its holder from the antitrust laws only\ninsofar as the holder operates within the scope of the\npatent. When the holder steps outside the scope of the\npatent, he can no longer use the patent as his defense.\nThe majority points to no case where a patent settlement\nwas subject to antitrust scrutiny merely because the valid-\nity of the patent was uncertain. Not one. It is remarka-\nble, and surely worth something, that in the 123 years\nsince the Sherman Act was passed, we have never let\nantitrust law cross that Rubicon.\n   Next, the majority points to the “general procompetitive\nthrust” of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the fact that Hatch-\nWaxman “facilitat[es] challenges to a patent’s validity,”\nand its “provisions requiring parties to [such] patent\ndispute[s] . . . to report settlement terms to the FTC and\nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.”\nAnte, at 13. The Hatch-Waxman Act surely seeks to en-\ncourage competition in the drug market. And, like every\nlaw, it accomplishes its ends through specific provisions.\nThese provisions, for example, allow generic manufactur-\ners to enter the market without undergoing a duplicative\napplication process; they also grant a 180-day monopoly to\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe first qualifying generic to commercially market a\ncompeting product. See 21 U. S. C. §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv),\n355(j)(5)(B)(iv). So yes, the point of these provisions is to\nencourage competition. But it should by now be trite—and\nunnecessary—to say that “no legislation pursues its pur-\nposes at all costs” and that “it frustrates rather than\neffectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that\nwhatever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be\nthe law.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–\n526 (1987) (per curiam). It is especially disturbing here,\nwhere the Court discerns from specific provisions a very\nbroad policy—a “general procompetitive thrust,” in its\nwords—and uses that policy to unsettle the established\nrelationship between patent and antitrust law. Ante, at\n13. Indeed, for whatever it may be worth, Congress has\nrepeatedly declined to enact legislation addressing the\nissue the Court takes on today. See Brief for Actavis, Inc.\n57 (citing 11 such bills introduced in the House or Senate\nsince 2006).\n   In addition, it is of no consequence that settlement\nterms must be reported to the FTC and the Department of\nJustice. Such a requirement does not increase the role of\nantitrust law in scrutinizing patent settlements. Rather,\nit ensures that such terms are scrutinized consistent with\nexisting antitrust law. In other words, it ensures that the\nFTC and Antitrust Division can review the settlements to\nmake sure that they do not confer monopoly power beyond\nthe scope of the patent.\n   The majority suggests that “[a]pparently most if not all\nreverse payment settlement agreements arise in the con-\ntext of pharmaceutical drug regulation.” Ante, at 2. This\nclaim is not supported empirically by anything the majority\ncites, and seems unlikely. The term “reverse payment\nagreement”—coined to create the impression that such\nsettlements are unique—simply highlights the fact that\nthe party suing ends up paying. But this is no anomaly,\n10                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nnor is it evidence of a nefarious plot; it simply results from\nthe fact that the patent holder plaintiff is a defendant\nagainst an invalidity counterclaim—not a rare situation in\nintellectual property litigation. Whatever one might call\nthem, such settlements—paying an alleged infringer to\ndrop its invalidity claim—are a well-known feature of\nintellectual property litigation, and reflect an intuitive\nway to settle such disputes. See Metro-Goldwyn Mayer,\nInc. v. 007 Safety Prods., Inc., 183 F. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 1999);\nsee also Schildkraut, Patent-Splitting Settlements and\nthe Reverse Payment Fallacy, 71 Antitrust L. J. 1033,\n1033, 1046–1049 (2004); Brief for Actavis 54, n. 20 (citing\nexamples). To the extent there are not scores and scores\nof these settlements to point to, this is because such\nsettlements—outside the context of Hatch-Waxman—are\nprivate agreements that for obvious reasons are generally\nnot appealed, nor publicly available.\n    The majority suggests that reverse-payment agreements\nare distinct because “a party with no claim for damages\n. . . walks away with money simply so it will stay away\nfrom the patentee’s market.” Ante, at 13. Again a distinc-\ntion without a difference. While the alleged infringer may\nnot be suing for the patent holder’s money, it is suing for\nthe right to use and market the (intellectual) property,\nwhich is worth money.\n    Finally, the majority complains that nothing in “any\npatent statute” gives patent-holders the right to settle\nwhen faced with allegations of invalidity. Ante, at 12. But\nthe right to settle generally accompanies the right to\nlitigate in the first place; no one contends that drivers in\nan automobile accident may not settle their competing\nclaims merely because no statute grants them that author-\nity. The majority suggests that such a right makes it\nharder to “eliminat[e] unwarranted patent grants.” Ibid.\nThat may be so, but such a result—true of all patent\nsettlements—is no reason to adjudicate questions of pa-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntent law under antitrust principles. Our cases establish\nthat antitrust law has no business prying into a patent\nsettlement so long as that settlement confers to the patent\nholder no monopoly power beyond what the patent itself\nconferred—unless, of course, the patent was invalid, but\nthat again is a question of patent law, not antitrust law.\n  In sum, none of the Court’s reasons supports its conclu-\nsion that a patent holder, when settling a claim that its\npatent is invalid, is not immunized by the fact that it is\nacting within the scope of its patent. And I fear the\nCourt’s attempt to limit its holding to the context of patent\nsettlements under Hatch-Waxman will not long hold.\n                              III\n   The majority’s rule will discourage settlement of patent\nlitigation. Simply put, there would be no incentive to\nsettle if, immediately after settling, the parties would have\nto litigate the same issue—the question of patent validity—\nas part of a defense against an antitrust suit. In that suit,\nthe alleged infringer would be in the especially awkward\nposition of being for the patent after being against it.\n   This is unfortunate because patent litigation is particu-\nlarly complex, and particularly costly. As one treatise\nnoted, “[t]he median patent case that goes to trial costs\neach side $1.5 million in legal fees” alone. Hovenkamp\n§7.1c, at 7–5, n. 6. One study found that the cost of litiga-\ntion in this specific context—a generic challenging a brand\nname pharmaceutical patent—was about $10 million per\nsuit. See Herman, Note, The Stay Dilemma: Examining\nBrand and Generic Incentives for Delaying the Resolution\nof Pharmaceutical Patent Litigation, 111 Colum. L. Rev.\n1788, 1795, n. 41 (2011) (citing M. Goodman, G. Nachman,\n& L. Chen, Morgan Stanley Equity Research, Quantifying\nthe Impact from Authorized Generics 9 (2004)).\n   The Court acknowledges these problems but nonetheless\noffers “five sets of considerations” that it tells us overcome\n12                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthese concerns: (1) sometimes patent settlements will have\n“ ‘genuine adverse effects on competition’ ”; (2) “these anti-\ncompetitive consequences will at least sometimes prove\nunjustified”; (3) “where a reverse payment threatens to\nwork unjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely\npossesses the power to bring that harm about in practice”;\n(4) “it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity\nto answer the antitrust question” because “[a]n unex-\nplained large reverse payment itself would normally sug-\ngest that the patentee has serious doubts about the\npatent’s survival,” and using a “payment . . . to prevent the\nrisk of competition . . . constitutes the relevant anticom-\npetitive harm”; and (5) parties may still “settle in other\nways” such as “by allowing the generic manufacturer to\nenter the patentee’s market prior to the patent’s expira-\ntion, without the patentee paying the challenger to stay\nout prior to that point.” Ante, at 14–19 (emphasis added).\n    Almost all of these are unresponsive to the basic prob-\nlem that settling a patent claim cannot possibly impose\nunlawful anticompetitive harm if the patent holder is\nacting within the scope of a valid patent and therefore\npermitted to do precisely what the antitrust suit claims is\nunlawful. This means that in any such antitrust suit, the\ndefendant (patent holder) will want to use the validity of\nhis patent as a defense—in other words, he’ll want to say\n“I can do this because I have a valid patent that lets me do\nthis.” I therefore don’t see how the majority can conclude\nthat it won’t normally be “necessary to litigate patent\nvalidity to answer the antitrust question,” ante, at 18,\nunless it means to suggest that the defendant (patent\nholder) cannot raise his patent as a defense in an antitrust\nsuit. But depriving him of such a defense—if that’s what\nthe majority means to do—defeats the point of the patent,\nwhich is to confer a lawful monopoly on its holder.\n    The majority seems to think that even if the patent is\nvalid, a patent holder violates the antitrust laws merely\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nbecause the settlement took away some chance that his\npatent would be declared invalid by a court. See ante, at\n18–19 (“payment . . . to prevent the risk of competition . . .\nconstitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm” (emphasis\nadded)). This is flawed for several reasons.\n   First, a patent is either valid or invalid. The parties of\ncourse don’t know the answer with certainty at the outset\nof litigation; hence the litigation. But the same is true of\nany hard legal question that is yet to be adjudicated. Just\nbecause people don’t know the answer doesn’t mean there\nis no answer until a court declares one. Yet the majority\nwould impose antitrust liability based on the parties’\nsubjective uncertainty about that legal conclusion.\n   The Court does so on the assumption that offering a\n“large” sum is reliable evidence that the patent holder has\nserious doubts about the patent. Not true. A patent\nholder may be 95% sure about the validity of its patent,\nbut particularly risk averse or litigation averse, and will-\ning to pay a good deal of money to rid itself of the 5%\nchance of a finding of invalidity. What is actually motivat-\ning a patent holder is apparently a question district courts\nwill have to resolve on a case-by-case basis. The task of\ntrying to discern whether a patent holder is motivated by\nuncertainty about its patent, or other legitimate factors\nlike risk aversion, will be made all the more difficult by\nthe fact that much of the evidence about the party’s moti-\nvation may be embedded in legal advice from its attorney,\nwhich would presumably be shielded from discovery.\n   Second, the majority’s position leads to absurd results.\nLet’s say in 2005, a patent holder sues a competitor for\ninfringement and faces a counterclaim that its patent is\ninvalid. The patent holder determines that the risk of\nlosing on the question of validity is low, but after a year of\nlitigating, grows increasingly risk averse, tired of litiga-\ntion, and concerned about the company’s image, so it pays\nthe competitor a “large” payment, ante, at 18, in exchange\n14                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfor having the competitor honor its patent. Then let’s say\nin 2006, a different competitor, inspired by the first com-\npetitor’s success, sues the patent holder and seeks a simi-\nlar payment. The patent holder, recognizing that this\ndynamic is unsustainable, litigates this suit to conclusion,\nall the way to the Supreme Court, which unanimously\ndecides the patent was valid. According to the majority,\nthe first settlement would violate the antitrust laws even\nthough the patent was ultimately declared valid, because\nthat first settlement took away some chance that the\npatent would be invalidated in the first go around. Under\nthis approach, a patent holder may be found liable under\nantitrust law for doing what its perfectly valid patent\nallowed it to do in the first place; its sin was to settle,\nrather than prove the correctness of its position by litigat-\ning until the bitter end.\n  Third, this logic—that taking away any chance that a\npatent will be invalidated is itself an antitrust problem—\ncannot possibly be limited to reverse-payment agreements,\nor those that are “large.” Ibid. The Government’s brief\nacknowledges as much, suggesting that if antitrust scru-\ntiny is invited for such cash payments, it may also be\nrequired for “other consideration” and “alternative arrange-\nments.” Brief for Petitioner 36, n. 7. For example, when a\npatent holder licenses its product to a licensee at a fixed\nmonopoly price, surely it takes away some chance that its\npatent will be challenged by that licensee. According to\nthe majority’s reasoning, that’s an antitrust problem that\nmust be analyzed under the rule of reason. But see Gen-\neral Elec. Co., 272 U. S., at 488 (holding that a patent\nholder may license its invention at a fixed price). Indeed,\nthe Court’s own solution—that patent holders should\nnegotiate to allow generics into the market sooner, rather\nthan paying them money—also takes away some chance\nthat the generic would have litigated until the patent was\ninvalidated.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   Thus, although the question posed by this case is fun-\ndamentally a question of patent law—i.e., whether Sol-\nvay’s patent was valid and therefore permitted Solvay to\npay competitors to honor the scope of its patent—the\nmajority declares that such questions should henceforth be\nscrutinized by antitrust law’s unruly rule of reason. Good\nluck to the district courts that must, when faced with a\npatent settlement, weigh the “likely anticompetitive ef-\nfects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially\noffsetting legal considerations present in the circumstanc-\nes.” Ante, at 9–10; but see Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v.\nlinkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. 438, 452 (2009)\n(“We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of clear\nrules in antitrust law”).\n                           IV\n  The majority invokes “procompetitive antitrust policies,”\nante, at 9, but misses the basic point that patent laws\npromote consumer interests in a different way, by pro-\nviding protection against competition. As one treatise\nexplains:\n    “The purpose of the rule of reason is to determine\n    whether, on balance, a practice is reasonably likely to\n    be anticompetitive or competitively harmless—that is,\n    whether it yields lower or higher marketwide output.\n    By contrast, patent policy encompasses a set of judg-\n    ments about the proper tradeoff between competition\n    and the incentive to innovate over the long run. Anti-\n    trust’s rule of reason was not designed for such judg-\n    ments and is not adept at making them.” Hovenkamp\n    §7.3, at 7–13 (footnote omitted).\n   The majority recognizes that “a high reverse payment”\nmay “signal to other potential challengers that the patentee\nlacks confidence in its patent, thereby provoking addi-\ntional challenges.” Ante, at 16. It brushes this off, how-\n16                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\never, because of two features of Hatch-Waxman that make\nit “ ‘not necessarily so.’ ” Ibid. First, it points out that the\nfirst challenger gets a 180-day exclusive period to market\na generic version of the brand name drug, and that subse-\nquent challengers cannot secure that exclusivity period—\nmeaning when the patent holder buys off the first challenger,\nit has bought off its most motivated competitor. There\nare two problems with this argument. First, according to\nthe Food and Drug Administration, all manufacturers\nwho file on the first day are considered “first applicants”\nwho share the exclusivity period. Thus, if ten gener-\nics file an application to market a generic drug on the\nfirst day, all will be considered “first applicants.” See 21\nU. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(bb); see also FDA, Guid-\nance for Industry: 180-Day Exclusivity When Multiple\nANDAs Are Submitted on the Same Day 4 (July 2003).\nThis is not an unusual occurrence. See Brief for Generic\nPharmaceutical Association as Amicus Curiae 23–24\n(citing FTC data indicating that some drugs “have been\nsubject to as many as sixteen first-day” generic applica-\ntions; that in 2005, the average number of first-day appli-\ncations per drug was 11; and that between 2002 and 2008,\nthe yearly average never dropped below three first-day\napplications per drug).\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the 180 days of exclu-\nsivity simply provides more incentive for generic challenges.\nEven if a subsequent generic would not be entitled to this\nadditional incentive, it will have as much or nearly as\nmuch incentive to challenge the patent as a potential\nchallenger would in any other context outside of Hatch-\nWaxman, where there is no 180-day exclusivity period.\nAnd a patent holder who gives away notably large sums of\nmoney because it is, as the majority surmises, concerned\nabout the strength of its patent, would be putting blood in\nwater where sharks are always near.\n   The majority also points to the fact that, under Hatch-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

J., dissenting\n\nWaxman, the FDA is enjoined from approving a generic’s\napplication to market a drug for 30 months if the brand\nname sues the generic for patent infringement within 45\ndays of that application being filed. Ante, at 16 (citing 21\nU. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iii)). According to the majority, this\nprovision will chill subsequent generics from challenging\nthe patent (because they will have to wait 30 months\nbefore receiving FDA approval to market their drug). But\nthis overlooks an important feature of the law: the FDA\nmay approve the application before the 30 months are up\n“if before the expiration of [the 30 months,] the district\ncourt decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed.”\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(I). And even if the FDA did not have to\nwait 30 months, it is far from clear that a generic would\nwant to market a drug prior to obtaining a judgment of\ninvalidity or noninfringement. Doing so may expose it to\nruinous liability for infringement.\n   The irony of all this is that the majority’s decision may\nvery well discourage generics from challenging pharma-\nceutical patents in the first place. Patent litigation is\ncostly, time consuming, and uncertain. See Cybor Corp. v.\nFAS Techs., Inc., 138 F. 3d 1448, 1476, n. 4 (CA Fed. 1998)\n(opinion of Rader, J.)

Generics “enter\nthis risky terrain only after careful analysis of the poten-\ntial gains if they prevail and the potential exposure if they\nlose.” Id., at 19. Taking the prospect of settlements off\nthe table—or limiting settlements to an earlier entry date\nfor the generic, which may still be many years in the\nfuture—puts a damper on the generic’s expected value\ngoing into litigation, and decreases its incentive to sue in\n18                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe first place. The majority assures us, with no support,\nthat everything will be okay because the parties can settle\nby simply negotiating an earlier entry date for the generic\ndrug manufacturer, rather than settling with money.\nAnte, at 17. But it’s a matter of common sense, confirmed\nby experience, that parties are more likely to settle when\nthey have a broader set of valuable things to trade. See\nBrief for Mediation and Negotiation Professionals as\nAmici Curiae 6–8.\n                               V\n   The majority today departs from the settled approach\nseparating patent and antitrust law, weakens the protec-\ntions afforded to innovators by patents, frustrates the\npublic policy in favor of settling, and likely undermines\nthe very policy it seeks to promote by forcing generics who\nstep into the litigation ring to do so without the prospect of\ncash settlements. I would keep things as they were and\nnot subject basic questions of patent law to an unbounded\ninquiry under antitrust law, with its treble damages and\nfamously burdensome discovery. See 15 U. S.

Argued March 25, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984\n  (Hatch-Waxman Act or Act) creates special procedures for identifying\n  and resolving patent disputes between brand-name and generic drug\n  manufacturers, one of which requires a prospective generic manufac-\n  turer to assure the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it will\n  not infringe the brand-name’s patents. One way to provide such as-\n  surance (the “paragraph IV” route) is by certifying that any listed,\n  relevant patent “is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufac-\n  ture, use, or sale” of the generic drug.                  21 U. S. C.\n  §355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV).\n    Respondent Solvay Pharmaceuticals obtained a patent for its ap-\n  proved brand-name drug AndroGel. Subsequently, respondents Ac-\n  tavis and Paddock filed applications for generic drugs modeled after\n  AndroGel and certified under paragraph IV that Solvay’s patent was\n  invalid and that their drugs did not infringe it. Solvay sued Actavis\n  and Paddock, claiming patent infringement.           See 35 U. S. C.\n  §271(e)(2)(A). The FDA eventually approved Actavis’ generic prod-\n  uct, but instead of bringing its drug to market, Actavis entered into a\n  “reverse payment” settlement agreement with Solvay, agreeing not to\n  bring its generic to market for a specified number of years and agree-\n  ing to promote AndroGel to doctors in exchange for millions of dol-\n  lars. Paddock made a similar agreement with Solvay, as did re-\n  spondent Par, another manufacturer aligned in the patent litigation\n  with Paddock.\n    The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed suit, alleging that re-\n  spondents violated §5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by un-\n  lawfully agreeing to abandon their patent challenges, to refrain from\n2                          FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    launching their low-cost generic drugs, and to share in Solvay’s mo-\n    nopoly profits. The District Court dismissed the complaint. The\n    Eleventh Circuit concluded that as long as the anticompetitive effects\n    of a settlement fall within the scope of the patent’s exclusionary po-\n    tential, the settlement is immune from antitrust attack. Noting that\n    the FTC had not alleged that the challenged agreements excluded\n    competition to a greater extent than would the patent, if valid, it af-\n    firmed the complaint’s dismissal. It further recognized that if parties\n    to this sort of case do not settle, a court might declare a patent inva-\n    lid. But since public policy favors the settlement of disputes, it held\n    that courts could not require parties to continue to litigate in order to\n    avoid antitrust liability.\nHeld: The Eleventh Circuit erred in affirming the dismissal of the\n FTC’s complaint. Pp. 8–21.\n    (a) Although the anticompetitive effects of the reverse settlement\n agreement might fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\n Solvay’s patent, this does not immunize the agreement from antitrust\n attack. For one thing, to refer simply to what the holder of a valid\n patent could do does not by itself answer the antitrust question.\n Here, the paragraph IV litigation put the patent’s validity and pre-\n clusive scope at issue, and the parties’ settlement—in which, the FTC\n alleges, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants millions to stay out\n of its market, even though the defendants had no monetary claim\n against the plaintiff—ended that litigation. That form of settlement\n is unusual, and there is reason for concern that such settlements\n tend to have significant adverse effects on competition. It would be\n incongruous to determine antitrust legality by measuring the settle-\n ment’s anticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy, and\n not against procompetitive antitrust policies as well. Both are rele-\n vant in determining the scope of monopoly and antitrust immunity\n conferred by a patent, see, e.g., United States v. Line Material Co.,\n 333 U. S. 287, 310, 311, and the antitrust question should be an-\n swered by considering traditional antitrust factors. For another\n thing, this Court’s precedents make clear that patent-related settle-\n ment agreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws. See, e.g.,\n United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174; United States v. New\n Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U. S. 371; Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United\n States, 283 U. S. 163. Finally, the Hatch-Waxman Act’s general pro-\n competitive thrust—facilitating challenges to a patent’s validity and\n requiring parties to a paragraph IV dispute to report settlement\n terms to federal antitrust regulators—suggests a view contrary to the\n Eleventh Circuit’s. Pp. 8–14.\n    (b) While the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion finds some support in a\n general legal policy favoring the settlement of disputes, its related\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nunderlying practical concern consists of its fear that antitrust scruti-\nny of a reverse payment agreement would require the parties to en-\ngage in time-consuming, complex, and expensive litigation to demon-\nstrate what would have happened to competition absent the\nsettlement. However, five sets of considerations lead to the conclu-\nsion that this concern should not determine the result here and that\nthe FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove its anti-\ntrust claim. First, the specific restraint at issue has the “potential for\ngenuine adverse effects on competition.” FTC v. Indiana Federation\nof Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 460–461. Payment for staying out of the\nmarket keeps prices at patentee-set levels and divides the benefit be-\ntween the patentee and the challenger, while the consumer loses.\nAnd two Hatch-Waxman Act features—the 180-day exclusive-right-\nto-sell advantage given to the first paragraph IV challenger to win\nFDA approval, §355(j)(5)(B)(iv), and the roughly 30-month period\nthat the subsequent manufacturers would be required to wait out be-\nfore winning FDA approval, §355(j)(5)(B)(iii)—mean that a reverse\nsettlement agreement with the first filer removes from consideration\nthe manufacturer most likely to introduce competition quickly. Se-\ncond, these anticompetitive consequences will at least sometimes\nprove unjustified. There may be justifications for reverse payment\nthat are not the result of having sought or brought about anticompet-\nitive consequences, but that does not justify dismissing the FTC’s\ncomplaint without examining the potential justifications. Third,\nwhere a reverse payment threatens to work unjustified anticompeti-\ntive harm, the patentee likely has the power to bring about that\nharm in practice. The size of the payment from a branded drug\nmanufacturer to a generic challenger is a strong indicator of such\npower. Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more feasible\nadministratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed. It is normally\nnot necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust ques-\ntion. A large, unexplained reverse payment can provide a workable\nsurrogate for a patent’s weakness, all without forcing a court to con-\nduct a detailed exploration of the patent’s validity. Fifth, the fact\nthat a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does\nnot prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuits. As in oth-\ner industries, they may settle in other ways, e.g., by allowing the ge-\nneric manufacturer to enter the patentee’s market before the patent\nexpires without the patentee’s paying the challenger to stay out prior\nto that point. Pp. 14–20.\n   (c) This Court declines to hold that reverse payment settlement\nagreements are presumptively unlawful. Courts reviewing such\nagreements should proceed by applying the “rule of reason,” rather\nthan under a “quick look” approach. See California Dental Assn. v.\n4                         FTC v.

Because the settlement requires the patentee to pay\nthe alleged infringer, rather than the other way around,\nthis kind of settlement agreement is often called a “reverse\npayment” settlement agreement. And the basic question\nhere is whether such an agreement can sometimes unrea­\nsonably diminish competition in violation of the antitrust\nlaws. See, e.g., 15 U. S. C. §1 (Sherman Act prohibition\nof “restraint[s] of trade or commerce”). Cf. Palmer v. BRG of\nGa., Inc., 498 U. S. 46 (1990) (per curiam) (invalidating\nagreement not to compete).\n   In this case, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed a Federal\nTrade Commission (FTC) complaint claiming that a par­\nticular reverse payment settlement agreement violated\nthe antitrust laws. In doing so, the Circuit stated that a\nreverse payment settlement agreement generally is “im­\n2                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive\neffects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\nthe patent.” FTC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 677\nF. 3d 1298, 1312 (2012). And since the alleged infringer’s\npromise not to enter the patentee’s market expired before\nthe patent’s term ended, the Circuit found the agreement\nlegal and dismissed the FTC complaint. Id., at 1315. In\nour view, however, reverse payment settlements such as\nthe agreement alleged in the complaint before us can some­\ntimes violate the antitrust laws. We consequently hold\nthat the Eleventh Circuit should have allowed the FTC’s\nlawsuit to proceed.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n  Apparently most if not all reverse payment settlement\nagreements arise in the context of pharmaceutical drug\nregulation, and specifically in the context of suits brought\nunder statutory provisions allowing a generic drug manu­\nfacturer (seeking speedy marketing approval) to challenge\nthe validity of a patent owned by an already-approved\nbrand-name drug owner. See Brief for Petitioner 29; 12 P.\nAreeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶2046, p. 338\n(3d ed. 2012) (hereinafter Areeda); Hovenkamp, Sensible\nAntitrust Rules for Pharmaceutical Competition, 39\nU.

That Act is commonly known as the Hatch-\nWaxman Act.\n  First, a drug manufacturer, wishing to market a new\nprescription drug, must submit a New Drug Application to\nthe federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\nundergo a long, comprehensive, and costly testing process,\nafter which, if successful, the manufacturer will receive\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarketing approval from the FDA. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(b)(1) (requiring, among other things, “full reports of\ninvestigations” into safety and effectiveness; “a full list\nof the articles used as components”; and a “full description”\nof how the drug is manufactured, processed, and packed).\n   Second, once the FDA has approved a brand-name drug\nfor marketing, a manufacturer of a generic drug can ob­\ntain similar marketing approval through use of abbrevi­\nated procedures. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a generic\nmanufacturer to file an Abbreviated New Drug Appli­\ncation specifying that the generic has the “same active\ningredients as,” and is “biologically equivalent” to, the al­\nready-approved brand-name drug. Caraco Pharmaceutical\nLaboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S, 566 U. S. ___, ___\n(2012) (slip op., at 2) (citing 21 U. S. C. §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii),\n(iv)). In this way the generic manufacturer can obtain\napproval while avoiding the “costly and time-consuming\nstudies” needed to obtain approval “for a pioneer drug.”\nSee Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U. S. 661,\n676 (1990). The Hatch-Waxman process, by allowing the\ngeneric to piggy-back on the pioneer’s approval efforts,\n“speed[s] the introduction of low-cost generic drugs to\nmarket,” Caraco, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 2), thereby\nfurthering drug competition.\n   Third, the Hatch-Waxman Act sets forth special pro­\ncedures for identifying, and resolving, related patent dis­\nputes. It requires the pioneer brand-name manufacturer\nto list in its New Drug Application the “number and the\nexpiration date” of any relevant patent. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(b)(1). And it requires the generic manufacturer in its\nAbbreviated New Drug Application to “assure the FDA”\nthat the generic “will not infringe” the brand-name’s pa­\ntents. See Caraco, supra, at___ (slip op., at 3).\n   The generic can provide this assurance in one of several\nways. See 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(2)(A)(vii). It can certify that\nthe brand-name manufacturer has not listed any rele-\n4                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nvant patents. It can certify that any relevant patents have\nexpired. It can request approval to market beginning\nwhen any still-in-force patents expire. Or, it can certify\nthat any listed, relevant patent “is invalid or will not be\ninfringed by the manufacture, use, or sale” of the drug\ndescribed in the Abbreviated New Drug Application. See\n§355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). Taking this last-mentioned route\n(called the “paragraph IV” route), automatically counts as\npatent infringement, see 35 U. S. C. §271(e)(2)(A) (2006\ned., Supp. V), and often “means provoking litigation.”\nCaraco, supra, at___ (slip op., at 5). If the brand-name\npatentee brings an infringement suit within 45 days, the\nFDA then must withhold approving the generic, usually\nfor a 30-month period, while the parties litigate patent\nvalidity (or infringement) in court. If the courts decide the\nmatter within that period, the FDA follows that determi­\nnation; if they do not, the FDA may go forward and give\napproval to market the generic product. See 21 U. S. C.\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iii).\n   Fourth, Hatch-Waxman provides a special incentive for\na generic to be the first to file an Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication taking the paragraph IV route. That ap-\nplicant will enjoy a period of 180 days of exclusivity (from\nthe first commercial marketing of its drug).              See\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (establishing exclusivity period). During\nthat period of exclusivity no other generic can compete\nwith the brand-name drug. If the first-to-file generic\nmanufacturer can overcome any patent obstacle and bring\nthe generic to market, this 180-day period of exclusivity\ncan prove valuable, possibly “worth several hundred mil­\nlion dollars.” Hemphill, Paying for Delay: Pharmaceutical\nPatent Settlement as a Regulatory Design Problem, 81\nN. Y. U. L. Rev. 1553, 1579 (2006). Indeed, the Generic\nPharmaceutical Association said in 2006 that the “ ‘vast\nmajority of potential profits for a generic drug manufac­\nturer materialize during the 180-day exclusivity period.’ ”\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBrief for Petitioner 6 (quoting statement). The 180-day ex-\nclusivity period, however, can belong only to the first\ngeneric to file. Should that first-to-file generic forfeit the\nexclusivity right in one of the ways specified by statute, no\nother generic can obtain it. See §355(j)(5)(D).\n                              B\n                               1\n   In 1999, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, a respondent here,\nfiled a New Drug Application for a brand-name drug called\nAndroGel. The FDA approved the application in 2000. In\n2003, Solvay obtained a relevant patent and disclosed that\nfact to the FDA, 677 F. 3d, at 1308, as Hatch-Waxman\nrequires. See §355(c)(2) (requiring, in addition, that FDA\nmust publish new patent information upon submission).\n   Later the same year another respondent, Actavis, Inc.\n(then known as Watson Pharmaceuticals), filed an Abbre­\nviated New Drug Application for a generic drug modeled\nafter AndroGel. Subsequently, Paddock Laboratories, also\na respondent, separately filed an Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication for its own generic product. Both Actavis and\nPaddock certified under paragraph IV that Solvay’s listed\npatent was invalid and their drugs did not infringe it. A\nfourth manufacturer, Par Pharmaceutical, likewise a re-\nspondent, did not file an application of its own but joined\nforces with Paddock, agreeing to share the patent litiga­\ntion costs in return for a share of profits if Paddock ob­\ntained approval for its generic drug.\n   Solvay initiated paragraph IV patent litigation against\nActavis and Paddock. Thirty months later the FDA ap­\nproved Actavis’ first-to-file generic product, but, in 2006,\nthe patent-litigation parties all settled. Under the terms\nof the settlement Actavis agreed that it would not bring its\ngeneric to market until August 31, 2015, 65 months before\nSolvay’s patent expired (unless someone else marketed a\ngeneric sooner). Actavis also agreed to promote AndroGel\n6                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto urologists. The other generic manufacturers made\nroughly similar promises. And Solvay agreed to pay mil­\nlions of dollars to each generic—$12 million in total to\nPaddock; $60 million in total to Par; and an estimated\n$19–$30 million annually, for nine years, to Actavis. See\nApp. 46, 49–50, Complaint ¶¶66, 77. The companies de-\nscribed these payments as compensation for other services\nthe generics promised to perform, but the FTC contends\nthe other services had little value. According to the FTC\nthe true point of the payments was to compensate the\ngenerics for agreeing not to compete against AndroGel\nuntil 2015. See id., at 50–53, Complaint ¶¶81–85.\n                              2\n   On January 29, 2009, the FTC filed this lawsuit against\nall the settling parties, namely, Solvay, Actavis, Paddock,\nand Par. The FTC’s complaint (as since amended) alleged\nthat respondents violated §5 of the Federal Trade Com­\nmission Act, 15 U. S. C. §45, by unlawfully agreeing “to\nshare in Solvay’s monopoly profits, abandon their patent\nchallenges, and refrain from launching their low-cost\ngeneric products to compete with AndroGel for nine\nyears.” App. 29, Complaint ¶5. See generally FTC v.\nIndiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 454 (1986)\n(Section 5 “encompass[es] . . . practices that violate the\nSherman Act and the other antitrust laws”). The District\nCourt held that these allegations did not set forth an\nantitrust law violation. In re Androgel Antitrust Litiga-\ntion (No. II), 687 F. Supp. 2d 1371, 1379 (ND Ga. 2010). It\naccordingly dismissed the FTC’s complaint. The FTC\nappealed.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed\nthe District Court. It wrote that “absent sham litigation\nor fraud in obtaining the patent, a reverse payment set­\ntlement is immune from antitrust attack so long as its\nanticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclu­\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsionary potential of the patent.” 677 F. 3d, at 1312. The\ncourt recognized that “antitrust laws typically prohibit\nagreements where one company pays a potential competi­\ntor not to enter the market.” Id., at 1307 (citing Valley\nDrug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 344 F. 3d 1294,\n1304 (CA11 2003)). See also Palmer, 498 U. S., at 50\n(agreement to divide territorial markets held “unlawful on\nits face”). But, the court found that “reverse payment\nsettlements of patent litigation presen[t] atypical cases\nbecause one of the parties owns a patent.” 677 F. 3d, at\n1307 (internal quotation marks and second alteration\nomitted). Patent holders have a “lawful right to exclude\nothers from the market,” ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted); thus a patent “conveys the right to cripple com­\npetition.” Id., at 1310 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court recognized that, if the parties to this sort of case\ndo not settle, a court might declare the patent invalid. Id.,\nat 1305. But, in light of the public policy favoring settle­\nment of disputes (among other considerations) it held that\nthe courts could not require the parties to continue to\nlitigate in order to avoid antitrust liability. Id., at 1313–\n1314.\n   The FTC sought certiorari. Because different courts\nhave reached different conclusions about the application of\nthe antitrust laws to Hatch-Waxman-related patent set­\ntlements, we granted the FTC’s petition. Compare, e.g.,\nid., at 1312 (case below) (settlements generally “immune\nfrom antitrust attack”); In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride\nAntitrust Litigation, 544 F. 3d 1323, 1332–1337 (CA Fed.\n2008) (similar); In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litiga-\ntion, 466 F. 3d 187, 212–213 (CA2 2006) (similar), with\nIn re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, 686 F. 3d 197, 214–218\n(CA3 2012) (settlements presumptively unlawful).\n8                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   Solvay’s patent, if valid and infringed, might have per­\nmitted it to charge drug prices sufficient to recoup the\nreverse settlement payments it agreed to make to its po­\ntential generic competitors. And we are willing to take\nthis fact as evidence that the agreement’s “anticompetitive\neffects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of\nthe patent.” 677 F. 3d, at 1312. But we do not agree that\nthat fact, or characterization, can immunize the agree­\nment from antitrust attack.\n   For one thing, to refer, as the Circuit referred, simply to\nwhat the holder of a valid patent could do does not by\nitself answer the antitrust question. The patent here may\nor may not be valid, and may or may not be infringed. “[A]\nvalid patent excludes all except its owner from the use of\nthe protected process or product,” United States v. Line\nMaterial Co., 333 U. S. 287, 308 (1948) (emphasis added).\nAnd that exclusion may permit the patent owner to charge\na higher-than-competitive price for the patented product.\nBut an invalidated patent carries with it no such right.\nAnd even a valid patent confers no right to exclude prod­\nucts or processes that do not actually infringe. The para­\ngraph IV litigation in this case put the patent’s validity at\nissue, as well as its actual preclusive scope. The parties’\nsettlement ended that litigation. The FTC alleges that in\nsubstance, the plaintiff agreed to pay the defendants many\nmillions of dollars to stay out of its market, even though\nthe defendants did not have any claim that the plaintiff\nwas liable to them for damages. That form of settlement\nis unusual. And, for reasons discussed in Part II–B,\ninfra, there is reason for concern that settlements tak­\ning this form tend to have significant adverse effects on\ncompetition.\n   Given these factors, it would be incongruous to deter­\nmine antitrust legality by measuring the settlement’s\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nanticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy,\nrather than by measuring them against procompetitive\nantitrust policies as well. And indeed, contrary to the\nCircuit’s view that the only pertinent question is whether\n“the settlement agreement . . . fall[s] within” the legiti­\nmate “scope” of the patent’s “exclusionary potential,” 677\nF. 3d, at 1309, 1312, this Court has indicated that patent\nand antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the\n“scope of the patent monopoly”—and consequently anti­\ntrust law immunity—that is conferred by a patent.\n   Thus, the Court in Line Material explained that “the\nimproper use of [a patent] monopoly,” is “invalid” under\nthe antitrust laws and resolved the antitrust question in\nthat case by seeking an accommodation “between the law-\nful restraint on trade of the patent monopoly and the\nillegal restraint prohibited broadly by the Sherman Act.”\n333 U. S., at 310. To strike that balance, the Court asked\nquestions such as whether “the patent statute specifically\ngives a right” to restrain competition in the manner chal­\nlenged; and whether “competition is impeded to a greater\ndegree” by the restraint at issue than other restraints\npreviously approved as reasonable. Id., at 311. See also\nUnited States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364,\n390–391 (1948) (courts must “balance the privileges of [the\npatent holder] and its licensees under the patent grants\nwith the prohibitions of the Sherman Act against combi-\nnations and attempts to monopolize”); Walker Process\nEquipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382\nU. S. 172, 174 (1965) (“[E]nforcement of a patent procured\nby fraud” may violate the Sherman Act). In short, rather\nthan measure the length or amount of a restriction solely\nagainst the length of the patent’s term or its earning\npotential, as the Court of Appeals apparently did here,\nthis Court answered the antitrust question by considering\ntraditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive\neffects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially\n10                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\noffsetting legal considerations present in the circumstances,\nsuch as here those related to patents. See Part II–B,\ninfra. Whether a particular restraint lies “beyond the\nlimits of the patent monopoly” is a conclusion that flows\nfrom that analysis and not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE sug­\ngests, its starting point. Post, at 3, 8 (dissenting opinion).\n   For another thing, this Court’s precedents make clear\nthat patent-related settlement agreements can sometimes\nviolate the antitrust laws. In United States v. Singer\nMfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174 (1963), for example, two sewing\nmachine companies possessed competing patent claims; a\nthird company sought a patent under circumstances where\ndoing so might lead to the disclosure of information that\nwould invalidate the other two firms’ patents. All three\nfirms settled their patent-related disagreements while\nassigning the broadest claims to the firm best able to\nenforce the patent against yet other potential competitors.\nId., at 190–192. The Court did not examine whether, on\nthe assumption that all three patents were valid, patent\nlaw would have allowed the patents’ holders to do the\nsame. Rather, emphasizing that the Sherman Act “im­\nposes strict limitations on the concerted activities in which\npatent owners may lawfully engage,” id., at 197, it held\nthat the agreements, although settling patent disputes,\nviolated the antitrust laws. Id., at 195, 197. And that, in\nimportant part, was because “the public interest in grant­\ning patent monopolies” exists only to the extent that “the\npublic is given a novel and useful invention” in “considera­\ntion for its grant.” Id., at 199 (White, J., concurring). See\nalso United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U. S. 371, 378\n(1952) (applying antitrust scrutiny to patent settlement);\nStandard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 283 U. S. 163\n(1931) (same).\n   Similarly, both within the settlement context and with­\nout, the Court has struck down overly restrictive patent\nlicensing agreements—irrespective of whether those\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nagreements produced supra-patent-permitted revenues.\nWe concede that in United States v. General Elec. Co., 272\nU. S. 476, 489 (1926), the Court permitted a single patentee\nto grant to a single licensee a license containing a mini­\nmum resale price requirement. But in Line Material,\nsupra, at 308, 310–311, the Court held that the antitrust\nlaws forbid a group of patentees, each owning one or more\npatents, to cross-license each other, and, in doing so, to\ninsist that each licensee maintain retail prices set collec­\ntively by the patent holders. The Court was willing to\npresume that the single-patentee practice approved in\nGeneral Electric was a “reasonable restraint” that “accords\nwith the patent monopoly granted by the patent law,” 333\nU. S., at 312, but declined to extend that conclusion to\nmultiple-patentee agreements: “As the Sherman Act pro­\nhibits agreements to fix prices, any arrangement between\npatentees runs afoul of that prohibition and is outside the\npatent monopoly.” Ibid. In New Wrinkle, 342 U. S., at\n378, the Court held roughly the same, this time in respect\nto a similar arrangement in settlement of a litigation\nbetween two patentees, each of which contended that its\nown patent gave it the exclusive right to control produc­\ntion. That one or the other company (we may presume)\nwas right about its patent did not lead the Court to confer\nantitrust immunity. Far from it, the agreement was found\nto violate the Sherman Act. Id., at 380.\n   Finally in Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), the Court upheld\ncross-licensing agreements among patentees that settled\nactual and impending patent litigation, 283 U. S., at 168,\nwhich agreements set royalty rates to be charged third\nparties for a license to practice all the patents at issue\n(and which divided resulting revenues). But, in doing so,\nJustice Brandeis, writing for the Court, warned that such\nan arrangement would have violated the Sherman Act had\nthe patent holders thereby “dominate[d]” the industry and\n“curtail[ed] the manufacture and supply of an unpatented\n12                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nproduct.” Id., at 174. These cases do not simply ask\nwhether a hypothetically valid patent’s holder would be\nable to charge, e.g., the high prices that the challenged\npatent-related term allowed. Rather, they seek to ac­\ncommodate patent and antitrust policies, finding chal­\nlenged terms and conditions unlawful unless patent law\npolicy offsets the antitrust law policy strongly favoring\ncompetition.\n  Thus, contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 4–6,\nthere is nothing novel about our approach. What does\nappear novel are the dissent’s suggestions that a patent\nholder may simply “pa[y] a competitor to respect its pa­\ntent” and quit its patent invalidity or noninfringement\nclaim without any antitrust scrutiny whatever, post, at 3,\nand that “such settlements . . . are a well-known feature of\nintellectual property litigation,” post, at 10. Closer exami­\nnation casts doubt on these claims. The dissent does not\nidentify any patent statute that it understands to grant\nsuch a right to a patentee, whether expressly or by fair\nimplication. It would be difficult to reconcile the proposed\nright with the patent-related policy of eliminating unwar­\nranted patent grants so the public will not “continually be\nrequired to pay tribute to would-be monopolists without\nneed or justification.” Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653,\n670 (1969). And the authorities cited for this proposition\n(none from this Court, and none an antitrust case) are not\non point. Some of them say that when Company A sues\nCompany B for patent infringement and demands, say,\n$100 million in damages, it is not uncommon for B (the\ndefendant) to pay A (the plaintiff) some amount less than\nthe full demand as part of the settlement—$40 million, for\nexample. See Schildkraut, Patent-Splitting Settlements\nand the Reverse Payment Fallacy, 71 Antitrust L. J. 1033,\n1046 (2004) (suggesting that this hypothetical settlement\nincludes “an implicit net payment” from A to B of $60\nmillion—i.e., the amount of the settlement discount). The\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncited authorities also indicate that if B has a counterclaim\nfor damages against A, the original infringement plaintiff,\nA might end up paying B to settle B’s counterclaim. Cf.\nMetro-Goldwyn Mayer, Inc. v. 007 Safety Prods., Inc., 183\nF. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 1999) (describing trademark dispute and\nsettlement). Insofar as the dissent urges that settlements\ntaking these commonplace forms have not been thought\nfor that reason alone subject to antitrust liability, we\nagree, and do not intend to alter that understanding. But\nthe dissent appears also to suggest that reverse payment\nsettlements—e.g., in which A, the plaintiff, pays money to\ndefendant B purely so B will give up the patent fight—\nshould be viewed for antitrust purposes in the same light\nas these familiar settlement forms. See post, at 9–10. We\ncannot agree. In the traditional examples cited above, a\nparty with a claim (or counterclaim) for damages receives\na sum equal to or less than the value of its claim. In\nreverse payment settlements, in contrast, a party with no\nclaim for damages (something that is usually true of a\nparagraph IV litigation defendant) walks away with money\nsimply so it will stay away from the patentee’s market.\nThat, we think, is something quite different. Cf. Verizon\nCommunications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko,\nLLP, 540 U. S. 398, 408 (2004) (“[C]ollusion” is “the su­\npreme evil of antitrust”).\n   Finally, the Hatch-Waxman Act itself does not embody a\nstatutory policy that supports the Eleventh Circuit’s view.\nRather, the general procompetitive thrust of the statute,\nits specific provisions facilitating challenges to a patent’s\nvalidity, see Part I–A, supra, and its later-added provi­\nsions requiring parties to a patent dispute triggered by a\nparagraph IV filing to report settlement terms to the FTC\nand the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,\nall suggest the contrary. See §§1112–1113, 117 Stat.\n2461–2462. Those interested in legislative history may\nalso wish to examine the statements of individual Mem­\n14                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbers of Congress condemning reverse payment settlements\nin advance of the 2003 amendments. See, e.g., 148 Cong.\nRec. 14437 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Hatch) (“It was and is\nvery clear that the [Hatch-Waxman Act] was not designed\nto allow deals between brand and generic companies to\ndelay competition”); 146 Cong. Rec. 18774 (2000) (remarks\nof Rep. Waxman) (introducing bill to deter companies from\n“strik[ing] collusive agreements to trade multimillion dol­\nlar payoffs by the brand company for delays in the intro­\nduction of lower cost, generic alternatives”).\n                               B\n   The Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion finds some degree of\nsupport in a general legal policy favoring the settlement of\ndisputes. 677 F. 3d, at 1313–1314. See also Schering-\nPlough Corp. v. FTC, 402 F. 3d 1056, 1074–1075 (2005)\n(same); In re Tamoxifen Citrate, 466 F. 3d, at 202 (noting\npublic’s “ ‘strong interest in settlement’ ” of complex and\nexpensive cases). The Circuit’s related underlying practi­\ncal concern consists of its fear that antitrust scrutiny of\na reverse payment agreement would require the parties to\nlitigate the validity of the patent in order to demonstrate\nwhat would have happened to competition in the absence\nof the settlement. Any such litigation will prove time\nconsuming, complex, and expensive. The antitrust game,\nthe Circuit may believe, would not be worth that litigation\ncandle.\n   We recognize the value of settlements and the patent\nlitigation problem. But we nonetheless conclude that this\npatent-related factor should not determine the result here.\nRather, five sets of considerations lead us to conclude that\nthe FTC should have been given the opportunity to prove\nits antitrust claim.\n   First, the specific restraint at issue has the “potential\nfor genuine adverse effects on competition.” Indiana\nFederation of Dentists, 476 U.

The payment in effect\namounts to a purchase by the patentee of the exclusive\nright to sell its product, a right it already claims but would\nlose if the patent litigation were to continue and the pa­\ntent were held invalid or not infringed by the generic\nproduct. Suppose, for example, that the exclusive right to\nsell produces $50 million in supracompetitive profits per\nyear for the patentee. And suppose further that the pa­\ntent has 10 more years to run. Continued litigation, if\nit results in patent invalidation or a finding of nonin­\nfringement, could cost the patentee $500 million in lost\nrevenues, a sum that then would flow in large part to\nconsumers in the form of lower prices.\n   We concede that settlement on terms permitting the\npatent challenger to enter the market before the patent\nexpires would also bring about competition, again to the\nconsumer’s benefit. But settlement on the terms said by\nthe FTC to be at issue here—payment in return for stay­\ning out of the market—simply keeps prices at patentee-set\nlevels, potentially producing the full patent-related $500\nmillion monopoly return while dividing that return be­\ntween the challenged patentee and the patent challenger.\nThe patentee and the challenger gain; the consumer loses.\nIndeed, there are indications that patentees sometimes\npay a generic challenger a sum even larger than what the\ngeneric would gain in profits if it won the paragraph IV\nlitigation and entered the market. See Hemphill, 81 N. Y.\nU. L. Rev., at 1581. See also Brief for 118 Law, Econom­\nics, and Business Professors et al. as Amici Curiae 25\n(estimating that this is true of the settlement challenged\nhere). The rationale behind a payment of this size cannot\nin every case be supported by traditional settlement con­\nsiderations. The payment may instead provide strong\nevidence that the patentee seeks to induce the generic\nchallenger to abandon its claim with a share of its monop­\noly profits that would otherwise be lost in the competitive\n16                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nmarket.\n   But, one might ask, as a practical matter would the\nparties be able to enter into such an anticompetitive\nagreement? Would not a high reverse payment signal to\nother potential challengers that the patentee lacks confi­\ndence in its patent, thereby provoking additional challeng­\nes, perhaps too many for the patentee to “buy off?” Two\nspecial features of Hatch-Waxman mean that the an-\nswer to this question is “not necessarily so.” First, under\nHatch-Waxman only the first challenger gains the special\nadvantage of 180 days of an exclusive right to sell a gener­\nic version of the brand-name product. See Part I–A, su-\npra. And as noted, that right has proved valuable—\nindeed, it can be worth several hundred million dollars.\nSee Hemphill, supra, at 1579; Brief for Petitioner 6. Sub­\nsequent challengers cannot secure that exclusivity period,\nand thus stand to win significantly less than the first if\nthey bring a successful paragraph IV challenge. That is, if\nsubsequent litigation results in invalidation of the patent,\nor a ruling that the patent is not infringed, that litigation\nvictory will free not just the challenger to compete, but all\nother potential competitors too (once they obtain FDA\napproval). The potential reward available to a subsequent\nchallenger being significantly less, the patentee’s payment\nto the initial challenger (in return for not pressing the\npatent challenge) will not necessarily provoke subsequent\nchallenges. Second, a generic that files a paragraph IV\nafter learning that the first filer has settled will (if sued by\nthe brand-name) have to wait out a stay period of (roughly)\n30 months before the FDA may approve its application,\njust as the first filer did. See 21 U. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iii).\nThese features together mean that a reverse payment\nsettlement with the first filer (or, as in this case, all of the\ninitial filers) “removes from consideration the most moti­\nvated challenger, and the one closest to introducing com­\npetition.” Hemphill, supra, at 1586. The dissent may\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Hovenkamp, M. Janis, M. Lemley, & C.\nLeslie, IP and Antitrust §15.3, p. 15–45, n. 161 (2d ed.\nSupp. 2011). It may well be that Hatch-Waxman’s unique\nregulatory framework, including the special advantage\nthat the 180-day exclusivity period gives to first filers,\ndoes much to explain why in this context, but not others,\nthe patentee’s ordinary incentives to resist paying off\nchallengers (i.e., the fear of provoking myriad other chal­\nlengers) appear to be more frequently overcome. See 12\nAreeda ¶2046, at 341 (3d ed. 2010) (noting that these\nprovisions, no doubt unintentionally, have created special\nincentives for collusion).\n   Second, these anticompetitive consequences will at least\nsometimes prove unjustified. See 7 id., ¶1504, at 410–415\n(3d ed. 2010); California Dental Assn. v. FTC, 526 U. S.,\n756, 786–787 (1999) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). As the FTC admits, offsetting or re-\ndeeming virtues are sometimes present. Brief for Peti­\ntioner 37–39. The reverse payment, for example, may\namount to no more than a rough approximation of the\nlitigation expenses saved through the settlement. That\npayment may reflect compensation for other services that\nthe generic has promised to perform—such as distributing\nthe patented item or helping to develop a market for that\nitem. There may be other justifications. Where a reverse\npayment reflects traditional settlement considerations,\nsuch as avoided litigation costs or fair value for services,\nthere is not the same concern that a patentee is using its\nmonopoly profits to avoid the risk of patent invalidation or\na finding of noninfringement. In such cases, the parties\nmay have provided for a reverse payment without having\nsought or brought about the anticompetitive consequences\n18                 FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwe mentioned above. But that possibility does not justify\ndismissing the FTC’s complaint. An antitrust defendant\nmay show in the antitrust proceeding that legitimate\njustifications are present, thereby explaining the presence\nof the challenged term and showing the lawfulness of that\nterm under the rule of reason. See, e.g., Indiana Federa-\ntion of Dentists, supra, at 459; 7 Areeda ¶¶1504a–1504b,\nat 401–404 (3d ed. 2010).\n   Third, where a reverse payment threatens to work\nunjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely pos­\nsesses the power to bring that harm about in practice.\nSee id., ¶1503, at 392–393. At least, the “size of the pay­\nment from a branded drug manufacturer to a prospective\ngeneric is itself a strong indicator of power”—namely, the\npower to charge prices higher than the competitive level.\n12 id., ¶2046, at 351. An important patent itself helps to\nassure such power. Neither is a firm without that power\nlikely to pay “large sums” to induce “others to stay out of\nits market.” Ibid. In any event, the Commission has\nreferred to studies showing that reverse payment agree­\nments are associated with the presence of higher-than­\ncompetitive profits—a strong indication of market power.\nSee Brief for Petitioner 45.\n   Fourth, an antitrust action is likely to prove more fea-\nsible administratively than the Eleventh Circuit believed.\nThe Circuit’s holding does avoid the need to litigate the\npatent’s validity (and also, any question of infringement).\nBut to do so, it throws the baby out with the bath water,\nand there is no need to take that drastic step. That is\nbecause it is normally not necessary to litigate patent\nvalidity to answer the antitrust question (unless, perhaps,\nto determine whether the patent litigation is a sham, see\n677 F. 3d, at 1312). An unexplained large reverse pay­\nment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has\nserious doubts about the patent’s survival. And that fact,\nin turn, suggests that the payment’s objective is to main­\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntain supracompetitive prices to be shared among the\npatentee and the challenger rather than face what might\nhave been a competitive market—the very anticompetitive\nconsequence that underlies the claim of antitrust unlaw­\nfulness. The owner of a particularly valuable patent\nmight contend, of course, that even a small risk of invalid­\nity justifies a large payment. But, be that as it may, the\npayment (if otherwise unexplained) likely seeks to prevent\nthe risk of competition. And, as we have said, that conse­\nquence constitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm. In\na word, the size of the unexplained reverse payment can\nprovide a workable surrogate for a patent’s weakness, all\nwithout forcing a court to conduct a detailed exploration of\nthe validity of the patent itself. 12 Areeda ¶2046, at 350–\n352.\n   Fifth, the fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment\nrisks antitrust liability does not prevent litigating parties\nfrom settling their lawsuit. They may, as in other indus­\ntries, settle in other ways, for example, by allowing the\ngeneric manufacturer to enter the patentee’s market prior\nto the patent’s expiration, without the patentee paying\nthe challenger to stay out prior to that point. Although the\nparties may have reasons to prefer settlements that in­\nclude reverse payments, the relevant antitrust question is:\nWhat are those reasons? If the basic reason is a desire to\nmaintain and to share patent-generated monopoly profits,\nthen, in the absence of some other justification, the anti­\ntrust laws are likely to forbid the arrangement.\n   In sum, a reverse payment, where large and unjustified,\ncan bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive\neffects; one who makes such a payment may be unable to\nexplain and to justify it; such a firm or individual may\nwell possess market power derived from the patent; a\ncourt, by examining the size of the payment, may well be\nable to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with\nits potential justifications without litigating the validity of\n20                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe patent; and parties may well find ways to settle pa­\ntent disputes without the use of reverse payments. In\nour view, these considerations, taken together, outweigh\nthe single strong consideration—the desirability of\nsettlements—that led the Eleventh Circuit to provide\nnear-automatic antitrust immunity to reverse payment\nsettlements.\n                               III\n   The FTC urges us to hold that reverse payment settle­\nment agreements are presumptively unlawful and that\ncourts reviewing such agreements should proceed via a\n“quick look” approach, rather than applying a “rule of\nreason.” See California Dental, 526 U. S., at 775, n. 12\n(“Quick-look analysis in effect” shifts to “a defendant the\nburden to show empirical evidence of procompetitive\neffects”); 7 Areeda ¶1508, at 435–440 (3d ed. 2010). We\ndecline to do so. In California Dental, we held (unani­\nmously) that abandonment of the “rule of reason” in favor\nof presumptive rules (or a “quick-look” approach) is appro­\npriate only where “an observer with even a rudimentary\nunderstanding of economics could conclude that the ar­\nrangements in question would have an anticompetitive\neffect on customers and markets.” 526 U. S., at 770; id., at\n781 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart). We do not believe that reverse payment settle­\nments, in the context we here discuss, meet this criterion.\n   That is because the likelihood of a reverse payment\nbringing about anticompetitive effects depends upon its\nsize, its scale in relation to the payor’s anticipated future\nlitigation costs, its independence from other services for\nwhich it might represent payment, and the lack of any\nother convincing justification. The existence and degree of\nany anticompetitive consequence may also vary as among\nindustries. These complexities lead us to conclude that\nthe FTC must prove its case as in other rule-of-reason\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases.\n  To say this is not to require the courts to insist, contrary\nto what we have said, that the Commission need litigate\nthe patent’s validity, empirically demonstrate the virtues\nor vices of the patent system, present every possible sup­\nporting fact or refute every possible pro-defense theory.\nAs a leading antitrust scholar has pointed out, “ ‘[t]here is\nalways something of a sliding scale in appraising reason­\nableness,’ ” and as such “ ‘the quality of proof required\nshould vary with the circumstances.’ ” California Dental,\nsupra, at 780 (quoting with approval 7 Areeda ¶1507, at\n402 (1986)).\n  As in other areas of law, trial courts can structure anti­\ntrust litigation so as to avoid, on the one hand, the use of\nantitrust theories too abbreviated to permit proper analy­\nsis, and, on the other, consideration of every possible\nfact or theory irrespective of the minimal light it may\nshed on the basic question—that of the presence of sig­\nnificant unjustified anticompetitive consequences. See 7 id.,\n¶1508c, at 438–440. We therefore leave to the lower\ncourts the structuring of the present rule-of-reason anti­\ntrust litigation. We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh\nCircuit. And we remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

It sued two\ngeneric drug manufacturers that it alleged were infringing\nthat patent. Those companies counterclaimed, contending\nthe patent was invalid and that, in any event, their prod-\nucts did not infringe. The parties litigated for three years\nbefore settling on these terms: Solvay agreed to pay the\ngenerics millions of dollars and to allow them into the\nmarket five years before the patent was set to expire; in\nexchange, the generics agreed to provide certain services\n(help with marketing and manufacturing) and to honor\nSolvay’s patent. The Federal Trade Commission alleges\nthat such a settlement violates the antitrust laws. The\nquestion is how to assess that claim.\n  A patent carves out an exception to the applicability of\nantitrust laws. The correct approach should therefore be\nto ask whether the settlement gives Solvay monopoly\npower beyond what the patent already gave it. The Court,\nhowever, departs from this approach, and would instead\nuse antitrust law’s amorphous rule of reason to inquire\ninto the anticompetitive effects of such settlements. This\nnovel approach is without support in any statute, and will\ndiscourage the settlement of patent litigation. I respect-\nfully dissent.\n2                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                                I\n\n   The point of antitrust law is to encourage competitive\nmarkets to promote consumer welfare. The point of patent\nlaw is to grant limited monopolies as a way of encouraging\ninnovation. Thus, a patent grants “the right to exclude\nothers from profiting by the patented invention.” Dawson\nChemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 448 U. S. 176, 215\n(1980). In doing so it provides an exception to antitrust\nlaw, and the scope of the patent—i.e., the rights conferred\nby the patent—forms the zone within which the patent\nholder may operate without facing antitrust liability.\n   This should go without saying, in part because we’ve\nsaid it so many times. Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v.\nFood Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S. 172, 177\n(1965) (“ ‘A patent . . . is an exception to the general rule\nagainst monopolies’ ”); United States v. Line Material Co.,\n333 U. S. 287, 300 (1948) (“[T]he precise terms of the grant\ndefine the limits of a patentee’s monopoly and the area in\nwhich the patentee is freed from competition”); United\nStates v. General Elec. Co., 272 U. S. 476, 485 (1926) (“It is\nonly when . . . [the patentee] steps out of the scope of his\npatent rights” that he comes within the operation of the\nSherman Act); Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 377 U. S.\n13, 24 (1964) (similar). Thus, although it is per se unlaw-\nful to fix prices under antitrust law, we have long recog-\nnized that a patent holder is entitled to license a competi-\ntor to sell its product on the condition that the competitor\ncharge a certain, fixed price. See, e.g., General Elec. Co.,\nsupra, at 488–490.\n   We have never held that it violates antitrust law for a\ncompetitor to refrain from challenging a patent. And by\nextension, we have long recognized that the settlement of\npatent litigation does not by itself violate the antitrust\nlaws. Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) v. United States, 283\nU. S. 163, 171 (1931) (“Where there are legitimately con-\nflicting claims or threatened interferences, a settlement by\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Like most litigation, patent litigation is\nsettled all the time, and such settlements—which can\ninclude agreements that clearly violate antitrust law, such\nas licenses that fix prices, or agreements among competi-\ntors to divide territory—do not ordinarily subject the\nlitigants to antitrust liability. See 1 H. Hovenkamp, M.\nJanis, M. Lemley, & C. Leslie, IP and Antitrust §7.3, pp.\n7–13 to 7–15 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter Hovenkamp).\n   The key, of course, is that the patent holder—when\ndoing anything, including settling—must act within the\nscope of the patent. If its actions go beyond the monopoly\npowers conferred by the patent, we have held that such\nactions are subject to antitrust scrutiny. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U. S. 174, 196–197 (1963).\nIf its actions are within the scope of the patent, they are\nnot subject to antitrust scrutiny, with two exceptions\nconcededly not applicable here: (1) when the parties settle\nsham litigation, cf. Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.\nv. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49, 60–61\n(1993); and (2) when the litigation involves a patent ob-\ntained through fraud on the Patent and Trademark Office.\nWalker Process Equipment, supra, at 177.\n   Thus, under our precedent, this is a fairly straight-\nforward case. Solvay paid a competitor to respect its\npatent—conduct which did not exceed the scope of its\npatent. No one alleges that there was sham litigation, or\nthat Solvay’s patent was obtained through fraud on the\nPTO. As in any settlement, Solvay gave its competitors\nsomething of value (money) and, in exchange, its competi-\ntors gave it something of value (dropping their legal\nclaims). In doing so, they put an end to litigation that had\nbeen dragging on for three years. Ordinarily, we would\nthink this a good thing.\n4                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n\n                               II\n\n   Today, however, the Court announces a new rule. It is\nwilling to accept that Solvay’s actions did not exceed the\nscope of its patent. Ante, at 8. But it does not agree that\nthis is enough to “immunize the agreement from antitrust\nattack.” Ibid. According to the majority, if a patent holder\nsettles litigation by paying an alleged infringer a “large\nand unjustified” payment, in exchange for having the\nalleged infringer honor the patent, a court should employ\nthe antitrust rule of reason to determine whether the\nsettlement violates antitrust law. Ante, at 19.\n   The Court’s justifications for this holding are unpersua-\nsive. First, the majority explains that “the patent here\nmay or may not be valid, and may or may not be in-\nfringed.” Ante, at 8. Because there is “uncertainty” about\nwhether the patent is actually valid, the Court says that\nany questions regarding the legality of the settlement\nshould be “measur[ed]” by “procompetitive antitrust poli-\ncies,” rather than “patent law policy.” Ante, at 9. This\nsimply states the conclusion. The difficulty with such an\napproach is that a patent holder acting within the scope of\nits patent has an obvious defense to any antitrust suit:\nthat its patent allows it to engage in conduct that would\notherwise violate the antitrust laws. But again, that’s the\nwhole point of a patent: to confer a limited monopoly. The\nproblem, as the Court correctly recognizes, is that we’re\nnot quite certain if the patent is actually valid, or if the\ncompetitor is infringing it. But that is always the case,\nand is plainly a question of patent law.\n   The majority, however, would assess those patent law\nissues according to “antitrust policies.” According to the\nmajority, this is what the Court did in Line Material—i.e.,\nit “accommodat[ed]” antitrust principles and struck a\n“balance” between patent and antitrust law. Ante, at 9.\nBut the Court in Line Material did no such thing. Rather,\nit explained that it is “well settled that the possession of a\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nvalid patent or patents does not give the patentee any\nexemption from the provisions of the Sherman Act beyond\nthe limits of the patent monopoly.” 333 U. S., at 308 (em-\nphasis added). It then, in the very next sentence, stated\nthat “[b]y aggregating patents in one control, the holder of\nthe patents cannot escape the prohibitions of the Sherman\nAct.” Ibid. That second sentence follows only if such\nconduct—the aggregation of multiple patents—goes “be-\nyond the limits of the patent monopoly,” which is precisely\nwhat the Court concluded. See id., at 312 (“There is no\nsuggestion in the patent statutes of authority to combine\nwith other patent owners to fix prices on articles covered\nby the respective patents” (emphasis added)). The Court\nstressed, over and over, that a patent holder does not\nviolate the antitrust laws when it acts within the scope of\nits patent. See id., at 305 (“Within the limits of the pa-\ntentee’s rights under his patent, monopoly of the process\nor product by him is authorized by the patent statutes”);\nid., at 310 (“price limitations on patented devices beyond\nthe limits of a patent monopoly violate the Sherman Act”\n(emphasis added)).\n     The majority suggests that “[w]hether a particular\nrestraint lies ‘beyond the limits of the patent monopoly’ is\na conclusion that flows from” applying traditional anti-\ntrust principles. Ante, at 10. It seems to have in mind a\nregime where courts ignore the patent, and simply conduct\nan antitrust analysis of the settlement without regard to\nthe validity of the patent. But a patent holder acting\nwithin the scope of its patent does not engage in any un-\nlawful anticompetitive behavior; it is simply exercising the\nmonopoly rights granted to it by the Government. Its\nbehavior would be unlawful only if its patent were invalid\nor not infringed. And the scope of the patent—i.e., what\nrights are conferred by the patent—should be determined\nby reference to patent law. While it is conceivable to set\nup a legal system where you assess the validity of patents\n6                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nor questions of infringement by bringing an antitrust suit,\nneither the majority nor the Government suggests that\nCongress has done so.\n   Second, the majority contends that “this Court’s prece-\ndents make clear that patent-related settlement agree-\nments can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.” Ante, at\n10. For this carefully worded proposition, it cites Singer\nManufacturing Co., United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc.,\n342 U. S. 371 (1952), and Standard Oil Co. (Indiana). But\neach of those cases stands for the same, uncontroversial\npoint: that when a patent holder acts outside the scope of\nits patent, it is no longer protected from antitrust scrutiny\nby the patent.\n   To begin, the majority’s description of Singer is inaccu-\nrate. In Singer, several patent holders with competing\nclaims entered into a settlement agreement in which they\ncross-licensed their patents to each other, and did so in\norder to disadvantage Japanese competition. See 374\nU. S., at 194–195 (finding that the agreement had “a\ncommon purpose to suppress the Japanese machine com-\npetition in the United States” (footnote omitted)). Accord-\ning to the majority, the Court in Singer “did not examine\nwhether, on the assumption that all three patents were\nvalid, patent law would have allowed the patents’ hold-\ners to do the same.” Ante, at 10. Rather, the majority\ncontends, Singer held that this agreement violated the anti-\ntrust laws because “in important part . . . ‘the public inter-\nest in granting patent monopolies’ exists only to the extent\nthat ‘the public is given a novel and useful invention’ in\n‘consideration for its grant.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Singer, 374\nU. S., at 199 (White, J., concurring)). But the majority in\nSinger certainly did ask whether patent law permitted\nsuch an arrangement, concluding that it did not. See id.,\nat 196–197 (reiterating that it “is equally well settled that\nthe possession of a valid patent or patents does not give\nthe patentee any exemption from the provisions of the\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Even Justice White’s concurrence,\non which the majority relies, emphasized that the conduct\nat issue in Singer—collusion between patent holders to\nexclude Japanese competition and to prevent disclosure of\nprior art—was not authorized by the patent laws. 374\nU. S., at 197, 200.\n   New Wrinkle is to the same effect. There, the Court\nexplained that because “[p]rice control through cross-\nlicensing [is] barred as beyond the patent monopoly,” an\n“arrangement . . . made between patent holders to pool\ntheir patents and fix prices on the products for themselves\nand their licensees . . . plainly violate[s] the Sherman Act.”\n342 U. S., at 379, 380 (emphasis added). As the Court\nfurther explained, a patent holder may not, “ ‘acting in\nconcert with all members of an industry . . . issue substan-\ntially identical licenses to all members of the industry\nunder the terms of which the industry is completely regi-\nmented, the production of competitive unpatented prod-\nucts suppressed, a class of distributors squeezed out, and\nprices on unpatented products stabilized.’ ” Id., at 379–\n380 (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\n333 U. S. 364, 400 (1948)). The majority here, however,\nignores this discussion, and instead categorizes the case as\n“applying antitrust scrutiny to [a] patent settlement.”\nAnte, at 10.\n   Again, in Standard Oil Co. (Indiana), the parties settled\nclaims regarding “competing patented processes for manu-\nfacturing an unpatented product,” which threatened to\n8                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                  ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncreate a monopoly over the unpatented product. 283 U. S.,\nat 175. The Court explained that “an exchange of licenses\nfor the purpose of curtailing the . . . supply of an unpat-\nented product, is beyond the privileges conferred by the\npatents.” Id., at 174.\n   The majority is therefore right to suggest that these\n“precedents make clear that patent-related settlement\nagreements can sometimes violate the antitrust laws.”\nAnte, at 10 (emphasis added). The key word is sometimes.\nAnd those some times are spelled out in our prece-\ndents. Those cases have made very clear that patent\nsettlements—and for that matter, any agreements relating\nto patents—are subject to antitrust scrutiny if they confer\nbenefits beyond the scope of the patent. This makes sense.\nA patent exempts its holder from the antitrust laws only\ninsofar as the holder operates within the scope of the\npatent. When the holder steps outside the scope of the\npatent, he can no longer use the patent as his defense.\nThe majority points to no case where a patent settlement\nwas subject to antitrust scrutiny merely because the valid-\nity of the patent was uncertain. Not one. It is remarka-\nble, and surely worth something, that in the 123 years\nsince the Sherman Act was passed, we have never let\nantitrust law cross that Rubicon.\n   Next, the majority points to the “general procompetitive\nthrust” of the Hatch-Waxman Act, the fact that Hatch-\nWaxman “facilitat[es] challenges to a patent’s validity,”\nand its “provisions requiring parties to [such] patent\ndispute[s] . . . to report settlement terms to the FTC and\nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.”\nAnte, at 13. The Hatch-Waxman Act surely seeks to en-\ncourage competition in the drug market. And, like every\nlaw, it accomplishes its ends through specific provisions.\nThese provisions, for example, allow generic manufactur-\ners to enter the market without undergoing a duplicative\napplication process; they also grant a 180-day monopoly to\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthe first qualifying generic to commercially market a\ncompeting product. See 21 U. S. C. §§355(j)(2)(A)(ii), (iv),\n355(j)(5)(B)(iv). So yes, the point of these provisions is to\nencourage competition. But it should by now be trite—and\nunnecessary—to say that “no legislation pursues its pur-\nposes at all costs” and that “it frustrates rather than\neffectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that\nwhatever furthers the statute’s primary objective must be\nthe law.” Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525–\n526 (1987) (per curiam). It is especially disturbing here,\nwhere the Court discerns from specific provisions a very\nbroad policy—a “general procompetitive thrust,” in its\nwords—and uses that policy to unsettle the established\nrelationship between patent and antitrust law. Ante, at\n13. Indeed, for whatever it may be worth, Congress has\nrepeatedly declined to enact legislation addressing the\nissue the Court takes on today. See Brief for Actavis, Inc.\n57 (citing 11 such bills introduced in the House or Senate\nsince 2006).\n   In addition, it is of no consequence that settlement\nterms must be reported to the FTC and the Department of\nJustice. Such a requirement does not increase the role of\nantitrust law in scrutinizing patent settlements. Rather,\nit ensures that such terms are scrutinized consistent with\nexisting antitrust law. In other words, it ensures that the\nFTC and Antitrust Division can review the settlements to\nmake sure that they do not confer monopoly power beyond\nthe scope of the patent.\n   The majority suggests that “[a]pparently most if not all\nreverse payment settlement agreements arise in the con-\ntext of pharmaceutical drug regulation.” Ante, at 2. This\nclaim is not supported empirically by anything the majority\ncites, and seems unlikely. The term “reverse payment\nagreement”—coined to create the impression that such\nsettlements are unique—simply highlights the fact that\nthe party suing ends up paying. But this is no anomaly,\n10                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nnor is it evidence of a nefarious plot; it simply results from\nthe fact that the patent holder plaintiff is a defendant\nagainst an invalidity counterclaim—not a rare situation in\nintellectual property litigation. Whatever one might call\nthem, such settlements—paying an alleged infringer to\ndrop its invalidity claim—are a well-known feature of\nintellectual property litigation, and reflect an intuitive\nway to settle such disputes. See Metro-Goldwyn Mayer,\nInc. v. 007 Safety Prods., Inc., 183 F. 3d 10, 13 (CA1 1999);\nsee also Schildkraut, Patent-Splitting Settlements and\nthe Reverse Payment Fallacy, 71 Antitrust L. J. 1033,\n1033, 1046–1049 (2004); Brief for Actavis 54, n. 20 (citing\nexamples). To the extent there are not scores and scores\nof these settlements to point to, this is because such\nsettlements—outside the context of Hatch-Waxman—are\nprivate agreements that for obvious reasons are generally\nnot appealed, nor publicly available.\n    The majority suggests that reverse-payment agreements\nare distinct because “a party with no claim for damages\n. . . walks away with money simply so it will stay away\nfrom the patentee’s market.” Ante, at 13. Again a distinc-\ntion without a difference. While the alleged infringer may\nnot be suing for the patent holder’s money, it is suing for\nthe right to use and market the (intellectual) property,\nwhich is worth money.\n    Finally, the majority complains that nothing in “any\npatent statute” gives patent-holders the right to settle\nwhen faced with allegations of invalidity. Ante, at 12. But\nthe right to settle generally accompanies the right to\nlitigate in the first place; no one contends that drivers in\nan automobile accident may not settle their competing\nclaims merely because no statute grants them that author-\nity. The majority suggests that such a right makes it\nharder to “eliminat[e] unwarranted patent grants.” Ibid.\nThat may be so, but such a result—true of all patent\nsettlements—is no reason to adjudicate questions of pa-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntent law under antitrust principles. Our cases establish\nthat antitrust law has no business prying into a patent\nsettlement so long as that settlement confers to the patent\nholder no monopoly power beyond what the patent itself\nconferred—unless, of course, the patent was invalid, but\nthat again is a question of patent law, not antitrust law.\n  In sum, none of the Court’s reasons supports its conclu-\nsion that a patent holder, when settling a claim that its\npatent is invalid, is not immunized by the fact that it is\nacting within the scope of its patent. And I fear the\nCourt’s attempt to limit its holding to the context of patent\nsettlements under Hatch-Waxman will not long hold.\n                              III\n   The majority’s rule will discourage settlement of patent\nlitigation. Simply put, there would be no incentive to\nsettle if, immediately after settling, the parties would have\nto litigate the same issue—the question of patent validity—\nas part of a defense against an antitrust suit. In that suit,\nthe alleged infringer would be in the especially awkward\nposition of being for the patent after being against it.\n   This is unfortunate because patent litigation is particu-\nlarly complex, and particularly costly. As one treatise\nnoted, “[t]he median patent case that goes to trial costs\neach side $1.5 million in legal fees” alone. Hovenkamp\n§7.1c, at 7–5, n. 6. One study found that the cost of litiga-\ntion in this specific context—a generic challenging a brand\nname pharmaceutical patent—was about $10 million per\nsuit. See Herman, Note, The Stay Dilemma: Examining\nBrand and Generic Incentives for Delaying the Resolution\nof Pharmaceutical Patent Litigation, 111 Colum. L. Rev.\n1788, 1795, n. 41 (2011) (citing M. Goodman, G. Nachman,\n& L. Chen, Morgan Stanley Equity Research, Quantifying\nthe Impact from Authorized Generics 9 (2004)).\n   The Court acknowledges these problems but nonetheless\noffers “five sets of considerations” that it tells us overcome\n12                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nthese concerns: (1) sometimes patent settlements will have\n“ ‘genuine adverse effects on competition’ ”; (2) “these anti-\ncompetitive consequences will at least sometimes prove\nunjustified”; (3) “where a reverse payment threatens to\nwork unjustified anticompetitive harm, the patentee likely\npossesses the power to bring that harm about in practice”;\n(4) “it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity\nto answer the antitrust question” because “[a]n unex-\nplained large reverse payment itself would normally sug-\ngest that the patentee has serious doubts about the\npatent’s survival,” and using a “payment . . . to prevent the\nrisk of competition . . . constitutes the relevant anticom-\npetitive harm”; and (5) parties may still “settle in other\nways” such as “by allowing the generic manufacturer to\nenter the patentee’s market prior to the patent’s expira-\ntion, without the patentee paying the challenger to stay\nout prior to that point.” Ante, at 14–19 (emphasis added).\n    Almost all of these are unresponsive to the basic prob-\nlem that settling a patent claim cannot possibly impose\nunlawful anticompetitive harm if the patent holder is\nacting within the scope of a valid patent and therefore\npermitted to do precisely what the antitrust suit claims is\nunlawful. This means that in any such antitrust suit, the\ndefendant (patent holder) will want to use the validity of\nhis patent as a defense—in other words, he’ll want to say\n“I can do this because I have a valid patent that lets me do\nthis.” I therefore don’t see how the majority can conclude\nthat it won’t normally be “necessary to litigate patent\nvalidity to answer the antitrust question,” ante, at 18,\nunless it means to suggest that the defendant (patent\nholder) cannot raise his patent as a defense in an antitrust\nsuit. But depriving him of such a defense—if that’s what\nthe majority means to do—defeats the point of the patent,\nwhich is to confer a lawful monopoly on its holder.\n    The majority seems to think that even if the patent is\nvalid, a patent holder violates the antitrust laws merely\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nbecause the settlement took away some chance that his\npatent would be declared invalid by a court. See ante, at\n18–19 (“payment . . . to prevent the risk of competition . . .\nconstitutes the relevant anticompetitive harm” (emphasis\nadded)). This is flawed for several reasons.\n   First, a patent is either valid or invalid. The parties of\ncourse don’t know the answer with certainty at the outset\nof litigation; hence the litigation. But the same is true of\nany hard legal question that is yet to be adjudicated. Just\nbecause people don’t know the answer doesn’t mean there\nis no answer until a court declares one. Yet the majority\nwould impose antitrust liability based on the parties’\nsubjective uncertainty about that legal conclusion.\n   The Court does so on the assumption that offering a\n“large” sum is reliable evidence that the patent holder has\nserious doubts about the patent. Not true. A patent\nholder may be 95% sure about the validity of its patent,\nbut particularly risk averse or litigation averse, and will-\ning to pay a good deal of money to rid itself of the 5%\nchance of a finding of invalidity. What is actually motivat-\ning a patent holder is apparently a question district courts\nwill have to resolve on a case-by-case basis. The task of\ntrying to discern whether a patent holder is motivated by\nuncertainty about its patent, or other legitimate factors\nlike risk aversion, will be made all the more difficult by\nthe fact that much of the evidence about the party’s moti-\nvation may be embedded in legal advice from its attorney,\nwhich would presumably be shielded from discovery.\n   Second, the majority’s position leads to absurd results.\nLet’s say in 2005, a patent holder sues a competitor for\ninfringement and faces a counterclaim that its patent is\ninvalid. The patent holder determines that the risk of\nlosing on the question of validity is low, but after a year of\nlitigating, grows increasingly risk averse, tired of litiga-\ntion, and concerned about the company’s image, so it pays\nthe competitor a “large” payment, ante, at 18, in exchange\n14                  FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nfor having the competitor honor its patent. Then let’s say\nin 2006, a different competitor, inspired by the first com-\npetitor’s success, sues the patent holder and seeks a simi-\nlar payment. The patent holder, recognizing that this\ndynamic is unsustainable, litigates this suit to conclusion,\nall the way to the Supreme Court, which unanimously\ndecides the patent was valid. According to the majority,\nthe first settlement would violate the antitrust laws even\nthough the patent was ultimately declared valid, because\nthat first settlement took away some chance that the\npatent would be invalidated in the first go around. Under\nthis approach, a patent holder may be found liable under\nantitrust law for doing what its perfectly valid patent\nallowed it to do in the first place; its sin was to settle,\nrather than prove the correctness of its position by litigat-\ning until the bitter end.\n  Third, this logic—that taking away any chance that a\npatent will be invalidated is itself an antitrust problem—\ncannot possibly be limited to reverse-payment agreements,\nor those that are “large.” Ibid. The Government’s brief\nacknowledges as much, suggesting that if antitrust scru-\ntiny is invited for such cash payments, it may also be\nrequired for “other consideration” and “alternative arrange-\nments.” Brief for Petitioner 36, n. 7. For example, when a\npatent holder licenses its product to a licensee at a fixed\nmonopoly price, surely it takes away some chance that its\npatent will be challenged by that licensee. According to\nthe majority’s reasoning, that’s an antitrust problem that\nmust be analyzed under the rule of reason. But see Gen-\neral Elec. Co., 272 U. S., at 488 (holding that a patent\nholder may license its invention at a fixed price). Indeed,\nthe Court’s own solution—that patent holders should\nnegotiate to allow generics into the market sooner, rather\nthan paying them money—also takes away some chance\nthat the generic would have litigated until the patent was\ninvalidated.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   Thus, although the question posed by this case is fun-\ndamentally a question of patent law—i.e., whether Sol-\nvay’s patent was valid and therefore permitted Solvay to\npay competitors to honor the scope of its patent—the\nmajority declares that such questions should henceforth be\nscrutinized by antitrust law’s unruly rule of reason. Good\nluck to the district courts that must, when faced with a\npatent settlement, weigh the “likely anticompetitive ef-\nfects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially\noffsetting legal considerations present in the circumstanc-\nes.” Ante, at 9–10; but see Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v.\nlinkLine Communications, Inc., 555 U. S. 438, 452 (2009)\n(“We have repeatedly emphasized the importance of clear\nrules in antitrust law”).\n                           IV\n  The majority invokes “procompetitive antitrust policies,”\nante, at 9, but misses the basic point that patent laws\npromote consumer interests in a different way, by pro-\nviding protection against competition. As one treatise\nexplains:\n    “The purpose of the rule of reason is to determine\n    whether, on balance, a practice is reasonably likely to\n    be anticompetitive or competitively harmless—that is,\n    whether it yields lower or higher marketwide output.\n    By contrast, patent policy encompasses a set of judg-\n    ments about the proper tradeoff between competition\n    and the incentive to innovate over the long run. Anti-\n    trust’s rule of reason was not designed for such judg-\n    ments and is not adept at making them.” Hovenkamp\n    §7.3, at 7–13 (footnote omitted).\n   The majority recognizes that “a high reverse payment”\nmay “signal to other potential challengers that the patentee\nlacks confidence in its patent, thereby provoking addi-\ntional challenges.” Ante, at 16. It brushes this off, how-\n16                   FTC v. ACTAVIS, INC.\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\never, because of two features of Hatch-Waxman that make\nit “ ‘not necessarily so.’ ” Ibid. First, it points out that the\nfirst challenger gets a 180-day exclusive period to market\na generic version of the brand name drug, and that subse-\nquent challengers cannot secure that exclusivity period—\nmeaning when the patent holder buys off the first challenger,\nit has bought off its most motivated competitor. There\nare two problems with this argument. First, according to\nthe Food and Drug Administration, all manufacturers\nwho file on the first day are considered “first applicants”\nwho share the exclusivity period. Thus, if ten gener-\nics file an application to market a generic drug on the\nfirst day, all will be considered “first applicants.” See 21\nU. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(bb); see also FDA, Guid-\nance for Industry: 180-Day Exclusivity When Multiple\nANDAs Are Submitted on the Same Day 4 (July 2003).\nThis is not an unusual occurrence. See Brief for Generic\nPharmaceutical Association as Amicus Curiae 23–24\n(citing FTC data indicating that some drugs “have been\nsubject to as many as sixteen first-day” generic applica-\ntions; that in 2005, the average number of first-day appli-\ncations per drug was 11; and that between 2002 and 2008,\nthe yearly average never dropped below three first-day\napplications per drug).\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the 180 days of exclu-\nsivity simply provides more incentive for generic challenges.\nEven if a subsequent generic would not be entitled to this\nadditional incentive, it will have as much or nearly as\nmuch incentive to challenge the patent as a potential\nchallenger would in any other context outside of Hatch-\nWaxman, where there is no 180-day exclusivity period.\nAnd a patent holder who gives away notably large sums of\nmoney because it is, as the majority surmises, concerned\nabout the strength of its patent, would be putting blood in\nwater where sharks are always near.\n   The majority also points to the fact that, under Hatch-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

J., dissenting\n\nWaxman, the FDA is enjoined from approving a generic’s\napplication to market a drug for 30 months if the brand\nname sues the generic for patent infringement within 45\ndays of that application being filed. Ante, at 16 (citing 21\nU. S. C. §355(j)(5)(B)(iii)). According to the majority, this\nprovision will chill subsequent generics from challenging\nthe patent (because they will have to wait 30 months\nbefore receiving FDA approval to market their drug). But\nthis overlooks an important feature of the law: the FDA\nmay approve the application before the 30 months are up\n“if before the expiration of [the 30 months,] the district\ncourt decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed.”\n§355(j)(5)(B)(iii)(I). And even if the FDA did not have to\nwait 30 months, it is far from clear that a generic would\nwant to market a drug prior to obtaining a judgment of\ninvalidity or noninfringement. Doing so may expose it to\nruinous liability for infringement.\n   The irony of all this is that the majority’s decision may\nvery well discourage generics from challenging pharma-\nceutical patents in the first place. Patent litigation is\ncostly, time consuming, and uncertain. See Cybor Corp. v.\nFAS Techs., Inc., 138 F. 3d 1448, 1476, n. 4 (CA Fed. 1998)\n(opinion of Rader, J.) (en banc) (discussing study showing\nthat the Federal Circuit wholly or partially reversed in\nalmost 40 percent of claim construction appeals in a 30-\nmonth period); Brief for Generic Pharmaceutical Associa-\ntion as Amicus Curiae 16 (citing a 2010 study analyzing\nthe prior decade’s cases and showing that generics pre-\nvailed in 82 cases and lost in 89 cases). Generics “enter\nthis risky terrain only after careful analysis of the poten-\ntial gains if they prevail and the potential exposure if they\nlose.” Id., at 19. Taking the prospect of settlements off\nthe table—or limiting settlements to an earlier entry date\nfor the generic, which may still be many years in the\nfuture—puts a damper on the generic’s expected value\ngoing into litigation, and decreases its incentive to sue in\n18                  FTC v.

The majority assures us, with no support,\nthat everything will be okay because the parties can settle\nby simply negotiating an earlier entry date for the generic\ndrug manufacturer, rather than settling with money.\nAnte, at 17. But it’s a matter of common sense, confirmed\nby experience, that parties are more likely to settle when\nthey have a broader set of valuable things to trade. See\nBrief for Mediation and Negotiation Professionals as\nAmici Curiae 6–8.\n                               V\n   The majority today departs from the settled approach\nseparating patent and antitrust law, weakens the protec-\ntions afforded to innovators by patents, frustrates the\npublic policy in favor of settling, and likely undermines\nthe very policy it seeks to promote by forcing generics who\nstep into the litigation ring to do so without the prospect of\ncash settlements. I would keep things as they were and\nnot subject basic questions of patent law to an unbounded\ninquiry under antitrust law, with its treble damages and\nfamously burdensome discovery. See 15 U. S.
