Argued March 18, 2013\u2014Decided June 17, 2013\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires States to\n  \u201caccept and use\u201d a uniform federal form to register voters for federal\n  elections. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). That \u201cFederal Form,\u201d devel-\n  oped by the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC), requires\n  only that an applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a cit-\n  izen. Arizona law, however, requires voter-registration officials to\n  \u201creject\u201d any application for registration, including a Federal Form,\n  that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship. Re-\n  spondents, a group of individual Arizona residents and a group of\n  nonprofit organizations, sought to enjoin that Arizona law. Ultimate-\n  ly, the District Court granted Arizona summary judgment on re-\n  spondents\u2019 claim that the NVRA pre-empts Arizona\u2019s requirement.\n  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed as relevant here,\n  holding that the state law\u2019s documentary-proof-of-citizenship re-\n  quirement is pre-empted by the NVRA.\nHeld: Arizona\u2019s evidence-of-citizenship requirement, as applied to Fed-\n eral Form applicants, is pre-empted by the NVRA\u2019s mandate that\n States \u201caccept and use\u201d the Federal Form. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) The Elections Clause imposes on States the duty to prescribe\n the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Sena-\n tors, but it confers on Congress the power to alter those regulations\n or supplant them altogether.         See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v.\n Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 804\u2013805. This Court has said that the\n terms \u201cTimes, Places, and Manner\u201d \u201cembrace authority to provide a\n complete code for congressional elections,\u201d including regulations re-\n lating to \u201cregistration.\u201d Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366. Pp. 4\u20136.\n    (b) Because \u201caccept and use\u201d are words \u201cthat can have more than\n2        ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    one meaning,\u201d they \u201care given content . . . by their surroundings.\u201d\n    Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 466.\n    Reading \u201caccept\u201d merely to denote willing receipt seems out of place\n    in the context of an official mandate to accept and use something for\n    a given purpose. The implication of such a mandate is that its object\n    is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satis-\n    fy. Arizona\u2019s reading is also difficult to reconcile with neighboring\n    NVRA provisions, such as \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) and \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2).\n       Arizona\u2019s appeal to the presumption against pre-emption invoked\n    in this Court\u2019s Supremacy Clause cases is inapposite. The power the\n    Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt.\n    Because Congress, when it acts under this Clause, is always on notice\n    that its legislation will displace some element of a pre-existing legal\n    regime erected by the States, the reasonable assumption is that the\n    text of Elections Clause legislation accurately communicates the\n    scope of Congress\u2019s pre-emptive intent.\n       Nonetheless, while the NVRA forbids States to demand that an ap-\n    plicant submit additional information beyond that required by the\n    Federal Form, it does not preclude States from \u201cdeny[ing] registra-\n    tion based on information in their possession establishing the appli-\n    cant\u2019s ineligibility.\u201d Pp. 6\u201313.\n       (c) Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress\n    to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in\n    them. The latter is the province of the States. See U. S. Const., Art.\n    I, \u00a72, cl. 1; Amdt. 17. It would raise serious constitutional doubts if a\n    federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information nec-\n    essary to enforce its voter qualifications. The NVRA can be read to\n    avoid such a conflict, however. Section 1973gg\u20137(b)(1) permits the\n    EAC to include on the Federal Form information \u201cnecessary to enable\n    the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the\n    applicant.\u201d That validly conferred discretionary executive authority\n    is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to require the\n    inclusion of Arizona\u2019s concrete-evidence requirement if such evidence\n    is necessary to enable Arizona to enforce its citizenship qualification.\n       The NVRA permits a State to request the EAC to include state-\n    specific instructions on the Federal Form, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u2013\n    7(a)(2), and a State may challenge the EAC\u2019s rejection of that request\n    (or failure to act on it) in a suit under the Administrative Procedure\n    Act. That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to\n    determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.\n    Should the EAC reject or decline to act on a renewed request, Arizona\n    would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a\n    mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement\n    and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to in-\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

THE INTER \n\n     TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZONA, INC., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 17, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The National Voter Registration Act requires States to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d a uniform federal form to register voters\nfor federal elections. The contents of that form (colloquially\nknown as the Federal Form) are prescribed by a federal\nagency, the Election Assistance Commission. The Federal\nForm developed by the EAC does not require documentary\nevidence of citizenship; rather, it requires only that an\napplicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a\ncitizen. Arizona law requires voter-registration officials to\n\u201creject\u201d any application for registration, including a Fed-\neral Form, that is not accompanied by concrete evidence of\ncitizenship. The question is whether Arizona\u2019s evidence-\nof-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form\napplicants, is pre-empted by the Act\u2019s mandate that States\n\u201caccept and use\u201d the Federal Form.\n                            I\n   Over the past two decades, Congress has erected a\ncomplex superstructure of federal regulation atop state\nvoter-registration systems. The National Voter Registra-\ntion Act of 1993 (NVRA), 107 Stat. 77, as amended, 42\n2      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq., \u201crequires States to provide simpli-\nfied systems for registering to vote in federal elections.\u201d\nYoung v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 275 (1997). The Act\nrequires each State to permit prospective voters to \u201cregis-\nter to vote in elections for Federal office\u201d by any of three\nmethods: simultaneously with a driver\u2019s license applica-\ntion, in person, or by mail. \u00a71973gg\u20132(a).\n   This case concerns registration by mail.           Section\n1973gg\u20132(a)(2) of the Act requires a State to establish\nprocedures for registering to vote in federal elections \u201cby\nmail application pursuant to section 1973gg\u20134 of this\ntitle.\u201d Section 1973gg\u20134, in turn, requires States to \u201cac-\ncept and use\u201d a standard federal registration form.\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). The Election Assistance Commission is\ninvested with rulemaking authority to prescribe the con-\ntents of that Federal Form. \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(1); see \u00a715329.1\nThe EAC is explicitly instructed, however, to develop the\nFederal Form \u201cin consultation with the chief election\nofficers of the States.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2). The Federal Form\nthus contains a number of state-specific instructions,\nwhich tell residents of each State what additional infor-\nmation they must provide and where they must submit\nthe form. See National Mail Voter Registration Form, pp.\n3\u201320, online at http://www.eac.gov (all Internet materials\nas visited June 11, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file); 11 CFR \u00a79428.3 (2012). Each state-specific\ninstruction must be approved by the EAC before it is\nincluded on the Federal Form.\n   To be eligible to vote under Arizona law, a person must\nbe a citizen of the United States. Ariz. Const., Art. VII, \u00a72;\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013101(A) (West 2006). This case\nconcerns Arizona\u2019s efforts to enforce that qualification. In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Help America Vote Act of 2002 transferred this function from\n\nthe Federal Election Commission to the EAC. See \u00a7802, 116 Stat. 1726,\ncodified at 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a715532, 1973gg\u20137(a).\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 2\n(2006) (per curiam).2 Proposition 200 amended the State\u2019s\nelection code to require county recorders to \u201creject any\napplication for registration that is not accompanied by\nsatisfactory evidence of United States citizenship.\u201d Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F) (West Supp. 2012). The proof-\nof-citizenship requirement is satisfied by (1) a photocopy of\nthe applicant\u2019s passport or birth certificate, (2) a driver\u2019s\nlicense number, if the license states that the issuing au-\nthority verified the holder\u2019s U. S. citizenship, (3) evidence\nof naturalization, (4) tribal identification, or (5) \u201c[o]ther\ndocuments or methods of proof . . . established pursuant to\nthe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\u201d Ibid.\nThe EAC did not grant Arizona\u2019s request to include this\nnew requirement among the state-specific instructions\nfor Arizona on the Federal Form. App. 225. Conse-\nquently, the Federal Form includes a statutorily required\nattestation, subscribed to under penalty of perjury, that\nan Arizona applicant meets the State\u2019s voting require-\nments (including the citizenship requirement), see\n\u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(2), but does not require concrete evidence of\ncitizenship.\n   The two groups of plaintiffs represented here\u2014a group\nof individual Arizona residents (dubbed the Gonzalez\nplaintiffs, after lead plaintiff Jesus Gonzalez) and a group\nof nonprofit organizations led by the Inter Tribal Council\nof Arizona (ITCA)\u2014filed separate suits seeking to enjoin\nthe voting provisions of Proposition 200. The District\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 In May 2005, the United States Attorney General precleared under\n\n\u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the procedures Arizona adopted to\nimplement Proposition 200. Purcell, 549 U. S., at 3.\n4       ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nCourt consolidated the cases and denied the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotions for a preliminary injunction. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 1g. A two-judge motions panel of the Court of Ap-\npeals for the Ninth Circuit then enjoined Proposition 200\npending appeal. Purcell, 549 U. S., at 3. We vacated that\norder and allowed the impending 2006 election to proceed\nwith the new rules in place. Id., at 5\u20136. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court\u2019s initial\ndenial of a preliminary injunction as to respondents\u2019 claim\nthat the NVRA pre-empts Proposition 200\u2019s registration\nrules. Gonzales v. Arizona, 485 F. 3d 1041, 1050\u20131051\n(2007). The District Court then granted Arizona\u2019s motion\nfor summary judgment as to that claim. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 1e, 3e. A panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part\nbut reversed as relevant here, holding that \u201cProposition\n200\u2019s documentary proof of citizenship requirement con-\nflicts with the NVRA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose.\u201d\nGonzales v. Arizona, 624 F. 3d 1162, 1181 (2010). The en\nbanc Court of Appeals agreed. Gonzalez v. Arizona, 677\nF. 3d 383, 403 (2012). We granted certiorari. 568 U.

I, \u00a74, cl. 1, provides:\n      \u201cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections\n      for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed\n      in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the\n      Congress may at any time by Law make or alter\n      such Regulations, except as to the places of chusing\n      Senators.\u201d\nThe Clause empowers Congress to pre-empt state regula-\ntions governing the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of holding\ncongressional elections. The question here is whether the\nfederal statutory requirement that States \u201caccept and use\u201d\nthe Federal Form pre-empts Arizona\u2019s state-law require-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Upon the\nStates it imposes the duty (\u201cshall be prescribed\u201d) to pre-\nscribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representa-\ntives and Senators; upon Congress it confers the power to\nalter those regulations or supplant them altogether. See\nU. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 804\u2013\n805 (1995); id., at 862 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). This\ngrant of congressional power was the Framers\u2019 insurance\nagainst the possibility that a State would refuse to provide\nfor the election of representatives to the Federal Congress.\n\u201c[E]very government ought to contain in itself the means\nof its own preservation,\u201d and \u201can exclusive power of regu-\nlating elections for the national government, in the hands\nof the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the\nUnion entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment\nannihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of\npersons to administer its affairs.\u201d The Federalist No. 59,\npp. 362\u2013363 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (empha-\nsis deleted). That prospect seems fanciful today, but the\nwidespread, vociferous opposition to the proposed Consti-\ntution made it a very real concern in the founding era.\n   The Clause\u2019s substantive scope is broad. \u201cTimes, Places,\nand Manner,\u201d we have written, are \u201ccomprehensive\nwords,\u201d which \u201cembrace authority to provide a complete\ncode for congressional elections,\u201d including, as relevant\nhere and as petitioners do not contest, regulations relat-\ning to \u201cregistration.\u201d Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 366\n(1932); see also Roudebush v. Hartke, 405 U. S. 15, 24\u201325\n(1972) (recounts); United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299,\n320 (1941) (primaries). In practice, the Clause functions\nas \u201ca default provision; it invests the States with responsi-\n6     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbility for the mechanics of congressional elections, but only\nso far as Congress declines to pre-empt state legislative\nchoices.\u201d Foster v. Love, 522 U. S. 67, 69 (1997) (citation\nomitted). The power of Congress over the \u201cTimes, Places\nand Manner\u201d of congressional elections \u201cis paramount, and\nmay be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it\ndeems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no\nfarther, the regulations effected supersede those of the\nState which are inconsistent therewith.\u201d Ex parte Siebold,\n100 U. S. 371, 392 (1880).\n                              B\n  The straightforward textual question here is whether\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F), which requires state\nofficials to \u201creject\u201d a Federal Form unaccompanied by\ndocumentary evidence of citizenship, conflicts with the\nNVRA\u2019s mandate that Arizona \u201caccept and use\u201d the Fed-\neral Form. If so, the state law, \u201cso far as the conflict ex-\ntends, ceases to be operative.\u201d Siebold, supra, at 384. In\nArizona\u2019s view, these seemingly incompatible obligations\ncan be read to operate harmoniously: The NVRA, it con-\ntends, requires merely that a State receive the Federal\nForm willingly and use that form as one element in its\n(perhaps lengthy) transaction with a prospective voter.\n  Taken in isolation, the mandate that a State \u201caccept and\nuse\u201d the Federal Form is fairly susceptible of two inter-\npretations. It might mean that a State must accept the\nFederal Form as a complete and sufficient registration ap-\nplication; or it might mean that the State is merely required\nto receive the form willingly and use it somehow in its\nvoter registration process. Both readings\u2014\u201creceive will-\ningly\u201d and \u201caccept as sufficient\u201d\u2014are compatible with the\nplain meaning of the word \u201caccept.\u201d See 1 Oxford English\nDictionary 70 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cTo take or receive (a thing\noffered) willingly\u201d; \u201cTo receive as sufficient or adequate\u201d);\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 14 (2d ed. 1954)\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

See\nalso Brief for State Petitioners 40 (\u201cAn airline may adver-\ntise that it \u2018accepts and uses\u2019 e-tickets . . . , yet may still\nrequire photo identification before one could board the\nairplane\u201d).\n   \u201cWords that can have more than one meaning are given\ncontent, however, by their surroundings.\u201d Whitman v.\nAmerican Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 466 (2001);\nsee also Smith, supra, at 241 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). And\nreading \u201caccept\u201d merely to denote willing receipt seems\nout of place in the context of an official mandate to accept\nand use something for a given purpose. The implication of\nsuch a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as suffi-\ncient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy. For exam-\nple, a government diktat that \u201ccivil servants shall accept\ngovernment IOUs for payment of salaries\u201d does not invite\nthe response, \u201csure, we\u2019ll accept IOUs\u2014if you pay us a ten\npercent down payment in cash.\u201d Many federal statutes\ncontain similarly phrased commands, and they contem-\nplate more than mere willing receipt. See, e.g., 5 U. S. C.\n\u00a78332(b), (m)(3) (\u201cThe Office [of Personnel Management]\nshall accept the certification of \u201d various officials concern-\ning creditable service toward civilian-employee retire-\nment); 12 U.

(Emphasis added.) Yet Arizona reads the\nphrase \u201caccept and use\u201d in \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) as permitting\nit to reject a completed Federal Form if the applicant does\nnot submit additional information required by state law.\nThat reading can be squared with Arizona\u2019s obligation\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Thedissent accepts that a State may not impose additional re-\nquirements that render the Federal Form entirely superfluous; it would\nrequire that the State \u201cus[e] the form as a meaningful part of the\nregistration process.\u201d Post, at 7 (opinion of ALITO, J.). The dissent does\nnot tell us precisely how large a role for the Federal Form suffices to\nmake it \u201cmeaningful\u201d: One step out of two? Three? Ten? There is no\neasy answer, for the dissent\u2019s \u201cmeaningful part\u201d standard is as inde-\nterminate as it is atextual.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

It is\nimprobable that the statute envisions a completed copy of\nthe form it takes such pains to create as being anything\nless than \u201cvalid.\u201d\n   The Act also authorizes States, \u201c[i]n addition to accept-\ning and using the\u201d Federal Form, to create their own,\nstate-specific voter-registration forms, which can be used\nto register voters in both state and federal elections.\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2) (emphasis added). These state-developed\nforms may require information the Federal Form does not.\n(For example, unlike the Federal Form, Arizona\u2019s registra-\ntion form includes Proposition 200\u2019s proof-of-citizenship\nrequirement. See Arizona Voter Registration Form, p. 1,\nonline at http://www.azsos.gov.) This permission works in\ntandem with the requirement that States \u201caccept and use\u201d\nthe Federal Form. States retain the flexibility to design\nand use their own registration forms, but the Federal\nForm provides a backstop: No matter what procedural\nhurdles a State\u2019s own form imposes, the Federal Form\nguarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in\nfederal elections will be available.4 Arizona\u2019s reading\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In the face of this straightforward explanation, the dissent main-\ntains that it would be \u201cnonsensical\u201d for a less demanding federal form\nto exist alongside a more demanding state form. Post, at 9 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). But it is the dissent\u2019s alternative explanation for \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(2) that makes no sense. The \u201cpurpose\u201d of the Federal Form, it\nclaims, is \u201cto facilitate interstate voter registration drives. Thanks to\nthe federal form, volunteers distributing voter registration materials at\na shopping mall in Yuma can give a copy of the same form to every\nperson they meet without attempting to distinguish between residents\nof Arizona and California.\u201d Post, at 9. But in the dissent\u2019s world, a\nvolunteer in Yuma would have to give every prospective voter not only\n10      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwould permit a State to demand of Federal Form appli-\ncants every additional piece of information the State\nrequires on its state-specific form. If that is so, the Fed-\neral Form ceases to perform any meaningful function, and\nwould be a feeble means of \u201cincreas[ing] the number of\neligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal\noffice.\u201d \u00a71973gg(b).\n   Finally, Arizona appeals to the presumption against\npre-emption sometimes invoked in our Supremacy Clause\ncases. See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460\u2013\n461 (1991). Where it applies, \u201cwe start with the assump-\ntion that the historic police powers of the States were not\nto be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the\nclear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Rice v. Santa Fe\nElevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). That rule of\nconstruction rests on an assumption about congressional\nintent: that \u201cCongress does not exercise lightly\u201d the \u201cex-\ntraordinary power\u201d to \u201clegislate in areas traditionally\nregulated by the States.\u201d Gregory, supra, at 460. We have\nnever mentioned such a principle in our Elections Clause\ncases.5 Siebold, for example, simply said that Elections\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na Federal Form, but also a separate set of either Arizona- or California-\nspecific instructions detailing the additional information the applicant\nmust submit to the State. In ours, every eligible voter can be assured\nthat if he does what the Federal Form says, he will be registered. The\ndissent therefore provides yet another compelling reason to interpret\nthe statute our way.\n  5 United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), on which the dis-\n\nsent relies, see post, at 3\u20134 (opinion of ALITO, J.), is not to the contrary\u2014\nindeed, it was not even a pre-emption case. In Gradwell, we held that\na statute making it a federal crime \u201cto defraud the United States\u201d\ndid not reach election fraud. 243 U. S., at 480, 483. The Court noted\nthat the provision at issue was adopted in a tax-enforcement bill, and\nthat Congress had enacted but then repealed other criminal statutes\nspecifically covering election fraud. Id., at 481\u2013483.\n  The dissent cherry-picks some language from a sentence in Gradwell,\nsee post, at 3\u20134, but the full sentence reveals its irrelevance to our case:\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nClause legislation, \u201cso far as it extends and conflicts with\nthe regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them.\u201d\n100 U. S., at 384. There is good reason for treating Elec-\ntions Clause legislation differently: The assumption that\nCongress is reluctant to pre-empt does not hold when\nCongress acts under that constitutional provision, which\nempowers Congress to \u201cmake or alter\u201d state election regu-\nlations. Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1. When Congress legislates with\nrespect to the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of holding\ncongressional elections, it necessarily displaces some\nelement of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the\nStates.6 Because the power the Elections Clause confers is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n     \u201cWith it thus clearly established that the policy of Congress for so\n     great a part of our constitutional life has been, and now is, to\n     leave the conduct of the election of its members to state laws, ad-\n     ministered by state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to\n     regulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear stat-\n     utes, such as were enacted in 1870, it would be a strained and\n     unreasonable construction to apply to such elections this \u00a737, orig-\n     inally a law for the protection of the revenue and for now fifty\n     years confined in its application to \u2018Offenses against the Opera-\n     tions of the Government\u2019 as distinguished from the processes by\n     which men are selected to conduct such operations.\u201d 243 U. S., at\n     485.\nGradwell says nothing at all about pre-emption, or about how to con-\nstrue statutes (like the NVRA) in which Congress has indisputably\nundertaken \u201cto regulate such elections.\u201d Ibid.\n  6 The dissent counters that this is so \u201cwhenever Congress legislates in\n\nan area of concurrent state and federal power.\u201d Post, at 5 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). True, but irrelevant: Elections Clause legislation is unique\nprecisely because it always falls within an area of concurrent state and\nfederal power. Put differently, all action under the Elections Clause\ndisplaces some element of a pre-existing state regulatory regime,\nbecause the text of the Clause confers the power to do exactly (and only)\nthat. By contrast, even laws enacted under the Commerce Clause\n(arguably the other enumerated power whose exercise is most likely to\ntrench on state regulatory authority) will not always implicate concur-\nrent state power\u2014a prohibition on the interstate transport of a com-\nmodity, for example.\n12        ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nnone other than the power to pre-empt, the reasonable\nassumption is that the statutory text accurately communi-\ncates the scope of Congress\u2019s pre-emptive intent. More-\nover, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption\nin the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker\nhere. Unlike the States\u2019 \u201chistoric police powers,\u201d Rice,\nsupra, at 230, the States\u2019 role in regulating congressional\nelections\u2014while weighty and worthy of respect\u2014has\nalways existed subject to the express qualification that it\n\u201cterminates according to federal law.\u201d Buckman Co. v.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347 (2001). In\nsum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections\nClause legislation simply to mean what it says.\n  We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is\nthat a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizen-\nship not required by the Federal Form is \u201cinconsistent\nwith\u201d the NVRA\u2019s mandate that States \u201caccept and use\u201d\nthe Federal Form. Siebold, supra, at 397. If this reading\nprevails, the Elections Clause requires that Arizona\u2019s rule\ngive way.\n  We note, however, that while the NVRA forbids States\nto demand that an applicant submit additional infor-\nmation beyond that required by the Federal Form, it does\nnot preclude States from \u201cdeny[ing] registration based on\ninformation in their possession establishing the appli-\ncant\u2019s ineligibility.\u201d7 Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24. The NVRA clearly contemplates that not every\nsubmitted Federal Form will result in registration. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  dissent seems to think this position of ours incompatible with\nour reading of \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), which requires a State to \u201censure\nthat any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election . . . if the\nvalid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked\u201d by a\ncertain date. See post, at 9\u201310 (opinion of ALITO, J.). What the dissent\noverlooks is that \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) only requires a State to register an\n\u201celigible applicant\u201d who submits a timely Federal Form.

The Constitution prescribes a\nstraightforward rule for the composition of the federal\nelectorate. Article I, \u00a72, cl. 1, provides that electors in\neach State for the House of Representatives \u201cshall have\nthe Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most nu-\nmerous Branch of the State Legislature,\u201d and the Seven-\nteenth Amendment adopts the same criterion for senatorial\nelections. Cf. also Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 2 (\u201cEach State shall\nappoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may\ndirect,\u201d presidential electors). One cannot read the Elec-\ntions Clause as treating implicitly what these other consti-\ntutional provisions regulate explicitly. \u201cIt is difficult to see\nhow words could be clearer in stating what Congress can\ncontrol and what it cannot control. Surely nothing in\nthese provisions lends itself to the view that voting quali-\nfications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.\u201d\nOregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.

INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nvens, J., dissenting).8\n  Prescribing voting qualifications, therefore, \u201cforms no\npart of the power to be conferred upon the national gov-\nernment\u201d by the Elections Clause, which is \u201cexpressly\nrestricted to the regulation of the times, the places, and\nthe manner of elections.\u201d The Federalist No. 60, at 371\n(A.

Farrand rev. 1966). At the same time, by tying the\nfederal franchise to the state franchise instead of simply\nplacing it within the unfettered discretion of state legisla-\ntures, the Framers avoided \u201crender[ing] too dependent on\nthe State governments that branch of the federal govern-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 In Mitchell, the judgment of the Court was that Congress could\n\ncompel the States to permit 18-year-olds to vote in federal elections. Of\nthe five Justices who concurred in that outcome, only Justice Black was\nof the view that congressional power to prescribe this age qualification\nderived from the Elections Clause, 400 U. S., at 119\u2013125, while four\nJustices relied on the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 144 (opinion of\nDouglas, J.), 231 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.).\nThat result, which lacked a majority rationale, is of minimal preceden-\ntial value here. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66\n(1996); Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994); H. Black,\nHandbook on the Law of Judicial Precedents 135\u2013136 (1912). Five\nJustices took the position that the Elections Clause did not confer upon\nCongress the power to regulate voter qualifications in federal elections.\nMitchell, supra, at 143 (opinion of Douglas, J.), 210 (opinion of Harlan,\nJ.), 288 (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C.

See also U. S. Term Limits, 514\nU. S., at 833. Five Justices also agreed that the Fourteenth Amend-\nment did not empower Congress to impose the 18-year-old-voting\nmandate.

Madison).\n   Since the power to establish voting requirements is of\nlittle value without the power to enforce those require-\nments, Arizona is correct that it would raise serious con-\nstitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State\nfrom obtaining the information necessary to enforce its\nvoter qualifications.9 If, but for Arizona\u2019s interpretation of\nthe \u201caccept and use\u201d provision, the State would be pre-\ncluded from obtaining information necessary for enforce-\nment, we would have to determine whether Arizona\u2019s\ninterpretation, though plainly not the best reading, is at\nleast a possible one. Cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22,\n62 (1932) (the Court will \u201cascertain whether a construction\nof the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional]\nquestion may be avoided\u201d (emphasis added)). Happily,\nwe are spared that necessity, since the statute provides\nanother means by which Arizona may obtain information\nneeded for enforcement.\n   Section 1973gg\u20137(b)(1) of the Act provides that the\nFederal Form \u201cmay require only such identifying infor-\nmation (including the signature of the applicant) and\nother information (including data relating to previous\nregistration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable\nthe appropriate State election official to assess the eligibil-\nity of the applicant and to administer voter registration\nand other parts of the election process.\u201d At oral argument,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 In their reply brief, petitioners suggest for the first time that \u201cregis-\n\ntration is itself a qualification to vote.\u201d Reply Brief for State Petition-\ners 24 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 1, 16 (opinion of THOMAS, J.);\ncf. Voting Rights Coalition v. Wilson, 60 F. 3d 1411, 1413, and n. 1 (CA9\n1995), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1093 (1996); Association of Community\nOrganizations for Reform Now (ACORN) v. Edgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 793\n(CA7 1995). We resolve this case on the theory on which it has hitherto\nbeen litigated: that citizenship (not registration) is the voter qualifica-\ntion Arizona seeks to enforce. See Brief for State Petitioners 50.\n16    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States expressed the view that the phrase\n\u201cmay require only\u201d in \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1) means that the\nEAC \u201cshall require information that\u2019s necessary, but may\nonly require that information.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (em-\nphasis added); see also Brief for ITCA Respondents 46; Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37\u201339 (ITCA Respondents\u2019 counsel). That is\nto say, \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1) acts as both a ceiling and a floor\nwith respect to the contents of the Federal Form. We need\nnot consider the Government\u2019s contention that despite the\nstatute\u2019s statement that the EAC \u201cmay\u201d require on the\nFederal Form information \u201cnecessary to enable the appro-\npriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the\napplicant,\u201d other provisions of the Act indicate that such\naction is statutorily required. That is because we think\nthat\u2014by analogy to the rule of statutory interpretation\nthat avoids questionable constitutionality\u2014validly con-\nferred discretionary executive authority is properly exer-\ncised (as the Government has proposed) to avoid serious\nconstitutional doubt. That is to say, it is surely permissi-\nble if not requisite for the Government to say that neces-\nsary information which may be required will be required.\n   Since, pursuant to the Government\u2019s concession, a State\nmay request that the EAC alter the Federal Form to in-\nclude information the State deems necessary to determine\neligibility, see \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 55 (United\nStates), and may challenge the EAC\u2019s rejection of that\nrequest in a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act,\nsee 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701\u2013706, no constitutional doubt is raised\nby giving the \u201caccept and use\u201d provision of the NVRA its\nfairest reading. That alternative means of enforcing its\nconstitutional power to determine voting qualifications\nremains open to Arizona here. In 2005, the EAC divided\n2-to-2 on the request by Arizona to include the evidence-of-\ncitizenship requirement among the state-specific instruc-\ntions on the Federal Form, App. 225, which meant that no\naction could be taken, see 42 U.

Arizona did not challenge\nthat agency action (or rather inaction) by seeking APA\nreview in federal court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\u201312 (Ari-\nzona), but we are aware of nothing that prevents Arizona\nfrom renewing its request.10 Should the EAC\u2019s inaction\npersist, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in\na reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to\neffectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is\ntherefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Ari-\nzona\u2019s concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form.\nSee 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(1). Arizona might also assert (as it has\nargued here) that it would be arbitrary for the EAC to\nrefuse to include Arizona\u2019s instruction when it has accepted\na similar instruction requested by Louisiana.11\n                     *     *    *\n  We hold that 42 U.

See App. 181.\n   The EAC currently lacks a quorum\u2014indeed, the Commission has not\na single active Commissioner. If the EAC proves unable to act on a\nrenewed request, Arizona would be free to seek a writ of mandamus to\n\u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5\nU. S.

It is a nice point, which we need not resolve here,\nwhether a court can compel agency action that the agency itself, for\nlack of the statutorily required quorum, is incapable of taking. If the\nanswer to that is no, Arizona might then be in a position to assert a\nconstitutional right to demand concrete evidence of citizenship apart\nfrom the Federal Form.\n   11 The EAC recently approved a state-specific instruction for Louisi-\n\nana requiring applicants who lack a Louisiana driver\u2019s license, ID card,\nor Social Security number to attach additional documentation to the\ncompleted Federal Form.

Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 654 (1995), does\nnot apply here because the source of congressional power\nis the Elections Clause and not some other provision of the\nConstitution. See ante, at 10\u201312.\n   There is no sound basis for the Court to rule, for the\nfirst time, that there exists a hierarchy of federal powers\nso that some statutes pre-empting state law must be in-\nterpreted by different rules than others, all depending\nupon which power Congress has exercised. If the Court is\nskeptical of the basic idea of a presumption against pre-\nemption as a helpful instrument of construction in express\npre-emption cases, see Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.,\n505 U. S. 504, 545 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg-\nment in part and dissenting in part), it should say so and\napply that skepticism across the board.\n   There are numerous instances in which Congress, in the\nundoubted exercise of its enumerated powers, has stated\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nits express purpose and intent to pre-empt state law. But\nthe Court has nonetheless recognized that \u201cwhen the text\nof a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one\nplausible reading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that\ndisfavors pre-emption.\u2019 \u201d Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555\nU. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences\nLLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005)). This principle is best\nunderstood, perhaps, not as a presumption but as a cau-\ntionary principle to ensure that pre-emption does not go\nbeyond the strict requirements of the statutory command.\nThe principle has two dimensions: Courts must be careful\nnot to give an unduly broad interpretation to ambiguous\nor imprecise language Congress uses. And they must\nconfine their opinions to avoid overextending a federal\nstatute\u2019s pre-emptive reach. Error on either front may put\nat risk the validity and effectiveness of laws that Con-\ngress did not intend to disturb and that a State has\ndeemed important to its scheme of governance. That con-\ncern is the same regardless of the power Congress invokes,\nwhether it is, say, the commerce power, the war power,\nthe bankruptcy power, or the power to regulate federal\nelections under Article I, \u00a74.\n   Whether the federal statute concerns congressional\nregulation of elections or any other subject proper for\nCongress to address, a court must not lightly infer a con-\ngressional directive to negate the States\u2019 otherwise proper\nexercise of their sovereign power. This case illustrates the\npoint. The separate States have a continuing, essential\ninterest in the integrity and accuracy of the process used\nto select both state and federal officials. The States pay\nthe costs of holding these elections, which for practical\nreasons often overlap so that the two sets of officials are\nselected at the same time, on the same ballots, by the\nsame voters. It seems most doubtful to me to suggest that\nStates have some lesser concern when what is involved\nis their own historic role in the conduct of elections. As\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

For this rea-\nson, I concur in the judgment and join all of the Court\u2019s\nopinion except its discussion of the presumption against\npre-emption.

S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1), the federal\nvoter registration form created pursuant to the National\nVoter Registration Act (NVRA). The Court interprets\n\u201caccept and use,\u201d with minor exceptions, to require States\nto register any individual who completes and submits the\nfederal form. It, therefore, holds that \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) pre-\nempts an Arizona law requiring additional information\nto register. As the majority recognizes, ante, at 13\u201315,\nits decision implicates a serious constitutional issue\u2014\nwhether Congress has power to set qualifications for those\nwho vote in elections for federal office.\n   I do not agree, and I think that both the plain text\nand the history of the Voter Qualifications Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment\nauthorize States to determine the qualifications of voters\nin federal elections, which necessarily includes the related\npower to determine whether those qualifications are satis-\nfied. To avoid substantial constitutional problems created\nby interpreting \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) to permit Congress to ef-\nfectively countermand this authority, I would construe\nthe law as only requiring Arizona to accept and use the\nform as part of its voter registration process, leaving the\nState free to request whatever additional information it\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndetermines is necessary to ensure that voters meet the\nqualifications it has the constitutional authority to estab-\nlish.   Under this interpretation, Arizona did \u201caccept\nand use\u201d the federal form. Accordingly, there is no con-\nflict between Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F) (West\nCum. Supp. 2012) and \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) and, thus, no\npre-emption.\n                               I\n   In 2002, Congress created the Election Assistance\nCommission (EAC), 42 U. S. C. \u00a715321 et seq., and gave\nit the ongoing responsibility of \u201cdevelop[ing] a mail voter\nregistration application form for elections for Federal\noffice\u201d \u201cin consultation with the chief election officers of\nthe States.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2). Under the NVRA, \u201c[e]ach\nState shall accept and use the mail voter registration\napplication form\u201d the EAC develops. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). The\nNVRA also states in a subsequent provision that \u201c[i]n\naddition to accepting and using the form described in\nparagraph (1), a State may develop and use a mail voter\nregistration form . . . for the registration of voters in elec-\ntions for Federal office\u201d so long as it satisfies the same\ncriteria as the federal form. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2).\n   Section 1973gg\u20137(b) enumerates the criteria for the fed-\neral form. The form \u201cmay require only such identifying in-\nformation . . . and other information . . . as is necessary\nto enable the appropriate State election official to assess\nthe eligibility of the applicant.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1).

Const., Art. VII,\n\u00a72. In 2004, Arizona citizens enacted Proposition 200, the\nlaw at issue in this case. Proposition 200 provides that\n\u201c[t]he county recorder shall reject any application for\nregistration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evi-\ndence of United States citizenship.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a716\u2013166(F). The law sets forth several examples of satis-\nfactory evidence, including driver\u2019s license number, birth\ncertificate, U. S. passport, naturalization documents, and\nvarious tribal identification documents for Indians. \u00a716\u2013\n166(F)(1)\u2013(6).\n   Respondents, joined by the United States, allege that these\nstate requirements are pre-empted by the NVRA\u2019s man-\ndate that all States \u201caccept and use\u201d the federal form\npromulgated by the EAC. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). They contend\nthat the phrase \u201caccept and use\u201d requires a State pre-\nsented with a completed federal form to register the individ-\nual to vote without requiring any additional information.\n   Arizona advances an alternative interpretation. It ar-\ngues that \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) is satisfied so long as the State\n\u201caccepts and use[s]\u201d the federal form as part of its voter\nqualification process. For example, a State \u201caccepts and\nuse[s]\u201d the federal form by allowing individuals to file it,\neven if the State requires additional identifying infor-\nmation to establish citizenship. In Arizona\u2019s view, it \u201cac-\ncepts and uses\u201d the federal form in the same way that\nan airline \u201caccepts and uses\u201d electronic tickets but also\nrequires an individual seeking to board a plane to demon-\nstrate that he is the person named on the ticket.

See 677 F. 3d, at 439 (Kozinski, C.J.,\nconcurring) (weighing the arguments). The competing\ninterpretations of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) raise significant consti-\ntutional issues concerning Congress\u2019 power to decide who\nmay vote in federal elections. Accordingly, resolution of\nthis case requires a better understanding of the relevant\nconstitutional provisions.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   The Voter Qualifications Clause, U.

The Seventeenth\nAmendment, which provides for direct election of Senators,\ncontains an identical clause. That language is suscep-\ntible of only one interpretation: States have the author-\nity \u201cto control who may vote in congressional elections\u201d so\nlong as they do not \u201cestablish special requirements that do\nnot apply in elections for the state legislature.\u201d U.

The Framers did not intend\nto leave voter qualifications to Congress. Indeed, James\nMadison explicitly rejected that possibility:\n    \u201cThe definition of the right of suffrage is very justly\n    regarded as a fundamental article of republican govern-\n    ment. It was incumbent on the convention, therefore,\n    to define and establish this right in the Constitu-\n    tion. To have left it open for the occasional regulation\n    of the Congress would have been improper.\u201d The Fed-\n    eralist No. 52, at 323 (emphasis added).\nCongressional legislation of voter qualifications was not\npart of the Framers\u2019 design.\n   The Constitutional Convention did recognize a danger in\nleaving Congress \u201ctoo dependent on the State govern-\nments\u201d by allowing States to define congressional elector\nqualifications without limitation. Ibid. To address this\nconcern, the Committee of Detail that drafted Article I, \u00a72,\n\u201cweighed the possibility of a federal property requirement,\nas well as several proposals that would have given the\nfederal government the power to impose its own suffrage\nlaws at some future time.\u201d A. Keyssar, The Right to Vote\n18 (rev. ed. 2009) (hereafter Keyssar); see also 2 The Rec-\nords of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 139\u2013140, 151,\n153, 163\u2013165 (M. Farrand rev. ed. 1966) (text of several\nvoter qualification provisions considered by the Committee\nof Detail).\n   These efforts, however, were ultimately abandoned. Even\nif the convention had been able to agree on a uniform\nfederal standard, the Framers knew that state ratification\nconventions likely would have rejected it. Madison ex-\n6     ARIZONA v.

Story, Commentaries on the Consti-\ntution of the United States 217 (abridged ed. 1833) (same).\nJustice Story elaborated that setting voter qualifications\nin the Constitution could have jeopardized ratification,\nbecause it would have been difficult to convince States to\ngive up their right to set voting qualifications.

See also Keyssar 306\u2013313 (Tables A.1 and A.2)\n(state-by-state analysis of 18th- and 19th-century voter qual-\nifications, including property, taxpaying, residency, sex,\nand race requirements).\n   The Convention, thus, chose to respect the varied state\nvoting rules and instead struck the balance enshrined in\nArticle I, \u00a72\u2019s requirement that federal electors \u201cshall have\nthe Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numer-\nous Branch of the State Legislature.\u201d That compromise\ngave States free reign over federal voter qualifications\nbut protected Congress by prohibiting States from chang-\ning the qualifications for federal electors unless they also\naltered qualifications for their own legislatures. See The\nFederalist No. 52, at 323. This balance left the States\nwith nearly complete control over voter qualifications.\n                               2\n  Respondents appear to concede that States have the sole\nauthority to establish voter qualifications, see, e.g., Brief\nfor Gonzalez Respondents 63, but nevertheless argue that\nCongress can determine whether those qualifications are\nsatisfied. See, e.g., id., at 61. The practical effect of re-\nspondents\u2019 position is to read Article I, \u00a72, out of the Con-\nstitution.

S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFor this reason, the Voter Qualifications Clause gives\nStates the authority not only to set qualifications but\nalso the power to verify whether those qualifications are\nsatisfied.\n   This understanding of Article I, \u00a72, is consistent with\npowers enjoyed by the States at the founding. For in-\nstance, ownership of real or personal property was a com-\nmon prerequisite to voting, see Keyssar 306\u2013313 (Tables\nA.1 and A.2). To verify that this qualification was satis-\nfied, States might look to proof of tax payments. See C.\nWilliamson, American Suffrage from Property to Democ-\nracy, 1760\u20131860, p. 32 (1960). In other instances, States\nrelied on personal knowledge of fellow citizens to verify\nvoter eligibility. Keyssar 24 (\u201cIn some locales, particularly\nin the South, voting was still an oral and public act: men\nassembled before election judges, waited for their names\nto be called, and then announced which candidates they\nsupported\u201d). States have always had the power to ensure\nthat only those qualified under state law to cast ballots\nexercised the franchise.\n   Perhaps in part because many requirements (such as\nproperty ownership or taxpayer status) were indepen-\ndently documented and verifiable, States in 1789 did not\ngenerally \u201cregister\u201d voters using highly formalized proce-\ndures. See id., at 122. Over time, States replaced their\ninformal systems for determining eligibility, with more\nformalized pre-voting registration regimes. See An Act in\nAddition to the Several Acts for Regulating Elections,\n1800 Mass. Acts ch. 74, in Acts and Laws of the Common-\nwealth of Massachusetts 96 (1897) (Massachusetts\u2019 1801\nvoter registration law). But modern voter registration\nserves the same basic purpose as the practices used by\nStates in the Colonies and early Federal Republic. The\nfact that States have liberalized voting qualifications and\nstreamlined the verification process through registration\ndoes not alter the basic fact that States possess broad\n8           ARIZONA v.

Id., at 20.\nThe Constitution does not use the word \u201cManner\u201d in iso-\nlation; rather, \u201cafter providing for qualifications, times,\nand places, the Constitution described the residuum as \u2018the\nManner of holding Elections.\u2019 This precise phrase seems\nto have been newly coined to denote a subset of traditional\n\u2018manner\u2019 regulation.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis deleted; footnote\nomitted). Consistent with this view, during the state\nratification debates, the \u201cManner of holding Elections\u201d was\nconstrued to mean the circumstances under which elec-\ntions were held and the mechanics of the actual election.\nSee 4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the\nAdoption of the Federal Constitution 71 (J.

Unlike\nArticle I, \u00a72, the Times, Places and Manner Clause was\nthe subject of extensive ratification controversy. Antifed-\neralists were deeply concerned with ceding authority over\nthe conduct of elections to the Federal Government. Some\nantifederalists claimed that the \u201c \u2018wealthy and the well-\nborn,\u2019 \u201d might abuse the Times, Places and Manner Clause\nto ensure their continuing power in Congress. The Feder-\nalist No. 60, at 368.

The North Carolina debates provide a particu-\nlarly direct example. There, delegate John Steele relied\non the established \u201cmaxim of universal jurisprudence, of\nreason and common sense, that an instrument or deed of\nwriting shall be construed as to give validity to all parts\nof it, if it can be done without involving any absurdity\u201d in\nsupport of the argument that Article I, \u00a72\u2019s grant of voter\nqualifications to the States required a limited reading of\nArticle I, \u00a74. 4 Elliot\u2019s Debates 71.\n   This was no isolated view. See 2 id., at 50\u201351 (Massa-\nchusetts delegate Rufus King observing that \u201cthe power of\ncontrol given by [Article I, \u00a74,] extends to the manner of\nelection, not the qualifications of the electors\u201d); 4 id., at 61\n(same, North Carolina\u2019s William Davie); 3 id., at 202\u2013203\n(same, Virginia delegate Edmund Randolph); Roger Sher-\nman, A Citizen of New Haven: Observations on the New\nFederal Constitution, Connecticut Courant, Jan. 7, 1788,\nin 15 Documentary History 282 (J.

The Times, Places and Manner\nClause was designed to address the possibility that States\nmight refuse to hold any federal elections at all, eliminat-\ning Congress, and by extension the Federal Government.\nAs Hamilton explained, \u201cevery government ought to con-\ntain in itself the means of its own preservation.\u201d The\n12    ARIZONA v.

Reflecting this understanding\nof the reasoning behind Article I, \u00a74, many of the original\n13 States proposed constitutional amendments that would\nhave strictly cabined the Times, Places and Manner Clause\nto situations in which state failure to hold elections\nthreatened the continued existence of Congress.

Al-\nthough these amendments were never enacted, they un-\nderscore how narrowly the ratification conventions con-\nstrued Congress\u2019 power under the Times, Places and Man-\nner Clause.

But this\nCourt does not have the power to alter the terms of\nthe Constitution. Moreover, this Court\u2019s decisions do not\nsupport the respondents\u2019 and the Government\u2019s position.\n   Respondents and the United States point out that Smi-\nley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355 (1932), mentioned \u201cregistration\u201d\nin a list of voting-related subjects it believed Congress\ncould regulate under Article I, \u00a74. Id., at 366 (listing\n\u201cnotices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of\nvoters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting\nof votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making\nand publication of election returns\u201d (emphasis added)).\nSee Brief for ITCA Respondents 49; Brief for Gonzalez\nRespondents 48; Brief for United States 21. But that\nstatement was dicta because Smiley involved congres-\nsional redistricting, not voter registration. 285 U. S., at\n361\u2013362. Cases since Smiley have similarly not addressed\nthe issue of voter qualifications but merely repeated the\nword \u201cregistration\u201d without further analysis. See Cook v.\nGralike, 531 U. S. 510, 523 (2001); Roudebush v. Hartke,\n405 U. S. 15, 24 (1972).\n   Moreover, in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970),\na majority of this Court, \u201ctook the position that [Article I,\n\u00a74,] did not confer upon Congress the power to regulate\nvoter qualifications in federal elections,\u201d as the majority\nrecognizes.

S. Term Limits,\nfrom which I dissented, recognized that Madison\u2019s Feder-\nalist No. 52 \u201cexplicitly contrasted the state control over the\nqualifications of electors\u201d with what it believed was \u201cthe\n14      ARIZONA v.

Most of the remaining\ncases cited by respondents and the Government merely\nconfirm that Congress\u2019 power to regulate the \u201cManner\nof holding Elections\u201d is limited to regulating events sur-\nrounding the when, where, and how of actually casting\nballots. See, e.g., United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299\n(1941) (upholding federal regulation of ballot fraud in\nprimary voting); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884)\n(upholding federal penalties for intimidating voter in\ncongressional election); see also Foster v. Love, 522 U. S.\n67 (1997) (overturning Louisiana primary system whose\nwinner was deemed elected if he received a majority of\nvotes in light of federal law setting the date of federal\ngeneral elections); Roudebush, supra (upholding Indiana\nballot recount procedures in close Senate election as within\nstate power under Article I, \u00a74). It is, thus, difficult to\nmaintain that the Times, Places and Manner Clause gives\nCongress power beyond regulating the casting of ballots\nand related activities, even as a matter of precedent.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 ArticleI, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4, and the Seventeenth Amendment concern con-\ngressional elections. The NVRA\u2019s \u201caccept and use\u201d requirement applies\nto all federal elections, even presidential elections. See \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(1). This Court has recognized, however, that \u201cthe state legisla-\nture\u2019s power to select the manner for appointing [presidential] electors\nis plenary; it may, if it chooses, select the electors itself.\u201d Bush v.

Legislatures in Florida in 1868 and\nColorado in 1876 chose delegates, id., at 822, and in recent memory, the\nFlorida Legislature in 2000 convened a special session to consider how\nto allocate its 25 electoral votes if the winner of the popular vote was\nnot determined in time for delegates to participate in the electoral\ncollege, see James, Election 2000: Florida Legislature Faces Own\nDisputes over Electors, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 2000, p.

Nor has it alleged that Congress\nlacks authority to direct the EAC to create the federal\nform. As a result, I need not address those issues. Ari-\nzona did, however, argue that respondent\u2019s interpretation\nof \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) would raise constitutional concerns. As\ndiscussed, supra, I too am concerned that respondent\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) would render the statute\nunconstitutional under Article I, \u00a72. Accordingly, I would\ninterpret \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) to avoid the constitutional prob-\nlems discussed above. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S.\n678, 689 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is a cardinal principle\u2019 of statutory\ninterpretation, however, that when an Act of Congress\nraises \u2018a serious doubt\u2019 as to its constitutionality, \u2018this\nCourt will first ascertain whether a construction of the\nstatute is fairly possible by which the question may be\navoided\u2019 \u201d (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62\n(1932))).\n   I cannot, therefore, adopt the Court\u2019s interpretation that\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1)\u2019s \u201caccept and use\u201d provision requires\nstates to register anyone who completes and submits the\nform. Arizona sets citizenship as a qualification to vote,\nand it wishes to verify citizenship, as it is authorized to do\nunder Article 1, \u00a72. It matters not whether the United\nStates has specified one way in which it believes Arizona\nmight be able to verify citizenship; Arizona has the inde-\npendent constitutional authority to verify citizenship in\nthe way it deems necessary. See in Part II\u2013A\u20132, supra.\nBy requiring Arizona to register people who have not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nWithout Naming Electors, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 15, 2000, p. A6. \n\nConstitutional avoidance is especially appropriate in this area because \n\nthe NVRA purports to regulate presidential elections, an area over \n\nwhich the Constitution gives Congress no authority whatsoever. \n\n16    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndemonstrated to Arizona\u2019s satisfaction that they meet its\ncitizenship qualification for voting, the NVRA, as inter-\npreted by the Court, would exceed Congress\u2019 powers under\nArticle I, \u00a74, and violate Article 1, \u00a72.\n   Fortunately, Arizona\u2019s alternative interpretation of\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) avoids this problem. It is plausible that\nArizona \u201caccept[s] and use[s]\u201d the federal form under\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) so long as it receives the form and consid-\ners it as part of its voter application process.

Given States\u2019 exclu-\nsive authority to set voter qualifications and to determine\nwhether those qualifications are met, I would hold that\nArizona may request whatever additional information it\nrequires to verify voter eligibility.\n                              B\n   The majority purports to avoid the difficult constitu-\ntional questions implicated by the Voter Qualifications\nClause. See ante, at 13\u201315. It nevertheless adopts re-\nspondents\u2019 reading of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) because it inter-\nprets Article I, \u00a72, as giving Arizona the right only to\n\u201cobtai[n] information necessary for enforcement\u201d of its\nvoting qualifications.

I would not require\nArizona to seek approval for its registration requirements\nfrom the Federal Government, for, as I have shown, the\nFederal Government does not have the constitutional\nauthority to withhold such approval. Accordingly, it does\nnot have the authority to command States to seek it. As\na result, the majority\u2019s proposed solution does little to\navoid the serious constitutional problems created by its\ninterpretation.\n                          *    *   *\n   Instead of adopting respondents\u2019 definition of \u201caccept\nand use\u201d and offering Arizona the dubious recourse of\nbringing an APA challenge within the NVRA framework,\nI would adopt an interpretation of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) that\navoids the constitutional problems with respondents\u2019 in-\nterpretation. The States, not the Federal Government,\nhave the exclusive right to define the \u201cQualifications\nrequisite for Electors,\u201d U. S. Const., Art.

See Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 1\n(House); Amdt. 17 (Senate). The States also have the\ndefault authority to regulate federal voter registration.\nSee Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1. Exercising its right to set federal voter\nqualifications, Arizona, like every other State, permits\nonly U. S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and Arizona\nhas concluded that this requirement cannot be effectively\nenforced unless applicants for registration are required to\nprovide proof of citizenship. According to the Court, how-\never, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)\ndeprives Arizona of this authority. I do not think that this\nis what Congress intended.\n   I also doubt that Congress meant for the success of\nan application for voter registration to depend on which of\ntwo valid but substantially different registration forms the\napplicant happens to fill out and submit, but that is how\nthe Court reads the NVRA. The Court interprets one\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), to mean that, if\nan applicant fills out the federal form, a State must regis-\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nter the applicant without requiring proof of citizenship.\nBut the Court does not question Arizona\u2019s authority under\nanother provision of the NVRA, \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2), to create\nits own application form that demands proof of citizen-\nship; nor does the Court dispute Arizona\u2019s right to refuse\nto register an applicant who submits that form without the\nrequisite proof. I find it very hard to believe that this is\nwhat Congress had in mind.\n   These results are not required by the NVRA. Proper\nrespect for the constitutional authority of the States de-\nmands a clear indication of a congressional intent to pre-\nempt state laws enforcing voter qualifications. And while\nthe relevant provisions of the Act are hardly models of\nclarity, their best reading is that the States need not\ntreat the federal form as a complete voter registration\napplication.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   In light of the States\u2019 authority under the Elections\nClause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1, I would begin\nby applying a presumption against pre-emption of the\nArizona law requiring voter registration applicants to\nsubmit proof of citizenship. Under the Elections Clause,\nthe States have the authority to specify the times, places,\nand manner of federal elections except to the extent that\nCongress chooses to provide otherwise. And in recognition\nof this allocation of authority, it is appropriate to presume\nthat the States retain this authority unless Congress has\nclearly manifested a contrary intent. The Court states\nthat \u201c[w]e have never mentioned [the presumption against\npre-emption] in our Elections Clause cases,\u201d ante, at 10,\nbut in United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), we\nread a federal statute narrowly out of deference to the\nStates\u2019 traditional authority in this area. In doing so, we\nexplained that \u201cthe policy of Congress for [a] great . . . part\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nof our constitutional life has been . . . to leave the conduct\nof the election of its members to state laws, administered\nby state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to\nregulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 485 (emphasis added).1 The presumption\nagainst pre-emption applies with full force when Congress\nlegislates in a \u201cfield which the States have traditionally\noccupied,\u201d Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,\n230 (1947), and the NVRA was the first significant federal\nregulation of voter registration enacted under the Elec-\ntions Clause since Reconstruction.\n   The Court has it exactly backwards when it declines to\napply the presumption against pre-emption because \u201cthe\nfederalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Su-\npremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker\u201d in an Elec-\ntions Clause case like this one. Ante, at 12. To the\ncontrary, Arizona has a \u201c \u2018compelling interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its election process\u2019 \u201d that the Constitution\nrecognizes and that the Court\u2019s reading of the Act seri-\nously undermines. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006)\n(per curiam) (quoting Eu v. San Francisco County Demo-\ncratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989)).\n   By reserving to the States default responsibility for\nadministering federal elections, the Elections Clause\nprotects several critical values that the Court disregards.\nFirst, as Madison explained in defense of the Elections\nClause at the Virginia Convention, \u201c[i]t was found neces-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court argues that Gradwell is irrelevant, observing that there\n\nwas no state law directly at issue in that case, which concerned a pros-\necution under a federal statute. Ante, at 10, n. 5. But the same is\ntrue of Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371 (1880), on which the Court relies\nin the very next breath. In any event, it is hard to see why a presump-\ntion about the effect of federal law on the conduct of congressional\nelections should have less force when the federal law is alleged to\nconflict with a state law. If anything, one would expect the opposite\nto be true.\n4     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the\nfirst place, to the state governments, as being best ac-\nquainted with the situation of the people.\u201d 3 Records of\nthe Federal Convention of 1787, p. 312 (M. Farrand ed.\n1911). Because the States are closer to the people, the\nFramers thought that state regulation of federal elections\nwould \u201cin ordinary cases . . . be both more convenient and\nmore satisfactory.\u201d The Federalist No. 59, p. 360 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\n   Second, as we have previously observed, the integrity of\nfederal elections is a subject over which the States and the\nFederal Government \u201care mutually concerned.\u201d Ex parte\nSiebold, 100 U. S. 371, 391 (1880). By giving States a role\nin the administration of federal elections, the Elections\nClause reflects the States\u2019 interest in the selection of the\nindividuals on whom they must rely to represent their\ninterests in the National Legislature. See U. S. Term\nLimits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 858\u2013859 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   Third, the Elections Clause\u2019s default rule helps to pro-\ntect the States\u2019 authority to regulate state and local elec-\ntions. As a practical matter, it would be very burdensome\nfor a State to maintain separate federal and state registra-\ntion processes with separate federal and state voter rolls.\nFor that reason, any federal regulation in this area is\nlikely to displace not only state control of federal elections\nbut also state control of state and local elections.\n   Needless to say, when Congress believes that some\noverriding national interest justifies federal regulation, it\nhas the power to \u201cmake or alter\u201d state laws specifying the\n\u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of federal elections. Art. I,\n\u00a74, cl. 1. But we should expect Congress to speak clearly\nwhen it decides to displace a default rule enshrined in\nthe text of the Constitution that serves such important\npurposes.\n   The Court answers that when Congress exercises its\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npower under the Elections Clause \u201cit necessarily displaces\nsome element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the\nStates.\u201d Ante, at 11. But the same is true whenever\nCongress legislates in an area of concurrent state and fed-\neral power. A federal law regulating the operation of\ngrain warehouses, for example, necessarily alters the\n\u201cpre-existing legal regime erected by the States,\u201d see Rice,\nsupra, at 229\u2013230\u2014even if only by regulating an activity\nthe States had chosen not to constrain.2 In light of Ari-\nzona\u2019s constitutionally codified interest in the integrity of\nits federal elections, \u201cit is incumbent upon the federal courts\nto be certain\u201d that Congress intended to pre-empt Ari-\nzona\u2019s law. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S.\n234, 243 (1985).\n                           B\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance also counsels\nagainst the Court\u2019s reading of the Act. As the Court\nacknowledges, the Constitution reserves for the States the\npower to decide who is qualified to vote in federal elec-\ntions. Ante, at 13\u201315; see Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.\n112, 210\u2013211 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Court also recognizes that, al-\nthough Congress generally has the authority to regulate\nthe \u201cTimes, Places and Manner of holding\u201d such elections,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court observes that the Commerce Clause, unlike the Elections\n\nClause, empowers Congress to legislate in areas that do not implicate\nconcurrent state power. Ante, at 12, n. 6. Apparently the Court means\nthat the presumption against pre-emption only applies in those unus-\nual cases in which it is unclear whether a federal statute even touches on\nsubject matter that the States may regulate under their broad police\npowers. I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by this cramped\nunderstanding of the presumption against pre-emption. See, e.g.,\nHillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (\u201cThere is\ntherefore \u2018a presumption against pre-emption\u2019 of state laws governing\ndomestic relations\u201d (quoting Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 151\n(2001)).\n6      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nArt. I, \u00a74, cl. 1, a federal law that frustrates a State\u2019s\nability to enforce its voter qualifications would be constitu-\ntionally suspect. Ante, at 15; see ante, at 4\u20138 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court nevertheless reads the NVRA to\nrestrict Arizona\u2019s ability to enforce its law providing that\nonly United States citizens may vote. See Ariz. Const.,\nArt. VII, \u00a72. We are normally more reluctant to inter-\npret federal statutes as upsetting \u201cthe usual constitutional\nbalance of federal and state powers.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft,\n501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991); see Frankfurter, Some Reflec-\ntions on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527,\n540 (1947) (\u201c[W]hen the Federal Government . . . radically\nreadjusts the balance of state and national authority,\nthose charged with the duty of legislating are reasonably\nexplicit\u201d).\n   In refusing to give any weight to Arizona\u2019s interest in\nenforcing its voter qualifications, the Court suggests that\nthe State could return to the Election Assistance Com-\nmission and renew its request for a change to the federal\nform. Ante, at 16\u201317. But that prospect does little to\nassuage constitutional concerns. The EAC currently has\nno members, and there is no reason to believe that it will\nbe restored to life in the near future. If that situation\npersists, Arizona\u2019s ability to obtain a judicial resolution of\nits constitutional claim is problematic. The most that the\nCourt is prepared to say is that the State \u201cmight\u201d succeed\nby seeking a writ of mandamus, and failing that, \u201cmight\u201d\nbe able to mount a constitutional challenge. Ante, at 17,\nn. 10. The Court sends the State to traverse a veritable\nprocedural obstacle course in the hope of obtaining a\njudicial decision on the constitutionality of the relevant\nprovisions of the NVRA. A sensible interpretation of the\nAct would obviate these difficulties.\n                          II\n    The NVRA does not come close to manifesting the clear\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nintent to pre-empt that we should expect to find when\nCongress has exercised its Elections Clause power in a\nway that is constitutionally questionable. Indeed, even if\nneither the presumption against pre-emption nor the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance applied, the better read-\ning of the Act would be that Arizona is free to require\nthose who use the federal form to supplement their appli-\ncations with proof of citizenship.\n  I agree with the Court that the phrase \u201caccept and use,\u201d\nwhen read in isolation, is ambiguous, ante, at 6\u20137, but\nI disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(1)\u2019s use of that phrase means that a State must treat\nthe federal form as a complete application and must either\ngrant or deny registration without requiring that the ap-\nplicant supply additional information. Instead, I would\nhold that a State \u201caccept[s] and use[s]\u201d the federal form so\nlong as it uses the form as a meaningful part of the regis-\ntration process.\n  The Court begins its analysis of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1)\u2019s con-\ntext by examining unrelated uses of the word \u201caccept\u201d\nelsewhere in the United States Code. Ante, at 7\u20138. But a\nbetter place to start is to ask what it normally means to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d an application form. When the phrase is\nused in that context, it is clear that an organization can\n\u201caccept and use\u201d a form that it does not treat as a complete\napplication. For example, many colleges and universities\naccept and use the Common Application for Undergradu-\nate College Admission but also require that applicants\nsubmit various additional forms or documents. See Com-\nmon Application, 2012\u20132013 College Deadlines, Fees, and\nRequirements, https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/\nMemberRequirements.aspx (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 10, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). Similarly, the Social Security Administration\nundoubtedly \u201caccepts and uses\u201d its Social Security card\napplication form even though someone applying for a card\n8     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmust also prove that he or she is a citizen or has a qualify-\ning immigration status. See Application for a Social Secu-\nrity Card, Form SS\u20135 (2011), http://www.socialsecurity.gov/\nonline/ss-5.pdf. As such examples illustrate, when an\norganization says that it \u201caccepts and uses\u201d an application\nform, it does not necessarily mean that the form consti-\ntutes a complete application.\n   That is not to say that the phrase \u201caccept and use\u201d is\nmeaningless when issued as a \u201cgovernment diktat\u201d in\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). Ante, at 7. Arizona could not be said to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d the federal form if it required applicants\nwho submit that form to provide all the same information\na second time on a separate state form. But Arizona does\nnothing of the kind. To the contrary, the entire basis for\nrespondents\u2019 suit is that Proposition 200 mandates that\napplicants provide information that does not appear on a\ncompleted federal form. Although \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) forbids\nStates from requiring applicants who use the federal\nform to submit a duplicative state form, nothing in that pro-\nvision\u2019s text prevents Arizona from insisting that federal\nform applicants supplement their applications with addi-\ntional information.\n   That understanding of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) is confirmed by\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2), which allows States to design and use\ntheir own voter registration forms \u201c[i]n addition to accept-\ning and using\u201d the federal form. The Act clearly permits\nStates to require proof of citizenship on their own forms,\nsee \u00a7\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2) and 1973gg\u20137(b)\u2014a step that Ari-\nzona has taken and that today\u2019s decision does not disturb.\nThus, under the Court\u2019s approach, whether someone can\nregister to vote in Arizona without providing proof of\ncitizenship will depend on the happenstance of which of\ntwo alternative forms the applicant completes. That could\nnot possibly be what Congress intended; it is as if the\nInternal Revenue Service issued two sets of personal\nincome tax forms with different tax rates.\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   We could avoid this nonsensical result by holding that\nthe Act lets the States decide for themselves what in-\nformation \u201cis necessary . . . to assess the eligibility of the\napplicant\u201d\u2014both by designing their own forms and by\nrequiring that federal form applicants provide supple-\nmental information when appropriate. \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1).\nThe Act\u2019s provision for state forms shows that the purpose\nof the federal form is not to supplant the States\u2019 authority\nin this area but to facilitate interstate voter registration\ndrives. Thanks to the federal form, volunteers distrib-\nuting voter registration materials at a shopping mall in\nYuma can give a copy of the same form to every person\nthey meet without attempting to distinguish between\nresidents of Arizona and California. See H. R. Rep. No.\n103\u20139, p. 10 (1993) (\u201cUniform mail forms will permit voter\nregistration drives through a regional or national mailing,\nor for more than one State at a central location, such as a\ncity where persons from a number of neighboring States\nwork, shop or attend events\u201d). The federal form was\nmeant to facilitate voter registration drives, not to take\naway the States\u2019 traditional authority to decide what\ninformation registrants must supply.3\n   The Court purports to find support for its contrary\napproach in \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), which says that a State\nmust \u201censure that any eligible applicant is registered to\nvote in an election . . . if the valid voter registration form\nof the applicant is postmarked\u201d within a specified period.\nAnte, at 8\u20139. The Court understands \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B)\nto mean that a State must register an eligible applicant if\nhe or she submits a \u201c \u2018valid voter registration form.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court argues that the federal form would not accomplish this\n\npurpose under my interpretation because \u201ca volunteer in Yuma would\nhave to give every prospective voter not only a Federal Form, but also\na separate set of either Arizona- or California-specific instructions.\u201d\nAnte, at 10, n. 4. But this is exactly what Congress envisioned. Eigh-\nteen of the federal form\u2019s 23 pages are state-specific instructions.\n10    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nat 9. But when read in context, that provision simply\nidentifies the time within which a State must process\nregistration applications; it says nothing about whether\na State may require the submission of supplemental in-\nformation. The Court\u2019s more expansive interpretation of\n\u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) sneaks in a qualification that is no-\nwhere to be found in the text. The Court takes pains to\nsay that a State need not register an applicant who\nproperly completes and submits a federal form but is\nknown by the State to be ineligible. See ante, at 12\u201313.\nBut the Court takes the position that a State may not\ndemand that an applicant supply any additional infor-\nmation to confirm voting eligibility. Nothing in \u00a71973gg\u2013\n6(a)(1)(B) supports this distinction.\n   What is a State to do if it has reason to doubt an appli-\ncant\u2019s eligibility but cannot be sure that the applicant is\nineligible? Must the State either grant or deny registra-\ntion without communicating with the applicant? Or does\nthe Court believe that a State may ask for additional\ninformation in individual cases but may not impose a\ncategorical requirement for all applicants? If that is the\nCourt\u2019s position, on which provision of the NVRA does it\nrely? The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) is atex-\ntual and makes little sense.\n                          *     *     *\n  Properly interpreted, the NVRA permits Arizona to\nrequire applicants for federal voter registration to provide\nproof of eligibility. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued March 18, 2013\u2014Decided June 17, 2013\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires States to\n  \u201caccept and use\u201d a uniform federal form to register voters for federal\n  elections. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). That \u201cFederal Form,\u201d devel-\n  oped by the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC), requires\n  only that an applicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a cit-\n  izen. Arizona law, however, requires voter-registration officials to\n  \u201creject\u201d any application for registration, including a Federal Form,\n  that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship. Re-\n  spondents, a group of individual Arizona residents and a group of\n  nonprofit organizations, sought to enjoin that Arizona law. Ultimate-\n  ly, the District Court granted Arizona summary judgment on re-\n  spondents\u2019 claim that the NVRA pre-empts Arizona\u2019s requirement.\n  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed as relevant here,\n  holding that the state law\u2019s documentary-proof-of-citizenship re-\n  quirement is pre-empted by the NVRA.\nHeld: Arizona\u2019s evidence-of-citizenship requirement, as applied to Fed-\n eral Form applicants, is pre-empted by the NVRA\u2019s mandate that\n States \u201caccept and use\u201d the Federal Form. Pp. 4\u201318.\n    (a) The Elections Clause imposes on States the duty to prescribe\n the time, place, and manner of electing Representatives and Sena-\n tors, but it confers on Congress the power to alter those regulations\n or supplant them altogether.

The implication of such a mandate is that its object\n    is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satis-\n    fy. Arizona\u2019s reading is also difficult to reconcile with neighboring\n    NVRA provisions, such as \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) and \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2).\n       Arizona\u2019s appeal to the presumption against pre-emption invoked\n    in this Court\u2019s Supremacy Clause cases is inapposite. The power the\n    Elections Clause confers is none other than the power to pre-empt.\n    Because Congress, when it acts under this Clause, is always on notice\n    that its legislation will displace some element of a pre-existing legal\n    regime erected by the States, the reasonable assumption is that the\n    text of Elections Clause legislation accurately communicates the\n    scope of Congress\u2019s pre-emptive intent.\n       Nonetheless, while the NVRA forbids States to demand that an ap-\n    plicant submit additional information beyond that required by the\n    Federal Form, it does not preclude States from \u201cdeny[ing] registra-\n    tion based on information in their possession establishing the appli-\n    cant\u2019s ineligibility.\u201d Pp. 6\u201313.\n       (c) Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress\n    to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in\n    them. The latter is the province of the States. See U. S. Const., Art.\n    I, \u00a72, cl. 1; Amdt. 17. It would raise serious constitutional doubts if a\n    federal statute precluded a State from obtaining the information nec-\n    essary to enforce its voter qualifications. The NVRA can be read to\n    avoid such a conflict, however. Section 1973gg\u20137(b)(1) permits the\n    EAC to include on the Federal Form information \u201cnecessary to enable\n    the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the\n    applicant.\u201d That validly conferred discretionary executive authority\n    is properly exercised (as the Government has proposed) to require the\n    inclusion of Arizona\u2019s concrete-evidence requirement if such evidence\n    is necessary to enable Arizona to enforce its citizenship qualification.\n       The NVRA permits a State to request the EAC to include state-\n    specific instructions on the Federal Form, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u2013\n    7(a)(2), and a State may challenge the EAC\u2019s rejection of that request\n    (or failure to act on it) in a suit under the Administrative Procedure\n    Act. That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to\n    determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.\n    Should the EAC reject or decline to act on a renewed request, Arizona\n    would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that a\n    mere oath will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement\n    and that the EAC is therefore under a nondiscretionary duty to in-\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

THE INTER \n\n     TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZONA, INC., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 17, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The National Voter Registration Act requires States to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d a uniform federal form to register voters\nfor federal elections. The contents of that form (colloquially\nknown as the Federal Form) are prescribed by a federal\nagency, the Election Assistance Commission. The Federal\nForm developed by the EAC does not require documentary\nevidence of citizenship; rather, it requires only that an\napplicant aver, under penalty of perjury, that he is a\ncitizen. Arizona law requires voter-registration officials to\n\u201creject\u201d any application for registration, including a Fed-\neral Form, that is not accompanied by concrete evidence of\ncitizenship. The question is whether Arizona\u2019s evidence-\nof-citizenship requirement, as applied to Federal Form\napplicants, is pre-empted by the Act\u2019s mandate that States\n\u201caccept and use\u201d the Federal Form.\n                            I\n   Over the past two decades, Congress has erected a\ncomplex superstructure of federal regulation atop state\nvoter-registration systems. The National Voter Registra-\ntion Act of 1993 (NVRA), 107 Stat. 77, as amended, 42\n2      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nU. S. C. \u00a71973gg et seq., \u201crequires States to provide simpli-\nfied systems for registering to vote in federal elections.\u201d\nYoung v. Fordice, 520 U. S. 273, 275 (1997). The Act\nrequires each State to permit prospective voters to \u201cregis-\nter to vote in elections for Federal office\u201d by any of three\nmethods: simultaneously with a driver\u2019s license applica-\ntion, in person, or by mail. \u00a71973gg\u20132(a).\n   This case concerns registration by mail.           Section\n1973gg\u20132(a)(2) of the Act requires a State to establish\nprocedures for registering to vote in federal elections \u201cby\nmail application pursuant to section 1973gg\u20134 of this\ntitle.\u201d Section 1973gg\u20134, in turn, requires States to \u201cac-\ncept and use\u201d a standard federal registration form.\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). The Election Assistance Commission is\ninvested with rulemaking authority to prescribe the con-\ntents of that Federal Form. \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(1); see \u00a715329.1\nThe EAC is explicitly instructed, however, to develop the\nFederal Form \u201cin consultation with the chief election\nofficers of the States.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2). The Federal Form\nthus contains a number of state-specific instructions,\nwhich tell residents of each State what additional infor-\nmation they must provide and where they must submit\nthe form. See National Mail Voter Registration Form, pp.\n3\u201320, online at http://www.eac.gov (all Internet materials\nas visited June 11, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file); 11 CFR \u00a79428.3 (2012). Each state-specific\ninstruction must be approved by the EAC before it is\nincluded on the Federal Form.\n   To be eligible to vote under Arizona law, a person must\nbe a citizen of the United States. Ariz. Const., Art. VII, \u00a72;\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013101(A) (West 2006). This case\nconcerns Arizona\u2019s efforts to enforce that qualification. In\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The Help America Vote Act of 2002 transferred this function from\n\nthe Federal Election Commission to the EAC.

Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 2\n(2006) (per curiam).2 Proposition 200 amended the State\u2019s\nelection code to require county recorders to \u201creject any\napplication for registration that is not accompanied by\nsatisfactory evidence of United States citizenship.\u201d Ariz.\nRev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F) (West Supp. 2012). The proof-\nof-citizenship requirement is satisfied by (1) a photocopy of\nthe applicant\u2019s passport or birth certificate, (2) a driver\u2019s\nlicense number, if the license states that the issuing au-\nthority verified the holder\u2019s U. S. citizenship, (3) evidence\nof naturalization, (4) tribal identification, or (5) \u201c[o]ther\ndocuments or methods of proof . . . established pursuant to\nthe Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\u201d Ibid.\nThe EAC did not grant Arizona\u2019s request to include this\nnew requirement among the state-specific instructions\nfor Arizona on the Federal Form. App. 225. Conse-\nquently, the Federal Form includes a statutorily required\nattestation, subscribed to under penalty of perjury, that\nan Arizona applicant meets the State\u2019s voting require-\nments (including the citizenship requirement), see\n\u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(2), but does not require concrete evidence of\ncitizenship.\n   The two groups of plaintiffs represented here\u2014a group\nof individual Arizona residents (dubbed the Gonzalez\nplaintiffs, after lead plaintiff Jesus Gonzalez) and a group\nof nonprofit organizations led by the Inter Tribal Council\nof Arizona (ITCA)\u2014filed separate suits seeking to enjoin\nthe voting provisions of Proposition 200.

Upon the\nStates it imposes the duty (\u201cshall be prescribed\u201d) to pre-\nscribe the time, place, and manner of electing Representa-\ntives and Senators; upon Congress it confers the power to\nalter those regulations or supplant them altogether. See\nU. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 804\u2013\n805 (1995); id., at 862 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). This\ngrant of congressional power was the Framers\u2019 insurance\nagainst the possibility that a State would refuse to provide\nfor the election of representatives to the Federal Congress.\n\u201c[E]very government ought to contain in itself the means\nof its own preservation,\u201d and \u201can exclusive power of regu-\nlating elections for the national government, in the hands\nof the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the\nUnion entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment\nannihilate it by neglecting to provide for the choice of\npersons to administer its affairs.\u201d The Federalist No. 59,\npp. 362\u2013363 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (empha-\nsis deleted). That prospect seems fanciful today, but the\nwidespread, vociferous opposition to the proposed Consti-\ntution made it a very real concern in the founding era.\n   The Clause\u2019s substantive scope is broad. \u201cTimes, Places,\nand Manner,\u201d we have written, are \u201ccomprehensive\nwords,\u201d which \u201cembrace authority to provide a complete\ncode for congressional elections,\u201d including, as relevant\nhere and as petitioners do not contest, regulations relat-\ning to \u201cregistration.\u201d Smiley v.

Love, 522 U. S. 67, 69 (1997) (citation\nomitted). The power of Congress over the \u201cTimes, Places\nand Manner\u201d of congressional elections \u201cis paramount, and\nmay be exercised at any time, and to any extent which it\ndeems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and no\nfarther, the regulations effected supersede those of the\nState which are inconsistent therewith.\u201d Ex parte Siebold,\n100 U. S. 371, 392 (1880).\n                              B\n  The straightforward textual question here is whether\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F), which requires state\nofficials to \u201creject\u201d a Federal Form unaccompanied by\ndocumentary evidence of citizenship, conflicts with the\nNVRA\u2019s mandate that Arizona \u201caccept and use\u201d the Fed-\neral Form. If so, the state law, \u201cso far as the conflict ex-\ntends, ceases to be operative.\u201d Siebold, supra, at 384. In\nArizona\u2019s view, these seemingly incompatible obligations\ncan be read to operate harmoniously: The NVRA, it con-\ntends, requires merely that a State receive the Federal\nForm willingly and use that form as one element in its\n(perhaps lengthy) transaction with a prospective voter.\n  Taken in isolation, the mandate that a State \u201caccept and\nuse\u201d the Federal Form is fairly susceptible of two inter-\npretations. It might mean that a State must accept the\nFederal Form as a complete and sufficient registration ap-\nplication; or it might mean that the State is merely required\nto receive the form willingly and use it somehow in its\nvoter registration process. Both readings\u2014\u201creceive will-\ningly\u201d and \u201caccept as sufficient\u201d\u2014are compatible with the\nplain meaning of the word \u201caccept.\u201d See 1 Oxford English\nDictionary 70 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cTo take or receive (a thing\noffered) willingly\u201d; \u201cTo receive as sufficient or adequate\u201d);\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary 14 (2d ed. 1954)\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

And\nreading \u201caccept\u201d merely to denote willing receipt seems\nout of place in the context of an official mandate to accept\nand use something for a given purpose. The implication of\nsuch a mandate is that its object is to be accepted as suffi-\ncient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy. For exam-\nple, a government diktat that \u201ccivil servants shall accept\ngovernment IOUs for payment of salaries\u201d does not invite\nthe response, \u201csure, we\u2019ll accept IOUs\u2014if you pay us a ten\npercent down payment in cash.\u201d Many federal statutes\ncontain similarly phrased commands, and they contem-\nplate more than mere willing receipt.

These state-developed\nforms may require information the Federal Form does not.\n(For example, unlike the Federal Form, Arizona\u2019s registra-\ntion form includes Proposition 200\u2019s proof-of-citizenship\nrequirement. See Arizona Voter Registration Form, p. 1,\nonline at http://www.azsos.gov.) This permission works in\ntandem with the requirement that States \u201caccept and use\u201d\nthe Federal Form. States retain the flexibility to design\nand use their own registration forms, but the Federal\nForm provides a backstop: No matter what procedural\nhurdles a State\u2019s own form imposes, the Federal Form\nguarantees that a simple means of registering to vote in\nfederal elections will be available.4 Arizona\u2019s reading\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 In the face of this straightforward explanation, the dissent main-\ntains that it would be \u201cnonsensical\u201d for a less demanding federal form\nto exist alongside a more demanding state form. Post, at 9 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). But it is the dissent\u2019s alternative explanation for \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(2) that makes no sense. The \u201cpurpose\u201d of the Federal Form, it\nclaims, is \u201cto facilitate interstate voter registration drives. Thanks to\nthe federal form, volunteers distributing voter registration materials at\na shopping mall in Yuma can give a copy of the same form to every\nperson they meet without attempting to distinguish between residents\nof Arizona and California.\u201d Post, at 9. But in the dissent\u2019s world, a\nvolunteer in Yuma would have to give every prospective voter not only\n10      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwould permit a State to demand of Federal Form appli-\ncants every additional piece of information the State\nrequires on its state-specific form. If that is so, the Fed-\neral Form ceases to perform any meaningful function, and\nwould be a feeble means of \u201cincreas[ing] the number of\neligible citizens who register to vote in elections for Federal\noffice.\u201d \u00a71973gg(b).\n   Finally, Arizona appeals to the presumption against\npre-emption sometimes invoked in our Supremacy Clause\ncases. See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460\u2013\n461 (1991). Where it applies, \u201cwe start with the assump-\ntion that the historic police powers of the States were not\nto be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the\nclear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Rice v. Santa Fe\nElevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947). That rule of\nconstruction rests on an assumption about congressional\nintent: that \u201cCongress does not exercise lightly\u201d the \u201cex-\ntraordinary power\u201d to \u201clegislate in areas traditionally\nregulated by the States.\u201d Gregory, supra, at 460. We have\nnever mentioned such a principle in our Elections Clause\ncases.5 Siebold, for example, simply said that Elections\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\na Federal Form, but also a separate set of either Arizona- or California-\nspecific instructions detailing the additional information the applicant\nmust submit to the State. In ours, every eligible voter can be assured\nthat if he does what the Federal Form says, he will be registered. The\ndissent therefore provides yet another compelling reason to interpret\nthe statute our way.\n  5 United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), on which the dis-\n\nsent relies, see post, at 3\u20134 (opinion of ALITO, J.), is not to the contrary\u2014\nindeed, it was not even a pre-emption case. In Gradwell, we held that\na statute making it a federal crime \u201cto defraud the United States\u201d\ndid not reach election fraud. 243 U. S., at 480, 483. The Court noted\nthat the provision at issue was adopted in a tax-enforcement bill, and\nthat Congress had enacted but then repealed other criminal statutes\nspecifically covering election fraud. Id., at 481\u2013483.\n  The dissent cherry-picks some language from a sentence in Gradwell,\nsee post, at 3\u20134, but the full sentence reveals its irrelevance to our case:\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nClause legislation, \u201cso far as it extends and conflicts with\nthe regulations of the State, necessarily supersedes them.\u201d\n100 U. S., at 384. There is good reason for treating Elec-\ntions Clause legislation differently: The assumption that\nCongress is reluctant to pre-empt does not hold when\nCongress acts under that constitutional provision, which\nempowers Congress to \u201cmake or alter\u201d state election regu-\nlations. Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1. When Congress legislates with\nrespect to the \u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of holding\ncongressional elections, it necessarily displaces some\nelement of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the\nStates.6 Because the power the Elections Clause confers is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n     \u201cWith it thus clearly established that the policy of Congress for so\n     great a part of our constitutional life has been, and now is, to\n     leave the conduct of the election of its members to state laws, ad-\n     ministered by state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to\n     regulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear stat-\n     utes, such as were enacted in 1870, it would be a strained and\n     unreasonable construction to apply to such elections this \u00a737, orig-\n     inally a law for the protection of the revenue and for now fifty\n     years confined in its application to \u2018Offenses against the Opera-\n     tions of the Government\u2019 as distinguished from the processes by\n     which men are selected to conduct such operations.\u201d 243 U. S., at\n     485.\nGradwell says nothing at all about pre-emption, or about how to con-\nstrue statutes (like the NVRA) in which Congress has indisputably\nundertaken \u201cto regulate such elections.\u201d Ibid.\n  6 The dissent counters that this is so \u201cwhenever Congress legislates in\n\nan area of concurrent state and federal power.\u201d Post, at 5 (opinion of\nALITO, J.). True, but irrelevant: Elections Clause legislation is unique\nprecisely because it always falls within an area of concurrent state and\nfederal power. Put differently, all action under the Elections Clause\ndisplaces some element of a pre-existing state regulatory regime,\nbecause the text of the Clause confers the power to do exactly (and only)\nthat. By contrast, even laws enacted under the Commerce Clause\n(arguably the other enumerated power whose exercise is most likely to\ntrench on state regulatory authority) will not always implicate concur-\nrent state power\u2014a prohibition on the interstate transport of a com-\nmodity, for example.\n12        ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nnone other than the power to pre-empt, the reasonable\nassumption is that the statutory text accurately communi-\ncates the scope of Congress\u2019s pre-emptive intent. More-\nover, the federalism concerns underlying the presumption\nin the Supremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker\nhere. Unlike the States\u2019 \u201chistoric police powers,\u201d Rice,\nsupra, at 230, the States\u2019 role in regulating congressional\nelections\u2014while weighty and worthy of respect\u2014has\nalways existed subject to the express qualification that it\n\u201cterminates according to federal law.\u201d Buckman Co. v.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., 531 U. S. 341, 347 (2001). In\nsum, there is no compelling reason not to read Elections\nClause legislation simply to mean what it says.\n  We conclude that the fairest reading of the statute is\nthat a state-imposed requirement of evidence of citizen-\nship not required by the Federal Form is \u201cinconsistent\nwith\u201d the NVRA\u2019s mandate that States \u201caccept and use\u201d\nthe Federal Form. Siebold, supra, at 397. If this reading\nprevails, the Elections Clause requires that Arizona\u2019s rule\ngive way.\n  We note, however, that while the NVRA forbids States\nto demand that an applicant submit additional infor-\nmation beyond that required by the Federal Form, it does\nnot preclude States from \u201cdeny[ing] registration based on\ninformation in their possession establishing the appli-\ncant\u2019s ineligibility.\u201d7 Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 24. The NVRA clearly contemplates that not every\nsubmitted Federal Form will result in registration. See\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  dissent seems to think this position of ours incompatible with\nour reading of \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), which requires a State to \u201censure\nthat any eligible applicant is registered to vote in an election . . . if the\nvalid voter registration form of the applicant is postmarked\u201d by a\ncertain date. See post, at 9\u201310 (opinion of ALITO, J.). What the dissent\noverlooks is that \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) only requires a State to register an\n\u201celigible applicant\u201d who submits a timely Federal Form.

The Constitution prescribes a\nstraightforward rule for the composition of the federal\nelectorate. Article I, \u00a72, cl. 1, provides that electors in\neach State for the House of Representatives \u201cshall have\nthe Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most nu-\nmerous Branch of the State Legislature,\u201d and the Seven-\nteenth Amendment adopts the same criterion for senatorial\nelections. Cf. also Art. II, \u00a71, cl. 2 (\u201cEach State shall\nappoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may\ndirect,\u201d presidential electors). One cannot read the Elec-\ntions Clause as treating implicitly what these other consti-\ntutional provisions regulate explicitly. \u201cIt is difficult to see\nhow words could be clearer in stating what Congress can\ncontrol and what it cannot control. Surely nothing in\nthese provisions lends itself to the view that voting quali-\nfications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.\u201d\nOregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 210 (1970) (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part); see also U. S.\nTerm Limits, 514 U. S., at 833\u2013834; Tashjian v. Republi-\ncan Party of Conn., 479 U.

INC.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nvens, J., dissenting).8\n  Prescribing voting qualifications, therefore, \u201cforms no\npart of the power to be conferred upon the national gov-\nernment\u201d by the Elections Clause, which is \u201cexpressly\nrestricted to the regulation of the times, the places, and\nthe manner of elections.\u201d The Federalist No. 60, at 371\n(A. Hamilton); see also id., No. 52, at 326 (J. Madison).\nThis allocation of authority sprang from the Framers\u2019\naversion to concentrated power. A Congress empowered\nto regulate the qualifications of its own electorate, Madi-\nson warned, could \u201cby degrees subvert the Constitution.\u201d\n2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 250\n(M. Farrand rev. 1966). At the same time, by tying the\nfederal franchise to the state franchise instead of simply\nplacing it within the unfettered discretion of state legisla-\ntures, the Framers avoided \u201crender[ing] too dependent on\nthe State governments that branch of the federal govern-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 In Mitchell, the judgment of the Court was that Congress could\n\ncompel the States to permit 18-year-olds to vote in federal elections. Of\nthe five Justices who concurred in that outcome, only Justice Black was\nof the view that congressional power to prescribe this age qualification\nderived from the Elections Clause, 400 U. S., at 119\u2013125, while four\nJustices relied on the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 144 (opinion of\nDouglas, J.), 231 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.).\nThat result, which lacked a majority rationale, is of minimal preceden-\ntial value here. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66\n(1996); Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994); H. Black,\nHandbook on the Law of Judicial Precedents 135\u2013136 (1912). Five\nJustices took the position that the Elections Clause did not confer upon\nCongress the power to regulate voter qualifications in federal elections.\nMitchell, supra, at 143 (opinion of Douglas, J.), 210 (opinion of Harlan,\nJ.), 288 (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun,\nJ.). (Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall did not address the\nElections Clause.) This last view, which commanded a majority in\nMitchell, underlies our analysis here. See also U. S. Term Limits, 514\nU. S., at 833. Five Justices also agreed that the Fourteenth Amend-\nment did not empower Congress to impose the 18-year-old-voting\nmandate. See Mitchell, supra, at 124\u2013130 (opinion of Black, J.), 155\n(opinion of Harlan, J.), 293\u2013294 (opinion of Stewart, J.).\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

Madison).\n   Since the power to establish voting requirements is of\nlittle value without the power to enforce those require-\nments, Arizona is correct that it would raise serious con-\nstitutional doubts if a federal statute precluded a State\nfrom obtaining the information necessary to enforce its\nvoter qualifications.9 If, but for Arizona\u2019s interpretation of\nthe \u201caccept and use\u201d provision, the State would be pre-\ncluded from obtaining information necessary for enforce-\nment, we would have to determine whether Arizona\u2019s\ninterpretation, though plainly not the best reading, is at\nleast a possible one. Cf. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22,\n62 (1932) (the Court will \u201cascertain whether a construction\nof the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional]\nquestion may be avoided\u201d (emphasis added)). Happily,\nwe are spared that necessity, since the statute provides\nanother means by which Arizona may obtain information\nneeded for enforcement.\n   Section 1973gg\u20137(b)(1) of the Act provides that the\nFederal Form \u201cmay require only such identifying infor-\nmation (including the signature of the applicant) and\nother information (including data relating to previous\nregistration by the applicant), as is necessary to enable\nthe appropriate State election official to assess the eligibil-\nity of the applicant and to administer voter registration\nand other parts of the election process.\u201d At oral argument,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 In their reply brief, petitioners suggest for the first time that \u201cregis-\n\ntration is itself a qualification to vote.\u201d Reply Brief for State Petition-\ners 24 (emphasis deleted); see also post, at 1, 16 (opinion of THOMAS, J.);\ncf. Voting Rights Coalition v. Wilson, 60 F. 3d 1411, 1413, and n. 1 (CA9\n1995), cert. denied, 516 U. S. 1093 (1996); Association of Community\nOrganizations for Reform Now (ACORN) v. Edgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 793\n(CA7 1995). We resolve this case on the theory on which it has hitherto\nbeen litigated: that citizenship (not registration) is the voter qualifica-\ntion Arizona seeks to enforce. See Brief for State Petitioners 50.\n16    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe United States expressed the view that the phrase\n\u201cmay require only\u201d in \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1) means that the\nEAC \u201cshall require information that\u2019s necessary, but may\nonly require that information.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 (em-\nphasis added); see also Brief for ITCA Respondents 46; Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 37\u201339 (ITCA Respondents\u2019 counsel). That is\nto say, \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1) acts as both a ceiling and a floor\nwith respect to the contents of the Federal Form. We need\nnot consider the Government\u2019s contention that despite the\nstatute\u2019s statement that the EAC \u201cmay\u201d require on the\nFederal Form information \u201cnecessary to enable the appro-\npriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the\napplicant,\u201d other provisions of the Act indicate that such\naction is statutorily required. That is because we think\nthat\u2014by analogy to the rule of statutory interpretation\nthat avoids questionable constitutionality\u2014validly con-\nferred discretionary executive authority is properly exer-\ncised (as the Government has proposed) to avoid serious\nconstitutional doubt. That is to say, it is surely permissi-\nble if not requisite for the Government to say that neces-\nsary information which may be required will be required.\n   Since, pursuant to the Government\u2019s concession, a State\nmay request that the EAC alter the Federal Form to in-\nclude information the State deems necessary to determine\neligibility, see \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 55 (United\nStates), and may challenge the EAC\u2019s rejection of that\nrequest in a suit under the Administrative Procedure Act,\nsee 5 U. S. C. \u00a7701\u2013706, no constitutional doubt is raised\nby giving the \u201caccept and use\u201d provision of the NVRA its\nfairest reading. That alternative means of enforcing its\nconstitutional power to determine voting qualifications\nremains open to Arizona here. In 2005, the EAC divided\n2-to-2 on the request by Arizona to include the evidence-of-\ncitizenship requirement among the state-specific instruc-\ntions on the Federal Form, App. 225, which meant that no\naction could be taken, see 42 U. S. C. \u00a715328 (\u201cAny action\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Arizona did not challenge\nthat agency action (or rather inaction) by seeking APA\nreview in federal court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\u201312 (Ari-\nzona), but we are aware of nothing that prevents Arizona\nfrom renewing its request.10 Should the EAC\u2019s inaction\npersist, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in\na reviewing court that a mere oath will not suffice to\neffectuate its citizenship requirement and that the EAC is\ntherefore under a nondiscretionary duty to include Ari-\nzona\u2019s concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form.\nSee 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706(1). Arizona might also assert (as it has\nargued here) that it would be arbitrary for the EAC to\nrefuse to include Arizona\u2019s instruction when it has accepted\na similar instruction requested by Louisiana.11\n                     *     *    *\n  We hold that 42 U.

Indeed, the whole request process appears to be\nentirely informal, Arizona\u2019s prior request having been submitted by\ne-mail. See App. 181.\n   The EAC currently lacks a quorum\u2014indeed, the Commission has not\na single active Commissioner. If the EAC proves unable to act on a\nrenewed request, Arizona would be free to seek a writ of mandamus to\n\u201ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\u201d 5\nU. S. C. \u00a7706(1). It is a nice point, which we need not resolve here,\nwhether a court can compel agency action that the agency itself, for\nlack of the statutorily required quorum, is incapable of taking. If the\nanswer to that is no, Arizona might then be in a position to assert a\nconstitutional right to demand concrete evidence of citizenship apart\nfrom the Federal Form.\n   11 The EAC recently approved a state-specific instruction for Louisi-\n\nana requiring applicants who lack a Louisiana driver\u2019s license, ID card,\nor Social Security number to attach additional documentation to the\ncompleted Federal Form.

S. 504, 545 (1992) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judg-\nment in part and dissenting in part), it should say so and\napply that skepticism across the board.\n   There are numerous instances in which Congress, in the\nundoubted exercise of its enumerated powers, has stated\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nits express purpose and intent to pre-empt state law. But\nthe Court has nonetheless recognized that \u201cwhen the text\nof a pre-emption clause is susceptible of more than one\nplausible reading, courts ordinarily \u2018accept the reading that\ndisfavors pre-emption.\u2019 \u201d Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555\nU. S. 70, 77 (2008) (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences\nLLC, 544 U. S. 431, 449 (2005)). This principle is best\nunderstood, perhaps, not as a presumption but as a cau-\ntionary principle to ensure that pre-emption does not go\nbeyond the strict requirements of the statutory command.\nThe principle has two dimensions: Courts must be careful\nnot to give an unduly broad interpretation to ambiguous\nor imprecise language Congress uses. And they must\nconfine their opinions to avoid overextending a federal\nstatute\u2019s pre-emptive reach. Error on either front may put\nat risk the validity and effectiveness of laws that Con-\ngress did not intend to disturb and that a State has\ndeemed important to its scheme of governance. That con-\ncern is the same regardless of the power Congress invokes,\nwhether it is, say, the commerce power, the war power,\nthe bankruptcy power, or the power to regulate federal\nelections under Article I, \u00a74.\n   Whether the federal statute concerns congressional\nregulation of elections or any other subject proper for\nCongress to address, a court must not lightly infer a con-\ngressional directive to negate the States\u2019 otherwise proper\nexercise of their sovereign power. This case illustrates the\npoint. The separate States have a continuing, essential\ninterest in the integrity and accuracy of the process used\nto select both state and federal officials. The States pay\nthe costs of holding these elections, which for practical\nreasons often overlap so that the two sets of officials are\nselected at the same time, on the same ballots, by the\nsame voters. It seems most doubtful to me to suggest that\nStates have some lesser concern when what is involved\nis their own historic role in the conduct of elections. As\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\nalready noted, it may be that a presumption against pre-\nemption is not the best formulation of this principle, but in\nall events the State\u2019s undoubted interest in the regulation\nand conduct of elections must be taken into account and\nought not to be deemed by this Court to be a subject of\nsecondary importance.\n  Here, in my view, the Court is correct to conclude that\nthe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 is unambigu-\nous in its pre-emption of Arizona\u2019s statute. For this rea-\nson, I concur in the judgment and join all of the Court\u2019s\nopinion except its discussion of the presumption against\npre-emption.

THE INTER \n\n     TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZONA, INC., ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                        [June 17, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting.\n   This case involves the federal requirement that States\n\u201caccept and use,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1), the federal\nvoter registration form created pursuant to the National\nVoter Registration Act (NVRA). The Court interprets\n\u201caccept and use,\u201d with minor exceptions, to require States\nto register any individual who completes and submits the\nfederal form. It, therefore, holds that \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) pre-\nempts an Arizona law requiring additional information\nto register. As the majority recognizes, ante, at 13\u201315,\nits decision implicates a serious constitutional issue\u2014\nwhether Congress has power to set qualifications for those\nwho vote in elections for federal office.\n   I do not agree, and I think that both the plain text\nand the history of the Voter Qualifications Clause, U. S.\nConst., Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment\nauthorize States to determine the qualifications of voters\nin federal elections, which necessarily includes the related\npower to determine whether those qualifications are satis-\nfied. To avoid substantial constitutional problems created\nby interpreting \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) to permit Congress to ef-\nfectively countermand this authority, I would construe\nthe law as only requiring Arizona to accept and use the\nform as part of its voter registration process, leaving the\nState free to request whatever additional information it\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndetermines is necessary to ensure that voters meet the\nqualifications it has the constitutional authority to estab-\nlish.   Under this interpretation, Arizona did \u201caccept\nand use\u201d the federal form. Accordingly, there is no con-\nflict between Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a716\u2013166(F) (West\nCum. Supp. 2012) and \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) and, thus, no\npre-emption.\n                               I\n   In 2002, Congress created the Election Assistance\nCommission (EAC), 42 U. S. C. \u00a715321 et seq., and gave\nit the ongoing responsibility of \u201cdevelop[ing] a mail voter\nregistration application form for elections for Federal\noffice\u201d \u201cin consultation with the chief election officers of\nthe States.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(a)(2). Under the NVRA, \u201c[e]ach\nState shall accept and use the mail voter registration\napplication form\u201d the EAC develops. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). The\nNVRA also states in a subsequent provision that \u201c[i]n\naddition to accepting and using the form described in\nparagraph (1), a State may develop and use a mail voter\nregistration form . . . for the registration of voters in elec-\ntions for Federal office\u201d so long as it satisfies the same\ncriteria as the federal form. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2).\n   Section 1973gg\u20137(b) enumerates the criteria for the fed-\neral form. The form \u201cmay require only such identifying in-\nformation . . . and other information . . . as is necessary\nto enable the appropriate State election official to assess\nthe eligibility of the applicant.\u201d \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1). The\nfederal form must also \u201cspecif[y] each eligibility require-\nment (including citizenship),\u201d \u201ccontai[n] an attestation\nthat the applicant meets each such requirement,\u201d and \u201cre-\nquir[e] the signature of the applicant, under penalty of\nperjury.\u201d \u00a7\u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(2)(A)\u2013(C). Insofar as citizenship\nis concerned, the standard federal form contains the bare\nstatutory requirements; individuals seeking to vote need\nonly attest that they are citizens and sign under penalty of\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Const., Art. VII,\n\u00a72. In 2004, Arizona citizens enacted Proposition 200, the\nlaw at issue in this case. Proposition 200 provides that\n\u201c[t]he county recorder shall reject any application for\nregistration that is not accompanied by satisfactory evi-\ndence of United States citizenship.\u201d Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a716\u2013166(F). The law sets forth several examples of satis-\nfactory evidence, including driver\u2019s license number, birth\ncertificate, U. S. passport, naturalization documents, and\nvarious tribal identification documents for Indians. \u00a716\u2013\n166(F)(1)\u2013(6).\n   Respondents, joined by the United States, allege that these\nstate requirements are pre-empted by the NVRA\u2019s man-\ndate that all States \u201caccept and use\u201d the federal form\npromulgated by the EAC. \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). They contend\nthat the phrase \u201caccept and use\u201d requires a State pre-\nsented with a completed federal form to register the individ-\nual to vote without requiring any additional information.\n   Arizona advances an alternative interpretation. It ar-\ngues that \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) is satisfied so long as the State\n\u201caccepts and use[s]\u201d the federal form as part of its voter\nqualification process. For example, a State \u201caccepts and\nuse[s]\u201d the federal form by allowing individuals to file it,\neven if the State requires additional identifying infor-\nmation to establish citizenship. In Arizona\u2019s view, it \u201cac-\ncepts and uses\u201d the federal form in the same way that\nan airline \u201caccepts and uses\u201d electronic tickets but also\nrequires an individual seeking to board a plane to demon-\nstrate that he is the person named on the ticket.

See 677 F. 3d, at 439 (Kozinski, C.J.,\nconcurring) (weighing the arguments). The competing\ninterpretations of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) raise significant consti-\ntutional issues concerning Congress\u2019 power to decide who\nmay vote in federal elections. Accordingly, resolution of\nthis case requires a better understanding of the relevant\nconstitutional provisions.\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   The Voter Qualifications Clause, U.

The Seventeenth\nAmendment, which provides for direct election of Senators,\ncontains an identical clause. That language is suscep-\ntible of only one interpretation: States have the author-\nity \u201cto control who may vote in congressional elections\u201d so\nlong as they do not \u201cestablish special requirements that do\nnot apply in elections for the state legislature.\u201d U.

This\npower is instead expressly reposed in the States.\n                             1\n   The history of the Voter Qualifications Clause\u2019s enact-\nment confirms this conclusion. The Framers did not intend\nto leave voter qualifications to Congress. Indeed, James\nMadison explicitly rejected that possibility:\n    \u201cThe definition of the right of suffrage is very justly\n    regarded as a fundamental article of republican govern-\n    ment. It was incumbent on the convention, therefore,\n    to define and establish this right in the Constitu-\n    tion. To have left it open for the occasional regulation\n    of the Congress would have been improper.\u201d The Fed-\n    eralist No. 52, at 323 (emphasis added).\nCongressional legislation of voter qualifications was not\npart of the Framers\u2019 design.\n   The Constitutional Convention did recognize a danger in\nleaving Congress \u201ctoo dependent on the State govern-\nments\u201d by allowing States to define congressional elector\nqualifications without limitation. Ibid. To address this\nconcern, the Committee of Detail that drafted Article I, \u00a72,\n\u201cweighed the possibility of a federal property requirement,\nas well as several proposals that would have given the\nfederal government the power to impose its own suffrage\nlaws at some future time.\u201d A. Keyssar, The Right to Vote\n18 (rev. ed. 2009) (hereafter Keyssar); see also 2 The Rec-\nords of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 139\u2013140, 151,\n153, 163\u2013165 (M. Farrand rev. ed. 1966) (text of several\nvoter qualification provisions considered by the Committee\nof Detail).\n   These efforts, however, were ultimately abandoned. Even\nif the convention had been able to agree on a uniform\nfederal standard, the Framers knew that state ratification\nconventions likely would have rejected it. Madison ex-\n6     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ.

Story, Commentaries on the Consti-\ntution of the United States 217 (abridged ed. 1833) (same).\nJustice Story elaborated that setting voter qualifications\nin the Constitution could have jeopardized ratification,\nbecause it would have been difficult to convince States to\ngive up their right to set voting qualifications. Id., at 216,\n218\u2013219. See also Keyssar 306\u2013313 (Tables A.1 and A.2)\n(state-by-state analysis of 18th- and 19th-century voter qual-\nifications, including property, taxpaying, residency, sex,\nand race requirements).\n   The Convention, thus, chose to respect the varied state\nvoting rules and instead struck the balance enshrined in\nArticle I, \u00a72\u2019s requirement that federal electors \u201cshall have\nthe Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numer-\nous Branch of the State Legislature.\u201d That compromise\ngave States free reign over federal voter qualifications\nbut protected Congress by prohibiting States from chang-\ning the qualifications for federal electors unless they also\naltered qualifications for their own legislatures. See The\nFederalist No. 52, at 323. This balance left the States\nwith nearly complete control over voter qualifications.\n                               2\n  Respondents appear to concede that States have the sole\nauthority to establish voter qualifications, see, e.g., Brief\nfor Gonzalez Respondents 63, but nevertheless argue that\nCongress can determine whether those qualifications are\nsatisfied. See, e.g., id., at 61. The practical effect of re-\nspondents\u2019 position is to read Article I, \u00a72, out of the Con-\nstitution. As the majority correctly recognizes, \u201cthe power\nto establish voting requirements is of little value without\nthe power to enforce those requirements.\u201d See ante, at 15.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nFor this reason, the Voter Qualifications Clause gives\nStates the authority not only to set qualifications but\nalso the power to verify whether those qualifications are\nsatisfied.\n   This understanding of Article I, \u00a72, is consistent with\npowers enjoyed by the States at the founding. For in-\nstance, ownership of real or personal property was a com-\nmon prerequisite to voting, see Keyssar 306\u2013313 (Tables\nA.1 and A.2). To verify that this qualification was satis-\nfied, States might look to proof of tax payments. See C.\nWilliamson, American Suffrage from Property to Democ-\nracy, 1760\u20131860, p. 32 (1960). In other instances, States\nrelied on personal knowledge of fellow citizens to verify\nvoter eligibility. Keyssar 24 (\u201cIn some locales, particularly\nin the South, voting was still an oral and public act: men\nassembled before election judges, waited for their names\nto be called, and then announced which candidates they\nsupported\u201d). States have always had the power to ensure\nthat only those qualified under state law to cast ballots\nexercised the franchise.\n   Perhaps in part because many requirements (such as\nproperty ownership or taxpayer status) were indepen-\ndently documented and verifiable, States in 1789 did not\ngenerally \u201cregister\u201d voters using highly formalized proce-\ndures. See id., at 122. Over time, States replaced their\ninformal systems for determining eligibility, with more\nformalized pre-voting registration regimes. See An Act in\nAddition to the Several Acts for Regulating Elections,\n1800 Mass. Acts ch. 74, in Acts and Laws of the Common-\nwealth of Massachusetts 96 (1897) (Massachusetts\u2019 1801\nvoter registration law). But modern voter registration\nserves the same basic purpose as the practices used by\nStates in the Colonies and early Federal Republic. The\nfact that States have liberalized voting qualifications and\nstreamlined the verification process through registration\ndoes not alter the basic fact that States possess broad\n8           ARIZONA v.

(emphasis deleted; footnote\nomitted). Consistent with this view, during the state\nratification debates, the \u201cManner of holding Elections\u201d was\nconstrued to mean the circumstances under which elec-\ntions were held and the mechanics of the actual election.\nSee 4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the\nAdoption of the Federal Constitution 71 (J.

The North Carolina debates provide a particu-\nlarly direct example. There, delegate John Steele relied\non the established \u201cmaxim of universal jurisprudence, of\nreason and common sense, that an instrument or deed of\nwriting shall be construed as to give validity to all parts\nof it, if it can be done without involving any absurdity\u201d in\nsupport of the argument that Article I, \u00a72\u2019s grant of voter\nqualifications to the States required a limited reading of\nArticle I, \u00a74. 4 Elliot\u2019s Debates 71.\n   This was no isolated view. See 2 id., at 50\u201351 (Massa-\nchusetts delegate Rufus King observing that \u201cthe power of\ncontrol given by [Article I, \u00a74,] extends to the manner of\nelection, not the qualifications of the electors\u201d); 4 id., at 61\n(same, North Carolina\u2019s William Davie); 3 id., at 202\u2013203\n(same, Virginia delegate Edmund Randolph); Roger Sher-\nman, A Citizen of New Haven: Observations on the New\nFederal Constitution, Connecticut Courant, Jan. 7, 1788,\nin 15 Documentary History 282 (J. Kaminski & G. Sala-\ndino eds. 1983) (same); A Freeman [Letter] II (Tench Coxe),\nPennsylvania Gazette, Jan. 30, 1788, in id., at 508 (same).\nIt was well understood that congressional power to regu-\nlate the \u201cManner\u201d of elections under Article I, \u00a74, did not\ninclude the power to override state voter qualifications\nunder Article I, \u00a72.\n                            3\n  The concern that gave rise to Article I, \u00a74, also supports\nthis limited reading. The Times, Places and Manner\nClause was designed to address the possibility that States\nmight refuse to hold any federal elections at all, eliminat-\ning Congress, and by extension the Federal Government.\nAs Hamilton explained, \u201cevery government ought to con-\ntain in itself the means of its own preservation.\u201d The\n12    ARIZONA v.

Reflecting this understanding\nof the reasoning behind Article I, \u00a74, many of the original\n13 States proposed constitutional amendments that would\nhave strictly cabined the Times, Places and Manner Clause\nto situations in which state failure to hold elections\nthreatened the continued existence of Congress.

Al-\nthough these amendments were never enacted, they un-\nderscore how narrowly the ratification conventions con-\nstrued Congress\u2019 power under the Times, Places and Man-\nner Clause. In contrast to a state refusal to hold federal\nelections at all, a state decision to alter the qualifica-\ntions of electors for state legislature (and thereby for\nfederal elections as well) does not threaten Congress\u2019 very\nexistence.\n                            C\n  Finding no support in the historical record, respondents\nand the United States instead chiefly assert that this\nCourt\u2019s precedents involving the Times, Places and Man-\nner Clause give Congress authority over voter qualifica-\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

But this\nCourt does not have the power to alter the terms of\nthe Constitution. Moreover, this Court\u2019s decisions do not\nsupport the respondents\u2019 and the Government\u2019s position.\n   Respondents and the United States point out that Smi-\nley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355 (1932), mentioned \u201cregistration\u201d\nin a list of voting-related subjects it believed Congress\ncould regulate under Article I, \u00a74. Id., at 366 (listing\n\u201cnotices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of\nvoters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting\nof votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making\nand publication of election returns\u201d (emphasis added)).\nSee Brief for ITCA Respondents 49; Brief for Gonzalez\nRespondents 48; Brief for United States 21. But that\nstatement was dicta because Smiley involved congres-\nsional redistricting, not voter registration. 285 U. S., at\n361\u2013362. Cases since Smiley have similarly not addressed\nthe issue of voter qualifications but merely repeated the\nword \u201cregistration\u201d without further analysis. See Cook v.\nGralike, 531 U. S. 510, 523 (2001); Roudebush v. Hartke,\n405 U. S. 15, 24 (1972).\n   Moreover, in Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970),\na majority of this Court, \u201ctook the position that [Article I,\n\u00a74,] did not confer upon Congress the power to regulate\nvoter qualifications in federal elections,\u201d as the majority\nrecognizes.

Most of the remaining\ncases cited by respondents and the Government merely\nconfirm that Congress\u2019 power to regulate the \u201cManner\nof holding Elections\u201d is limited to regulating events sur-\nrounding the when, where, and how of actually casting\nballots. See, e.g., United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299\n(1941) (upholding federal regulation of ballot fraud in\nprimary voting); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 (1884)\n(upholding federal penalties for intimidating voter in\ncongressional election); see also Foster v. Love, 522 U.

It is, thus, difficult to\nmaintain that the Times, Places and Manner Clause gives\nCongress power beyond regulating the casting of ballots\nand related activities, even as a matter of precedent.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 ArticleI, \u00a7\u00a72 and 4, and the Seventeenth Amendment concern con-\ngressional elections. The NVRA\u2019s \u201caccept and use\u201d requirement applies\nto all federal elections, even presidential elections. See \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(1). This Court has recognized, however, that \u201cthe state legisla-\nture\u2019s power to select the manner for appointing [presidential] electors\nis plenary; it may, if it chooses, select the electors itself.\u201d Bush v.

Legislatures in Florida in 1868 and\nColorado in 1876 chose delegates, id., at 822, and in recent memory, the\nFlorida Legislature in 2000 convened a special session to consider how\nto allocate its 25 electoral votes if the winner of the popular vote was\nnot determined in time for delegates to participate in the electoral\ncollege, see James, Election 2000: Florida Legislature Faces Own\nDisputes over Electors, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 2000, p.

Nor has it alleged that Congress\nlacks authority to direct the EAC to create the federal\nform. As a result, I need not address those issues. Ari-\nzona did, however, argue that respondent\u2019s interpretation\nof \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) would raise constitutional concerns. As\ndiscussed, supra, I too am concerned that respondent\u2019s\ninterpretation of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) would render the statute\nunconstitutional under Article I, \u00a72. Accordingly, I would\ninterpret \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) to avoid the constitutional prob-\nlems discussed above. See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S.\n678, 689 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is a cardinal principle\u2019 of statutory\ninterpretation, however, that when an Act of Congress\nraises \u2018a serious doubt\u2019 as to its constitutionality, \u2018this\nCourt will first ascertain whether a construction of the\nstatute is fairly possible by which the question may be\navoided\u2019 \u201d (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62\n(1932))).\n   I cannot, therefore, adopt the Court\u2019s interpretation that\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1)\u2019s \u201caccept and use\u201d provision requires\nstates to register anyone who completes and submits the\nform. Arizona sets citizenship as a qualification to vote,\nand it wishes to verify citizenship, as it is authorized to do\nunder Article 1, \u00a72. It matters not whether the United\nStates has specified one way in which it believes Arizona\nmight be able to verify citizenship; Arizona has the inde-\npendent constitutional authority to verify citizenship in\nthe way it deems necessary. See in Part II\u2013A\u20132, supra.\nBy requiring Arizona to register people who have not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nWithout Naming Electors, Wall Street Journal, Dec. 15, 2000, p. A6. \n\nConstitutional avoidance is especially appropriate in this area because \n\nthe NVRA purports to regulate presidential elections, an area over \n\nwhich the Constitution gives Congress no authority whatsoever. \n\n16    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\ndemonstrated to Arizona\u2019s satisfaction that they meet its\ncitizenship qualification for voting, the NVRA, as inter-\npreted by the Court, would exceed Congress\u2019 powers under\nArticle I, \u00a74, and violate Article 1, \u00a72.\n   Fortunately, Arizona\u2019s alternative interpretation of\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) avoids this problem. It is plausible that\nArizona \u201caccept[s] and use[s]\u201d the federal form under\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) so long as it receives the form and consid-\ners it as part of its voter application process. See post, at\n6\u201310 (ALITO, J., dissenting); 677 F. 3d, at 444 (Rawlinson,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); 624 F. 3d\n1162, 1205\u20131208 (CA9 2010) (Kozinski, C.

Given States\u2019 exclu-\nsive authority to set voter qualifications and to determine\nwhether those qualifications are met, I would hold that\nArizona may request whatever additional information it\nrequires to verify voter eligibility.\n                              B\n   The majority purports to avoid the difficult constitu-\ntional questions implicated by the Voter Qualifications\nClause. See ante, at 13\u201315. It nevertheless adopts re-\nspondents\u2019 reading of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) because it inter-\nprets Article I, \u00a72, as giving Arizona the right only to\n\u201cobtai[n] information necessary for enforcement\u201d of its\nvoting qualifications. Ante, at 15. The majority posits\nthat Arizona may pursue relief by making an administra-\ntive request to the EAC that, if denied, could be challenged\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Ante,\nat 15\u201317.\n   JUSTICE ALITO is correct to point out that the majority\u2019s\nreliance on the EAC is meaningless because the EAC\nhas no members and no current prospects of new mem-\nbers.

I would not require\nArizona to seek approval for its registration requirements\nfrom the Federal Government, for, as I have shown, the\nFederal Government does not have the constitutional\nauthority to withhold such approval. Accordingly, it does\nnot have the authority to command States to seek it. As\na result, the majority\u2019s proposed solution does little to\navoid the serious constitutional problems created by its\ninterpretation.\n                          *    *   *\n   Instead of adopting respondents\u2019 definition of \u201caccept\nand use\u201d and offering Arizona the dubious recourse of\nbringing an APA challenge within the NVRA framework,\nI would adopt an interpretation of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) that\navoids the constitutional problems with respondents\u2019 in-\nterpretation. The States, not the Federal Government,\nhave the exclusive right to define the \u201cQualifications\nrequisite for Electors,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 1, which\nincludes the corresponding power to verify that those\nqualifications have been met. I would, therefore, hold that\nArizona may \u201creject any application for registration that is\nnot accompanied by satisfactory evidence of United States\ncitizenship,\u201d as defined by Arizona law.

See Art. I, \u00a72, cl. 1\n(House); Amdt. 17 (Senate). The States also have the\ndefault authority to regulate federal voter registration.\nSee Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1. Exercising its right to set federal voter\nqualifications, Arizona, like every other State, permits\nonly U. S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and Arizona\nhas concluded that this requirement cannot be effectively\nenforced unless applicants for registration are required to\nprovide proof of citizenship. According to the Court, how-\never, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)\ndeprives Arizona of this authority. I do not think that this\nis what Congress intended.\n   I also doubt that Congress meant for the success of\nan application for voter registration to depend on which of\ntwo valid but substantially different registration forms the\napplicant happens to fill out and submit, but that is how\nthe Court reads the NVRA. The Court interprets one\nprovision, 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), to mean that, if\nan applicant fills out the federal form, a State must regis-\n2     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nter the applicant without requiring proof of citizenship.\nBut the Court does not question Arizona\u2019s authority under\nanother provision of the NVRA, \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2), to create\nits own application form that demands proof of citizen-\nship; nor does the Court dispute Arizona\u2019s right to refuse\nto register an applicant who submits that form without the\nrequisite proof. I find it very hard to believe that this is\nwhat Congress had in mind.\n   These results are not required by the NVRA. Proper\nrespect for the constitutional authority of the States de-\nmands a clear indication of a congressional intent to pre-\nempt state laws enforcing voter qualifications. And while\nthe relevant provisions of the Act are hardly models of\nclarity, their best reading is that the States need not\ntreat the federal form as a complete voter registration\napplication.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   In light of the States\u2019 authority under the Elections\nClause of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1, I would begin\nby applying a presumption against pre-emption of the\nArizona law requiring voter registration applicants to\nsubmit proof of citizenship. Under the Elections Clause,\nthe States have the authority to specify the times, places,\nand manner of federal elections except to the extent that\nCongress chooses to provide otherwise. And in recognition\nof this allocation of authority, it is appropriate to presume\nthat the States retain this authority unless Congress has\nclearly manifested a contrary intent. The Court states\nthat \u201c[w]e have never mentioned [the presumption against\npre-emption] in our Elections Clause cases,\u201d ante, at 10,\nbut in United States v. Gradwell, 243 U. S. 476 (1917), we\nread a federal statute narrowly out of deference to the\nStates\u2019 traditional authority in this area. In doing so, we\nexplained that \u201cthe policy of Congress for [a] great . . . part\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nof our constitutional life has been . . . to leave the conduct\nof the election of its members to state laws, administered\nby state officers, and that whenever it has assumed to\nregulate such elections it has done so by positive and clear\nstatutes.\u201d Id., at 485 (emphasis added).1 The presumption\nagainst pre-emption applies with full force when Congress\nlegislates in a \u201cfield which the States have traditionally\noccupied,\u201d Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,\n230 (1947), and the NVRA was the first significant federal\nregulation of voter registration enacted under the Elec-\ntions Clause since Reconstruction.\n   The Court has it exactly backwards when it declines to\napply the presumption against pre-emption because \u201cthe\nfederalism concerns underlying the presumption in the Su-\npremacy Clause context are somewhat weaker\u201d in an Elec-\ntions Clause case like this one. Ante, at 12. To the\ncontrary, Arizona has a \u201c \u2018compelling interest in preserving\nthe integrity of its election process\u2019 \u201d that the Constitution\nrecognizes and that the Court\u2019s reading of the Act seri-\nously undermines. Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1, 4 (2006)\n(per curiam) (quoting Eu v. San Francisco County Demo-\ncratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 231 (1989)).\n   By reserving to the States default responsibility for\nadministering federal elections, the Elections Clause\nprotects several critical values that the Court disregards.\nFirst, as Madison explained in defense of the Elections\nClause at the Virginia Convention, \u201c[i]t was found neces-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court argues that Gradwell is irrelevant, observing that there\n\nwas no state law directly at issue in that case, which concerned a pros-\necution under a federal statute. Ante, at 10, n. 5. But the same is\ntrue of Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371 (1880), on which the Court relies\nin the very next breath. In any event, it is hard to see why a presump-\ntion about the effect of federal law on the conduct of congressional\nelections should have less force when the federal law is alleged to\nconflict with a state law. If anything, one would expect the opposite\nto be true.\n4     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nsary to leave the regulation of [federal elections], in the\nfirst place, to the state governments, as being best ac-\nquainted with the situation of the people.\u201d 3 Records of\nthe Federal Convention of 1787, p. 312 (M. Farrand ed.\n1911). Because the States are closer to the people, the\nFramers thought that state regulation of federal elections\nwould \u201cin ordinary cases . . . be both more convenient and\nmore satisfactory.\u201d The Federalist No. 59, p. 360 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).\n   Second, as we have previously observed, the integrity of\nfederal elections is a subject over which the States and the\nFederal Government \u201care mutually concerned.\u201d Ex parte\nSiebold, 100 U. S. 371, 391 (1880). By giving States a role\nin the administration of federal elections, the Elections\nClause reflects the States\u2019 interest in the selection of the\nindividuals on whom they must rely to represent their\ninterests in the National Legislature. See U. S. Term\nLimits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 858\u2013859 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   Third, the Elections Clause\u2019s default rule helps to pro-\ntect the States\u2019 authority to regulate state and local elec-\ntions. As a practical matter, it would be very burdensome\nfor a State to maintain separate federal and state registra-\ntion processes with separate federal and state voter rolls.\nFor that reason, any federal regulation in this area is\nlikely to displace not only state control of federal elections\nbut also state control of state and local elections.\n   Needless to say, when Congress believes that some\noverriding national interest justifies federal regulation, it\nhas the power to \u201cmake or alter\u201d state laws specifying the\n\u201cTimes, Places and Manner\u201d of federal elections. Art. I,\n\u00a74, cl. 1. But we should expect Congress to speak clearly\nwhen it decides to displace a default rule enshrined in\nthe text of the Constitution that serves such important\npurposes.\n   The Court answers that when Congress exercises its\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\npower under the Elections Clause \u201cit necessarily displaces\nsome element of a pre-existing legal regime erected by the\nStates.\u201d Ante, at 11. But the same is true whenever\nCongress legislates in an area of concurrent state and fed-\neral power. A federal law regulating the operation of\ngrain warehouses, for example, necessarily alters the\n\u201cpre-existing legal regime erected by the States,\u201d see Rice,\nsupra, at 229\u2013230\u2014even if only by regulating an activity\nthe States had chosen not to constrain.2 In light of Ari-\nzona\u2019s constitutionally codified interest in the integrity of\nits federal elections, \u201cit is incumbent upon the federal courts\nto be certain\u201d that Congress intended to pre-empt Ari-\nzona\u2019s law. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S.\n234, 243 (1985).\n                           B\n   The canon of constitutional avoidance also counsels\nagainst the Court\u2019s reading of the Act. As the Court\nacknowledges, the Constitution reserves for the States the\npower to decide who is qualified to vote in federal elec-\ntions. Ante, at 13\u201315; see Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.\n112, 210\u2013211 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). The Court also recognizes that, al-\nthough Congress generally has the authority to regulate\nthe \u201cTimes, Places and Manner of holding\u201d such elections,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The Court observes that the Commerce Clause, unlike the Elections\n\nClause, empowers Congress to legislate in areas that do not implicate\nconcurrent state power. Ante, at 12, n. 6. Apparently the Court means\nthat the presumption against pre-emption only applies in those unus-\nual cases in which it is unclear whether a federal statute even touches on\nsubject matter that the States may regulate under their broad police\npowers. I doubt that the Court is prepared to abide by this cramped\nunderstanding of the presumption against pre-emption. See, e.g.,\nHillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (\u201cThere is\ntherefore \u2018a presumption against pre-emption\u2019 of state laws governing\ndomestic relations\u201d (quoting Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 151\n(2001)).\n6      ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nArt. I, \u00a74, cl. 1, a federal law that frustrates a State\u2019s\nability to enforce its voter qualifications would be constitu-\ntionally suspect. Ante, at 15; see ante, at 4\u20138 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting). The Court nevertheless reads the NVRA to\nrestrict Arizona\u2019s ability to enforce its law providing that\nonly United States citizens may vote. See Ariz. Const.,\nArt. VII, \u00a72. We are normally more reluctant to inter-\npret federal statutes as upsetting \u201cthe usual constitutional\nbalance of federal and state powers.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft,\n501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991); see Frankfurter, Some Reflec-\ntions on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527,\n540 (1947) (\u201c[W]hen the Federal Government . . . radically\nreadjusts the balance of state and national authority,\nthose charged with the duty of legislating are reasonably\nexplicit\u201d).\n   In refusing to give any weight to Arizona\u2019s interest in\nenforcing its voter qualifications, the Court suggests that\nthe State could return to the Election Assistance Com-\nmission and renew its request for a change to the federal\nform. Ante, at 16\u201317. But that prospect does little to\nassuage constitutional concerns. The EAC currently has\nno members, and there is no reason to believe that it will\nbe restored to life in the near future. If that situation\npersists, Arizona\u2019s ability to obtain a judicial resolution of\nits constitutional claim is problematic. The most that the\nCourt is prepared to say is that the State \u201cmight\u201d succeed\nby seeking a writ of mandamus, and failing that, \u201cmight\u201d\nbe able to mount a constitutional challenge. Ante, at 17,\nn. 10. The Court sends the State to traverse a veritable\nprocedural obstacle course in the hope of obtaining a\njudicial decision on the constitutionality of the relevant\nprovisions of the NVRA. A sensible interpretation of the\nAct would obviate these difficulties.\n                          II\n    The NVRA does not come close to manifesting the clear\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nintent to pre-empt that we should expect to find when\nCongress has exercised its Elections Clause power in a\nway that is constitutionally questionable. Indeed, even if\nneither the presumption against pre-emption nor the\ncanon of constitutional avoidance applied, the better read-\ning of the Act would be that Arizona is free to require\nthose who use the federal form to supplement their appli-\ncations with proof of citizenship.\n  I agree with the Court that the phrase \u201caccept and use,\u201d\nwhen read in isolation, is ambiguous, ante, at 6\u20137, but\nI disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a71973gg\u2013\n4(a)(1)\u2019s use of that phrase means that a State must treat\nthe federal form as a complete application and must either\ngrant or deny registration without requiring that the ap-\nplicant supply additional information. Instead, I would\nhold that a State \u201caccept[s] and use[s]\u201d the federal form so\nlong as it uses the form as a meaningful part of the regis-\ntration process.\n  The Court begins its analysis of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1)\u2019s con-\ntext by examining unrelated uses of the word \u201caccept\u201d\nelsewhere in the United States Code. Ante, at 7\u20138. But a\nbetter place to start is to ask what it normally means to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d an application form. When the phrase is\nused in that context, it is clear that an organization can\n\u201caccept and use\u201d a form that it does not treat as a complete\napplication. For example, many colleges and universities\naccept and use the Common Application for Undergradu-\nate College Admission but also require that applicants\nsubmit various additional forms or documents. See Com-\nmon Application, 2012\u20132013 College Deadlines, Fees, and\nRequirements, https://www.commonapp.org/CommonApp/\nMemberRequirements.aspx (all Internet materials as\nvisited June 10, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). Similarly, the Social Security Administration\nundoubtedly \u201caccepts and uses\u201d its Social Security card\napplication form even though someone applying for a card\n8     ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nmust also prove that he or she is a citizen or has a qualify-\ning immigration status. See Application for a Social Secu-\nrity Card, Form SS\u20135 (2011), http://www.socialsecurity.gov/\nonline/ss-5.pdf. As such examples illustrate, when an\norganization says that it \u201caccepts and uses\u201d an application\nform, it does not necessarily mean that the form consti-\ntutes a complete application.\n   That is not to say that the phrase \u201caccept and use\u201d is\nmeaningless when issued as a \u201cgovernment diktat\u201d in\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1). Ante, at 7. Arizona could not be said to\n\u201caccept and use\u201d the federal form if it required applicants\nwho submit that form to provide all the same information\na second time on a separate state form. But Arizona does\nnothing of the kind. To the contrary, the entire basis for\nrespondents\u2019 suit is that Proposition 200 mandates that\napplicants provide information that does not appear on a\ncompleted federal form. Although \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) forbids\nStates from requiring applicants who use the federal\nform to submit a duplicative state form, nothing in that pro-\nvision\u2019s text prevents Arizona from insisting that federal\nform applicants supplement their applications with addi-\ntional information.\n   That understanding of \u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(1) is confirmed by\n\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2), which allows States to design and use\ntheir own voter registration forms \u201c[i]n addition to accept-\ning and using\u201d the federal form. The Act clearly permits\nStates to require proof of citizenship on their own forms,\nsee \u00a7\u00a71973gg\u20134(a)(2) and 1973gg\u20137(b)\u2014a step that Ari-\nzona has taken and that today\u2019s decision does not disturb.\nThus, under the Court\u2019s approach, whether someone can\nregister to vote in Arizona without providing proof of\ncitizenship will depend on the happenstance of which of\ntwo alternative forms the applicant completes. That could\nnot possibly be what Congress intended; it is as if the\nInternal Revenue Service issued two sets of personal\nincome tax forms with different tax rates.\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   9\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   We could avoid this nonsensical result by holding that\nthe Act lets the States decide for themselves what in-\nformation \u201cis necessary . . . to assess the eligibility of the\napplicant\u201d\u2014both by designing their own forms and by\nrequiring that federal form applicants provide supple-\nmental information when appropriate. \u00a71973gg\u20137(b)(1).\nThe Act\u2019s provision for state forms shows that the purpose\nof the federal form is not to supplant the States\u2019 authority\nin this area but to facilitate interstate voter registration\ndrives. Thanks to the federal form, volunteers distrib-\nuting voter registration materials at a shopping mall in\nYuma can give a copy of the same form to every person\nthey meet without attempting to distinguish between\nresidents of Arizona and California. See H. R. Rep. No.\n103\u20139, p. 10 (1993) (\u201cUniform mail forms will permit voter\nregistration drives through a regional or national mailing,\nor for more than one State at a central location, such as a\ncity where persons from a number of neighboring States\nwork, shop or attend events\u201d). The federal form was\nmeant to facilitate voter registration drives, not to take\naway the States\u2019 traditional authority to decide what\ninformation registrants must supply.3\n   The Court purports to find support for its contrary\napproach in \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B), which says that a State\nmust \u201censure that any eligible applicant is registered to\nvote in an election . . . if the valid voter registration form\nof the applicant is postmarked\u201d within a specified period.\nAnte, at 8\u20139. The Court understands \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B)\nto mean that a State must register an eligible applicant if\nhe or she submits a \u201c \u2018valid voter registration form.\u2019 \u201d Ante,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The Court argues that the federal form would not accomplish this\n\npurpose under my interpretation because \u201ca volunteer in Yuma would\nhave to give every prospective voter not only a Federal Form, but also\na separate set of either Arizona- or California-specific instructions.\u201d\nAnte, at 10, n. 4. But this is exactly what Congress envisioned. Eigh-\nteen of the federal form\u2019s 23 pages are state-specific instructions.\n10    ARIZONA v. INTER TRIBAL COUNCIL OF ARIZ. INC.\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nat 9. But when read in context, that provision simply\nidentifies the time within which a State must process\nregistration applications; it says nothing about whether\na State may require the submission of supplemental in-\nformation. The Court\u2019s more expansive interpretation of\n\u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) sneaks in a qualification that is no-\nwhere to be found in the text. The Court takes pains to\nsay that a State need not register an applicant who\nproperly completes and submits a federal form but is\nknown by the State to be ineligible. See ante, at 12\u201313.\nBut the Court takes the position that a State may not\ndemand that an applicant supply any additional infor-\nmation to confirm voting eligibility. Nothing in \u00a71973gg\u2013\n6(a)(1)(B) supports this distinction.\n   What is a State to do if it has reason to doubt an appli-\ncant\u2019s eligibility but cannot be sure that the applicant is\nineligible? Must the State either grant or deny registra-\ntion without communicating with the applicant? Or does\nthe Court believe that a State may ask for additional\ninformation in individual cases but may not impose a\ncategorical requirement for all applicants? If that is the\nCourt\u2019s position, on which provision of the NVRA does it\nrely? The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71973gg\u20136(a)(1)(B) is atex-\ntual and makes little sense.\n                          *     *     *\n  Properly interpreted, the NVRA permits Arizona to\nrequire applicants for federal voter registration to provide\nproof of eligibility. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
