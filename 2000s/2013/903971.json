UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11\u20139540. Argued January 7, 2013\u2014Decided June 20, 2013\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) increases the sentences of cer-\n  tain federal defendants who have three prior convictions \u201cfor a vio-\n  lent felony,\u201d including \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7924(e). To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those\n  crimes, courts use a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d: They compare the statu-\n  tory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d\n  crime\u2015i.e., the offense as commonly understood. If the statute\u2019s ele-\n  ments are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense,\n  the prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. When a prior\n  conviction is for violating a \u201cdivisible statute\u201d\u2014one that sets out one\n  or more of the elements in the alternative, e.g., burglary involving en-\n  try into a building or an automobile\u2014a \u201cmodified categorical ap-\n  proach\u201d is used. That approach permits sentencing courts to consult\n  a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instruc-\n  tions, to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the\n  defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\n     Petitioner Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of\n  a firearm. The Government sought an ACCA sentence enhancement,\n  pointing to Descamps\u2019 three prior convictions, including one for bur-\n  glary under California Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459, which provides that a\n  \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations \u201cwith intent to commit grand or\n  petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d In imposing an en-\n  hanced sentence, the District Court rejected Descamps\u2019 argument\n  that his \u00a7459 conviction cannot serve as an ACCA predicate because\n  \u00a7459 goes beyond the \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary. The Ninth Cir-\n  cuit affirmed, holding that its decision in United States v. Aguila-\n  Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915, permits the application of the modified\n  categorical approach to a prior conviction under a statute that is\n2                   DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    \u201ccategorically broader than the generic offense.\u201d It found that\n    Descamps\u2019 \u00a7459 conviction, as revealed in the plea colloquy, rested on\n    facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary.\nHeld: The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes like\n \u00a7459 that contain a single, indivisible set of elements. Pp. 5\u221223.\n    (a) This Court\u2019s caselaw all but resolves this case. In Taylor v.\n United States, 495 U. S. 575, and Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S.\n 13, the Court approved the use of a modified categorical approach in\n a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d in which a divisible statute, listing poten-\n tial offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which ele-\n ment played a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction. Because a sentenc-\n ing court cannot tell, simply by looking at a divisible statute, which\n version of the offense a defendant was convicted of, the court is per-\n mitted to consult extra-statutory documents\u2014but only to assess\n whether the defendant was convicted of the particular \u201cstatutory def-\n inition\u201d that corresponds to the generic offense. Nijhawan v. Holder,\n 557 U. S. 29, and Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, also em-\n phasized this elements-based rationale for the modified categorical\n approach. That approach plays no role here, where the dispute does\n not concern alternative elements but a simple discrepancy between\n generic burglary and \u00a7459. Pp. 5\u221210.\n    (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s Aguila-Montes approach turns an elements-\n based inquiry into an evidence-based one, asking not whether \u201cstatu-\n tory definitions\u201d necessarily require an adjudicator to find the generic\n offense, but whether the prosecutor\u2019s case realistically led the adjudi-\n cator to find certain facts. Aguila-Montes has no roots in this Court\u2019s\n precedents. In fact, it subverts those decisions, conflicting with each\n of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening\n to undo all its benefits. Pp. 10\u201319.\n      (1) Taylor\u2019s elements-centric categorical approach comports with\n ACCA\u2019s text and history, avoids Sixth Amendment concerns that\n would arise from sentencing courts\u2019 making factual findings that\n properly belong to juries, and averts \u201cthe practical difficulties and po-\n tential unfairness of a factual approach.\u201d 495 U. S., at 601.\n    ACCA\u2019s language shows that Congress intended sentencing courts\n \u201cto look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of\n crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underly-\n ing the prior convictions.\u201d Id., at 600. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach\n runs headlong into that congressional choice. Instead of reviewing\n extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative ele-\n ment was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those ma-\n terials to discover what the defendant actually did.\n    Under ACCA, the sentencing court\u2019s finding of a predicate offense\n indisputably increases the maximum penalty. Accordingly, that find-\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ing would (at least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it\n  went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. That is why\n  Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed de-\n  termination about what facts must have supported a defendant\u2019s\n  conviction. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion). Yet the Ninth Circuit\n  flouts this Court\u2019s reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that\n  goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.\n     The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision also creates the same \u201cdaunting\u201d diffi-\n  culties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the cate-\n  gorical approach. Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would\n  have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evi-\n  dence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that,\n  although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element\n  of the relevant generic offense. And the Aguila-Montes approach\n  would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiat-\n  ed plea deals. Pp. 12\u201316.\n        (2) In defending Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit denied any\n  real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending\n  further than the generic offense. But the Circuit\u2019s efforts to imagina-\n  tively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavail-\n  ing. Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude\n  that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of\n  every element of the generic crime. Pp. 16\u221219.\n     (c) The Government offers a slightly different argument: It con-\n  tends that the modified categorical approach should apply where, as\n  here, the mismatch of elements between the crime of conviction and\n  the generic offense results not from a missing element but from an\n  element\u2019s overbreadth. But that distinction is malleable and manipu-\n  lable. And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.\n  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing ele-\n  ment, the problem is the same: Because of the mismatch in ele-\n  ments, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the\n  generic crime. Pp. 19\u221222.\n     (d) Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alter-\n  native element of, \u00a7459, a conviction under that statute is never for\n  generic burglary. Descamps\u2019 ACCA enhancement was therefore im-\n  proper. Pp. 22\u201323.\n466 Fed. Appx. 563, reversed.\n\n   KAGAN, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C. \u00a7924(e), increases the sentences of certain federal\ndefendants who have three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent\nfelony,\u201d including \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion.\u201d To de-\ntermine whether a past conviction is for one of those\ncrimes, courts use what has become known as the \u201ccate-\ngorical approach\u201d: They compare the elements of the stat-\nute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction with\nthe elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d crime\u2014i.e., the offense as\ncommonly understood. The prior conviction qualifies as\nan ACCA predicate only if the statute\u2019s elements are the\nsame as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.\n   We have previously approved a variant of this method\u2014\nlabeled (not very inventively) the \u201cmodified categorical\napproach\u201d\u2014when a prior conviction is for violating a so-\ncalled \u201cdivisible statute.\u201d That kind of statute sets out one\nor more elements of the offense in the alternative\u2014for\nexample, stating that burglary involves entry into a build-\ning or an automobile. If one alternative (say, a building)\nmatches an element in the generic offense, but the other\n2               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(say, an automobile) does not, the modified categorical\napproach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited\nclass of documents, such as indictments and jury instruc-\ntions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of\nthe defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The court can then do\nwhat the categorical approach demands: compare the\nelements of the crime of conviction (including the alterna-\ntive element used in the case) with the elements of the\ngeneric crime.\n   This case presents the question whether sentencing\ncourts may also consult those additional documents when\na defendant was convicted under an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute\u2014\ni.e., one not containing alternative elements\u2014that crimi-\nnalizes a broader swath of conduct than the relevant\ngeneric offense. That would enable a court to decide,\nbased on information about a case\u2019s underlying facts, that\nthe defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA\npredicate even though the elements of the crime fail to\nsatisfy our categorical test. Because that result would\ncontravene our prior decisions and the principles underly-\ning them, we hold that sentencing courts may not apply\nthe modified categorical approach when the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of\nelements.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Michael Descamps was convicted of being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a7922(g). That unadorned offense carries a maximum\npenalty of 10 years in prison. The Government, however,\nsought an enhanced sentence under ACCA, based on\nDescamps\u2019 prior state convictions for burglary, robbery,\nand felony harassment.\n   ACCA prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15\nyears for a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and \u201chas three\nprevious convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndrug offense.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(1). The Act defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nto mean any felony, whether state or federal, that \u201chas\nas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person of another,\u201d or that \u201cis\nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten-\ntial risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   Descamps argued that his prior burglary conviction\ncould not count as an ACCA predicate offense under our\ncategorical approach. He had pleaded guilty to violating\nCalifornia Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West 2010), which pro-\nvides that a \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations \u201cwith\nintent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is\nguilty of burglary.\u201d That statute does not require the\nentry to have been unlawful in the way most burglary\nlaws do. Whereas burglary statutes generally demand\nbreaking and entering or similar conduct, California\u2019s does\nnot: It covers, for example, a shoplifter who enters a store,\nlike any customer, during normal business hours. See\nPeople v. Barry, 94 Cal. 481, 483\u2013484, 29 P. 1026, 1026\u2013\n1027 (1892). In sweeping so widely, the state law goes\nbeyond the normal, \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary. Ac-\ncording to Descamps, that asymmetry of offense elements\nprecluded his conviction under \u00a7459 from serving as an\nACCA predicate, whether or not his own burglary involved\nan unlawful entry that could have satisfied the require-\nments of the generic crime.\n   The District Court disagreed. According to the court,\nour modified categorical approach permitted it to examine\ncertain documents, including the record of the plea collo-\nquy, to discover whether Descamps had \u201cadmitted the\nelements of a generic burglary\u201d when entering his plea.\nApp. 50a. And that transcript, the court ruled, showed\nthat Descamps had done so. At the plea hearing, the\nprosecutor proffered that the crime \u201c \u2018 involve[d] the break-\ning and entering of a grocery store,\u2019 \u201d and Descamps failed\n4                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto object to that statement. Ibid. The plea proceed-\nings, the District Court thought, thus established that\nDescamps\u2019 prior conviction qualified as a generic burglary\n(and so as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d) under ACCA. Applying the\nrequisite penalty enhancement, the court sentenced\nDescamps to 262 months in prison\u2014more than twice the\nterm he would otherwise have received.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed,\nrelying on its recently issued decision in United States v.\nAguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915 (2011) (en banc) (per\ncuriam). There, a divided en banc court took much the\nsame view of the modified categorical approach as had\nthe District Court in this case. The en banc court held\nthat when a sentencing court considers a conviction under\n\u00a7459\u2014or any other statute that is \u201ccategorically broader\nthan the generic offense\u201d\u2014the court may scrutinize cer-\ntain documents to determine the factual basis of the con-\nviction. See id., at 940. Applying that approach, the\nCourt of Appeals here found that Descamps\u2019 plea, as re-\nvealed in the colloquy, \u201crested on facts that satisfy the\nelements of the generic definition of burglary.\u201d 466 Fed.\nAppx. 563, 565 (2012).\n  We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nCircuit split on whether the modified categorical approach\napplies to statutes like \u00a7459 that contain a single, \u201cindi-\nvisible\u201d set of elements sweeping more broadly than the\ncorresponding generic offense.1 We hold that it does not,\nand so reverse.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Compare, e.g., 466 Fed.

Beardsley,\n691 F. 3d 252, 268\u2013274 (CA2 2012) (holding that the modified categori-\ncal approach applies only to divisible statutes); United States v.

In those\ndecisions, as shown below, the modified approach serves a\nlimited function: It helps effectuate the categorical analy-\nsis when a divisible statute, listing potential offense ele-\nments in the alternative, renders opaque which element\nplayed a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction. So under-\nstood, the modified approach cannot convert Descamps\u2019\nconviction under \u00a7459 into an ACCA predicate, because\nthat state law defines burglary not alternatively, but only\nmore broadly than the generic offense.\n   We begin with Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575\n(1990), which established the rule for determining when\na defendant\u2019s prior conviction counts as one of ACCA\u2019s\nenumerated predicate offenses (e.g., burglary). Taylor\nadopted a \u201cformal categorical approach\u201d: Sentencing\ncourts may \u201clook only to the statutory definitions\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe elements\u2014of a defendant\u2019s prior offenses, and not \u201cto\nthe particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d Id., at\n600. If the relevant statute has the same elements as the\n\u201cgeneric\u201d ACCA crime, then the prior conviction can serve\nas an ACCA predicate; so too if the statute defines the\ncrime more narrowly, because anyone convicted under\nthat law is \u201cnecessarily . . . guilty of all the [generic\ncrime\u2019s] elements.\u201d Id., at 599. But if the statute sweeps\nmore broadly than the generic crime, a conviction under\nthat law cannot count as an ACCA predicate, even if the\ndefendant actually committed the offense in its generic\nform. The key, we emphasized, is elements, not facts. So,\nfor example, we held that a defendant can receive an\nACCA enhancement for burglary only if he was convicted\nof a crime having \u201cthe basic elements\u201d of generic burglary\u2014\ni.e., \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining\nin, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d\nIbid. And indeed, we indicated that the very statute at\n6               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissue here, \u00a7459, does not fit that bill because \u201cCalifornia\ndefines \u2018burglary\u2019 so broadly as to include shoplifting.\u201d Id.,\nat 591.\n  At the same time, Taylor recognized a \u201cnarrow range of\ncases\u201d in which sentencing courts\u2014applying what we\nwould later dub the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d\u2014may\nlook beyond the statutory elements to \u201cthe charging paper\nand jury instructions\u201d used in a case. Id., at 602. To\nexplain when courts should resort to that approach, we\nhypothesized a statute with alternative elements\u2014more\nparticularly, a burglary statute (otherwise conforming to\nthe generic crime) that prohibits \u201centry of an automobile\nas well as a building.\u201d Ibid. One of those alternatives (a\nbuilding) corresponds to an element in generic burglary,\nwhereas the other (an automobile) does not. In a typical\ncase brought under the statute, the prosecutor charges one\nof those two alternatives, and the judge instructs the jury\naccordingly. So if the case involves entry into a building,\nthe jury is \u201cactually required to find all the elements of\ngeneric burglary,\u201d as the categorical approach demands.\nIbid. But the statute alone does not disclose whether\nthat has occurred. Because the statute is \u201cdivisible\u201d\u2014i.e.,\ncomprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime\u2014a\nlater sentencing court cannot tell, without reviewing\nsomething more, if the defendant\u2019s conviction was for the\ngeneric (building) or non-generic (automobile) form of\nburglary. Hence Taylor permitted sentencing courts, as a\ntool for implementing the categorical approach, to examine\na limited class of documents to determine which of a stat-\nute\u2019s alternative elements formed the basis of the defend-\nant\u2019s prior conviction.\n  In Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005), the\nhypothetical we posited in Taylor became real: We con-\nfronted a Massachusetts burglary statute covering entries\ninto \u201cboats and cars\u201d as well as buildings. 544 U.

S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nute, and we first confirmed that Taylor\u2019s categorical ap-\nproach applies not just to jury verdicts, but also to plea\nagreements. That meant, we held, that a conviction based\non a guilty plea can qualify as an ACCA predicate only if\nthe defendant \u201cnecessarily admitted [the] elements of the\ngeneric offense.\u201d Id., at 26. But as we had anticipated in\nTaylor, the divisible nature of the Massachusetts burglary\nstatute confounded that inquiry: No one could know, just\nfrom looking at the statute, which version of the offense\nShepard was convicted of. Accordingly, we again author-\nized sentencing courts to scrutinize a restricted set of\nmaterials\u2014here, \u201cthe terms of a plea agreement or tran-\nscript of colloquy between judge and defendant\u201d\u2014to de-\ntermine if the defendant had pleaded guilty to entering a\nbuilding or, alternatively, a car or boat. Ibid. Yet we\nagain underscored the narrow scope of that review: It was\nnot to determine \u201cwhat the defendant and state judge\nmust have understood as the factual basis of the prior\nplea,\u201d but only to assess whether the plea was to the ver-\nsion of the crime in the Massachusetts statute (burglary of\na building) corresponding to the generic offense. Id., at\n25\u201326 (plurality opinion).\n  Two more recent decisions have further emphasized\nthe elements-based rationale\u2014applicable only to divisible\nstatutes\u2014for examining documents like an indictment or\nplea agreement. In Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29\n(2009), we discussed another Massachusetts statute, this\none prohibiting \u201c \u2018Breaking and Entering at Night\u2019 \u201d in any\nof four alternative places: a \u201cbuilding, ship, vessel, or\nvehicle.\u201d Id., at 35. We recognized that when a statute so\n\u201crefer[s] to several different crimes,\u201d not all of which qualify\nas an ACCA predicate, a court must determine which\ncrime formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Ibid.\nThat is why, we explained, Taylor and Shepard developed\nthe modified categorical approach. By reviewing the\nextra-statutory materials approved in those cases, courts\n8                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncould discover \u201cwhich statutory phrase,\u201d contained within\na statute listing \u201cseveral different\u201d crimes, \u201ccovered a prior\nconviction.\u201d 557 U. S., at 41. And a year later, we repeated\nthat understanding of when and why courts can resort\nto those documents: \u201c[T]he \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019\nthat we have approved permits a court to determine which\nstatutory phrase was the basis for the conviction.\u201d John-\nson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144 (2010) (citation\nomitted).\n   Applied in that way\u2014which is the only way we have\never allowed\u2014the modified approach merely helps im-\nplement the categorical approach when a defendant was\nconvicted of violating a divisible statute. The modified\napproach thus acts not as an exception, but instead as a\ntool. It retains the categorical approach\u2019s central feature:\na focus on the elements, rather than the facts, of a crime.\nAnd it preserves the categorical approach\u2019s basic method:\ncomparing those elements with the generic offense\u2019s. All\nthe modified approach adds is a mechanism for making\nthat comparison when a statute lists multiple, alternative\nelements, and so effectively creates \u201cseveral different . . .\ncrimes.\u201d Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41. If at least one, but\nnot all of those crimes matches the generic version, a court\nneeds a way to find out which the defendant was convicted\nof. That is the job, as we have always understood it, of the\nmodified approach: to identify, from among several alter-\nnatives, the crime of conviction so that the court can com-\npare it to the generic offense.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thedissent delves into the nuances of various States\u2019 laws in an\neffort to cast doubt on this understanding of our prior holdings, arguing\nthat we used the modified categorical approach in cases like Taylor,\nShepard, and Johnson \u201cin relation to statutes that may not have been\ndivisible\u201d in the way that we have just described. Post, at 5 (ALITO, J.).\nBut if, as the dissent claims, the state laws at issue in those cases set\nout \u201cmerely alternative means, not alternative elements\u201d of an offense,\npost, at 7, that is news to us. And more important, it would have been\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The modified approach thus has no role to play in this\ncase. The dispute here does not concern any list of alter-\nnative elements. Rather, it involves a simple discrepancy\nbetween generic burglary and the crime established in\n\u00a7459. The former requires an unlawful entry along the\nlines of breaking and entering. See 3 W. LaFave, Sub-\nstantive Criminal Law \u00a721.1(a) (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter\nLaFave). The latter does not, and indeed covers simple\nshoplifting, as even the Government acknowledges. See\nBrief for United States 38; Barry, 94 Cal., at 483\u2013484, 29\nP., at 1026\u20131027. In Taylor\u2019s words, then, \u00a7459 \u201cdefine[s]\nburglary more broadly\u201d than the generic offense. 495\nU. S., at 599. And because that is true\u2014because Califor-\nnia, to get a conviction, need not prove that Descamps\nbroke and entered\u2014a \u00a7459 violation cannot serve as an\nACCA predicate. Whether Descamps did break and enter\nmakes no difference. And likewise, whether he ever ad-\nmitted to breaking and entering is irrelevant. Our deci-\nsions authorize review of the plea colloquy or other\napproved extra-statutory documents only when a statute\ndefines burglary not (as here) overbroadly, but instead\nalternatively, with one statutory phrase corresponding to\nthe generic crime and another not. In that circumstance,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnews to the Taylor, Shepard, and Johnson Courts: All those decisions\nrested on the explicit premise that the laws \u201ccontain[ed] statutory\nphrases that cover several different . . . crimes,\u201d not several different\nmethods of committing one offense. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144 (citing\nNijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41). And if the dissent\u2019s real point is that\ndistinguishing between \u201calternative elements\u201d and \u201calternative means\u201d\nis difficult, we can see no real-world reason to worry. Whatever a\nstatute lists (whether elements or means), the documents we approved\nin Taylor and Shepard\u2014i.e., indictment, jury instructions, plea collo-\nquy, and plea agreement\u2014would reflect the crime\u2019s elements. So a\ncourt need not parse state law in the way the dissent suggests: When a\nstate law is drafted in the alternative, the court merely resorts to the\napproved documents and compares the elements revealed there to those\nof the generic offense.\n10                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\na court may look to the additional documents to determine\nwhich of the statutory offenses (generic or non-generic)\nformed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. But here\nno uncertainty of that kind exists, and so the categorical\napproach needs no help from its modified partner. We\nknow Descamps\u2019 crime of conviction, and it does not corre-\nspond to the relevant generic offense. Under our prior\ndecisions, the inquiry is over.\n                              III\n   The Court of Appeals took a different view. Dismissing\neverything we have said on the subject as \u201clack[ing] con-\nclusive weight,\u201d the Ninth Circuit held in Aguila-Montes\nthat the modified categorical approach could turn a convic-\ntion under any statute into an ACCA predicate offense.\n655 F. 3d, at 931. The statute, like \u00a7459, could contain a\nsingle, indivisible set of elements covering far more con-\nduct than the generic crime\u2014and still, a sentencing court\ncould \u201cconside[r] to some degree the factual basis for the\ndefendant\u2019s conviction\u201d or, otherwise stated, \u201cthe particu-\nlar acts the defendant committed.\u201d Id., at 935\u2013936. More\nspecifically, the court could look to reliable materials (the\ncharging document, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and so\nforth) to determine \u201cwhat facts\u201d can \u201cconfident[ly]\u201d be\nthought to underlie the defendant\u2019s conviction in light of\nthe \u201cprosecutorial theory of the case\u201d and the \u201cfacts put\nforward by the government.\u201d Id., at 936\u2013937. It makes no\ndifference, in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, whether \u201cspecific\nwords in the statute\u201d of conviction \u201c \u2018 actually required\u2019 \u201d\nthe jury (or judge accepting a plea) \u201cto find a particular\ngeneric element.\u201d Id., at 936 (quoting Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n602; internal quotation marks omitted).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent, as we understand it, takes the same view as the Ninth\nCircuit; accordingly, each of the reasons\u2014statutory, constitutional, and\npractical\u2014that leads us to reject Aguila-Montes proves fatal to the\ndissent\u2019s position as well. The dissent several times obscures its call to\n                       Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                        11\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n  That approach\u2014which an objecting judge aptly called\n\u201cmodified factual,\u201d 655 F. 3d, at 948 (Berzon, J., concur-\nring in judgment)\u2014turns an elements-based inquiry into\nan evidence-based one. It asks not whether \u201cstatutory\ndefinitions\u201d necessarily require an adjudicator to find the\ngeneric offense, but instead whether the prosecutor\u2019s case\nrealistically led the adjudicator to make that determi-\nnation. And it makes examination of extra-statutory doc-\numents not a tool used in a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d to\nidentify the relevant element from a statute with multiple\nalternatives, but rather a device employed in every case to\nevaluate the facts that the judge or jury found. By this\npoint, it should be clear that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s new way of\nidentifying ACCA predicates has no roots in our precedents.\nBut more: Aguila-Montes subverts those decisions, conflict-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexplore facts with language from our categorical cases, asking whether\n\u201cthe relevant portions of the state record clearly show that the jury\nnecessarily found, or the defendant necessarily admitted, the elements\nof [the] generic [offense].\u201d Post, at 14; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 24 (plural-\nity opinion) (reiterating Taylor\u2019s \u201cdemanding requirement that . . . a\nprior conviction \u2018necessarily\u2019 involve[]\u201d a jury finding on each element\nof the generic offense) (emphasis added). But the dissent nowhere\nexplains how a factfinder can have \u201cnecessarily found\u201d a non-element\u2014\nthat is, a fact that by definition is not necessary to support a conviction.\nThe dissent\u2019s fundamental view is that a sentencing court should be\nable to make reasonable \u201cinference[s]\u201d about what the factfinder really\n(even though not necessarily) found. See post, at 15. That position\naccords with our dissenting colleague\u2019s previously expressed skepticism\nabout the categorical approach. See Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (\u201cI would hold that the\ncategorical approach is not controlling where the state conviction at\nissue was based on a state statute that encompasses both a substantial\nnumber of cases that qualify under the federal standard and a substan-\ntial number that do not. In such situations, it is appropriate to look\nbeyond the elements of the state offense and to rely as well on facts\nthat were admitted in state court or that, taking a realistic view, were\nclearly proved\u201d). But there are several decades of water over that dam,\nand the dissent offers no newly persuasive reasons for revisiting our\nprecedents.\n12              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning with each of the rationales supporting the categorical\napproach and threatening to undo all its benefits.\n                               A\n   This Court offered three grounds for establishing our\nelements-centric, \u201cformal categorical approach.\u201d Taylor,\n495 U. S., at 600. First, it comports with ACCA\u2019s text and\nhistory. Second, it avoids the Sixth Amendment concerns\nthat would arise from sentencing courts\u2019 making findings\nof fact that properly belong to juries. And third, it averts\n\u201cthe practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a\nfactual approach.\u201d Id., at 601. When assessed in light of\nthose three reasons, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling strikes out\nswinging.\n   Start with the statutory text and history. As we have\nlong recognized, ACCA increases the sentence of a defend-\nant who has three \u201cprevious convictions\u201d for a violent\nfelony\u2014not a defendant who has thrice committed such a\ncrime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1); see Taylor, 495 U. S., at 600.\nThat language shows, as Taylor explained, that \u201cCongress\nintended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that\nthe defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within\ncertain categories, and not to the facts underlying the\nprior convictions.\u201d Ibid.; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 19. If\nCongress had wanted to increase a sentence based on the\nfacts of a prior offense, it presumably would have said so;\nother statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.\nSee Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 36 (construing an immigration\nstatute as requiring a \u201c \u2018circumstance-specific,\u2019 not a \u2018cate-\ngorical,\u2019 \u201d approach). But in ACCA, Taylor found, Congress\nmade a deliberate decision to treat every conviction of a\ncrime in the same manner: During the lengthy debate\npreceding the statute\u2019s enactment, \u201cno one suggested that\na particular crime might sometimes count towards en-\nhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of\nthe case.\u201d 495 U. S., at 601. Congress instead meant\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nACCA to function as an on-off switch, directing that a\nprior crime would qualify as a predicate offense in all\ncases or in none.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach runs headlong into that\ncongressional choice. Instead of reviewing documents like\nan indictment or plea colloquy only to determine \u201cwhich\nstatutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,\u201d the\nNinth Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the\ndefendant actually did. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144. This\ncase demonstrates the point. Descamps was not convicted\nof generic burglary, because (as the Government agrees)\n\u00a7459 does not contain that crime\u2019s required unlawful-entry\nelement. See Brief for United States 38, 43\u201344. At most,\nthe colloquy showed that Descamps committed generic\nburglary, and so hypothetically could have been convicted\nunder a law criminalizing that conduct. But that is just\nwhat we said, in Taylor and elsewhere, is not enough. See\n495 U. S., at 600; Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting such a \u201c \u2018 hypothet-\nical approach\u2019 \u201d given a similar statute\u2019s directive to \u201clook\nto the conviction itself,\u201d rather than \u201cto what might have\nor could have been charged\u201d). And the necessary result of\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s method is exactly the differential\ntreatment we thought Congress, in enacting ACCA, took\ncare to prevent. In the two years since Aguila-Montes, the\nNinth Circuit has treated some, but not other, convictions\nunder \u00a7459 as ACCA predicates, based on minor varia-\ntions in the cases\u2019 plea documents. Compare, e.g., 466\nFed. Appx., at 565 (Descamps\u2019 \u00a7459 conviction counts as\ngeneric burglary), with 655 F. 3d, at 946 (Aguila-Montes\u2019\ndoes not).\n   Similarly, consider (though Aguila-Montes did not) the\ncategorical approach\u2019s Sixth Amendment underpinnings.\nWe have held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic-\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n14              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Under ACCA, the\ncourt\u2019s finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases\nthe maximum penalty. Accordingly, that finding would\n(at the least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it\nwent beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. Those\nconcerns, we recognized in Shepard, counsel against allow-\ning a sentencing court to \u201cmake a disputed\u201d determination\n\u201cabout what the defendant and state judge must have\nunderstood as the factual basis of the prior plea,\u201d or what\nthe jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory\nof the crime. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion); see id., at\n28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (stating that such a finding would \u201cgiv[e] rise to\nconstitutional error, not doubt\u201d). Hence our insistence on\nthe categorical approach.\n   Yet again, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling flouts our reasoning\u2014\nhere, by extending judicial factfinding beyond the recog-\nnition of a prior conviction. Our modified categorical\napproach merely assists the sentencing court in identify-\ning the defendant\u2019s crime of conviction, as we have held\nthe Sixth Amendment permits. But the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nreworking authorizes the court to try to discern what a\ntrial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the\ndefendant\u2019s underlying conduct. See Aguila-Montes, 655\nF. 3d, at 937. And there\u2019s the constitutional rub. The\nSixth Amendment contemplates that a jury\u2014not a sen-\ntencing court\u2014will find such facts, unanimously and\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. And the only facts the court\ncan be sure the jury so found are those constituting ele-\nments of the offense\u2014as distinct from amplifying but\nlegally extraneous circumstances. See, e.g., Richardson v.\nUnited States, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999). Similarly, as\nShepard indicated, when a defendant pleads guilty to a\ncrime, he waives his right to a jury determination of only\nthat offense\u2019s elements; whatever he says, or fails to say,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nabout superfluous facts cannot license a later sentencing\ncourt to impose extra punishment. See 544 U. S., at 24\u201326\n(plurality opinion). So when the District Court here en-\nhanced Descamps\u2019 sentence, based on his supposed acqui-\nescence to a prosecutorial statement (that he \u201cbroke and\nentered\u201d) irrelevant to the crime charged, the court did\njust what we have said it cannot: rely on its own finding\nabout a non-elemental fact to increase a defendant\u2019s max-\nimum sentence.\n   Finally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision creates the same\n\u201cdaunting\u201d difficulties and inequities that first encouraged\nus to adopt the categorical approach. Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n601\u2013602. In case after case, sentencing courts following\nAguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining\n(often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant\nadmitted in a plea colloquy, or a prosecutor showed at\ntrial, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of\nconviction, satisfy an element of the relevant generic\noffense. The meaning of those documents will often be\nuncertain. And the statements of fact in them may be\ndownright wrong. A defendant, after all, often has little\nincentive to contest facts that are not elements of the\ncharged offense\u2014and may have good reason not to. At\ntrial, extraneous facts and arguments may confuse the\njury. (Indeed, the court may prohibit them for that rea-\nson.) And during plea hearings, the defendant may not\nwish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling about\nsuperfluous factual allegations. In this case, for example,\nDescamps may have let the prosecutor\u2019s statement go by\nbecause it was irrelevant to the proceedings. He likely\nwas not thinking about the possibility that his silence\ncould come back to haunt him in an ACCA sentencing 30\nyears in the future. (Actually, he could not have been\nthinking that thought: ACCA was not even on the books at\nthe time of Descamps\u2019 burglary conviction.)\n   Still worse, the Aguila-Montes approach will deprive\n16              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea\ndeals. Assume (as happens every day) that a defendant\nsurrenders his right to trial in exchange for the govern-\nment\u2019s agreement that he plead guilty to a less serious\ncrime, whose elements do not match an ACCA offense.\nUnder the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, a later sentencing court\ncould still treat the defendant as though he had pleaded to\nan ACCA predicate, based on legally extraneous state-\nments found in the old record. Taylor recognized the\nproblem: \u201c[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense\nwas the result of a plea bargain,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cit\nwould seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if\nthe defendant had pleaded guilty\u201d to generic burglary.\n495 U. S., at 601\u2013602. That way of proceeding, on top of\neverything else, would allow a later sentencing court to\nrewrite the parties\u2019 bargain.\n                             B\n   The Ninth Circuit defended its (excessively) modified\napproach by denying any real distinction between divisible\nand indivisible statutes extending further than the generic\noffense. \u201cThe only conceptual difference,\u201d the court rea-\nsoned, \u201cis that [a divisible statute] creates an explicitly\nfinite list of possible means of commission, while [an\nindivisible one] creates an implied list of every means of\ncommission that otherwise fits the definition of a given\ncrime.\u201d Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927. For example,\nan indivisible statute \u201crequir[ing] use of a \u2018weapon\u2019 is not\nmeaningfully different\u201d\u2014or so says the Ninth Circuit\u2014\n\u201cfrom a statute that simply lists every kind of weapon in\nexistence . . . (\u2018gun, axe, sword, baton, slingshot, knife,\nmachete, bat,\u2019 and so on).\u201d Ibid. In a similar way, every\nindivisible statute can be imaginatively reconstructed as a\ndivisible one. And if that is true, the Ninth Circuit asks,\nwhy limit the modified categorical approach only to explic-\nitly divisible statutes?\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The simple answer is: Because only divisible statutes\nenable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge\nat a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every\nelement of the generic crime. A prosecutor charging a\nviolation of a divisible statute must generally select the\nrelevant element from its list of alternatives. See, e.g.,\nThe Confiscation Cases, 20 Wall. 92, 104 (1874) (\u201c[A]n\nindictment or a criminal information which charges the\nperson accused, in the disjunctive, with being guilty of one\nor of another of several offences, would be destitute of the\nnecessary certainty, and would be wholly insufficient\u201d).4\nAnd the jury, as instructions in the case will make clear,\nmust then find that element, unanimously and beyond a\nreasonable doubt. So assume, along the lines of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s example, that a statute criminalizes assault with\nany of eight specified weapons; and suppose further, as the\nNinth Circuit did, that only assault with a gun counts as\nan ACCA offense. A later sentencing court need only\ncheck the charging documents and instructions (\u201cDo they\nrefer to a gun or something else?\u201d) to determine whether\nin convicting a defendant under that divisible statute, the\njury necessarily found that he committed the ACCA-\nqualifying crime.\n  None of that is true of an overbroad, indivisible stat-\nute. A sentencing court, to be sure, can hypothetically\nreconceive such a statute in divisible terms. So, as Aguila-\nMontes reveals, a court blessed with sufficient time and\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See also 1 C. Wright & A. Leipold, Federal Practice and Procedure:\n\nCriminal \u00a7125, pp. 550\u2013551 (4th ed. 2008) (\u201cIf a single statute sets forth\nseveral different offenses, [a] pleading . . . that does not indicate which\ncrime [the] defendant allegedly committed is insufficient\u201d); 5 W.\nLaFave, J.

Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a719.3(a), p. 263\n(3d ed. 2007) (\u201c[W]here a statute specifies several different ways in\nwhich the crime can be committed, [courts often] hold that the pleading\nmust refer to the particular alternative presented in the individual\ncase\u201d).\n18              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimagination could devise a laundry list of potential\n\u201cweapons\u201d\u2014not just the eight the Ninth Circuit mentioned,\nbut also (for starters) grenades, pipe bombs, spears, tire\nirons, BB guns, nunchucks, and crossbows. But the thing\nabout hypothetical lists is that they are, well, hypothetical.\nAs long as the statute itself requires only an indeterminate\n\u201cweapon,\u201d that is all the indictment must (or is likely to)\nallege and all the jury instructions must (or are likely to)\nmention. And most important, that is all the jury must\nfind to convict the defendant. The jurors need not all\nagree on whether the defendant used a gun or a knife or a\ntire iron (or any other particular weapon that might ap-\npear in an imagined divisible statute), because the actual\nstatute requires the jury to find only a \u201cweapon.\u201d And\neven if in many cases, the jury could have readily reached\nconsensus on the weapon used, a later sentencing court\ncannot supply that missing judgment. Whatever the un-\nderlying facts or the evidence presented, the defendant\nstill would not have been convicted, in the deliberate and\nconsidered way the Constitution guarantees, of an offense\nwith the same (or narrower) elements as the supposed\ngeneric crime (assault with a gun).\n   Indeed, accepting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary reasoning\nwould altogether collapse the distinction between a cate-\ngorical and a fact-specific approach. After all, the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201cweapons\u201d example is just the tip of the iceberg:\nCourts can go much further in reconceiving indivisible\nstatutes as impliedly divisible ones. In fact, every element\nof every statute can be imaginatively transformed as the\nNinth Circuit suggests\u2014so that every crime is seen as\ncontaining an infinite number of sub-crimes corresponding\nto \u201call the possible ways an individual can commit\u201d it.\nAguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927.

(emphasis deleted), then the categorical\napproach is at an end. At that point, the court is merely\nasking whether a particular set of facts leading to a con-\nviction conforms to a generic ACCA offense. And that is\nwhat we have expressly and repeatedly forbidden. Courts\nmay modify the categorical approach to accommodate\nalternative \u201cstatutory definitions.\u201d Ibid.; cf.

They may not,\nby pretending that every fact pattern is an \u201cimplied\u201d\nstatutory definition, Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927,\nconvert that approach into its opposite.\n                             IV\n  The Government tries to distance itself from the Ninth\nCircuit by offering a purportedly narrower theory\u2014that\nalthough an indivisible statute that is \u201ctruly missing\u201d an\nelement of the generic offense cannot give rise to an ACCA\nconviction, California\u2019s burglary law can do so because it\nmerely \u201ccontains a broader version of the [generic] ele-\nment of unlawfulness of entry.\u201d Brief for United States\n11\u201312. The Government\u2019s argument proceeds in three\nsteps. It begins from the premise that sentencing courts\napplying ACCA should consider not only the statute defin-\ning a prior crime but also any judicial interpretations of it.\nNext, the Government points to a California decision\nholding (not surprisingly) that a defendant cannot \u201cbur-\nglariz[e] his own home\u201d; the case\u2019s reasoning, the Govern-\nment notes, is that \u00a7459 (though not saying so explicitly)\nrequires \u201can entry which invades a possessory right.\u201d\nPeople v. Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d 709, 713\u2013716, 542 P. 2d 1365,\n1367\u20131368 (1975). Given that precedent, the Government\ncontends, \u00a7459 includes a kind of \u201cunlawful entry\u201d ele-\n20                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment, although it is broader than the generic crime\u2019s\nanalogous requirement. Finally, the Government asserts\nthat sentencing courts may use the modified approach \u201cto\ndetermine whether a particular defendant\u2019s conviction\nunder\u201d such an overbroad statute actually \u201cwas for [the]\ngeneric\u201d crime. Brief for United States 11.\n  Although elaborately developed in the Government\u2019s\nbrief, this argument\u2019s first two steps turn out to be side-\nshows. We may reserve the question whether, in deter-\nmining a crime\u2019s elements, a sentencing court should take\naccount not only of the relevant statute\u2019s text, but of judi-\ncial rulings interpreting it. And we may assume, as the\nGovernment insists, that California caselaw treats \u00a7459 as\nincluding an element of entry \u201cinvading a possessory\nright\u201d\u2014although, truth be told, we find the state decisions\non that score contradictory and confusing.5 Even on those\nassumptions, \u00a7459\u2019s elements do not come into line with\ngeneric burglary\u2019s. As the Government concedes, almost\nevery entry onto another\u2019s property with intent to steal\u2014\nincluding, for example, a shoplifter\u2019s walking into an open\nstore\u2014\u201cinvades a possessory right\u201d under \u00a7459. See Brief\nfor United States 38; Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d, at 714, 542 P. 2d,\nat 1367. By contrast, generic burglary\u2019s unlawful-entry\nelement excludes any case in which a person enters prem-\nises open to the public, no matter his intent; the generic\ncrime requires breaking and entering or similar unlawful\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Several decisions treat \u201cinvasion of a possessory right\u201d as an aspect\nof \u00a7459\u2019s entry element, see, e.g., People v. Waidla, 22 Cal. 4th 690, 723,\n996 P. 2d 46, 65 (2000); Fortes v. Sacramento Munic. Ct. Dist., 113 Cal.\nApp. 3d 704, 712\u2013714, 170 Cal. Rptr. 292, 296\u2013297 (1980), but others\nview the issue of possessory right as bearing only on the affirmative\ndefense of consent, see, e.g., People v. Sherow, 196 Cal. App. 4th 1296,\n1303\u20131305, 1311, and n. 9, 128 Cal. Rptr. 3d 255, 260\u2013261, 266, and\nn. 9 (2011); People v. Felix, 23 Cal. App. 4th 1385, 1397, 28 Cal. Rptr.\n2d 860, 867 (1994). And California\u2019s pattern jury instructions do not\nrequire the jury to find invasion of a possessory right before convicting\na defendant of burglary. See 1 Cal. Jury Instr., Crim., No. 1700 (2012).\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)         21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity. See Brief for United States 38; LaFave \u00a721.1(a).\nSo everything rests on the Government\u2019s third point: that\nthis mismatch does not preclude applying the modified\ncategorical approach, because it results not from a missing\nelement but instead from an element\u2019s overbreadth.\n   But for starters, we see no principled way to make that\ndistinction. Most overbroad statutes can also be charac-\nterized as missing an element; and most statutes missing\nan element can also be labeled overbroad. Here is the only\nconclusion in Aguila-Montes we agree with: \u201c[I]t is diffi-\ncult, if not impossible\u201d to determine which is which. 655\nF. 3d, at 925. The example that court gave was as follows:\nA statute of conviction punishes possession of pornogra-\nphy, but a federal law carries a sentence enhancement for\npossession of child pornography. Is the statute of convic-\ntion overbroad because it includes both adult and child\npornography; or is that law instead missing the element of\ninvolvement of minors? The same name game can be\nplayed with \u00a7459. The Government labors mightily to\nturn what it fears looks like a missing-element statute\ninto an overbroad statute through the incorporation of\njudicial decisions. But even putting those decisions aside,\nthe Government might have described \u00a7459 as merely\nhaving an overbroad element because \u201centry\u201d includes\nboth the lawful and the unlawful kind. And conversely,\nDescamps could claim that even as judicially inter-\npreted, \u00a7459 is entirely missing generic burglary\u2019s ele-\nment of breaking and entering or similar unlawful conduct.\nAll is in the eye of the beholder, and prone to endless\nmanipulation.\n   In any event, and more fundamentally, we see no reason\nwhy the Government\u2019s distinction should matter. Whether\nthe statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing\nelement, the problem is the same: Because of the mis-\nmatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute\nis never convicted of the generic crime. In this case, for\n22                DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nexample, Descamps was not convicted of generic burglary\nbecause \u00a7459, whether viewed as missing an element or\ncontaining an overbroad one, does not require breaking\nand entering. So every reason we have given\u2014textual,\nconstitutional, and practical\u2014for rejecting the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s proposed approach applies to the Government\u2019s\nas well. See supra, at 12\u201316. At bottom, the Government\nwants the same thing as the Ninth Circuit (if nominally in\na few fewer cases): It too wishes a sentencing court to look\nbeyond the elements to the evidence or, otherwise said, to\nexplore whether a person convicted of one crime could also\nhave been convicted of another, more serious offense. But\nthat circumstance-specific review is just what the categor-\nical approach precludes. And as we have explained, we\nadopted the modified approach to help implement the\ncategorical inquiry, not to undermine it.\n                            V\n   Descamps may (or may not) have broken and entered,\nand so committed generic burglary. But \u00a7459\u2014the crime\nof which he was convicted\u2014does not require the factfinder\n(whether jury or judge) to make that determination.\nBecause generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an\nalternative element, of \u00a7459, a conviction under that\nstatute is never for generic burglary. And that decides\nthis case in Descamps\u2019 favor; the District Court should not\nhave enhanced his sentence under ACCA.6 That court and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Government here forfeited an alternative argument that \u00a7459\n\nqualifies as a predicate offense under ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause,\u201d which\ncovers statutes \u201cinvolv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We\nexpress no view on that argument\u2019s merits. Compare United States v.\nMayer, 560 F. 3d 948, 960\u2013963 (CA9 2009) (holding that Oregon\u2019s\nburglary statute falls within the residual clause, even though it does\nnot include all of generic burglary\u2019s elements), with id., at 951\n(Kozinski, C.

S. ____ (2013)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Ninth Circuit erred in invoking the modified categori-\ncal approach to look behind Descamps\u2019 conviction in\nsearch of record evidence that he actually committed the\ngeneric offense. The modified approach does not authorize\na sentencing court to substitute such a facts-based inquiry\nfor an elements-based one. A court may use the modified\napproach only to determine which alternative element in a\ndivisible statute formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s con-\nviction.

Aguila-Montes de\nOca, 655 F. 3d 915 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Beardsley, 691 F. 3d 252 (CA2 2012).\nThis category is used to describe a class of criminal stat-\nutes that are drafted with a single set of elements that are\nbroader than those of the generic definition of the corre-\nsponding crime enumerated in the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   Just one of the substantial concerns that the Court\nis correct to consider is that, in the regular course of the\ncriminal process, convictions may be entered, often by\nguilty pleas, when either the attorney or the client, or\nboth, have given no consideration to possible later conse-\nquences under ACCA. See ante, at 15\u201316. As a result,\ncertain facts in the documents approved for judicial exam-\nination in Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005),\nmay go uncontested because they do not alter the sentenc-\ning consequences of the crime, even though their effect is\nto require a later enhancement under ACCA. This signifi-\ncant risk of failing to consider the full consequences of the\nplea and conviction is troubling.\n2              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\n   Balanced against this, as JUSTICE ALITO indicates, is\nthat the dichotomy between divisible and indivisible state\ncriminal statutes is not all that clear. See post, at 12\u201313\n(dissenting opinion). The effect of today\u2019s decision, more-\nover, is that an unspecified number, but likely a large\nnumber, of state criminal statutes that are indivisible but\nthat often do reach serious crimes otherwise subject to\nACCA\u2019s provisions, now must be amended by state legisla-\ntures. Otherwise, they will not meet federal requirements\neven though they would have come within ACCA\u2019s terms\nhad the state statute been drafted in a different way. This\nis an intrusive demand on the States.\n   On due consideration, the concerns well expressed by\nthe Court persuade me that it reaches the correct result.\nThe disruption to the federal policy underlying ACCA,\nnevertheless, is troubling and substantial. See post, at 13\u2013\n14 (ALITO, J., dissenting). If Congress wishes to pursue\nits policy in a proper and efficient way without mandat-\ning uniformity among the States with respect to their\ncriminal statutes for scores of serious offenses, and with-\nout requiring the amendment of any number of federal\ncriminal statutes as well, Congress should act at once. It\nmay then determine whether ACCA\u2019s design and structure\nshould be modified to meet the concerns expressed both by\nthe Court and the dissenting opinion.\n   With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S. C. \u00a7922(g), which\nsubjected him to a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 impris-\nonment. The District Court, however, applied an Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement with a manda-\ntory minimum of 15 years based in part on Descamps\u2019\nearlier California conviction for burglary. See \u00a7924(e).\nThe California law says that any \u201cperson who enters\u201d any\nof a number of structures \u201cwith intent to commit grand or\npetit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d Califor-\nnia Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West 2010). That law does\nnot, on its face, require the jury to determine whether the\nentry itself was unlawful, a required element of the so-\ncalled \u201cgeneric\u201d offense of burglary that qualifies as an\nACCA predicate. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S.\n575, 599 (1990). The majority holds that a court may not\nreview the underlying facts of Descamps\u2019 state crime to\ndetermine whether he entered the building unlawfully\nand, thus, that his burglary conviction may not be used as\na predicate offense under ACCA. While I agree with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion, I disagree with its reasoning.\n   I have previously explained that ACCA runs afoul of\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), because it\nallows the judge to \u201cmak[e] a finding that raises [a de-\n2               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfendant\u2019s] sentence beyond the sentence that could have\nlawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by\nthe jury or admitted by the defendant.\u201d James v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 192, 231 (2007) (dissenting opinion)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the logic of\nApprendi, a court may not find facts about a prior convic-\ntion when such findings increase the statutory maximum.\nThis is so whether a court is determining whether a\nprior conviction was entered, see 530 U. S., at 520\u2013521\n(THOMAS, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what\nfacts were necessary to a prior conviction. See James, su-\npra, at 231\u2013232 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). In either case,\nthe court is inappropriately finding a fact that must be\nsubmitted to the jury because it \u201cincreases the penalty for\na crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d\nApprendi, supra, at 490.\n   In light of the foregoing, it does not matter whether a\nstatute is \u201cdivisible\u201d or \u201cindivisible,\u201d see ante, at 1\u20132, and\ncourts should not have to struggle with the contours of\nthe so-called \u201cmodified categorical\u201d approach. Ibid. The\nonly reason Descamps\u2019 ACCA enhancement is before us is\n\u201cbecause this Court has not yet reconsidered Almendarez-\nTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), which draws\nan exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial\nfactfinding that concerns a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\u201d\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 27 (2005)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment). Regardless of the framework adopted, judicial\nfactfinding increases the statutory maximum in violation\nof the Sixth Amendment. However, because today\u2019s opin-\nion at least limits the situations in which courts make\nfactual determinations about prior convictions, I concur in\nthe judgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

This is so, according to the Court,\nbecause (1) burglary under California law is broader than\nso-called \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d\u2014unlawfully entering or re-\nmaining in a building with the intent to commit a crime;\n(2) the California burglary statute is not \u201cdivisible\u201d; and\n(3) our \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d cannot be used in a\ncase involving an indivisible statute.

When it is\nclear that a defendant necessarily admitted or the jury\nnecessarily found that the defendant committed the ele-\nments of generic burglary, the conviction should qualify.\nPetitioner\u2019s burglary conviction meets that requirement,\nand I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                            I\n  Before petitioner was charged in the case now before us,\n2               DESCAMPS v.

See App. 11a\u201312a; 466 Fed. Appx. 563,\n565 (CA9 2012). After his release from custody for these\nearlier crimes, petitioner fired a gun in the direction of a\nman who supposedly owed him money for methampheta-\nmine, and as a result, he was charged in federal court with\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of\n\u00a7922(g)(1). A jury found him guilty, and the District Court\nimposed an enhanced sentence under ACCA because he\nhad the requisite number of previous convictions for \u201ca\nviolent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d \u00a7924(e). ACCA\ndefines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include a \u201cburglary\u201d that is\n\u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\nyear,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), and both the District Court and the\nCourt of Appeals found that petitioner\u2019s California bur-\nglary conviction fit this definition.\n   While the concept of a conviction for burglary might\nseem simple, things have not worked out that way under\nour case law. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n599 (1990), we held that \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA means\nwhat we called \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d that is, the \u201cunlawful or\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or\nstructure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d Determining\nwhether a burglary conviction qualifies under this defini-\ntion is easy if the elements set out in the state statute are\nthe same as or narrower than the elements of generic\nburglary, see ibid., but what if the state offense is broader?\nIn that event, we have held, a federal court may sometimes\napply what we have termed the \u201cmodified categorical\napproach,\u201d that is, it may examine some items in the\nstate-court record, including charging documents, jury\ninstructions, and statements made at guilty plea proceed-\nings, to determine if the defendant was actually found to\nhave committed the elements of the generic offense.

S. 13, 20 (2005); Taylor,\nsupra, at 602.\n   Petitioner argues that his 1978 conviction for burglary\nunder California Penal Code \u00a7459 does not qualify as a\nburglary conviction for ACCA purposes because of the\nparticular way in which this provision is worded. Section\n459 provides that a \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations\n\u201cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony\nis guilty of burglary.\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West\n2010). This provision is broader than generic burglary in\ntwo respects.\n   The first, which does not preclude application of the\nmodified categorical approach, concerns the place burglar-\nized. While generic burglary applies only to offenses\ninvolving the entry of a building, the California provision\nalso reaches offenses involving the entry of some other\nlocations, see ibid. Under our cases, however, a federal\ncourt considering whether to apply ACCA may determine,\nbased on an examination of certain relevant documents,\nwhether the conviction was actually based on the entry of\na building and, if it was, may impose an increased sen-\ntence. See Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144\n(2010); Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 35 (2009); Shep-\nard, supra, at 26.\n   The second variation is more consequential. Whereas\ngeneric burglary requires an entry that is unlawful or\nunprivileged, the California statute refers without qualifi-\ncation to \u201c[e]very person who enters.\u201d \u00a7459. Petitioner\nargues, and the Court agrees, that this discrepancy ren-\nders the modified categorical approach inapplicable to his\nCalifornia burglary conviction.\n                            II\n  The Court holds that \u201csentencing courts may not apply\nthe modified categorical approach when the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of\n4               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nelements.\u201d Ante, at 2. Because the Court\u2019s holding is\nbased on the distinction between \u201cdivisible\u201d and \u201cindivisi-\nble\u201d statutes, it is important to identify precisely what this\ntaxonomy means.\n   My understanding is that a statute is divisible, in the\nsense used by the Court, only if the offense in question\nincludes as separate elements all of the elements of the\ngeneric offense. By an element, I understand the Court to\nmean something on which a jury must agree by the vote\nrequired to convict under the law of the applicable juris-\ndiction. See ante, at 14 (citing Richardson v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999)). And although the Court\nreserves decision on the question whether a sentencing\ncourt may take authoritative judicial decisions into ac-\ncount in identifying the elements of a statute, see ante, at\n20, I will assume that a sentencing court may do so. While\nthe elements of a criminal offense are generally set out in\nthe statutory text, courts sometimes find that unmen-\ntioned elements are implicit. See, e.g., Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 20 (1999) (holding that federal mail\nfraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes require proof of\nmateriality even though that element is not mentioned in\nthe statutory text). I cannot think of any reason why an\nauthoritative decision of this sort should be ignored, and\nthe Court has certainly not provided any. I therefore\nproceed on the assumption that a statute is divisible if the\noffense, as properly construed, has the requisite elements.\n   The Court\u2019s holding that the modified categorical ap-\nproach may be used only when a statute is divisible in this\nsense is not required by ACCA or by our prior cases and\nwill cause serious practical problems.\n                          A\n  Nothing in the text of ACCA mandates the Court\u2019s\nexclusive focus on the elements of an offense.

C.\n\u00a7924(e)(1) (emphasis added), and the Court claims that the\nword \u201cconvictions\u201d mandates a narrow, elements-based\ninquiry, see ante, at 12. But \u201c[i]n ordinary speech, when it\nis said that a person was convicted of or for doing some-\nthing, the \u2018something\u2019 may include facts that go beyond\nthe bare elements of the relevant criminal offense.\u201d\nMoncrieffe v.

S. ___, ___ (2013) (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 10\u201311).\n   Nor is an exclusively elements-based inquiry mandated\nby ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime . . .\nthat . . . is burglary,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In drafting that\nprovision, Congress did not say \u201cany crime that has the\nelements of burglary.\u201d Indeed, the fact that Congress\nreferred to \u201celements\u201d elsewhere in the same subpara-\ngraph, see \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d to\nmean any crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another\u201d (emphasis added)), but omitted any\nreference to elements from \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) suggests, if\nanything, that it did not intend to focus exclusively on\nelements. Cf. Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v.\nNovo Nordisk A/S, 566 U.

In at least three of those cases, the\nCourt thought that the modified categorical approach could\nbe used in relation to statutes that may not have been\ndivisible.\n   Shepard concerned prior convictions under two Massa-\nchusetts burglary statutes that applied not only to the\nentry of a \u201cbuilding\u201d (as is the case with generic burglary)\n6              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbut also to the entry of a \u201cship, vessel, or vehicle.\u201d Mass.\nGen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, \u00a716 (West 2000). See also \u00a718;\n544 U. S., at 17. And the Shepard Court did not think\nthat this feature of the Massachusetts statutes precluded\nthe application of the modified categorical approach. See\nid., at 25\u201326; ante, at 6\u20137. See also Nijhawan, 557 U. S.,\nat 35 (discussing Shepard).\n   In today\u2019s decision, the Court assumes that \u201cbuilding\u201d\nand the other locations enumerated in the Massachusetts\nstatutes, such as \u201cvessel,\u201d were alternative elements, but\nthat is questionable. It is quite likely that the entry of a\nbuilding and the entry of a vessel were simply alternative\nmeans of satisfying an element. See Commonwealth v.\nCabrera, 449 Mass. 825, 827, 874 N. E. 2d 654, 657 (2007)\n(\u201cThe elements of breaking and entering in the nighttime\nwith intent to commit a felony are (1) breaking and (2)\nentering a building, ship, vessel or vehicle belonging\nto another (3) at night, (4) with the intent to commit a\nfelony\u201d). \u201c[L]egislatures frequently enumerate alternative\nmeans of committing a crime without intending to define\nseparate elements or separate crimes.\u201d Schad v. Arizona,\n501 U. S. 624, 636 (1991) (plurality). The feature that\ndistinguishes elements and means is the need for juror\nagreement, see Richardson, supra, at 817, and therefore in\ndetermining whether the entry of a building and the entry\nof a vessel are elements or means, the critical question is\nwhether a jury would have to agree on the nature of the\nplace that a defendant entered.\n   A case that we decided earlier this Term illustrates why\n\u201cbuilding\u201d and \u201cvessel\u201d may have been means and not\nseparate elements. In Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 568 U. S.\n___ (2013), we were required to determine whether a\n\u201cfloating home\u201d (a buoyant but not very sea-worthy dwell-\ning) was a \u201cvessel.\u201d Seven of us thought it was not; two of\nus thought it might be. Compare id., at ___ (slip op. at 1),\nwith id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissent-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\ning). Suppose that a defendant in Massachusetts was\ncharged with breaking into a structure like the Lozman\nfloating home. In order to convict, would it be necessary\nfor the jury to agree whether this structure was a \u201cbuild-\ning\u201d or a \u201cvessel\u201d? If some jurors insisted it was a building\nand others were convinced it was a vessel, would the jury\nbe hung? The Court\u2019s answer is \u201cyes.\u201d According to the\nCourt, if a defendant had been charged with burglarizing\nthe Lozman floating home and this Court had been sitting\nas the jury, the defendant would have escaped conviction\nfor burglary, no matter how strong the evidence, because\nthe \u201cjury\u201d could not agree on whether he burglarized a\nbuilding or a vessel.\n   I have not found a Massachusetts decision squarely on\npoint, but there is surely an argument that the Massachu-\nsetts Legislature did not want to demand juror agreement\non this question. In other words, there is a strong argu-\nment that entry of a \u201cbuilding\u201d and entry of a \u201cvessel\u201d are\nmerely alternative means, not alternative elements. And\nif that is so, the reasoning in Shepard undermines the\nCourt\u2019s argument that the modified categorical approach\nfocuses solely on elements and not on conduct.\n   Johnson, like Shepard, involved a statute that may have\nset out alternative means, rather than alternative ele-\nments. Under the Florida statute involved in that case, a\nbattery occurs when a person either \u201c1. [a]ctually and\nintentionally touches or strikes another person against the\nwill of the other; or 2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm\nto another person.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(a) (2010). It is a\ndistinct possibility (one not foreclosed by any Florida\ndecision of which I am aware) that a conviction under this\nprovision does not require juror agreement as to whether a\ndefendant firmly touched or lightly struck the victim.\nNevertheless, in Johnson, we had no difficulty concluding\n8                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the modified categorical approach could be applied.1\nSee 559 U. S., at 137.2\n  Far from mandating the Court\u2019s approach, these deci-\nsions support a practical understanding of the modified\ncategorical approach. Thus, in Shepard, we observed that\nthe factual circumstances of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction\nmay be relevant to determining whether it qualifies as a\nviolent felony under ACCA. See 544 U. S., at 20\u201321\n(\u201cWith such material in a pleaded case, a later court could\ngenerally tell whether the plea had \u2018necessarily\u2019 rested on\nthe fact identifying the burglary as generic, just as the\ndetails of instructions could support that conclusion in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n   1 However, because the Shepard documents did not reveal whether\n\nJohnson had been found to have touched or struck, we had to determine\nwhether the relatively innocuous phrase\u2014\u201c[a]ctually and intentionally\ntouch[ing]\u201d another person\u2014constituted physical force for purposes of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 137.\n   2 The remaining case, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990),\n\nmay also have involved a statute that was not divisible, but the situa-\ntion is less clear. There, the defendant had several Missouri burglary\nconvictions, and Missouri had several different burglary provisions in\neffect at the time in question. See id., at 578, n. 1. The particular\nprovision involved in each of those cases was not certain. Ibid. At least\none of those provisions, however, may not have been divisible. That\nprovision, Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7560.070 (1969) (repealed), applied not only to\nbuildings but also to \u201cany booth or tent,\u201d \u201cany boat or vessel,\u201d or a\n\u201crailroad car.\u201d It is not entirely clear whether a Missouri court would\nhave required jurors to agree on a particular choice from this list. In\nState v. Vandergriff, 403 S. W. 2d 579, 581 (Mo. 1966), the Missouri\nSupreme Court held that an information was deficient because it\n\u201comitted a description of the type of building that might be burglarized\nas defined by \u00a7560.070, and thereby omitted an essential element of the\noffense of burglary in the second degree.\u201d Because an information must\ngenerally include factual details that go beyond the elements of an\noffense, see 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal\nProcedure \u00a719.3(b), p. 276 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave), it is\npossible that the Missouri court did not mean to say that the type of\nbuilding was an element in the sense in which I understand the Court\nto use the term here.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And in Nijhawan, we departed from the\ncategorical approach altogether and instead applied a\n\u201ccircumstance-specific\u201d approach. See 557 U. S., at 36,\n38. If anything, then, Nijhawan undermines the major-\nity\u2019s position that rigid adherence to elements is always\nrequired.\n                             C\n  The Court fears that application of the modified categor-\nical approach to statutes such as \u00a7459 would be unfair to\ndefendants, who \u201coften ha[ve] little incentive to contest\nfacts that are not elements of the charged offense\u201d and\n\u201cmay not wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling\nabout superfluous factual allegations.\u201d Ante, at 15. This\nargument attributes to criminal defendants and their\nattorneys a degree of timidity that may not be realistic.\nBut in any event, even if a defendant does not think it\nworthwhile to \u201csquabbl[e]\u201d about insignificant factual\nallegations, a defendant clearly has an incentive to dispute\nallegations that may have a bearing on his sentence. And\nthat will often be the case when alternative elements or\nmeans suggest different degrees of culpability. Cf. Cal.\n10              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a7460 (providing that burglary of certain\ninhabited locations enumerated in \u00a7459 is punishable in\nthe first degree, and that burglary of all other locations is\npunishable in the second degree).\n                              D\n  The Court\u2019s approach, I must concede, does have one\nbenefit: It provides an extra measure of assurance that a\nburglary conviction will not be counted as an ACCA predi-\ncate unless the defendant, if he went to trial, was actually\nfound by a jury to have committed the elements of the\ngeneric offense. But this extra bit of assurance will gener-\nally be quite modest at best.\n  To see why this is so, compare what would happen\nunder an indivisible burglary statute that simply requires\nentry invading a possessory right, and a divisible statute\nthat has the following two alternative elements: (1) entry\nby trespass and (2) entry by invitation but with an undis-\nclosed criminal intent. Under the former statute, the jury\nwould be required to agree only that the defendant invaded\na possessory right when entering the place in question,\nand therefore it would be possible for the jury to convict\neven if some jurors thought that the defendant entered by\ntrespassing while others thought that he entered by invi-\ntation but with an undisclosed criminal intent. Under the\nlatter statute, by contrast, the jury would have to agree\neither that he trespassed or that he entered by invitation\nbut with an undisclosed criminal intent.\n  This requirement of unanimity would be of some practi-\ncal value only if the evidence in a case pointed to both\npossibilities, and in a great many cases that will not be so.\nIn cases prosecuted under the California burglary statute,\nI suspect, the evidence generally points either to a tres-\npassory entry, typically involving breaking into a building\nor other covered place, or to an entry by invitation but\nwith an undisclosed criminal intent (in many cases, shop-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlifting). Cases in which the evidence suggests that the\ndefendant might have done either are probably not com-\nmon. And in cases where there is evidence supporting\nboth theories, the presence of a divisible statute contain-\ning alternative elements will not solve the problem: A\nguilty verdict will not reveal the alternative on which the\njury agreed unless the jury was asked to return a special\nverdict, something that is not generally favored in crimi-\nnal cases. See 6 LaFave \u00a724.10(a), at 543\u2013544.\n   In cases that end with a guilty plea\u2014and most do\u2014the\nbenefit of divisibility is even less. A judge who accepts a\nguilty plea is typically required to confirm that there is a\nfactual basis for the plea, see 5 id., \u00a721.4(f), at 835\u2013840 (3d\ned. 2007 and Supp. 2011\u20132012), and the proffer of a factual\nbasis will generally focus exclusively on one of the\nalternative elements.\n   The Court nevertheless suggests that the extra modi-\ncum of assurance provided in cases involving divisible\nstatutes is needed to prevent violations of the Sixth\nAmendment jury trial right, ante, at 13\u201315, but I disagree.\nSo long as a judge applying ACCA is determining, not\nwhat the defendant did when the burglary in question was\ncommitted, but what the jury in that case necessarily\nfound or what the defendant, in pleading guilty, necessarily\nadmitted, the jury trial right is not infringed. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998).\nWhen the modified categorical approach is used to decide\nwhether \u201ca jury was actually required to find all the ele-\nments of [a] generic [offense],\u201d the defendant has already\nenjoyed his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determina-\ntion of those elements. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602.\n                             III\n  While producing very modest benefits at most, the\nCourt\u2019s holding will create several serious problems.\n12                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                             A\n\n  Determining whether a statute is divisible will often be\nharder than the Court acknowledges. What I have said\nabout the statutes involved in Shepard and Johnson illus-\ntrates this point. The Court assumes that those statutes\nwere divisible, but as I have explained, it is possible that\nthey were not. See supra, at 5\u20137.\n  To determine whether a statute contains alternative\nelements, as opposed to merely alternative means of satis-\nfying an element, a court called upon to apply ACCA will\nbe required to look beyond the text of the statute, which\nmay be deceptive. Take, for example, Michigan Compiled\nLaws Annotated \u00a7750.82(1) (West 2004), which criminal-\nizes assault with \u201ca gun, revolver, pistol, knife, iron bar,\nclub, brass knuckles, or other dangerous weapon.\u201d The\nCourt seems to assume that a statute like this enumerates\nalternative elements, ante, at 17\u201318, but the Michigan\ncourts have held otherwise. Under Michigan law, the\nelements of \u00a7750.82(1) are \u201c(1) an assault, (2) with a dan-\ngerous weapon, and (3) with the intent to injure or place\nthe victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate\nbattery.\u201d People v. Avant, 235 Mich. App. 499, 505, 597\nN. W. 2d 864, 869 (1999). Although the statute lists nu-\nmerous types of weapons, the particular type of weapon is\nnot itself an element that the prosecution must prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.

Charging documents must generally include factual\nallegations that go beyond the bare elements of the\ncrime\u2014specifically, at least enough detail to permit the\ndefendant to mount a defense. See 5 LaFave \u00a719.3(b), at\n276. And some jurisdictions require fairly specific factual\nallegations. See, e.g., N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. \u00a7200.50\n(West 2007) (enumerating detailed requirements for in-\ndictment); People v. Swanson, 308 Ill. App. 3d 708, 712,\n721 N.

Thus, the mere fact that state law requires a\nparticular fact to be alleged in a charging document does\nnot mean that this fact must be found by a jury or admit-\nted by the defendant.\n  The only way to be sure whether particular items are\nalternative elements or simply alternative means of satis-\nfying an element may be to find cases concerning the\ncorrectness of jury instructions that treat the items one way\nor the other. And such cases may not arise frequently.\nOne of the Court\u2019s reasons for adopting the modified cate-\ngorical approach was to simplify the work of ACCA\ncourts, see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 20; Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n601, but the Court\u2019s holding today will not serve that end.\n                          B\n  The Court\u2019s holding will also frustrate fundamental\n14              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nACCA objectives. We have repeatedly recognized that\nCongress enacted ACCA to ensure (1) that violent, dan-\ngerous recidivists would be subject to enhanced penalties\nand (2) that those enhanced penalties would be applied\nuniformly, regardless of state-law variations. See, e.g., id.,\nat 587\u2013589. See also id., at 582 (\u201c \u2018[I]n terms of fundamen-\ntal fairness, the Act should ensure, to the extent that it is\nconsistent with the prerogatives of the States in defining\ntheir own offenses, that the same type of conduct is pun-\nishable on the Federal level in all cases\u2019 \u201d (quoting S.

Defendants convicted of the ele-\nments of generic burglary in California will not be subject\nto ACCA, but defendants who engage in exactly the same\nbehavior in, say, Virginia, will fall within ACCA\u2019s reach.\nSee Va. Code Ann. \u00a718.2\u201390 (Lexis 2009).\n  I would avoid these problems by applying the modified\ncategorical approach to \u00a7459\u2014and any other similar bur-\nglary statute from another State\u2014and would ask whether\nthe relevant portions of the state record clearly show that\nthe jury necessarily found, or the defendant necessarily\nadmitted, the elements of generic burglary.

When the trial court inquired into the\nfactual basis for petitioner\u2019s plea, the prosecutor stated\nthat petitioner\u2019s crime involved \u201cthe breaking and entering\nof a grocery store.\u201d Id., at 25a. Neither petitioner nor his\nattorney voiced any objection.4 Ibid. In order to accept\npetitioner\u2019s plea, the trial court was required under Cali-\nfornia law to ensure that the plea had a factual basis, see\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71192.5 (1978); App. 26a, and we\nmust presume that the plea proceedings were conducted in\na regular manner, see Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29\u201330\n(1992). The unmistakable inference arising from the plea\ntranscript is that the trial judge\u2014quite reasonably\u2014\nunderstood petitioner and his attorney to assent to the\nfactual basis provided by the prosecutor. Both the District\nCourt and the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner\nhad admitted and, as a practical matter, was convicted for\nhaving committed the elements of generic burglary, and\nwe did not agree to review that fact-bound determination,\nsee 567 U. S. ___ (2012) (granting certiorari \u201climited to\nQuestion 1 presented by the petition\u201d).\n   Even if that determination is reviewed, however, the\nlower courts\u2019 conclusion should be sustained. Under the\nCalifornia burglary statute, as interpreted by the State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Ninth Circuit has held that a court applying the modified cate-\ngorical approach may rely on a prosecutor\u2019s statement as to the factual\nbasis for a guilty plea when that statement is offered on the record in\nthe defendant\u2019s presence and the defendant does not object. United\nStates v. Hernandez-Hernandez, 431 F. 3d 1212, 1219 (2005). Petitioner\nhas not challenged the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule, and that issue is not\nwithin the scope of the question on which we granted certiorari.\nAccordingly, I would apply it for purposes of this case.\n16                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nSupreme Court, a defendant must either (a) commit a\ntrespass in entering the location in question or (b) enter in\nviolation of some other possessory right. See People v.\nGauze, 15 Cal. 3d 709, 713\u2013714, 542 P. 2d 1365, 1367\n(1975).5\n  In this case, the judge who accepted petitioner\u2019s guilty\nplea must have relied on petitioner\u2019s implicit admission\nthat he \u201cbroke\u201d into the store, for if petitioner had admit-\nted only that he entered the store, the judge would not\nhave been able to assess whether he had invaded a posses-\nsory right. Nor would an admission to merely \u201centering\u201d\nthe store have permitted the judge to assess whether\npetitioner entered with the intent to commit a crime;\npetitioner\u2019s admission to \u201cbreaking\u201d was therefore critical\nto that element, as well. Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 236\n(rev. 4th ed. 1968) (\u201cBreaking\u201d denotes the \u201ctearing away\nor removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches,\nor other fastenings intended to secure it, or otherwise\nexerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to\ncommit a felony\u201d).\n  We have explained that burglary under \u00a7924(e) means\n\u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a\nbuilding or other structure, with intent to commit a\ncrime.\u201d Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598. Based on petitioner\u2019s\nguilty plea and the Shepard documents, it is clear that\npetitioner necessarily admitted the elements of generic\nburglary. He unlawfully entered a building with the\nintent to commit a crime. Accordingly, I would hold that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority suggests that California law is ambiguous as to this\nrequirement, see ante, at 20, n. 5, but any confusion appears to have\narisen after petitioner\u2019s 1978 conviction and is therefore irrelevant for\npurposes of this case.

Argued January 7, 2013\u2014Decided June 20, 2013\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) increases the sentences of cer-\n  tain federal defendants who have three prior convictions \u201cfor a vio-\n  lent felony,\u201d including \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7924(e). To determine whether a past conviction is for one of those\n  crimes, courts use a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d: They compare the statu-\n  tory elements of a prior conviction with the elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d\n  crime\u2015i.e., the offense as commonly understood. If the statute\u2019s ele-\n  ments are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense,\n  the prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. When a prior\n  conviction is for violating a \u201cdivisible statute\u201d\u2014one that sets out one\n  or more of the elements in the alternative, e.g., burglary involving en-\n  try into a building or an automobile\u2014a \u201cmodified categorical ap-\n  proach\u201d is used. That approach permits sentencing courts to consult\n  a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instruc-\n  tions, to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the\n  defendant\u2019s prior conviction.\n     Petitioner Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of\n  a firearm. The Government sought an ACCA sentence enhancement,\n  pointing to Descamps\u2019 three prior convictions, including one for bur-\n  glary under California Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459, which provides that a\n  \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations \u201cwith intent to commit grand or\n  petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d In imposing an en-\n  hanced sentence, the District Court rejected Descamps\u2019 argument\n  that his \u00a7459 conviction cannot serve as an ACCA predicate because\n  \u00a7459 goes beyond the \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary. The Ninth Cir-\n  cuit affirmed, holding that its decision in United States v. Aguila-\n  Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915, permits the application of the modified\n  categorical approach to a prior conviction under a statute that is\n2                   DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    \u201ccategorically broader than the generic offense.\u201d It found that\n    Descamps\u2019 \u00a7459 conviction, as revealed in the plea colloquy, rested on\n    facts satisfying the elements of generic burglary.\nHeld: The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes like\n \u00a7459 that contain a single, indivisible set of elements. Pp. 5\u221223.\n    (a) This Court\u2019s caselaw all but resolves this case. In Taylor v.\n United States, 495 U. S. 575, and Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S.\n 13, the Court approved the use of a modified categorical approach in\n a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d in which a divisible statute, listing poten-\n tial offense elements in the alternative, renders opaque which ele-\n ment played a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction. Because a sentenc-\n ing court cannot tell, simply by looking at a divisible statute, which\n version of the offense a defendant was convicted of, the court is per-\n mitted to consult extra-statutory documents\u2014but only to assess\n whether the defendant was convicted of the particular \u201cstatutory def-\n inition\u201d that corresponds to the generic offense. Nijhawan v. Holder,\n 557 U. S. 29, and Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, also em-\n phasized this elements-based rationale for the modified categorical\n approach. That approach plays no role here, where the dispute does\n not concern alternative elements but a simple discrepancy between\n generic burglary and \u00a7459. Pp. 5\u221210.\n    (b) The Ninth Circuit\u2019s Aguila-Montes approach turns an elements-\n based inquiry into an evidence-based one, asking not whether \u201cstatu-\n tory definitions\u201d necessarily require an adjudicator to find the generic\n offense, but whether the prosecutor\u2019s case realistically led the adjudi-\n cator to find certain facts. Aguila-Montes has no roots in this Court\u2019s\n precedents. In fact, it subverts those decisions, conflicting with each\n of the rationales supporting the categorical approach and threatening\n to undo all its benefits. Pp. 10\u201319.\n      (1) Taylor\u2019s elements-centric categorical approach comports with\n ACCA\u2019s text and history, avoids Sixth Amendment concerns that\n would arise from sentencing courts\u2019 making factual findings that\n properly belong to juries, and averts \u201cthe practical difficulties and po-\n tential unfairness of a factual approach.\u201d 495 U. S., at 601.\n    ACCA\u2019s language shows that Congress intended sentencing courts\n \u201cto look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of\n crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underly-\n ing the prior convictions.\u201d Id., at 600. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach\n runs headlong into that congressional choice. Instead of reviewing\n extra-statutory documents only to determine which alternative ele-\n ment was the basis for the conviction, the Circuit looks to those ma-\n terials to discover what the defendant actually did.\n    Under ACCA, the sentencing court\u2019s finding of a predicate offense\n indisputably increases the maximum penalty. Accordingly, that find-\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  ing would (at least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it\n  went beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. That is why\n  Shepard refused to permit sentencing courts to make a disputed de-\n  termination about what facts must have supported a defendant\u2019s\n  conviction. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion). Yet the Ninth Circuit\n  flouts this Court\u2019s reasoning by authorizing judicial factfinding that\n  goes far beyond the recognition of a prior conviction.\n     The Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision also creates the same \u201cdaunting\u201d diffi-\n  culties and inequities that first encouraged the adoption of the cate-\n  gorical approach. Sentencing courts following Aguila-Montes would\n  have to expend resources examining (often aged) documents for evi-\n  dence that a defendant admitted, or a prosecutor showed, facts that,\n  although unnecessary to the crime of conviction, satisfied an element\n  of the relevant generic offense. And the Aguila-Montes approach\n  would also deprive many defendants of the benefits of their negotiat-\n  ed plea deals. Pp. 12\u201316.\n        (2) In defending Aguila-Montes, the Ninth Circuit denied any\n  real distinction between divisible and indivisible statutes extending\n  further than the generic offense. But the Circuit\u2019s efforts to imagina-\n  tively reconceive all indivisible statutes as divisible ones are unavail-\n  ing. Only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude\n  that a jury (or judge at a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of\n  every element of the generic crime. Pp. 16\u221219.\n     (c) The Government offers a slightly different argument: It con-\n  tends that the modified categorical approach should apply where, as\n  here, the mismatch of elements between the crime of conviction and\n  the generic offense results not from a missing element but from an\n  element\u2019s overbreadth. But that distinction is malleable and manipu-\n  lable. And in any event, it is a distinction without a difference.\n  Whether the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing ele-\n  ment, the problem is the same: Because of the mismatch in ele-\n  ments, a person convicted under that statute is never convicted of the\n  generic crime. Pp. 19\u221222.\n     (d) Because generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an alter-\n  native element of, \u00a7459, a conviction under that statute is never for\n  generic burglary.

S. C. \u00a7924(e), increases the sentences of certain federal\ndefendants who have three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent\nfelony,\u201d including \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion.\u201d To de-\ntermine whether a past conviction is for one of those\ncrimes, courts use what has become known as the \u201ccate-\ngorical approach\u201d: They compare the elements of the stat-\nute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction with\nthe elements of the \u201cgeneric\u201d crime\u2014i.e., the offense as\ncommonly understood. The prior conviction qualifies as\nan ACCA predicate only if the statute\u2019s elements are the\nsame as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.\n   We have previously approved a variant of this method\u2014\nlabeled (not very inventively) the \u201cmodified categorical\napproach\u201d\u2014when a prior conviction is for violating a so-\ncalled \u201cdivisible statute.\u201d That kind of statute sets out one\nor more elements of the offense in the alternative\u2014for\nexample, stating that burglary involves entry into a build-\ning or an automobile. If one alternative (say, a building)\nmatches an element in the generic offense, but the other\n2               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(say, an automobile) does not, the modified categorical\napproach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited\nclass of documents, such as indictments and jury instruc-\ntions, to determine which alternative formed the basis of\nthe defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The court can then do\nwhat the categorical approach demands: compare the\nelements of the crime of conviction (including the alterna-\ntive element used in the case) with the elements of the\ngeneric crime.\n   This case presents the question whether sentencing\ncourts may also consult those additional documents when\na defendant was convicted under an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute\u2014\ni.e., one not containing alternative elements\u2014that crimi-\nnalizes a broader swath of conduct than the relevant\ngeneric offense. That would enable a court to decide,\nbased on information about a case\u2019s underlying facts, that\nthe defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA\npredicate even though the elements of the crime fail to\nsatisfy our categorical test. Because that result would\ncontravene our prior decisions and the principles underly-\ning them, we hold that sentencing courts may not apply\nthe modified categorical approach when the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of\nelements.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Michael Descamps was convicted of being a\nfelon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.

The Government, however,\nsought an enhanced sentence under ACCA, based on\nDescamps\u2019 prior state convictions for burglary, robbery,\nand felony harassment.\n   ACCA prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15\nyears for a person who violates \u00a7922(g) and \u201chas three\nprevious convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The Act defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d\nto mean any felony, whether state or federal, that \u201chas\nas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\nphysical force against the person of another,\u201d or that \u201cis\nburglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\notherwise involves conduct that presents a serious poten-\ntial risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B).\n   Descamps argued that his prior burglary conviction\ncould not count as an ACCA predicate offense under our\ncategorical approach. He had pleaded guilty to violating\nCalifornia Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West 2010), which pro-\nvides that a \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations \u201cwith\nintent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is\nguilty of burglary.\u201d That statute does not require the\nentry to have been unlawful in the way most burglary\nlaws do. Whereas burglary statutes generally demand\nbreaking and entering or similar conduct, California\u2019s does\nnot: It covers, for example, a shoplifter who enters a store,\nlike any customer, during normal business hours. See\nPeople v. Barry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483\u2013484, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026\u2013\n1027 (1892). In sweeping so widely, the state law goes\nbeyond the normal, \u201cgeneric\u201d definition of burglary. Ac-\ncording to Descamps, that asymmetry of offense elements\nprecluded his conviction under \u00a7459 from serving as an\nACCA predicate, whether or not his own burglary involved\nan unlawful entry that could have satisfied the require-\nments of the generic crime.\n   The District Court disagreed. According to the court,\nour modified categorical approach permitted it to examine\ncertain documents, including the record of the plea collo-\nquy, to discover whether Descamps had \u201cadmitted the\nelements of a generic burglary\u201d when entering his plea.\nApp. 50a. And that transcript, the court ruled, showed\nthat Descamps had done so. At the plea hearing, the\nprosecutor proffered that the crime \u201c \u2018 involve[d] the break-\ning and entering of a grocery store,\u2019 \u201d and Descamps failed\n4                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto object to that statement. Ibid. The plea proceed-\nings, the District Court thought, thus established that\nDescamps\u2019 prior conviction qualified as a generic burglary\n(and so as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d) under ACCA. Applying the\nrequisite penalty enhancement, the court sentenced\nDescamps to 262 months in prison\u2014more than twice the\nterm he would otherwise have received.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed,\nrelying on its recently issued decision in United States v.\nAguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d 915 (2011) (en banc) (per\ncuriam). There, a divided en banc court took much the\nsame view of the modified categorical approach as had\nthe District Court in this case. The en banc court held\nthat when a sentencing court considers a conviction under\n\u00a7459\u2014or any other statute that is \u201ccategorically broader\nthan the generic offense\u201d\u2014the court may scrutinize cer-\ntain documents to determine the factual basis of the con-\nviction. See id., at 940. Applying that approach, the\nCourt of Appeals here found that Descamps\u2019 plea, as re-\nvealed in the colloquy, \u201crested on facts that satisfy the\nelements of the generic definition of burglary.\u201d 466 Fed.\nAppx. 563, 565 (2012).\n  We granted certiorari, 567 U. S. ___ (2012), to resolve a\nCircuit split on whether the modified categorical approach\napplies to statutes like \u00a7459 that contain a single, \u201cindi-\nvisible\u201d set of elements sweeping more broadly than the\ncorresponding generic offense.1 We hold that it does not,\nand so reverse.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Compare, e.g., 466 Fed.

In those\ndecisions, as shown below, the modified approach serves a\nlimited function: It helps effectuate the categorical analy-\nsis when a divisible statute, listing potential offense ele-\nments in the alternative, renders opaque which element\nplayed a part in the defendant\u2019s conviction. So under-\nstood, the modified approach cannot convert Descamps\u2019\nconviction under \u00a7459 into an ACCA predicate, because\nthat state law defines burglary not alternatively, but only\nmore broadly than the generic offense.\n   We begin with Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575\n(1990), which established the rule for determining when\na defendant\u2019s prior conviction counts as one of ACCA\u2019s\nenumerated predicate offenses (e.g., burglary). Taylor\nadopted a \u201cformal categorical approach\u201d: Sentencing\ncourts may \u201clook only to the statutory definitions\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nthe elements\u2014of a defendant\u2019s prior offenses, and not \u201cto\nthe particular facts underlying those convictions.\u201d Id., at\n600. If the relevant statute has the same elements as the\n\u201cgeneric\u201d ACCA crime, then the prior conviction can serve\nas an ACCA predicate; so too if the statute defines the\ncrime more narrowly, because anyone convicted under\nthat law is \u201cnecessarily . . . guilty of all the [generic\ncrime\u2019s] elements.\u201d Id., at 599. But if the statute sweeps\nmore broadly than the generic crime, a conviction under\nthat law cannot count as an ACCA predicate, even if the\ndefendant actually committed the offense in its generic\nform. The key, we emphasized, is elements, not facts. So,\nfor example, we held that a defendant can receive an\nACCA enhancement for burglary only if he was convicted\nof a crime having \u201cthe basic elements\u201d of generic burglary\u2014\ni.e., \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining\nin, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d\nIbid. And indeed, we indicated that the very statute at\n6               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nissue here, \u00a7459, does not fit that bill because \u201cCalifornia\ndefines \u2018burglary\u2019 so broadly as to include shoplifting.\u201d Id.,\nat 591.\n  At the same time, Taylor recognized a \u201cnarrow range of\ncases\u201d in which sentencing courts\u2014applying what we\nwould later dub the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d\u2014may\nlook beyond the statutory elements to \u201cthe charging paper\nand jury instructions\u201d used in a case. Id., at 602. To\nexplain when courts should resort to that approach, we\nhypothesized a statute with alternative elements\u2014more\nparticularly, a burglary statute (otherwise conforming to\nthe generic crime) that prohibits \u201centry of an automobile\nas well as a building.\u201d Ibid. One of those alternatives (a\nbuilding) corresponds to an element in generic burglary,\nwhereas the other (an automobile) does not. In a typical\ncase brought under the statute, the prosecutor charges one\nof those two alternatives, and the judge instructs the jury\naccordingly. So if the case involves entry into a building,\nthe jury is \u201cactually required to find all the elements of\ngeneric burglary,\u201d as the categorical approach demands.\nIbid. But the statute alone does not disclose whether\nthat has occurred. Because the statute is \u201cdivisible\u201d\u2014i.e.,\ncomprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime\u2014a\nlater sentencing court cannot tell, without reviewing\nsomething more, if the defendant\u2019s conviction was for the\ngeneric (building) or non-generic (automobile) form of\nburglary. Hence Taylor permitted sentencing courts, as a\ntool for implementing the categorical approach, to examine\na limited class of documents to determine which of a stat-\nute\u2019s alternative elements formed the basis of the defend-\nant\u2019s prior conviction.\n  In Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005), the\nhypothetical we posited in Taylor became real: We con-\nfronted a Massachusetts burglary statute covering entries\ninto \u201cboats and cars\u201d as well as buildings. 544 U. S., at 17.\nThe defendant there pleaded guilty to violating the stat-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nute, and we first confirmed that Taylor\u2019s categorical ap-\nproach applies not just to jury verdicts, but also to plea\nagreements. That meant, we held, that a conviction based\non a guilty plea can qualify as an ACCA predicate only if\nthe defendant \u201cnecessarily admitted [the] elements of the\ngeneric offense.\u201d Id., at 26. But as we had anticipated in\nTaylor, the divisible nature of the Massachusetts burglary\nstatute confounded that inquiry: No one could know, just\nfrom looking at the statute, which version of the offense\nShepard was convicted of. Accordingly, we again author-\nized sentencing courts to scrutinize a restricted set of\nmaterials\u2014here, \u201cthe terms of a plea agreement or tran-\nscript of colloquy between judge and defendant\u201d\u2014to de-\ntermine if the defendant had pleaded guilty to entering a\nbuilding or, alternatively, a car or boat. Ibid. Yet we\nagain underscored the narrow scope of that review: It was\nnot to determine \u201cwhat the defendant and state judge\nmust have understood as the factual basis of the prior\nplea,\u201d but only to assess whether the plea was to the ver-\nsion of the crime in the Massachusetts statute (burglary of\na building) corresponding to the generic offense. Id., at\n25\u201326 (plurality opinion).\n  Two more recent decisions have further emphasized\nthe elements-based rationale\u2014applicable only to divisible\nstatutes\u2014for examining documents like an indictment or\nplea agreement. In Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29\n(2009), we discussed another Massachusetts statute, this\none prohibiting \u201c \u2018Breaking and Entering at Night\u2019 \u201d in any\nof four alternative places: a \u201cbuilding, ship, vessel, or\nvehicle.\u201d Id., at 35. We recognized that when a statute so\n\u201crefer[s] to several different crimes,\u201d not all of which qualify\nas an ACCA predicate, a court must determine which\ncrime formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. Ibid.\nThat is why, we explained, Taylor and Shepard developed\nthe modified categorical approach. By reviewing the\nextra-statutory materials approved in those cases, courts\n8                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncould discover \u201cwhich statutory phrase,\u201d contained within\na statute listing \u201cseveral different\u201d crimes, \u201ccovered a prior\nconviction.\u201d 557 U. S., at 41. And a year later, we repeated\nthat understanding of when and why courts can resort\nto those documents: \u201c[T]he \u2018modified categorical approach\u2019\nthat we have approved permits a court to determine which\nstatutory phrase was the basis for the conviction.\u201d John-\nson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144 (2010) (citation\nomitted).\n   Applied in that way\u2014which is the only way we have\never allowed\u2014the modified approach merely helps im-\nplement the categorical approach when a defendant was\nconvicted of violating a divisible statute. The modified\napproach thus acts not as an exception, but instead as a\ntool. It retains the categorical approach\u2019s central feature:\na focus on the elements, rather than the facts, of a crime.\nAnd it preserves the categorical approach\u2019s basic method:\ncomparing those elements with the generic offense\u2019s. All\nthe modified approach adds is a mechanism for making\nthat comparison when a statute lists multiple, alternative\nelements, and so effectively creates \u201cseveral different . . .\ncrimes.\u201d Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41. If at least one, but\nnot all of those crimes matches the generic version, a court\nneeds a way to find out which the defendant was convicted\nof. That is the job, as we have always understood it, of the\nmodified approach: to identify, from among several alter-\nnatives, the crime of conviction so that the court can com-\npare it to the generic offense.2\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Thedissent delves into the nuances of various States\u2019 laws in an\neffort to cast doubt on this understanding of our prior holdings, arguing\nthat we used the modified categorical approach in cases like Taylor,\nShepard, and Johnson \u201cin relation to statutes that may not have been\ndivisible\u201d in the way that we have just described. Post, at 5 (ALITO, J.).\nBut if, as the dissent claims, the state laws at issue in those cases set\nout \u201cmerely alternative means, not alternative elements\u201d of an offense,\npost, at 7, that is news to us. And more important, it would have been\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The modified approach thus has no role to play in this\ncase. The dispute here does not concern any list of alter-\nnative elements. Rather, it involves a simple discrepancy\nbetween generic burglary and the crime established in\n\u00a7459. The former requires an unlawful entry along the\nlines of breaking and entering. See 3 W. LaFave, Sub-\nstantive Criminal Law \u00a721.1(a) (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter\nLaFave). The latter does not, and indeed covers simple\nshoplifting, as even the Government acknowledges. See\nBrief for United States 38; Barry, 94 Cal., at 483\u2013484, 29\nP., at 1026\u20131027. In Taylor\u2019s words, then, \u00a7459 \u201cdefine[s]\nburglary more broadly\u201d than the generic offense. 495\nU. S., at 599. And because that is true\u2014because Califor-\nnia, to get a conviction, need not prove that Descamps\nbroke and entered\u2014a \u00a7459 violation cannot serve as an\nACCA predicate. Whether Descamps did break and enter\nmakes no difference. And likewise, whether he ever ad-\nmitted to breaking and entering is irrelevant. Our deci-\nsions authorize review of the plea colloquy or other\napproved extra-statutory documents only when a statute\ndefines burglary not (as here) overbroadly, but instead\nalternatively, with one statutory phrase corresponding to\nthe generic crime and another not. In that circumstance,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nnews to the Taylor, Shepard, and Johnson Courts: All those decisions\nrested on the explicit premise that the laws \u201ccontain[ed] statutory\nphrases that cover several different . . . crimes,\u201d not several different\nmethods of committing one offense. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144 (citing\nNijhawan, 557 U. S., at 41). And if the dissent\u2019s real point is that\ndistinguishing between \u201calternative elements\u201d and \u201calternative means\u201d\nis difficult, we can see no real-world reason to worry. Whatever a\nstatute lists (whether elements or means), the documents we approved\nin Taylor and Shepard\u2014i.e., indictment, jury instructions, plea collo-\nquy, and plea agreement\u2014would reflect the crime\u2019s elements. So a\ncourt need not parse state law in the way the dissent suggests: When a\nstate law is drafted in the alternative, the court merely resorts to the\napproved documents and compares the elements revealed there to those\nof the generic offense.\n10                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\na court may look to the additional documents to determine\nwhich of the statutory offenses (generic or non-generic)\nformed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction. But here\nno uncertainty of that kind exists, and so the categorical\napproach needs no help from its modified partner. We\nknow Descamps\u2019 crime of conviction, and it does not corre-\nspond to the relevant generic offense. Under our prior\ndecisions, the inquiry is over.\n                              III\n   The Court of Appeals took a different view. Dismissing\neverything we have said on the subject as \u201clack[ing] con-\nclusive weight,\u201d the Ninth Circuit held in Aguila-Montes\nthat the modified categorical approach could turn a convic-\ntion under any statute into an ACCA predicate offense.\n655 F. 3d, at 931. The statute, like \u00a7459, could contain a\nsingle, indivisible set of elements covering far more con-\nduct than the generic crime\u2014and still, a sentencing court\ncould \u201cconside[r] to some degree the factual basis for the\ndefendant\u2019s conviction\u201d or, otherwise stated, \u201cthe particu-\nlar acts the defendant committed.\u201d Id., at 935\u2013936. More\nspecifically, the court could look to reliable materials (the\ncharging document, jury instructions, plea colloquy, and so\nforth) to determine \u201cwhat facts\u201d can \u201cconfident[ly]\u201d be\nthought to underlie the defendant\u2019s conviction in light of\nthe \u201cprosecutorial theory of the case\u201d and the \u201cfacts put\nforward by the government.\u201d Id., at 936\u2013937. It makes no\ndifference, in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, whether \u201cspecific\nwords in the statute\u201d of conviction \u201c \u2018 actually required\u2019 \u201d\nthe jury (or judge accepting a plea) \u201cto find a particular\ngeneric element.\u201d Id., at 936 (quoting Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n602; internal quotation marks omitted).3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The dissent, as we understand it, takes the same view as the Ninth\nCircuit; accordingly, each of the reasons\u2014statutory, constitutional, and\npractical\u2014that leads us to reject Aguila-Montes proves fatal to the\ndissent\u2019s position as well. The dissent several times obscures its call to\n                       Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                        11\n\n                            Opinion of the Court\n\n  That approach\u2014which an objecting judge aptly called\n\u201cmodified factual,\u201d 655 F. 3d, at 948 (Berzon, J., concur-\nring in judgment)\u2014turns an elements-based inquiry into\nan evidence-based one. It asks not whether \u201cstatutory\ndefinitions\u201d necessarily require an adjudicator to find the\ngeneric offense, but instead whether the prosecutor\u2019s case\nrealistically led the adjudicator to make that determi-\nnation. And it makes examination of extra-statutory doc-\numents not a tool used in a \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d to\nidentify the relevant element from a statute with multiple\nalternatives, but rather a device employed in every case to\nevaluate the facts that the judge or jury found. By this\npoint, it should be clear that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s new way of\nidentifying ACCA predicates has no roots in our precedents.\nBut more: Aguila-Montes subverts those decisions, conflict-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nexplore facts with language from our categorical cases, asking whether\n\u201cthe relevant portions of the state record clearly show that the jury\nnecessarily found, or the defendant necessarily admitted, the elements\nof [the] generic [offense].\u201d Post, at 14; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 24 (plural-\nity opinion) (reiterating Taylor\u2019s \u201cdemanding requirement that . . . a\nprior conviction \u2018necessarily\u2019 involve[]\u201d a jury finding on each element\nof the generic offense) (emphasis added). But the dissent nowhere\nexplains how a factfinder can have \u201cnecessarily found\u201d a non-element\u2014\nthat is, a fact that by definition is not necessary to support a conviction.\nThe dissent\u2019s fundamental view is that a sentencing court should be\nable to make reasonable \u201cinference[s]\u201d about what the factfinder really\n(even though not necessarily) found. See post, at 15. That position\naccords with our dissenting colleague\u2019s previously expressed skepticism\nabout the categorical approach. See Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (\u201cI would hold that the\ncategorical approach is not controlling where the state conviction at\nissue was based on a state statute that encompasses both a substantial\nnumber of cases that qualify under the federal standard and a substan-\ntial number that do not. In such situations, it is appropriate to look\nbeyond the elements of the state offense and to rely as well on facts\nthat were admitted in state court or that, taking a realistic view, were\nclearly proved\u201d). But there are several decades of water over that dam,\nand the dissent offers no newly persuasive reasons for revisiting our\nprecedents.\n12              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning with each of the rationales supporting the categorical\napproach and threatening to undo all its benefits.\n                               A\n   This Court offered three grounds for establishing our\nelements-centric, \u201cformal categorical approach.\u201d Taylor,\n495 U. S., at 600. First, it comports with ACCA\u2019s text and\nhistory. Second, it avoids the Sixth Amendment concerns\nthat would arise from sentencing courts\u2019 making findings\nof fact that properly belong to juries. And third, it averts\n\u201cthe practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a\nfactual approach.\u201d Id., at 601. When assessed in light of\nthose three reasons, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling strikes out\nswinging.\n   Start with the statutory text and history. As we have\nlong recognized, ACCA increases the sentence of a defend-\nant who has three \u201cprevious convictions\u201d for a violent\nfelony\u2014not a defendant who has thrice committed such a\ncrime. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(1); see Taylor, 495 U. S., at 600.\nThat language shows, as Taylor explained, that \u201cCongress\nintended the sentencing court to look only to the fact that\nthe defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within\ncertain categories, and not to the facts underlying the\nprior convictions.\u201d Ibid.; see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 19. If\nCongress had wanted to increase a sentence based on the\nfacts of a prior offense, it presumably would have said so;\nother statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.\nSee Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 36 (construing an immigration\nstatute as requiring a \u201c \u2018circumstance-specific,\u2019 not a \u2018cate-\ngorical,\u2019 \u201d approach). But in ACCA, Taylor found, Congress\nmade a deliberate decision to treat every conviction of a\ncrime in the same manner: During the lengthy debate\npreceding the statute\u2019s enactment, \u201cno one suggested that\na particular crime might sometimes count towards en-\nhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of\nthe case.\u201d 495 U. S., at 601. Congress instead meant\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             13\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nACCA to function as an on-off switch, directing that a\nprior crime would qualify as a predicate offense in all\ncases or in none.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach runs headlong into that\ncongressional choice. Instead of reviewing documents like\nan indictment or plea colloquy only to determine \u201cwhich\nstatutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,\u201d the\nNinth Circuit looks to those materials to discover what the\ndefendant actually did. Johnson, 559 U. S., at 144. This\ncase demonstrates the point. Descamps was not convicted\nof generic burglary, because (as the Government agrees)\n\u00a7459 does not contain that crime\u2019s required unlawful-entry\nelement. See Brief for United States 38, 43\u201344. At most,\nthe colloquy showed that Descamps committed generic\nburglary, and so hypothetically could have been convicted\nunder a law criminalizing that conduct. But that is just\nwhat we said, in Taylor and elsewhere, is not enough. See\n495 U. S., at 600; Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U. S.\n___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 11) (rejecting such a \u201c \u2018 hypothet-\nical approach\u2019 \u201d given a similar statute\u2019s directive to \u201clook\nto the conviction itself,\u201d rather than \u201cto what might have\nor could have been charged\u201d). And the necessary result of\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s method is exactly the differential\ntreatment we thought Congress, in enacting ACCA, took\ncare to prevent. In the two years since Aguila-Montes, the\nNinth Circuit has treated some, but not other, convictions\nunder \u00a7459 as ACCA predicates, based on minor varia-\ntions in the cases\u2019 plea documents. Compare, e.g., 466\nFed. Appx., at 565 (Descamps\u2019 \u00a7459 conviction counts as\ngeneric burglary), with 655 F. 3d, at 946 (Aguila-Montes\u2019\ndoes not).\n   Similarly, consider (though Aguila-Montes did not) the\ncategorical approach\u2019s Sixth Amendment underpinnings.\nWe have held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior convic-\ntion, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond\nthe prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n14              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Under ACCA, the\ncourt\u2019s finding of a predicate offense indisputably increases\nthe maximum penalty. Accordingly, that finding would\n(at the least) raise serious Sixth Amendment concerns if it\nwent beyond merely identifying a prior conviction. Those\nconcerns, we recognized in Shepard, counsel against allow-\ning a sentencing court to \u201cmake a disputed\u201d determination\n\u201cabout what the defendant and state judge must have\nunderstood as the factual basis of the prior plea,\u201d or what\nthe jury in a prior trial must have accepted as the theory\nof the crime. 544 U. S., at 25 (plurality opinion); see id., at\n28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (stating that such a finding would \u201cgiv[e] rise to\nconstitutional error, not doubt\u201d). Hence our insistence on\nthe categorical approach.\n   Yet again, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling flouts our reasoning\u2014\nhere, by extending judicial factfinding beyond the recog-\nnition of a prior conviction. Our modified categorical\napproach merely assists the sentencing court in identify-\ning the defendant\u2019s crime of conviction, as we have held\nthe Sixth Amendment permits. But the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nreworking authorizes the court to try to discern what a\ntrial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the\ndefendant\u2019s underlying conduct. See Aguila-Montes, 655\nF. 3d, at 937. And there\u2019s the constitutional rub. The\nSixth Amendment contemplates that a jury\u2014not a sen-\ntencing court\u2014will find such facts, unanimously and\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. And the only facts the court\ncan be sure the jury so found are those constituting ele-\nments of the offense\u2014as distinct from amplifying but\nlegally extraneous circumstances. See, e.g., Richardson v.\nUnited States, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999). Similarly, as\nShepard indicated, when a defendant pleads guilty to a\ncrime, he waives his right to a jury determination of only\nthat offense\u2019s elements; whatever he says, or fails to say,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nabout superfluous facts cannot license a later sentencing\ncourt to impose extra punishment. See 544 U. S., at 24\u201326\n(plurality opinion). So when the District Court here en-\nhanced Descamps\u2019 sentence, based on his supposed acqui-\nescence to a prosecutorial statement (that he \u201cbroke and\nentered\u201d) irrelevant to the crime charged, the court did\njust what we have said it cannot: rely on its own finding\nabout a non-elemental fact to increase a defendant\u2019s max-\nimum sentence.\n   Finally, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision creates the same\n\u201cdaunting\u201d difficulties and inequities that first encouraged\nus to adopt the categorical approach. Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n601\u2013602. In case after case, sentencing courts following\nAguila-Montes would have to expend resources examining\n(often aged) documents for evidence that a defendant\nadmitted in a plea colloquy, or a prosecutor showed at\ntrial, facts that, although unnecessary to the crime of\nconviction, satisfy an element of the relevant generic\noffense. The meaning of those documents will often be\nuncertain. And the statements of fact in them may be\ndownright wrong. A defendant, after all, often has little\nincentive to contest facts that are not elements of the\ncharged offense\u2014and may have good reason not to. At\ntrial, extraneous facts and arguments may confuse the\njury. (Indeed, the court may prohibit them for that rea-\nson.) And during plea hearings, the defendant may not\nwish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling about\nsuperfluous factual allegations. In this case, for example,\nDescamps may have let the prosecutor\u2019s statement go by\nbecause it was irrelevant to the proceedings. He likely\nwas not thinking about the possibility that his silence\ncould come back to haunt him in an ACCA sentencing 30\nyears in the future. (Actually, he could not have been\nthinking that thought: ACCA was not even on the books at\nthe time of Descamps\u2019 burglary conviction.)\n   Still worse, the Aguila-Montes approach will deprive\n16              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsome defendants of the benefits of their negotiated plea\ndeals. Assume (as happens every day) that a defendant\nsurrenders his right to trial in exchange for the govern-\nment\u2019s agreement that he plead guilty to a less serious\ncrime, whose elements do not match an ACCA offense.\nUnder the Ninth Circuit\u2019s view, a later sentencing court\ncould still treat the defendant as though he had pleaded to\nan ACCA predicate, based on legally extraneous state-\nments found in the old record. Taylor recognized the\nproblem: \u201c[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense\nwas the result of a plea bargain,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cit\nwould seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if\nthe defendant had pleaded guilty\u201d to generic burglary.\n495 U. S., at 601\u2013602. That way of proceeding, on top of\neverything else, would allow a later sentencing court to\nrewrite the parties\u2019 bargain.\n                             B\n   The Ninth Circuit defended its (excessively) modified\napproach by denying any real distinction between divisible\nand indivisible statutes extending further than the generic\noffense. \u201cThe only conceptual difference,\u201d the court rea-\nsoned, \u201cis that [a divisible statute] creates an explicitly\nfinite list of possible means of commission, while [an\nindivisible one] creates an implied list of every means of\ncommission that otherwise fits the definition of a given\ncrime.\u201d Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927. For example,\nan indivisible statute \u201crequir[ing] use of a \u2018weapon\u2019 is not\nmeaningfully different\u201d\u2014or so says the Ninth Circuit\u2014\n\u201cfrom a statute that simply lists every kind of weapon in\nexistence . . . (\u2018gun, axe, sword, baton, slingshot, knife,\nmachete, bat,\u2019 and so on).\u201d Ibid. In a similar way, every\nindivisible statute can be imaginatively reconstructed as a\ndivisible one. And if that is true, the Ninth Circuit asks,\nwhy limit the modified categorical approach only to explic-\nitly divisible statutes?\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The simple answer is: Because only divisible statutes\nenable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury (or judge\nat a plea hearing) has convicted the defendant of every\nelement of the generic crime. A prosecutor charging a\nviolation of a divisible statute must generally select the\nrelevant element from its list of alternatives. See, e.g.,\nThe Confiscation Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1874) (\u201c[A]n\nindictment or a criminal information which charges the\nperson accused, in the disjunctive, with being guilty of one\nor of another of several offences, would be destitute of the\nnecessary certainty, and would be wholly insufficient\u201d).4\nAnd the jury, as instructions in the case will make clear,\nmust then find that element, unanimously and beyond a\nreasonable doubt. So assume, along the lines of the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s example, that a statute criminalizes assault with\nany of eight specified weapons; and suppose further, as the\nNinth Circuit did, that only assault with a gun counts as\nan ACCA offense. A later sentencing court need only\ncheck the charging documents and instructions (\u201cDo they\nrefer to a gun or something else?\u201d) to determine whether\nin convicting a defendant under that divisible statute, the\njury necessarily found that he committed the ACCA-\nqualifying crime.\n  None of that is true of an overbroad, indivisible stat-\nute. A sentencing court, to be sure, can hypothetically\nreconceive such a statute in divisible terms.

Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a719.3(a), p. 263\n(3d ed. 2007) (\u201c[W]here a statute specifies several different ways in\nwhich the crime can be committed, [courts often] hold that the pleading\nmust refer to the particular alternative presented in the individual\ncase\u201d).\n18              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimagination could devise a laundry list of potential\n\u201cweapons\u201d\u2014not just the eight the Ninth Circuit mentioned,\nbut also (for starters) grenades, pipe bombs, spears, tire\nirons, BB guns, nunchucks, and crossbows. But the thing\nabout hypothetical lists is that they are, well, hypothetical.\nAs long as the statute itself requires only an indeterminate\n\u201cweapon,\u201d that is all the indictment must (or is likely to)\nallege and all the jury instructions must (or are likely to)\nmention. And most important, that is all the jury must\nfind to convict the defendant. The jurors need not all\nagree on whether the defendant used a gun or a knife or a\ntire iron (or any other particular weapon that might ap-\npear in an imagined divisible statute), because the actual\nstatute requires the jury to find only a \u201cweapon.\u201d And\neven if in many cases, the jury could have readily reached\nconsensus on the weapon used, a later sentencing court\ncannot supply that missing judgment. Whatever the un-\nderlying facts or the evidence presented, the defendant\nstill would not have been convicted, in the deliberate and\nconsidered way the Constitution guarantees, of an offense\nwith the same (or narrower) elements as the supposed\ngeneric crime (assault with a gun).\n   Indeed, accepting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s contrary reasoning\nwould altogether collapse the distinction between a cate-\ngorical and a fact-specific approach. After all, the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s \u201cweapons\u201d example is just the tip of the iceberg:\nCourts can go much further in reconceiving indivisible\nstatutes as impliedly divisible ones. In fact, every element\nof every statute can be imaginatively transformed as the\nNinth Circuit suggests\u2014so that every crime is seen as\ncontaining an infinite number of sub-crimes corresponding\nto \u201call the possible ways an individual can commit\u201d it.\nAguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927.

They may not,\nby pretending that every fact pattern is an \u201cimplied\u201d\nstatutory definition, Aguila-Montes, 655 F. 3d, at 927,\nconvert that approach into its opposite.\n                             IV\n  The Government tries to distance itself from the Ninth\nCircuit by offering a purportedly narrower theory\u2014that\nalthough an indivisible statute that is \u201ctruly missing\u201d an\nelement of the generic offense cannot give rise to an ACCA\nconviction, California\u2019s burglary law can do so because it\nmerely \u201ccontains a broader version of the [generic] ele-\nment of unlawfulness of entry.\u201d Brief for United States\n11\u201312. The Government\u2019s argument proceeds in three\nsteps. It begins from the premise that sentencing courts\napplying ACCA should consider not only the statute defin-\ning a prior crime but also any judicial interpretations of it.\nNext, the Government points to a California decision\nholding (not surprisingly) that a defendant cannot \u201cbur-\nglariz[e] his own home\u201d; the case\u2019s reasoning, the Govern-\nment notes, is that \u00a7459 (though not saying so explicitly)\nrequires \u201can entry which invades a possessory right.\u201d\nPeople v. Gauze, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1161290\"><a href=\"/cal/6Xdf/people-v-gauze/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713\u2013716, 542 P. 2d 1365,\n1367\u20131368 (1975). Given that precedent, the Government\ncontends, \u00a7459 includes a kind of \u201cunlawful entry\u201d ele-\n20                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nment, although it is broader than the generic crime\u2019s\nanalogous requirement. Finally, the Government asserts\nthat sentencing courts may use the modified approach \u201cto\ndetermine whether a particular defendant\u2019s conviction\nunder\u201d such an overbroad statute actually \u201cwas for [the]\ngeneric\u201d crime. Brief for United States 11.\n  Although elaborately developed in the Government\u2019s\nbrief, this argument\u2019s first two steps turn out to be side-\nshows. We may reserve the question whether, in deter-\nmining a crime\u2019s elements, a sentencing court should take\naccount not only of the relevant statute\u2019s text, but of judi-\ncial rulings interpreting it. And we may assume, as the\nGovernment insists, that California caselaw treats \u00a7459 as\nincluding an element of entry \u201cinvading a possessory\nright\u201d\u2014although, truth be told, we find the state decisions\non that score contradictory and confusing.5 Even on those\nassumptions, \u00a7459\u2019s elements do not come into line with\ngeneric burglary\u2019s. As the Government concedes, almost\nevery entry onto another\u2019s property with intent to steal\u2014\nincluding, for example, a shoplifter\u2019s walking into an open\nstore\u2014\u201cinvades a possessory right\u201d under \u00a7459. See Brief\nfor United States 38; Gauze, 15 Cal. 3d, at 714, 542 P. 2d,\nat 1367. By contrast, generic burglary\u2019s unlawful-entry\nelement excludes any case in which a person enters prem-\nises open to the public, no matter his intent; the generic\ncrime requires breaking and entering or similar unlawful\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Several decisions treat \u201cinvasion of a possessory right\u201d as an aspect\nof \u00a7459\u2019s entry element, see, e.g., People v.

See Brief for United States 38; LaFave \u00a721.1(a).\nSo everything rests on the Government\u2019s third point: that\nthis mismatch does not preclude applying the modified\ncategorical approach, because it results not from a missing\nelement but instead from an element\u2019s overbreadth.\n   But for starters, we see no principled way to make that\ndistinction. Most overbroad statutes can also be charac-\nterized as missing an element; and most statutes missing\nan element can also be labeled overbroad. Here is the only\nconclusion in Aguila-Montes we agree with: \u201c[I]t is diffi-\ncult, if not impossible\u201d to determine which is which. 655\nF. 3d, at 925. The example that court gave was as follows:\nA statute of conviction punishes possession of pornogra-\nphy, but a federal law carries a sentence enhancement for\npossession of child pornography. Is the statute of convic-\ntion overbroad because it includes both adult and child\npornography; or is that law instead missing the element of\ninvolvement of minors? The same name game can be\nplayed with \u00a7459. The Government labors mightily to\nturn what it fears looks like a missing-element statute\ninto an overbroad statute through the incorporation of\njudicial decisions. But even putting those decisions aside,\nthe Government might have described \u00a7459 as merely\nhaving an overbroad element because \u201centry\u201d includes\nboth the lawful and the unlawful kind. And conversely,\nDescamps could claim that even as judicially inter-\npreted, \u00a7459 is entirely missing generic burglary\u2019s ele-\nment of breaking and entering or similar unlawful conduct.\nAll is in the eye of the beholder, and prone to endless\nmanipulation.\n   In any event, and more fundamentally, we see no reason\nwhy the Government\u2019s distinction should matter. Whether\nthe statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing\nelement, the problem is the same: Because of the mis-\nmatch in elements, a person convicted under that statute\nis never convicted of the generic crime. In this case, for\n22                DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nexample, Descamps was not convicted of generic burglary\nbecause \u00a7459, whether viewed as missing an element or\ncontaining an overbroad one, does not require breaking\nand entering. So every reason we have given\u2014textual,\nconstitutional, and practical\u2014for rejecting the Ninth\nCircuit\u2019s proposed approach applies to the Government\u2019s\nas well. See supra, at 12\u201316. At bottom, the Government\nwants the same thing as the Ninth Circuit (if nominally in\na few fewer cases): It too wishes a sentencing court to look\nbeyond the elements to the evidence or, otherwise said, to\nexplore whether a person convicted of one crime could also\nhave been convicted of another, more serious offense. But\nthat circumstance-specific review is just what the categor-\nical approach precludes. And as we have explained, we\nadopted the modified approach to help implement the\ncategorical inquiry, not to undermine it.\n                            V\n   Descamps may (or may not) have broken and entered,\nand so committed generic burglary. But \u00a7459\u2014the crime\nof which he was convicted\u2014does not require the factfinder\n(whether jury or judge) to make that determination.\nBecause generic unlawful entry is not an element, or an\nalternative element, of \u00a7459, a conviction under that\nstatute is never for generic burglary. And that decides\nthis case in Descamps\u2019 favor; the District Court should not\nhave enhanced his sentence under ACCA.6 That court and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The Government here forfeited an alternative argument that \u00a7459\n\nqualifies as a predicate offense under ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause,\u201d which\ncovers statutes \u201cinvolv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We\nexpress no view on that argument\u2019s merits. Compare United States v.\nMayer, 560 F. 3d 948, 960\u2013963 (CA9 2009) (holding that Oregon\u2019s\nburglary statute falls within the residual clause, even though it does\nnot include all of generic burglary\u2019s elements), with id., at 951\n(Kozinski, C.

The modified approach does not authorize\na sentencing court to substitute such a facts-based inquiry\nfor an elements-based one. A court may use the modified\napproach only to determine which alternative element in a\ndivisible statute formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s con-\nviction.

Aguila-Montes de\nOca, 655 F. 3d 915 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (per curiam);\nUnited States v. Beardsley, 691 F. 3d 252 (CA2 2012).\nThis category is used to describe a class of criminal stat-\nutes that are drafted with a single set of elements that are\nbroader than those of the generic definition of the corre-\nsponding crime enumerated in the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n   Just one of the substantial concerns that the Court\nis correct to consider is that, in the regular course of the\ncriminal process, convictions may be entered, often by\nguilty pleas, when either the attorney or the client, or\nboth, have given no consideration to possible later conse-\nquences under ACCA. See ante, at 15\u201316. As a result,\ncertain facts in the documents approved for judicial exam-\nination in Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005),\nmay go uncontested because they do not alter the sentenc-\ning consequences of the crime, even though their effect is\nto require a later enhancement under ACCA. This signifi-\ncant risk of failing to consider the full consequences of the\nplea and conviction is troubling.\n2              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., concurring\n\n   Balanced against this, as JUSTICE ALITO indicates, is\nthat the dichotomy between divisible and indivisible state\ncriminal statutes is not all that clear. See post, at 12\u201313\n(dissenting opinion). The effect of today\u2019s decision, more-\nover, is that an unspecified number, but likely a large\nnumber, of state criminal statutes that are indivisible but\nthat often do reach serious crimes otherwise subject to\nACCA\u2019s provisions, now must be amended by state legisla-\ntures. Otherwise, they will not meet federal requirements\neven though they would have come within ACCA\u2019s terms\nhad the state statute been drafted in a different way. This\nis an intrusive demand on the States.\n   On due consideration, the concerns well expressed by\nthe Court persuade me that it reaches the correct result.\nThe disruption to the federal policy underlying ACCA,\nnevertheless, is troubling and substantial. See post, at 13\u2013\n14 (ALITO, J., dissenting). If Congress wishes to pursue\nits policy in a proper and efficient way without mandat-\ning uniformity among the States with respect to their\ncriminal statutes for scores of serious offenses, and with-\nout requiring the amendment of any number of federal\ncriminal statutes as well, Congress should act at once. It\nmay then determine whether ACCA\u2019s design and structure\nshould be modified to meet the concerns expressed both by\nthe Court and the dissenting opinion.\n   With these observations, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S. C. \u00a7922(g), which\nsubjected him to a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 impris-\nonment. The District Court, however, applied an Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement with a manda-\ntory minimum of 15 years based in part on Descamps\u2019\nearlier California conviction for burglary. See \u00a7924(e).\nThe California law says that any \u201cperson who enters\u201d any\nof a number of structures \u201cwith intent to commit grand or\npetit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d Califor-\nnia Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West 2010). That law does\nnot, on its face, require the jury to determine whether the\nentry itself was unlawful, a required element of the so-\ncalled \u201cgeneric\u201d offense of burglary that qualifies as an\nACCA predicate. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S.\n575, 599 (1990). The majority holds that a court may not\nreview the underlying facts of Descamps\u2019 state crime to\ndetermine whether he entered the building unlawfully\nand, thus, that his burglary conviction may not be used as\na predicate offense under ACCA. While I agree with the\nCourt\u2019s conclusion, I disagree with its reasoning.\n   I have previously explained that ACCA runs afoul of\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), because it\nallows the judge to \u201cmak[e] a finding that raises [a de-\n2               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n               THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment\n\nfendant\u2019s] sentence beyond the sentence that could have\nlawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by\nthe jury or admitted by the defendant.\u201d James v. United\nStates, 550 U. S. 192, 231 (2007) (dissenting opinion)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under the logic of\nApprendi, a court may not find facts about a prior convic-\ntion when such findings increase the statutory maximum.\nThis is so whether a court is determining whether a\nprior conviction was entered, see 530 U. S., at 520\u2013521\n(THOMAS, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what\nfacts were necessary to a prior conviction. See James, su-\npra, at 231\u2013232 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). In either case,\nthe court is inappropriately finding a fact that must be\nsubmitted to the jury because it \u201cincreases the penalty for\na crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.\u201d\nApprendi, supra, at 490.\n   In light of the foregoing, it does not matter whether a\nstatute is \u201cdivisible\u201d or \u201cindivisible,\u201d see ante, at 1\u20132, and\ncourts should not have to struggle with the contours of\nthe so-called \u201cmodified categorical\u201d approach. Ibid. The\nonly reason Descamps\u2019 ACCA enhancement is before us is\n\u201cbecause this Court has not yet reconsidered Almendarez-\nTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), which draws\nan exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial\nfactfinding that concerns a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\u201d\nShepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 27 (2005)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg-\nment). Regardless of the framework adopted, judicial\nfactfinding increases the statutory maximum in violation\nof the Sixth Amendment. However, because today\u2019s opin-\nion at least limits the situations in which courts make\nfactual determinations about prior convictions, I concur in\nthe judgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S. C. \u00a7924(c). This is so, according to the Court,\nbecause (1) burglary under California law is broader than\nso-called \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d\u2014unlawfully entering or re-\nmaining in a building with the intent to commit a crime;\n(2) the California burglary statute is not \u201cdivisible\u201d; and\n(3) our \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d cannot be used in a\ncase involving an indivisible statute. Even when it is\napparent that a California burglary conviction was based\non what everyone imagines when the term \u201cburglary\u201d is\nmentioned\u2014e.g., breaking into a home to steal valuables\u2014\nthat conviction, the Court holds, must be ignored.\n  I would give ACCA a more practical reading. When it is\nclear that a defendant necessarily admitted or the jury\nnecessarily found that the defendant committed the ele-\nments of generic burglary, the conviction should qualify.\nPetitioner\u2019s burglary conviction meets that requirement,\nand I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                            I\n  Before petitioner was charged in the case now before us,\n2               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nhe had already compiled a criminal record that included\nconvictions in Washington State for assault and threaten-\ning to kill a judge, and convictions in California for rob-\nbery and burglary. See App. 11a\u201312a; 466 Fed. Appx. 563,\n565 (CA9 2012). After his release from custody for these\nearlier crimes, petitioner fired a gun in the direction of a\nman who supposedly owed him money for methampheta-\nmine, and as a result, he was charged in federal court with\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of\n\u00a7922(g)(1). A jury found him guilty, and the District Court\nimposed an enhanced sentence under ACCA because he\nhad the requisite number of previous convictions for \u201ca\nviolent felony or a serious drug offense.\u201d \u00a7924(e). ACCA\ndefines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include a \u201cburglary\u201d that is\n\u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\nyear,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), and both the District Court and the\nCourt of Appeals found that petitioner\u2019s California bur-\nglary conviction fit this definition.\n   While the concept of a conviction for burglary might\nseem simple, things have not worked out that way under\nour case law. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575,\n599 (1990), we held that \u201cburglary\u201d under ACCA means\nwhat we called \u201cgeneric burglary,\u201d that is, the \u201cunlawful or\nunprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or\nstructure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d Determining\nwhether a burglary conviction qualifies under this defini-\ntion is easy if the elements set out in the state statute are\nthe same as or narrower than the elements of generic\nburglary, see ibid., but what if the state offense is broader?\nIn that event, we have held, a federal court may sometimes\napply what we have termed the \u201cmodified categorical\napproach,\u201d that is, it may examine some items in the\nstate-court record, including charging documents, jury\ninstructions, and statements made at guilty plea proceed-\nings, to determine if the defendant was actually found to\nhave committed the elements of the generic offense.

S. 13, 20 (2005); Taylor,\nsupra, at 602.\n   Petitioner argues that his 1978 conviction for burglary\nunder California Penal Code \u00a7459 does not qualify as a\nburglary conviction for ACCA purposes because of the\nparticular way in which this provision is worded. Section\n459 provides that a \u201cperson who enters\u201d certain locations\n\u201cwith intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony\nis guilty of burglary.\u201d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7459 (West\n2010). This provision is broader than generic burglary in\ntwo respects.\n   The first, which does not preclude application of the\nmodified categorical approach, concerns the place burglar-\nized. While generic burglary applies only to offenses\ninvolving the entry of a building, the California provision\nalso reaches offenses involving the entry of some other\nlocations, see ibid. Under our cases, however, a federal\ncourt considering whether to apply ACCA may determine,\nbased on an examination of certain relevant documents,\nwhether the conviction was actually based on the entry of\na building and, if it was, may impose an increased sen-\ntence. See Johnson v. United States, 559 U. S. 133, 144\n(2010); Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 35 (2009); Shep-\nard, supra, at 26.\n   The second variation is more consequential. Whereas\ngeneric burglary requires an entry that is unlawful or\nunprivileged, the California statute refers without qualifi-\ncation to \u201c[e]very person who enters.\u201d \u00a7459. Petitioner\nargues, and the Court agrees, that this discrepancy ren-\nders the modified categorical approach inapplicable to his\nCalifornia burglary conviction.\n                            II\n  The Court holds that \u201csentencing courts may not apply\nthe modified categorical approach when the crime of which\nthe defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of\n4               DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nelements.\u201d Ante, at 2. Because the Court\u2019s holding is\nbased on the distinction between \u201cdivisible\u201d and \u201cindivisi-\nble\u201d statutes, it is important to identify precisely what this\ntaxonomy means.\n   My understanding is that a statute is divisible, in the\nsense used by the Court, only if the offense in question\nincludes as separate elements all of the elements of the\ngeneric offense. By an element, I understand the Court to\nmean something on which a jury must agree by the vote\nrequired to convict under the law of the applicable juris-\ndiction. See ante, at 14 (citing Richardson v. United\nStates, 526 U. S. 813, 817 (1999)). And although the Court\nreserves decision on the question whether a sentencing\ncourt may take authoritative judicial decisions into ac-\ncount in identifying the elements of a statute, see ante, at\n20, I will assume that a sentencing court may do so. While\nthe elements of a criminal offense are generally set out in\nthe statutory text, courts sometimes find that unmen-\ntioned elements are implicit. See, e.g., Neder v. United\nStates, 527 U. S. 1, 20 (1999) (holding that federal mail\nfraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes require proof of\nmateriality even though that element is not mentioned in\nthe statutory text). I cannot think of any reason why an\nauthoritative decision of this sort should be ignored, and\nthe Court has certainly not provided any. I therefore\nproceed on the assumption that a statute is divisible if the\noffense, as properly construed, has the requisite elements.\n   The Court\u2019s holding that the modified categorical ap-\nproach may be used only when a statute is divisible in this\nsense is not required by ACCA or by our prior cases and\nwill cause serious practical problems.\n                          A\n  Nothing in the text of ACCA mandates the Court\u2019s\nexclusive focus on the elements of an offense.

C.\n\u00a7924(e)(1) (emphasis added), and the Court claims that the\nword \u201cconvictions\u201d mandates a narrow, elements-based\ninquiry, see ante, at 12. But \u201c[i]n ordinary speech, when it\nis said that a person was convicted of or for doing some-\nthing, the \u2018something\u2019 may include facts that go beyond\nthe bare elements of the relevant criminal offense.\u201d\nMoncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting) (slip op., at 10\u201311).\n   Nor is an exclusively elements-based inquiry mandated\nby ACCA\u2019s definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime . . .\nthat . . . is burglary,\u201d \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii). In drafting that\nprovision, Congress did not say \u201cany crime that has the\nelements of burglary.\u201d Indeed, the fact that Congress\nreferred to \u201celements\u201d elsewhere in the same subpara-\ngraph, see \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (defining \u201cviolent felony\u201d to\nmean any crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the\nperson of another\u201d (emphasis added)), but omitted any\nreference to elements from \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) suggests, if\nanything, that it did not intend to focus exclusively on\nelements. Cf. Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v.\nNovo Nordisk A/S, 566 U.

In at least three of those cases, the\nCourt thought that the modified categorical approach could\nbe used in relation to statutes that may not have been\ndivisible.\n   Shepard concerned prior convictions under two Massa-\nchusetts burglary statutes that applied not only to the\nentry of a \u201cbuilding\u201d (as is the case with generic burglary)\n6              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nbut also to the entry of a \u201cship, vessel, or vehicle.\u201d Mass.\nGen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, \u00a716 (West 2000). See also \u00a718;\n544 U. S., at 17. And the Shepard Court did not think\nthat this feature of the Massachusetts statutes precluded\nthe application of the modified categorical approach. See\nid., at 25\u201326; ante, at 6\u20137. See also Nijhawan, 557 U. S.,\nat 35 (discussing Shepard).\n   In today\u2019s decision, the Court assumes that \u201cbuilding\u201d\nand the other locations enumerated in the Massachusetts\nstatutes, such as \u201cvessel,\u201d were alternative elements, but\nthat is questionable. It is quite likely that the entry of a\nbuilding and the entry of a vessel were simply alternative\nmeans of satisfying an element. See Commonwealth v.\nCabrera, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827, 874 N. E. 2d 654, 657 (2007)\n(\u201cThe elements of breaking and entering in the nighttime\nwith intent to commit a felony are (1) breaking and (2)\nentering a building, ship, vessel or vehicle belonging\nto another (3) at night, (4) with the intent to commit a\nfelony\u201d). \u201c[L]egislatures frequently enumerate alternative\nmeans of committing a crime without intending to define\nseparate elements or separate crimes.\u201d Schad v. Arizona,\n501 U. S. 624, 636 (1991) (plurality). The feature that\ndistinguishes elements and means is the need for juror\nagreement, see Richardson, supra, at 817, and therefore in\ndetermining whether the entry of a building and the entry\nof a vessel are elements or means, the critical question is\nwhether a jury would have to agree on the nature of the\nplace that a defendant entered.\n   A case that we decided earlier this Term illustrates why\n\u201cbuilding\u201d and \u201cvessel\u201d may have been means and not\nseparate elements. In Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 568 U.

Compare id., at ___ (slip op. at 1),\nwith id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissent-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Suppose that a defendant in Massachusetts was\ncharged with breaking into a structure like the Lozman\nfloating home. In order to convict, would it be necessary\nfor the jury to agree whether this structure was a \u201cbuild-\ning\u201d or a \u201cvessel\u201d? If some jurors insisted it was a building\nand others were convinced it was a vessel, would the jury\nbe hung? The Court\u2019s answer is \u201cyes.\u201d According to the\nCourt, if a defendant had been charged with burglarizing\nthe Lozman floating home and this Court had been sitting\nas the jury, the defendant would have escaped conviction\nfor burglary, no matter how strong the evidence, because\nthe \u201cjury\u201d could not agree on whether he burglarized a\nbuilding or a vessel.\n   I have not found a Massachusetts decision squarely on\npoint, but there is surely an argument that the Massachu-\nsetts Legislature did not want to demand juror agreement\non this question. In other words, there is a strong argu-\nment that entry of a \u201cbuilding\u201d and entry of a \u201cvessel\u201d are\nmerely alternative means, not alternative elements. And\nif that is so, the reasoning in Shepard undermines the\nCourt\u2019s argument that the modified categorical approach\nfocuses solely on elements and not on conduct.\n   Johnson, like Shepard, involved a statute that may have\nset out alternative means, rather than alternative ele-\nments. Under the Florida statute involved in that case, a\nbattery occurs when a person either \u201c1. [a]ctually and\nintentionally touches or strikes another person against the\nwill of the other; or 2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm\nto another person.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7784.03(1)(a) (2010). It is a\ndistinct possibility (one not foreclosed by any Florida\ndecision of which I am aware) that a conviction under this\nprovision does not require juror agreement as to whether a\ndefendant firmly touched or lightly struck the victim.\nNevertheless, in Johnson, we had no difficulty concluding\n8                  DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthat the modified categorical approach could be applied.1\nSee 559 U. S., at 137.2\n  Far from mandating the Court\u2019s approach, these deci-\nsions support a practical understanding of the modified\ncategorical approach. Thus, in Shepard, we observed that\nthe factual circumstances of a defendant\u2019s prior conviction\nmay be relevant to determining whether it qualifies as a\nviolent felony under ACCA. See 544 U. S., at 20\u201321\n(\u201cWith such material in a pleaded case, a later court could\ngenerally tell whether the plea had \u2018necessarily\u2019 rested on\nthe fact identifying the burglary as generic, just as the\ndetails of instructions could support that conclusion in the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n   1 However, because the Shepard documents did not reveal whether\n\nJohnson had been found to have touched or struck, we had to determine\nwhether the relatively innocuous phrase\u2014\u201c[a]ctually and intentionally\ntouch[ing]\u201d another person\u2014constituted physical force for purposes of\n\u00a7924(e)(2)(B)(i). See Johnson, 559 U. S., at 137.\n   2 The remaining case, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990),\n\nmay also have involved a statute that was not divisible, but the situa-\ntion is less clear. There, the defendant had several Missouri burglary\nconvictions, and Missouri had several different burglary provisions in\neffect at the time in question. See id., at 578, n. 1. The particular\nprovision involved in each of those cases was not certain. Ibid. At least\none of those provisions, however, may not have been divisible. That\nprovision, Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7560.070 (1969) (repealed), applied not only to\nbuildings but also to \u201cany booth or tent,\u201d \u201cany boat or vessel,\u201d or a\n\u201crailroad car.\u201d It is not entirely clear whether a Missouri court would\nhave required jurors to agree on a particular choice from this list. In\nState v. Vandergriff, 403 S. W. 2d 579, 581 (Mo. 1966), the Missouri\nSupreme Court held that an information was deficient because it\n\u201comitted a description of the type of building that might be burglarized\nas defined by \u00a7560.070, and thereby omitted an essential element of the\noffense of burglary in the second degree.\u201d Because an information must\ngenerally include factual details that go beyond the elements of an\noffense, see 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal\nProcedure \u00a719.3(b), p. 276 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave), it is\npossible that the Missouri court did not mean to say that the type of\nbuilding was an element in the sense in which I understand the Court\nto use the term here.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And in Nijhawan, we departed from the\ncategorical approach altogether and instead applied a\n\u201ccircumstance-specific\u201d approach. See 557 U. S., at 36,\n38. If anything, then, Nijhawan undermines the major-\nity\u2019s position that rigid adherence to elements is always\nrequired.\n                             C\n  The Court fears that application of the modified categor-\nical approach to statutes such as \u00a7459 would be unfair to\ndefendants, who \u201coften ha[ve] little incentive to contest\nfacts that are not elements of the charged offense\u201d and\n\u201cmay not wish to irk the prosecutor or court by squabbling\nabout superfluous factual allegations.\u201d Ante, at 15. This\nargument attributes to criminal defendants and their\nattorneys a degree of timidity that may not be realistic.\nBut in any event, even if a defendant does not think it\nworthwhile to \u201csquabbl[e]\u201d about insignificant factual\nallegations, a defendant clearly has an incentive to dispute\nallegations that may have a bearing on his sentence. And\nthat will often be the case when alternative elements or\nmeans suggest different degrees of culpability. Cf. Cal.\n10              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nPenal Code Ann. \u00a7460 (providing that burglary of certain\ninhabited locations enumerated in \u00a7459 is punishable in\nthe first degree, and that burglary of all other locations is\npunishable in the second degree).\n                              D\n  The Court\u2019s approach, I must concede, does have one\nbenefit: It provides an extra measure of assurance that a\nburglary conviction will not be counted as an ACCA predi-\ncate unless the defendant, if he went to trial, was actually\nfound by a jury to have committed the elements of the\ngeneric offense. But this extra bit of assurance will gener-\nally be quite modest at best.\n  To see why this is so, compare what would happen\nunder an indivisible burglary statute that simply requires\nentry invading a possessory right, and a divisible statute\nthat has the following two alternative elements: (1) entry\nby trespass and (2) entry by invitation but with an undis-\nclosed criminal intent. Under the former statute, the jury\nwould be required to agree only that the defendant invaded\na possessory right when entering the place in question,\nand therefore it would be possible for the jury to convict\neven if some jurors thought that the defendant entered by\ntrespassing while others thought that he entered by invi-\ntation but with an undisclosed criminal intent. Under the\nlatter statute, by contrast, the jury would have to agree\neither that he trespassed or that he entered by invitation\nbut with an undisclosed criminal intent.\n  This requirement of unanimity would be of some practi-\ncal value only if the evidence in a case pointed to both\npossibilities, and in a great many cases that will not be so.\nIn cases prosecuted under the California burglary statute,\nI suspect, the evidence generally points either to a tres-\npassory entry, typically involving breaking into a building\nor other covered place, or to an entry by invitation but\nwith an undisclosed criminal intent (in many cases, shop-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            11\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nlifting). Cases in which the evidence suggests that the\ndefendant might have done either are probably not com-\nmon. And in cases where there is evidence supporting\nboth theories, the presence of a divisible statute contain-\ning alternative elements will not solve the problem: A\nguilty verdict will not reveal the alternative on which the\njury agreed unless the jury was asked to return a special\nverdict, something that is not generally favored in crimi-\nnal cases. See 6 LaFave \u00a724.10(a), at 543\u2013544.\n   In cases that end with a guilty plea\u2014and most do\u2014the\nbenefit of divisibility is even less. A judge who accepts a\nguilty plea is typically required to confirm that there is a\nfactual basis for the plea, see 5 id., \u00a721.4(f), at 835\u2013840 (3d\ned. 2007 and Supp. 2011\u20132012), and the proffer of a factual\nbasis will generally focus exclusively on one of the\nalternative elements.\n   The Court nevertheless suggests that the extra modi-\ncum of assurance provided in cases involving divisible\nstatutes is needed to prevent violations of the Sixth\nAmendment jury trial right, ante, at 13\u201315, but I disagree.\nSo long as a judge applying ACCA is determining, not\nwhat the defendant did when the burglary in question was\ncommitted, but what the jury in that case necessarily\nfound or what the defendant, in pleading guilty, necessarily\nadmitted, the jury trial right is not infringed. See\nAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998).\nWhen the modified categorical approach is used to decide\nwhether \u201ca jury was actually required to find all the ele-\nments of [a] generic [offense],\u201d the defendant has already\nenjoyed his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determina-\ntion of those elements. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602.\n                             III\n  While producing very modest benefits at most, the\nCourt\u2019s holding will create several serious problems.\n12                 DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n\n                             A\n\n  Determining whether a statute is divisible will often be\nharder than the Court acknowledges. What I have said\nabout the statutes involved in Shepard and Johnson illus-\ntrates this point. The Court assumes that those statutes\nwere divisible, but as I have explained, it is possible that\nthey were not. See supra, at 5\u20137.\n  To determine whether a statute contains alternative\nelements, as opposed to merely alternative means of satis-\nfying an element, a court called upon to apply ACCA will\nbe required to look beyond the text of the statute, which\nmay be deceptive. Take, for example, Michigan Compiled\nLaws Annotated \u00a7750.82(1) (West 2004), which criminal-\nizes assault with \u201ca gun, revolver, pistol, knife, iron bar,\nclub, brass knuckles, or other dangerous weapon.\u201d The\nCourt seems to assume that a statute like this enumerates\nalternative elements, ante, at 17\u201318, but the Michigan\ncourts have held otherwise. Under Michigan law, the\nelements of \u00a7750.82(1) are \u201c(1) an assault, (2) with a dan-\ngerous weapon, and (3) with the intent to injure or place\nthe victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate\nbattery.\u201d People v.

Although the statute lists nu-\nmerous types of weapons, the particular type of weapon is\nnot itself an element that the prosecution must prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the list of weapons in\nthe statute merely enumerates alternative means of com-\nmitting the crime.3\n  Even if a federal court applying ACCA discovers a state-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The board game Clue, to which the Court refers, see ante, at 18,\n\ndoes not provide sound legal guidance. In that game, it matters whether\nColonel Mustard bashed in the victim\u2019s head with a candlestick,\nwrench, or lead pipe. But in real life, the colonel would almost certainly\nnot escape conviction simply because the jury was unable to agree on\nthe particular type of blunt instrument that he used to commit the\nmurder.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Thus, the mere fact that state law requires a\nparticular fact to be alleged in a charging document does\nnot mean that this fact must be found by a jury or admit-\nted by the defendant.\n  The only way to be sure whether particular items are\nalternative elements or simply alternative means of satis-\nfying an element may be to find cases concerning the\ncorrectness of jury instructions that treat the items one way\nor the other. And such cases may not arise frequently.\nOne of the Court\u2019s reasons for adopting the modified cate-\ngorical approach was to simplify the work of ACCA\ncourts, see Shepard, 544 U. S., at 20; Taylor, 495 U. S., at\n601, but the Court\u2019s holding today will not serve that end.\n                          B\n  The Court\u2019s holding will also frustrate fundamental\n14              DESCAMPS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nACCA objectives. We have repeatedly recognized that\nCongress enacted ACCA to ensure (1) that violent, dan-\ngerous recidivists would be subject to enhanced penalties\nand (2) that those enhanced penalties would be applied\nuniformly, regardless of state-law variations. See, e.g., id.,\nat 587\u2013589. See also id., at 582 (\u201c \u2018[I]n terms of fundamen-\ntal fairness, the Act should ensure, to the extent that it is\nconsistent with the prerogatives of the States in defining\ntheir own offenses, that the same type of conduct is pun-\nishable on the Federal level in all cases\u2019 \u201d (quoting S.

S., at 591 (rejecting\ndisparate results across states based on label given by\nState to a particular crime).\n  The Court\u2019s holding will hamper the achievement of\nthese objectives by artificially limiting ACCA\u2019s reach and\ntreating similar convictions differently based solely on the\nvagaries of state law. Defendants convicted of the ele-\nments of generic burglary in California will not be subject\nto ACCA, but defendants who engage in exactly the same\nbehavior in, say, Virginia, will fall within ACCA\u2019s reach.\nSee Va. Code Ann. \u00a718.2\u201390 (Lexis 2009).\n  I would avoid these problems by applying the modified\ncategorical approach to \u00a7459\u2014and any other similar bur-\nglary statute from another State\u2014and would ask whether\nthe relevant portions of the state record clearly show that\nthe jury necessarily found, or the defendant necessarily\nadmitted, the elements of generic burglary. If the state-\ncourt record is inconclusive, then the conviction should not\ncount.

Neither petitioner nor his\nattorney voiced any objection.4 Ibid. In order to accept\npetitioner\u2019s plea, the trial court was required under Cali-\nfornia law to ensure that the plea had a factual basis, see\nCal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a71192.5 (1978); App. 26a, and we\nmust presume that the plea proceedings were conducted in\na regular manner, see Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29\u201330\n(1992). The unmistakable inference arising from the plea\ntranscript is that the trial judge\u2014quite reasonably\u2014\nunderstood petitioner and his attorney to assent to the\nfactual basis provided by the prosecutor. Both the District\nCourt and the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner\nhad admitted and, as a practical matter, was convicted for\nhaving committed the elements of generic burglary, and\nwe did not agree to review that fact-bound determination,\nsee 567 U. S. ___ (2012) (granting certiorari \u201climited to\nQuestion 1 presented by the petition\u201d).\n   Even if that determination is reviewed, however, the\nlower courts\u2019 conclusion should be sustained. Under the\nCalifornia burglary statute, as interpreted by the State\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The Ninth Circuit has held that a court applying the modified cate-\ngorical approach may rely on a prosecutor\u2019s statement as to the factual\nbasis for a guilty plea when that statement is offered on the record in\nthe defendant\u2019s presence and the defendant does not object. United\nStates v. Hernandez-Hernandez, 431 F. 3d 1212, 1219 (2005). Petitioner\nhas not challenged the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule, and that issue is not\nwithin the scope of the question on which we granted certiorari.\nAccordingly, I would apply it for purposes of this case.\n16                 DESCAMPS v.

Nor would an admission to merely \u201centering\u201d\nthe store have permitted the judge to assess whether\npetitioner entered with the intent to commit a crime;\npetitioner\u2019s admission to \u201cbreaking\u201d was therefore critical\nto that element, as well. Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 236\n(rev. 4th ed. 1968) (\u201cBreaking\u201d denotes the \u201ctearing away\nor removal of any part of a house or of the locks, latches,\nor other fastenings intended to secure it, or otherwise\nexerting force to gain an entrance, with the intent to\ncommit a felony\u201d).\n  We have explained that burglary under \u00a7924(e) means\n\u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a\nbuilding or other structure, with intent to commit a\ncrime.\u201d Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598. Based on petitioner\u2019s\nguilty plea and the Shepard documents, it is clear that\npetitioner necessarily admitted the elements of generic\nburglary. He unlawfully entered a building with the\nintent to commit a crime. Accordingly, I would hold that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority suggests that California law is ambiguous as to this\nrequirement, see ante, at 20, n. 5, but any confusion appears to have\narisen after petitioner\u2019s 1978 conviction and is therefore irrelevant for\npurposes of this case.
