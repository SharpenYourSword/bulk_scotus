UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 11–9335. Argued January 14, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nPetitioner Alleyne was charged, as relevant here, with using or carry-\n  ing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U. S. C.\n  §924(c)(1)(A), which carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence,\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i), that increases to a 7-year minimum “if the firearm is\n  brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum “if the fire-\n  arm is discharged,” §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). In convicting Alleyne, the jury\n  form indicated that he had “[u]sed or carried a firearm during and in\n  relation to a crime of violence,” but not that the firearm was\n  “[b]randished.” When the presentence report recommended a 7-year\n  sentence on the §924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the ver-\n  dict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing be-\n  yond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum\n  sentence based on a sentencing judge’s finding of brandishing would\n  violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The District Court\n  overruled his objection, relying on this Court’s holding in Harris v.\n  United States, 536 U. S. 545, that judicial factfinding that increases\n  the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible under\n  the Sixth Amendment. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that\n  Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by Harris.\nHeld: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. Pp. 10–17.\n457 Fed. Appx. 348, vacated and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV, concluding:\n    1. Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for\n  a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “ele-\n  ment” that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, Harris is\n  overruled. Pp. 10–16.\n2                      ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n           (a) Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, concluded that any\n    “ ‘facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a\n    criminal defendant is exposed’ ” are elements of the crime, id., at 490,\n    and thus the Sixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to\n    have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 484.\n    Apprendi’s principle applies with equal force to facts increasing the\n    mandatory minimum, for a fact triggering a mandatory minimum al-\n    ters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant\n    is exposed. Id., at 490. Because the legally prescribed range is the\n    penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either\n    end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredi-\n    ent of the offense. It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentenc-\n    ing range from the penalty affixed to the crime. The fact that crimi-\n    nal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\n    ranges is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty. It\n    is also impossible to dispute that the facts increasing the legally pre-\n    scribed floor aggravate the punishment, heightening the loss of liber-\n    ty associated with the crime. Defining facts that increase a mandato-\n    ry minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the\n    defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of\n    the indictment, see id., at 478–479, and preserves the jury’s historic\n    role as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants,\n    see United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510–511. In reaching a\n    contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the fact that the 7-year mini-\n    mum sentence could have been imposed with or without a judicial\n    finding of brandishing, because the jury’s finding authorized a sen-\n    tence of five years to life, 536 U. S., at 561, but that fact is beside the\n    point. The essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is\n    an element of the crime. Because the fact of brandishing aggravates\n    the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an\n    element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the\n    jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received\n    had a different range been applicable. There is no basis in principle\n    or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that\n    increase the minimum. Pp. 10–15.\n           (b) This ruling does not mean that any fact that influences judi-\n    cial discretion must be found by a jury. This Court has long recog-\n    nized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfind-\n    ing, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Dillon v. United\n    States, 560 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 15–16.\n        2. Here, the sentencing range supported by the jury’s verdict was\n    five years’ imprisonment to life, but the judge, rather than the jury,\n    found brandishing. This increased the penalty to which Alleyne was\n    subjected and violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Pp. 16–17.\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The Sixth Amendment right to trial “by an impartial jury,” in\nconjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each element\nof a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Gaudin,\n515 U. S., at 510. Several divided opinions of this Court have ad-\ndressed the constitutional status of a “sentencing factor.” In McMil-\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86, the Court held that facts found\nto increase a mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\nthat a judge could find by a preponderance of the evidence. In Ap-\nprendi, however, the Court declined to extend McMillan to a New\nJersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment if\nthe trial judge found that the crime was committed with racial bias,\n530 U. S., at 470, finding that any fact that increased the prescribed\nstatutory maximum sentence must be an “element” of the offense to\nbe found by the jury. Id., at 483, n. 10, 490. Two years later in Har-\nris, the Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the\nmandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence. 536\nU. S., at 557. Pp. 3–6.\n   2. The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an\n“element” of the charged offense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S.\n218, ___. Apprendi’s definition necessarily includes not only facts\nthat increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor. At\ncommon law, the relationship between crime and punishment was\nclear. A sentence was prescribed for each offense, leaving judges\nwith little sentencing discretion. If a fact was by law essential to the\npenalty, it was an element of the offense. There was a well-\nestablished practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to\nthe jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing pun-\nishment. And this understanding was reflected in contemporaneous\ncourt decisions and treatises. Pp. 6–10.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, agreeing that Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.\n545, should be overruled, concluded that he continues to disagree\nwith Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, because it fails to recog-\nnize the law’s traditional distinction between elements of a crime and\nsentencing facts, but finds it highly anomalous to read Apprendi as\ninsisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to im-\npose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing\nfacts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence. Overruling\nHarris and applying Apprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to\nmandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly. Where a\nmaximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who\nwishes to impose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds\n4                    ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the requisite statutory factual predicate. Where a mandatory mini-\n    mum sentence is at issue, Apprendi would mean that the government\n    cannot force a judge who does not wish to impose a higher sentence to\n    do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.\n    Pp. 1–3.\n\n   THOMAS, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the\nopinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV, in\nwhich GINSBURG, BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined, and an\nopinion with respect to Parts II and III–A, in which GINSBURG, SO-\nTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ., joined.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this\nCourt held that judicial factfinding that increases the\nmandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible\nunder the Sixth Amendment. We granted certiorari to\nconsider whether that decision should be overruled. 568\nU. S. ___ (2012).\n  Harris drew a distinction between facts that increase\nthe statutory maximum and facts that increase only the\nmandatory minimum. We conclude that this distinction is\ninconsistent with our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466 (2000), and with the original meaning of the\nSixth Amendment. Any fact that, by law, increases the\npenalty for a crime is an “element” that must be submitted\nto the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See id.,\nat 483, n. 10, 490. Mandatory minimum sentences in-\ncrease the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any\n2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nfact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “ele-\nment” that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly,\nHarris is overruled.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Allen Ryan Alleyne and an accomplice de-\nvised a plan to rob a store manager as he drove the store’s\ndaily deposits to a local bank. By feigning car trouble,\nthey tricked the manager to stop. Alleyne’s accomplice\napproached the manager with a gun and demanded the\nstore’s deposits, which the manager surrendered. Alleyne\nwas later charged with multiple federal offenses, includ-\ning robbery affecting interstate commerce, 18 U. S. C.\n§1951(a), and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a\ncrime of violence, §924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) pro-\nvides, in relevant part, that anyone who “uses or carries a\nfirearm” in relation to a “crime of violence” shall:\n      “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n      “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n      “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”\nThe jury convicted Alleyne. The jury indicated on the\nverdict form that Alleyne had “[u]sed or carried a firearm\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence,” but did not\nindicate a finding that the firearm was “[b]randished.”\nApp. 40.\n  The presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence\non the §924(c) count, which reflected the mandatory min-\nimum sentence for cases in which a firearm has been\n“brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Alleyne objected to this\nrecommendation. He argued that it was clear from the\nverdict form that the jury did not find brandishing beyond\na reasonable doubt and that he was subject only to the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n5-year minimum for “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm.” Al-\nleyne contended that raising his mandatory minimum\nsentence based on a sentencing judge’s finding that he\nbrandished a firearm would violate his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial.\n   The District Court overruled Alleyne’s objection. It\nexplained that, under Harris, brandishing was a sentenc-\ning factor that the court could find by a preponderance of\nevidence without running afoul of the Constitution. It\nfound that the evidence supported a finding of brandish-\ning, and sentenced Alleyne to seven years’ imprisonment\non the §924(c) count. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\nlikewise noting that Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by\nHarris. 457 Fed. Appx. 348 (CA4 2011) (per curiam).\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment provides that those “accused” of\na “crime” have the right to a trial “by an impartial jury.”\nThis right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause,\nrequires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Gaudin, 515\nU. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970). The substance and scope of this right depend upon\nthe proper designation of the facts that are elements of the\ncrime.\n                             A\n  The question of how to define a “crime”—and, thus, how\nto determine what facts must be submitted to the jury—\nhas generated a number of divided opinions from this\nCourt. The principal source of disagreement is the consti-\ntutional status of a special sort of fact known as a “sen-\ntencing factor.” This term was first used in McMillan v.\nPennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86 (1986), to refer to facts that\nare not found by a jury but that can still increase the\ndefendant’s punishment. Following McMillan’s introduc-\n4               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntion of this term, this Court has made a number of efforts\nto delimit its boundaries.\n    McMillan initially invoked the distinction between\n“elements” and “sentencing factors” to reject a constitu-\ntional challenge to Pennsylvania’s Mandatory Minimum\nSentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §9712 (1982). That law\nprovided that anyone convicted of certain felonies would\nbe subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if the judge\nfound, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person\n“ ‘visibly possessed a firearm’ ” in the course of committing\nspecified crimes. 477 U. S., at 81, n. 1. While the Court\nacknowledged that there were constitutional limits to the\nState’s ability to “defin[e] crimes and prescrib[e] penal-\nties,” it found that the Commonwealth had permissi-\nbly defined visible possession as a sentencing factor,\nrather than an element. Id., at 86. In the Court’s view,\nthis allowed the judge, rather than the jury, to find this\nfact by a preponderance of evidence without violating the\nConstitution.\n    McMillan did not address whether legislatures’ freedom\nto define facts as sentencing factors extended to findings\nthat increased the maximum term of imprisonment for an\noffense. We foreshadowed an answer to this question in\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999), but\ndid not resolve the issue until Apprendi. There, we identi-\nfied a concrete limit on the types of facts that legislatures\nmay designate as sentencing factors.\n    In Apprendi, the defendant was sentenced to 12 years’\nimprisonment under a New Jersey statute that increased\nthe maximum term of imprisonment from 10 years to 20\nyears if the trial judge found that the defendant commit-\nted his crime with racial bias. 530 U. S., at 470. In de-\nfending its sentencing scheme, the State of New Jersey\nargued that, under McMillan, the legislature could define\nracial bias as a sentencing factor to be found by the judge.\nWe declined to extend McMillan that far. We explained\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthat there was no “principled basis for treating” a fact\nincreasing the maximum term of imprisonment differently\nthan the facts constituting the base offense. 530 U. S., at\n476. The historic link between crime and punishment,\ninstead, led us to conclude that any fact that increased the\nprescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an “ele-\nment” of the offense to be found by the jury. Id., at 483,\nn. 10, 490. We, thus, found that Apprendi’s sentence\nhad been unconstitutionally enhanced by the judge’s finding\nof racial bias by a preponderance of evidence. Id., at\n491–492.\n                              B\n  While Apprendi only concerned a judicial finding that\nincreased the statutory maximum, the logic of Apprendi\nprompted questions about the continuing vitality, if not\nvalidity, of McMillan’s holding that facts found to increase\nthe mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\nand not elements of the crime. We responded two years\nlater in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, where we\nconsidered the same statutory provision and the same\nquestion before us today.\n  In Harris, the defendant was charged, under §924(c)\n(1)(A), with carrying a firearm in the course of committing\na drug trafficking crime. The mandatory minimum sen-\ntence based on the jury’s verdict alone was five years, but\nthe District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum\nsentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evi-\ndence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm. As\nin this case, Harris challenged his sentence on the ground\nthat the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was uncon-\nstitutional under Apprendi, even though the judge’s find-\ning did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was\nexposed. Harris, supra, at 551.\n  The Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that\nincreased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the\n6                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nmaximum sentence. 536 U. S., at 557. In the Court’s\nview, judicial factfinding that increased the mandatory\nminimum did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. Be-\ncause the jury’s verdict “authorized the judge to impose\nthe minimum with or without the finding,” ibid., the Court\nwas of the view that the factual basis for increasing the\nminimum sentence was not “ ‘essential’ ” to the defendant’s\npunishment. Id., at 560–561 (plurality opinion). Instead,\nit merely limited the judge’s “choices within the author-\nized range.” Id., at 567. From this, the Court drew a\ndistinction between “facts increasing the defendant’s\nminimum sentence and facts extending the sentence be-\nyond the statutory maximum,” id., at 566. The Court\nlimited Apprendi’s holding to instances where the factual\nfinding increases the statutory maximum sentence.\n                          III\n  Alleyne contends that Harris was wrongly decided\nand that it cannot be reconciled with our reasoning in\nApprendi. We agree.\n                              A\n   The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the\nfact constitutes an “element” or “ingredient” of the charged\noffense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. 218, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 5); Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10; J. Archbold,\nPleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 52 (5th Am. ed.\n1846) (hereinafter Archbold). In Apprendi, we held that a\nfact is by definition an element of the offense and must be\nsubmitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above\nwhat is otherwise legally prescribed. 530 U. S., at 483,\nn. 10. While Harris declined to extend this principle to\nfacts increasing mandatory minimum sentences, Appren-\ndi’s definition of “elements” necessarily includes not only\nfacts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Both kinds of facts alter the prescribed range of\nsentences to which a defendant is exposed and do so in a\nmanner that aggravates the punishment. 530 U. S., at\n483, n. 10; Harris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nFacts that increase the mandatory minimum sentence are\ntherefore elements and must be submitted to the jury and\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                              1\n   At common law, the relationship between crime and\npunishment was clear. As discussed in Apprendi, “[t]he\nsubstantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific,”\nmeaning “it prescribed a particular sentence for each\noffense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on\nthe Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987) (quoted in Apprendi, supra, at 479). The system\nleft judges with little sentencing discretion: once the facts\nof the offense were determined by the jury, the “judge was\nmeant simply to impose [the prescribed] sentence.” Lang-\nbein, supra, at 36–37; see also 3 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768) (“THE judgment,\nthough pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their\ndetermination or sentence, but the determination and\nsentence of the law” (emphasis deleted)). This Court has\nrecognized that the same was true, in many instances,\nearly on in this country. United States v. Grayson, 438\nU. S. 41, 45 (1978); see, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The larceny statute established two\nlevels of sentencing based on whether the value of the\nstolen property exceeded $100. Because punishment\nvaried with value, the state high court found that value\nwas an element of the offense:\n    “Our statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the\n    punishment for larceny, with reference to the value of\n    the property stolen; and for this reason, as well as be-\n    cause it is in conformity with long established prac-\n    tice, the court are of [the] opinion that the value of the\n    property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the\n    indictment.” Id., at 137.\nNumerous other contemporaneous court decisions reflect\nthis same understanding.

As one 19th-century commen-\ntator explained:\n    “Where a statute annexes a higher degree of punish-\n    ment to a common-law felony, if committed under\n    particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence,\n    in order to bring the defendant within that higher de-\n    gree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have\n10                  ALLEYNE v.

This rule\n“enabled [the defendant] to determine the species of of-\nfence” with which he was charged “in order that he may\nprepare his defence accordingly . . . and that there may be\nno doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if the\ndefendant be convicted.” Archbold 44 (emphasis added).\nAs the Court noted in Apprendi, “[t]he defendant’s ability\nto predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the\nfelony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of\npunishment with crime.” 530 U.

Apprendi, supra,\nat 490; Harris, 536 U. S., at 575, 582 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning). But for a finding of brandishing, the penalty is five\nyears to life in prison; with a finding of brandishing, the\npenalty becomes seven years to life. Just as the maximum\nof life marks the outer boundary of the range, so seven\nyears marks its floor. And because the legally prescribed\nrange is the penalty affixed to the crime, infra, this page,\nit follows that a fact increasing either end of the range\nproduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of\nthe offense. Apprendi, supra, at 501 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring); see also Bishop §598, at 360–361 (if “a statute pre-\nscribes a particular punishment to be inflicted on those\nwho commit it under special circumstances which it men-\ntions, or with particular aggravations,” then those special\ncircumstances must be specified in the indictment (em-\nphasis added)); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §371, p. 291\n(rev. 7th ed. 1874) (similar).\n   It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing\nrange from the penalty affixed to the crime. See Harris,\nsupra, at 569 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment) (facts increasing the minimum and facts\nincreasing the maximum cannot be distinguished “in\nterms of logic”). Indeed, criminal statutes have long speci-\nfied both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is\nevidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.\nSee, e.g., supra, at 7–8; N. Y. Penal Code §§231–232, p. 70\n(1882) (punishment for first-degree robbery was 10 to 20\nyears’ imprisonment; second-degree robbery was 5 to 15\nyears); Va. Code ch. 192, §§1–2, p. 787 (2d ed. 1860) (arson\ncommitted at night was punishable by 5 to 10 years; arson\ncommitted during the day was 3 to 10 years).

A fact that increases a sen-\ntencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the\noffense.\n   Moreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increas-\ning the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\nHarris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); O’Brien,\n560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 2). Elevating the low-end of a sentenc-\ning range heightens the loss of liberty associated with\nthe crime: the defendant’s “expected punishment has\nincreased as a result of the narrowed range” and “the prose-\ncution is empowered, by invoking the mandatory mini-\nmum, to require the judge to impose a higher punishment\nthan he might wish.” Apprendi, supra, at 522 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring). Why else would Congress link an in-\ncreased mandatory minimum to a particular aggravating\nfact other than to heighten the consequences for that\nbehavior? See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88, 89 (twice noting\nthat a mandatory minimum “ ‘ups the ante’ ” for a criminal\ndefendant); Harris, supra, at 580 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nThis reality demonstrates that the core crime and the fact\ntriggering the mandatory minimum sentence together\nconstitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which\nmust be submitted to the jury.2\n——————\n   2 Juries must find any facts that increase either the statutory maxi-\n\nmum or minimum because the Sixth Amendment applies where a\nfinding of fact both alters the legally prescribed range and does so in a\nway that aggravates the penalty. Importantly, this is distinct from\nfactfinding used to guide judicial discretion in selecting a punishment\n“within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246\n(1949). While such findings of fact may lead judges to select sentences\nthat are more severe than the ones they would have selected without\nthose facts, the Sixth Amendment does not govern that element of\nsentencing.

See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n478–479. It also preserves the historic role of the jury as\nan intermediary between the State and criminal defend-\nants. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 510–511\n(“This right was designed ‘to guard against a spirit of\noppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,’ and ‘was\nfrom very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the\nparent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and\npolitical liberties’ ” (quoting 2 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States §§1779, 1780, pp.\n540–541 (4th ed. 1873))); Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78,\n100 (1970) (“[T]he essential feature of a jury obviously lies\nin [its] interposition between the accused and his ac-\ncuser”); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 155 (1968) (“A\nright to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in\norder to prevent oppression by the Government”).\n   In adopting a contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the\nfact that the 7-year minimum sentence could have been\nimposed with or without a judicial finding of brandishing,\nbecause the jury’s finding already authorized a sentence of\nfive years to life. 536 U. S., at 561. The dissent repeats\nthis argument today. See post, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.) (“The jury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose\nthe precise sentence he imposed for the precise factual\nreason he imposed it”). While undoubtedly true, this fact\nis beside the point.3\n——————\n   3 Apprendi rejected an argument similar to the one advanced in Har-\n\nris. In Apprendi, the State of New Jersey argued that increasing the\ndefendant’s statutory maximum on the challenged count did not violate\nthe Sixth Amendment because “the judge could have imposed consecu-\ntive sentences,” in conjunction with other counts, to produce the sen-\ntence that the defendant actually received on the count at issue. 530\nU. S., at 474. We found that this possibility did not preclude a Sixth\n14                 ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n  As noted, the essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is\nwhether a fact is an element of the crime. When a finding\nof fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to\naggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part\nof a new offense and must be submitted to the jury. It is\nno answer to say that the defendant could have received\nthe same sentence with or without that fact. It is obvious,\nfor example, that a defendant could not be convicted and\nsentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for\nlarceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime\nare identical. One reason is that each crime has different\nelements and a defendant can be convicted only if the jury\nhas found each element of the crime of conviction.\n  Similarly, because the fact of brandishing aggravates\nthe legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it\nconstitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense\nthat must be found by the jury, regardless of what sen-\ntence the defendant might have received if a different\nrange had been applicable. Indeed, if a judge were to find\na fact that increased the statutory maximum sentence,\nsuch a finding would violate the Sixth Amendment, even if\nthe defendant ultimately received a sentence falling within\nthe original sentencing range (i.e., the range applicable\nwithout that aggravating fact).

It is, accordingly, overruled.5\n                              C\n   In holding that facts that increase mandatory minimum\nsentences must be submitted to the jury, we take care to\nnote what our holding does not entail. Our ruling today\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\ntion must be found by a jury. We have long recognized\nthat broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial\nfactfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See,\ne.g., Dillon v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 11) (“[W]ithin established limits[,] . . . the exercise\nof [sentencing] discretion does not contravene the Sixth\n——————\nIllinois law provides for a sentence of 2 to 10 years’ imprisonment for\nintimidation, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, §5/12–6(b) (West 2010), and 3 to\n14 years for aggravated intimidation, §5/12–6.2(b). The elements of\naggravated intimidation include all the elements of intimidation plus\none enumerated aggravating fact. Under this statute, if a jury found\neach element of intimidation, but the judge purported to find a fact that\nelevated the offense to aggravated intimidation, the Sixth Amendment\nwould most certainly be violated, even if the defendant received a\nsentence that fell within both ranges. See also La. Rev. Stat.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002),\nand McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), were\nwrongly decided. Under the reasoning of our decision in\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and the\noriginal meaning of the Sixth Amendment, facts that\nincrease the statutory minimum sentence (no less than\nfacts that increase the statutory maximum sentence) are\nelements of the offense that must be found by a jury and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ante, at 1.\n   Of course, under our doctrine of stare decisis, establish-\ning that a decision was wrong does not, without more,\njustify overruling it. While stare decisis is not an “inexo-\nrable command,” Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 251\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), it is “a basic\nself-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which\nis entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fash-\nioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not\nbased upon ‘an arbitrary discretion,’ ” Patterson v. McLean\nCredit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (quoting The\nFederalist, No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamil-\nton)). We generally adhere to our prior decisions, even if\nwe question their soundness, because doing so “promotes\n2                ALLEYNE v.

Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991). To protect these important values, we require a\n“ ‘ “special justification” ’ ” when departing from precedent.\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).\n    A special justification is present here. As an initial\nmatter, when procedural rules are at issue that do not\ngovern primary conduct and do not implicate the reliance\ninterests of private parties, the force of stare decisis is\nreduced. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521\n(1995); Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. And any reliance interest\nthat the Federal Government and state governments\nmight have is particularly minimal here because prosecu-\ntors are perfectly able to “charge facts upon which a man-\ndatory minimum sentence is based in the indictment and\nprove them to a jury.” Harris, 536 U. S., at 581 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). Indeed, even with Harris in place, prose-\ncutors already sometimes charge such facts and seek to\nprove them to a jury.

That\nis precisely what happened here, where the verdict form\nallowed the jury to find whether petitioner had brandished\na firearm yet the jury declined to make such a finding.\nAnte, at 2.\n    In this context, stare decisis does not compel adherence\nto a decision whose “underpinnings” have been “eroded” by\nsubsequent developments of constitutional law. Gaudin,\n515 U. S., at 521. In rejecting a constitutional challenge to\na state statute that increased a defendant’s minimum\nsentence based on judicial factfinding, McMillan relied on\na distinction between “elements” and “sentencing factors.”\n477 U. S., at 86. That distinction was undermined by\nApprendi, where we held that a legislature may not “re-\nmove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

S., at 490 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   In Harris, we squarely confronted the question whether\n“McMillan stands after Apprendi.” 536 U. S., at 550. Five\nMembers of the Court recognized that the cases were in\nfact incompatible. See id., at 569 (BREYER, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); id., at 572, 583\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“[O]nly a minority of the Court\nembrac[es] the distinction between McMillan and Apprendi\nthat forms the basis of today’s holding”). In the control-\nling opinion, JUSTICE BREYER nevertheless declined to\napply Apprendi to mandatory minimums because, though\nhe found no way to distinguish sentencing floors from\nsentencing ceilings, he could not “yet accept” Apprendi\nitself. 536 U. S., at 569; see also post, at 1 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n   We have said that a decision may be “of questionable\nprecedential value” when “a majority of the Court expressly\ndisagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.” Seminole\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996). And\nHarris has stood on especially weak ground because its\nvitality depended upon the possibility that the Court\nmight retreat from Apprendi. See Harris, 536 U. S., at\n569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That has not happened.\nInstead, while individual Members of this Court have\ncontinued to question Apprendi, see post, at 1–2 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.); post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., dissenting), its rule\nhas become even more firmly rooted in the Court’s Sixth\nAmendment jurisprudence in the decade since Harris. We\nhave applied Apprendi to strike down mandatory sentenc-\ning systems at the state and federal levels. See Cunning-\nham v. California, 549 U. S. 270 (2007); United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296 (2004). And just last Term, we recognized that\nApprendi’s reasoning extends to criminal fines. See\n4                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nSouthern Union Co. v. United States, 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n  As a result of these decisions, Harris has become even\nmore of an outlier. For that reason, I agree that it is\nappropriate for the Court to “overrule Harris and to apply\nApprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to mandatory\nminimum sentences” in order to “erase th[is] anomaly” in\nour case law. Post, at 2–3 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I do not\nsuggest that every single factor that supports the overrul-\ning of precedent is present here. Post, at 3, n. * (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting). But particularly in a case where the reliance\ninterests are so minimal, and the reliance interests of\nprivate parties are nonexistent, stare decisis cannot excuse\na refusal to bring “coherence and consistency,” Patterson,\n491 U. S., at 174, to our Sixth Amendment law.\n  If any doubt remained, our decision in Ring v. Arizona,\n536 U. S. 584 (2002), should remove it. Ring considered\nan Apprendi challenge to Arizona’s capital sentencing\nsystem. There, as here, the government urged us to ad-\nhere to a pre-Apprendi decision upholding that scheme.\nSee Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). And there, as\nhere, we resisted that plea. Ring, 536 U. S., at 609. This\ncase differs in only one respect: Our post-Apprendi consid-\neration of the issue in Harris. But for the reasons given,\nHarris in no way strengthens the force of stare decisis in\nthis case. With Apprendi now firmly rooted in our juris-\nprudence, the Court simply gives effect to what five Mem-\nbers of the Court recognized in Harris: “[McMillan] and\nApprendi are irreconcilable; our Sixth Amendment juris-\nprudence cannot be home to both.” 536 U. S., at 609.\n  JUSTICE ALITO is therefore mistaken when he suggests\nthat the Court overrules Harris because “there are cur-\nrently five Justices willing to vote to” do so. Post, at 3, n.\n*. No doubt, it would be illegitimate to overrule a prece-\ndent simply because the Court’s current membership\ndisagrees with it. But that is not a plausible account of\nthe decision today. The Court overrules McMillan and\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Likewise, JUSTICE\nALITO exaggerates when he suggests that this case creates\nan important “precedent about precedent.” Post, at 2.\nRarely will a claim for stare decisis be as weak as it is\nhere, where a constitutional rule of criminal procedure is\nat issue that a majority of the Court has previously recog-\nnized is incompatible with our broader jurisprudence.\nAnd finally, JUSTICE ALITO’s contention that Apprendi and\nHarris stand on equal footing for stare decisis purposes,\npost, at 1–2, 3–4, n. *, is simply inconsistent with our last\ndecade of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.\n  Because I believe that the Court’s decision to apply\nApprendi to mandatory minimums is consistent with stare\ndecisis principles, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

United States, 536 U. S.\n545 (2002), I wrote that “I cannot easily distinguish Ap-\nprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), from this case\nin terms of logic.” Id., at 569 (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). I nonetheless accepted\nHarris’ holding because I could “[n]ot yet accept [Ap-\nprendi’s] rule.” 536 U. S., at 569. I continue to disagree\nwith Apprendi. See 536 U. S., at 569–570; United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220, 326 (2005) (opinion dissenting in\npart); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 328 (2004)\n(dissenting opinion); Apprendi, supra, at 555 (same). But\nApprendi has now defined the relevant legal regime for an\nadditional decade. And, in my view, the law should no\nlonger tolerate the anomaly that the Apprendi/Harris\ndistinction creates.\n   The Court’s basic error in Apprendi, I believe, was its\nfailure to recognize the law’s traditional distinction be-\ntween elements of a crime (facts constituting the crime,\ntypically for the jury to determine) and sentencing facts\n(facts affecting the sentence, often concerning, e.g., the\nmanner in which the offender committed the crime, and\ntypically for the judge to determine). The early historical\nreferences that this Court’s opinions have set forth in\n2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfavor of Apprendi refer to offense elements, not to sentenc-\ning facts. Thus, when Justice Story wrote that the Sixth\nAmendment’s guarantee of trial by jury offered “ ‘securit[y]\nagainst the prejudices of judges,’ ” post, at 4 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting) (quoting Commentaries on the Consti-\ntution of the United States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833)), he\nwas likely referring to elements of a crime; and the best\nanswer to JUSTICE SCALIA’s implicit question in Apprendi—\nwhat, exactly, does the “right to trial by jury” guaran-\ntee?—is that it guarantees a jury’s determination of facts\nthat constitute the elements of a crime. 530 U. S., at 498–\n499 (concurring opinion).\n  Although I have set forth these minority views be-\nfore, see Booker, supra, at 326 (opinion dissenting in part);\nBlakely, supra, at 328 (dissenting opinion); Apprendi, su-\npra, at 555 (same), I repeat this point now to make clear\nwhy I cannot accept the dissent’s characterization of the\nSixth Amendment as simply seeking to prevent “judicial\noverreaching” when sentencing facts are at issue, post,\nat 4. At the very least, the Amendment seeks to protect\ndefendants against “the wishes and opinions of the gov-\nernment” as well. Ibid. (quoting Story, supra, §924, at\n657). And, that being so, it seems to me highly anomalous\nto read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing\nfacts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence\nwhile not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that\nrequire a judge to impose a higher sentence. See Harris,\nsupra, at 569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\n  To overrule Harris and to apply Apprendi’s basic jury-\ndetermination rule to mandatory minimum sentences\nwould erase that anomaly. Where a maximum sentence is\nat issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to im-\npose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the\nrequisite statutory factual predicate. Where a manda-\ntory minimum sentence is at issue, application of Apprendi\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwould mean that the government cannot force a judge who\ndoes not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless\na jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate. In\nboth instances the matter concerns higher sentences; in\nboth instances factfinding must trigger the increase; in both\ninstances jury-based factfinding would act as a check: in\nthe first instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly\nimposing the higher sentence that the judge believes is\nappropriate, and in the second instance, against a sentenc-\ning judge wrongly being required to impose the higher\nsentence that the judge believes is inappropriate.\n  While Harris has been the law for 11 years, Apprendi\nhas been the law for even longer; and I think the time has\ncome to end this anomaly in Apprendi’s application. Con-\nsequently, I vote to overrule Harris. I join Parts I, III–B,\nIII–C, and IV of the Court’s opinion and concur in its\njudgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And suppose the judge says\nhe would sentence the defendant to five years, but because\nhe finds that the defendant used a gun during the crime,\nhe is going to add two years and sentence him to seven.\nNo one thinks that this violates the defendant’s right to\na jury trial in any way.\n   Now suppose the legislature says that two years should\nbe added to the five year minimum, if the judge finds that\nthe defendant used a gun during the crime. Such a provi-\nsion affects the role of the judge—limiting his discretion—\nbut has no effect on the role of the jury. And because it\ndoes not affect the jury’s role, it does not violate the jury\ntrial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.\n   The Framers envisioned the Sixth Amendment as a pro-\ntection for defendants from the power of the Government.\nThe Court transforms it into a protection for judges from\nthe power of the legislature. For that reason, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                          I\n  In a steady stream of cases decided over the last 15\nyears, this Court has sought to identify the historical\n2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nunderstanding of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right\nand determine how that understanding applies to modern\nsentencing practice. Our key sources in this task have\nbeen 19th-century treatises and common law cases identi-\nfying which facts qualified as “elements” of a crime, and\ntherefore had to be alleged in the indictment and proved to\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 476–483, 489–490, n. 15 (2000)\n(collecting sources); id., at 501–518 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring) (same). With remarkable uniformity, those author-\nities provided that an element was “whatever is in law\nessential to the punishment sought to be inflicted.” 1 J.\nBishop, Criminal Procedure 50 (2d ed. 1872); see also\nApprendi, supra, at 489, n. 15 (“ ‘[T]he indictment must\ncontain an allegation of every fact which is legally essen-\ntial to the punishment to be inflicted’ ” (quoting United\nStates v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232 (1876) (Clifford, J., dis-\nsenting))); 1 Bishop, supra, §87, at 55 (an indictment must\ninclude “any particular fact which the law makes essential\nto the punishment”).\n   Judging that this common law rule best reflects what\nthe Framers understood the Sixth Amendment jury right\nto protect, we have struck down sentencing schemes that\nwere inconsistent with the rule. In Apprendi, for example,\nthe defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried a\nmaximum sentence of ten years. After his plea, however,\nthe trial judge determined that the defendant had commit-\nted the crime with a biased purpose. Under a New Jersey\nlaw, that finding allowed the judge to impose up to ten\nadditional years in prison. Exercising that authority, the\njudge sentenced the defendant to 12 years. 530 U. S., at\n469–471.\n   Because the sentence was two years longer than would\nhave been possible without the finding of bias, that find-\ning was “essential to the punishment” imposed. 1 Bishop,\nsupra, at 50; see Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 491–492. Thus,\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nin line with the common law rule, we held the New Jersey\nprocedure unconstitutional. Id., at 497.\n   Subsequent cases have worked out how this principle\napplies in other contexts, such as capital sentencing re-\ngimes, state and federal sentencing guidelines, or criminal\nfines. See Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002); Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004); United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220 (2005); Southern Union Co. v. United\nStates, 567 U. S. ___ (2012). Through all of them, we have\nadhered to the rule, rooted in the common law under-\nstanding described above, that we laid down in Apprendi:\n“Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490; see\nBlakely, supra, at 301 (quoting above statement); Booker,\nsupra, at 231 (same); Southern Union Co., supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 3) (same); see also Ring, supra, at 588–589\n(Sixth Amendment “does not permit a defendant to be\n‘expose[d] . . . to a penalty exceeding the maximum he\nwould receive if punished according to the facts reflected\nin the jury verdict alone’ ” (quoting Apprendi, supra, at\n483; alterations in original).\n   We have embraced this 19th-century common law rule\nbased not only on a judgment that it reflects the under-\nstanding in place when the Sixth Amendment was rati-\nfied, but also on the “need to give intelligible content to the\nright of jury trial.” Blakely, supra, at 305. As JUSTICE\nSCALIA wrote in Apprendi, it is unclear “what the right to\ntrial by jury does guarantee if . . . it does not guarantee . . .\nthe right to have a jury determine those facts that deter-\nmine the maximum sentence the law allows.” 530 U. S., at\n498–499 (concurring opinion).\n   After all, if a judge’s factfinding could authorize a sen-\ntence beyond that allowed by the jury’s verdict alone, the\njury trial would be “a mere preliminary to a judicial inqui-\n4                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsition into the facts of the crime the State actually seeks to\npunish.” Blakely, supra, at 306–307. The Framers clearly\nenvisioned a more robust role for the jury. They appreci-\nated the danger inherent in allowing “justices . . . named\nby the crown” to “imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that\nwas obnoxious to the government, by an instant declara-\ntion, that such is their will and pleasure.” 4 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769).\nTo guard against this “violence and partiality of judges\nappointed by the crown,” the common law “wisely placed\nth[e] strong . . . barrier, of . . . trial by jury, between the\nliberties of the people, and the prerogative of the crown.”\nIbid. The Sixth Amendment therefore provided for trial\nby jury as a “double security, against the prejudices of\njudges, who may partake of the wishes and opinions of the\ngovernment, and against the passions of the multitude,\nwho may demand their victim with a clamorous precipi-\ntancy.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833); see also The Fed-\neralist No. 83, p. 499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)\n(discussing criminal jury trial as a protection against\n“judicial despotism”). Our holdings that a judge may not\nsentence a defendant to more than the jury has authorized\nproperly preserve the jury right as a guard against judicial\noverreaching.\n                              II\n   There is no such risk of judicial overreaching here.\nUnder 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i), the jury’s verdict fully\nauthorized the judge to impose a sentence of anywhere\nfrom five years to life in prison. No additional finding of\nfact was “essential” to any punishment within the range.\nAfter rendering the verdict, the jury’s role was completed,\nit was discharged, and the judge began the process of\ndetermining where within that range to set Alleyne’s\nsentence.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  Everyone agrees that in making that determination, the\njudge was free to consider any relevant facts about the of-\nfense and offender, including facts not found by the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n    “[B]oth before and since the American colonies became\n    a nation, courts . . . practiced a policy under which a\n    sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the\n    sources and types of evidence used to assist him in\n    determining the kind and extent of punishment to be\n    imposed within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New\n    York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949).\nAs Apprendi itself recognized, “nothing in this history\nsuggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise\ndiscretion—taking into consideration various factors\nrelating both to offense and offender—in imposing a judg-\nment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530 U. S.,\nat 481 (emphasis deleted); see also Dillon v. United States,\n560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 11). And the majority\ndoes not dispute the point. Ante, at 15 (“Our ruling today\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\ntion must be found by a jury.”). Thus, under the majority’s\nrule, in the absence of a statutory mandatory minimum,\nthere would have been no constitutional problem had the\njudge, exercising the discretion given him by the jury’s\nverdict, decided that seven years in prison was the appro-\npriate penalty for the crime because of his finding that the\nfirearm had been brandished during the offense.\n   In my view, that is enough to resolve this case. The\njury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose the precise\nsentence he imposed for the precise factual reason he\nimposed it. As we have recognized twice before, the Sixth\nAmendment demands nothing more. See Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 568–569 (2002); McMillan v. Penn-\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986).\n6               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   This approach is entirely consistent with Apprendi. As\nI have explained, Apprendi’s constraint on the normal\nlegislative control of criminal procedure draws its legiti-\nmacy from two primary principles: (1) common law under-\nstandings of the “elements” of a crime, and (2) the need to\npreserve the jury as a “strong barrier” between defendants\nand the State. Neither of those principles supports the\nrule the majority adopts today.\n   First, there is no body of historical evidence supporting\ntoday’s new rule. The majority does not identify a single\ncase holding that a fact affecting only the sentencing floor\nqualified as an element or had to be found by a jury, nor\ndoes it point to any treatise language to that effect. Ante,\nat 8–10. To be sure, the relatively recent vintage of man-\ndatory minimum sentencing enhancements means that\nfew, if any, 19th-century courts would have encountered\nsuch a fact pattern. So I do not mean to suggest that\nthe absence of historical condemnation of the practice con-\nclusively establishes its constitutionality today. But given\nthat Apprendi’s rule rests heavily on affirmative historical\nevidence about the practices to which we have previously\napplied it, the lack of such evidence on statutory mini-\nmums is a good reason not to extend it here.\n   Nor does the majority’s extension of Apprendi do any-\nthing to preserve the role of the jury as a safeguard be-\ntween the defendant and the State. That is because even\nif a jury does not find that the firearm was brandished,\na judge can do so and impose a harsher sentence because\nof his finding, so long as that sentence remains under the\nstatutory maximum. The question here is about the power\nof judges, not juries. Under the rule in place until today,\na legislature could tell judges that certain facts carried\ncertain weight, and require the judge to devise a sentence\nbased on that weight—so long as the sentence remained\nwithin the range authorized by the jury. Now, in the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nname of the jury right that formed a barrier between the\ndefendant and the State, the majority has erected a bar-\nrier between judges and legislatures, establishing that\ndiscretionary sentencing is the domain of judges. Legisla-\ntures must keep their respectful distance.\n   I find this new rule impossible to square with the histor-\nical understanding of the jury right as a defense from\njudges, not a defense of judges. See Apprendi, supra, at\n498 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“Judges, it is sometimes\nnecessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State”).\nJust as the Sixth Amendment “limits judicial power only\nto the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on\nthe province of the jury,” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, so too\nit limits legislative power only to the extent that power\ninfringes on the province of the jury. Because the claimed\ninfringement here is on the province of the judge, not the\njury, the jury right has no work to do.\n                               IV\n   The majority offers several arguments to the contrary. I\ndo not find them persuasive.\n   First, the majority asserts that “because the legally\nprescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it\nfollows that a fact increasing either end of the range pro-\nduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the\noffense.” Ante, at 11 (citation omitted). The syllogism\ntrips out of the gate, for its first premise—that the consti-\ntutionally relevant “penalty” includes the bottom end of\nthe statutory range—simply assumes the answer to the\nquestion presented. Neither of the historical sources to\nwhich the majority points gives an answer: The Bishop\ntreatise speaks only to situations in which “a statute\nprescribes a particular punishment,” not a range of possi-\nble punishments. 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure §598, at\n360–361. The Wharton treatise is similarly unhelpful,\nfocusing on statutes that change the maximum or alter the\n8               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

The sources\nprovided in the Apprendi concurrence offer no support, for\nas already discussed, we lack historical evidence about the\ntreatment of facts that altered only the floor of a sentenc-\ning range.\n   Second, the majority observes that “criminal statutes\nhave long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\nranges, which is evidence that both define the legally\nprescribed penalty.” Ante, at 11. Again, though, this\nsimply assumes the core premise: That the constitution-\nally relevant “penalty” involves both the statutory minimum\nand the maximum. Unless one accepts that premise on\nfaith, the fact that statutes have long specified both floor\nand ceiling is evidence of nothing more than that stat-\nutes have long specified both the floor and the ceiling. Nor\ndoes it help to say that “the floor of a mandatory range is\nas relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.” Ante, at 12. The\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on what\nwrongdoers care about most.\n   More importantly, legal rules frequently focus on the\nmaximum sentence while ignoring the minimum, even\nthough both are “relevant” to punishment. Closest to this\ncase, the question whether the jury right applies at all\nturns on whether the maximum sentence exceeds six\nmonths—not, say, whether the minimum punishment\ninvolves time in prison. Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489\nU. S. 538, 543 (1989); see also Lewis v. United States, 518\nU. S. 322, 326 (1996) (“In evaluating the seriousness of the\noffense, we place primary emphasis on the maximum\nprison term authorized”). Likewise, the rights to vote and\nto bear arms are typically denied to felons—that is, those\nconvicted of a crime with a maximum sentence of more\nthan one year in prison. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418\nU. S. 24, 48 (1974); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554\nU. S. 570, 626 (2008); Black’s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n2009). Examples of other distinctions turning only on max-\nimum penalties abound, as in cases of recidivism en-\nhancements that apply only to prior convictions with a\nmaximum sentence of more than a specified number of\nyears. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2). That a minimum\nsentence is “relevant” to punishment, and that a statute\ndefines it, does not mean it must be treated the same as\nthe maximum sentence the law allows.\n   Third, the majority offers that “it is impossible to dis-\npute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor\naggravate the punishment.” Ante, at 12. This argument\nproves too much, for it would apply with equal force to any\nfact which leads the judge, in the exercise of his own dis-\ncretion, to choose a penalty higher than he otherwise\nwould have chosen. The majority nowhere explains what\nit is about the jury right that bars a determination by\nCongress that brandishing (or any other fact) makes an\noffense worth two extra years, but not an identical deter-\nmination by a judge. Simply calling one “aggravation” and\nthe other “discretion” does not do the trick.\n   Fourth, the majority argues that “[i]t is no answer to say\nthat the defendant could have received the same sentence\nwith or without” a particular factual finding, pointing out\n“that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for\nassault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if\nthe punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.”\nAnte, at 14. In that hypothetical case, the legislature has\nchosen to define two crimes with two different sets of\nelements. Courts must, of course, respect that legislative\njudgment. But that tells us nothing about when courts\ncan override the legislature’s decision not to create sepa-\nrate crimes, and instead to treat a particular fact as a\ntrigger for a minimum sentence within the already-\nauthorized range.\n10              ALLEYNE v.

See ante, at 16, n. 6.\nStare decisis is, of course, not an “inexorable command”\nin the field of constitutional law. Payne v. Tennessee, 501\nU. S. 808, 828 (1991). Nevertheless, the Court ought to be\nconsistent in its willingness to reconsider precedent. If\nHarris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), and McMil-\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), can be cast aside\nsimply because a majority of this Court now disagrees\nwith them, that same approach may properly be followed\nin future cases. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 358–\n364 (2009) (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n  If the Court is of a mind to reconsider existing prece-\ndent, a prime candidate should be Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466 (2000). Although Apprendi purported to rely\non the original understanding of the jury trial right, there\nare strong reasons to question the Court’s analysis on that\npoint. See, e.g., Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence\nEnhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.

The fact\nthat the Framers themselves wrote over a dozen indeter-\nminate sentencing ranges in the first federal crime bill (see\n1 Stat. 112–118 . . .), has simply been overlooked by the\nCourt”); Mitchell, Apprendi’s Domain, 2006 Sup.

First, that line of cases is predicated on a\npurported Sixth Amendment requirement that juries find facts that\nincrease maximum penalties, not mandatory minimums. Accordingly,\nas THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent persuasively explains, ante, at 1–7,\nApprendi and its progeny have no impact on the distinct question\nresolved by Harris, which does not bear on the jury right. Second, the\nApprendi line is now too intellectually incoherent to undermine any\n“contrary” precedents. If the rationale of Apprendi—which, as broadly\nconstrued by the Court in this case, is that “[a]ny fact that, by law,\nincreases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’ that must be submitted\nto the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,” ante, at 1—were\ntaken seriously, discretionary sentencing, as prescribed by 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a), should also be held to violate the Sixth Amendment. But a\nmajority of the Court has not been willing to go where its reasoning\nleads.\n  Nor can it be correct to say that “Harris in no way strengthens the\nforce of stare decisis in this case” because a “ ‘majority of the Court\nexpressly disagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.’ ” Ante, at 3–4\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\n517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996)). Decisions in which no one rationale commands\na majority of the Court—including prominent decisions based on the\nviews of a single Justice—are often thought to have precedential effect.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Regents of Univ.\nof Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 269–272 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).\nAnd, of course, if Harris is not entitled to stare decisis weight, then\nneither is the Court’s opinion in this case. After all, only four Members\nof the Court think that the Court’s holding is the correct reading of\nthe Constitution. See ante, at 1–3 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment).\n  As she concedes, ante, at 4, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurrence is nec-\nessarily selective in its discussion of the factors that the Court has\npreviously found to be relevant to the application of stare decisis. For\nexample, she does not argue—presumably because there is no good\nargument to be made—that Harris and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477\nU. S. 79 (1986) (which provide the framework under which criminal\nprosecutions have been carried out for at least the past 27 years) have\nproved “ ‘unworkable.’ ” Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004)\n(plurality opinion) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991)). Nor does she contend that “circumstances” outside the Court\n“have changed so radically as to undermine [Harris’] critical factual\nassumptions.” Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 244 (2006) (plurality\nopinion). Indeed, no party or amicus has cited any such circumstances.\n  In short, other than the fact that there are currently five Justices\n4                   ALLEYNE v.

If the opportunity arises in the\nfuture to overrule Apprendi or the present case—both of which presum-\nably involve “procedural rules . . . that do not govern primary conduct\nand do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties,” ante, at 2\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring)—the precedent the Court sets today will be\nrelevant to the issue of stare decisis.\n</pre>", "id": 903985, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/06/17/alleyne_v._united_states_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued January 14, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\nPetitioner Alleyne was charged, as relevant here, with using or carry-\n  ing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U. S. C.\n  §924(c)(1)(A), which carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence,\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i), that increases to a 7-year minimum “if the firearm is\n  brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum “if the fire-\n  arm is discharged,” §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). In convicting Alleyne, the jury\n  form indicated that he had “[u]sed or carried a firearm during and in\n  relation to a crime of violence,” but not that the firearm was\n  “[b]randished.” When the presentence report recommended a 7-year\n  sentence on the §924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the ver-\n  dict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing be-\n  yond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum\n  sentence based on a sentencing judge’s finding of brandishing would\n  violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The District Court\n  overruled his objection, relying on this Court’s holding in Harris v.\n  United States, 536 U. S. 545, that judicial factfinding that increases\n  the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible under\n  the Sixth Amendment. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that\n  Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by Harris.\nHeld: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. Pp. 10–17.\n457 Fed. Appx. 348, vacated and remanded.\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV, concluding:\n    1. Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for\n  a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “ele-\n  ment” that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, Harris is\n  overruled. Pp. 10–16.\n2                      ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n           (a) Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, concluded that any\n    “ ‘facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a\n    criminal defendant is exposed’ ” are elements of the crime, id., at 490,\n    and thus the Sixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to\n    have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 484.\n    Apprendi’s principle applies with equal force to facts increasing the\n    mandatory minimum, for a fact triggering a mandatory minimum al-\n    ters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant\n    is exposed. Id., at 490. Because the legally prescribed range is the\n    penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either\n    end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredi-\n    ent of the offense. It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentenc-\n    ing range from the penalty affixed to the crime. The fact that crimi-\n    nal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\n    ranges is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty. It\n    is also impossible to dispute that the facts increasing the legally pre-\n    scribed floor aggravate the punishment, heightening the loss of liber-\n    ty associated with the crime. Defining facts that increase a mandato-\n    ry minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the\n    defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of\n    the indictment, see id., at 478–479, and preserves the jury’s historic\n    role as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants,\n    see United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510–511. In reaching a\n    contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the fact that the 7-year mini-\n    mum sentence could have been imposed with or without a judicial\n    finding of brandishing, because the jury’s finding authorized a sen-\n    tence of five years to life, 536 U. S., at 561, but that fact is beside the\n    point. The essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is\n    an element of the crime. Because the fact of brandishing aggravates\n    the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an\n    element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the\n    jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received\n    had a different range been applicable. There is no basis in principle\n    or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that\n    increase the minimum. Pp. 10–15.\n           (b) This ruling does not mean that any fact that influences judi-\n    cial discretion must be found by a jury. This Court has long recog-\n    nized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfind-\n    ing, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Dillon v. United\n    States, 560 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 15–16.\n        2. Here, the sentencing range supported by the jury’s verdict was\n    five years’ imprisonment to life, but the judge, rather than the jury,\n    found brandishing. This increased the penalty to which Alleyne was\n    subjected and violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Pp. 16–17.\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The Sixth Amendment right to trial “by an impartial jury,” in\nconjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each element\nof a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Gaudin,\n515 U. S., at 510. Several divided opinions of this Court have ad-\ndressed the constitutional status of a “sentencing factor.” In McMil-\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86, the Court held that facts found\nto increase a mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\nthat a judge could find by a preponderance of the evidence. In Ap-\nprendi, however, the Court declined to extend McMillan to a New\nJersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment if\nthe trial judge found that the crime was committed with racial bias,\n530 U. S., at 470, finding that any fact that increased the prescribed\nstatutory maximum sentence must be an “element” of the offense to\nbe found by the jury. Id., at 483, n. 10, 490. Two years later in Har-\nris, the Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the\nmandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence. 536\nU. S., at 557. Pp. 3–6.\n   2. The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an\n“element” of the charged offense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S.\n218, ___. Apprendi’s definition necessarily includes not only facts\nthat increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor. At\ncommon law, the relationship between crime and punishment was\nclear. A sentence was prescribed for each offense, leaving judges\nwith little sentencing discretion. If a fact was by law essential to the\npenalty, it was an element of the offense. There was a well-\nestablished practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to\nthe jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing pun-\nishment. And this understanding was reflected in contemporaneous\ncourt decisions and treatises. Pp. 6–10.\n   JUSTICE BREYER, agreeing that Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.\n545, should be overruled, concluded that he continues to disagree\nwith Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, because it fails to recog-\nnize the law’s traditional distinction between elements of a crime and\nsentencing facts, but finds it highly anomalous to read Apprendi as\ninsisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to im-\npose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing\nfacts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence. Overruling\nHarris and applying Apprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to\nmandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly. Where a\nmaximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who\nwishes to impose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds\n4                    ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    the requisite statutory factual predicate. Where a mandatory mini-\n    mum sentence is at issue, Apprendi would mean that the government\n    cannot force a judge who does not wish to impose a higher sentence to\n    do so unless a jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate.\n    Pp. 1–3.\n\n   THOMAS, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the\nopinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV, in\nwhich GINSBURG, BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., joined, and an\nopinion with respect to Parts II and III–A, in which GINSBURG, SO-\nTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ., joined.

Accordingly,\nHarris is overruled.\n                               I\n   Petitioner Allen Ryan Alleyne and an accomplice de-\nvised a plan to rob a store manager as he drove the store’s\ndaily deposits to a local bank. By feigning car trouble,\nthey tricked the manager to stop. Alleyne’s accomplice\napproached the manager with a gun and demanded the\nstore’s deposits, which the manager surrendered. Alleyne\nwas later charged with multiple federal offenses, includ-\ning robbery affecting interstate commerce, 18 U. S. C.\n§1951(a), and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a\ncrime of violence, §924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) pro-\nvides, in relevant part, that anyone who “uses or carries a\nfirearm” in relation to a “crime of violence” shall:\n      “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\n    less than 5 years;\n      “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\n      “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”\nThe jury convicted Alleyne. The jury indicated on the\nverdict form that Alleyne had “[u]sed or carried a firearm\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence,” but did not\nindicate a finding that the firearm was “[b]randished.”\nApp. 40.\n  The presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence\non the §924(c) count, which reflected the mandatory min-\nimum sentence for cases in which a firearm has been\n“brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Alleyne objected to this\nrecommendation. He argued that it was clear from the\nverdict form that the jury did not find brandishing beyond\na reasonable doubt and that he was subject only to the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n5-year minimum for “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm.” Al-\nleyne contended that raising his mandatory minimum\nsentence based on a sentencing judge’s finding that he\nbrandished a firearm would violate his Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial.\n   The District Court overruled Alleyne’s objection. It\nexplained that, under Harris, brandishing was a sentenc-\ning factor that the court could find by a preponderance of\nevidence without running afoul of the Constitution. It\nfound that the evidence supported a finding of brandish-\ning, and sentenced Alleyne to seven years’ imprisonment\non the §924(c) count. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\nlikewise noting that Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by\nHarris. 457 Fed. Appx. 348 (CA4 2011) (per curiam).\n                             II\n  The Sixth Amendment provides that those “accused” of\na “crime” have the right to a trial “by an impartial jury.”\nThis right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause,\nrequires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Gaudin, 515\nU. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\n(1970). The substance and scope of this right depend upon\nthe proper designation of the facts that are elements of the\ncrime.\n                             A\n  The question of how to define a “crime”—and, thus, how\nto determine what facts must be submitted to the jury—\nhas generated a number of divided opinions from this\nCourt. The principal source of disagreement is the consti-\ntutional status of a special sort of fact known as a “sen-\ntencing factor.” This term was first used in McMillan v.\nPennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86 (1986), to refer to facts that\nare not found by a jury but that can still increase the\ndefendant’s punishment. Following McMillan’s introduc-\n4               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntion of this term, this Court has made a number of efforts\nto delimit its boundaries.\n    McMillan initially invoked the distinction between\n“elements” and “sentencing factors” to reject a constitu-\ntional challenge to Pennsylvania’s Mandatory Minimum\nSentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §9712 (1982). That law\nprovided that anyone convicted of certain felonies would\nbe subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if the judge\nfound, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person\n“ ‘visibly possessed a firearm’ ” in the course of committing\nspecified crimes. 477 U. S., at 81, n. 1. While the Court\nacknowledged that there were constitutional limits to the\nState’s ability to “defin[e] crimes and prescrib[e] penal-\nties,” it found that the Commonwealth had permissi-\nbly defined visible possession as a sentencing factor,\nrather than an element. Id., at 86. In the Court’s view,\nthis allowed the judge, rather than the jury, to find this\nfact by a preponderance of evidence without violating the\nConstitution.\n    McMillan did not address whether legislatures’ freedom\nto define facts as sentencing factors extended to findings\nthat increased the maximum term of imprisonment for an\noffense. We foreshadowed an answer to this question in\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999), but\ndid not resolve the issue until Apprendi. There, we identi-\nfied a concrete limit on the types of facts that legislatures\nmay designate as sentencing factors.\n    In Apprendi, the defendant was sentenced to 12 years’\nimprisonment under a New Jersey statute that increased\nthe maximum term of imprisonment from 10 years to 20\nyears if the trial judge found that the defendant commit-\nted his crime with racial bias. 530 U. S., at 470. In de-\nfending its sentencing scheme, the State of New Jersey\nargued that, under McMillan, the legislature could define\nracial bias as a sentencing factor to be found by the judge.\nWe declined to extend McMillan that far. We explained\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthat there was no “principled basis for treating” a fact\nincreasing the maximum term of imprisonment differently\nthan the facts constituting the base offense. 530 U. S., at\n476. The historic link between crime and punishment,\ninstead, led us to conclude that any fact that increased the\nprescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an “ele-\nment” of the offense to be found by the jury. Id., at 483,\nn. 10, 490. We, thus, found that Apprendi’s sentence\nhad been unconstitutionally enhanced by the judge’s finding\nof racial bias by a preponderance of evidence. Id., at\n491–492.\n                              B\n  While Apprendi only concerned a judicial finding that\nincreased the statutory maximum, the logic of Apprendi\nprompted questions about the continuing vitality, if not\nvalidity, of McMillan’s holding that facts found to increase\nthe mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\nand not elements of the crime. We responded two years\nlater in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, where we\nconsidered the same statutory provision and the same\nquestion before us today.\n  In Harris, the defendant was charged, under §924(c)\n(1)(A), with carrying a firearm in the course of committing\na drug trafficking crime. The mandatory minimum sen-\ntence based on the jury’s verdict alone was five years, but\nthe District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum\nsentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evi-\ndence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm. As\nin this case, Harris challenged his sentence on the ground\nthat the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was uncon-\nstitutional under Apprendi, even though the judge’s find-\ning did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was\nexposed. Harris, supra, at 551.\n  The Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that\nincreased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the\n6                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nmaximum sentence. 536 U. S., at 557. In the Court’s\nview, judicial factfinding that increased the mandatory\nminimum did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. Be-\ncause the jury’s verdict “authorized the judge to impose\nthe minimum with or without the finding,” ibid., the Court\nwas of the view that the factual basis for increasing the\nminimum sentence was not “ ‘essential’ ” to the defendant’s\npunishment. Id., at 560–561 (plurality opinion). Instead,\nit merely limited the judge’s “choices within the author-\nized range.” Id., at 567. From this, the Court drew a\ndistinction between “facts increasing the defendant’s\nminimum sentence and facts extending the sentence be-\nyond the statutory maximum,” id., at 566. The Court\nlimited Apprendi’s holding to instances where the factual\nfinding increases the statutory maximum sentence.\n                          III\n  Alleyne contends that Harris was wrongly decided\nand that it cannot be reconciled with our reasoning in\nApprendi. We agree.\n                              A\n   The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the\nfact constitutes an “element” or “ingredient” of the charged\noffense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. 218, ___ (2010)\n(slip op., at 5); Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10; J. Archbold,\nPleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 52 (5th Am. ed.\n1846) (hereinafter Archbold). In Apprendi, we held that a\nfact is by definition an element of the offense and must be\nsubmitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above\nwhat is otherwise legally prescribed. 530 U. S., at 483,\nn. 10. While Harris declined to extend this principle to\nfacts increasing mandatory minimum sentences, Appren-\ndi’s definition of “elements” necessarily includes not only\nfacts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe floor. Both kinds of facts alter the prescribed range of\nsentences to which a defendant is exposed and do so in a\nmanner that aggravates the punishment. 530 U. S., at\n483, n. 10; Harris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nFacts that increase the mandatory minimum sentence are\ntherefore elements and must be submitted to the jury and\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt.\n                              1\n   At common law, the relationship between crime and\npunishment was clear. As discussed in Apprendi, “[t]he\nsubstantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific,”\nmeaning “it prescribed a particular sentence for each\noffense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on\nthe Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\nEngland, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\ned. 1987) (quoted in Apprendi, supra, at 479). The system\nleft judges with little sentencing discretion: once the facts\nof the offense were determined by the jury, the “judge was\nmeant simply to impose [the prescribed] sentence.” Lang-\nbein, supra, at 36–37; see also 3 W. Blackstone, Commen-\ntaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768) (“THE judgment,\nthough pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their\ndetermination or sentence, but the determination and\nsentence of the law” (emphasis deleted)). This Court has\nrecognized that the same was true, in many instances,\nearly on in this country. United States v. Grayson, 438\nU. S. 41, 45 (1978); see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 1\nMass. 245 (1804) (describing state law that specified a\npunishment for larceny of damages three times the value\nof the stolen goods). While some early American statutes\nprovided ranges of permissible sentences, K. Stith & J.\nCabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the\nFederal Courts 9 (1998), the ranges themselves were\nlinked to particular facts constituting the elements of the\ncrime. E.g., Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. 13 (1862) (discussing\n8               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\narson statute that provided for a sentence of 7 to 14 years\nwhere the house was occupied at the time of the offense,\nbut a sentence of 3 to 10 if it was not); Ga. Penal Code\n§§4324–4325 (1867) (robbery “by open force or violence”\nwas punishable by 4 to 20 years’ imprisonment, while\n“[r]obbery by intimidation, or without using force and\nviolence,” was punishable by 2 to 5 years’ imprisonment).\nThis linkage of facts with particular sentence ranges\n(defined by both the minimum and the maximum) reflects\nthe intimate connection between crime and punishment.\n   Consistent with this connection between crime and\npunishment, various treatises defined “crime” as consist-\ning of every fact which “is in law essential to the punish-\nment sought to be inflicted,” 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Proce-\ndure 50 (2d ed. 1872) (hereinafter Bishop), or the whole of\nthe wrong “to which the law affixes . . . punishment,” id.,\n§80, at 51. See also 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure\n§84, p. 49 (4th ed. 1895) (defining crime as “that wrongful\naggregation [of elements] out of which the punishment\nproceeds”); Archbold 128 (defining crime to include any\nfact that “annexes a higher degree of punishment”). Nu-\nmerous high courts agreed that this formulation “accu-\nrately captured the common-law understanding of what\nfacts are elements of a crime.” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n511–512 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (collecting cases). If a\nfact was by law essential to the penalty, it was an element\nof the offense.\n                             2\n  From these widely recognized principles followed a well-\nestablished practice of including in the indictment, and\nsubmitting to the jury, every fact that was a basis for\nimposing or increasing punishment. While an exhaustive\nhistory need not be recounted here, see id., at 501–509\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (detailing practices of American\ncourts from the 1840’s onward), a few particularly salient\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nexamples illustrate the point. In Hope v. Commonwealth,\n50 Mass. 134 (1845), the defendant was indicted for (and\nconvicted of) larceny. The larceny statute established two\nlevels of sentencing based on whether the value of the\nstolen property exceeded $100. Because punishment\nvaried with value, the state high court found that value\nwas an element of the offense:\n    “Our statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the\n    punishment for larceny, with reference to the value of\n    the property stolen; and for this reason, as well as be-\n    cause it is in conformity with long established prac-\n    tice, the court are of [the] opinion that the value of the\n    property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the\n    indictment.” Id., at 137.\nNumerous other contemporaneous court decisions reflect\nthis same understanding. See, e.g., Ritchey v. State, 7\nBlackf. 168, 169 (Ind. 1844) (holding that indictment for\narson must allege value of property destroyed, because\nstatute set punishment based on value); United States v.\nFisher, 25 F. Cas. 1086 (No. 15,102) (CC Ohio 1849)\n(McLean, J.) (“A carrier of the mail is subject to a higher\npenalty where he steals a letter out of the mail, which\ncontains an article of value. And when this offense is\ncommitted, the indictment must allege the letter con-\ntained an article of value, which aggravates the offense\nand incurs a higher penalty”).\n  A number of contemporaneous treatises similarly took\nthe view that a fact that increased punishment must be\ncharged in the indictment. As one 19th-century commen-\ntator explained:\n    “Where a statute annexes a higher degree of punish-\n    ment to a common-law felony, if committed under\n    particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence,\n    in order to bring the defendant within that higher de-\n    gree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have\n10                  ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n     been committed under those circumstances, and must\n     state the circumstances with certainty and precision.\n     [2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170].” Archbold 51\n     (15th ed. 1862).\nAnother explained that “the indictment must contain an\nallegation of every fact which is legally essential to the\npunishment to be inflicted.” Bishop §81, at 51. This rule\n“enabled [the defendant] to determine the species of of-\nfence” with which he was charged “in order that he may\nprepare his defence accordingly . . . and that there may be\nno doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if the\ndefendant be convicted.” Archbold 44 (emphasis added).\nAs the Court noted in Apprendi, “[t]he defendant’s ability\nto predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the\nfelony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of\npunishment with crime.” 530 U. S., at 478.\n                             B\n   Consistent with common-law and early American prac-\ntice, Apprendi concluded that any “facts that increase the\nprescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defend-\nant is exposed” are elements of the crime. Id., at 490\n(internal quotation marks omitted); id., at 483, n. 10\n(“[F]acts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater\nthan that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition\n‘elements’ of a separate legal offense”).1 We held that the\nSixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to\nhave a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\nId., at 484. While Harris limited Apprendi to facts in-\ncreasing the statutory maximum, the principle applied in\nApprendi applies with equal force to facts increasing the\n——————\n  1 In Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), we\nrecognized a narrow exception to this general rule for the fact of a prior\nconviction. Because the parties do not contest that decision’s vitality,\nwe do not revisit it for purposes of our decision today.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          11\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nmandatory minimum.\n   It is indisputable that a fact triggering a mandatory\nminimum alters the prescribed range of sentences to\nwhich a criminal defendant is exposed. Apprendi, supra,\nat 490; Harris, 536 U. S., at 575, 582 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning). But for a finding of brandishing, the penalty is five\nyears to life in prison; with a finding of brandishing, the\npenalty becomes seven years to life. Just as the maximum\nof life marks the outer boundary of the range, so seven\nyears marks its floor. And because the legally prescribed\nrange is the penalty affixed to the crime, infra, this page,\nit follows that a fact increasing either end of the range\nproduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of\nthe offense. Apprendi, supra, at 501 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring); see also Bishop §598, at 360–361 (if “a statute pre-\nscribes a particular punishment to be inflicted on those\nwho commit it under special circumstances which it men-\ntions, or with particular aggravations,” then those special\ncircumstances must be specified in the indictment (em-\nphasis added)); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law §371, p. 291\n(rev. 7th ed. 1874) (similar).\n   It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentencing\nrange from the penalty affixed to the crime. See Harris,\nsupra, at 569 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and concur-\nring in judgment) (facts increasing the minimum and facts\nincreasing the maximum cannot be distinguished “in\nterms of logic”). Indeed, criminal statutes have long speci-\nfied both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is\nevidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.\nSee, e.g., supra, at 7–8; N. Y. Penal Code §§231–232, p. 70\n(1882) (punishment for first-degree robbery was 10 to 20\nyears’ imprisonment; second-degree robbery was 5 to 15\nyears); Va. Code ch. 192, §§1–2, p. 787 (2d ed. 1860) (arson\ncommitted at night was punishable by 5 to 10 years; arson\ncommitted during the day was 3 to 10 years). This histori-\ncal practice allowed those who violated the law to know, ex\n12                  ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nante, the contours of the penalty that the legislature af-\nfixed to the crime—and comports with the obvious truth\nthat the floor of a mandatory range is as relevant to\nwrongdoers as the ceiling. A fact that increases a sen-\ntencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the\noffense.\n   Moreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increas-\ning the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\nHarris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); O’Brien,\n560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\n(slip op., at 2). Elevating the low-end of a sentenc-\ning range heightens the loss of liberty associated with\nthe crime: the defendant’s “expected punishment has\nincreased as a result of the narrowed range” and “the prose-\ncution is empowered, by invoking the mandatory mini-\nmum, to require the judge to impose a higher punishment\nthan he might wish.” Apprendi, supra, at 522 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring). Why else would Congress link an in-\ncreased mandatory minimum to a particular aggravating\nfact other than to heighten the consequences for that\nbehavior? See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88, 89 (twice noting\nthat a mandatory minimum “ ‘ups the ante’ ” for a criminal\ndefendant); Harris, supra, at 580 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\nThis reality demonstrates that the core crime and the fact\ntriggering the mandatory minimum sentence together\nconstitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which\nmust be submitted to the jury.2\n——————\n   2 Juries must find any facts that increase either the statutory maxi-\n\nmum or minimum because the Sixth Amendment applies where a\nfinding of fact both alters the legally prescribed range and does so in a\nway that aggravates the penalty. Importantly, this is distinct from\nfactfinding used to guide judicial discretion in selecting a punishment\n“within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246\n(1949). While such findings of fact may lead judges to select sentences\nthat are more severe than the ones they would have selected without\nthose facts, the Sixth Amendment does not govern that element of\nsentencing.

See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\n478–479. It also preserves the historic role of the jury as\nan intermediary between the State and criminal defend-\nants. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 510–511\n(“This right was designed ‘to guard against a spirit of\noppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,’ and ‘was\nfrom very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the\nparent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and\npolitical liberties’ ” (quoting 2 J. Story, Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States §§1779, 1780, pp.\n540–541 (4th ed. 1873))); Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78,\n100 (1970) (“[T]he essential feature of a jury obviously lies\nin [its] interposition between the accused and his ac-\ncuser”); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 155 (1968) (“A\nright to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in\norder to prevent oppression by the Government”).\n   In adopting a contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the\nfact that the 7-year minimum sentence could have been\nimposed with or without a judicial finding of brandishing,\nbecause the jury’s finding already authorized a sentence of\nfive years to life. 536 U. S., at 561. The dissent repeats\nthis argument today. See post, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS,\nC. J.) (“The jury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose\nthe precise sentence he imposed for the precise factual\nreason he imposed it”). While undoubtedly true, this fact\nis beside the point.3\n——————\n   3 Apprendi rejected an argument similar to the one advanced in Har-\n\nris. In Apprendi, the State of New Jersey argued that increasing the\ndefendant’s statutory maximum on the challenged count did not violate\nthe Sixth Amendment because “the judge could have imposed consecu-\ntive sentences,” in conjunction with other counts, to produce the sen-\ntence that the defendant actually received on the count at issue. 530\nU. S., at 474. We found that this possibility did not preclude a Sixth\n14                 ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\n  As noted, the essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is\nwhether a fact is an element of the crime. When a finding\nof fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to\naggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part\nof a new offense and must be submitted to the jury. It is\nno answer to say that the defendant could have received\nthe same sentence with or without that fact. It is obvious,\nfor example, that a defendant could not be convicted and\nsentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for\nlarceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime\nare identical. One reason is that each crime has different\nelements and a defendant can be convicted only if the jury\nhas found each element of the crime of conviction.\n  Similarly, because the fact of brandishing aggravates\nthe legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it\nconstitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense\nthat must be found by the jury, regardless of what sen-\ntence the defendant might have received if a different\nrange had been applicable. Indeed, if a judge were to find\na fact that increased the statutory maximum sentence,\nsuch a finding would violate the Sixth Amendment, even if\nthe defendant ultimately received a sentence falling within\nthe original sentencing range (i.e., the range applicable\nwithout that aggravating fact). Cf. Hobbs v. State, 44 Tex.\n353 (1875) (reversing conviction where the defendant was\nindicted for a crime punishable by 2 to 5 years and sen-\ntenced to 3 years because the trial court improperly in-\nstructed the jury to sentence the defendant between 2 to\n10 years if it found a particular aggravating fact); State v.\nCallahan, 109 La. 946, 33 So. 931 (1903) (finding ex post\nfacto violation where a newly enacted law increased the\nrange of punishment, even though defendant was sen-\ntenced within the range established by the prior law).4\n——————\nAmendment violation.

It is, accordingly, overruled.5\n                              C\n   In holding that facts that increase mandatory minimum\nsentences must be submitted to the jury, we take care to\nnote what our holding does not entail. Our ruling today\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\ntion must be found by a jury. We have long recognized\nthat broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial\nfactfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See,\ne.g., Dillon v. United States, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 11) (“[W]ithin established limits[,] . . . the exercise\nof [sentencing] discretion does not contravene the Sixth\n——————\nIllinois law provides for a sentence of 2 to 10 years’ imprisonment for\nintimidation, Ill.

The elements of\naggravated intimidation include all the elements of intimidation plus\none enumerated aggravating fact. Under this statute, if a jury found\neach element of intimidation, but the judge purported to find a fact that\nelevated the offense to aggravated intimidation, the Sixth Amendment\nwould most certainly be violated, even if the defendant received a\nsentence that fell within both ranges.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002),\nand McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), were\nwrongly decided. Under the reasoning of our decision in\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and the\noriginal meaning of the Sixth Amendment, facts that\nincrease the statutory minimum sentence (no less than\nfacts that increase the statutory maximum sentence) are\nelements of the offense that must be found by a jury and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ante, at 1.\n   Of course, under our doctrine of stare decisis, establish-\ning that a decision was wrong does not, without more,\njustify overruling it. While stare decisis is not an “inexo-\nrable command,” Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 251\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), it is “a basic\nself-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which\nis entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fash-\nioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not\nbased upon ‘an arbitrary discretion,’ ” Patterson v. McLean\nCredit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (quoting The\nFederalist, No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamil-\nton)). We generally adhere to our prior decisions, even if\nwe question their soundness, because doing so “promotes\n2                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthe evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development\nof legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions,\nand contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the\njudicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991). To protect these important values, we require a\n“ ‘ “special justification” ’ ” when departing from precedent.\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).\n    A special justification is present here. As an initial\nmatter, when procedural rules are at issue that do not\ngovern primary conduct and do not implicate the reliance\ninterests of private parties, the force of stare decisis is\nreduced. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521\n(1995); Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. And any reliance interest\nthat the Federal Government and state governments\nmight have is particularly minimal here because prosecu-\ntors are perfectly able to “charge facts upon which a man-\ndatory minimum sentence is based in the indictment and\nprove them to a jury.” Harris, 536 U. S., at 581 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting). Indeed, even with Harris in place, prose-\ncutors already sometimes charge such facts and seek to\nprove them to a jury. See Brief for National Association of\nCriminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 26. That\nis precisely what happened here, where the verdict form\nallowed the jury to find whether petitioner had brandished\na firearm yet the jury declined to make such a finding.\nAnte, at 2.\n    In this context, stare decisis does not compel adherence\nto a decision whose “underpinnings” have been “eroded” by\nsubsequent developments of constitutional law. Gaudin,\n515 U. S., at 521. In rejecting a constitutional challenge to\na state statute that increased a defendant’s minimum\nsentence based on judicial factfinding, McMillan relied on\na distinction between “elements” and “sentencing factors.”\n477 U. S., at 86. That distinction was undermined by\nApprendi, where we held that a legislature may not “re-\nmove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nthe prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal\ndefendant is exposed.” 530 U. S., at 490 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   In Harris, we squarely confronted the question whether\n“McMillan stands after Apprendi.” 536 U. S., at 550. Five\nMembers of the Court recognized that the cases were in\nfact incompatible. See id., at 569 (BREYER, J., concurring\nin part and concurring in judgment); id., at 572, 583\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“[O]nly a minority of the Court\nembrac[es] the distinction between McMillan and Apprendi\nthat forms the basis of today’s holding”). In the control-\nling opinion, JUSTICE BREYER nevertheless declined to\napply Apprendi to mandatory minimums because, though\nhe found no way to distinguish sentencing floors from\nsentencing ceilings, he could not “yet accept” Apprendi\nitself. 536 U. S., at 569; see also post, at 1 (BREYER, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n   We have said that a decision may be “of questionable\nprecedential value” when “a majority of the Court expressly\ndisagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.” Seminole\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996). And\nHarris has stood on especially weak ground because its\nvitality depended upon the possibility that the Court\nmight retreat from Apprendi. See Harris, 536 U. S., at\n569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That has not happened.\nInstead, while individual Members of this Court have\ncontinued to question Apprendi, see post, at 1–2 (opinion\nof BREYER, J.); post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., dissenting), its rule\nhas become even more firmly rooted in the Court’s Sixth\nAmendment jurisprudence in the decade since Harris. We\nhave applied Apprendi to strike down mandatory sentenc-\ning systems at the state and federal levels. See Cunning-\nham v. California, 549 U. S. 270 (2007); United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Blakely v. Washington, 542\nU. S. 296 (2004). And just last Term, we recognized that\nApprendi’s reasoning extends to criminal fines. See\n4                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\n\nSouthern Union Co. v. United States, 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\n  As a result of these decisions, Harris has become even\nmore of an outlier. For that reason, I agree that it is\nappropriate for the Court to “overrule Harris and to apply\nApprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to mandatory\nminimum sentences” in order to “erase th[is] anomaly” in\nour case law. Post, at 2–3 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I do not\nsuggest that every single factor that supports the overrul-\ning of precedent is present here. Post, at 3, n. * (ALITO, J.,\ndissenting). But particularly in a case where the reliance\ninterests are so minimal, and the reliance interests of\nprivate parties are nonexistent, stare decisis cannot excuse\na refusal to bring “coherence and consistency,” Patterson,\n491 U. S., at 174, to our Sixth Amendment law.\n  If any doubt remained, our decision in Ring v. Arizona,\n536 U. S. 584 (2002), should remove it. Ring considered\nan Apprendi challenge to Arizona’s capital sentencing\nsystem. There, as here, the government urged us to ad-\nhere to a pre-Apprendi decision upholding that scheme.\nSee Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). And there, as\nhere, we resisted that plea. Ring, 536 U. S., at 609. This\ncase differs in only one respect: Our post-Apprendi consid-\neration of the issue in Harris. But for the reasons given,\nHarris in no way strengthens the force of stare decisis in\nthis case. With Apprendi now firmly rooted in our juris-\nprudence, the Court simply gives effect to what five Mem-\nbers of the Court recognized in Harris: “[McMillan] and\nApprendi are irreconcilable; our Sixth Amendment juris-\nprudence cannot be home to both.” 536 U. S., at 609.\n  JUSTICE ALITO is therefore mistaken when he suggests\nthat the Court overrules Harris because “there are cur-\nrently five Justices willing to vote to” do so. Post, at 3, n.\n*. No doubt, it would be illegitimate to overrule a prece-\ndent simply because the Court’s current membership\ndisagrees with it. But that is not a plausible account of\nthe decision today. The Court overrules McMillan and\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Likewise, JUSTICE\nALITO exaggerates when he suggests that this case creates\nan important “precedent about precedent.” Post, at 2.\nRarely will a claim for stare decisis be as weak as it is\nhere, where a constitutional rule of criminal procedure is\nat issue that a majority of the Court has previously recog-\nnized is incompatible with our broader jurisprudence.\nAnd finally, JUSTICE ALITO’s contention that Apprendi and\nHarris stand on equal footing for stare decisis purposes,\npost, at 1–2, 3–4, n. *, is simply inconsistent with our last\ndecade of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.\n  Because I believe that the Court’s decision to apply\nApprendi to mandatory minimums is consistent with stare\ndecisis principles, I join the opinion of the Court.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

United States, 536 U. S.\n545 (2002), I wrote that “I cannot easily distinguish Ap-\nprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), from this case\nin terms of logic.” Id., at 569 (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment). I nonetheless accepted\nHarris’ holding because I could “[n]ot yet accept [Ap-\nprendi’s] rule.” 536 U. S., at 569. I continue to disagree\nwith Apprendi. See 536 U. S., at 569–570; United States v.\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220, 326 (2005) (opinion dissenting in\npart); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 328 (2004)\n(dissenting opinion); Apprendi, supra, at 555 (same). But\nApprendi has now defined the relevant legal regime for an\nadditional decade. And, in my view, the law should no\nlonger tolerate the anomaly that the Apprendi/Harris\ndistinction creates.\n   The Court’s basic error in Apprendi, I believe, was its\nfailure to recognize the law’s traditional distinction be-\ntween elements of a crime (facts constituting the crime,\ntypically for the jury to determine) and sentencing facts\n(facts affecting the sentence, often concerning, e.g., the\nmanner in which the offender committed the crime, and\ntypically for the judge to determine).

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nfavor of Apprendi refer to offense elements, not to sentenc-\ning facts. Thus, when Justice Story wrote that the Sixth\nAmendment’s guarantee of trial by jury offered “ ‘securit[y]\nagainst the prejudices of judges,’ ” post, at 4 (ROBERTS,\nC. J., dissenting) (quoting Commentaries on the Consti-\ntution of the United States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833)), he\nwas likely referring to elements of a crime; and the best\nanswer to JUSTICE SCALIA’s implicit question in Apprendi—\nwhat, exactly, does the “right to trial by jury” guaran-\ntee?—is that it guarantees a jury’s determination of facts\nthat constitute the elements of a crime. 530 U. S., at 498–\n499 (concurring opinion).\n  Although I have set forth these minority views be-\nfore, see Booker, supra, at 326 (opinion dissenting in part);\nBlakely, supra, at 328 (dissenting opinion); Apprendi, su-\npra, at 555 (same), I repeat this point now to make clear\nwhy I cannot accept the dissent’s characterization of the\nSixth Amendment as simply seeking to prevent “judicial\noverreaching” when sentencing facts are at issue, post,\nat 4. At the very least, the Amendment seeks to protect\ndefendants against “the wishes and opinions of the gov-\nernment” as well. Ibid. (quoting Story, supra, §924, at\n657). And, that being so, it seems to me highly anomalous\nto read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing\nfacts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence\nwhile not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that\nrequire a judge to impose a higher sentence. See Harris,\nsupra, at 569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\n  To overrule Harris and to apply Apprendi’s basic jury-\ndetermination rule to mandatory minimum sentences\nwould erase that anomaly. Where a maximum sentence is\nat issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to im-\npose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the\nrequisite statutory factual predicate. Where a manda-\ntory minimum sentence is at issue, application of Apprendi\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nwould mean that the government cannot force a judge who\ndoes not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless\na jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate. In\nboth instances the matter concerns higher sentences; in\nboth instances factfinding must trigger the increase; in both\ninstances jury-based factfinding would act as a check: in\nthe first instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly\nimposing the higher sentence that the judge believes is\nappropriate, and in the second instance, against a sentenc-\ning judge wrongly being required to impose the higher\nsentence that the judge believes is inappropriate.\n  While Harris has been the law for 11 years, Apprendi\nhas been the law for even longer; and I think the time has\ncome to end this anomaly in Apprendi’s application. Con-\nsequently, I vote to overrule Harris. I join Parts I, III–B,\nIII–C, and IV of the Court’s opinion and concur in its\njudgment.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And suppose the judge says\nhe would sentence the defendant to five years, but because\nhe finds that the defendant used a gun during the crime,\nhe is going to add two years and sentence him to seven.\nNo one thinks that this violates the defendant’s right to\na jury trial in any way.\n   Now suppose the legislature says that two years should\nbe added to the five year minimum, if the judge finds that\nthe defendant used a gun during the crime. Such a provi-\nsion affects the role of the judge—limiting his discretion—\nbut has no effect on the role of the jury. And because it\ndoes not affect the jury’s role, it does not violate the jury\ntrial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.\n   The Framers envisioned the Sixth Amendment as a pro-\ntection for defendants from the power of the Government.\nThe Court transforms it into a protection for judges from\nthe power of the legislature. For that reason, I respect-\nfully dissent.\n                          I\n  In a steady stream of cases decided over the last 15\nyears, this Court has sought to identify the historical\n2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nunderstanding of the Sixth Amendment jury trial right\nand determine how that understanding applies to modern\nsentencing practice. Our key sources in this task have\nbeen 19th-century treatises and common law cases identi-\nfying which facts qualified as “elements” of a crime, and\ntherefore had to be alleged in the indictment and proved to\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 476–483, 489–490, n. 15 (2000)\n(collecting sources); id., at 501–518 (THOMAS, J., concur-\nring) (same). With remarkable uniformity, those author-\nities provided that an element was “whatever is in law\nessential to the punishment sought to be inflicted.” 1 J.\nBishop, Criminal Procedure 50 (2d ed. 1872); see also\nApprendi, supra, at 489, n. 15 (“ ‘[T]he indictment must\ncontain an allegation of every fact which is legally essen-\ntial to the punishment to be inflicted’ ” (quoting United\nStates v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232 (1876) (Clifford, J., dis-\nsenting))); 1 Bishop, supra, §87, at 55 (an indictment must\ninclude “any particular fact which the law makes essential\nto the punishment”).\n   Judging that this common law rule best reflects what\nthe Framers understood the Sixth Amendment jury right\nto protect, we have struck down sentencing schemes that\nwere inconsistent with the rule. In Apprendi, for example,\nthe defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried a\nmaximum sentence of ten years. After his plea, however,\nthe trial judge determined that the defendant had commit-\nted the crime with a biased purpose. Under a New Jersey\nlaw, that finding allowed the judge to impose up to ten\nadditional years in prison. Exercising that authority, the\njudge sentenced the defendant to 12 years. 530 U. S., at\n469–471.\n   Because the sentence was two years longer than would\nhave been possible without the finding of bias, that find-\ning was “essential to the punishment” imposed. 1 Bishop,\nsupra, at 50; see Apprendi, 530 U.

J., dissenting\n\nin line with the common law rule, we held the New Jersey\nprocedure unconstitutional. Id., at 497.\n   Subsequent cases have worked out how this principle\napplies in other contexts, such as capital sentencing re-\ngimes, state and federal sentencing guidelines, or criminal\nfines. See Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002); Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004); United States v. Booker,\n543 U. S. 220 (2005); Southern Union Co. v. United\nStates, 567 U. S. ___ (2012). Through all of them, we have\nadhered to the rule, rooted in the common law under-\nstanding described above, that we laid down in Apprendi:\n“Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490; see\nBlakely, supra, at 301 (quoting above statement); Booker,\nsupra, at 231 (same); Southern Union Co., supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 3) (same); see also Ring, supra, at 588–589\n(Sixth Amendment “does not permit a defendant to be\n‘expose[d] . . . to a penalty exceeding the maximum he\nwould receive if punished according to the facts reflected\nin the jury verdict alone’ ” (quoting Apprendi, supra, at\n483; alterations in original).\n   We have embraced this 19th-century common law rule\nbased not only on a judgment that it reflects the under-\nstanding in place when the Sixth Amendment was rati-\nfied, but also on the “need to give intelligible content to the\nright of jury trial.” Blakely, supra, at 305. As JUSTICE\nSCALIA wrote in Apprendi, it is unclear “what the right to\ntrial by jury does guarantee if . . . it does not guarantee . . .\nthe right to have a jury determine those facts that deter-\nmine the maximum sentence the law allows.” 530 U. S., at\n498–499 (concurring opinion).\n   After all, if a judge’s factfinding could authorize a sen-\ntence beyond that allowed by the jury’s verdict alone, the\njury trial would be “a mere preliminary to a judicial inqui-\n4                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsition into the facts of the crime the State actually seeks to\npunish.” Blakely, supra, at 306–307. The Framers clearly\nenvisioned a more robust role for the jury. They appreci-\nated the danger inherent in allowing “justices . . . named\nby the crown” to “imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that\nwas obnoxious to the government, by an instant declara-\ntion, that such is their will and pleasure.” 4 W. Black-\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769).\nTo guard against this “violence and partiality of judges\nappointed by the crown,” the common law “wisely placed\nth[e] strong . . . barrier, of . . . trial by jury, between the\nliberties of the people, and the prerogative of the crown.”\nIbid. The Sixth Amendment therefore provided for trial\nby jury as a “double security, against the prejudices of\njudges, who may partake of the wishes and opinions of the\ngovernment, and against the passions of the multitude,\nwho may demand their victim with a clamorous precipi-\ntancy.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\nUnited States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833); see also The Fed-\neralist No. 83, p. 499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)\n(discussing criminal jury trial as a protection against\n“judicial despotism”). Our holdings that a judge may not\nsentence a defendant to more than the jury has authorized\nproperly preserve the jury right as a guard against judicial\noverreaching.\n                              II\n   There is no such risk of judicial overreaching here.\nUnder 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i), the jury’s verdict fully\nauthorized the judge to impose a sentence of anywhere\nfrom five years to life in prison. No additional finding of\nfact was “essential” to any punishment within the range.\nAfter rendering the verdict, the jury’s role was completed,\nit was discharged, and the judge began the process of\ndetermining where within that range to set Alleyne’s\nsentence.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  Everyone agrees that in making that determination, the\njudge was free to consider any relevant facts about the of-\nfense and offender, including facts not found by the jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n    “[B]oth before and since the American colonies became\n    a nation, courts . . . practiced a policy under which a\n    sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the\n    sources and types of evidence used to assist him in\n    determining the kind and extent of punishment to be\n    imposed within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New\n    York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949).\nAs Apprendi itself recognized, “nothing in this history\nsuggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise\ndiscretion—taking into consideration various factors\nrelating both to offense and offender—in imposing a judg-\nment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530 U. S.,\nat 481 (emphasis deleted); see also Dillon v. United States,\n560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 11). And the majority\ndoes not dispute the point. Ante, at 15 (“Our ruling today\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\ntion must be found by a jury.”). Thus, under the majority’s\nrule, in the absence of a statutory mandatory minimum,\nthere would have been no constitutional problem had the\njudge, exercising the discretion given him by the jury’s\nverdict, decided that seven years in prison was the appro-\npriate penalty for the crime because of his finding that the\nfirearm had been brandished during the offense.\n   In my view, that is enough to resolve this case. The\njury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose the precise\nsentence he imposed for the precise factual reason he\nimposed it. As we have recognized twice before, the Sixth\nAmendment demands nothing more. See Harris v. United\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 568–569 (2002); McMillan v. Penn-\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986).\n6               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n                              III\n   This approach is entirely consistent with Apprendi. As\nI have explained, Apprendi’s constraint on the normal\nlegislative control of criminal procedure draws its legiti-\nmacy from two primary principles: (1) common law under-\nstandings of the “elements” of a crime, and (2) the need to\npreserve the jury as a “strong barrier” between defendants\nand the State. Neither of those principles supports the\nrule the majority adopts today.\n   First, there is no body of historical evidence supporting\ntoday’s new rule. The majority does not identify a single\ncase holding that a fact affecting only the sentencing floor\nqualified as an element or had to be found by a jury, nor\ndoes it point to any treatise language to that effect. Ante,\nat 8–10. To be sure, the relatively recent vintage of man-\ndatory minimum sentencing enhancements means that\nfew, if any, 19th-century courts would have encountered\nsuch a fact pattern. So I do not mean to suggest that\nthe absence of historical condemnation of the practice con-\nclusively establishes its constitutionality today. But given\nthat Apprendi’s rule rests heavily on affirmative historical\nevidence about the practices to which we have previously\napplied it, the lack of such evidence on statutory mini-\nmums is a good reason not to extend it here.\n   Nor does the majority’s extension of Apprendi do any-\nthing to preserve the role of the jury as a safeguard be-\ntween the defendant and the State. That is because even\nif a jury does not find that the firearm was brandished,\na judge can do so and impose a harsher sentence because\nof his finding, so long as that sentence remains under the\nstatutory maximum. The question here is about the power\nof judges, not juries. Under the rule in place until today,\na legislature could tell judges that certain facts carried\ncertain weight, and require the judge to devise a sentence\nbased on that weight—so long as the sentence remained\nwithin the range authorized by the jury. Now, in the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nname of the jury right that formed a barrier between the\ndefendant and the State, the majority has erected a bar-\nrier between judges and legislatures, establishing that\ndiscretionary sentencing is the domain of judges. Legisla-\ntures must keep their respectful distance.\n   I find this new rule impossible to square with the histor-\nical understanding of the jury right as a defense from\njudges, not a defense of judges. See Apprendi, supra, at\n498 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“Judges, it is sometimes\nnecessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State”).\nJust as the Sixth Amendment “limits judicial power only\nto the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on\nthe province of the jury,” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, so too\nit limits legislative power only to the extent that power\ninfringes on the province of the jury. Because the claimed\ninfringement here is on the province of the judge, not the\njury, the jury right has no work to do.\n                               IV\n   The majority offers several arguments to the contrary. I\ndo not find them persuasive.\n   First, the majority asserts that “because the legally\nprescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it\nfollows that a fact increasing either end of the range pro-\nduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the\noffense.” Ante, at 11 (citation omitted). The syllogism\ntrips out of the gate, for its first premise—that the consti-\ntutionally relevant “penalty” includes the bottom end of\nthe statutory range—simply assumes the answer to the\nquestion presented. Neither of the historical sources to\nwhich the majority points gives an answer: The Bishop\ntreatise speaks only to situations in which “a statute\nprescribes a particular punishment,” not a range of possi-\nble punishments. 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure §598, at\n360–361. The Wharton treatise is similarly unhelpful,\nfocusing on statutes that change the maximum or alter the\n8               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nnature of the common law crime. See 1 F. Wharton, Crim-\ninal Law §371, p. 291 (rev. 7th ed. 1874). The sources\nprovided in the Apprendi concurrence offer no support, for\nas already discussed, we lack historical evidence about the\ntreatment of facts that altered only the floor of a sentenc-\ning range.\n   Second, the majority observes that “criminal statutes\nhave long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\nranges, which is evidence that both define the legally\nprescribed penalty.” Ante, at 11. Again, though, this\nsimply assumes the core premise: That the constitution-\nally relevant “penalty” involves both the statutory minimum\nand the maximum. Unless one accepts that premise on\nfaith, the fact that statutes have long specified both floor\nand ceiling is evidence of nothing more than that stat-\nutes have long specified both the floor and the ceiling. Nor\ndoes it help to say that “the floor of a mandatory range is\nas relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.” Ante, at 12. The\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on what\nwrongdoers care about most.\n   More importantly, legal rules frequently focus on the\nmaximum sentence while ignoring the minimum, even\nthough both are “relevant” to punishment. Closest to this\ncase, the question whether the jury right applies at all\nturns on whether the maximum sentence exceeds six\nmonths—not, say, whether the minimum punishment\ninvolves time in prison. Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489\nU. S. 538, 543 (1989); see also Lewis v. United States, 518\nU. S. 322, 326 (1996) (“In evaluating the seriousness of the\noffense, we place primary emphasis on the maximum\nprison term authorized”). Likewise, the rights to vote and\nto bear arms are typically denied to felons—that is, those\nconvicted of a crime with a maximum sentence of more\nthan one year in prison. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418\nU. S. 24, 48 (1974); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554\nU. S. 570, 626 (2008); Black’s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n2009). Examples of other distinctions turning only on max-\nimum penalties abound, as in cases of recidivism en-\nhancements that apply only to prior convictions with a\nmaximum sentence of more than a specified number of\nyears. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2). That a minimum\nsentence is “relevant” to punishment, and that a statute\ndefines it, does not mean it must be treated the same as\nthe maximum sentence the law allows.\n   Third, the majority offers that “it is impossible to dis-\npute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor\naggravate the punishment.” Ante, at 12. This argument\nproves too much, for it would apply with equal force to any\nfact which leads the judge, in the exercise of his own dis-\ncretion, to choose a penalty higher than he otherwise\nwould have chosen. The majority nowhere explains what\nit is about the jury right that bars a determination by\nCongress that brandishing (or any other fact) makes an\noffense worth two extra years, but not an identical deter-\nmination by a judge. Simply calling one “aggravation” and\nthe other “discretion” does not do the trick.\n   Fourth, the majority argues that “[i]t is no answer to say\nthat the defendant could have received the same sentence\nwith or without” a particular factual finding, pointing out\n“that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for\nassault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if\nthe punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.”\nAnte, at 14. In that hypothetical case, the legislature has\nchosen to define two crimes with two different sets of\nelements. Courts must, of course, respect that legislative\njudgment. But that tells us nothing about when courts\ncan override the legislature’s decision not to create sepa-\nrate crimes, and instead to treat a particular fact as a\ntrigger for a minimum sentence within the already-\nauthorized range.\n10              ALLEYNE v.

Nevertheless, the Court ought to be\nconsistent in its willingness to reconsider precedent. If\nHarris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), and McMil-\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), can be cast aside\nsimply because a majority of this Court now disagrees\nwith them, that same approach may properly be followed\nin future cases. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 358–\n364 (2009) (ALITO, J., dissenting).\n  If the Court is of a mind to reconsider existing prece-\ndent, a prime candidate should be Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U. S. 466 (2000). Although Apprendi purported to rely\non the original understanding of the jury trial right, there\nare strong reasons to question the Court’s analysis on that\npoint. See, e.g., Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence\nEnhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.

First, that line of cases is predicated on a\npurported Sixth Amendment requirement that juries find facts that\nincrease maximum penalties, not mandatory minimums. Accordingly,\nas THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent persuasively explains, ante, at 1–7,\nApprendi and its progeny have no impact on the distinct question\nresolved by Harris, which does not bear on the jury right. Second, the\nApprendi line is now too intellectually incoherent to undermine any\n“contrary” precedents. If the rationale of Apprendi—which, as broadly\nconstrued by the Court in this case, is that “[a]ny fact that, by law,\nincreases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’ that must be submitted\nto the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,” ante, at 1—were\ntaken seriously, discretionary sentencing, as prescribed by 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a), should also be held to violate the Sixth Amendment. But a\nmajority of the Court has not been willing to go where its reasoning\nleads.\n  Nor can it be correct to say that “Harris in no way strengthens the\nforce of stare decisis in this case” because a “ ‘majority of the Court\nexpressly disagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.’ ” Ante, at 3–4\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\n517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996)). Decisions in which no one rationale commands\na majority of the Court—including prominent decisions based on the\nviews of a single Justice—are often thought to have precedential effect.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Regents of Univ.\nof Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 269–272 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).\nAnd, of course, if Harris is not entitled to stare decisis weight, then\nneither is the Court’s opinion in this case. After all, only four Members\nof the Court think that the Court’s holding is the correct reading of\nthe Constitution. See ante, at 1–3 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment).\n  As she concedes, ante, at 4, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurrence is nec-\nessarily selective in its discussion of the factors that the Court has\npreviously found to be relevant to the application of stare decisis. For\nexample, she does not argue—presumably because there is no good\nargument to be made—that Harris and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477\nU. S. 79 (1986) (which provide the framework under which criminal\nprosecutions have been carried out for at least the past 27 years) have\nproved “ ‘unworkable.’ ” Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004)\n(plurality opinion) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\n(1991)). Nor does she contend that “circumstances” outside the Court\n“have changed so radically as to undermine [Harris’] critical factual\nassumptions.” Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 244 (2006) (plurality\nopinion). Indeed, no party or amicus has cited any such circumstances.\n  In short, other than the fact that there are currently five Justices\n4                   ALLEYNE v.

If the opportunity arises in the\nfuture to overrule Apprendi or the present case—both of which presum-\nably involve “procedural rules . . . that do not govern primary conduct\nand do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties,” ante, at 2\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring)—the precedent the Court sets today will be\nrelevant to the issue of stare decisis.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/903985/", "sha1": "ae48d4479e1f2faefde17cbb9a8117aabe8b139b", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-062", "time_retrieved": "2013-06-21T03:52:16.200633"}
