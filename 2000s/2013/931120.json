BALL STATE UNIVERSITY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u2013556.      Argued November 26, 2012\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nUnder Title VII, an employer\u2019s liability for workplace harassment may\n depend on the status of the harasser. If the harassing employee is\n the victim\u2019s co-worker, the employer is liable only if it was negligent\n in controlling working conditions. In cases in which the harasser is a\n \u201csupervisor,\u201d however, different rules apply. If the supervisor\u2019s har-\n assment culminates in a tangible employment action (i.e., \u201ca signifi-\n cant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to\n promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or\n a decision causing a significant change in benefits,\u201d Burlington In-\n dustries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 761), the employer is strictly\n liable. But if no tangible employment action is taken, the employer\n may escape liability by establishing, as an affirmative defense, that\n (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any\n harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to\n take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the\n employer provided. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807;\n Ellerth, supra, at 765.\n    Petitioner Vance, an African-American woman, sued her employer,\n Ball State University (BSU) alleging that a fellow employee, Saundra\n Davis, created a racially hostile work environment in violation of Ti-\n tle VII. The District Court granted summary judgment to BSU. It\n held that BSU was not vicariously liable for Davis\u2019 alleged actions be-\n cause Davis, who could not take tangible employment actions against\n Vance, was not a supervisor. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is a \u201csupervisor\u201d for purposes of vicarious liability\n under Title VII only if he or she is empowered by the employer to\n take tangible employment actions against the victim. Pp. 9\u201330.\n    (a) Petitioner errs in relying on the meaning of \u201csupervisor\u201d in gen-\n2                     VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    eral usage and in other legal contexts because the term has varying\n    meanings both in colloquial usage and in the law. In any event, Con-\n    gress did not use the term \u201csupervisor\u201d in Title VII, and the way to\n    understand the term\u2019s meaning for present purposes is to consider\n    the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured frame-\n    work adopted in Faragher and Ellerth. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) Petitioner misreads Faragher and Ellerth in claiming that those\n    cases support an expansive definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d because, in her\n    view, at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom the\n    Court treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh\n    Circuit\u2019s definition demands. In Ellerth, there was no question that\n    the alleged harasser, who hired and promoted his victim, was a su-\n    pervisor. And in Faragher, the parties never disputed the characteri-\n    zation of the alleged harassers as supervisors, so the question simply\n    was not before the Court. Pp. 14\u201318.\n      (c) The answer to the question presented in this case is implicit in\n    the characteristics of the framework that the Court adopted in\n    Ellerth and Faragher, which draws a sharp line between co-workers\n    and supervisors and implies that the authority to take tangible em-\n    ployment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor.\n    Ellerth, supra, at 762.\n      The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor adopted today is\n    one that can be readily applied. An alleged harasser\u2019s supervisor sta-\n    tus will often be capable of being discerned before (or soon after) liti-\n    gation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law be-\n    fore trial. By contrast, the vagueness of the EEOC\u2019s standard would\n    impede the resolution of the issue before trial, possibly requiring the\n    jury to be instructed on two very different paths of analysis, depend-\n    ing on whether it finds the alleged harasser to be a supervisor or\n    merely a co-worker.\n      This approach will not leave employees unprotected against har-\n    assment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily\n    tasks. In such cases, a victim can prevail simply by showing that the\n    employer was negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and\n    the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority\n    wielded by the harasser is an important factor in determining negli-\n    gence. Pp. 18\u201325.\n      (d) The definition adopted today accounts for the fact that many\n    modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management\n    structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with re-\n    spect to work assignments. Petitioner fears that employers will at-\n    tempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment\n    by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible em-\n    ployment actions, but a broad definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d is not neces-\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

BALL STATE\n\n                UNIVERSITY \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 24, 2013] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  In this case, we decide a question left open in Burlington\nIndustries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Far-\nagher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998), namely, who\nqualifies as a \u201csupervisor\u201d in a case in which an employee\nasserts a Title VII claim for workplace harassment?\n  Under Title VII, an employer\u2019s liability for such har\u00ad\nassment may depend on the status of the harasser. If the\nharassing employee is the victim\u2019s co-worker, the employer\nis liable only if it was negligent in controlling working\nconditions. In cases in which the harasser is a \u201csuper-\nvisor,\u201d however, different rules apply. If the supervisor\u2019s\nharassment culminates in a tangible employment action,\nthe employer is strictly liable. But if no tangible employ\u00ad\nment action is taken, the employer may escape liability by\nestablishing, as an affirmative defense, that (1) the em\u00ad\nployer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\nany harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unrea\u00ad\nsonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or\ncorrective opportunities that the employer provided. Id.,\nat 807; Ellerth, supra, at 765. Under this framework,\n2               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore, it matters whether a harasser is a \u201csupervisor\u201d\nor simply a co-worker.\n   We hold that an employee is a \u201csupervisor\u201d for purposes\nof vicarious liability under Title VII if he or she is empow\u00ad\nered by the employer to take tangible employment actions\nagainst the victim, and we therefore affirm the judgment\nof the Seventh Circuit.\n                              I\n   Maetta Vance, an African-American woman, began\nworking for Ball State University (BSU) in 1989 as a sub\u00ad\nstitute server in the University Banquet and Catering\ndivision of Dining Services. In 1991, BSU promoted Vance\nto a part-time catering assistant position, and in 2007 she\napplied and was selected for a position as a full-time cater\u00ad\ning assistant.\n   Over the course of her employment with BSU, Vance\nlodged numerous complaints of racial discrimination and\nretaliation, but most of those incidents are not at issue\nhere. For present purposes, the only relevant incidents\nconcern Vance\u2019s interactions with a fellow BSU employee,\nSaundra Davis.\n   During the time in question, Davis, a white woman, was\nemployed as a catering specialist in the Banquet and\nCatering division. The parties vigorously dispute the\nprecise nature and scope of Davis\u2019 duties, but they agree\nthat Davis did not have the power to hire, fire, demote,\npromote, transfer, or discipline Vance. See No. 1:06\u2013cv\u2013\n1452\u2013SEB\u2013JMS, 2008 WL 4247836, *12 (SD Ind., Sept.\n10, 2008) (\u201cVance makes no allegations that Ms. Davis\npossessed any such power\u201d); Brief for Petitioner 9\u201311\n(describing Davis\u2019 authority over Vance); Brief for Re\u00ad\nspondent 39 (\u201c[A]ll agree that Davis lacked the author-\nity to take tangible employments [sic] actions against\npetitioner\u201d).\n   In late 2005 and early 2006, Vance filed internal com\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nplaints with BSU and charges with the Equal Employ\u00ad\nment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging racial\nharassment and discrimination, and many of these com\u00ad\nplaints and charges pertained to Davis. 646 F. 3d 461, 467\n(CA7 2011). Vance complained that Davis \u201cgave her a\nhard time at work by glaring at her, slamming pots and\npans around her, and intimidating her.\u201d Ibid. She alleged\nthat she was \u201cleft alone in the kitchen with Davis, who\nsmiled at her\u201d; that Davis \u201cblocked\u201d her on an elevator and\n\u201cstood there with her cart smiling\u201d; and that Davis often\ngave her \u201cweird\u201d looks. Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Vance\u2019s workplace strife persisted despite BSU\u2019s at\u00ad\ntempts to address the problem. As a result, Vance filed\nthis lawsuit in 2006 in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Indiana, claiming, among other\nthings, that she had been subjected to a racially hostile\nwork environment in violation of Title VII. In her com\u00ad\nplaint, she alleged that Davis was her supervisor and that\nBSU was liable for Davis\u2019 creation of a racially hostile\nwork environment. Complaint in No. 1:06\u2013cv\u201301452\u2013\nSEB\u2013TAB (SD Ind., Oct. 3, 2006), Dkt. No. 1, pp. 5\u20136.\n   Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the\nDistrict Court entered summary judgment in favor of\nBSU. 2008 WL 4247836, at *1. The court explained that\nBSU could not be held vicariously liable for Davis\u2019 alleged\nracial harassment because Davis could not \u201c \u2018hire, fire,\ndemote, promote, transfer, or discipline\u2019 \u201d Vance and, as a\nresult, was not Vance\u2019s supervisor under the Seventh\nCircuit\u2019s interpretation of that concept. See id., at *12\n(quoting Hall v. Bodine Elect. Co., 276 F. 3d 345, 355 (CA7\n2002)). The court further held that BSU could not be\nliable in negligence because it responded reasonably to the\nincidents of which it was aware. 2008 WL 4247836, *15.\n   The Seventh Circuit affirmed. 646 F. 3d 461. It ex\u00ad\nplained that, under its settled precedent, supervisor status\n4                VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nrequires \u201c \u2018the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, trans\u00ad\nfer, or discipline an employee.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 470 (quoting Hall,\nsupra, at 355). The court concluded that Davis was not\nVance\u2019s supervisor and thus that Vance could not recover\nfrom BSU unless she could prove negligence. Finding that\nBSU was not negligent with respect to Davis\u2019 conduct, the\ncourt affirmed. 646 F. 3d, at 470\u2013473.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \u201can\nunlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ\u00ad\nment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a)(1). This pro\u00ad\nvision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to\nemployment decisions that have direct economic conse\u00ad\nquences, such as termination, demotion, and pay cuts.\nBut not long after Title VII was enacted, the lower courts\nheld that Title VII also reaches the creation or perpetua\u00ad\ntion of a discriminatory work environment.\n   In the leading case of Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234\n(1971), the Fifth Circuit recognized a cause of action based\non this theory. See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n477 U. S. 57, 65\u201366 (1986) (describing development of\nhostile environment claims based on race). The Rogers\ncourt reasoned that \u201cthe phrase \u2018terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment\u2019 in [Title VII] is an expansive\nconcept which sweeps within its protective ambit the\npractice of creating a working environment heavily\ncharged with ethnic or racial discrimination.\u201d 454 F. 2d,\nat 238. The court observed that \u201c[o]ne can readily envision\nworking environments so heavily polluted with discrimi\u00ad\nnation as to destroy completely the emotional and psy\u00ad\nchological stability of minority group workers.\u201d Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFollowing this decision, the lower courts generally held that\nan employer was liable for a racially hostile work environ-\nment if the employer was negligent, i.e., if the employer\nknew or reasonably should have known about the harass\u00ad\nment but failed to take remedial action. See Ellerth, 524\nU. S., at 768\u2013769 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing cases).\n   When the issue eventually reached this Court, we\nagreed that Title VII prohibits the creation of a hostile\nwork environment. See Meritor, supra, at 64\u201367. In such\ncases, we have held, the plaintiff must show that the work\nenvironment was so pervaded by discrimination that the\nterms and conditions of employment were altered. See,\ne.g., Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21\n(1993).\n                                B\n   Consistent with Rogers, we have held that an employer\nis directly liable for an employee\u2019s unlawful harassment if\nthe employer was negligent with respect to the offensive\nbehavior. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 789. Courts have gen\u00ad\nerally applied this rule to evaluate employer liability when\na co-worker harasses the plaintiff.1\n   In Ellerth and Faragher, however, we held that different\nrules apply where the harassing employee is the plain-\ntiff \u2019s \u201csupervisor.\u201d In those instances, an employer may be\nvicariously liable for its employees\u2019 creation of a hostile\nwork environment. And in identifying the situations in\nwhich such vicarious liability is appropriate, we looked to\nthe Restatement of Agency for guidance. See, e.g., Meri-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Williams v. Waste Management of Ill., 361 F. 3d 1021, 1029\n\n(CA7 2004); McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F. 3d 1103, 1119 (CA9\n2004); Joens v. John Morrell & Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940 (CA8 2004);\nNoviello v. Boston, 398 F. 3d 76, 95 (CA1 2005); Duch v. Jakubek, 588\nF. 3d 757, 762 (CA2 2009); Huston v. Procter & Gamble Paper Prods.\nCorp., 568 F. 3d 100, 104\u2013105 (CA3 2009).\n6                   VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntor, supra, at 72; Ellerth, supra, at 755.\n   Under the Restatement, \u201cmasters\u201d are generally not\nliable for the torts of their \u201cservants\u201d when the torts are\ncommitted outside the scope of the servants\u2019 employment.\nSee 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7219(2), p. 481\n(1957) (Restatement). And because racial and sexual\nharassment are unlikely to fall within the scope of a serv\u00ad\nant\u2019s duties, application of this rule would generally pre\u00ad\nclude employer liability for employee harassment. See\nFaragher, supra, at 793\u2013796; Ellerth, supra, at 757. But\nin Ellerth and Faragher, we held that a provision of the\nRestatement provided the basis for an exception. Section\n219(2)(d) of that Restatement recognizes an exception to\nthe general rule just noted for situations in which the\nservant was \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by the exist\u00ad\nence of the agency relation.\u201d2 Restatement 481; see Far-\nagher, supra, at 802\u2013803; Ellerth, supra, at 760\u2013763.\n   Adapting this concept to the Title VII context, Ellerth\nand Faragher identified two situations in which the aided\u00ad\nin-the-accomplishment rule warrants employer liability\neven in the absence of negligence, and both of these situa\u00ad\ntions involve harassment by a \u201csupervisor\u201d as opposed to a\nco-worker. First, the Court held that an employer is vicar\u00ad\niously liable \u201cwhen a supervisor takes a tangible employ\u00ad\nment action,\u201d Ellerth, supra, at 762; Faragher, supra, at\n790\u2014i.e., \u201ca significant change in employment status, such\nas hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The Restatement (Third) of Agency disposed of this exception to\nliability, explaining that \u201c[t]he purposes likely intended to be met by\nthe \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 basis are satisfied by a more fully elaborat\u00ad\ned treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care\nthat a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through\nemployees and other agents.\u201d 2 Restatement (Third) \u00a77.08, p. 228\n(2005). The parties do not argue that this change undermines our\nholdings in Faragher and Ellerth.\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus\u00ad\ning a significant change in benefits.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at\n761. We explained the reason for this rule as follows:\n\u201cWhen a supervisor makes a tangible employment deci\u00ad\nsion, there is assurance the injury could not have been\ninflicted absent the agency relation. . . . A tangible em\u00ad\nployment decision requires an official act of the enterprise,\na company act. The decision in most cases is documented\nin official company records, and may be subject to review\nby higher level supervisors.\u201d Id., at 761\u2013762. In those\ncircumstances, we said, it is appropriate to hold the em\u00ad\nployer strictly liable. See Faragher, supra, at 807; Ellerth,\nsupra, at 765.\n   Second, Ellerth and Faragher held that, even when\na supervisor\u2019s harassment does not culminate in a tangible\nemployment action, the employer can be vicariously liable\nfor the supervisor\u2019s creation of a hostile work environment\nif the employer is unable to establish an affirmative de\u00ad\nfense.3 We began by noting that \u201ca supervisor\u2019s power\nand authority invests his or her harassing conduct with\na particular threatening character, and in this sense, a\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Faragher  and Ellerth involved hostile environment claims premised\non sexual harassment. Several federal courts of appeals have held that\nFaragher and Ellerth apply to other types of hostile environment\nclaims, including race-based claims. See Spriggs v. Diamond Auto\nGlass, 242 F. 3d 179, 186, n. 9 (CA4 2001) (citing cases reflecting \u201cthe\ndeveloping consensus . . . that the holdings [in Faragher and Ellerth]\napply with equal force to other types of harassment claims under Title\nVII\u201d). But see Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (stat\u00ad\ning that, as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in Ellerth, \u201cemployer liabil\u00ad\nity under Title VII is judged by different standards depending upon\nwhether a sexually or racially hostile work environment is alleged\u201d).\nNeither party in this case challenges the application of Faragher and\nEllerth to race-based hostile environment claims, and we assume that\nthe framework announced in Faragher and Ellerth applies to cases such\nas this one.\n8               VANCE v.

S., at 803\u2013805.\nBut it would go too far, we found, to make employers\nstrictly liable whenever a \u201csupervisor\u201d engages in harass\u00ad\nment that does not result in a tangible employment action,\nand we therefore held that in such cases the employer may\nraise an affirmative defense. Specifically, an employer can\nmitigate or avoid liability by showing (1) that it exercised\nreasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any har\u00ad\nassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably\nfailed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective\nopportunities that were provided. Faragher, supra, at 807;\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765. This compromise, we ex-\nplained, \u201caccommodate[s] the agency principles of vicari\u00ad\nous liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory\nauthority, as well as Title VII\u2019s equally basic policies of\nencouraging forethought by employers and saving action\nby objecting employees.\u201d Id., at 764.\n   The dissenting Members of the Court in Ellerth and\nFaragher would not have created a special rule for cases\ninvolving harassment by \u201csupervisors.\u201d Instead, they\nwould have held that an employer is liable for any em\u00ad\nployee\u2019s creation of a hostile work environment \u201cif, and\nonly if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negli\u00ad\ngent in permitting the [offending] conduct to occur.\u201d\nEllerth, supra, at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Faragher,\nsupra, at 810 (same).\n                             C\n  Under Ellerth and Faragher, it is obviously important\nwhether an alleged harasser is a \u201csupervisor\u201d or merely a\nco-worker, and the lower courts have disagreed about the\nmeaning of the concept of a supervisor in this context.\nSome courts, including the Seventh Circuit below, have\nheld that an employee is not a supervisor unless he or she\nhas the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Other\ncourts have substantially followed the more open-ended\napproach advocated by the EEOC\u2019s Enforcement Guid\u00ad\nance, which ties supervisor status to the ability to exercise\nsignificant direction over another\u2019s daily work. See, e.g.,\nMack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 126\u2013127 (CA2\n2003); Whitten v. Fred\u2019s, Inc., 601 F. 3d 231, 245\u2013247 (CA4\n2010); EEOC, Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer\nLiability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (1999),\n1999 WL 33305874, *3 (hereinafter EEOC Guidance).\n   We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 567 U.

We reject\nthe nebulous definition of a \u201csupervisor\u201d advocated in the\nEEOC Guidance4 and substantially adopted by several\ncourts of appeals.

Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 26\u201329 (citing Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)). But to do so would be proper only if the\nEEOC Guidance has the power to persuade, which \u201cdepend[s] upon the\nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning,\n[and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.\u201d Id., at\n140. For the reasons explained below, we do not find the EEOC Guid\u00ad\nance persuasive.\n10              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the term \u201csupervisor\u201d is misplaced, and her contention\nthat our cases require the EEOC\u2019s abstract definition is\nsimply wrong.\n   As we will explain, the framework set out in Ellerth and\nFaragher presupposes a clear distinction between supervi\u00ad\nsors and co-workers. Those decisions contemplate a uni\u00ad\ntary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the\nauthority to make tangible employment decisions. There\nis no hint in either decision that the Court had in mind\ntwo categories of supervisors: first, those who have such\nauthority and, second, those who, although lacking this\npower, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker\u2019s\nlabor to some ill-defined degree. On the contrary, the\nEllerth/Faragher framework is one under which supervi\u00ad\nsory status can usually be readily determined, generally\nby written documentation. The approach recommended by\nthe EEOC Guidance, by contrast, would make the deter\u00ad\nmination of supervisor status depend on a highly case\u00ad\nspecific evaluation of numerous factors.\n  The Ellerth/Faragher framework represents what the\nCourt saw as a workable compromise between the aided\u00ad\nin-the-accomplishment theory of vicarious liability and the\nlegitimate interests of employers. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nunderstanding of the concept of a \u201csupervisor,\u201d with which\nwe agree, is easily workable; it can be applied without\nundue difficulty at both the summary judgment stage and\nat trial. The alternative, in many cases, would frustrate\njudges and confound jurors.\n                             A\n  Petitioner contends that her expansive understanding of\nthe concept of a \u201csupervisor\u201d is supported by the meaning\nof the word in general usage and in other legal contexts,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 25\u201328, but this argument is both\nincorrect on its own terms and, in any event, misguided.\n  In general usage, the term \u201csupervisor\u201d lacks a suffi\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nciently specific meaning to be helpful for present purposes.\nPetitioner is certainly right that the term is often used to\nrefer to a person who has the authority to direct another\u2019s\nwork. See, e.g., 17 Oxford English Dictionary 245 (2d ed.\n1989) (defining the term as applying to \u201cone who inspects\nand directs the work of others\u201d). But the term is also\noften closely tied to the authority to take what Ellerth\nand Faragher referred to as a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d\nSee, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2296, def. 1(a) (1976) (\u201ca person having authority dele-\ngated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall,\npromote, assign, or discharge another employee or to rec-\nommend such action\u201d).\n   A comparison of the definitions provided by two collo\u00ad\nquial business authorities illustrates the term\u2019s impreci\u00ad\nsion in general usage. One says that \u201c[s]upervisors are\nusually authorized to recommend and/or effect hiring,\ndisciplining, promoting, punishing, rewarding, and other\nassociated activities regarding the employees in their\ndepartments.\u201d5 Another says exactly the opposite: \u201cA\nsupervisor generally does not have the power to hire or\nfire employees or to promote them.\u201d6 Compare Ellerth,\n524 U. S., at 762 (\u201cTangible employment actions fall with\u00ad\nin the special province of the supervisor\u201d).\n   If we look beyond general usage to the meaning of the\nterm in other legal contexts, we find much the same situa\u00ad\ntion. Sometimes the term is reserved for those in the\nupper echelons of the management hierarchy. See, e.g., 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72021(18) (defining the \u201csupervisor\u201d of a school\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/supervisor.html (all In-\n\nternet materials as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).\n  6 http://management.about.com/od/policiesandprocedures/g/\n\nsupervisor1.html\n12                   VANCE v.

But sometimes the term is used to refer\nto lower ranking individuals.        See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7152(11) (defining a supervisor to include \u201cany individual\nhaving authority . . . to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off,\nrecall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline\nother employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust\ntheir grievances, or effectively to recommend such action,\nif in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such\nauthority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature,\nbut requires the use of independent judgment\u201d); 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396n(j)(4)(A) (providing that an eligible Medicaid\nbeneficiary who receives care through an approved self\u00ad\ndirected services plan may \u201chire, fire, supervise, and man\u00ad\nage the individuals providing such services\u201d).\n   Although the meaning of the concept of a supervisor\nvaries from one legal context to another, the law often\ncontemplates that the ability to supervise includes the\nability to take tangible employment actions.7 See, e.g., 5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 One outlier that petitioner points to is the National Labor Relations\n\nAct (NLRA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7152(11). Petitioner argues that the NLRA\u2019s\ndefinition supports her position in this case to the extent that it encom\u00ad\npasses employees who have the ability to direct or assign work to\nsubordinates. Brief for Petitioner 27\u201328.\n   The NLRA certainly appears to define \u201csupervisor\u201d in broad terms.\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the lower courts,\nhowever, have consistently explained that supervisory authority is not\ntrivial or insignificant: If the term \u201csupervisor\u201d is construed too broadly,\nthen employees who are deemed to be supervisors will be denied rights\nthat the NLRA was intended to protect. E.g., In re Connecticut Hu-\nmane Society, 358 NLRB No. 31, *33 (Apr. 12, 2012); Frenchtown\nAcquisition Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 683 F. 3d 298, 305 (CA6 2012); Beverly\nEnterprises-Massachusetts, Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F. 3d 960, 963 (CADC\n1999). Indeed, in defining a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA,\nCongress sought to distinguish \u201cbetween straw bosses, leadmen, set-up\nmen, and other minor supervisory employees, on the one hand, and the\nsupervisor vested with such genuine management prerogatives as the\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCFR \u00a7\u00a79701.511(a)(2), (3) (2012) (referring to a supervi\u00ad\nsor\u2019s authority to \u201chire, assign, and direct employees . . .\nand [t]o lay off and retain employees, or to suspend, re-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nright to hire or fire, discipline, or make effective recommendations with\nrespect to such action.\u201d S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1947).\nCf. NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U. S. 571,\n586 (1994) (HCRA) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (\u201cThrough case-by-case\nadjudication, the Board has sought to distinguish individuals exercising\nthe level of control that truly places them in the ranks of management,\nfrom highly skilled employees, whether professional or technical, who\nperform, incidentally to their skilled work, a limited supervisory role\u201d).\nAccordingly, the NLRB has interpreted the NLRA\u2019s statutory definition\nof supervisor more narrowly than its plain language might permit. See,\ne.g., Connecticut Humane Society, supra, at *39 (an employee who\nevaluates others is not a supervisor unless the evaluation \u201caffect[s] the\nwages and the job status of the employee evaluated\u201d); In re CGLM, Inc.,\n350 NLRB 974, 977 (2007) (\u201c \u2018If any authority over someone else, no\nmatter how insignificant or infrequent, made an employee a super-\nvisor, our industrial composite would be predominantly supervisory.\nEvery order-giver is not a supervisor. Even the traffic director tells the\npresident of the company where to park his car\u2019 \u201d (quoting NLRB v.\nSecurity Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F. 2d 143, 151 (CA5 1967))). The NLRA\ntherefore does not define the term \u201csupervisor\u201d as broadly as petitioner\nsuggests.\n   To be sure, the NLRA may in some instances define \u201csupervisor\u201d\nmore broadly than we define the term in this case. But those differ\u00ad\nences reflect the NLRA\u2019s unique purpose, which is to preserve the\nbalance of power between labor and management, see HCRA, supra, at\n573 (explaining that Congress amended the NLRA to exclude supervi\u00ad\nsors in order to address the \u201cimbalance between labor and manage\u00ad\nment\u201d that resulted when \u201csupervisory employees could organize as\npart of bargaining units and negotiate with the employer\u201d). That\npurpose is inapposite in the context of Title VII, which focuses on\neradicating discrimination. An employee may have a sufficient degree\nof authority over subordinates such that Congress has decided that the\nemployee should not participate with lower level employees in the same\ncollective-bargaining unit (because, for example, a higher level employ\u00ad\nee will pursue his own interests at the expense of lower level employees\u2019\ninterests), but that authority is not necessarily sufficient to merit\nheightened liability for the purposes of Title VII. The NLRA\u2019s defini\u00ad\ntion of supervisor therefore is not controlling in this context.\n14              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmove, reduce in grade, band, or pay, or take other discipli\u00ad\nnary action against such employees or, with respect to\nfilling positions, to make selections for appointments from\nproperly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or\nfrom any other appropriate source\u201d); \u00a79701.212(b)(4) (de\u00ad\nfining \u201csupervisory work\u201d as that which \u201cmay involve\nhiring or selecting employees, assigning work, managing\nperformance, recognizing and rewarding employees, and\nother associated duties\u201d).\n   In sum, the term \u201csupervisor\u201d has varying meanings\nboth in colloquial usage and in the law. And for this\nreason, petitioner\u2019s argument, taken on its own terms, is\nunsuccessful.\n   More important, petitioner is misguided in suggesting\nthat we should approach the question presented here as if\n\u201csupervisor\u201d were a statutory term. \u201cSupervisor\u201d is not a\nterm used by Congress in Title VII. Rather, the term was\nadopted by this Court in Ellerth and Faragher as a label\nfor the class of employees whose misconduct may give\nrise to vicarious employer liability. Accordingly, the way\nto understand the meaning of the term \u201csupervisor\u201d for\npresent purposes is to consider the interpretation that\nbest fits within the highly structured framework that\nthose cases adopted.\n                             B\n  In considering Ellerth and Faragher, we are met at the\noutset with petitioner\u2019s contention that at least some of\nthe alleged harassers in those cases, whom we treated as\nsupervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s definition demands. This argument misreads our\ndecisions.\n  In Ellerth, it was clear that the alleged harasser was a\nsupervisor under any definition of the term: He hired his\nvictim, and he promoted her (subject only to the minis-\nterial approval of his supervisor, who merely signed the\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Ellerth was a case from\nthe Seventh Circuit, and at the time of its decision in that\ncase, that court had already adopted its current definition\nof a supervisor. See Volk v. Coler, 845 F. 2d 1422, 1436\n(1988). See also Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc.,\n163 F. 3d 1027, 1033, n. 1 (CA7 1998) (discussing Circuit\ncase law). Although the en banc Seventh Circuit in\nEllerth issued eight separate opinions, there was no disa\u00ad\ngreement about the harasser\u2019s status as a supervisor.\nJansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F. 3d 490\n(1997) (per curiam). Likewise, when the case reached this\nCourt, no question about the harasser\u2019s status was raised.\n   The same is true with respect to Faragher. In that case,\nFaragher, a female lifeguard, sued her employer, the city\nof Boca Raton, for sexual harassment based on the conduct\nof two other lifeguards, Bill Terry and David Silverman,\nand we held that the city was vicariously liable for Terry\u2019s\nand Silverman\u2019s harassment. Although it is clear that\nTerry had authority to take tangible employment actions\naffecting the victim,8 see 524 U. S., at 781 (explaining that\nTerry could hire new lifeguards, supervise their work\nassignments, counsel, and discipline them), Silverman\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent suggests that it is unclear whether Terry would qualify\n\nas a supervisor under the test we adopt because his hiring decisions\nwere subject to approval by higher management. Post, at 7, n. 1 (opin\u00ad\nion of GINSBURG, J.). See also Faragher, 524 U. S., at 781. But we have\nassumed that tangible employment actions can be subject to such\napproval. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. In any event, the record\nindicates that Terry possessed the power to make employment deci\u00ad\nsions having direct economic consequences for his victims. See Brief for\nPetitioner in Faragher v. Boca Raton, O. T. 1997, No. 97\u2013282, p. 9 (\u201cNo\none, during the twenty years that Terry was Marine Safety Chief, was\nhired without his recommendation.

Nevertheless, the city never disputed Far\u00ad\nagher\u2019s characterization of both men as her \u201csupervisors.\u201d\nSee App., O. T. 1997, No. 97\u2013282, p. 40 (First Amended\nComplaint \u00b6\u00b66\u20137); id., at 79 (Answer to First Amended\nComplaint \u00b6\u00b66\u20137) (admitting that both harassers had\n\u201csupervisory responsibilities\u201d over the plaintiff).9\n  In light of the parties\u2019 undisputed characterization of\nthe alleged harassers, this Court simply was not presented\nwith the question of the degree of authority that an em\u00ad\nployee must have in order to be classified as a supervi\u00ad\nsor.10 The parties did not focus on the issue in their briefs,\nalthough the victim in Faragher appears to have agreed\nthat supervisors are employees empowered to take tangi\u00ad\nble employment actions. See Brief for Petitioner, O. T.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Moreover,   it is by no means certain that Silverman lacked the au\u00ad\nthority to take tangible employment actions against Faragher. In her\nmerits brief, Faragher stated that, as a lieutenant, Silverman \u201cmade\nsupervisory and disciplinary decisions and had input on the evaluations\nas well.\u201d Id., at 9\u201310. If that discipline had economic consequences\n(such as suspension without pay), then Silverman might qualify as a\nsupervisor under the definition we adopt today.\n   Silverman\u2019s ability to assign Faragher significantly different work\nresponsibilities also may have constituted a tangible employment\naction. Silverman told Faragher, \u201c \u2018Date me or clean the toilets for a\nyear.\u2019 \u201d Faragher, supra, at 780. That threatened reassignment of\nduties likely would have constituted significantly different responsibili\u00ad\nties for a lifeguard, whose job typically is to guard the beach. If that\nreassignment had economic consequences, such as foreclosing Far-\nagher\u2019s eligibility for promotion, then it might constitute a tangible\nemployment action.\n   10 The lower court did not even address this issue. See Faragher v.\n\nBoca Raton, 111 F. 3d 1530, 1547 (CA11 1997) (Anderson, J., concur\u00ad\nring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that it was unnecessary to\n\u201cdecide the threshold level of authority which a supervisor must possess\nin order to impose liability on the employer\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

As the dissent implicitly acknowledges, the supervi\u00ad\nsor status of the harassing employees was not before us in that case.\nSee post, at 8. Indeed, the employer conceded early in the litigation\nthat the relevant employees were supervisors, App. in Pennsylvania\nState Police v. Suders, O. T. 2003, No. 03\u201395, p. 20 (Answer \u00b629),\nand we therefore had no occasion to question that unchallenged\ncharacterization.\n18              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply not sufficient. Employees with such powers are\ncertainly capable of creating intolerable work environ\u00ad\nments, see post, at 9\u201311 (discussing examples), but so are\nmany other co-workers. Negligence provides the better\nframework for evaluating an employer\u2019s liability when a\nharassing employee lacks the power to take tangible em\u00ad\nployment actions.\n                               C\n   Although our holdings in Faragher and Ellerth do not\nresolve the question now before us, we believe that the\nanswer to that question is implicit in the characteristics of\nthe framework that we adopted.\n   To begin, there is no hint in either Ellerth or Faragher\nthat the Court contemplated anything other than a uni\u00ad\ntary category of supervisors, namely, those possessing the\nauthority to effect a tangible change in a victim\u2019s terms or\nconditions of employment. The Ellerth/Faragher framework\ndraws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors.\nCo-workers, the Court noted, \u201ccan inflict psychologi-\ncal injuries\u201d by creating a hostile work environment, but\nthey \u201ccannot dock another\u2019s pay, nor can one co-worker\ndemote another.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Only a su\u00ad\npervisor has the power to cause \u201cdirect economic harm\u201d by\ntaking a tangible employment action. Ibid. \u201cTangible\nemployment actions fall within the special province of the\nsupervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the\ncompany as a distinct class of agent to make economic\ndecisions affecting other employees under his or her con\u00ad\ntrol. . . . Tangible employment actions are the means by\nwhich the supervisor brings the official power of the en\u00ad\nterprise to bear on subordinates.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThe strong implication of this passage is that the authori\u00ad\nty to take tangible employment actions is the defining\ncharacteristic of a supervisor, not simply a characteristic\nof a subset of an ill-defined class of employees who qualify\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas supervisors.\n   The way in which we framed the question presented\nin Ellerth supports this understanding. As noted, the\nEllerth/Faragher framework sets out two circumstances\nin which an employer may be vicariously liable for a su\u00ad\npervisor\u2019s harassment. The first situation (which results\nin strict liability) exists when a supervisor actually takes\na tangible employment action based on, for example, a\nsubordinate\u2019s refusal to accede to sexual demands. The\nsecond situation (which results in vicarious liability if the\nemployer cannot make out the requisite affirmative de\u00ad\nfense) is present when no such tangible action is taken.\nBoth Ellerth and Faragher fell into the second category,\nand in Ellerth, the Court couched the question at issue in\nthe following terms: \u201cwhether an employer has vicarious\nliability when a supervisor creates a hostile work en-\nvironment by making explicit threats to alter a subor\u00ad\ndinate\u2019s terms or conditions of employment, based on sex,\nbut does not fulfill the threat.\u201d 524 U. S., at 754. This\nstatement plainly ties the second situation to a supervi\u00ad\nsor\u2019s authority to inflict direct economic injury. It is be\u00ad\ncause a supervisor has that authority\u2014and its potential\nuse hangs as a threat over the victim\u2014that vicarious\nliability (subject to the affirmative defense) is justified.\n   Finally, the Ellerth/Faragher Court sought a frame\u00ad\nwork that would be workable and would appropriately\ntake into account the legitimate interests of employers and\nemployees. The Court looked to principles of agency law\nfor guidance, but the Court concluded that the \u201cmalleable\nterminology\u201d of the aided-in-the-commission principle\ncounseled against the wholesale incorporation of that\nprinciple into Title VII case law. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763.\nInstead, the Court also considered the objectives of Title\nVII, including \u201cthe limitation of employer liability in cer\u00ad\ntain circumstances.\u201d Id., at 764.\n   The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we\n20                 VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nadopt today is one that can be readily applied. In a great\nmany cases, it will be known even before litigation is\ncommenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervi\u00ad\nsor, and in others, the alleged harasser\u2019s status will be\u00ad\ncome clear to both sides after discovery. And once this is\nknown, the parties will be in a position to assess the\nstrength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolv\u00ad\ning the dispute. Where this does not occur, supervisor\nstatus will generally be capable of resolution at summary\njudgment. By contrast, under the approach advocated by\npetitioner and the EEOC, supervisor status would very\noften be murky\u2014as this case well illustrates.12\n   According to petitioner, the record shows that Davis, her\nalleged harasser, wielded enough authority to qualify as a\nsupervisor. Petitioner points in particular to Davis\u2019 job\ndescription, which gave her leadership responsibilities,\nand to evidence that Davis at times led or directed Vance\nand other employees in the kitchen. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 42\u201343 (citing record); Reply Brief 22\u201323 (same).\nThe United States, on the other hand, while applying the\nsame open-ended test for supervisory status, reaches the\nopposite conclusion. At least on the present record, the\nUnited States tells us, Davis fails to qualify as a supervi\u00ad\nsor. Her job description, in the Government\u2019s view, is not\ndispositive, and the Government adds that it would not be\nenough for petitioner to show that Davis \u201coccasionally took\nthe lead in the kitchen.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31 (U. S. Brief).\n   This disagreement is hardly surprising since the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 The dissent attempts to find ambiguities in our holding, see post,\n\nat 15\u201316, and n. 5, but it is indisputable that our holding is orders of\nmagnitude clearer than the nebulous standard it would adopt. Em\u00ad\nployment discrimination cases present an almost unlimited number\nof factual variations, and marginal cases are inevitable under any\nstandard.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nEEOC\u2019s definition of a supervisor, which both petitioner\nand the United States defend, is a study in ambiguity. In\nits Enforcement Guidance, the EEOC takes the position\nthat an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor,\nmust wield authority \u201c \u2018of sufficient magnitude so as to as\u00ad\nsist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out\nthe harassment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 27 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert.\n89a (EEOC Guidance)). But any authority over the work\nof another employee provides at least some assistance, see\nEllerth, supra, at 763, and that is not what the United\nStates interprets the Guidance to mean. Rather, it in\u00ad\nforms us, the authority must exceed both an ill-defined\ntemporal requirement (it must be more than \u201cocca\u00ad\nsiona[l]\u201d) and an ill-defined substantive requirement (\u201can\nemployee who directs \u2018only a limited number of tasks or\nassignments\u2019 for another employee . . . would not have\nsufficient authority to qualify as a supervisor.\u201d U. S. Brief\n28 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance));\nU. S. Brief 31.\n   We read the EEOC Guidance as saying that the number\n(and perhaps the importance) of the tasks in question is a\nfactor to be considered in determining whether an employ\u00ad\nee qualifies as a supervisor. And if this is a correct inter\u00ad\npretation of the EEOC\u2019s position, what we are left with is\na proposed standard of remarkable ambiguity.\n   The vagueness of this standard was highlighted at oral\nargument when the attorney representing the United\nStates was asked to apply that standard to the situation in\nFaragher, where the alleged harasser supposedly threat\u00ad\nened to assign the plaintiff to clean the toilets in the life\u00ad\nguard station for a year if she did not date him. 524 U. S.,\nat 780. Since cleaning the toilets is just one task, albeit an\nunpleasant one, the authority to assign that job would not\nseem to meet the more-than-a-limited-number-of-tasks\nrequirement in the EEOC Guidance. Nevertheless, the\nGovernment attorney\u2019s first response was that the author\u00ad\n22              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nity to make this assignment would be enough. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 23. He later qualified that answer by saying that it\nwould be necessary to \u201cknow how much of the day\u2019s work\n[was] encompassed by cleaning the toilets.\u201d Id., at 23\u201324.\nHe did not explain what percentage of the day\u2019s work\n(50%, 25%, 10%?) would suffice.\n   The Government attorney\u2019s inability to provide a de-\nfinitive answer to this question was the inevitable con-\nsequence of the vague standard that the Government\nasks us to adopt. Key components of that standard\u2014\n\u201csufficient\u201d authority, authority to assign more than a\n\u201climited number of tasks,\u201d and authority that is exercised\nmore than \u201coccasionally\u201d\u2014have no clear meaning. Apply\u00ad\ning these standards would present daunting problems for\nthe lower federal courts and for juries.\n   Under the definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d that we adopt to\u00ad\nday, the question of supervisor status, when contested, can\nvery often be resolved as a matter of law before trial. The\nelimination of this issue from the trial will focus the ef\u00ad\nforts of the parties, who will be able to present their cases\nin a way that conforms to the framework that the jury will\napply. The plaintiff will know whether he or she must\nprove that the employer was negligent or whether the\nemployer will have the burden of proving the elements of\nthe Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. Perhaps even\nmore important, the work of the jury, which is inevitably\ncomplicated in employment discrimination cases, will be\nsimplified. The jurors can be given preliminary instruc\u00ad\ntions that allow them to understand, as the evidence\ncomes in, how each item of proof fits into the framework\nthat they will ultimately be required to apply. And even\nwhere the issue of supervisor status cannot be eliminated\nfrom the trial (because there are genuine factual disputes\nabout an alleged harasser\u2019s authority to take tangible\nemployment actions), this preliminary question is rela-\ntively straightforward.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   23\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   The alternative approach advocated by petitioner and\nthe United States would make matters far more compli\u00ad\ncated and difficult. The complexity of the standard they\nfavor would impede the resolution of the issue before trial.\nWith the issue still open when trial commences, the par\u00ad\nties would be compelled to present evidence and argu\u00ad\nment on supervisor status, the affirmative defense, and the\nquestion of negligence, and the jury would have to grapple\nwith all those issues as well. In addition, it would often be\nnecessary for the jury to be instructed about two very\ndifferent paths of analysis, i.e., what to do if the alleged\nharasser was found to be a supervisor and what to do if\nthe alleged harasser was found to be merely a co-worker.\n   Courts and commentators alike have opined on the need\nfor reasonably clear jury instructions in employment\ndiscrimination cases.13 And the danger of juror confusion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See, e.g., Gross v.

The nature and degree of authority possessed by\nharassing employees varies greatly, see post, 9\u201311 (offer\u00ad\ning examples), and as we explained above, the test pro\u00ad\nposed by petitioner and the United States is ill equipped to\ndeal with the variety of situations that will inevitably\narise. This variety presents no problem for the negligence\nstandard, which is thought to provide adequate protection\nfor tort plaintiffs in many other situations. There is no\nreason why this standard, if accompanied by proper in\u00ad\nstructions, cannot provide the same service in the context\nat issue here.\n                              D\n   The dissent argues that the definition of a supervisor\nthat we now adopt is out of touch with the realities of\nthe workplace, where individuals with the power to assign\ndaily tasks are often regarded by other employees as\nsupervisors. See post, at 5, 8\u201312. But in reality it is the\nalternative that is out of touch. Particularly in modern\norganizations that have abandoned a highly hierarchical\nmanagement structure, it is common for employees to\nhave overlapping authority with respect to the assignment\nof work tasks. Members of a team may each have the\nresponsibility for taking the lead with respect to a particu\u00ad\nlar aspect of the work and thus may have the responsibil\u00ad\nity to direct each other in that area of responsibility.\n   Finally, petitioner argues that tying supervisor status to\nthe authority to take tangible employment actions will\nencourage employers to attempt to insulate themselves\nfrom liability for workplace harassment by empowering\nonly a handful of individuals to take tangible employment\nactions. But a broad definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d is not nec\u00ad\nessary to guard against this concern.\n   As an initial matter, an employer will always be liable\nwhen its negligence leads to the creation or continuation of\n26              VANCE v.

And even if an employer\nconcentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few indi\u00ad\nviduals, it likely will not isolate itself from heightened\nliability under Faragher and Ellerth. If an employer does\nattempt to confine decisionmaking power to a small num\u00ad\nber of individuals, those individuals will have a limited\nability to exercise independent discretion when making\ndecisions and will likely rely on other workers who actu-\nally interact with the affected employee.

Under those circumstances, the employer may\nbe held to have effectively delegated the power to take\ntangible employment actions to the employees on whose\nrecommendations it relies.

But before it had an opportunity to\nmake any such determination, Mack withdrew her complaint and the\nDistrict Court dismissed her claims with prejudice. See Stipulation\nand Order of Dismissal in No. 1:00\u2013cv\u20137778\u2013LAP (SDNY, Oct. 21,\n2004), Dkt. No. 63.\n  16 Starke herself lacked standing to pursue her claims, see EEOC v.\n\nCRST Van Expedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 678, and n. 14 (CA8 2012),\nbut the Eighth Circuit held that the EEOC could sue in its own name to\nremedy the sexual harassment against Starke and other CRST employ\u00ad\nees, see id., at 682.\n28               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nFeb. 2, 2013), Dkt. No. 380, Exh. 1, \u00b61, notwithstanding\nthe fact that the court in that case applied the definition of\n\u201csupervisor\u201d that we adopt today, see EEOC v. CRST Van\nExpedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 684 (CA8 2012).\n   In any event, the dissent is wrong in claiming that our\nholding would preclude employer liability in other cases\nwith facts similar to these. Assuming that a harasser is\nnot a supervisor, a plaintiff could still prevail by showing\nthat his or her employer was negligent in failing to pre\u00ad\nvent harassment from taking place. Evidence that an\nemployer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond\nto complaints, failed to provide a system for registering\ncomplaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from\nbeing filed would be relevant. Thus, it is not true, as the\ndissent asserts, that our holding \u201crelieves scores of em\u00ad\nployers of responsibility\u201d for the behavior of workers they\nemploy. Post, at 14.\n   The standard we adopt is not untested. It has been the\nlaw for quite some time in the First, Seventh, and Eighth\nCircuits, see, e.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398 F. 3d 76, 96 (CA1\n2005); Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp., 359 F. 3d 1049,\n1057 (CA8 2004); Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc.,\n163 F. 3d 1027, 1033\u20131034, and n. 1 (CA7 1998)\u2014i.e., in\nArkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North\nDakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. We\nare aware of no evidence that this rule has produced dire\nconsequences in these 14 jurisdictions.\n   Despite its rhetoric, the dissent acknowledges that\nDavis, the alleged harasser in this case, would probably\nnot qualify as a supervisor even under the dissent\u2019s pre\u00ad\nferred approach. See post, at 20 (\u201c[T]here is cause to\nanticipate that Davis would not qualify as Vance\u2019s super\u00ad\nvisor\u201d). On that point, we agree. Petitioner did refer to\nDavis as a \u201csupervisor\u201d in some of the complaints that she\nfiled, App. 28; id., at 45, and Davis\u2019 job description does\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But under the dissent\u2019s preferred approach,\nsupervisor status hinges not on formal job titles or \u201cpaper\ndescriptions\u201d but on \u201cspecific facts about the working\nrelationship.\u201d Post, at 20\u201321 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n   Turning to the \u201cspecific facts\u201d of petitioner\u2019s and Davis\u2019\nworking relationship, there is simply no evidence that\nDavis directed petitioner\u2019s day-to-day activities. The record\nindicates that Bill Kimes (the general manager of the\nCatering Division) and the chef assigned petitioner\u2019s\ndaily tasks, which were given to her on \u201cprep lists.\u201d No.\n1:06\u2013cv\u20131452\u2013SEB\u2013JMS, 2008 WL 4247836, *7 (SD Ind.,\nSept. 10, 2008); App. 430, 431. The fact that Davis some\u00ad\ntimes may have handed prep lists to petitioner, see id., at\n74, is insufficient to confer supervisor status, see App. to\nPet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance). And Kimes\u2014not\nDavis\u2014set petitioner\u2019s work schedule. See App. 431. See\nalso id., at 212.\n   Because the dissent concedes that our approach in this\ncase deprives petitioner of none of the protections that Ti-\ntle VII offers, the dissent\u2019s critique is based on nothing\nmore than a hypothesis as to how our approach might\naffect the outcomes of other cases\u2014cases where an em\u00ad\nployee who cannot take tangible employment actions, but\nwho does direct the victim\u2019s daily work activities in a\nmeaningful way, creates an unlawful hostile environment,\nand yet does not wield authority of such a degree and\nnature that the employer can be deemed negligent with\nrespect to the harassment. We are skeptical that there\nare a great number of such cases. However, we are confi\u00ad\ndent that, in every case, the approach we take today will\nbe more easily administrable than the approach advocated\nby the dissent.\n30               VANCE v.

Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998), and\nBurlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998),\nthis Court held that an employer can be vicariously liable\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for harass-\nment by an employee given supervisory authority over\nsubordinates. In line with those decisions, in 1999, the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nprovided enforcement guidance \u201cregarding employer liabil-\nity for harassment by supervisors based on sex, race, color,\nreligion, national origin, age, disability, or protected activ-\nity.\u201d EEOC, Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability\nFor Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, 8 BNA FEP\nManual 405:7651 (Feb. 2003) (hereinafter EEOC Guid-\nance). Addressing who qualifies as a supervisor, the\nEEOC answered: (1) an individual authorized \u201cto under-\ntake or recommend tangible employment decisions affect-\ning the employee,\u201d including \u201chiring, firing, promoting,\ndemoting, and reassigning the employee\u201d; or (2) an indi-\nvidual authorized \u201cto direct the employee\u2019s daily work\nactivities.\u201d Id., at 405:7654.\n   The Court today strikes from the supervisory category\nemployees who control the day-to-day schedules and as-\nsignments of others, confining the category to those for-\n2                VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nmally empowered to take tangible employment actions.\nThe limitation the Court decrees diminishes the force of\nFaragher and Ellerth, ignores the conditions under which\nmembers of the work force labor, and disserves the objec-\ntive of Title VII to prevent discrimination from infecting\nthe Nation\u2019s workplaces. I would follow the EEOC\u2019s Guid-\nance and hold that the authority to direct an employee\u2019s\ndaily activities establishes supervisory status under Title\nVII.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Title VII makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for\nan employer\u201d to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with\nrespect to\u201d the \u201cterms, conditions, or privileges of employ-\nment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a72000e\u20132(a). The creation\nof a hostile work environment through harassment, this\nCourt has long recognized, is a form of proscribed discrim-\nination. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523\nU. S. 75, 78 (1998); Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n477 U. S. 57, 64\u201365 (1986).\n   What qualifies as harassment? Title VII imposes no\n\u201cgeneral civility code.\u201d Oncale, 523 U. S., at 81. It does\nnot reach \u201cthe ordinary tribulations of the workplace,\u201d for\nexample, \u201csporadic use of abusive language\u201d or generally\nboorish conduct. B. Lindemann & D.

To be actionable, charged behavior need not\ndrive the victim from her job, but it must be of such sever-\nity or pervasiveness as to pollute the working environment,\nthereby \u201calter[ing] the conditions of the victim\u2019s employ-\nment.\u201d Harris v.

S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   In Faragher and Ellerth, this Court established a\nframework for determining when an employer may be held\nliable for its employees\u2019 creation of a hostile work envi-\nronment. Recognizing that Title VII\u2019s definition of \u201cem-\nployer\u201d includes an employer\u2019s \u201cagent[s],\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e(b), the Court looked to agency law for guidance in\nformulating liability standards. Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n791, 801; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 755\u2013760. In particular, the\nCourt drew upon \u00a7219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of\nAgency (1957), which makes an employer liable for the\nconduct of an employee, even when that employee acts\nbeyond the scope of her employment, if the employee is\n\u201caided in accomplishing\u201d a tort \u201cby the existence of the\nagency relation.\u201d See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801; Ellerth,\n524 U. S., at 758.\n   Stemming from that guide, Faragher and Ellerth distin-\nguished between harassment perpetrated by supervisors,\nwhich is often enabled by the supervisor\u2019s agency relation-\nship with the employer, and harassment perpetrated by\nco-workers, which is not similarly facilitated. Faragher,\n524 U. S., at 801\u2013803; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763\u2013765. If\nthe harassing employee is a supervisor, the Court held,\nthe employer is vicariously liable whenever the harass-\nment culminates in a tangible employment action. Far-\nagher, 524 U. S., at 807\u2013808; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764\u2013\n765. The term \u201ctangible employment action,\u201d Ellerth\nobserved, \u201cconstitutes a significant change in employment\nstatus, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassign-\nment with significantly different responsibilities, or a\ndecision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d Id., at\n761. Such an action, the Court explained, provides \u201cas-\nsurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the\nagency relation.\u201d Id., at 761\u2013762.\n   An employer may also be held vicariously liable for a\nsupervisor\u2019s harassment that does not culminate in a\ntangible employment action, the Court next determined.\n4               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nIn such a case, however, the employer may avoid liability\nby showing that (1) it exercised reasonable care to pre-\nvent and promptly correct harassing behavior, and (2)\nthe complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of\npreventative or corrective measures made available to her.\nFaragher, 524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765. The\nemployer bears the burden of establishing this affirmative\ndefense by a preponderance of the evidence. Faragher,\n524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765.\n  In contrast, if the harassing employee is a co-worker, a\nnegligence standard applies. To satisfy that standard, the\ncomplainant must show that the employer knew or should\nhave known of the offensive conduct but failed to take\nappropriate corrective action. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n799; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758\u2013759. See also 29 CFR\n\u00a71604.11(d) (2012); EEOC Guidance 405:7652.\n                              B\n   The distinction Faragher and Ellerth drew between\nsupervisors and co-workers corresponds to the realities of\nthe workplace. Exposed to a fellow employee\u2019s harass-\nment, one can walk away or tell the offender to \u201cbuzz off.\u201d\nA supervisor\u2019s slings and arrows, however, are not so\neasily avoided. An employee who confronts her harassing\nsupervisor risks, for example, receiving an undesirable or\nunsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She\nmay be saddled with an excessive workload or with place-\nment on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family\nlife. And she may be demoted or fired. Facing such\ndangers, she may be reluctant to blow the whistle on her\nsuperior, whose \u201cpower and authority invests his or her\nharassing conduct with a particular threatening charac-\nter.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763. See also Faragher, 524\nU. S., at 803; Brief for Respondent 23 (\u201cThe potential\nthreat to one\u2019s livelihood or working conditions will make\nthe victim think twice before resisting harassment or\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

In short, as Faragher and Ellerth recog-\nnized, harassment by supervisors is more likely to cause\npalpable harm and to persist unabated than similar con-\nduct by fellow employees.\n                               II\n   While Faragher and Ellerth differentiated harassment\nby supervisors from harassment by co-workers, neither\ndecision gave a definitive answer to the question: Who\nqualifies as a supervisor? Two views have emerged. One\nview, in line with the EEOC\u2019s Guidance, counts as a\nsupervisor anyone with authority to take tangible employ-\nment actions or to direct an employee\u2019s daily work activi-\nties. E.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 127\n(CA2 2003); Whitten v. Fred\u2019s, Inc., 601 F. 3d 231, 246\n(CA4 2010); EEOC Guidance 405:7654. The other view\nranks as supervisors only those authorized to take tangi-\nble employment actions. E.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398\nF. 3d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); Parkins v. Civil Constructors of\nIll., Inc., 163 F. 3d 1027, 1034 (CA7 1998); Joens v. John\nMorrell & Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940\u2013941 (CA8 2004).\n   Notably, respondent Ball State University agreed with\npetitioner Vance and the United States, as amicus curiae,\nthat the tangible-employment-action-only test \u201cdoes not\nnecessarily capture all employees who may qualify as\nsupervisors.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1. \u201c[V]icarious liabil-\nity,\u201d Ball State acknowledged, \u201calso may be triggered\nwhen the harassing employee has the authority to control\nthe victim\u2019s daily work activities in a way that materially\nenables the harassment.\u201d Id., at 1\u20132.\n   The different view taken by the Court today is out of\naccord with the agency principles that, Faragher and\nEllerth affirmed, govern Title VII. See supra, at 3\u20134. It is\nblind to the realities of the workplace, and it discounts the\nguidance of the EEOC, the agency Congress established to\ninterpret, and superintend the enforcement of, Title VII.\n6               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nUnder that guidance, the appropriate question is: Has\nthe employer given the alleged harasser authority to take\ntangible employment actions or to control the conditions\nunder which subordinates do their daily work? If the\nanswer to either inquiry is yes, vicarious liability is in\norder, for the superior-subordinate working arrangement\nfacilitating the harassment is of the employer\u2019s making.\n                              A\n   Until today, our decisions have assumed that employees\nwho direct subordinates\u2019 daily work are supervisors. In\nFaragher, the city of Boca Raton, Florida, employed Bill\nTerry and David Silverman to oversee the city\u2019s corps of\nocean lifeguards. 524 U. S., at 780. Terry and Silverman\n\u201crepeatedly subject[ed] Faragher and other female life-\nguards to uninvited and offensive touching,\u201d and they\nregularly \u201cma[de] lewd remarks, and [spoke] of women in\noffensive terms.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTerry told a job applicant that \u201cfemale lifeguards had sex\nwith their male counterparts,\u201d and then \u201casked whether\nshe would do the same.\u201d Id., at 782. Silverman threat-\nened to assign Faragher to toilet-cleaning duties for a year\nif she refused to date him. Id., at 780. In words and\nconduct, Silverman and Terry made the beach a hostile\nplace for women to work.\n   As Chief of Boca Raton\u2019s Marine Safety Division, Terry\nhad authority to \u201chire new lifeguards (subject to the ap-\nproval of higher management), to supervise all aspects of\nthe lifeguards\u2019 work assignments, to engage in counseling,\nto deliver oral reprimands, and to make a record of any\nsuch discipline.\u201d Id., at 781. Silverman\u2019s duties as a\nMarine Safety lieutenant included \u201cmaking the lifeguards\u2019\ndaily assignments, and . . . supervising their work and\nfitness training.\u201d Ibid. Both men \u201cwere granted virtually\nunchecked authority over their subordinates, directly\ncontrolling and supervising all aspects of Faragher\u2019s day-\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

See ante, at 9.1\nBut nothing in the Faragher record shows that Silver-\nman would. Silverman had oversight and assignment\nresponsibilities\u2014he could punish lifeguards who would not\ndate him with full-time toilet-cleaning duty\u2014but there\nwas no evidence that he had authority to take tangible\nemployment actions. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 780\u2013781.\nHolding that Boca Raton was vicariously liable for Silver-\nman\u2019s harassment, id., at 808\u2013809, the Court characterized\nhim as Faragher\u2019s supervisor, see id., at 780, and there\nwas no dissent on that point, see id., at 810 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting).\n   Subsequent decisions reinforced Faragher\u2019s use of the\nterm \u201csupervisor\u201d to encompass employees with authority\nto direct the daily work of their victims. In Pennsylvania\nState Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 140 (2004), for ex-\nample, the Court considered whether a constructive dis-\ncharge occasioned by supervisor harassment ranks as a\ntangible employment action. The harassing employees\nlacked authority to discharge or demote the complainant,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 It is not altogether evident that Terry would qualify under the\n\nCourt\u2019s test. His authority to hire was subject to approval by higher\nmanagement, Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 781 (1998), and\nthere is scant indication that he possessed other powers on the Court\u2019s\nlist. The Court observes that Terry was able to \u201crecommen[d],\u201d and\n\u201cinitiat[e]\u201d tangible employment actions. Ante, at 15, n. 8 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Nothing in the Faragher record, however,\nshows that Terry had authority to take such actions himself. Far-\nagher\u2019s complaint alleged that Terry said he would never promote a\nfemale lifeguard to the rank of lieutenant, 524 U.

Suders, 542 U.

Faragher illus-\ntrates an all-too-plain reality: A supervisor with authority\nto control subordinates\u2019 daily work is no less aided in his\nharassment than is a supervisor with authority to fire,\ndemote, or transfer. That Silverman could threaten Far-\nagher with toilet-cleaning duties while Terry could orally\nreprimand her was inconsequential in Faragher, and\nproperly so. What mattered was that both men took ad-\nvantage of the power vested in them as agents of Boca\nRaton to facilitate their abuse. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n801 (Silverman and Terry \u201cimplicitly threaten[ed] to mis-\nuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or\ncomplaint.\u201d). And when, assisted by an agency relation-\nship, in-charge superiors like Silverman perpetuate a\ndiscriminatory work environment, our decisions have\nappropriately held the employer vicariously liable, subject\nto the above-described affirmative defense.

James Connolly, the \u201cmechanic in\ncharge\u201d and the senior employee at the site, targeted Mack\nfor abuse. He commented frequently on her \u201cfantastic\nass,\u201d \u201cluscious lips,\u201d and \u201cbeautiful eyes,\u201d and, using de-\nplorable racial epithets, opined that minorities and women\ndid not \u201cbelong in the business.\u201d Once, he pulled her on\nhis lap, touched her buttocks, and tried to kiss her while\nothers looked on. Connolly lacked authority to take tangi-\nble employment actions against mechanic\u2019s helpers, but he\ndid assign their work, control their schedules, and direct\nthe particulars of their workdays. When he became angry\nwith Mack, for example, he denied her overtime hours.\nAnd when she complained about the mistreatment, he\nscoffed, \u201cI get away with everything.\u201d See Mack, 326\nF. 3d, at 120\u2013121, 125\u2013126 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  Donna Rhodes: Donna Rhodes, a seasonal highway\nmaintainer for the Illinois Department of Transportation,\nwas responsible for plowing snow during winter months.\nMichael Poladian was a \u201cLead Lead Worker\u201d and Matt\nMara, a \u201cTechnician\u201d at the maintenance yard where\nRhodes worked. Both men assembled plow crews and\nmanaged the work assignments of employees in Rhodes\u2019s\nposition, but neither had authority to hire, fire, promote,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The illustrative cases reached the appellate level after grants of\nsummary judgment in favor of the employer.

In her third\nseason working at the yard, Rhodes was verbally assaulted\nwith sex-based invectives and a pornographic image was\ntaped to her locker. Poladian forced her to wash her\ntruck in sub-zero temperatures, assigned her undesirable\nyard work instead of road crew work, and prohibited\nanother employee from fixing the malfunctioning heating\nsystem in her truck. Conceding that Rhodes had been\nsubjected to a sex-based hostile work environment, the\nDepartment of Transportation argued successfully in the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals that Poladian and\nMara were not Rhodes\u2019s supervisors because they lacked\nauthority to take tangible employment actions against\nher. See Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d 498,\n501\u2013503, 506\u2013507 (CA7 2004).\n   Clara Whitten: Clara Whitten worked at a discount\nretail store in Belton, South Carolina. On Whitten\u2019s first\nday of work, the manager, Matt Green, told her to \u201cgive\n[him] what [he] want[ed]\u201d in order to obtain approval for\nlong weekends off from work. Later, fearing what might\ntranspire, Whitten ignored Green\u2019s order to join him in an\nisolated storeroom. Angered, Green instructed Whitten to\nstay late and clean the store. He demanded that she work\nover the weekend despite her scheduled day off. Dismiss-\ning her as \u201cdumb and stupid,\u201d Green threatened to make\nher life a \u201cliving hell.\u201d Green lacked authority to fire,\npromote, demote, or otherwise make decisions affecting\nWhitten\u2019s pocketbook. But he directed her activities, gave\nher tasks to accomplish, burdened her with undesirable\nwork assignments, and controlled her schedule. He was\nusually the highest ranking employee in the store, and\nboth Whitten and Green considered him the supervisor.\nSee Whitten, 601 F. 3d, at 236, 244\u2013247 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Monika Starke: CRST Van Expedited, Inc., an interstate\ntransit company, ran a training program for newly hired\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Trainees like Starke\nwere paired in a truck cabin with a single \u201clead driver\u201d\nwho lacked authority to hire, fire, promote, or demote, but\nwho exercised control over the work environment for the\nduration of the trip. Lead drivers were responsible for\nproviding instruction on CRST\u2019s driving method, assigning\nspecific tasks, and scheduling rest stops. At the end of the\ntrip, lead drivers evaluated trainees\u2019 performance with a\nnonbinding pass or fail recommendation that could lead to\nfull driver status. Over the course of Starke\u2019s training\ntrip, her first lead driver, Bob Smith, filled the cabin with\nvulgar sexual remarks, commenting on her breast size and\ncomparing the gear stick to genitalia. A second lead driver,\nDavid Goodman, later forced her into unwanted sex with\nhim, an outrage to which she submitted, believing it\nnecessary to gain a passing grade. See EEOC v. CRST\nVan Expedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 665\u2013666, 684\u2013685\n(CA8 2012).\n   In each of these cases, a person vested with authority to\ncontrol the conditions of a subordinate\u2019s daily work life\nused his position to aid his harassment. But in none of\nthem would the Court\u2019s severely confined definition of su-\npervisor yield vicarious liability for the employer. The\nsenior elevator mechanic in charge, the Court today tells\nus, was Mack\u2019s co-worker, not her supervisor. So was the\nstore manager who punished Whitten with long hours for\nrefusing to give him what he wanted. So were the lead\ndrivers who controlled all aspects of Starke\u2019s working\nenvironment, and the yard worker who kept other employ-\nees from helping Rhodes to control the heat in her truck.\n   As anyone with work experience would immediately\ngrasp, James Connolly, Michael Poladian, Matt Mara,\nMatt Green, Bob Smith, and David Goodman wielded\nemployer-conferred supervisory authority over their vic-\ntims.

See ante, at 26\u201328,\nand nn. 15\u201316. Even under a vicarious liability rule, the Court points\nout, employers might escape liability for reasons other than the har-\nasser\u2019s status as supervisor. For example, Rhodes might have avoided\nsummary judgment in favor of her employer; even so, it would have\nbeen open to the employer to raise and prove to a jury the Faragher/\nEllerth affirmative defense, see supra, at 3\u20134. No doubt other bar-\nriers also might impede an employee from prevailing, for example,\nWhitten\u2019s and Starke\u2019s intervening bankruptcies, see Whitten v.

See Brief for\nSociety for Human Resource Management et al. 11\u201316. They are\nmistaken. The EEOC Guidance rests on the employer liability frame-\nwork set forth in Faragher and Ellerth, but both the framework and\nEEOC Guidance construe the term \u201cagent\u201d in 42 U. S.

Id., at 405:7655.\n   In my view, the EEOC\u2019s definition, which the Court puts\ndown as \u201ca study in ambiguity,\u201d ante, at 21, has the ring of\ntruth and, therefore, powerfully persuasive force. As a\nprecondition to vicarious employer liability, the EEOC\nexplained, the harassing supervisor must wield authority\nof sufficient magnitude to enable the harassment. In\nother words, the aided-in-accomplishment standard re-\nquires \u201csomething more than the employment relation\nitself.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 760. Furthermore, as the\nEEOC perceived, in assessing an employee\u2019s qualification\nas a supervisor, context is often key.

A supervisor, the Court holds, is\nsomeone empowered to \u201ctake tangible employment actions\nagainst the victim, i.e., to effect a \u2018significant change\nin employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to\npromote, reassignment with significantly different responsi-\nbilities, or a decision causing a significant change in bene-\nfits.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 9 (quoting Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 761).\nWhether reassignment authority makes someone a super-\nvisor might depend on whether the reassignment carries\neconomic consequences. Ante, at 16, n. 9. The power to\ndiscipline other employees, when the discipline has eco-\nnomic consequences, might count, too. Ibid. So might the\npower to initiate or make recommendations about tangible\nemployment actions. Ante, at 15, n. 8. And when an\nemployer \u201cconcentrates all decisionmaking authority in a\nfew individuals\u201d who rely on information from \u201cother\nworkers who actually interact with the affected employee,\u201d\nthe other workers may rank as supervisors (or maybe not;\nthe Court does not commit one way or the other). Ante,\nat 26.\n   Someone in search of a bright line might well ask, what\ncounts as \u201csignificantly different responsibilities\u201d? Can\nany economic consequence make a reassignment or\ndisciplinary action \u201csignificant,\u201d or is there a minimum\nthreshold? How concentrated must the decisionmaking\nauthority be to deem those not formally endowed with that\nauthority nevertheless \u201csupervisors\u201d?

BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe light it casts.5\n   That the Court has adopted a standard, rather than a\nclear rule, is not surprising, for no crisp definition of su-\npervisor could supply the unwavering line the Court de-\nsires. Supervisors, like the workplaces they manage, come\nin all shapes and sizes. Whether a pitching coach super-\nvises his pitchers (can he demote them?), or an artistic\ndirector supervises her opera star (can she impose signifi-\ncantly different responsibilities?), or a law firm associate\nsupervises the firm\u2019s paralegals (can she fire them?) are\nmatters not susceptible to mechanical rules and on-off\nswitches. One cannot know whether an employer has\nvested supervisory authority in an employee, and whether\nharassment is aided by that authority, without looking to\nthe particular working relationship between the harasser\nand the victim. That is why Faragher and Ellerth crafted\nan employer liability standard embracive of all whose\nauthority significantly aids in the creation and perpetua-\ntion of harassment.\n   The Court\u2019s focus on finding a definition of supervisor\ncapable of instant application is at odds with the Court\u2019s\nordinary emphasis on the importance of particular circum-\nstances in Title VII cases. See, e.g., Burlington Northern,\n548 U. S., at 69 (\u201c[T]he significance of any given act of\nretaliation will often depend upon the particular circum-\nstances.\u201d); Harris, 510 U.

See Doe v.\nOberweis Dairy, 456 F. 3d 704, 717 (2006) (\u201cThe difficulty of classifica-\ntion in this case arises from the fact that Nayman, the shift supervisor,\nwas in between the paradigmatic classes [of supervisor and co-worker].\nHe had supervisory responsibility in the sense of authority to direct the\nwork of the [ice-cream] scoopers, and he was even authorized to issue\ndisciplinary write-ups, but he had no authority to fire them.

S., at 81\u201382. The EEOC\u2019s\nGuidance so perceives.\n                              B\n   As a consequence of the Court\u2019s truncated conception of\nsupervisory authority, the Faragher and Ellerth frame-\nwork has shifted in a decidedly employer-friendly direc-\ntion. This realignment will leave many harassment\nvictims without an effective remedy and undermine Title\nVII\u2019s capacity to prevent workplace harassment.\n   The negligence standard allowed by the Court, see ante,\nat 24, scarcely affords the protection the Faragher and\nEllerth framework gave victims harassed by those in\ncontrol of their lives at work. Recall that an employer is\nnegligent with regard to harassment only if it knew or\nshould have known of the conduct but failed to take ap-\npropriate corrective action. See 29 CFR \u00a71604.11(d);\nEEOC Guidance 405:7652 to 405:7653. It is not uncom-\nmon for employers to lack actual or constructive notice of a\nharassing employee\u2019s conduct. See Lindemann & Gross-\nman 1378\u20131379. An employee may have a reputation as a\nharasser among those in his vicinity, but if no complaint\nmakes its way up to management, the employer will es-\ncape liability under a negligence standard. Id., at 1378.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court worries that the EEOC\u2019s definition of supervisor will\n\nconfound jurors who must first determine whether the harasser is a\nsupervisor and second apply the correct employer liability standard.\nAnte, at 22\u201324, and nn. 13, 14. But the Court can point to no evidence\nthat jury instructions on supervisor status in jurisdictions following the\nEEOC Guidance have in fact proved unworkable or confusing to jurors.\nMoreover, under the Court\u2019s definition of supervisor, jurors in many\ncases will be obliged to determine, as a threshold question, whether the\nalleged harasser possessed supervisory authority. See supra, at 15\u201316.\n18              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Faragher is illustrative. After enduring unrelenting\nharassment, Faragher reported Terry\u2019s and Silverman\u2019s\nconduct informally to Robert Gordon, another immediate\nsupervisor. 524 U. S., at 782\u2013783. But the lifeguards\nwere \u201ccompletely isolated from the City\u2019s higher manage-\nment,\u201d and it did not occur to Faragher to pursue the\nmatter with higher ranking city officials distant from the\nbeach. Id., at 783, 808 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nApplying a negligence standard, the Eleventh Circuit held\nthat, despite the pervasiveness of the harassment, and\ndespite Gordon\u2019s awareness of it, Boca Raton lacked con-\nstructive notice and therefore escaped liability. Id., at\n784\u2013785. Under the vicarious liability standard, however,\nBoca Raton could not make out the affirmative defense, for\nit had failed to disseminate a policy against sexual har-\nassment. Id., at 808\u2013809.\n   On top of the substantive differences in the negligence\nand vicarious liability standards, harassment victims,\nunder today\u2019s decision, are saddled with the burden of\nproving the employer\u2019s negligence whenever the harasser\nlacks the power to take tangible employment actions.\nFaragher and Ellerth, by contrast, placed the burden\nsquarely on the employer to make out the affirmative\ndefense. See Suders, 542 U. S., at 146 (citing Ellerth, 524\nU. S., at 765; Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807). This allocation\nof the burden was both sensible and deliberate: An em-\nployer has superior access to evidence bearing on whether\nit acted reasonably to prevent or correct harassing behav-\nior, and superior resources to marshal that evidence. See\n542 U. S., at 146, n. 7 (\u201cThe employer is in the best posi-\ntion to know what remedial procedures it offers to employ-\nees and how those procedures operate.\u201d).\n   Faced with a steeper substantive and procedural hill to\nclimb, victims like Yasharay Mack, Donna Rhodes, Clara\nWhitten, and Monika Starke likely will find it impossible\nto obtain redress.

Because supervisors are comparatively few, and\nemployees are many, \u201cthe employer has a greater oppor-\ntunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by\ncommon workers,\u201d and a greater incentive to \u201cscreen\n[supervisors], train them, and monitor their performance.\u201d\nFaragher, 524 U. S., at 803. Vicarious liability for em-\nployers serves this end. When employers know they will\nbe answerable for the injuries a harassing jobsite boss\ninflicts, their incentive to provide preventative instruction\nis heightened. If vicarious liability is confined to supervi-\nsors formally empowered to take tangible employment\nactions, however, employers will have a diminished incen-\ntive to train those who control their subordinates\u2019 work\nactivities and schedules, i.e., the supervisors who \u201cactually\ninteract\u201d with employees. Ante, at 26.\n                            IV\n  I turn now to the case before us. Maetta Vance worked\nas substitute server and part-time catering assistant for\nBall State University\u2019s Banquet and Catering Division.\nDuring the period in question, she alleged, Saundra Davis,\na catering specialist, and other Ball State employees\nsubjected her to a racially hostile work environment.\nApplying controlling Circuit precedent, the District Court\nand Seventh Circuit concluded that Davis was not Vance\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Nor is the Court\u2019s confinement of supervisor status needed to deter\n\ninsubstantial claims. Under the EEOC Guidance, a plaintiff must meet\nthe threshold requirement of actionable harassment and then show\nthat her supervisor\u2019s authority was of \u201csufficient magnitude\u201d to assist\nin the harassment. See EEOC Guidance 405:7652, 405:7654.\n20                  VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsupervisor, and reviewed Ball State\u2019s liability for her\nconduct under a negligence standard. 646 F. 3d 461, 470\u2013\n471 (2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\u201355a, 59a\u201360a. Because\nI would hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in restrict-\ning supervisor status to employees formally empowered\nto take tangible employment actions, I would remand\nfor application of the proper standard to Vance\u2019s claim.\nOn this record, however, there is cause to anticipate that\nDavis would not qualify as Vance\u2019s supervisor.8\n  Supervisor status is based on \u201cjob function rather than\njob title,\u201d and depends on \u201cspecific facts\u201d about the work-\ning relationship. EEOC Guidance 405:7654. See supra, at\n13. Vance has adduced scant evidence that Davis con-\ntrolled the conditions of her daily work. Vance stated in\nan affidavit that the general manager of the Catering\nDivision, Bill Kimes, was charged with \u201coverall supervi-\nsion in the kitchen,\u201d including \u201creassign[ing] people to\nperform different tasks,\u201d and \u201ccontrol[ling] the schedule.\u201d\nApp. 431. The chef, Shannon Fultz, assigned tasks by\npreparing \u201cprep lists\u201d of daily duties. Id., at 277\u2013279, 427.\nThere is no allegation that Davis had a hand in creating\nthese prep lists, nor is there any indication that, in fact,\nDavis otherwise controlled the particulars of Vance\u2019s\nworkday. Vance herself testified that she did not know\nwhether Davis was her supervisor. Id., at 198.\n  True, Davis\u2019 job description listed among her responsi-\nbilities \u201c[l]ead[ing] and direct[ing] kitchen part-time,\nsubstitute, and student employee helpers via demonstra-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In addition to concluding that Davis was not Vance\u2019s supervisor, the\nDistrict Court held that the conduct Vance alleged was \u201cneither suffi-\nciently severe nor pervasive to be considered objectively hostile for the\npurposes of Title VII.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. The Seventh Circuit\ndeclined to address this issue. See 646 F. 3d 461, 471 (2011). If the\ncase were remanded, the Court of Appeals could resolve the hostile\nenvironment issue first, and then, if necessary, Davis\u2019 status as super-\nvisor or co-worker.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

And\nanother employee testified to believing that Davis was \u201ca\nsupervisor.\u201d Id., at 386. But because the supervisor-\nstatus inquiry should focus on substance, not labels or\npaper descriptions, it is doubtful that this slim evidence\nwould enable Vance to survive a motion for summary\njudgment. Nevertheless, I would leave it to the Seventh\nCircuit to decide, under the proper standard for super-\nvisory status, what impact, if any, Davis\u2019 job description\nand the co-worker\u2019s statement should have on the deter-\nmination of Davis\u2019 status.9\n                              V\n  Regrettably, the Court has seized upon Vance\u2019s thin\ncase to narrow the definition of supervisor, and thereby\nmanifestly limit Title VII\u2019s protections against workplace\nharassment. Not even Ball State, the defendant-employer\nin this case, has advanced the restrictive definition the\nCourt adopts. See supra, at 5. Yet the Court, insistent on\nconstructing artificial categories where context should be\nkey, proceeds on an immoderate and unrestrained course\nto corral Title VII.\n  Congress has, in the recent past, intervened to correct\nthis Court\u2019s wayward interpretations of Title VII. See\nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 123 Stat. 5, super-\nseding Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S.\n618 (2007). See also Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat.\n1071, superseding in part, Lorance v. AT&T Technologies,\nInc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755\n(1989); Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The Court agrees that Davis \u201cwould probably not qualify\u201d as Vance\u2019s\n\nsupervisor under the EEOC\u2019s definition. Ante, at 28\u201329. Then why,\none might ask, does the Court nevertheless reach out to announce its\nrestrictive standard in this case, one in which all parties, including the\ndefendant-employer, accept the fitness for Title VII of the EEOC\u2019s\nGuidance? See supra, at 5.\n22              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(1989); and Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228\n(1989). The ball is once again in Congress\u2019 court to correct\nthe error into which this Court has fallen, and to restore\nthe robust protections against workplace harassment the\nCourt weakens today.\n                       *     *   *\n  For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of\nthe Seventh Circuit and remand the case for application of\nthe proper standard for determining who qualifies as a\nsupervisor.\n",

Argued November 26, 2012\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nUnder Title VII, an employer\u2019s liability for workplace harassment may\n depend on the status of the harasser. If the harassing employee is\n the victim\u2019s co-worker, the employer is liable only if it was negligent\n in controlling working conditions. In cases in which the harasser is a\n \u201csupervisor,\u201d however, different rules apply. If the supervisor\u2019s har-\n assment culminates in a tangible employment action (i.e., \u201ca signifi-\n cant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to\n promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or\n a decision causing a significant change in benefits,\u201d Burlington In-\n dustries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742, 761), the employer is strictly\n liable. But if no tangible employment action is taken, the employer\n may escape liability by establishing, as an affirmative defense, that\n (1) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any\n harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to\n take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities that the\n employer provided. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 807;\n Ellerth, supra, at 765.\n    Petitioner Vance, an African-American woman, sued her employer,\n Ball State University (BSU) alleging that a fellow employee, Saundra\n Davis, created a racially hostile work environment in violation of Ti-\n tle VII. The District Court granted summary judgment to BSU. It\n held that BSU was not vicariously liable for Davis\u2019 alleged actions be-\n cause Davis, who could not take tangible employment actions against\n Vance, was not a supervisor. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: An employee is a \u201csupervisor\u201d for purposes of vicarious liability\n under Title VII only if he or she is empowered by the employer to\n take tangible employment actions against the victim. Pp. 9\u201330.\n    (a) Petitioner errs in relying on the meaning of \u201csupervisor\u201d in gen-\n2                     VANCE v.

In any event, Con-\n    gress did not use the term \u201csupervisor\u201d in Title VII, and the way to\n    understand the term\u2019s meaning for present purposes is to consider\n    the interpretation that best fits within the highly structured frame-\n    work adopted in Faragher and Ellerth. Pp. 10\u201314.\n      (b) Petitioner misreads Faragher and Ellerth in claiming that those\n    cases support an expansive definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d because, in her\n    view, at least some of the alleged harassers in those cases, whom the\n    Court treated as supervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh\n    Circuit\u2019s definition demands. In Ellerth, there was no question that\n    the alleged harasser, who hired and promoted his victim, was a su-\n    pervisor. And in Faragher, the parties never disputed the characteri-\n    zation of the alleged harassers as supervisors, so the question simply\n    was not before the Court. Pp. 14\u201318.\n      (c) The answer to the question presented in this case is implicit in\n    the characteristics of the framework that the Court adopted in\n    Ellerth and Faragher, which draws a sharp line between co-workers\n    and supervisors and implies that the authority to take tangible em-\n    ployment actions is the defining characteristic of a supervisor.\n    Ellerth, supra, at 762.\n      The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor adopted today is\n    one that can be readily applied. An alleged harasser\u2019s supervisor sta-\n    tus will often be capable of being discerned before (or soon after) liti-\n    gation commences and is likely to be resolved as a matter of law be-\n    fore trial. By contrast, the vagueness of the EEOC\u2019s standard would\n    impede the resolution of the issue before trial, possibly requiring the\n    jury to be instructed on two very different paths of analysis, depend-\n    ing on whether it finds the alleged harasser to be a supervisor or\n    merely a co-worker.\n      This approach will not leave employees unprotected against har-\n    assment by co-workers who possess some authority to assign daily\n    tasks. In such cases, a victim can prevail simply by showing that the\n    employer was negligent in permitting the harassment to occur, and\n    the jury should be instructed that the nature and degree of authority\n    wielded by the harasser is an important factor in determining negli-\n    gence. Pp. 18\u201325.\n      (d) The definition adopted today accounts for the fact that many\n    modern organizations have abandoned a hierarchical management\n    structure in favor of giving employees overlapping authority with re-\n    spect to work assignments. Petitioner fears that employers will at-\n    tempt to insulate themselves from liability for workplace harassment\n    by empowering only a handful of individuals to take tangible em-\n    ployment actions, but a broad definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d is not neces-\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998), and Far-\nagher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998), namely, who\nqualifies as a \u201csupervisor\u201d in a case in which an employee\nasserts a Title VII claim for workplace harassment?\n  Under Title VII, an employer\u2019s liability for such har\u00ad\nassment may depend on the status of the harasser. If the\nharassing employee is the victim\u2019s co-worker, the employer\nis liable only if it was negligent in controlling working\nconditions. In cases in which the harasser is a \u201csuper-\nvisor,\u201d however, different rules apply. If the supervisor\u2019s\nharassment culminates in a tangible employment action,\nthe employer is strictly liable. But if no tangible employ\u00ad\nment action is taken, the employer may escape liability by\nestablishing, as an affirmative defense, that (1) the em\u00ad\nployer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct\nany harassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unrea\u00ad\nsonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or\ncorrective opportunities that the employer provided.

In 1991, BSU promoted Vance\nto a part-time catering assistant position, and in 2007 she\napplied and was selected for a position as a full-time cater\u00ad\ning assistant.\n   Over the course of her employment with BSU, Vance\nlodged numerous complaints of racial discrimination and\nretaliation, but most of those incidents are not at issue\nhere. For present purposes, the only relevant incidents\nconcern Vance\u2019s interactions with a fellow BSU employee,\nSaundra Davis.\n   During the time in question, Davis, a white woman, was\nemployed as a catering specialist in the Banquet and\nCatering division. The parties vigorously dispute the\nprecise nature and scope of Davis\u2019 duties, but they agree\nthat Davis did not have the power to hire, fire, demote,\npromote, transfer, or discipline Vance.

As a result, Vance filed\nthis lawsuit in 2006 in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Indiana, claiming, among other\nthings, that she had been subjected to a racially hostile\nwork environment in violation of Title VII.

The court concluded that Davis was not\nVance\u2019s supervisor and thus that Vance could not recover\nfrom BSU unless she could prove negligence.

This pro\u00ad\nvision obviously prohibits discrimination with respect to\nemployment decisions that have direct economic conse\u00ad\nquences, such as termination, demotion, and pay cuts.\nBut not long after Title VII was enacted, the lower courts\nheld that Title VII also reaches the creation or perpetua\u00ad\ntion of a discriminatory work environment.\n   In the leading case of Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234\n(1971), the Fifth Circuit recognized a cause of action based\non this theory. See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n477 U. S. 57, 65\u201366 (1986) (describing development of\nhostile environment claims based on race). The Rogers\ncourt reasoned that \u201cthe phrase \u2018terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment\u2019 in [Title VII] is an expansive\nconcept which sweeps within its protective ambit the\npractice of creating a working environment heavily\ncharged with ethnic or racial discrimination.\u201d 454 F. 2d,\nat 238. The court observed that \u201c[o]ne can readily envision\nworking environments so heavily polluted with discrimi\u00ad\nnation as to destroy completely the emotional and psy\u00ad\nchological stability of minority group workers.\u201d Ibid.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nFollowing this decision, the lower courts generally held that\nan employer was liable for a racially hostile work environ-\nment if the employer was negligent, i.e., if the employer\nknew or reasonably should have known about the harass\u00ad\nment but failed to take remedial action. See Ellerth, 524\nU. S., at 768\u2013769 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (citing cases).\n   When the issue eventually reached this Court, we\nagreed that Title VII prohibits the creation of a hostile\nwork environment. See Meritor, supra, at 64\u201367. In such\ncases, we have held, the plaintiff must show that the work\nenvironment was so pervaded by discrimination that the\nterms and conditions of employment were altered. See,\ne.g., Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21\n(1993).\n                                B\n   Consistent with Rogers, we have held that an employer\nis directly liable for an employee\u2019s unlawful harassment if\nthe employer was negligent with respect to the offensive\nbehavior. Faragher, 524 U. S., at 789. Courts have gen\u00ad\nerally applied this rule to evaluate employer liability when\na co-worker harasses the plaintiff.1\n   In Ellerth and Faragher, however, we held that different\nrules apply where the harassing employee is the plain-\ntiff \u2019s \u201csupervisor.\u201d In those instances, an employer may be\nvicariously liable for its employees\u2019 creation of a hostile\nwork environment. And in identifying the situations in\nwhich such vicarious liability is appropriate, we looked to\nthe Restatement of Agency for guidance. See, e.g., Meri-\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 See, e.g., Williams v. Waste Management of Ill., 361 F. 3d 1021, 1029\n\n(CA7 2004); McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F. 3d 1103, 1119 (CA9\n2004); Joens v. John Morrell & Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940 (CA8 2004);\nNoviello v. Boston, 398 F. 3d 76, 95 (CA1 2005); Duch v. Jakubek, 588\nF. 3d 757, 762 (CA2 2009); Huston v. Procter & Gamble Paper Prods.\nCorp., 568 F. 3d 100, 104\u2013105 (CA3 2009).\n6                   VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntor, supra, at 72; Ellerth, supra, at 755.\n   Under the Restatement, \u201cmasters\u201d are generally not\nliable for the torts of their \u201cservants\u201d when the torts are\ncommitted outside the scope of the servants\u2019 employment.\nSee 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7219(2), p. 481\n(1957) (Restatement). And because racial and sexual\nharassment are unlikely to fall within the scope of a serv\u00ad\nant\u2019s duties, application of this rule would generally pre\u00ad\nclude employer liability for employee harassment. See\nFaragher, supra, at 793\u2013796; Ellerth, supra, at 757. But\nin Ellerth and Faragher, we held that a provision of the\nRestatement provided the basis for an exception. Section\n219(2)(d) of that Restatement recognizes an exception to\nthe general rule just noted for situations in which the\nservant was \u201caided in accomplishing the tort by the exist\u00ad\nence of the agency relation.\u201d2 Restatement 481; see Far-\nagher, supra, at 802\u2013803; Ellerth, supra, at 760\u2013763.\n   Adapting this concept to the Title VII context, Ellerth\nand Faragher identified two situations in which the aided\u00ad\nin-the-accomplishment rule warrants employer liability\neven in the absence of negligence, and both of these situa\u00ad\ntions involve harassment by a \u201csupervisor\u201d as opposed to a\nco-worker. First, the Court held that an employer is vicar\u00ad\niously liable \u201cwhen a supervisor takes a tangible employ\u00ad\nment action,\u201d Ellerth, supra, at 762; Faragher, supra, at\n790\u2014i.e., \u201ca significant change in employment status, such\nas hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The Restatement (Third) of Agency disposed of this exception to\nliability, explaining that \u201c[t]he purposes likely intended to be met by\nthe \u2018aided in accomplishing\u2019 basis are satisfied by a more fully elaborat\u00ad\ned treatment of apparent authority and by the duty of reasonable care\nthat a principal owes to third parties with whom it interacts through\nemployees and other agents.\u201d 2 Restatement (Third) \u00a77.08, p. 228\n(2005). The parties do not argue that this change undermines our\nholdings in Faragher and Ellerth.\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsignificantly different responsibilities, or a decision caus\u00ad\ning a significant change in benefits.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at\n761. We explained the reason for this rule as follows:\n\u201cWhen a supervisor makes a tangible employment deci\u00ad\nsion, there is assurance the injury could not have been\ninflicted absent the agency relation. . . . A tangible em\u00ad\nployment decision requires an official act of the enterprise,\na company act. The decision in most cases is documented\nin official company records, and may be subject to review\nby higher level supervisors.\u201d Id., at 761\u2013762. In those\ncircumstances, we said, it is appropriate to hold the em\u00ad\nployer strictly liable. See Faragher, supra, at 807; Ellerth,\nsupra, at 765.\n   Second, Ellerth and Faragher held that, even when\na supervisor\u2019s harassment does not culminate in a tangible\nemployment action, the employer can be vicariously liable\nfor the supervisor\u2019s creation of a hostile work environment\nif the employer is unable to establish an affirmative de\u00ad\nfense.3 We began by noting that \u201ca supervisor\u2019s power\nand authority invests his or her harassing conduct with\na particular threatening character, and in this sense, a\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Faragher  and Ellerth involved hostile environment claims premised\non sexual harassment. Several federal courts of appeals have held that\nFaragher and Ellerth apply to other types of hostile environment\nclaims, including race-based claims. See Spriggs v. Diamond Auto\nGlass, 242 F. 3d 179, 186, n. 9 (CA4 2001) (citing cases reflecting \u201cthe\ndeveloping consensus . . . that the holdings [in Faragher and Ellerth]\napply with equal force to other types of harassment claims under Title\nVII\u201d). But see Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (stat\u00ad\ning that, as a result of the Court\u2019s decision in Ellerth, \u201cemployer liabil\u00ad\nity under Title VII is judged by different standards depending upon\nwhether a sexually or racially hostile work environment is alleged\u201d).\nNeither party in this case challenges the application of Faragher and\nEllerth to race-based hostile environment claims, and we assume that\nthe framework announced in Faragher and Ellerth applies to cases such\nas this one.\n8               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsupervisor always is aided by the agency relation.\u201d El-\nlerth, supra, at 763; see Faragher, 524 U. S., at 803\u2013805.\nBut it would go too far, we found, to make employers\nstrictly liable whenever a \u201csupervisor\u201d engages in harass\u00ad\nment that does not result in a tangible employment action,\nand we therefore held that in such cases the employer may\nraise an affirmative defense. Specifically, an employer can\nmitigate or avoid liability by showing (1) that it exercised\nreasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any har\u00ad\nassing behavior and (2) that the plaintiff unreasonably\nfailed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective\nopportunities that were provided. Faragher, supra, at 807;\nEllerth, 524 U. S., at 765. This compromise, we ex-\nplained, \u201caccommodate[s] the agency principles of vicari\u00ad\nous liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory\nauthority, as well as Title VII\u2019s equally basic policies of\nencouraging forethought by employers and saving action\nby objecting employees.\u201d Id., at 764.\n   The dissenting Members of the Court in Ellerth and\nFaragher would not have created a special rule for cases\ninvolving harassment by \u201csupervisors.\u201d Instead, they\nwould have held that an employer is liable for any em\u00ad\nployee\u2019s creation of a hostile work environment \u201cif, and\nonly if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negli\u00ad\ngent in permitting the [offending] conduct to occur.\u201d\nEllerth, supra, at 767 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); Faragher,\nsupra, at 810 (same).\n                             C\n  Under Ellerth and Faragher, it is obviously important\nwhether an alleged harasser is a \u201csupervisor\u201d or merely a\nco-worker, and the lower courts have disagreed about the\nmeaning of the concept of a supervisor in this context.\nSome courts, including the Seventh Circuit below, have\nheld that an employee is not a supervisor unless he or she\nhas the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Other\ncourts have substantially followed the more open-ended\napproach advocated by the EEOC\u2019s Enforcement Guid\u00ad\nance, which ties supervisor status to the ability to exercise\nsignificant direction over another\u2019s daily work. See, e.g.,\nMack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 126\u2013127 (CA2\n2003); Whitten v.

We reject\nthe nebulous definition of a \u201csupervisor\u201d advocated in the\nEEOC Guidance4 and substantially adopted by several\ncourts of appeals. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on colloquial uses\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The United States urges us to defer to the EEOC Guidance. Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 26\u201329 (citing Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944)). But to do so would be proper only if the\nEEOC Guidance has the power to persuade, which \u201cdepend[s] upon the\nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning,\n[and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.\u201d Id., at\n140. For the reasons explained below, we do not find the EEOC Guid\u00ad\nance persuasive.\n10              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof the term \u201csupervisor\u201d is misplaced, and her contention\nthat our cases require the EEOC\u2019s abstract definition is\nsimply wrong.\n   As we will explain, the framework set out in Ellerth and\nFaragher presupposes a clear distinction between supervi\u00ad\nsors and co-workers. Those decisions contemplate a uni\u00ad\ntary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the\nauthority to make tangible employment decisions. There\nis no hint in either decision that the Court had in mind\ntwo categories of supervisors: first, those who have such\nauthority and, second, those who, although lacking this\npower, nevertheless have the ability to direct a co-worker\u2019s\nlabor to some ill-defined degree. On the contrary, the\nEllerth/Faragher framework is one under which supervi\u00ad\nsory status can usually be readily determined, generally\nby written documentation. The approach recommended by\nthe EEOC Guidance, by contrast, would make the deter\u00ad\nmination of supervisor status depend on a highly case\u00ad\nspecific evaluation of numerous factors.\n  The Ellerth/Faragher framework represents what the\nCourt saw as a workable compromise between the aided\u00ad\nin-the-accomplishment theory of vicarious liability and the\nlegitimate interests of employers. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s\nunderstanding of the concept of a \u201csupervisor,\u201d with which\nwe agree, is easily workable; it can be applied without\nundue difficulty at both the summary judgment stage and\nat trial. The alternative, in many cases, would frustrate\njudges and confound jurors.\n                             A\n  Petitioner contends that her expansive understanding of\nthe concept of a \u201csupervisor\u201d is supported by the meaning\nof the word in general usage and in other legal contexts,\nsee Brief for Petitioner 25\u201328, but this argument is both\nincorrect on its own terms and, in any event, misguided.\n  In general usage, the term \u201csupervisor\u201d lacks a suffi\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nciently specific meaning to be helpful for present purposes.\nPetitioner is certainly right that the term is often used to\nrefer to a person who has the authority to direct another\u2019s\nwork. See, e.g., 17 Oxford English Dictionary 245 (2d ed.\n1989) (defining the term as applying to \u201cone who inspects\nand directs the work of others\u201d). But the term is also\noften closely tied to the authority to take what Ellerth\nand Faragher referred to as a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d\nSee, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary\n2296, def. 1(a) (1976) (\u201ca person having authority dele-\ngated by an employer to hire, transfer, suspend, recall,\npromote, assign, or discharge another employee or to rec-\nommend such action\u201d).\n   A comparison of the definitions provided by two collo\u00ad\nquial business authorities illustrates the term\u2019s impreci\u00ad\nsion in general usage. One says that \u201c[s]upervisors are\nusually authorized to recommend and/or effect hiring,\ndisciplining, promoting, punishing, rewarding, and other\nassociated activities regarding the employees in their\ndepartments.\u201d5 Another says exactly the opposite: \u201cA\nsupervisor generally does not have the power to hire or\nfire employees or to promote them.\u201d6 Compare Ellerth,\n524 U. S., at 762 (\u201cTangible employment actions fall with\u00ad\nin the special province of the supervisor\u201d).\n   If we look beyond general usage to the meaning of the\nterm in other legal contexts, we find much the same situa\u00ad\ntion. Sometimes the term is reserved for those in the\nupper echelons of the management hierarchy. See, e.g., 25\nU. S. C. \u00a72021(18) (defining the \u201csupervisor\u201d of a school\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/supervisor.html (all In-\n\nternet materials as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of\nCourt\u2019s case file).\n  6 http://management.about.com/od/policiesandprocedures/g/\n\nsupervisor1.html\n12                   VANCE v.

But sometimes the term is used to refer\nto lower ranking individuals.        See, e.g., 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7152(11) (defining a supervisor to include \u201cany individual\nhaving authority . . . to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off,\nrecall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline\nother employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust\ntheir grievances, or effectively to recommend such action,\nif in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such\nauthority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature,\nbut requires the use of independent judgment\u201d); 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71396n(j)(4)(A) (providing that an eligible Medicaid\nbeneficiary who receives care through an approved self\u00ad\ndirected services plan may \u201chire, fire, supervise, and man\u00ad\nage the individuals providing such services\u201d).\n   Although the meaning of the concept of a supervisor\nvaries from one legal context to another, the law often\ncontemplates that the ability to supervise includes the\nability to take tangible employment actions.7 See, e.g., 5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 One outlier that petitioner points to is the National Labor Relations\n\nAct (NLRA), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7152(11). Petitioner argues that the NLRA\u2019s\ndefinition supports her position in this case to the extent that it encom\u00ad\npasses employees who have the ability to direct or assign work to\nsubordinates. Brief for Petitioner 27\u201328.\n   The NLRA certainly appears to define \u201csupervisor\u201d in broad terms.\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the lower courts,\nhowever, have consistently explained that supervisory authority is not\ntrivial or insignificant: If the term \u201csupervisor\u201d is construed too broadly,\nthen employees who are deemed to be supervisors will be denied rights\nthat the NLRA was intended to protect. E.g., In re Connecticut Hu-\nmane Society, 358 NLRB No. 31, *33 (Apr. 12, 2012); Frenchtown\nAcquisition Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 683 F. 3d 298, 305 (CA6 2012); Beverly\nEnterprises-Massachusetts, Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F. 3d 960, 963 (CADC\n1999). Indeed, in defining a supervisor for purposes of the NLRA,\nCongress sought to distinguish \u201cbetween straw bosses, leadmen, set-up\nmen, and other minor supervisory employees, on the one hand, and the\nsupervisor vested with such genuine management prerogatives as the\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCFR \u00a7\u00a79701.511(a)(2), (3) (2012) (referring to a supervi\u00ad\nsor\u2019s authority to \u201chire, assign, and direct employees . . .\nand [t]o lay off and retain employees, or to suspend, re-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nright to hire or fire, discipline, or make effective recommendations with\nrespect to such action.\u201d S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1947).\nCf. NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U. S. 571,\n586 (1994) (HCRA) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (\u201cThrough case-by-case\nadjudication, the Board has sought to distinguish individuals exercising\nthe level of control that truly places them in the ranks of management,\nfrom highly skilled employees, whether professional or technical, who\nperform, incidentally to their skilled work, a limited supervisory role\u201d).\nAccordingly, the NLRB has interpreted the NLRA\u2019s statutory definition\nof supervisor more narrowly than its plain language might permit. See,\ne.g., Connecticut Humane Society, supra, at *39 (an employee who\nevaluates others is not a supervisor unless the evaluation \u201caffect[s] the\nwages and the job status of the employee evaluated\u201d); In re CGLM, Inc.,\n350 NLRB 974, 977 (2007) (\u201c \u2018If any authority over someone else, no\nmatter how insignificant or infrequent, made an employee a super-\nvisor, our industrial composite would be predominantly supervisory.\nEvery order-giver is not a supervisor. Even the traffic director tells the\npresident of the company where to park his car\u2019 \u201d (quoting NLRB v.\nSecurity Guard Serv., Inc., 384 F. 2d 143, 151 (CA5 1967))). The NLRA\ntherefore does not define the term \u201csupervisor\u201d as broadly as petitioner\nsuggests.\n   To be sure, the NLRA may in some instances define \u201csupervisor\u201d\nmore broadly than we define the term in this case. But those differ\u00ad\nences reflect the NLRA\u2019s unique purpose, which is to preserve the\nbalance of power between labor and management, see HCRA, supra, at\n573 (explaining that Congress amended the NLRA to exclude supervi\u00ad\nsors in order to address the \u201cimbalance between labor and manage\u00ad\nment\u201d that resulted when \u201csupervisory employees could organize as\npart of bargaining units and negotiate with the employer\u201d). That\npurpose is inapposite in the context of Title VII, which focuses on\neradicating discrimination. An employee may have a sufficient degree\nof authority over subordinates such that Congress has decided that the\nemployee should not participate with lower level employees in the same\ncollective-bargaining unit (because, for example, a higher level employ\u00ad\nee will pursue his own interests at the expense of lower level employees\u2019\ninterests), but that authority is not necessarily sufficient to merit\nheightened liability for the purposes of Title VII. The NLRA\u2019s defini\u00ad\ntion of supervisor therefore is not controlling in this context.\n14              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmove, reduce in grade, band, or pay, or take other discipli\u00ad\nnary action against such employees or, with respect to\nfilling positions, to make selections for appointments from\nproperly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or\nfrom any other appropriate source\u201d); \u00a79701.212(b)(4) (de\u00ad\nfining \u201csupervisory work\u201d as that which \u201cmay involve\nhiring or selecting employees, assigning work, managing\nperformance, recognizing and rewarding employees, and\nother associated duties\u201d).\n   In sum, the term \u201csupervisor\u201d has varying meanings\nboth in colloquial usage and in the law. And for this\nreason, petitioner\u2019s argument, taken on its own terms, is\nunsuccessful.\n   More important, petitioner is misguided in suggesting\nthat we should approach the question presented here as if\n\u201csupervisor\u201d were a statutory term. \u201cSupervisor\u201d is not a\nterm used by Congress in Title VII. Rather, the term was\nadopted by this Court in Ellerth and Faragher as a label\nfor the class of employees whose misconduct may give\nrise to vicarious employer liability. Accordingly, the way\nto understand the meaning of the term \u201csupervisor\u201d for\npresent purposes is to consider the interpretation that\nbest fits within the highly structured framework that\nthose cases adopted.\n                             B\n  In considering Ellerth and Faragher, we are met at the\noutset with petitioner\u2019s contention that at least some of\nthe alleged harassers in those cases, whom we treated as\nsupervisors, lacked the authority that the Seventh Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s definition demands. This argument misreads our\ndecisions.\n  In Ellerth, it was clear that the alleged harasser was a\nsupervisor under any definition of the term: He hired his\nvictim, and he promoted her (subject only to the minis-\nterial approval of his supervisor, who merely signed the\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Ellerth was a case from\nthe Seventh Circuit, and at the time of its decision in that\ncase, that court had already adopted its current definition\nof a supervisor. See Volk v. Coler, 845 F. 2d 1422, 1436\n(1988). See also Parkins v. Civil Constructors of Ill., Inc.,\n163 F. 3d 1027, 1033, n. 1 (CA7 1998) (discussing Circuit\ncase law). Although the en banc Seventh Circuit in\nEllerth issued eight separate opinions, there was no disa\u00ad\ngreement about the harasser\u2019s status as a supervisor.\nJansen v. Packaging Corp. of America, 123 F. 3d 490\n(1997) (per curiam). Likewise, when the case reached this\nCourt, no question about the harasser\u2019s status was raised.\n   The same is true with respect to Faragher. In that case,\nFaragher, a female lifeguard, sued her employer, the city\nof Boca Raton, for sexual harassment based on the conduct\nof two other lifeguards, Bill Terry and David Silverman,\nand we held that the city was vicariously liable for Terry\u2019s\nand Silverman\u2019s harassment. Although it is clear that\nTerry had authority to take tangible employment actions\naffecting the victim,8 see 524 U. S., at 781 (explaining that\nTerry could hire new lifeguards, supervise their work\nassignments, counsel, and discipline them), Silverman\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The dissent suggests that it is unclear whether Terry would qualify\n\nas a supervisor under the test we adopt because his hiring decisions\nwere subject to approval by higher management. Post, at 7, n. 1 (opin\u00ad\nion of GINSBURG, J.). See also Faragher, 524 U. S., at 781. But we have\nassumed that tangible employment actions can be subject to such\napproval. See Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. In any event, the record\nindicates that Terry possessed the power to make employment deci\u00ad\nsions having direct economic consequences for his victims. See Brief for\nPetitioner in Faragher v. Boca Raton, O. T. 1997, No. 97\u2013282, p. 9 (\u201cNo\none, during the twenty years that Terry was Marine Safety Chief, was\nhired without his recommendation.

Nevertheless, the city never disputed Far\u00ad\nagher\u2019s characterization of both men as her \u201csupervisors.\u201d\nSee App., O.

See Brief for Petitioner, O. T.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Moreover,   it is by no means certain that Silverman lacked the au\u00ad\nthority to take tangible employment actions against Faragher. In her\nmerits brief, Faragher stated that, as a lieutenant, Silverman \u201cmade\nsupervisory and disciplinary decisions and had input on the evaluations\nas well.\u201d Id., at 9\u201310. If that discipline had economic consequences\n(such as suspension without pay), then Silverman might qualify as a\nsupervisor under the definition we adopt today.\n   Silverman\u2019s ability to assign Faragher significantly different work\nresponsibilities also may have constituted a tangible employment\naction. Silverman told Faragher, \u201c \u2018Date me or clean the toilets for a\nyear.\u2019 \u201d Faragher, supra, at 780. That threatened reassignment of\nduties likely would have constituted significantly different responsibili\u00ad\nties for a lifeguard, whose job typically is to guard the beach. If that\nreassignment had economic consequences, such as foreclosing Far-\nagher\u2019s eligibility for promotion, then it might constitute a tangible\nemployment action.\n   10 The lower court did not even address this issue. See Faragher v.\n\nBoca Raton, 111 F. 3d 1530, 1547 (CA11 1997) (Anderson, J., concur\u00ad\nring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that it was unnecessary to\n\u201cdecide the threshold level of authority which a supervisor must possess\nin order to impose liability on the employer\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

As the dissent implicitly acknowledges, the supervi\u00ad\nsor status of the harassing employees was not before us in that case.\nSee post, at 8. Indeed, the employer conceded early in the litigation\nthat the relevant employees were supervisors, App. in Pennsylvania\nState Police v. Suders, O. T. 2003, No. 03\u201395, p. 20 (Answer \u00b629),\nand we therefore had no occasion to question that unchallenged\ncharacterization.\n18              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsimply not sufficient. Employees with such powers are\ncertainly capable of creating intolerable work environ\u00ad\nments, see post, at 9\u201311 (discussing examples), but so are\nmany other co-workers. Negligence provides the better\nframework for evaluating an employer\u2019s liability when a\nharassing employee lacks the power to take tangible em\u00ad\nployment actions.\n                               C\n   Although our holdings in Faragher and Ellerth do not\nresolve the question now before us, we believe that the\nanswer to that question is implicit in the characteristics of\nthe framework that we adopted.\n   To begin, there is no hint in either Ellerth or Faragher\nthat the Court contemplated anything other than a uni\u00ad\ntary category of supervisors, namely, those possessing the\nauthority to effect a tangible change in a victim\u2019s terms or\nconditions of employment. The Ellerth/Faragher framework\ndraws a sharp line between co-workers and supervisors.\nCo-workers, the Court noted, \u201ccan inflict psychologi-\ncal injuries\u201d by creating a hostile work environment, but\nthey \u201ccannot dock another\u2019s pay, nor can one co-worker\ndemote another.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 762. Only a su\u00ad\npervisor has the power to cause \u201cdirect economic harm\u201d by\ntaking a tangible employment action. Ibid. \u201cTangible\nemployment actions fall within the special province of the\nsupervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the\ncompany as a distinct class of agent to make economic\ndecisions affecting other employees under his or her con\u00ad\ntrol. . . . Tangible employment actions are the means by\nwhich the supervisor brings the official power of the en\u00ad\nterprise to bear on subordinates.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThe strong implication of this passage is that the authori\u00ad\nty to take tangible employment actions is the defining\ncharacteristic of a supervisor, not simply a characteristic\nof a subset of an ill-defined class of employees who qualify\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nas supervisors.\n   The way in which we framed the question presented\nin Ellerth supports this understanding. As noted, the\nEllerth/Faragher framework sets out two circumstances\nin which an employer may be vicariously liable for a su\u00ad\npervisor\u2019s harassment. The first situation (which results\nin strict liability) exists when a supervisor actually takes\na tangible employment action based on, for example, a\nsubordinate\u2019s refusal to accede to sexual demands. The\nsecond situation (which results in vicarious liability if the\nemployer cannot make out the requisite affirmative de\u00ad\nfense) is present when no such tangible action is taken.\nBoth Ellerth and Faragher fell into the second category,\nand in Ellerth, the Court couched the question at issue in\nthe following terms: \u201cwhether an employer has vicarious\nliability when a supervisor creates a hostile work en-\nvironment by making explicit threats to alter a subor\u00ad\ndinate\u2019s terms or conditions of employment, based on sex,\nbut does not fulfill the threat.\u201d 524 U. S., at 754. This\nstatement plainly ties the second situation to a supervi\u00ad\nsor\u2019s authority to inflict direct economic injury. It is be\u00ad\ncause a supervisor has that authority\u2014and its potential\nuse hangs as a threat over the victim\u2014that vicarious\nliability (subject to the affirmative defense) is justified.\n   Finally, the Ellerth/Faragher Court sought a frame\u00ad\nwork that would be workable and would appropriately\ntake into account the legitimate interests of employers and\nemployees. The Court looked to principles of agency law\nfor guidance, but the Court concluded that the \u201cmalleable\nterminology\u201d of the aided-in-the-commission principle\ncounseled against the wholesale incorporation of that\nprinciple into Title VII case law. Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763.\nInstead, the Court also considered the objectives of Title\nVII, including \u201cthe limitation of employer liability in cer\u00ad\ntain circumstances.\u201d Id., at 764.\n   The interpretation of the concept of a supervisor that we\n20                 VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nadopt today is one that can be readily applied. In a great\nmany cases, it will be known even before litigation is\ncommenced whether an alleged harasser was a supervi\u00ad\nsor, and in others, the alleged harasser\u2019s status will be\u00ad\ncome clear to both sides after discovery. And once this is\nknown, the parties will be in a position to assess the\nstrength of a case and to explore the possibility of resolv\u00ad\ning the dispute. Where this does not occur, supervisor\nstatus will generally be capable of resolution at summary\njudgment. By contrast, under the approach advocated by\npetitioner and the EEOC, supervisor status would very\noften be murky\u2014as this case well illustrates.12\n   According to petitioner, the record shows that Davis, her\nalleged harasser, wielded enough authority to qualify as a\nsupervisor. Petitioner points in particular to Davis\u2019 job\ndescription, which gave her leadership responsibilities,\nand to evidence that Davis at times led or directed Vance\nand other employees in the kitchen. See Brief for Peti\u00ad\ntioner 42\u201343 (citing record); Reply Brief 22\u201323 (same).\nThe United States, on the other hand, while applying the\nsame open-ended test for supervisory status, reaches the\nopposite conclusion. At least on the present record, the\nUnited States tells us, Davis fails to qualify as a supervi\u00ad\nsor. Her job description, in the Government\u2019s view, is not\ndispositive, and the Government adds that it would not be\nenough for petitioner to show that Davis \u201coccasionally took\nthe lead in the kitchen.\u201d Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31 (U.

Em\u00ad\nployment discrimination cases present an almost unlimited number\nof factual variations, and marginal cases are inevitable under any\nstandard.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nEEOC\u2019s definition of a supervisor, which both petitioner\nand the United States defend, is a study in ambiguity. In\nits Enforcement Guidance, the EEOC takes the position\nthat an employee, in order to be classified as a supervisor,\nmust wield authority \u201c \u2018of sufficient magnitude so as to as\u00ad\nsist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out\nthe harassment.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 27 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert.\n89a (EEOC Guidance)). But any authority over the work\nof another employee provides at least some assistance, see\nEllerth, supra, at 763, and that is not what the United\nStates interprets the Guidance to mean. Rather, it in\u00ad\nforms us, the authority must exceed both an ill-defined\ntemporal requirement (it must be more than \u201cocca\u00ad\nsiona[l]\u201d) and an ill-defined substantive requirement (\u201can\nemployee who directs \u2018only a limited number of tasks or\nassignments\u2019 for another employee . . . would not have\nsufficient authority to qualify as a supervisor.\u201d U. S. Brief\n28 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance));\nU. S. Brief 31.\n   We read the EEOC Guidance as saying that the number\n(and perhaps the importance) of the tasks in question is a\nfactor to be considered in determining whether an employ\u00ad\nee qualifies as a supervisor. And if this is a correct inter\u00ad\npretation of the EEOC\u2019s position, what we are left with is\na proposed standard of remarkable ambiguity.\n   The vagueness of this standard was highlighted at oral\nargument when the attorney representing the United\nStates was asked to apply that standard to the situation in\nFaragher, where the alleged harasser supposedly threat\u00ad\nened to assign the plaintiff to clean the toilets in the life\u00ad\nguard station for a year if she did not date him. 524 U. S.,\nat 780. Since cleaning the toilets is just one task, albeit an\nunpleasant one, the authority to assign that job would not\nseem to meet the more-than-a-limited-number-of-tasks\nrequirement in the EEOC Guidance. Nevertheless, the\nGovernment attorney\u2019s first response was that the author\u00ad\n22              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nity to make this assignment would be enough. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 23. He later qualified that answer by saying that it\nwould be necessary to \u201cknow how much of the day\u2019s work\n[was] encompassed by cleaning the toilets.\u201d Id., at 23\u201324.\nHe did not explain what percentage of the day\u2019s work\n(50%, 25%, 10%?) would suffice.\n   The Government attorney\u2019s inability to provide a de-\nfinitive answer to this question was the inevitable con-\nsequence of the vague standard that the Government\nasks us to adopt. Key components of that standard\u2014\n\u201csufficient\u201d authority, authority to assign more than a\n\u201climited number of tasks,\u201d and authority that is exercised\nmore than \u201coccasionally\u201d\u2014have no clear meaning. Apply\u00ad\ning these standards would present daunting problems for\nthe lower federal courts and for juries.\n   Under the definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d that we adopt to\u00ad\nday, the question of supervisor status, when contested, can\nvery often be resolved as a matter of law before trial. The\nelimination of this issue from the trial will focus the ef\u00ad\nforts of the parties, who will be able to present their cases\nin a way that conforms to the framework that the jury will\napply. The plaintiff will know whether he or she must\nprove that the employer was negligent or whether the\nemployer will have the burden of proving the elements of\nthe Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. Perhaps even\nmore important, the work of the jury, which is inevitably\ncomplicated in employment discrimination cases, will be\nsimplified. The jurors can be given preliminary instruc\u00ad\ntions that allow them to understand, as the evidence\ncomes in, how each item of proof fits into the framework\nthat they will ultimately be required to apply. And even\nwhere the issue of supervisor status cannot be eliminated\nfrom the trial (because there are genuine factual disputes\nabout an alleged harasser\u2019s authority to take tangible\nemployment actions), this preliminary question is rela-\ntively straightforward.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

The complexity of the standard they\nfavor would impede the resolution of the issue before trial.\nWith the issue still open when trial commences, the par\u00ad\nties would be compelled to present evidence and argu\u00ad\nment on supervisor status, the affirmative defense, and the\nquestion of negligence, and the jury would have to grapple\nwith all those issues as well. In addition, it would often be\nnecessary for the jury to be instructed about two very\ndifferent paths of analysis, i.e., what to do if the alleged\nharasser was found to be a supervisor and what to do if\nthe alleged harasser was found to be merely a co-worker.\n   Courts and commentators alike have opined on the need\nfor reasonably clear jury instructions in employment\ndiscrimination cases.13 And the danger of juror confusion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 See, e.g., Gross v.

The nature and degree of authority possessed by\nharassing employees varies greatly, see post, 9\u201311 (offer\u00ad\ning examples), and as we explained above, the test pro\u00ad\nposed by petitioner and the United States is ill equipped to\ndeal with the variety of situations that will inevitably\narise. This variety presents no problem for the negligence\nstandard, which is thought to provide adequate protection\nfor tort plaintiffs in many other situations. There is no\nreason why this standard, if accompanied by proper in\u00ad\nstructions, cannot provide the same service in the context\nat issue here.\n                              D\n   The dissent argues that the definition of a supervisor\nthat we now adopt is out of touch with the realities of\nthe workplace, where individuals with the power to assign\ndaily tasks are often regarded by other employees as\nsupervisors. See post, at 5, 8\u201312. But in reality it is the\nalternative that is out of touch. Particularly in modern\norganizations that have abandoned a highly hierarchical\nmanagement structure, it is common for employees to\nhave overlapping authority with respect to the assignment\nof work tasks. Members of a team may each have the\nresponsibility for taking the lead with respect to a particu\u00ad\nlar aspect of the work and thus may have the responsibil\u00ad\nity to direct each other in that area of responsibility.\n   Finally, petitioner argues that tying supervisor status to\nthe authority to take tangible employment actions will\nencourage employers to attempt to insulate themselves\nfrom liability for workplace harassment by empowering\nonly a handful of individuals to take tangible employment\nactions. But a broad definition of \u201csupervisor\u201d is not nec\u00ad\nessary to guard against this concern.\n   As an initial matter, an employer will always be liable\nwhen its negligence leads to the creation or continuation of\n26              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\na hostile work environment. And even if an employer\nconcentrates all decisionmaking authority in a few indi\u00ad\nviduals, it likely will not isolate itself from heightened\nliability under Faragher and Ellerth. If an employer does\nattempt to confine decisionmaking power to a small num\u00ad\nber of individuals, those individuals will have a limited\nability to exercise independent discretion when making\ndecisions and will likely rely on other workers who actu-\nally interact with the affected employee. Cf. Rhodes v.\nIllinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d 498, 509 (CA7 2004)\n(Rovner, J., concurring in part and concurring in judg\u00ad\nment) (\u201cAlthough they did not have the power to take\nformal employment actions vis-\u00e0-vis [the victim], [the\nharassers] necessarily must have had substantial input\ninto those decisions, as they would have been the people\nmost familiar with her work\u2014certainly more familiar with\nit than the off-site Department Administrative Services\nManager\u201d). Under those circumstances, the employer may\nbe held to have effectively delegated the power to take\ntangible employment actions to the employees on whose\nrecommendations it relies.

However,\nthe dissent does not mention why the plaintiffs would lose\nin those cases. It is not clear in any of those examples\nthat the legal outcome hinges on the definition of \u201csuper\u00ad\nvisor.\u201d For example, Clara Whitten ultimately did not\nprevail on her discrimination claims\u2014notwithstanding the\nfact that the Fourth Circuit adopted the approach advo\u00ad\ncated by the dissent, see Whitten v.

But before it had an opportunity to\nmake any such determination, Mack withdrew her complaint and the\nDistrict Court dismissed her claims with prejudice.

No. 380, Exh. 1, \u00b61, notwithstanding\nthe fact that the court in that case applied the definition of\n\u201csupervisor\u201d that we adopt today, see EEOC v. CRST Van\nExpedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 684 (CA8 2012).\n   In any event, the dissent is wrong in claiming that our\nholding would preclude employer liability in other cases\nwith facts similar to these. Assuming that a harasser is\nnot a supervisor, a plaintiff could still prevail by showing\nthat his or her employer was negligent in failing to pre\u00ad\nvent harassment from taking place. Evidence that an\nemployer did not monitor the workplace, failed to respond\nto complaints, failed to provide a system for registering\ncomplaints, or effectively discouraged complaints from\nbeing filed would be relevant. Thus, it is not true, as the\ndissent asserts, that our holding \u201crelieves scores of em\u00ad\nployers of responsibility\u201d for the behavior of workers they\nemploy. Post, at 14.\n   The standard we adopt is not untested. It has been the\nlaw for quite some time in the First, Seventh, and Eighth\nCircuits, see, e.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398 F. 3d 76, 96 (CA1\n2005); Weyers v. Lear Operations Corp., 359 F. 3d 1049,\n1057 (CA8 2004); Parkins v.

We\nare aware of no evidence that this rule has produced dire\nconsequences in these 14 jurisdictions.\n   Despite its rhetoric, the dissent acknowledges that\nDavis, the alleged harasser in this case, would probably\nnot qualify as a supervisor even under the dissent\u2019s pre\u00ad\nferred approach. See post, at 20 (\u201c[T]here is cause to\nanticipate that Davis would not qualify as Vance\u2019s super\u00ad\nvisor\u201d). On that point, we agree.

The record\nindicates that Bill Kimes (the general manager of the\nCatering Division) and the chef assigned petitioner\u2019s\ndaily tasks, which were given to her on \u201cprep lists.\u201d No.\n1:06\u2013cv\u20131452\u2013SEB\u2013JMS, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4247836</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *7 (SD Ind.,\nSept. 10, 2008); App. 430, 431. The fact that Davis some\u00ad\ntimes may have handed prep lists to petitioner, see id., at\n74, is insufficient to confer supervisor status, see App. to\nPet. for Cert. 92a (EEOC Guidance). And Kimes\u2014not\nDavis\u2014set petitioner\u2019s work schedule. See App. 431. See\nalso id., at 212.\n   Because the dissent concedes that our approach in this\ncase deprives petitioner of none of the protections that Ti-\ntle VII offers, the dissent\u2019s critique is based on nothing\nmore than a hypothesis as to how our approach might\naffect the outcomes of other cases\u2014cases where an em\u00ad\nployee who cannot take tangible employment actions, but\nwho does direct the victim\u2019s daily work activities in a\nmeaningful way, creates an unlawful hostile environment,\nand yet does not wield authority of such a degree and\nnature that the employer can be deemed negligent with\nrespect to the harassment. We are skeptical that there\nare a great number of such cases. However, we are confi\u00ad\ndent that, in every case, the approach we take today will\nbe more easily administrable than the approach advocated\nby the dissent.\n30               VANCE v.

Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998), and\nBurlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742 (1998),\nthis Court held that an employer can be vicariously liable\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for harass-\nment by an employee given supervisory authority over\nsubordinates. In line with those decisions, in 1999, the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\nprovided enforcement guidance \u201cregarding employer liabil-\nity for harassment by supervisors based on sex, race, color,\nreligion, national origin, age, disability, or protected activ-\nity.\u201d EEOC, Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability\nFor Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, 8 BNA FEP\nManual 405:7651 (Feb. 2003) (hereinafter EEOC Guid-\nance). Addressing who qualifies as a supervisor, the\nEEOC answered: (1) an individual authorized \u201cto under-\ntake or recommend tangible employment decisions affect-\ning the employee,\u201d including \u201chiring, firing, promoting,\ndemoting, and reassigning the employee\u201d; or (2) an indi-\nvidual authorized \u201cto direct the employee\u2019s daily work\nactivities.\u201d Id., at 405:7654.\n   The Court today strikes from the supervisory category\nemployees who control the day-to-day schedules and as-\nsignments of others, confining the category to those for-\n2                VANCE v.

I would follow the EEOC\u2019s Guid-\nance and hold that the authority to direct an employee\u2019s\ndaily activities establishes supervisory status under Title\nVII.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Title VII makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for\nan employer\u201d to \u201cdiscriminate against any individual with\nrespect to\u201d the \u201cterms, conditions, or privileges of employ-\nment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin.\u201d 42 U.

Recognizing that Title VII\u2019s definition of \u201cem-\nployer\u201d includes an employer\u2019s \u201cagent[s],\u201d 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a72000e(b), the Court looked to agency law for guidance in\nformulating liability standards. Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n791, 801; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 755\u2013760. In particular, the\nCourt drew upon \u00a7219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of\nAgency (1957), which makes an employer liable for the\nconduct of an employee, even when that employee acts\nbeyond the scope of her employment, if the employee is\n\u201caided in accomplishing\u201d a tort \u201cby the existence of the\nagency relation.\u201d See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 801; Ellerth,\n524 U. S., at 758.\n   Stemming from that guide, Faragher and Ellerth distin-\nguished between harassment perpetrated by supervisors,\nwhich is often enabled by the supervisor\u2019s agency relation-\nship with the employer, and harassment perpetrated by\nco-workers, which is not similarly facilitated. Faragher,\n524 U. S., at 801\u2013803; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763\u2013765. If\nthe harassing employee is a supervisor, the Court held,\nthe employer is vicariously liable whenever the harass-\nment culminates in a tangible employment action. Far-\nagher, 524 U. S., at 807\u2013808; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 764\u2013\n765. The term \u201ctangible employment action,\u201d Ellerth\nobserved, \u201cconstitutes a significant change in employment\nstatus, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassign-\nment with significantly different responsibilities, or a\ndecision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d Id., at\n761. Such an action, the Court explained, provides \u201cas-\nsurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the\nagency relation.\u201d Id., at 761\u2013762.\n   An employer may also be held vicariously liable for a\nsupervisor\u2019s harassment that does not culminate in a\ntangible employment action, the Court next determined.\n4               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nIn such a case, however, the employer may avoid liability\nby showing that (1) it exercised reasonable care to pre-\nvent and promptly correct harassing behavior, and (2)\nthe complainant unreasonably failed to take advantage of\npreventative or corrective measures made available to her.\nFaragher, 524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765. The\nemployer bears the burden of establishing this affirmative\ndefense by a preponderance of the evidence. Faragher,\n524 U. S., at 807; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 765.\n  In contrast, if the harassing employee is a co-worker, a\nnegligence standard applies. To satisfy that standard, the\ncomplainant must show that the employer knew or should\nhave known of the offensive conduct but failed to take\nappropriate corrective action. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n799; Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 758\u2013759. See also 29 CFR\n\u00a71604.11(d) (2012); EEOC Guidance 405:7652.\n                              B\n   The distinction Faragher and Ellerth drew between\nsupervisors and co-workers corresponds to the realities of\nthe workplace. Exposed to a fellow employee\u2019s harass-\nment, one can walk away or tell the offender to \u201cbuzz off.\u201d\nA supervisor\u2019s slings and arrows, however, are not so\neasily avoided. An employee who confronts her harassing\nsupervisor risks, for example, receiving an undesirable or\nunsafe work assignment or an unwanted transfer. She\nmay be saddled with an excessive workload or with place-\nment on a shift spanning hours disruptive of her family\nlife. And she may be demoted or fired. Facing such\ndangers, she may be reluctant to blow the whistle on her\nsuperior, whose \u201cpower and authority invests his or her\nharassing conduct with a particular threatening charac-\nter.\u201d Ellerth, 524 U. S., at 763. See also Faragher, 524\nU.

In short, as Faragher and Ellerth recog-\nnized, harassment by supervisors is more likely to cause\npalpable harm and to persist unabated than similar con-\nduct by fellow employees.\n                               II\n   While Faragher and Ellerth differentiated harassment\nby supervisors from harassment by co-workers, neither\ndecision gave a definitive answer to the question: Who\nqualifies as a supervisor? Two views have emerged. One\nview, in line with the EEOC\u2019s Guidance, counts as a\nsupervisor anyone with authority to take tangible employ-\nment actions or to direct an employee\u2019s daily work activi-\nties. E.g., Mack v. Otis Elevator Co., 326 F. 3d 116, 127\n(CA2 2003); Whitten v. Fred\u2019s, Inc., 601 F. 3d 231, 246\n(CA4 2010); EEOC Guidance 405:7654. The other view\nranks as supervisors only those authorized to take tangi-\nble employment actions. E.g., Noviello v. Boston, 398\nF. 3d 76, 96 (CA1 2005); Parkins v. Civil Constructors of\nIll., Inc., 163 F. 3d 1027, 1034 (CA7 1998); Joens v. John\nMorrell & Co., 354 F. 3d 938, 940\u2013941 (CA8 2004).\n   Notably, respondent Ball State University agreed with\npetitioner Vance and the United States, as amicus curiae,\nthat the tangible-employment-action-only test \u201cdoes not\nnecessarily capture all employees who may qualify as\nsupervisors.\u201d Brief for Respondent 1. \u201c[V]icarious liabil-\nity,\u201d Ball State acknowledged, \u201calso may be triggered\nwhen the harassing employee has the authority to control\nthe victim\u2019s daily work activities in a way that materially\nenables the harassment.\u201d Id., at 1\u20132.\n   The different view taken by the Court today is out of\naccord with the agency principles that, Faragher and\nEllerth affirmed, govern Title VII. See supra, at 3\u20134. It is\nblind to the realities of the workplace, and it discounts the\nguidance of the EEOC, the agency Congress established to\ninterpret, and superintend the enforcement of, Title VII.\n6               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nUnder that guidance, the appropriate question is: Has\nthe employer given the alleged harasser authority to take\ntangible employment actions or to control the conditions\nunder which subordinates do their daily work? If the\nanswer to either inquiry is yes, vicarious liability is in\norder, for the superior-subordinate working arrangement\nfacilitating the harassment is of the employer\u2019s making.\n                              A\n   Until today, our decisions have assumed that employees\nwho direct subordinates\u2019 daily work are supervisors. In\nFaragher, the city of Boca Raton, Florida, employed Bill\nTerry and David Silverman to oversee the city\u2019s corps of\nocean lifeguards. 524 U. S., at 780. Terry and Silverman\n\u201crepeatedly subject[ed] Faragher and other female life-\nguards to uninvited and offensive touching,\u201d and they\nregularly \u201cma[de] lewd remarks, and [spoke] of women in\noffensive terms.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nTerry told a job applicant that \u201cfemale lifeguards had sex\nwith their male counterparts,\u201d and then \u201casked whether\nshe would do the same.\u201d Id., at 782. Silverman threat-\nened to assign Faragher to toilet-cleaning duties for a year\nif she refused to date him. Id., at 780. In words and\nconduct, Silverman and Terry made the beach a hostile\nplace for women to work.\n   As Chief of Boca Raton\u2019s Marine Safety Division, Terry\nhad authority to \u201chire new lifeguards (subject to the ap-\nproval of higher management), to supervise all aspects of\nthe lifeguards\u2019 work assignments, to engage in counseling,\nto deliver oral reprimands, and to make a record of any\nsuch discipline.\u201d Id., at 781. Silverman\u2019s duties as a\nMarine Safety lieutenant included \u201cmaking the lifeguards\u2019\ndaily assignments, and . . . supervising their work and\nfitness training.\u201d Ibid. Both men \u201cwere granted virtually\nunchecked authority over their subordinates, directly\ncontrolling and supervising all aspects of Faragher\u2019s day-\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   7\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nto-day activities.\u201d Id., at 808 (internal quotation marks\nand brackets omitted).\n   We may assume that Terry would fall within the defini-\ntion of supervisor the Court adopts today. See ante, at 9.1\nBut nothing in the Faragher record shows that Silver-\nman would. Silverman had oversight and assignment\nresponsibilities\u2014he could punish lifeguards who would not\ndate him with full-time toilet-cleaning duty\u2014but there\nwas no evidence that he had authority to take tangible\nemployment actions. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at 780\u2013781.\nHolding that Boca Raton was vicariously liable for Silver-\nman\u2019s harassment, id., at 808\u2013809, the Court characterized\nhim as Faragher\u2019s supervisor, see id., at 780, and there\nwas no dissent on that point, see id., at 810 (THOMAS, J.,\ndissenting).\n   Subsequent decisions reinforced Faragher\u2019s use of the\nterm \u201csupervisor\u201d to encompass employees with authority\nto direct the daily work of their victims. In Pennsylvania\nState Police v. Suders, 542 U. S. 129, 140 (2004), for ex-\nample, the Court considered whether a constructive dis-\ncharge occasioned by supervisor harassment ranks as a\ntangible employment action. The harassing employees\nlacked authority to discharge or demote the complainant,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 It is not altogether evident that Terry would qualify under the\n\nCourt\u2019s test. His authority to hire was subject to approval by higher\nmanagement, Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775, 781 (1998), and\nthere is scant indication that he possessed other powers on the Court\u2019s\nlist. The Court observes that Terry was able to \u201crecommen[d],\u201d and\n\u201cinitiat[e]\u201d tangible employment actions. Ante, at 15, n. 8 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Nothing in the Faragher record, however,\nshows that Terry had authority to take such actions himself. Far-\nagher\u2019s complaint alleged that Terry said he would never promote a\nfemale lifeguard to the rank of lieutenant, 524 U. S., at 780, but that\nstatement hardly suffices to establish that he had ultimate promotional\nauthority. Had Boca Raton anticipated the position the Court today\nannounces, the city might have urged classification of Terry as Far-\nagher\u2019s superior, but not her \u201csupervisor.\u201d\n8               VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nbut they were \u201cresponsible for the day-to-day supervi-\nsion\u201d of the workplace and for overseeing employee shifts.\nSuders v. Easton, 325 F. 3d 432, 450, n. 11 (CA3 2003).\nDescribing the harassing employees as the complainant\u2019s\n\u201csupervisors,\u201d the Court proceeded to evaluate the com-\nplainant\u2019s constructive discharge claim under the Ellerth\nand Faragher framework. Suders, 542 U. S., at 134, 140\u2013\n141.\n  It is true, as the Court says, ante, at 15\u201317, and n. 11,\nthat Faragher and later cases did not squarely resolve\nwhether an employee without power to take tangible em-\nployment actions may nonetheless qualify as a supervisor.\nBut in laboring to establish that Silverman\u2019s supervi-\nsor status, undisputed in Faragher, is not dispositive here,\nthe Court misses the forest for the trees. Faragher illus-\ntrates an all-too-plain reality: A supervisor with authority\nto control subordinates\u2019 daily work is no less aided in his\nharassment than is a supervisor with authority to fire,\ndemote, or transfer. That Silverman could threaten Far-\nagher with toilet-cleaning duties while Terry could orally\nreprimand her was inconsequential in Faragher, and\nproperly so. What mattered was that both men took ad-\nvantage of the power vested in them as agents of Boca\nRaton to facilitate their abuse. See Faragher, 524 U. S., at\n801 (Silverman and Terry \u201cimplicitly threaten[ed] to mis-\nuse their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or\ncomplaint.\u201d). And when, assisted by an agency relation-\nship, in-charge superiors like Silverman perpetuate a\ndiscriminatory work environment, our decisions have\nappropriately held the employer vicariously liable, subject\nto the above-described affirmative defense. See supra, at\n3\u20134.\n                           B\n Workplace realities fortify my conclusion that harass-\nment by an employee with power to direct subordinates\u2019\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

The following illustrations, none of them\nhypothetical, involve in-charge employees of the kind the\nCourt today excludes from supervisory status.2\n  Yasharay Mack: Yasharay Mack, an African-American\nwoman, worked for the Otis Elevator Company as an\nelevator mechanic\u2019s helper at the Metropolitan Life Build-\ning in New York City. James Connolly, the \u201cmechanic in\ncharge\u201d and the senior employee at the site, targeted Mack\nfor abuse. He commented frequently on her \u201cfantastic\nass,\u201d \u201cluscious lips,\u201d and \u201cbeautiful eyes,\u201d and, using de-\nplorable racial epithets, opined that minorities and women\ndid not \u201cbelong in the business.\u201d Once, he pulled her on\nhis lap, touched her buttocks, and tried to kiss her while\nothers looked on. Connolly lacked authority to take tangi-\nble employment actions against mechanic\u2019s helpers, but he\ndid assign their work, control their schedules, and direct\nthe particulars of their workdays. When he became angry\nwith Mack, for example, he denied her overtime hours.\nAnd when she complained about the mistreatment, he\nscoffed, \u201cI get away with everything.\u201d See Mack, 326\nF. 3d, at 120\u2013121, 125\u2013126 (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  Donna Rhodes: Donna Rhodes, a seasonal highway\nmaintainer for the Illinois Department of Transportation,\nwas responsible for plowing snow during winter months.\nMichael Poladian was a \u201cLead Lead Worker\u201d and Matt\nMara, a \u201cTechnician\u201d at the maintenance yard where\nRhodes worked. Both men assembled plow crews and\nmanaged the work assignments of employees in Rhodes\u2019s\nposition, but neither had authority to hire, fire, promote,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The illustrative cases reached the appellate level after grants of\nsummary judgment in favor of the employer.

In her third\nseason working at the yard, Rhodes was verbally assaulted\nwith sex-based invectives and a pornographic image was\ntaped to her locker. Poladian forced her to wash her\ntruck in sub-zero temperatures, assigned her undesirable\nyard work instead of road crew work, and prohibited\nanother employee from fixing the malfunctioning heating\nsystem in her truck. Conceding that Rhodes had been\nsubjected to a sex-based hostile work environment, the\nDepartment of Transportation argued successfully in the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals that Poladian and\nMara were not Rhodes\u2019s supervisors because they lacked\nauthority to take tangible employment actions against\nher. See Rhodes v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 359 F. 3d 498,\n501\u2013503, 506\u2013507 (CA7 2004).\n   Clara Whitten: Clara Whitten worked at a discount\nretail store in Belton, South Carolina. On Whitten\u2019s first\nday of work, the manager, Matt Green, told her to \u201cgive\n[him] what [he] want[ed]\u201d in order to obtain approval for\nlong weekends off from work. Later, fearing what might\ntranspire, Whitten ignored Green\u2019s order to join him in an\nisolated storeroom. Angered, Green instructed Whitten to\nstay late and clean the store. He demanded that she work\nover the weekend despite her scheduled day off. Dismiss-\ning her as \u201cdumb and stupid,\u201d Green threatened to make\nher life a \u201cliving hell.\u201d Green lacked authority to fire,\npromote, demote, or otherwise make decisions affecting\nWhitten\u2019s pocketbook. But he directed her activities, gave\nher tasks to accomplish, burdened her with undesirable\nwork assignments, and controlled her schedule. He was\nusually the highest ranking employee in the store, and\nboth Whitten and Green considered him the supervisor.\nSee Whitten, 601 F. 3d, at 236, 244\u2013247 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Monika Starke: CRST Van Expedited, Inc., an interstate\ntransit company, ran a training program for newly hired\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Trainees like Starke\nwere paired in a truck cabin with a single \u201clead driver\u201d\nwho lacked authority to hire, fire, promote, or demote, but\nwho exercised control over the work environment for the\nduration of the trip. Lead drivers were responsible for\nproviding instruction on CRST\u2019s driving method, assigning\nspecific tasks, and scheduling rest stops. At the end of the\ntrip, lead drivers evaluated trainees\u2019 performance with a\nnonbinding pass or fail recommendation that could lead to\nfull driver status. Over the course of Starke\u2019s training\ntrip, her first lead driver, Bob Smith, filled the cabin with\nvulgar sexual remarks, commenting on her breast size and\ncomparing the gear stick to genitalia. A second lead driver,\nDavid Goodman, later forced her into unwanted sex with\nhim, an outrage to which she submitted, believing it\nnecessary to gain a passing grade. See EEOC v. CRST\nVan Expedited, Inc., 679 F. 3d 657, 665\u2013666, 684\u2013685\n(CA8 2012).\n   In each of these cases, a person vested with authority to\ncontrol the conditions of a subordinate\u2019s daily work life\nused his position to aid his harassment. But in none of\nthem would the Court\u2019s severely confined definition of su-\npervisor yield vicarious liability for the employer. The\nsenior elevator mechanic in charge, the Court today tells\nus, was Mack\u2019s co-worker, not her supervisor. So was the\nstore manager who punished Whitten with long hours for\nrefusing to give him what he wanted. So were the lead\ndrivers who controlled all aspects of Starke\u2019s working\nenvironment, and the yard worker who kept other employ-\nees from helping Rhodes to control the heat in her truck.\n   As anyone with work experience would immediately\ngrasp, James Connolly, Michael Poladian, Matt Mara,\nMatt Green, Bob Smith, and David Goodman wielded\nemployer-conferred supervisory authority over their vic-\ntims.

BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nthe light it casts.5\n   That the Court has adopted a standard, rather than a\nclear rule, is not surprising, for no crisp definition of su-\npervisor could supply the unwavering line the Court de-\nsires. Supervisors, like the workplaces they manage, come\nin all shapes and sizes. Whether a pitching coach super-\nvises his pitchers (can he demote them?), or an artistic\ndirector supervises her opera star (can she impose signifi-\ncantly different responsibilities?), or a law firm associate\nsupervises the firm\u2019s paralegals (can she fire them?) are\nmatters not susceptible to mechanical rules and on-off\nswitches. One cannot know whether an employer has\nvested supervisory authority in an employee, and whether\nharassment is aided by that authority, without looking to\nthe particular working relationship between the harasser\nand the victim. That is why Faragher and Ellerth crafted\nan employer liability standard embracive of all whose\nauthority significantly aids in the creation and perpetua-\ntion of harassment.\n   The Court\u2019s focus on finding a definition of supervisor\ncapable of instant application is at odds with the Court\u2019s\nordinary emphasis on the importance of particular circum-\nstances in Title VII cases. See, e.g., Burlington Northern,\n548 U. S., at 69 (\u201c[T]he significance of any given act of\nretaliation will often depend upon the particular circum-\nstances.\u201d); Harris, 510 U. S., at 23 (\u201c[W]hether an envi-\nronment is \u2018hostile\u2019 or \u2018abusive\u2019 can be determined only by\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Even the Seventh Circuit, whose definition of supervisor the Court\n\nadopts in large measure, has candidly acknowledged that, under its\ndefinition, supervisor status is not a clear and certain thing. See Doe v.\nOberweis Dairy, 456 F. 3d 704, 717 (2006) (\u201cThe difficulty of classifica-\ntion in this case arises from the fact that Nayman, the shift supervisor,\nwas in between the paradigmatic classes [of supervisor and co-worker].\nHe had supervisory responsibility in the sense of authority to direct the\nwork of the [ice-cream] scoopers, and he was even authorized to issue\ndisciplinary write-ups, but he had no authority to fire them. He was\neither an elevated coworker or a diminished supervisor.\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    17\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nlooking at all the circumstances.\u201d).6 The question of\nsupervisory status, no less than the question whether retali-\nation or harassment has occurred, \u201cdepends on a constella-\ntion of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and\nrelationships.\u201d Oncale, 523 U. S., at 81\u201382. The EEOC\u2019s\nGuidance so perceives.\n                              B\n   As a consequence of the Court\u2019s truncated conception of\nsupervisory authority, the Faragher and Ellerth frame-\nwork has shifted in a decidedly employer-friendly direc-\ntion. This realignment will leave many harassment\nvictims without an effective remedy and undermine Title\nVII\u2019s capacity to prevent workplace harassment.\n   The negligence standard allowed by the Court, see ante,\nat 24, scarcely affords the protection the Faragher and\nEllerth framework gave victims harassed by those in\ncontrol of their lives at work. Recall that an employer is\nnegligent with regard to harassment only if it knew or\nshould have known of the conduct but failed to take ap-\npropriate corrective action. See 29 CFR \u00a71604.11(d);\nEEOC Guidance 405:7652 to 405:7653. It is not uncom-\nmon for employers to lack actual or constructive notice of a\nharassing employee\u2019s conduct. See Lindemann & Gross-\nman 1378\u20131379. An employee may have a reputation as a\nharasser among those in his vicinity, but if no complaint\nmakes its way up to management, the employer will es-\ncape liability under a negligence standard. Id., at 1378.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 The Court worries that the EEOC\u2019s definition of supervisor will\n\nconfound jurors who must first determine whether the harasser is a\nsupervisor and second apply the correct employer liability standard.\nAnte, at 22\u201324, and nn. 13, 14. But the Court can point to no evidence\nthat jury instructions on supervisor status in jurisdictions following the\nEEOC Guidance have in fact proved unworkable or confusing to jurors.\nMoreover, under the Court\u2019s definition of supervisor, jurors in many\ncases will be obliged to determine, as a threshold question, whether the\nalleged harasser possessed supervisory authority. See supra, at 15\u201316.\n18              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Faragher is illustrative. After enduring unrelenting\nharassment, Faragher reported Terry\u2019s and Silverman\u2019s\nconduct informally to Robert Gordon, another immediate\nsupervisor. 524 U. S., at 782\u2013783. But the lifeguards\nwere \u201ccompletely isolated from the City\u2019s higher manage-\nment,\u201d and it did not occur to Faragher to pursue the\nmatter with higher ranking city officials distant from the\nbeach. Id., at 783, 808 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nApplying a negligence standard, the Eleventh Circuit held\nthat, despite the pervasiveness of the harassment, and\ndespite Gordon\u2019s awareness of it, Boca Raton lacked con-\nstructive notice and therefore escaped liability. Id., at\n784\u2013785. Under the vicarious liability standard, however,\nBoca Raton could not make out the affirmative defense, for\nit had failed to disseminate a policy against sexual har-\nassment. Id., at 808\u2013809.\n   On top of the substantive differences in the negligence\nand vicarious liability standards, harassment victims,\nunder today\u2019s decision, are saddled with the burden of\nproving the employer\u2019s negligence whenever the harasser\nlacks the power to take tangible employment actions.\nFaragher and Ellerth, by contrast, placed the burden\nsquarely on the employer to make out the affirmative\ndefense. See Suders, 542 U. S., at 146 (citing Ellerth, 524\nU. S., at 765; Faragher, 524 U. S., at 807). This allocation\nof the burden was both sensible and deliberate: An em-\nployer has superior access to evidence bearing on whether\nit acted reasonably to prevent or correct harassing behav-\nior, and superior resources to marshal that evidence. See\n542 U. S., at 146, n. 7 (\u201cThe employer is in the best posi-\ntion to know what remedial procedures it offers to employ-\nees and how those procedures operate.\u201d).\n   Faced with a steeper substantive and procedural hill to\nclimb, victims like Yasharay Mack, Donna Rhodes, Clara\nWhitten, and Monika Starke likely will find it impossible\nto obtain redress. We can expect that, as a consequence of\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  19\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nrestricting the supervisor category to those formally em-\npowered to take tangible employment actions, victims of\nworkplace harassment with meritorious Title VII claims\nwill find suit a hazardous endeavor.7\n   Inevitably, the Court\u2019s definition of supervisor will\nhinder efforts to stamp out discrimination in the work-\nplace. Because supervisors are comparatively few, and\nemployees are many, \u201cthe employer has a greater oppor-\ntunity to guard against misconduct by supervisors than by\ncommon workers,\u201d and a greater incentive to \u201cscreen\n[supervisors], train them, and monitor their performance.\u201d\nFaragher, 524 U. S., at 803. Vicarious liability for em-\nployers serves this end. When employers know they will\nbe answerable for the injuries a harassing jobsite boss\ninflicts, their incentive to provide preventative instruction\nis heightened. If vicarious liability is confined to supervi-\nsors formally empowered to take tangible employment\nactions, however, employers will have a diminished incen-\ntive to train those who control their subordinates\u2019 work\nactivities and schedules, i.e., the supervisors who \u201cactually\ninteract\u201d with employees. Ante, at 26.\n                            IV\n  I turn now to the case before us. Maetta Vance worked\nas substitute server and part-time catering assistant for\nBall State University\u2019s Banquet and Catering Division.\nDuring the period in question, she alleged, Saundra Davis,\na catering specialist, and other Ball State employees\nsubjected her to a racially hostile work environment.\nApplying controlling Circuit precedent, the District Court\nand Seventh Circuit concluded that Davis was not Vance\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 Nor is the Court\u2019s confinement of supervisor status needed to deter\n\ninsubstantial claims. Under the EEOC Guidance, a plaintiff must meet\nthe threshold requirement of actionable harassment and then show\nthat her supervisor\u2019s authority was of \u201csufficient magnitude\u201d to assist\nin the harassment. See EEOC Guidance 405:7652, 405:7654.\n20                  VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nsupervisor, and reviewed Ball State\u2019s liability for her\nconduct under a negligence standard. 646 F. 3d 461, 470\u2013\n471 (2011); App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a\u201355a, 59a\u201360a. Because\nI would hold that the Seventh Circuit erred in restrict-\ning supervisor status to employees formally empowered\nto take tangible employment actions, I would remand\nfor application of the proper standard to Vance\u2019s claim.\nOn this record, however, there is cause to anticipate that\nDavis would not qualify as Vance\u2019s supervisor.8\n  Supervisor status is based on \u201cjob function rather than\njob title,\u201d and depends on \u201cspecific facts\u201d about the work-\ning relationship. EEOC Guidance 405:7654. See supra, at\n13. Vance has adduced scant evidence that Davis con-\ntrolled the conditions of her daily work. Vance stated in\nan affidavit that the general manager of the Catering\nDivision, Bill Kimes, was charged with \u201coverall supervi-\nsion in the kitchen,\u201d including \u201creassign[ing] people to\nperform different tasks,\u201d and \u201ccontrol[ling] the schedule.\u201d\nApp. 431. The chef, Shannon Fultz, assigned tasks by\npreparing \u201cprep lists\u201d of daily duties. Id., at 277\u2013279, 427.\nThere is no allegation that Davis had a hand in creating\nthese prep lists, nor is there any indication that, in fact,\nDavis otherwise controlled the particulars of Vance\u2019s\nworkday. Vance herself testified that she did not know\nwhether Davis was her supervisor. Id., at 198.\n  True, Davis\u2019 job description listed among her responsi-\nbilities \u201c[l]ead[ing] and direct[ing] kitchen part-time,\nsubstitute, and student employee helpers via demonstra-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 In addition to concluding that Davis was not Vance\u2019s supervisor, the\nDistrict Court held that the conduct Vance alleged was \u201cneither suffi-\nciently severe nor pervasive to be considered objectively hostile for the\npurposes of Title VII.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. The Seventh Circuit\ndeclined to address this issue. See 646 F. 3d 461, 471 (2011). If the\ncase were remanded, the Court of Appeals could resolve the hostile\nenvironment issue first, and then, if necessary, Davis\u2019 status as super-\nvisor or co-worker.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    21\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ntion, coaching, and overseeing their work.\u201d Id., at 13. And\nanother employee testified to believing that Davis was \u201ca\nsupervisor.\u201d Id., at 386. But because the supervisor-\nstatus inquiry should focus on substance, not labels or\npaper descriptions, it is doubtful that this slim evidence\nwould enable Vance to survive a motion for summary\njudgment. Nevertheless, I would leave it to the Seventh\nCircuit to decide, under the proper standard for super-\nvisory status, what impact, if any, Davis\u2019 job description\nand the co-worker\u2019s statement should have on the deter-\nmination of Davis\u2019 status.9\n                              V\n  Regrettably, the Court has seized upon Vance\u2019s thin\ncase to narrow the definition of supervisor, and thereby\nmanifestly limit Title VII\u2019s protections against workplace\nharassment. Not even Ball State, the defendant-employer\nin this case, has advanced the restrictive definition the\nCourt adopts. See supra, at 5. Yet the Court, insistent on\nconstructing artificial categories where context should be\nkey, proceeds on an immoderate and unrestrained course\nto corral Title VII.\n  Congress has, in the recent past, intervened to correct\nthis Court\u2019s wayward interpretations of Title VII. See\nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 123 Stat. 5, super-\nseding Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S.\n618 (2007). See also Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat.\n1071, superseding in part, Lorance v. AT&T Technologies,\nInc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755\n(1989); Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The Court agrees that Davis \u201cwould probably not qualify\u201d as Vance\u2019s\n\nsupervisor under the EEOC\u2019s definition. Ante, at 28\u201329. Then why,\none might ask, does the Court nevertheless reach out to announce its\nrestrictive standard in this case, one in which all parties, including the\ndefendant-employer, accept the fitness for Title VII of the EEOC\u2019s\nGuidance? See supra, at 5.\n22              VANCE v. BALL STATE UNIV.\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n(1989); and Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228\n(1989). The ball is once again in Congress\u2019 court to correct\nthe error into which this Court has fallen, and to restore\nthe robust protections against workplace harassment the\nCourt weakens today.\n                       *     *   *\n  For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of\nthe Seventh Circuit and remand the case for application of\nthe proper standard for determining who qualifies as a\nsupervisor.\n</pre>",
