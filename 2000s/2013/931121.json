NASSAR\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12–484.      Argued April 24, 2013—Decided June 24, 2013\nPetitioner, a university medical center (University) that is part of the\n  University of Texas system, specializes in medical education. It has\n  an affiliation agreement with Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospi-\n  tal), which requires the Hospital to offer vacant staff physician posts\n  to University faculty members. Respondent, a physician of Middle\n  Eastern descent who was both a University faculty member and a\n  Hospital staff physician, claimed that Dr. Levine, one of his supervi-\n  sors at the University, was biased against him on account of his reli-\n  gion and ethnic heritage. He complained to Dr. Fitz, Levine’s super-\n  visor. But after he arranged to continue working at the Hospital\n  without also being on the University’s faculty, he resigned his teach-\n  ing post and sent a letter to Fitz and others, stating that he was leav-\n  ing because of Levine’s harassment. Fitz, upset at Levine’s public\n  humiliation and wanting public exoneration for her, objected to the\n  Hospital’s job offer, which was then withdrawn. Respondent filed\n  suit, alleging two discrete Title VII violations. First, he alleged that\n  Levine’s racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted\n  in his constructive discharge from the University, in violation of 42\n  U. S. C. §2000e–2(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminat-\n  ing against an employee “because of such individual’s race, color, re-\n  ligion, sex, and national origin” (referred to here as status-based dis-\n  crimination). Second, he claimed that Fitz’s efforts to prevent the\n  Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about\n  Levine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a), which prohibits\n  employer retaliation “because [an employee] has opposed . . . an un-\n  lawful employment practice . . . or . . . made a [Title VII] charge.”\n  The jury found for respondent on both claims. The Fifth Circuit va-\n2         UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                      CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                           Syllabus\n\n\n    cated as to the constructive-discharge claim, but affirmed as to the\n    retaliation finding on the theory that retaliation claims brought un-\n    der §2000e–3(a)—like §2000e–2(a) status-based claims—require only\n    a showing that retaliation was a motivating factor for the adverse\n    employment action, not its but-for cause, see §2000e–2(m). And it\n    found that the evidence supported a finding that Fitz was motivated,\n    at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for his complaints\n    about Levine.\nHeld: Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to tradi-\n tional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test\n stated in §2000e–2(m). Pp. 5–23.\n     (a) In defining the proper causation standard for Title VII retalia-\n tion claims, it is presumed that Congress incorporated tort law’s cau-\n sation in fact standard—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in\n fact cause the plaintiff’s injury—absent an indication to the contrary\n in the statute itself. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285. An em-\n ployee alleging status-based discrimination under §2000e–2 need not\n show “but-for” causation. It suffices instead to show that the motive\n to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives, even if the em-\n ployer also had other, lawful motives for the decision. This principle\n is the result of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, and the\n ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which substituted a new\n burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.\n As relevant here, that Act added a new subsection to §2000e–2,\n providing that “an unlawful employment practice is established when\n the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or\n national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,\n even though other factors also motivated the practice,” §2000e–2(m).\n     Also relevant here is this Court’s decision in Gross v. FBL Finan­\n cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176, which interprets the Age Dis-\n crimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) phrase “because of\n . . . age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Gross holds two insights that inform\n the analysis of this case. The first is textual and concerns the proper\n interpretation of the term “because” as it relates to the principles of\n causation underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second is\n the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both Title VII itself\n and the 1991 Act. Pp. 5–11.\n     (b) Title VII’s antiretaliation provision appears in a different sec-\n tion from its status-based discrimination ban. And, like §623(a)(1),\n the ADEA provision in Gross, §2000e–3(a) makes it unlawful for an\n employer to take adverse employment action against an employee\n “because” of certain criteria. Given the lack of any meaningful textu-\n al difference between §2000e–3(a) and §623(a)(1), the proper conclu-\n sion is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nto retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment ac-\ntion. Respondent and the United States maintain that §2000e–2(m)’s\nmotivating-factor test applies, but that reading is flawed. First, it is\ninconsistent with the provision’s plain language, which addresses on-\nly race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination and\nsays nothing about retaliation. Second, their reading is inconsistent\nwith the statute’s design and structure. Congress inserted the moti-\nvating-factor provision as a subsection within §2000e–2, which deals\nonly with status-based discrimination. The conclusion that Congress\nacted deliberately in omitting retaliation claims from §2000–2(m) is\nreinforced by the fact that another part of the 1991 Act, §109, ex-\npressly refers to all unlawful employment actions. See EEOC v. Ara­\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256. Third, the cases they rely\non, which state the general proposition that Congress’ enactment of a\nbroadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant\nintent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrim-\nination, see, e.g., CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442,\n452–453; Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, do not support the\nquite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or\nnationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a syn-\nonym for “retaliation,” especially in a precise, complex, and exhaus-\ntive statute like Title VII. The Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990, which contains seven paragraphs of detailed description of the\npractices constituting prohibited discrimination, as well as an ex-\npress antiretaliation provision, and which was passed only a year be-\nfore §2000e–2(m)’s enactment, shows that when Congress elected to\naddress retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so\nclearly. Pp. 11–17.\n   (c) The proper interpretation and implementation of §2000e–3(a)\nand its causation standard are of central importance to the fair and\nresponsible allocation of resources in the judicial and litigation sys-\ntems, particularly since retaliation claims are being made with ever-\nincreasing frequency. Lessening the causation standard could also\ncontribute to the filing of frivolous claims, siphoning resources from\nefforts by employers, agencies, and courts to combat workplace har-\nassment. Pp. 18–20.\n   (d) Respondent and the Government argue that their view would\nbe consistent with longstanding agency views contained in an Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission guidance manual, but the\nmanual’s explanations for its views lack the persuasive force that is a\nnecessary precondition to deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134, 140. Respondent’s final argument—that if §2000e–\n2(m) does not control, then the Price Waterhouse standard should—is\nforeclosed by the 1991 Act’s amendments to Title VII, which dis-\n4        UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

NAIEL NASSAR\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 24, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When the law grants persons the right to compensation\nfor injury from wrongful conduct, there must be some\ndemonstrated connection, some link, between the injury\nsustained and the wrong alleged. The requisite relation\nbetween prohibited conduct and compensable injury is\ngoverned by the principles of causation, a subject most\noften arising in elaborating the law of torts. This case\nrequires the Court to define those rules in the context of\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e\net seq., which provides remedies to employees for injuries\nrelated to discriminatory conduct and associated wrongs\nby employers.\n   Title VII is central to the federal policy of prohibiting\nwrongful discrimination in the Nation’s workplaces and in\nall sectors of economic endeavor. This opinion discusses\nthe causation rules for two categories of wrongful employer\nconduct prohibited by Title VII. The first type is called,\nfor purposes of this opinion, status-based discrimination.\nThe term is used here to refer to basic workplace protec-\ntion such as prohibitions against employer discrimination\n2       UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                    CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\nin hiring, firing, salary structure, promotion and the like.\nSee §2000e–2(a). The second type of conduct is employer\nretaliation on account of an employee’s having opposed,\ncomplained of, or sought remedies for, unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination. See §2000e–3(a).\n   An employee who alleges status-based discrimination\nunder Title VII need not show that the causal link be-\ntween injury and wrong is so close that the injury would\nnot have occurred but for the act. So-called but-for causa-\ntion is not the test. It suffices instead to show that the\nmotive to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives,\neven if the employer also had other, lawful motives that\nwere causative in the employer’s decision. This principle\nis the result of an earlier case from this Court, Price Water­\nhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), and an ensuing\nstatutory amendment by Congress that codified in part\nand abrogated in part the holding in Price Waterhouse, see\n§§2000e–2(m), 2000e–5(g)(2)(B). The question the Court\nmust answer here is whether that lessened causation\nstandard is applicable to claims of unlawful employer\nretaliation under §2000e–3(a).\n   Although the Court has not addressed the question of\nthe causation showing required to establish liability for a\nTitle VII retaliation claim, it has addressed the issue of\ncausation in general in a case involving employer discrim-\nination under a separate but related statute, the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29\nU. S. C. §623. See Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.,\n557 U. S. 167 (2009). In Gross, the Court concluded that\nthe ADEA requires proof that the prohibited criterion was\nthe but-for cause of the prohibited conduct. The holding\nand analysis of that decision are instructive here.\n                               I\n    Petitioner, the University of Texas Southwestern Medi-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncal Center (University), is an academic institution within\nthe University of Texas system. The University specializes\nin medical education for aspiring physicians, health\nprofessionals, and scientists. Over the years, the Univer-\nsity has affiliated itself with a number of healthcare facili-\nties including, as relevant in this case, Parkland Memorial\nHospital (Hospital). As provided in its affiliation agree-\nment with the University, the Hospital permits the Uni-\nversity’s students to gain clinical experience working in its\nfacilities. The agreement also requires the Hospital to\noffer empty staff physician posts to the University’s faculty\nmembers, see App. 361–362, 366, and, accordingly, most of\nthe staff physician positions at the Hospital are filled by\nthose faculty members.\n   Respondent is a medical doctor of Middle Eastern de-\nscent who specializes in internal medicine and infectious\ndiseases. In 1995, he was hired to work both as a member\nof the University’s faculty and a staff physician at the\nHospital. He left both positions in 1998 for additional\nmedical education and then returned in 2001 as an assis-\ntant professor at the University and, once again, as a\nphysician at the Hospital.\n   In 2004, Dr. Beth Levine was hired as the University’s\nChief of Infectious Disease Medicine. In that position\nLevine became respondent’s ultimate (though not direct)\nsuperior. Respondent alleged that Levine was biased\nagainst him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage,\na bias manifested by undeserved scrutiny of his billing\npractices and productivity, as well as comments that\n“ ‘Middle Easterners are lazy.’ ” 674 F. 3d 448, 450 (CA5\n2012). On different occasions during his employment,\nrespondent met with Dr. Gregory Fitz, the University’s\nChair of Internal Medicine and Levine’s supervisor, to\ncomplain about Levine’s alleged harassment. Despite\nobtaining a promotion with Levine’s assistance in 2006,\nrespondent continued to believe that she was biased\n4      UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nagainst him. So he tried to arrange to continue working\nat the Hospital without also being on the University’s\nfaculty. After preliminary negotiations with the Hospital\nsuggested this might be possible, respondent resigned his\nteaching post in July 2006 and sent a letter to Dr. Fitz\n(among others), in which he stated that the reason for his\ndeparture was harassment by Levine. That harassment,\nhe asserted, “ ‘stems from . . . religious, racial and cultural\nbias against Arabs and Muslims.’ ” Id., at 451. After\nreading that letter, Dr. Fitz expressed consternation at\nrespondent’s accusations, saying that Levine had been\n“publicly humiliated by th[e] letter” and that it was “very\nimportant that she be publicly exonerated.” App. 41.\n   Meanwhile, the Hospital had offered respondent a job as\na staff physician, as it had indicated it would. On learning\nof that offer, Dr. Fitz protested to the Hospital, asserting\nthat the offer was inconsistent with the affiliation agree-\nment’s requirement that all staff physicians also be members\nof the University faculty. The Hospital then withdrew\nits offer.\n   After exhausting his administrative remedies, respond-\nent filed this Title VII suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Texas. He alleged two\ndiscrete violations of Title VII. The first was a status-\nbased discrimination claim under §2000e–2(a). Respondent\nalleged that Dr. Levine’s racially and religiously moti-\nvated harassment had resulted in his constructive dis-\ncharge from the University. Respondent’s second claim\nwas that Dr. Fitz’s efforts to prevent the Hospital from\nhiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Dr.\nLevine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a). 674\nF. 3d, at 452. The jury found for respondent on both\nclaims. It awarded him over $400,000 in backpay and\nmore than $3 million in compensatory damages. The\nDistrict Court later reduced the compensatory damages\naward to $300,000.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed in part and vacated in part. The court first con-\ncluded that respondent had submitted insufficient evi-\ndence in support of his constructive-discharge claim, so it\nvacated that portion of the jury’s verdict. The court af-\nfirmed as to the retaliation finding, however, on the theory\nthat retaliation claims brought under §2000e–3(a)—like\nclaims of status-based discrimination under §2000e–2(a)—\nrequire only a showing that retaliation was a motivating\nfactor for the adverse employment action, rather than its\nbut-for cause. See id., at 454, n. 16 (citing Smith v. Xerox\nCorp., 602 F. 3d 320, 330 (CA5 2010)). It further held that\nthe evidence supported a finding that Dr. Fitz was moti-\nvated, at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for\nhis complaints against Levine. The Court of Appeals then\nremanded for a redetermination of damages in light of its\ndecision to vacate the constructive-discharge verdict.\n   Four judges dissented from the court’s decision not to\nrehear the case en banc, arguing that the Circuit’s appli-\ncation of the motivating-factor standard to retaliation\ncases was “an erroneous interpretation of [Title VII] and\ncontrolling caselaw” and should be overruled en banc. 688\nF. 3d 211, 213–214 (CA5 2012) (Smith, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Certiorari was granted. 568 U.

Causation\nin fact—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in fact\ncause the plaintiff ’s injury—is a standard requirement of\nany tort claim, see Restatement of Torts §9 (1934) (defini-\ntion of “legal cause”); §431, Comment a (same); §279, and\nComment c (intentional infliction of physical harm); §280\n(other intentional torts); §281(c) (negligence).

S. 604, 610\n(1993) (In intentional-discrimination cases, “liability\ndepends on whether the protected trait” “actually motivated\nthe employer’s decision” and “had a determinative in-\nfluence on the outcome”); Los Angeles Dept. of Water and\nPower v. Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 711 (1978) (explaining\nthat the “simple test” for determining a discriminatory\nemployment practice is “whether the evidence shows\ntreatment of a person in a manner which but for that\nperson’s sex would be different” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   In the usual course, this standard requires the plaintiff\nto show “that the harm would not have occurred” in the\nabsence of—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.\nRestatement of Torts §431, Comment a (negligence);\n§432(1), and Comment a (same); see §279, and Comment c\n(intentional infliction of bodily harm); §280 (other inten-\ntional torts); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical and Emotional Harm §27, and Comment b (2010)\n(noting the existence of an exception for cases where an\ninjured party can prove the existence of multiple, inde-\npendently sufficient factual causes, but observing that\n“cases invoking the concept are rare”). See also Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts §432(1) (1963 and 1964) (negli-\ngence claims); §870, Comment l (intentional injury to\nanother); cf. §435a, and Comment a (legal cause for inten-\ntional harm). It is thus textbook tort law that an action “is\nnot regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event\nwould have occurred without it.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.\nKeeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts\n265 (5th ed. 1984). This, then, is the background against\nwhich Congress legislated in enacting Title VII, and these\nare the default rules it is presumed to have incorporated,\nabsent an indication to the contrary in the statute itself.\nSee Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285 (2003); Carey v.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPiphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257–258 (1978).\n                              B\n   Since the statute’s passage in 1964, it has prohibited\nemployers from discriminating against their employees on\nany of seven specified criteria. Five of them—race, color,\nreligion, sex, and national origin—are personal character-\nistics and are set forth in §2000e–2. (As noted at the\noutset, discrimination based on these five characteristics\nis called status-based discrimination in this opinion.) And\nthen there is a point of great import for this case: The two\nremaining categories of wrongful employer conduct—the\nemployee’s opposition to employment discrimination, and\nthe employee’s submission of or support for a complaint\nthat alleges employment discrimination—are not wrongs\nbased on personal traits but rather types of protected\nemployee conduct. These latter two categories are covered\nby a separate, subsequent section of Title VII, §2000e–\n3(a).\n   Under the status-based discrimination provision, it is an\n“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to dis-\ncriminate against any individual . . . because of such\nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n§2000e–2(a). In its 1989 decision in Price Waterhouse, the\nCourt sought to explain the causation standard imposed\nby this language. It addressed in particular what it means\nfor an action to be taken “because of ” an individual’s race,\nreligion, or nationality. Although no opinion in that case\ncommanded a majority, six Justices did agree that a plain-\ntiff could prevail on a claim of status-based discrimination\nif he or she could show that one of the prohibited traits\nwas a “motivating” or “substantial” factor in the employ-\ner’s decision. 490 U. S., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at\n259 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 276\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

Id., at\n258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259–260 (opinion of White,\nJ.); id., at 276–277 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). In other\nwords, the employer had to show that a discriminatory\nmotive was not the but-for cause of the adverse employ-\nment action.\n   Two years later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of\n1991 (1991 Act), 105 Stat. 1071. This statute (which had\nmany other provisions) codified the burden-shifting and\nlessened-causation framework of Price Waterhouse in part\nbut also rejected it to a substantial degree. The legislation\nfirst added a new subsection to the end of §2000e–2, i.e.,\nTitle VII’s principal ban on status-based discrimination.\nSee §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075. The new provision, §2000e–\n2(m), states:\n    “[A]n unlawful employment practice is established\n    when the complaining party demonstrates that race,\n    color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating\n    factor for any employment practice, even though other\n    factors also motivated the practice.”\nThis, of course, is a lessened causation standard.\n  The 1991 Act also abrogated a portion of Price Water­\nhouse’s framework by removing the employer’s ability to\ndefeat liability once a plaintiff proved the existence of an\nimpermissible motivating factor. See Gross, 557 U. S., at\n178, n. 5. In its place, Congress enacted §2000e–5(g)(2),\nwhich provides:\n      “(B) On a claim in which an individual proves a vio-\n    lation under section 2000e–2(m) of this title and [the\n    employer] demonstrates that [it] would have taken\n    the same action in the absence of the impermissible\n    motivating factor, the court—\n      “(i) may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief . . .\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    and [limited] attorney’s fees and costs . . . ; and\n       “(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order\n    requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promo-\n    tion, or payment . . . .”\n   So, in short, the 1991 Act substituted a new burden-\nshifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Water­\nhouse. Under that new regime, a plaintiff could obtain\ndeclaratory relief, attorney’s fees and costs, and some\nforms of injunctive relief based solely on proof that race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or nationality was a motivating factor\nin the employment action; but the employer’s proof that it\nwould still have taken the same employment action would\nsave it from monetary damages and a reinstatement\norder. See Gross, 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5; see also id., at\n175, n. 2, 177, n. 3.\n   After Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act, considerable\ntime elapsed before the Court returned again to the mean-\ning of “because” and the problem of causation. This time it\narose in the context of a different, yet similar statute, the\nADEA, 29 U. S. C. §623(a). See Gross, supra. Much like\nthe Title VII statute in Price Waterhouse, the relevant\nportion of the ADEA provided that “ ‘[i]t shall be unlawful\nfor an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi-\nvidual’s age.’ ” 557 U. S., at 176 (quoting §623(a)(1);\nemphasis and ellipsis in original).\n   Concentrating first and foremost on the meaning of the\nphrase “ ‘because of . . . age,’ ” the Court in Gross explained\nthat the ordinary meaning of “ ‘because of ’ ” is “ ‘by reason\nof ’ ” or “ ‘on account of.’ ” Id., at 176 (citing 1 Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 194 (1966); 1 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 746 (1933); The Random House Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 132 (1966); emphasis in\n10     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\noriginal). Thus, the “requirement that an employer took\nadverse action ‘because of ’ age [meant] that age was the\n‘reason’ that the employer decided to act,” or, in other\nwords, that “age was the ‘but-for’ cause of the employer’s\nadverse decision.” 557 U. S., at 176. See also Safeco Ins.\nCo. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63–64, and n. 14\n(2007) (noting that “because of ” means “based on” and\nthat “ ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship”);\nHolmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503\nU. S. 258, 265–266 (1992) (equating “by reason of ” with\n“ ‘but for’ cause”).\n    In the course of approving this construction, Gross\ndeclined to adopt the interpretation endorsed by the plu-\nrality and concurring opinions in Price Waterhouse. Not-\ning that “the ADEA must be ‘read . . . the way Congress\nwrote it,’ ” 557 U. S., at 179 (quoting Meacham v. Knolls\nAtomic Power Laboratory, 554 U. S. 84, 102 (2008)), the\nCourt concluded that “the textual differences between\nTitle VII and the ADEA” “prevent[ed] us from applying\nPrice Waterhouse . . . to federal age discrimination claims,”\n557 U. S., at 175, n. 2. In particular, the Court stressed\nthe congressional choice not to add a provision like\n§2000e–2(m) to the ADEA despite making numerous other\nchanges to the latter statute in the 1991 Act. Id., at 174–\n175 (citing EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.\n244, 256 (1991)); 557 U. S., at 177, n. 3 (citing 14 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 270 (2009)).\n    Finally, the Court in Gross held that it would not be\nproper to read Price Waterhouse as announcing a rule that\napplied to both statutes, despite their similar wording and\nnear-contemporaneous enactment. 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5.\nThis different reading was necessary, the Court concluded,\nbecause Congress’ 1991 amendments to Title VII, includ-\ning its “careful tailoring of the ‘motivating factor’ claim”\nand the substitution of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B) for Price Water­\nhouse’s full affirmative defense, indicated that the moti-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvating-factor standard was not an organic part of Title VII\nand thus could not be read into the ADEA. See 557 U. S.,\nat 178, n. 5.\n   In Gross, the Court was careful to restrict its analysis to\nthe statute before it and withhold judgment on the proper\nresolution of a case, such as this, which arose under Title\nVII rather than the ADEA. But the particular confines of\nGross do not deprive it of all persuasive force. Indeed,\nthat opinion holds two insights for the present case. The\nfirst is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of\nthe term “because” as it relates to the principles of causa-\ntion underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second\nis the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both\nTitle VII itself and the law’s 1991 amendments. These\nprinciples do not decide the present case but do inform its\nanalysis, for the issues possess significant parallels.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  As noted, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision, which is\nset forth in §2000e–3(a), appears in a different section\nfrom Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination. The\nantiretaliation provision states, in relevant part:\n        “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer to discriminate against any of his employees\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an\n    unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or\n    because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.”\n  This enactment, like the statute at issue in Gross,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse em-\nployment action against an employee “because” of certain\ncriteria. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Given the lack of any\nmeaningful textual difference between the text in this\n12     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstatute and the one in Gross, the proper conclusion here,\nas in Gross, is that Title VII retaliation claims require\nproof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of\nthe challenged employment action. See Gross, supra, at\n176.\n   The principal counterargument offered by respondent\nand the United States relies on their different understand-\ning of the motivating-factor section, which—on its face—\napplies only to status discrimination, discrimination on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\nIn substance, they contend that: (1) retaliation is defined\nby the statute to be an unlawful employment practice; (2)\n§2000e–2(m) allows unlawful employment practices to be\nproved based on a showing that race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin was a motivating factor for—and not nec-\nessarily the but-for factor in—the challenged employment\naction; and (3) the Court has, as a matter of course, held\nthat “retaliation for complaining about race discrimination\nis ‘discrimination based on race.’ ” Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 14; see id., at 11–14; Brief for Respond-\nent 16–19.\n   There are three main flaws in this reading of §2000e–\n2(m). The first is that it is inconsistent with the provi-\nsion’s plain language. It must be acknowledged that\nbecause Title VII defines “unlawful employment practice”\nto include retaliation, the question presented by this case\nwould be different if §2000e–2(m) extended its coverage to\nall unlawful employment practices. As actually written,\nhowever, the text of the motivating-factor provision, while\nit begins by referring to “unlawful employment practices,”\nthen proceeds to address only five of the seven prohibited\ndiscriminatory actions—actions based on the employee’s\nstatus, i.e., race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\nThis indicates Congress’ intent to confine that provision’s\ncoverage to only those types of employment practices. The\ntext of §2000e–2(m) says nothing about retaliation claims.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGiven this clear language, it would be improper to con-\nclude that what Congress omitted from the statute is\nnevertheless within its scope. Gardner v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85616\"><a href=\"/scotus/rs9/gardner-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (1829) (“What the legislative intention was, can be\nderived only from the words they have used; and we can-\nnot speculate beyond the reasonable import of these\nwords”); see Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 8).\n   The second problem with this reading is its inconsistency\nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.\nSee Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2, 178, n. 5. Just as Con-\ngress’ choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too\nare its structural choices. See id., at 177, n. 3. When\nCongress wrote the motivating-factor provision in 1991, it\nchose to insert it as a subsection within §2000e–2, which\ncontains Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination,\n§§2000e–2(a) to (d), (l), and says nothing about retaliation.\nSee 1991 Act, §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075 (directing that\n“§2000e–2 . . . [be] further amended by adding at the end\nthe following new subsection . . . (m)”). The title of the\nsection of the 1991 Act that created §2000e–2(m)—\n“Clarifying prohibition against impermissible considera-\ntion of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in\nemployment practices”—also indicates that Congress\ndetermined to address only claims of status-based\ndiscrimination, not retaliation. See §107(a), id., at 1075.\n   What is more, a different portion of the 1991 Act con-\ntains an express reference to all unlawful employment\nactions, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that Congress\nacted deliberately when it omitted retaliation claims from\n§2000e–2(m). See Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S., at\n256 (congressional amendment of ADEA on a similar\nsubject coupled with congressional failure to amend Title\nVII weighs against conclusion that the ADEA’s standard\napplies to Title VII); see also Gross, supra, at 177, n. 3.\nThe relevant portion of the 1991 Act, §109(b), allowed\n14     UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

S. employers to engage\nin “any practice prohibited by section 703 or 704,” i.e.,\n§2000e–2 or §2000e–3, “if compliance with such section\nwould cause such employer . . . to violate the law of the\nforeign country in which such workplace is located.” 105\nStat. 1077.\n    If Congress had desired to make the motivating-factor\nstandard applicable to all Title VII claims, it could have\nused language similar to that which it invoked in §109.\nSee Arabian American Oil Co., supra, at 256. Or, it could\nhave inserted the motivating-factor provision as part of a\nsection that applies to all such claims, such as §2000e–5,\nwhich establishes the rules and remedies for all Title VII\nenforcement actions. See FDA v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160 (2000). But in writing\n§2000e–2(m), Congress did neither of those things, and\n“[w]e must give effect to Congress’ choice.” Gross, supra,\nat 177, n. 3.\n    The third problem with respondent’s and the Govern-\nment’s reading of the motivating-factor standard is in its\nsubmission that this Court’s decisions interpreting federal\nantidiscrimination law have, as a general matter, treated\nbans on status-based discrimination as also prohibiting\nretaliation. In support of this proposition, both respond-\nent and the United States rely upon decisions in which\nthis Court has “read [a] broadly worded civil rights statute\n. . . as including an antiretaliation remedy.” CBOCS West,\nInc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442, 452–453 (2008). In\nCBOCS, for example, the Court held that 42 U. S. C.\n§1981—which declares that all persons “shall have the\nsame right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is\nenjoyed by white citizens”—prohibits not only racial dis-\ncrimination but also retaliation against those who oppose\nit. 553 U. S., at 445. And in Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553\nU. S. 474 (2008), the Court likewise read a bar on retalia-\ntion into the broad wording of the federal-employee provi-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsions of the ADEA. Id., at 479, 487 (“All personnel actions\naffecting [federal] employees . . . who are at least 40 years\nof age . . . shall be made free from any discrimination\nbased on age,” 29 U. S. C. §633a(a)); see also Jackson v.\nBirmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 173, 179 (2005) (20\nU. S. C. §1681(a) (Title IX)); Sullivan v. Little Hunting\nPark, Inc., 396 U. S. 229, 235, n. 3, 237 (1969) (42 U. S. C.\n§1982).\n   These decisions are not controlling here. It is true these\ncases do state the general proposition that Congress’\nenactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute\nmay signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against\nindividuals who oppose that discrimination, even where\nthe statute does not refer to retaliation in so many words.\nWhat those cases do not support, however, is the quite\ndifferent rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex,\nor nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be\ntreated as a synonym for “retaliation.” For one thing,\n§2000e–2(m) is not itself a substantive bar on discrimina-\ntion. Rather, it is a rule that establishes the causation\nstandard for proving a violation defined elsewhere in Title\nVII. The cases cited by respondent and the Government\ndo not address rules of this sort, and those precedents are\nof limited relevance here.\n   The approach respondent and the Government suggest\nis inappropriate in the context of a statute as precise,\ncomplex, and exhaustive as Title VII. As noted, the laws\nat issue in CBOCS, Jackson, and Gómez-Pérez were broad,\ngeneral bars on discrimination. In interpreting them the\nCourt concluded that by using capacious language Con-\ngress expressed the intent to bar retaliation in addition to\nstatus-based discrimination. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at\n486–488. In other words, when Congress’ treatment of the\nsubject of prohibited discrimination was both broad and\nbrief, its omission of any specific discussion of retaliation\nwas unremarkable.\n16     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   If Title VII had likewise been phrased in broad and\ngeneral terms, respondent’s argument might have more\nforce. But that is not how Title VII was written, which\nmakes it incorrect to infer that Congress meant anything\nother than what the text does say on the subject of retalia-\ntion. Unlike Title IX, §1981, §1982, and the federal-sector\nprovisions of the ADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory\nscheme. This statute enumerates specific unlawful em-\nployment practices. See §§2000e–2(a)(1), (b), (c)(1), (d)\n(status-based discrimination by employers, employment\nagencies, labor organizations, and training programs,\nrespectively); §2000e–2(l) (status-based discrimination in\nemployment-related testing); §2000e–3(a) (retaliation for\nopposing, or making or supporting a complaint about,\nunlawful employment actions); §2000e–3(b) (advertising a\npreference for applicants of a particular race, color, reli-\ngion, sex, or national origin). It defines key terms, see\n§2000e, and exempts certain types of employers, see\n§2000e–1. And it creates an administrative agency with\nboth rulemaking and enforcement authority.              See\n§§2000e–5, 2000e–12.\n   This fundamental difference in statutory structure\nrenders inapposite decisions which treated retaliation as\nan implicit corollary of status-based discrimination. Text\nmay not be divorced from context. In light of Congress’\nspecial care in drawing so precise a statutory scheme, it\nwould be improper to indulge respondent’s suggestion that\nCongress meant to incorporate the default rules that apply\nonly when Congress writes a broad and undifferentiated\nstatute. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at 486–488 (when con-\nstruing the broadly worded federal-sector provision of the\nADEA, Court refused to draw inferences from Congress’\namendments to the detailed private-sector provisions);\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S., at 256; cf. Jackson,\nsupra, at 175 (distinguishing Title IX’s “broadly written\ngeneral prohibition on discrimination” from Title VII’s\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“greater detail [with respect to] the conduct that consti-\ntutes discrimination”).\n   Further confirmation of the inapplicability of §2000e–\n2(m) to retaliation claims may be found in Congress’\napproach to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA), 104 Stat. 327. In the ADA Congress provided not\njust a general prohibition on discrimination “because of\n[an individual’s] disability,” but also seven paragraphs of\ndetailed description of the practices that would constitute\nthe prohibited discrimination, see §§102(a), (b)(1)–(7), id.,\nat 331–332 (codified at 42 U. S. C. §12112). And, most\npertinent for present purposes, it included an express\nantiretaliation provision, see §503(a), 104 Stat. 370 (codi-\nfied at 42 U. S. C. §12203). That law, which Congress\npassed only a year before enacting §2000e–2(m) and which\nspeaks in clear and direct terms to the question of retalia-\ntion, rebuts the claim that Congress must have intended\nto use the phrase “race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin” as the textual equivalent of “retaliation.” To the\ncontrary, the ADA shows that when Congress elected to\naddress retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme,\nit did so in clear textual terms.\n   The Court confronted a similar structural dispute in\nLehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981). The question\nthere was whether the federal-employment provisions of\nthe ADEA, 29 U. S. C. §633a, provided a jury-trial right\nfor claims against the Federal Government. Nakshian,\n453 U. S., at 157. In concluding that it did not, the Court\nnoted that the portion of the ADEA that prohibited age\ndiscrimination by private, state, and local employers,\n§626, expressly provided for a jury trial, whereas the\nfederal-sector provisions said nothing about such a right.\nId., at 162–163, 168. So, too, here. Congress has in explic-\nit terms altered the standard of causation for one class of\nclaims but not another, despite the obvious opportunity to\ndo so in the 1991 Act.\n18     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n   The proper interpretation and implementation of\n§2000e–3(a) and its causation standard have central im-\nportance to the fair and responsible allocation of resources\nin the judicial and litigation systems. This is of particular\nsignificance because claims of retaliation are being made\nwith ever-increasing frequency. The number of these\nclaims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) has nearly doubled in the past 15\nyears—from just over 16,000 in 1997 to over 31,000\nin 2012. EEOC, Charge Statistics FY 1997 Through\nFY 2012, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/\ncharges.cfm (as visited June 20, 2013, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). Indeed, the number of retalia-\ntion claims filed with the EEOC has now outstripped those\nfor every type of status-based discrimination except race.\nSee ibid.\n   In addition lessening the causation standard could also\ncontribute to the filing of frivolous claims, which would\nsiphon resources from efforts by employer, administrative\nagencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.\nConsider in this regard the case of an employee who\nknows that he or she is about to be fired for poor perform-\nance, given a lower pay grade, or even just transferred to\na different assignment or location. To forestall that lawful\naction, he or she might be tempted to make an unfounded\ncharge of racial, sexual, or religious discrimination; then,\nwhen the unrelated employment action comes, the em-\nployee could allege that it is retaliation. If respondent\nwere to prevail in his argument here, that claim could be\nestablished by a lessened causation standard, all in order\nto prevent the undesired change in employment circum-\nstances. Even if the employer could escape judgment after\ntrial, the lessened causation standard would make it far\nmore difficult to dismiss dubious claims at the summary\njudgment stage. Cf. Vance v. Ball State Univ., post, at 9–\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n11. It would be inconsistent with the structure and opera-\ntion of Title VII to so raise the costs, both financial and\nreputational, on an employer whose actions were not in\nfact the result of any discriminatory or retaliatory intent.\nSee Brief for National School Boards Association as Ami­\ncus Curiae 11–22. Yet there would be a significant risk of\nthat consequence if respondent’s position were adopted\nhere.\n   The facts of this case also demonstrate the legal and\nfactual distinctions between status-based and retaliation\nclaims, as well as the importance of the correct standard of\nproof. Respondent raised both claims in the District\nCourt. The alleged wrongdoer differed in each: In re-\nspondent’s status-based discrimination claim, it was his\nindirect supervisor, Dr. Levine. In his retaliation claim, it\nwas the Chair of Internal Medicine, Dr. Fitz. The proof\nrequired for each claim differed, too. For the status-based\nclaim, respondent was required to show instances of racial\nslurs, disparate treatment, and other indications of\nnationality-driven animus by Dr. Levine. Respondent’s\nretaliation claim, by contrast, relied on the theory that Dr.\nFitz was committed to exonerating Dr. Levine and wished\nto punish respondent for besmirching her reputation.\nSeparately instructed on each type of claim, the jury re-\nturned a separate verdict for each, albeit with a single\ndamages award. And the Court of Appeals treated each\nclaim separately, too, finding insufficient evidence on the\nclaim of status-based discrimination.\n   If it were proper to apply the motivating-factor standard\nto respondent’s retaliation claim, the University might\nwell be subject to liability on account of Dr. Fitz’s alleged\ndesire to exonerate Dr. Levine, even if it could also be\nshown that the terms of the affiliation agreement pre-\ncluded the Hospital’s hiring of respondent and that the\nUniversity would have sought to prevent respondent’s\nhiring in order to honor that agreement in any event.

NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nresult would be inconsistent with the both the text and\npurpose of Title VII.\n   In sum, Title VII defines the term “unlawful employ-\nment practice” as discrimination on the basis of any of\nseven prohibited criteria: race, color, religion, sex, national\norigin, opposition to employment discrimination, and\nsubmitting or supporting a complaint about employment\ndiscrimination. The text of §2000e–2(m) mentions just the\nfirst five of these factors, the status-based ones; and it\nomits the final two, which deal with retaliation. When it\nadded §2000e–2(m) to Title VII in 1991, Congress inserted\nit within the section of the statute that deals only with\nthose same five criteria, not the section that deals with\nretaliation claims or one of the sections that apply to all\nclaims of unlawful employment practices. And while the\nCourt has inferred a congressional intent to prohibit retal-\niation when confronted with broadly worded antidiscrimi-\nnation statutes, Title VII’s detailed structure makes that\ninference inappropriate here. Based on these textual and\nstructural indications, the Court now concludes as follows:\nTitle VII retaliation claims must be proved according to\ntraditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened\ncausation test stated in §2000e–2(m). This requires proof\nthat the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in\nthe absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the\nemployer.\n                            IV\n  Respondent and the Government also argue that apply-\ning the motivating-factor provision’s lessened causation\nstandard to retaliation claims would be consistent with\nlongstanding agency views, contained in a guidance man-\nual published by the EEOC. It urges that those views are\nentitled to deference under this Court’s decision in Skid­\nmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944). See National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n110, n. 6 (2002). The weight of deference afforded to\nagency interpretations under Skidmore depends upon “the\nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of\nits reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pro-\nnouncements, and all those factors which give it power to\npersuade.” 323 U. S., at 140; see Vance, post, at 9, n. 4.\n   According to the manual in question, the causation\nelement of a retaliation claim is satisfied if “there is credi-\nble direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the\nchallenged action,” regardless of whether there is also\n“[e]vidence as to [a] legitimate motive.” 2 EEOC Compli-\nance Manual §8–II(E)(1), pp. 614:0007–614:0008 (Mar.\n2003). After noting a division of authority as to whether\nmotivating-factor or but-for causation should apply to\nretaliation claims, the manual offers two rationales in\nsupport of adopting the former standard. The first is that\n“[c]ourts have long held that the evidentiary framework\nfor proving [status-based] discrimination . . . also applies\nto claims of discrimination based on retaliation.” Id., at\n614:0008, n. 45. Second, the manual states that “an inter-\npretation . . . that permits proven retaliation to go unpun-\nished undermines the purpose of the anti-retaliation\nprovisions of maintaining unfettered access to the statutory\nremedial mechanism.” Ibid.\n   These explanations lack the persuasive force that is a\nnecessary precondition to deference under Skidmore. See\n323 U. S., at 140; Vance, post, at 9, n. 4. As to the first\nrationale, while the settled judicial construction of a par-\nticular statute is of course relevant in ascertaining statu-\ntory meaning, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580–\n581 (1978), the manual’s discussion fails to address the\nparticular interplay among the status-based discrimina-\ntion provision (§2000e–2(a)), the antiretaliation provision\n(§2000e–3(a)), and the motivating-factor provision\n(§2000e–2(m)). Other federal antidiscrimination statutes\ndo not have the structure of statutory subsections that\n22     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncontrol the outcome at issue here. The manual’s failure to\naddress the specific provisions of this statutory scheme,\ncoupled with the generic nature of its discussion of the\ncausation standards for status-based discrimination and\nretaliation claims, call the manual’s conclusions into\nserious question. See Kentucky Retirement Systems v.\nEEOC, 554 U. S. 135, 149–150 (2008).\n   The manual’s second argument is unpersuasive, too; for\nits reasoning is circular. It asserts the lessened causation\nstandard is necessary in order to prevent “proven retalia-\ntion” from “go[ing] unpunished.” 2 EEOC Compliance\nManual §8–II(E)(1), at 614:0008, n. 45. Yet this assumes\nthe answer to the central question at issue here, which is\nwhat causal relationship must be shown in order to prove\nretaliation.\n   Respondent’s final argument, in which he is not joined\nby the United States, is that even if §2000e–2(m) does not\ncontrol the outcome in this case, the standard applied by\nPrice Waterhouse should control instead. That assertion is\nincorrect. First, this position is foreclosed by the 1991\nAct’s amendments to Title VII. As noted above, Price\nWaterhouse adopted a complex burden-shifting frame-\nwork. Congress displaced this framework by enacting\n§2000e–2(m) (which adopts the motivating-factor standard\nfor status-based discrimination claims) and §2000e–\n5(g)(2)(B) (which replaces employers’ total defense with a\nremedial limitation). See Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2,\n177, n. 3, 178, n. 5. Given the careful balance of lessened\ncausation and reduced remedies Congress struck in the\n1991 Act, there is no reason to think that the different\nbalance articulated by Price Waterhouse somehow sur-\nvived that legislation’s passage. Second, even if this ar-\ngument were still available, it would be inconsistent with\nthe Gross Court’s reading (and the plain textual meaning)\nof the word “because” as it appears in both §623(a) and\n§2000e–3(a).

The University claims that a fair application of this\nstandard, which is more demanding than the motivating-\nfactor standard adopted by the Court of Appeals, entitles\nit to judgment as a matter of law. It asks the Court to so\nhold. That question, however, is better suited to resolu-\ntion by courts closer to the facts of this case. The judg-\nment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

S. C.\n§2000e et seq., makes it an “unlawful employment prac­\ntice” to “discriminate against any individual . . . because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.” §2000e–2(a) (emphasis added). Backing up that\ncore provision, Title VII also makes it an “unlawful em­\nployment practice” to discriminate against any individual\n“because” the individual has complained of, opposed, or\nparticipated in a proceeding about, prohibited discrimina­\ntion. §2000e–3(a) (emphasis added). This form of discrim­\nination is commonly called “retaliation,” although Title VII\nitself does not use that term. The Court has recognized\nthat effective protection against retaliation, the office of\n§2000e–3(a), is essential to securing “a workplace where\nindividuals are not discriminated against because of their\nracial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.” Burling­\nton N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 63 (2006)\n(Burlington Northern). That is so because “fear of retalia­\ntion is the leading reason why people stay silent” about\nthe discrimination they have encountered or observed.\nCrawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and\nDavidson Cty., 555 U. S. 271, 279 (2009) (internal quota­\ntion marks and brackets omitted).\n2      UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

NASSAR\n\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\n   Similarly worded, the ban on discrimination and the ban\non retaliation against a discrimination complainant have\ntraveled together: Title VII plaintiffs often raise the two pro­\nvisions in tandem. Today’s decision, however, drives a\nwedge between the twin safeguards in so-called “mixed­\nmotive” cases. To establish discrimination, all agree, the\ncomplaining party need show only that race, color, reli­\ngion, sex, or national origin was “a motivating factor” in\nan employer’s adverse action; an employer’s proof that\n“other factors also motivated the [action]” will not defeat\nthe discrimination claim. §2000e–2(m). But a retaliation\nclaim, the Court insists, must meet a stricter standard:\nThe claim will fail unless the complainant shows “but-for”\ncausation, i.e., that the employer would not have taken the\nadverse employment action but for a design to retaliate.\n   In so reining in retaliation claims, the Court misappre­\nhends what our decisions teach: Retaliation for complain­\ning about discrimination is tightly bonded to the core pro­\nhibition and cannot be disassociated from it. Indeed,\nthis Court has explained again and again that “retaliation\nin response to a complaint about [proscribed] discrimina­\ntion is discrimination” on the basis of the characteristic\nCongress sought to immunize against adverse employment\naction. Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167,\n179, n. 3 (2005) (emphasis added; internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   The Court shows little regard for the trial judges who\nwill be obliged to charge discrete causation standards\nwhen a claim of discrimination “because of,” e.g., race is\ncoupled with a claim of discrimination “because” the indi­\nvidual has complained of race discrimination. And jurors\nwill puzzle over the rhyme or reason for the dual stand­\nards. Of graver concern, the Court has seized on a provi­\nsion, §2000e–2(m), adopted by Congress as part of an\nendeavor to strengthen Title VII, and turned it into a\nmeasure reducing the force of the ban on retaliation.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

A spe­\ncialist in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, Nassar was a faculty\nmember of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical\nCenter (UTSW) from 1995 until 2006, save for a period\nduring which he left his employment to continue his edu­\ncation. UTSW is affiliated with Parkland Hospital and,\nlike other faculty members at the University, Nassar also\nworked as a physician at the Hospital. Beginning in 2001,\nNassar served as Associate Medical Director of the Hospi­\ntal’s Amelia Court Clinic.\n   Until 2004, Dr. Phillip Keiser, Medical Director of the\nClinic, was Nassar’s principal supervisor. In that year,\nUTSW hired Dr. Beth Levine to oversee the Clinic and to\nsupervise Keiser. Before Levine commenced her employ­\nment at UTSW, she interviewed her potential subordi­\nnates. Meeting with other Clinic doctors for only 15 to 20\nminutes, Levine spent an hour and a half with Nassar,\nengaging in a detailed review of his resume and reading\nfrom a list of prepared questions.

Her criticism\ndid not take into account that Nassar’s salary was funded\nby a federal grant that precluded billing for most of his\nservices. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3.\n  Because of Levine’s hostility, Nassar sought a way to\ncontinue working at the Clinic without falling under her\nsupervision. To that end, Nassar engaged in discussions\nwith the Hospital about dropping his affiliation with\nUTSW and retaining his post at Parkland. Although he\nwas initially told that an affiliation agreement between\nUTSW and Parkland obliged Parkland to fill its staff\nphysician posts with UTSW faculty, talks with the Hos­\npital continued. Eventually, Parkland verbally offered\nNassar a position as a staff physician. See App. 67–71,\n214–216, 326–330.\n  In July 2006, Nassar resigned from his position at\nUTSW. “The primary reason [for his] resignation,” Nassar\nwrote in a letter to Fitz, “[was] the continuing harassment\nand discrimination . . . by . . . Dr. Beth Levine.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Ac­\ncording to Keiser, Nassar’s letter shocked Fitz, who told\nKeiser that, because Levine had been “publicly humili-\nated,” she should be “publicly exonerated.” App. 41.

App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6.\n   On the retaliation claim, the District Court instructed\nthe jury that Nassar “[did] not have to prove that retalia­\ntion was [UTSW’s] only motive, but he [had to] prove that\n[UTSW] acted at least in part to retaliate.” Id., at 47. The\njury found UTSW liable for both constructive discharge\nand retaliation. At the remedial phase, the judge charged\nthe jury not to award damages for “actions which [UTSW]\nprove[d] by a preponderance of the evidence . . . it would\nhave taken even if it had not considered . . . Nassar’s\nprotected activity.” Id., at 42–43. Finding that UTSW\nhad not met its proof burden, the jury awarded Nassar\n$438,167.66 in backpay and $3,187,500 in compensatory\ndamages. Id., at 43–44.1\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in\npart.2 Responding to UTSW’s argument that the District\nCourt erred in instructing the jury on a mixed-motive\ntheory of retaliation, the Fifth Circuit held that the in­\nstruction conformed to Circuit precedent. 674 F. 3d 448,\n454, n. 16 (2012) (citing Smith v.

Antidiscrimination provisions,\nthe Court has reasoned, endeavor to create a workplace\nwhere individuals are not treated differently on account\nof race, ethnicity, religion, or sex.         See Burlington\nNorthern, 548 U. S., at 63. Antiretaliation provisions\n“see[k] to secure that primary objective by preventing an\nemployer from interfering . . . with an employee’s efforts to\nsecure or advance enforcement of [antidiscrimination]\nguarantees.” Ibid. As the Court has comprehended, “Title\nVII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of\nemployees who are willing to file complaints and act as\nwitnesses.” Id., at 67. “ ‘[E]ffective enforcement,’ ” there­\nfore, can “ ‘only be expected if employees . . . [feel] free to\napproach officials with their grievances.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nMitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288,\n292 (1960)). See also Crawford, 555 U. S., at 279.\n   Adverting to the close connection between discrimina­\ntion and retaliation for complaining about discrimination,\nthis Court has held, in a line of decisions unbroken until\ntoday, that a ban on discrimination encompasses retalia­\ntion. In Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S.\n229, 237 (1969), the Court determined that 42 U. S. C.\n§1982, which provides that “[a]ll citizens of the United\nStates shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white\ncitizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\nconvey real and personal property,” protected a white man\nwho suffered retaliation after complaining of discrimina­\ntion against his black tenant. Jackson v. Birmingham\nBoard of Education elaborated on that holding in the\ncontext of sex discrimination. “Retaliation against a per­\nson because [he] has complained of sex discrimination,”\nthe Court found it inescapably evident, “is another form of\nintentional sex discrimination.” 544 U. S., at 173. As the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCourt explained:\n     “Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It\n     is a form of ‘discrimination’ because the complainant is\n     being subject to differential treatment. Moreover, re­\n     taliation is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because\n     it is an intentional response to the nature of the com­\n     plaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.” Id., at\n     173–174 (citations omitted).\n   Jackson interpreted Title IX of the Educational\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a). Noting that\nthe legislation followed three years after Sullivan, the\nCourt found it “not only appropriate but also realistic to\npresume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with\nSullivan and . . . expected its enactment of Title IX to be\ninterpreted in conformity with it.” 544 U. S., at 176 (in­\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n   Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474 (2008), was similarly\nreasoned. The Court there held that the federal-sector\nprovision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §633a(a), barring discrimination\n“based on age,” also proscribes retaliation. 553 U. S., at\n479–491. “What Jackson said about the relationship\nbetween Sullivan and the enactment of Title IX,” the\nCourt observed, “can be said as well about the relation-\nship between Sullivan and the enactment of the ADEA’s\nfederal-sector provision.” Id., at 485. See also CBOCS West,\nInc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442, 447–457 (2008) (retalia­\ntion for race discrimination constitutes discrimination\nbased on race under 42 U. S. C. §1981). There is no sound\nreason in this case to stray from the decisions in Sullivan,\nJackson, Gómez-Pérez, and CBOCS West.\n                          III\n                           A\n  The Title VII provision key here, §2000e–2(m), states\nthat “an unlawful employment practice is established\n8       UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

See 105 Stat. 1071. The amendments were\nintended to provide “additional protections against unlaw­\nful discrimination in employment,” id., §2(3), and to “re­\nspon[d] to a number of . . . decisions by [this Court] that\nsharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness” of antidis­\ncrimination laws, H.

A\nplurality of the Court in that case held that the words\n“because of ” in §2000e–2(a) encompass claims challenging\nan employment decision attributable to “mixed motives,”\ni.e., one motivated by both legitimate and illegitimate\nfactors. See id., at 240–242.4 A Title VII plaintiff, the\nplurality concluded, need show only that a prohibited\nfactor contributed to the employment decision—not that it\nwas the but-for or sole cause. Id., at 240–244. But see id.,\nat 281–282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). An employer would\nnot be liable, however, if it could show by a preponderance\nof the evidence that it would have taken the same action\nabsent the illegitimate motive. Id., at 244–245.\n——————\n  4 Justices White and O’Connor separately concurred and would have\n\nrequired the Title VII plaintiff to show that protected characteristics\nconstituted a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment\ndecision.

See House Report Part II, at\n18. Congress disagreed with the Court, however, insofar\nas the Price Waterhouse decision allowed an employer to\nescape liability by showing that the same action would\nhave been taken regardless of improper motive. House\nReport Part II, at 18. See also H. R. Rep. No. 102–40,\npt. I, pp. 45–48 (1991) (hereinafter House Report Part I).\n“If Title VII’s ban on discrimination in employment is to\nbe meaningful,” the House Report explained, “victims of\nintentional discrimination must be able to obtain relief,\nand perpetrators of discrimination must be held liable for\ntheir actions.” House Report Part II, at 18.\n   Superseding Price Waterhouse in part, Congress sought\nto “restore” the rule of decision followed by several Cir­\ncuits that any discrimination “actually shown to play a\nrole in a contested employment decision may be the sub­\nject of liability.” House Report Part II, at 18. See also\nHouse Report Part I, at 48. To that end, Congress enacted\n§2000e–2(m) and §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). The latter provides\nthat an employer’s proof that an adverse employment\naction would have been taken in any event does not shield\nthe employer from liability; such proof, however, limits the\nplaintiff ’s remedies to declaratory or injunctive relief,\nattorney’s fees, and costs.\n   Critically, the rule Congress intended to “restore” was\nnot limited to substantive discrimination. As the House\nReport explained, “the Committee endors[ed] . . . the\ndecisional law” in Bibbs v. Block, 778 F. 2d 1318 (CA8\n1985) (en banc), which held that a violation of Title VII\nis established when the trier of fact determines that “an\nunlawful motive played some part in the employment\ndecision or decisional process.” Id., at 1323; see House\nReport Part I, at 48.

NASSAR\n\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\nBibbs had been applied to retaliation claims. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. Legal Servs. of Arkansas, Inc., 813 F. 2d 893,\n900 (CA8 1987) (“Should the court find that retaliation\nplayed some invidious part in the [plaintiff ’s] termination,\na violation of Title VII will be established under Bibbs.”).\nSee also EEOC v. General Lines, Inc., 865 F. 2d 1555, 1560\n(CA10 1989).\n                             B\n   There is scant reason to think that, despite Congress’\naim to “restore and strengthen . . . laws that ban discrimi­\nnation in employment,” House Report Part II, at 2, Con­\ngress meant to exclude retaliation claims from the newly\nenacted “motivating factor” provision. Section 2000e–2(m)\nprovides that an “unlawful employment practice is estab­\nlished” when the plaintiff shows that a protected charac­\nteristic was a factor driving “any employment practice.”\nTitle VII, in §2000e–3(a), explicitly denominates retalia­\ntion, like status-based discrimination, an “unlawful em­\nployment practice.”     Because “any employment prac-\ntice” necessarily encompasses practices prohibited\nunder §2000e–3(a), §2000e–2(m), by its plain terms, covers\nretaliation.\n   Notably, when it enacted §2000e–2(m), Congress did\nnot tie the new provision specifically to §§2000e–2(a)–(d),\nwhich proscribe discrimination “because of ” race, color,\nreligion, gender, or national origin. Rather, Congress\nadded an entirely new provision to codify the causation\nstandard, one encompassing “any employment practice.”\n§2000e–2(m).\n   Also telling, §2000e–2(m) is not limited to situations in\nwhich the complainant’s race, color, religion, sex, or na­\ntional origin motivates the employer’s action. In contrast,\nTitle VII’s substantive antidiscrimination provisions refer\nto the protected characteristics of the complaining party.\nSee §§2000e–2(a)(1)–(2), (c)(2) (referring to “such individu­\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

It chose, instead, to bring within §2000e–\n2(m) “any employment practice.” To cut out retaliation\nfrom §2000e–2(m)’s scope, one must be blind to that\nchoice. Cf. Jackson, 544 U. S., at 179, n. 3 (omission of\nreference to the complaining party’s sex in Title IX sup­\nports the conclusion that the statute protects a male plain­\ntiff from retaliation in response to complaints about sex\ndiscrimination against women).\n                              C\n  From the inception of §2000e–2(m), the agency entrusted\nwith interpretation of Title VII and superintendence of\nthe Act’s administration, the EEOC, see §2000e–5, has\nunderstood the provision to cover retaliation claims.\nShortly after Congress amended Title VII to include the\nmotivating-factor provision, the EEOC issued guidance\nadvising that, “[a]lthough [§2000e–2(m)] does not specify\nretaliation as a basis for finding liability whenever it is a\nmotivating factor for an action, neither does it suggest\nany basis for deviating from the Commission’s long­\nstanding rule that it will find liability . . . whenever\nretaliation plays any role in an employment decision.”\nEEOC, Revised Enforcement Guidance on Recent Devel­\nopments in Disparate Treatment Theory, p. 20, n. 14 (July\n14, 1992) (hereinafter EEOC Guidance), available at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/disparat.html (as visited\nJune 21, 2013, and in Clerk of Court’s case file). As the\nEEOC’s initial guidance explained, “if retaliation were to\ngo unremedied, it would have a chilling effect upon the\nwillingness of individuals to speak out against employ­\nment discrimination.” Ibid.\n  In its compliance manual, the EEOC elaborated on its\n12     UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

See Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944); Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 399 (2008) (“[EEOC’s] policy\nstatements, embodied in its compliance manual and inter­\nnal directives . . . reflect a body of experience and informed\njudgment. . . . As such, they are entitled to a measure of\nrespect under the less deferential Skidmore standard.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). If the breadth of\n§2000e–2(m) can be deemed ambiguous (although I believe\nits meaning is plain), the provision should be construed to\naccord with the EEOC’s well-reasoned and longstanding\nguidance.\n                               IV\n  The Court draws the opposite conclusion, ruling that\nretaliation falls outside the scope of §2000e–2(m). In so\nholding, the Court ascribes to Congress the unlikely pur­\npose of separating retaliation claims from discrimination\nclaims, thereby undermining the Legislature’s effort to\nfortify the protections of Title VII. None of the reasons the\nCourt offers in support of its restrictive interpretation of\n§2000e–2(m) survives inspection.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The Court\nacknowledges, however, that “the text of the motivating­\nfactor provision . . . begins by referring to unlawful em­\nployment practices,” a term that undeniably includes\nretaliation. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nNevermind that, the Court continues, for §2000e–2(m)\ngoes on to reference as “motivating factor[s]” only “race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” The Court thus\nsees retaliation as a protected activity entirely discrete\nfrom status-based discrimination. Ibid.\n   This vision of retaliation as a separate concept runs up\nagainst precedent. See supra, at 6–7. Until today, the\nCourt has been clear eyed on just what retaliation is: a\nmanifestation of status-based discrimination. As Jackson\nexplained in the context of sex discrimination, “retalia­\ntion is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because it is\nan intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an\nallegation of sex discrimination.” 544 U. S., at 174.\n   The Court does not take issue with Jackson’s insight.\nInstead, it distinguishes Jackson and like cases on the\nground that they concerned laws in which “Congress’\ntreatment of the subject of prohibited discrimination was\nboth broad and brief.” Ante, at 15. Title VII, by contrast,\n“is a detailed statutory scheme,” that “enumerates specific\nunlawful employment practices,” “defines key terms,” and\n“exempts certain types of employers.” Ante, at 16. Accord­\ningly, the Court says, “it would be improper to indulge\n[the] suggestion that Congress meant to incorporate [in\nTitle VII] the default rules that apply only when Congress\nwrites a broad and undifferentiated statute.” Ibid.\n   It is strange logic indeed to conclude that when Con­\ngress homed in on retaliation and codified the proscrip­\ntion, as it did in Title VII, Congress meant protection\n14        UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

It is hardly surprising, then, that\nour jurisprudence does not support the Court’s conclusion.\nIn Gómez-Pérez, the Court construed the federal-sector\nprovision of the ADEA, which proscribes “discrimination\nbased on age,” 29 U. S. C. §633a(a), to bar retaliation. The\nCourt did so mindful that another part of the Act, the\nprovision applicable to private-sector employees, explicitly\nproscribes retaliation and, moreover, “set[s] out a specific\nlist of forbidden employer practices.” Gómez-Pérez, 553\nU. S., at 486–487 (citing 29 U. S. C. §§623(a) and (d)).\n   The Court suggests that “the la[w] at issue in . . .\nGómez-Pérez [was a] broad, general ba[r] on discrimina­\ntion.” Ante, at 15. But, as our opinion in that case ob­\nserves, some of the ADEA’s provisions are brief, broad,\nand general, while others are extensive, specific, and\ndetailed. 553 U. S., at 487. So too of Title VII. See ibid.\n(“The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned di­\nrectly after Title VII’s federal-sector discrimination ban . . .\n[which] contains a broad prohibition of ‘discrimination,’\nrather than a list of specific prohibited practices.” (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). It makes little sense\nto apply a different mode of analysis to Title VII’s §2000e–\n2(m) and the ADEA’s §633a(a), both brief statements on\ndiscrimination in the context of larger statutory schemes.5\n——————\n  5 The Court obscures the inconsistency between today’s opinion and\nGómez-Pérez by comparing §633a to all of Title VII. See ante, at 16\n(“Unlike Title IX, §1981, §1982, and the federal-sector provisions of the\nADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory scheme.”). That comparison is\ninapt. Like Title VII, the ADEA is a “detailed statutory scheme.” Ibid.\nCompare ibid. (citing Title VII provisions that proscribe status-based\ndiscrimination by employers, employment agencies, labor organiza­\ntions, and training programs; bar retaliation; prohibit advertising a\npreference for certain protected characteristics; define terms; exempt\ncertain employers; and create an agency with rulemaking and enforce­\nment authority), with 29 U.

The same is true\nof the ADA, the Court says, as “Congress provided not\njust a general prohibition on discrimination ‘because of\n[an individual’s] disability,’ but also seven paragraphs of\ndetailed description of the practices that would constitute\nthe prohibited discrimination . . . [a]nd . . . an express\nantiretaliation provision.” Ante, at 17.\n  This argument is underwhelming. Yes, Congress has\nsometimes addressed retaliation explicitly in antidiscrim­\nination statutes. When it does so, there is no occasion for\ninterpretation. But when Congress simply targets dis­\ncrimination “because of ” protected characteristics, or, as\nin §2000e–2(m), refers to employment practices motivated\nby race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, how should\ncourts comprehend those phrases? They should read them\ninformed by this Court’s consistent holdings that such\nphrases draw in retaliation, for, in truth, retaliation is a\n——————\nination by employers, employment agencies, and labor unions; barring\nretaliation; prohibiting advertising a preference for employees of a\nparticular age), §628 (granting rulemaking authority to the EEOC), and\n§630 (defining terms). Thus, §633a is just like §2000e–2(m) in the\nrelevant respect: both are single provisions comprised within a detailed\nscheme.\n  6 Now codified at 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1(b), §109(b) provides:\n\n  “It shall not be unlawful under §2000e–2 or 2000e–3 . . . for an em­\nployer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited by such section, with\nrespect to an employee in a workplace in a foreign country if compliance\nwith such section would cause such employer . . . to violate the law of\nthe foreign country in which such workplace is located.” The provision\nwas framed to accord with this Court’s decision in EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991).\n16     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL \n\n                   CENTER v.

That\nis why the Court can point to no prior instance in which an\nantidiscrimination law was found not to cover retaliation.\nThe Court’s volte-face is particularly imprudent in the\ncontext of §2000e–2(m), a provision added as part of Con­\ngress’ effort to toughen protections against workplace\ndiscrimination.\n                             B\n  The Court also disassociates retaliation from status­\nbased discrimination by stressing that the bar on the\nlatter appears in §2000e–2, while the proscription of retal­\niation appears in a separate provision, §2000e–3. Section\n2000e–2, the Court asserts, “contains Title VII’s ban on\nstatus-based discrimination . . . and says nothing about\nretaliation.” Ante, at 13. Retaliation, the Court therefore\nconcludes, should not be read into §2000e–2(m). Ante, at\n13–14.\n  The Court’s reasoning rests on a false premise. Section\n2000e–2 does not deal exclusively with discrimination\nbased on protected characteristics. The provisions stated\nafter §§2000e–2(a)–(d) deal with a variety of matters,\nsome of them unquestionably covering retaliation. For\nexample, §2000e–2(n), enacted in tandem with and located\nimmediately after §2000e–2(m), limits opportunities to\ncollaterally attack employment practices installed to im­\nplement a consent judgment. Section 2000e–2(n) applies\nbeyond the substantive antidiscrimination provisions in\n§2000e–2; indeed, it applies beyond Title VII to encom­\npass claims “under the Constitution or [other] Federal\ncivil rights laws.” §2000e–2(n)(1)(A). Thus, if an employee\nsues for retaliatory discharge in violation of §2000e–3(a),\nand a consent judgment orders reinstatement, any person\nadversely affected by that judgment (e.g., an employee\nwho loses seniority as a result) would generally be barred\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  17\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom attacking the judgment if she was given actual no-\ntice of the proposed order and a reasonable opportunity to\npresent objections. That Congress placed the consent­\njudgment provision in §2000e–2 and not in §2000e–3 is of\nno moment. As the text of the provision plainly conveys,\n§2000e–2(n) would reach consent judgments settling\ncomplaints about retaliation, just as it would cover con­\nsent judgments settling complaints about status-based\ndiscrimination.\n   Section 2000e–2(g) is similarly illustrative. Under that\nprovision, “it shall not be an unlawful employment prac­\ntice for an employer . . . to discharge [an] individual” if she\nfails to fulfill any requirement imposed in the interest of\nnational security. Because §2000e–3(a) renders retal-\niation an “unlawful employment practice,” §2000e–2(g)’s\nexemption would no doubt apply to a Title VII retaliatory\ndischarge claim. Given these provisions, Congress’ place­\nment of the motivating-factor provision within §2000e–2\ncannot bear the weight the Court places on it.7\n                            C\n  The Court gives no deference to the EEOC’s longstand­\ning position that §2000e–2(m) applies to retaliation be­\ncause, the Court charges, the agency did not “address the\nparticular interplay among the status-based antidiscrimi­\n——————\n  7 The Court’s assertion that we “confronted a similar structural dis­\n\npute in Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981),” ante, at 17, as­\nsumes its own conclusion. As the Court explains, in Nakshian, the\nplaintiff argued that §633a of the ADEA afforded the right to trial by\njury. 453 U. S., at 157. An amendment to the private-sector provision,\ncodified at 29 U. S. C. §626(c), granted that right to plaintiffs suing\nprivate employers, as well as state and local governmental entities.\nBut no one argued in Nakshian that the private-sector amendment\napplied to the federal-sector provision. Hence, Nakshian’s holding that\nthe ADEA does not permit a federal-sector plaintiff to try her case\nbefore a jury is relevant only if the Court is correct that §2000e–2(m)\ndoes not cover retaliation claims.\n18     UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

Not so.\n    In its compliance manual, the EEOC noted that some\ncourts had concluded that §2000e–2(m) does not cover\nretaliation, citing as an example Woodson v. Scott Paper\nCo., 109 F. 3d 913 (CA3 1997). In that decision, the Third\nCircuit acknowledged it was “given pause by the fact that\n. . . courts have generally borrowed from discrimination\nlaw in determining the burdens and order of proof in\nretaliation cases.” Id., at 934. One could therefore say,\nthe Third Circuit continued, that “Congress knew of the\npractice of borrowing in retaliation cases, and presumed\nthat courts would continue this practice after the 1991\nAct.” Ibid.\n    While Woodson rejected that argument, the EEOC\nfound it sound.       See EEOC Compliance Manual, at\n614:0008, n. 45 (“Courts have long held that the eviden­\ntiary framework for proving employment discrimination\nbased on race, sex, or other protected class status also\napplies to claims of discrimination based on retaliation.”).\nSee also EEOC Guidance, at 20, n. 14 (while §2000e–2(m)\ndoes not explicitly refer to retaliation, nothing in the\nprovision calls for deviation from the longstanding practice\nof finding liability when a plaintiff demonstrates that\nretaliatory intent motivated an adverse employment\ndecision). By adverting to Woodson, the EEOC made clear\nthat it considered the very argument the Court relies on\ntoday. Putting down the agency’s appraisal as “generic,”\nante, at 22, is thus conspicuously unfair comment.\n    The Court’s second reason for refusing to accord de-\nference to the EEOC fares no better. The EEOC’s conclu-\nsion that “the lessened causation standard is necessary in\norder to prevent ‘proven retaliation’ from ‘go[ing] unpun­\nished,’ ” the Court reasons, “is circular” because it “as­\nsumes the answer to the central question at issue here,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nwhich is what causal relationship must be shown in order\nto prove retaliation.” Ibid. That reasoning will not wash.\nUnder the motivating-factor test set out in §2000e–2(m), a\nplaintiff prevails if she shows that proscribed conduct “was\na motivating factor” for the adverse employment action\nshe encountered, “even though other factors also moti-\nvated the [action].” She will succeed, although the relief to\nwhich she is entitled may be restricted. See supra, at 9.\nUnder the Court’s view, proof that retaliation was a factor\nmotivating an adverse employment action is insufficient to\nestablish liability under §2000e–3(a). The Court’s but-for\ncausation standard does not mean that the plaintiff has\nfailed to prove she was subjected to unlawful retaliation.\nIt does mean, however, that proof of a retaliatory motive\nalone yields no victory for the plaintiff. Put otherwise, the\nCourt’s view “permits proven retaliation to go unpun­\nished,” just as the EEOC recognized. See EEOC Compli­\nance Manual, at 614:0008, n. 45.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  Having narrowed §2000e–2(m) to exclude retaliation\nclaims, the Court turns to Gross v. FBL Financial Ser­\nvices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167 (2009), to answer the question\npresented: Whether a plaintiff must demonstrate but-for\ncausation to establish liability under §2000e–3(a).\n  The Court held in Gross that, in contrast to Title VII,\n§623(a) of the ADEA does not authorize any age discrimi­\nnation claim asserting mixed motives. Explaining that\nuniform interpretation of the two statutes is sometimes\nunwarranted, the Court noted in Gross that the phrase\n“because of . . . age” in §623(a) has not been read “to bar\ndiscrimination against people of all ages, even though the\nCourt had previously interpreted ‘because of . . . race [or]\nsex’ in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all\nraces and both sexes.” 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2. Yet Gross,\n20       UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL \n\n                     CENTER v.

Instead, statutory lines should be\ncrossed: The meaning of “because” in Title VII’s retaliation\nprovision should be read to mean just what the Court held\n“because” means for ADEA-liability purposes. But see\nGross, 557 U. S., at 174 (“When conducting statutory\ninterpretation, we ‘must be careful not to apply rules\napplicable under one statute to a different statute without\ncareful and critical examination.’ ”(quoting Holowecki, 552\nU. S., at 393)). In other words, the employer prevailed in\nGross because, according to the Court, the ADEA’s anti­\ndiscrimination prescription is not like Title VII’s. But the\nemployer prevails again in Nassar’s case, for there is no\n“meaningful textual difference,” ante, at 11, between the\nADEA’s use of “because” and the use of the same word in\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision. What sense can one make\nof this other than “heads the employer wins, tails the\nemployee loses”?\n   It is a standard principle of statutory interpretation that\nidentical phrases appearing in the same statute—here,\nTitle VII—ordinarily bear a consistent meaning. See\nPowerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.\n224, 232 (2007). Following that principle, Title VII’s\nretaliation provision, like its status-based discrimination\nprovision, would permit mixed-motive claims, and the\nsame causation standard would apply to both provisions.\n                               B\n     The Court’s decision to construe §2000e–3(a) to require\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

Recall that Price\nWaterhouse interpreted “because of ” in §2000e–2(a) to\npermit mixed-motive claims. See supra, at 8. The Court\ntoday rejects the proposition that, if §2000e–2(m) does not\ncover retaliation, such claims are governed by Price Water­\nhouse’s burden-shifting framework, i.e., if the plaintiff\nshows that discrimination was a motivating factor in an\nadverse employment action, the defendant may escape\nliability only by showing it would have taken the same\naction had there been no illegitimate motive. It is wrong\nto revert to Price Waterhouse, the Court says, because the\n1991 Civil Rights Act’s amendments to Title VII abrogated\nthat decision.\n   This conclusion defies logic. Before the 1991 amend­\nments, several courts had applied Price Waterhouse’s\nburden-shifting framework to retaliation claims.8 In the\nCourt’s view, Congress designed §2000e–2(m)’s motivating­\nfactor standard not only to exclude retaliation claims, but\nalso to override, sub silentio, Circuit precedent apply-\ning the Price Waterhouse framework to such claims. And\nwith what did the 1991 Congress replace the Price Water­\nhouse burden-shifting framework? With a but-for causa­\ntion requirement Gross applied to the ADEA 17 years\nafter the 1991 amendments to Title VII. Shut from the\nCourt’s sight is a legislative record replete with state­\nments evincing Congress’ intent to strengthen antidis­\ncrimination laws and thereby hold employers accountable\nfor prohibited discrimination. See Civil Rights Act of\n1991, §2, 105 Stat. 1071; House Report Part II, at 18. It is\nan odd mode of statutory interpretation that divines Con­\ngress’ aim in 1991 by looking to a decision of this Court,\n——————\n  8 See Vislisel v.

Nor is\nthe Court concerned about the capacity of jurors to follow\ninstructions conforming to today’s decision. Causation is a\ncomplicated concept to convey to juries in the best of cir­\ncumstances. Asking jurors to determine liability based on\ndifferent standards in a single case is virtually certain to\nsow confusion. That would be tolerable if the governing\nstatute required double standards, but here, for the rea­\nsons already stated, it does not.\n                             VI \n\n                              A\n\n   The Court’s assertion that the but-for cause require­\nment it adopts necessarily follows from §2000e–3(a)’s use\nof the word “because” fails to convince. Contrary to the\nCourt’s suggestion, see ante, at 5–6, the word “because”\ndoes not inevitably demand but-for causation to the exclu­\nsion of all other causation formulations. When more than\none factor contributes to a plaintiff ’s injury, but-for causa­\ntion is problematic. See, e.g., 1 Restatement (Third) of\nTorts §27, Comment a, p. 385 (2005) (noting near univer­\nsal agreement that the but-for standard is inappropriate\nwhen multiple sufficient causes exist) (hereinafter Re­\nstatement Third); Restatement of Torts §9, Comment b,\np. 18 (1934) (legal cause is a cause that is a “substantial\nfactor in bringing about the harm”).\n   When an event is “overdetermined,” i.e., when two forces\ncreate an injury each alone would be sufficient to cause,\nmodern tort law permits the plaintiff to prevail upon\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

In contrast, under\nthe Court’s approach (which it erroneously calls “textbook\ntort law,” ante, at 6), a Title VII plaintiff alleging retalia­\ntion cannot establish liability if her firing was prompted\nby both legitimate and illegitimate factors. Ante, at\n18–19.\n   Today’s opinion rehashes arguments rightly rejected in\nPrice Waterhouse. Concurring in the judgment in that\ncase, Justice O’Connor recognized the disconnect between\nthe standard the dissent advocated, which would have\nimposed on the plaintiff the burden of showing but-for\ncausation, see 490 U. S., at 282, 286–287 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting), and the common-law doctrines on which the\ndissent relied. As Justice O’Connor explained:\n      “[I]n the area of tort liability, from whence the dis­\n      sent’s ‘but-for’ standard of causation is derived, . . .\n      the law has long recognized that in certain ‘civil cases’\n      leaving the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff to\n      prove ‘but-for’ causation would be both unfair and de­\n      structive of the deterrent purposes embodied in the\n      concept of duty of care. Thus, in multiple causation\n      cases, where a breach of duty has been established,\n      the common law of torts has long shifted the burden of\n      proof to . . . defendants to prove that their negligent\n      actions were not the ‘but-for’ cause of the plaintiff ’s\n      injury.” Id., at 263–264 (concurring in judgment) (cit­\n      ing Summers v.

Noting that, under the\nstandard embraced by the dissent in Price Waterhouse,\nneither of two sufficient forces would constitute cause even\nif either one alone would have led to the injury, the plural­\nity remarked: “We need not leave our common sense at the\ndoorstep when we interpret a statute.” 490 U.

Even if the test is\nappropriate in some tort contexts, “it is an entirely differ­\nent matter to determine a ‘but-for’ relation when . . .\nconsider[ing], not physical forces, but the mind-related\ncharacteristics that constitute motive.” Gross, 557 U. S., at\n190 (BREYER, J., dissenting). When assessing an employ­\ner’s multiple motives, “to apply ‘but-for’ causation is to\nengage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have\nhappened if the employer’s thoughts and other circum­\nstances had been different.” Id., at 191. See also Price\nWaterhouse, 490 U. S., at 264 (opinion of O’Connor, J.)\n(“ ‘[A]t . . . times the [but-for] test demands the impossible.\nIt challenges the imagination of the trier to probe into a\npurely fanciful and unknowable state of affairs.’ ” (quoting\nMalone, Ruminations on Cause-In-Fact, 9 Stan. L. Rev.\n60, 67 (1956))).\n    This point, lost on the Court, was not lost on Congress.\nWhen Title VII was enacted, Congress considered and\nrejected an amendment that would have placed the word\n“solely” before “because of [the complainant’s] race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin.” See 110 Cong. Rec. 2728,\n13837–13838 (1964). Senator Case, a prime sponsor of\nTitle VII, commented that a “sole cause” standard would\nrender the Act “totally nugatory.” Id., at 13837. Life does\nnot shape up that way, the Senator suggested, comment­\ning “[i]f anyone ever had an action that was motivated by\na single cause, he is a different kind of animal from any\nI know of.” Ibid.\n                        *    *     *\n  The Court holds, at odds with a solid line of decisions\nrecognizing that retaliation is inextricably bound up with\nstatus-based discrimination, that §2000e–2(m) excludes\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

It then reaches outside of Title VII to\narrive at an interpretation of “because” that lacks sensitiv­\nity to the realities of life at work. In this endeavor, the\nCourt is guided neither by precedent, nor by the aims\nof legislators who formulated and amended Title VII. In-\ndeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the\nnumber of retaliation claims filed against employers. See\nante, at 18–19. Congress had no such goal in mind when\nit added §2000e–2(m) to Title VII. See House Report Part\nII, at 2. Today’s misguided judgment, along with the\njudgment in Vance v.

Argued April 24, 2013—Decided June 24, 2013\nPetitioner, a university medical center (University) that is part of the\n  University of Texas system, specializes in medical education. It has\n  an affiliation agreement with Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospi-\n  tal), which requires the Hospital to offer vacant staff physician posts\n  to University faculty members. Respondent, a physician of Middle\n  Eastern descent who was both a University faculty member and a\n  Hospital staff physician, claimed that Dr. Levine, one of his supervi-\n  sors at the University, was biased against him on account of his reli-\n  gion and ethnic heritage. He complained to Dr. Fitz, Levine’s super-\n  visor. But after he arranged to continue working at the Hospital\n  without also being on the University’s faculty, he resigned his teach-\n  ing post and sent a letter to Fitz and others, stating that he was leav-\n  ing because of Levine’s harassment. Fitz, upset at Levine’s public\n  humiliation and wanting public exoneration for her, objected to the\n  Hospital’s job offer, which was then withdrawn. Respondent filed\n  suit, alleging two discrete Title VII violations. First, he alleged that\n  Levine’s racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted\n  in his constructive discharge from the University, in violation of 42\n  U. S. C. §2000e–2(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminat-\n  ing against an employee “because of such individual’s race, color, re-\n  ligion, sex, and national origin” (referred to here as status-based dis-\n  crimination). Second, he claimed that Fitz’s efforts to prevent the\n  Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about\n  Levine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a), which prohibits\n  employer retaliation “because [an employee] has opposed . . . an un-\n  lawful employment practice . . . or . . . made a [Title VII] charge.”\n  The jury found for respondent on both claims.

And it\n    found that the evidence supported a finding that Fitz was motivated,\n    at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for his complaints\n    about Levine.\nHeld: Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to tradi-\n tional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test\n stated in §2000e–2(m). Pp. 5–23.\n     (a) In defining the proper causation standard for Title VII retalia-\n tion claims, it is presumed that Congress incorporated tort law’s cau-\n sation in fact standard—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in\n fact cause the plaintiff’s injury—absent an indication to the contrary\n in the statute itself. See Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285. An em-\n ployee alleging status-based discrimination under §2000e–2 need not\n show “but-for” causation. It suffices instead to show that the motive\n to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives, even if the em-\n ployer also had other, lawful motives for the decision. This principle\n is the result of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, and the\n ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which substituted a new\n burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.\n As relevant here, that Act added a new subsection to §2000e–2,\n providing that “an unlawful employment practice is established when\n the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or\n national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,\n even though other factors also motivated the practice,” §2000e–2(m).\n     Also relevant here is this Court’s decision in Gross v. FBL Finan­\n cial Services, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176, which interprets the Age Dis-\n crimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) phrase “because of\n . . . age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Gross holds two insights that inform\n the analysis of this case. The first is textual and concerns the proper\n interpretation of the term “because” as it relates to the principles of\n causation underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second is\n the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both Title VII itself\n and the 1991 Act. Pp. 5–11.\n     (b) Title VII’s antiretaliation provision appears in a different sec-\n tion from its status-based discrimination ban. And, like §623(a)(1),\n the ADEA provision in Gross, §2000e–3(a) makes it unlawful for an\n employer to take adverse employment action against an employee\n “because” of certain criteria. Given the lack of any meaningful textu-\n al difference between §2000e–3(a) and §623(a)(1), the proper conclu-\n sion is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nto retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment ac-\ntion. Respondent and the United States maintain that §2000e–2(m)’s\nmotivating-factor test applies, but that reading is flawed. First, it is\ninconsistent with the provision’s plain language, which addresses on-\nly race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination and\nsays nothing about retaliation. Second, their reading is inconsistent\nwith the statute’s design and structure. Congress inserted the moti-\nvating-factor provision as a subsection within §2000e–2, which deals\nonly with status-based discrimination. The conclusion that Congress\nacted deliberately in omitting retaliation claims from §2000–2(m) is\nreinforced by the fact that another part of the 1991 Act, §109, ex-\npressly refers to all unlawful employment actions. See EEOC v. Ara­\nbian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 256. Third, the cases they rely\non, which state the general proposition that Congress’ enactment of a\nbroadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant\nintent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrim-\nination, see, e.g., CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442,\n452–453; Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474, do not support the\nquite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or\nnationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a syn-\nonym for “retaliation,” especially in a precise, complex, and exhaus-\ntive statute like Title VII. The Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990, which contains seven paragraphs of detailed description of the\npractices constituting prohibited discrimination, as well as an ex-\npress antiretaliation provision, and which was passed only a year be-\nfore §2000e–2(m)’s enactment, shows that when Congress elected to\naddress retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so\nclearly. Pp. 11–17.\n   (c) The proper interpretation and implementation of §2000e–3(a)\nand its causation standard are of central importance to the fair and\nresponsible allocation of resources in the judicial and litigation sys-\ntems, particularly since retaliation claims are being made with ever-\nincreasing frequency. Lessening the causation standard could also\ncontribute to the filing of frivolous claims, siphoning resources from\nefforts by employers, agencies, and courts to combat workplace har-\nassment. Pp. 18–20.\n   (d) Respondent and the Government argue that their view would\nbe consistent with longstanding agency views contained in an Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission guidance manual, but the\nmanual’s explanations for its views lack the persuasive force that is a\nnecessary precondition to deference under Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,\n323 U. S. 134, 140. Respondent’s final argument—that if §2000e–\n2(m) does not control, then the Price Waterhouse standard should—is\nforeclosed by the 1991 Act’s amendments to Title VII, which dis-\n4        UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

NAIEL NASSAR\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 24, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   When the law grants persons the right to compensation\nfor injury from wrongful conduct, there must be some\ndemonstrated connection, some link, between the injury\nsustained and the wrong alleged. The requisite relation\nbetween prohibited conduct and compensable injury is\ngoverned by the principles of causation, a subject most\noften arising in elaborating the law of torts. This case\nrequires the Court to define those rules in the context of\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e\net seq., which provides remedies to employees for injuries\nrelated to discriminatory conduct and associated wrongs\nby employers.\n   Title VII is central to the federal policy of prohibiting\nwrongful discrimination in the Nation’s workplaces and in\nall sectors of economic endeavor. This opinion discusses\nthe causation rules for two categories of wrongful employer\nconduct prohibited by Title VII. The first type is called,\nfor purposes of this opinion, status-based discrimination.\nThe term is used here to refer to basic workplace protec-\ntion such as prohibitions against employer discrimination\n2       UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                    CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\nin hiring, firing, salary structure, promotion and the like.\nSee §2000e–2(a). The second type of conduct is employer\nretaliation on account of an employee’s having opposed,\ncomplained of, or sought remedies for, unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination. See §2000e–3(a).\n   An employee who alleges status-based discrimination\nunder Title VII need not show that the causal link be-\ntween injury and wrong is so close that the injury would\nnot have occurred but for the act. So-called but-for causa-\ntion is not the test. It suffices instead to show that the\nmotive to discriminate was one of the employer’s motives,\neven if the employer also had other, lawful motives that\nwere causative in the employer’s decision. This principle\nis the result of an earlier case from this Court, Price Water­\nhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), and an ensuing\nstatutory amendment by Congress that codified in part\nand abrogated in part the holding in Price Waterhouse, see\n§§2000e–2(m), 2000e–5(g)(2)(B). The question the Court\nmust answer here is whether that lessened causation\nstandard is applicable to claims of unlawful employer\nretaliation under §2000e–3(a).\n   Although the Court has not addressed the question of\nthe causation showing required to establish liability for a\nTitle VII retaliation claim, it has addressed the issue of\ncausation in general in a case involving employer discrim-\nination under a separate but related statute, the Age\nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29\nU. S. C. §623. See Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.,\n557 U. S. 167 (2009). In Gross, the Court concluded that\nthe ADEA requires proof that the prohibited criterion was\nthe but-for cause of the prohibited conduct.

The agreement also requires the Hospital to\noffer empty staff physician posts to the University’s faculty\nmembers, see App. 361–362, 366, and, accordingly, most of\nthe staff physician positions at the Hospital are filled by\nthose faculty members.\n   Respondent is a medical doctor of Middle Eastern de-\nscent who specializes in internal medicine and infectious\ndiseases. In 1995, he was hired to work both as a member\nof the University’s faculty and a staff physician at the\nHospital. He left both positions in 1998 for additional\nmedical education and then returned in 2001 as an assis-\ntant professor at the University and, once again, as a\nphysician at the Hospital.\n   In 2004, Dr. Beth Levine was hired as the University’s\nChief of Infectious Disease Medicine. In that position\nLevine became respondent’s ultimate (though not direct)\nsuperior. Respondent alleged that Levine was biased\nagainst him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage,\na bias manifested by undeserved scrutiny of his billing\npractices and productivity, as well as comments that\n“ ‘Middle Easterners are lazy.’ ” 674 F. 3d 448, 450 (CA5\n2012). On different occasions during his employment,\nrespondent met with Dr. Gregory Fitz, the University’s\nChair of Internal Medicine and Levine’s supervisor, to\ncomplain about Levine’s alleged harassment. Despite\nobtaining a promotion with Levine’s assistance in 2006,\nrespondent continued to believe that she was biased\n4      UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nagainst him. So he tried to arrange to continue working\nat the Hospital without also being on the University’s\nfaculty. After preliminary negotiations with the Hospital\nsuggested this might be possible, respondent resigned his\nteaching post in July 2006 and sent a letter to Dr. Fitz\n(among others), in which he stated that the reason for his\ndeparture was harassment by Levine. That harassment,\nhe asserted, “ ‘stems from . . . religious, racial and cultural\nbias against Arabs and Muslims.’ ” Id., at 451. After\nreading that letter, Dr. Fitz expressed consternation at\nrespondent’s accusations, saying that Levine had been\n“publicly humiliated by th[e] letter” and that it was “very\nimportant that she be publicly exonerated.” App. 41.\n   Meanwhile, the Hospital had offered respondent a job as\na staff physician, as it had indicated it would. On learning\nof that offer, Dr. Fitz protested to the Hospital, asserting\nthat the offer was inconsistent with the affiliation agree-\nment’s requirement that all staff physicians also be members\nof the University faculty. The Hospital then withdrew\nits offer.\n   After exhausting his administrative remedies, respond-\nent filed this Title VII suit in the United States District\nCourt for the Northern District of Texas. He alleged two\ndiscrete violations of Title VII. The first was a status-\nbased discrimination claim under §2000e–2(a). Respondent\nalleged that Dr. Levine’s racially and religiously moti-\nvated harassment had resulted in his constructive dis-\ncharge from the University. Respondent’s second claim\nwas that Dr. Fitz’s efforts to prevent the Hospital from\nhiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Dr.\nLevine’s harassment, in violation of §2000e–3(a). 674\nF. 3d, at 452. The jury found for respondent on both\nclaims. It awarded him over $400,000 in backpay and\nmore than $3 million in compensatory damages. The\nDistrict Court later reduced the compensatory damages\naward to $300,000.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naffirmed in part and vacated in part. The court first con-\ncluded that respondent had submitted insufficient evi-\ndence in support of his constructive-discharge claim, so it\nvacated that portion of the jury’s verdict. The court af-\nfirmed as to the retaliation finding, however, on the theory\nthat retaliation claims brought under §2000e–3(a)—like\nclaims of status-based discrimination under §2000e–2(a)—\nrequire only a showing that retaliation was a motivating\nfactor for the adverse employment action, rather than its\nbut-for cause. See id., at 454, n. 16 (citing Smith v. Xerox\nCorp., 602 F. 3d 320, 330 (CA5 2010)). It further held that\nthe evidence supported a finding that Dr. Fitz was moti-\nvated, at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for\nhis complaints against Levine. The Court of Appeals then\nremanded for a redetermination of damages in light of its\ndecision to vacate the constructive-discharge verdict.\n   Four judges dissented from the court’s decision not to\nrehear the case en banc, arguing that the Circuit’s appli-\ncation of the motivating-factor standard to retaliation\ncases was “an erroneous interpretation of [Title VII] and\ncontrolling caselaw” and should be overruled en banc. 688\nF. 3d 211, 213–214 (CA5 2012) (Smith, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).\n   Certiorari was granted. 568 U.

Causation\nin fact—i.e., proof that the defendant’s conduct did in fact\ncause the plaintiff ’s injury—is a standard requirement of\nany tort claim, see Restatement of Torts §9 (1934) (defini-\ntion of “legal cause”); §431, Comment a (same); §279, and\nComment c (intentional infliction of physical harm); §280\n(other intentional torts); §281(c) (negligence).

Manhart, 435 U. S. 702, 711 (1978) (explaining\nthat the “simple test” for determining a discriminatory\nemployment practice is “whether the evidence shows\ntreatment of a person in a manner which but for that\nperson’s sex would be different” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n   In the usual course, this standard requires the plaintiff\nto show “that the harm would not have occurred” in the\nabsence of—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.\nRestatement of Torts §431, Comment a (negligence);\n§432(1), and Comment a (same); see §279, and Comment c\n(intentional infliction of bodily harm); §280 (other inten-\ntional torts); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for\nPhysical and Emotional Harm §27, and Comment b (2010)\n(noting the existence of an exception for cases where an\ninjured party can prove the existence of multiple, inde-\npendently sufficient factual causes, but observing that\n“cases invoking the concept are rare”). See also Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts §432(1) (1963 and 1964) (negli-\ngence claims); §870, Comment l (intentional injury to\nanother); cf. §435a, and Comment a (legal cause for inten-\ntional harm). It is thus textbook tort law that an action “is\nnot regarded as a cause of an event if the particular event\nwould have occurred without it.” W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.\nKeeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts\n265 (5th ed. 1984). This, then, is the background against\nwhich Congress legislated in enacting Title VII, and these\nare the default rules it is presumed to have incorporated,\nabsent an indication to the contrary in the statute itself.\nSee Meyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 285 (2003); Carey v.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nPiphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257–258 (1978).\n                              B\n   Since the statute’s passage in 1964, it has prohibited\nemployers from discriminating against their employees on\nany of seven specified criteria. Five of them—race, color,\nreligion, sex, and national origin—are personal character-\nistics and are set forth in §2000e–2. (As noted at the\noutset, discrimination based on these five characteristics\nis called status-based discrimination in this opinion.) And\nthen there is a point of great import for this case: The two\nremaining categories of wrongful employer conduct—the\nemployee’s opposition to employment discrimination, and\nthe employee’s submission of or support for a complaint\nthat alleges employment discrimination—are not wrongs\nbased on personal traits but rather types of protected\nemployee conduct. These latter two categories are covered\nby a separate, subsequent section of Title VII, §2000e–\n3(a).\n   Under the status-based discrimination provision, it is an\n“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to dis-\ncriminate against any individual . . . because of such\nindividual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”\n§2000e–2(a). In its 1989 decision in Price Waterhouse, the\nCourt sought to explain the causation standard imposed\nby this language. It addressed in particular what it means\nfor an action to be taken “because of ” an individual’s race,\nreligion, or nationality. Although no opinion in that case\ncommanded a majority, six Justices did agree that a plain-\ntiff could prevail on a claim of status-based discrimination\nif he or she could show that one of the prohibited traits\nwas a “motivating” or “substantial” factor in the employ-\ner’s decision. 490 U. S., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at\n259 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 276\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). If the plaintiff\nmade that showing, the burden of persuasion would shift\n8      UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nto the employer, which could escape liability if it could\nprove that it would have taken the same employment\naction in the absence of all discriminatory animus. Id., at\n258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259–260 (opinion of White,\nJ.); id., at 276–277 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). In other\nwords, the employer had to show that a discriminatory\nmotive was not the but-for cause of the adverse employ-\nment action.\n   Two years later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of\n1991 (1991 Act), 105 Stat. 1071. This statute (which had\nmany other provisions) codified the burden-shifting and\nlessened-causation framework of Price Waterhouse in part\nbut also rejected it to a substantial degree. The legislation\nfirst added a new subsection to the end of §2000e–2, i.e.,\nTitle VII’s principal ban on status-based discrimination.\nSee §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075. The new provision, §2000e–\n2(m), states:\n    “[A]n unlawful employment practice is established\n    when the complaining party demonstrates that race,\n    color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating\n    factor for any employment practice, even though other\n    factors also motivated the practice.”\nThis, of course, is a lessened causation standard.\n  The 1991 Act also abrogated a portion of Price Water­\nhouse’s framework by removing the employer’s ability to\ndefeat liability once a plaintiff proved the existence of an\nimpermissible motivating factor. See Gross, 557 U. S., at\n178, n. 5. In its place, Congress enacted §2000e–5(g)(2),\nwhich provides:\n      “(B) On a claim in which an individual proves a vio-\n    lation under section 2000e–2(m) of this title and [the\n    employer] demonstrates that [it] would have taken\n    the same action in the absence of the impermissible\n    motivating factor, the court—\n      “(i) may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief . . .\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    and [limited] attorney’s fees and costs . . . ; and\n       “(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order\n    requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promo-\n    tion, or payment . . . .”\n   So, in short, the 1991 Act substituted a new burden-\nshifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Water­\nhouse. Under that new regime, a plaintiff could obtain\ndeclaratory relief, attorney’s fees and costs, and some\nforms of injunctive relief based solely on proof that race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or nationality was a motivating factor\nin the employment action; but the employer’s proof that it\nwould still have taken the same employment action would\nsave it from monetary damages and a reinstatement\norder. See Gross, 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5; see also id., at\n175, n. 2, 177, n. 3.\n   After Price Waterhouse and the 1991 Act, considerable\ntime elapsed before the Court returned again to the mean-\ning of “because” and the problem of causation. This time it\narose in the context of a different, yet similar statute, the\nADEA, 29 U. S. C. §623(a). See Gross, supra. Much like\nthe Title VII statute in Price Waterhouse, the relevant\nportion of the ADEA provided that “ ‘[i]t shall be unlawful\nfor an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi-\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi-\nvidual’s age.’ ” 557 U. S., at 176 (quoting §623(a)(1);\nemphasis and ellipsis in original).\n   Concentrating first and foremost on the meaning of the\nphrase “ ‘because of . . . age,’ ” the Court in Gross explained\nthat the ordinary meaning of “ ‘because of ’ ” is “ ‘by reason\nof ’ ” or “ ‘on account of.’ ” Id., at 176 (citing 1 Webster’s\nThird New International Dictionary 194 (1966); 1 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 746 (1933); The Random House Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 132 (1966); emphasis in\n10     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\noriginal). Thus, the “requirement that an employer took\nadverse action ‘because of ’ age [meant] that age was the\n‘reason’ that the employer decided to act,” or, in other\nwords, that “age was the ‘but-for’ cause of the employer’s\nadverse decision.” 557 U. S., at 176. See also Safeco Ins.\nCo. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63–64, and n. 14\n(2007) (noting that “because of ” means “based on” and\nthat “ ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship”);\nHolmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503\nU. S. 258, 265–266 (1992) (equating “by reason of ” with\n“ ‘but for’ cause”).\n    In the course of approving this construction, Gross\ndeclined to adopt the interpretation endorsed by the plu-\nrality and concurring opinions in Price Waterhouse. Not-\ning that “the ADEA must be ‘read . . . the way Congress\nwrote it,’ ” 557 U. S., at 179 (quoting Meacham v. Knolls\nAtomic Power Laboratory, 554 U. S. 84, 102 (2008)), the\nCourt concluded that “the textual differences between\nTitle VII and the ADEA” “prevent[ed] us from applying\nPrice Waterhouse . . . to federal age discrimination claims,”\n557 U. S., at 175, n. 2. In particular, the Court stressed\nthe congressional choice not to add a provision like\n§2000e–2(m) to the ADEA despite making numerous other\nchanges to the latter statute in the 1991 Act. Id., at 174–\n175 (citing EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.\n244, 256 (1991)); 557 U. S., at 177, n. 3 (citing 14 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 270 (2009)).\n    Finally, the Court in Gross held that it would not be\nproper to read Price Waterhouse as announcing a rule that\napplied to both statutes, despite their similar wording and\nnear-contemporaneous enactment. 557 U. S., at 178, n. 5.\nThis different reading was necessary, the Court concluded,\nbecause Congress’ 1991 amendments to Title VII, includ-\ning its “careful tailoring of the ‘motivating factor’ claim”\nand the substitution of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B) for Price Water­\nhouse’s full affirmative defense, indicated that the moti-\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nvating-factor standard was not an organic part of Title VII\nand thus could not be read into the ADEA. See 557 U. S.,\nat 178, n. 5.\n   In Gross, the Court was careful to restrict its analysis to\nthe statute before it and withhold judgment on the proper\nresolution of a case, such as this, which arose under Title\nVII rather than the ADEA. But the particular confines of\nGross do not deprive it of all persuasive force. Indeed,\nthat opinion holds two insights for the present case. The\nfirst is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of\nthe term “because” as it relates to the principles of causa-\ntion underlying both §623(a) and §2000e–3(a). The second\nis the significance of Congress’ structural choices in both\nTitle VII itself and the law’s 1991 amendments. These\nprinciples do not decide the present case but do inform its\nanalysis, for the issues possess significant parallels.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  As noted, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision, which is\nset forth in §2000e–3(a), appears in a different section\nfrom Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination. The\nantiretaliation provision states, in relevant part:\n        “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer to discriminate against any of his employees\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an\n    unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or\n    because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.”\n  This enactment, like the statute at issue in Gross,\nmakes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse em-\nployment action against an employee “because” of certain\ncriteria. Cf. 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1). Given the lack of any\nmeaningful textual difference between the text in this\n12     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nstatute and the one in Gross, the proper conclusion here,\nas in Gross, is that Title VII retaliation claims require\nproof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of\nthe challenged employment action. See Gross, supra, at\n176.\n   The principal counterargument offered by respondent\nand the United States relies on their different understand-\ning of the motivating-factor section, which—on its face—\napplies only to status discrimination, discrimination on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\nIn substance, they contend that: (1) retaliation is defined\nby the statute to be an unlawful employment practice; (2)\n§2000e–2(m) allows unlawful employment practices to be\nproved based on a showing that race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin was a motivating factor for—and not nec-\nessarily the but-for factor in—the challenged employment\naction; and (3) the Court has, as a matter of course, held\nthat “retaliation for complaining about race discrimination\nis ‘discrimination based on race.’ ” Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 14; see id., at 11–14; Brief for Respond-\nent 16–19.\n   There are three main flaws in this reading of §2000e–\n2(m). The first is that it is inconsistent with the provi-\nsion’s plain language. It must be acknowledged that\nbecause Title VII defines “unlawful employment practice”\nto include retaliation, the question presented by this case\nwould be different if §2000e–2(m) extended its coverage to\nall unlawful employment practices. As actually written,\nhowever, the text of the motivating-factor provision, while\nit begins by referring to “unlawful employment practices,”\nthen proceeds to address only five of the seven prohibited\ndiscriminatory actions—actions based on the employee’s\nstatus, i.e., race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.\nThis indicates Congress’ intent to confine that provision’s\ncoverage to only those types of employment practices. The\ntext of §2000e–2(m) says nothing about retaliation claims.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nGiven this clear language, it would be improper to con-\nclude that what Congress omitted from the statute is\nnevertheless within its scope. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet.\n58, 93 (1829) (“What the legislative intention was, can be\nderived only from the words they have used; and we can-\nnot speculate beyond the reasonable import of these\nwords”); see Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)\n(slip op., at 8).\n   The second problem with this reading is its inconsistency\nwith the design and structure of the statute as a whole.\nSee Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2, 178, n. 5. Just as Con-\ngress’ choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too\nare its structural choices. See id., at 177, n. 3. When\nCongress wrote the motivating-factor provision in 1991, it\nchose to insert it as a subsection within §2000e–2, which\ncontains Title VII’s ban on status-based discrimination,\n§§2000e–2(a) to (d), (l), and says nothing about retaliation.\nSee 1991 Act, §107(a), 105 Stat. 1075 (directing that\n“§2000e–2 . . . [be] further amended by adding at the end\nthe following new subsection . . . (m)”). The title of the\nsection of the 1991 Act that created §2000e–2(m)—\n“Clarifying prohibition against impermissible considera-\ntion of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in\nemployment practices”—also indicates that Congress\ndetermined to address only claims of status-based\ndiscrimination, not retaliation. See §107(a), id., at 1075.\n   What is more, a different portion of the 1991 Act con-\ntains an express reference to all unlawful employment\nactions, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that Congress\nacted deliberately when it omitted retaliation claims from\n§2000e–2(m). See Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S., at\n256 (congressional amendment of ADEA on a similar\nsubject coupled with congressional failure to amend Title\nVII weighs against conclusion that the ADEA’s standard\napplies to Title VII); see also Gross, supra, at 177, n. 3.\nThe relevant portion of the 1991 Act, §109(b), allowed\n14     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncertain overseas operations by U. S. employers to engage\nin “any practice prohibited by section 703 or 704,” i.e.,\n§2000e–2 or §2000e–3, “if compliance with such section\nwould cause such employer . . . to violate the law of the\nforeign country in which such workplace is located.” 105\nStat. 1077.\n    If Congress had desired to make the motivating-factor\nstandard applicable to all Title VII claims, it could have\nused language similar to that which it invoked in §109.\nSee Arabian American Oil Co., supra, at 256. Or, it could\nhave inserted the motivating-factor provision as part of a\nsection that applies to all such claims, such as §2000e–5,\nwhich establishes the rules and remedies for all Title VII\nenforcement actions. See FDA v. Brown & Williamson\nTobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 160 (2000). But in writing\n§2000e–2(m), Congress did neither of those things, and\n“[w]e must give effect to Congress’ choice.” Gross, supra,\nat 177, n. 3.\n    The third problem with respondent’s and the Govern-\nment’s reading of the motivating-factor standard is in its\nsubmission that this Court’s decisions interpreting federal\nantidiscrimination law have, as a general matter, treated\nbans on status-based discrimination as also prohibiting\nretaliation. In support of this proposition, both respond-\nent and the United States rely upon decisions in which\nthis Court has “read [a] broadly worded civil rights statute\n. . . as including an antiretaliation remedy.” CBOCS West,\nInc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442, 452–453 (2008). In\nCBOCS, for example, the Court held that 42 U. S. C.\n§1981—which declares that all persons “shall have the\nsame right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is\nenjoyed by white citizens”—prohibits not only racial dis-\ncrimination but also retaliation against those who oppose\nit. 553 U.

S. 229, 235, n. 3, 237 (1969) (42 U. S. C.\n§1982).\n   These decisions are not controlling here. It is true these\ncases do state the general proposition that Congress’\nenactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute\nmay signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against\nindividuals who oppose that discrimination, even where\nthe statute does not refer to retaliation in so many words.\nWhat those cases do not support, however, is the quite\ndifferent rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex,\nor nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be\ntreated as a synonym for “retaliation.” For one thing,\n§2000e–2(m) is not itself a substantive bar on discrimina-\ntion. Rather, it is a rule that establishes the causation\nstandard for proving a violation defined elsewhere in Title\nVII. The cases cited by respondent and the Government\ndo not address rules of this sort, and those precedents are\nof limited relevance here.\n   The approach respondent and the Government suggest\nis inappropriate in the context of a statute as precise,\ncomplex, and exhaustive as Title VII. As noted, the laws\nat issue in CBOCS, Jackson, and Gómez-Pérez were broad,\ngeneral bars on discrimination. In interpreting them the\nCourt concluded that by using capacious language Con-\ngress expressed the intent to bar retaliation in addition to\nstatus-based discrimination. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at\n486–488. In other words, when Congress’ treatment of the\nsubject of prohibited discrimination was both broad and\nbrief, its omission of any specific discussion of retaliation\nwas unremarkable.\n16     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n   If Title VII had likewise been phrased in broad and\ngeneral terms, respondent’s argument might have more\nforce. But that is not how Title VII was written, which\nmakes it incorrect to infer that Congress meant anything\nother than what the text does say on the subject of retalia-\ntion. Unlike Title IX, §1981, §1982, and the federal-sector\nprovisions of the ADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory\nscheme. This statute enumerates specific unlawful em-\nployment practices. See §§2000e–2(a)(1), (b), (c)(1), (d)\n(status-based discrimination by employers, employment\nagencies, labor organizations, and training programs,\nrespectively); §2000e–2(l) (status-based discrimination in\nemployment-related testing); §2000e–3(a) (retaliation for\nopposing, or making or supporting a complaint about,\nunlawful employment actions); §2000e–3(b) (advertising a\npreference for applicants of a particular race, color, reli-\ngion, sex, or national origin). It defines key terms, see\n§2000e, and exempts certain types of employers, see\n§2000e–1. And it creates an administrative agency with\nboth rulemaking and enforcement authority.              See\n§§2000e–5, 2000e–12.\n   This fundamental difference in statutory structure\nrenders inapposite decisions which treated retaliation as\nan implicit corollary of status-based discrimination. Text\nmay not be divorced from context. In light of Congress’\nspecial care in drawing so precise a statutory scheme, it\nwould be improper to indulge respondent’s suggestion that\nCongress meant to incorporate the default rules that apply\nonly when Congress writes a broad and undifferentiated\nstatute. See Gómez-Pérez, supra, at 486–488 (when con-\nstruing the broadly worded federal-sector provision of the\nADEA, Court refused to draw inferences from Congress’\namendments to the detailed private-sector provisions);\nArabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S., at 256; cf. Jackson,\nsupra, at 175 (distinguishing Title IX’s “broadly written\ngeneral prohibition on discrimination” from Title VII’s\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n“greater detail [with respect to] the conduct that consti-\ntutes discrimination”).\n   Further confirmation of the inapplicability of §2000e–\n2(m) to retaliation claims may be found in Congress’\napproach to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n(ADA), 104 Stat. 327. In the ADA Congress provided not\njust a general prohibition on discrimination “because of\n[an individual’s] disability,” but also seven paragraphs of\ndetailed description of the practices that would constitute\nthe prohibited discrimination, see §§102(a), (b)(1)–(7), id.,\nat 331–332 (codified at 42 U. S. C. §12112). And, most\npertinent for present purposes, it included an express\nantiretaliation provision, see §503(a), 104 Stat. 370 (codi-\nfied at 42 U. S. C. §12203). That law, which Congress\npassed only a year before enacting §2000e–2(m) and which\nspeaks in clear and direct terms to the question of retalia-\ntion, rebuts the claim that Congress must have intended\nto use the phrase “race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin” as the textual equivalent of “retaliation.” To the\ncontrary, the ADA shows that when Congress elected to\naddress retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme,\nit did so in clear textual terms.\n   The Court confronted a similar structural dispute in\nLehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981). The question\nthere was whether the federal-employment provisions of\nthe ADEA, 29 U. S. C. §633a, provided a jury-trial right\nfor claims against the Federal Government. Nakshian,\n453 U. S., at 157. In concluding that it did not, the Court\nnoted that the portion of the ADEA that prohibited age\ndiscrimination by private, state, and local employers,\n§626, expressly provided for a jury trial, whereas the\nfederal-sector provisions said nothing about such a right.\nId., at 162–163, 168. So, too, here. Congress has in explic-\nit terms altered the standard of causation for one class of\nclaims but not another, despite the obvious opportunity to\ndo so in the 1991 Act.\n18     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                               B\n   The proper interpretation and implementation of\n§2000e–3(a) and its causation standard have central im-\nportance to the fair and responsible allocation of resources\nin the judicial and litigation systems. This is of particular\nsignificance because claims of retaliation are being made\nwith ever-increasing frequency. The number of these\nclaims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) has nearly doubled in the past 15\nyears—from just over 16,000 in 1997 to over 31,000\nin 2012. EEOC, Charge Statistics FY 1997 Through\nFY 2012, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/\ncharges.cfm (as visited June 20, 2013, and available in\nClerk of Court’s case file). Indeed, the number of retalia-\ntion claims filed with the EEOC has now outstripped those\nfor every type of status-based discrimination except race.\nSee ibid.\n   In addition lessening the causation standard could also\ncontribute to the filing of frivolous claims, which would\nsiphon resources from efforts by employer, administrative\nagencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.\nConsider in this regard the case of an employee who\nknows that he or she is about to be fired for poor perform-\nance, given a lower pay grade, or even just transferred to\na different assignment or location. To forestall that lawful\naction, he or she might be tempted to make an unfounded\ncharge of racial, sexual, or religious discrimination; then,\nwhen the unrelated employment action comes, the em-\nployee could allege that it is retaliation. If respondent\nwere to prevail in his argument here, that claim could be\nestablished by a lessened causation standard, all in order\nto prevent the undesired change in employment circum-\nstances. Even if the employer could escape judgment after\ntrial, the lessened causation standard would make it far\nmore difficult to dismiss dubious claims at the summary\njudgment stage. Cf. Vance v. Ball State Univ., post, at 9–\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n11. It would be inconsistent with the structure and opera-\ntion of Title VII to so raise the costs, both financial and\nreputational, on an employer whose actions were not in\nfact the result of any discriminatory or retaliatory intent.\nSee Brief for National School Boards Association as Ami­\ncus Curiae 11–22. Yet there would be a significant risk of\nthat consequence if respondent’s position were adopted\nhere.\n   The facts of this case also demonstrate the legal and\nfactual distinctions between status-based and retaliation\nclaims, as well as the importance of the correct standard of\nproof. Respondent raised both claims in the District\nCourt. The alleged wrongdoer differed in each: In re-\nspondent’s status-based discrimination claim, it was his\nindirect supervisor, Dr. Levine. In his retaliation claim, it\nwas the Chair of Internal Medicine, Dr. Fitz. The proof\nrequired for each claim differed, too. For the status-based\nclaim, respondent was required to show instances of racial\nslurs, disparate treatment, and other indications of\nnationality-driven animus by Dr. Levine. Respondent’s\nretaliation claim, by contrast, relied on the theory that Dr.\nFitz was committed to exonerating Dr. Levine and wished\nto punish respondent for besmirching her reputation.\nSeparately instructed on each type of claim, the jury re-\nturned a separate verdict for each, albeit with a single\ndamages award. And the Court of Appeals treated each\nclaim separately, too, finding insufficient evidence on the\nclaim of status-based discrimination.\n   If it were proper to apply the motivating-factor standard\nto respondent’s retaliation claim, the University might\nwell be subject to liability on account of Dr. Fitz’s alleged\ndesire to exonerate Dr. Levine, even if it could also be\nshown that the terms of the affiliation agreement pre-\ncluded the Hospital’s hiring of respondent and that the\nUniversity would have sought to prevent respondent’s\nhiring in order to honor that agreement in any event. That\n20     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nresult would be inconsistent with the both the text and\npurpose of Title VII.\n   In sum, Title VII defines the term “unlawful employ-\nment practice” as discrimination on the basis of any of\nseven prohibited criteria: race, color, religion, sex, national\norigin, opposition to employment discrimination, and\nsubmitting or supporting a complaint about employment\ndiscrimination. The text of §2000e–2(m) mentions just the\nfirst five of these factors, the status-based ones; and it\nomits the final two, which deal with retaliation. When it\nadded §2000e–2(m) to Title VII in 1991, Congress inserted\nit within the section of the statute that deals only with\nthose same five criteria, not the section that deals with\nretaliation claims or one of the sections that apply to all\nclaims of unlawful employment practices. And while the\nCourt has inferred a congressional intent to prohibit retal-\niation when confronted with broadly worded antidiscrimi-\nnation statutes, Title VII’s detailed structure makes that\ninference inappropriate here. Based on these textual and\nstructural indications, the Court now concludes as follows:\nTitle VII retaliation claims must be proved according to\ntraditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened\ncausation test stated in §2000e–2(m). This requires proof\nthat the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in\nthe absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the\nemployer.\n                            IV\n  Respondent and the Government also argue that apply-\ning the motivating-factor provision’s lessened causation\nstandard to retaliation claims would be consistent with\nlongstanding agency views, contained in a guidance man-\nual published by the EEOC. It urges that those views are\nentitled to deference under this Court’s decision in Skid­\nmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134 (1944). See National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U. S. 101,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            21\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n110, n. 6 (2002). The weight of deference afforded to\nagency interpretations under Skidmore depends upon “the\nthoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of\nits reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pro-\nnouncements, and all those factors which give it power to\npersuade.” 323 U. S., at 140; see Vance, post, at 9, n. 4.\n   According to the manual in question, the causation\nelement of a retaliation claim is satisfied if “there is credi-\nble direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the\nchallenged action,” regardless of whether there is also\n“[e]vidence as to [a] legitimate motive.” 2 EEOC Compli-\nance Manual §8–II(E)(1), pp. 614:0007–614:0008 (Mar.\n2003). After noting a division of authority as to whether\nmotivating-factor or but-for causation should apply to\nretaliation claims, the manual offers two rationales in\nsupport of adopting the former standard. The first is that\n“[c]ourts have long held that the evidentiary framework\nfor proving [status-based] discrimination . . . also applies\nto claims of discrimination based on retaliation.” Id., at\n614:0008, n. 45. Second, the manual states that “an inter-\npretation . . . that permits proven retaliation to go unpun-\nished undermines the purpose of the anti-retaliation\nprovisions of maintaining unfettered access to the statutory\nremedial mechanism.” Ibid.\n   These explanations lack the persuasive force that is a\nnecessary precondition to deference under Skidmore. See\n323 U. S., at 140; Vance, post, at 9, n. 4. As to the first\nrationale, while the settled judicial construction of a par-\nticular statute is of course relevant in ascertaining statu-\ntory meaning, see Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580–\n581 (1978), the manual’s discussion fails to address the\nparticular interplay among the status-based discrimina-\ntion provision (§2000e–2(a)), the antiretaliation provision\n(§2000e–3(a)), and the motivating-factor provision\n(§2000e–2(m)). Other federal antidiscrimination statutes\ndo not have the structure of statutory subsections that\n22     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncontrol the outcome at issue here. The manual’s failure to\naddress the specific provisions of this statutory scheme,\ncoupled with the generic nature of its discussion of the\ncausation standards for status-based discrimination and\nretaliation claims, call the manual’s conclusions into\nserious question. See Kentucky Retirement Systems v.\nEEOC, 554 U. S. 135, 149–150 (2008).\n   The manual’s second argument is unpersuasive, too; for\nits reasoning is circular. It asserts the lessened causation\nstandard is necessary in order to prevent “proven retalia-\ntion” from “go[ing] unpunished.” 2 EEOC Compliance\nManual §8–II(E)(1), at 614:0008, n. 45. Yet this assumes\nthe answer to the central question at issue here, which is\nwhat causal relationship must be shown in order to prove\nretaliation.\n   Respondent’s final argument, in which he is not joined\nby the United States, is that even if §2000e–2(m) does not\ncontrol the outcome in this case, the standard applied by\nPrice Waterhouse should control instead. That assertion is\nincorrect. First, this position is foreclosed by the 1991\nAct’s amendments to Title VII. As noted above, Price\nWaterhouse adopted a complex burden-shifting frame-\nwork. Congress displaced this framework by enacting\n§2000e–2(m) (which adopts the motivating-factor standard\nfor status-based discrimination claims) and §2000e–\n5(g)(2)(B) (which replaces employers’ total defense with a\nremedial limitation). See Gross, 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2,\n177, n. 3, 178, n. 5. Given the careful balance of lessened\ncausation and reduced remedies Congress struck in the\n1991 Act, there is no reason to think that the different\nbalance articulated by Price Waterhouse somehow sur-\nvived that legislation’s passage. Second, even if this ar-\ngument were still available, it would be inconsistent with\nthe Gross Court’s reading (and the plain textual meaning)\nof the word “because” as it appears in both §623(a) and\n§2000e–3(a).

The University claims that a fair application of this\nstandard, which is more demanding than the motivating-\nfactor standard adopted by the Court of Appeals, entitles\nit to judgment as a matter of law. It asks the Court to so\nhold. That question, however, is better suited to resolu-\ntion by courts closer to the facts of this case.

S. C.\n§2000e et seq., makes it an “unlawful employment prac­\ntice” to “discriminate against any individual . . . because of\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\norigin.” §2000e–2(a) (emphasis added). Backing up that\ncore provision, Title VII also makes it an “unlawful em­\nployment practice” to discriminate against any individual\n“because” the individual has complained of, opposed, or\nparticipated in a proceeding about, prohibited discrimina­\ntion. §2000e–3(a) (emphasis added). This form of discrim­\nination is commonly called “retaliation,” although Title VII\nitself does not use that term. The Court has recognized\nthat effective protection against retaliation, the office of\n§2000e–3(a), is essential to securing “a workplace where\nindividuals are not discriminated against because of their\nracial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.” Burling­\nton N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White, 548 U. S. 53, 63 (2006)\n(Burlington Northern). That is so because “fear of retalia­\ntion is the leading reason why people stay silent” about\nthe discrimination they have encountered or observed.\nCrawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and\nDavidson Cty., 555 U. S. 271, 279 (2009) (internal quota­\ntion marks and brackets omitted).\n2      UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

NASSAR\n\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\n   Similarly worded, the ban on discrimination and the ban\non retaliation against a discrimination complainant have\ntraveled together: Title VII plaintiffs often raise the two pro­\nvisions in tandem. Today’s decision, however, drives a\nwedge between the twin safeguards in so-called “mixed­\nmotive” cases. To establish discrimination, all agree, the\ncomplaining party need show only that race, color, reli­\ngion, sex, or national origin was “a motivating factor” in\nan employer’s adverse action; an employer’s proof that\n“other factors also motivated the [action]” will not defeat\nthe discrimination claim. §2000e–2(m). But a retaliation\nclaim, the Court insists, must meet a stricter standard:\nThe claim will fail unless the complainant shows “but-for”\ncausation, i.e., that the employer would not have taken the\nadverse employment action but for a design to retaliate.\n   In so reining in retaliation claims, the Court misappre­\nhends what our decisions teach: Retaliation for complain­\ning about discrimination is tightly bonded to the core pro­\nhibition and cannot be disassociated from it. Indeed,\nthis Court has explained again and again that “retaliation\nin response to a complaint about [proscribed] discrimina­\ntion is discrimination” on the basis of the characteristic\nCongress sought to immunize against adverse employment\naction. Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167,\n179, n. 3 (2005) (emphasis added; internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   The Court shows little regard for the trial judges who\nwill be obliged to charge discrete causation standards\nwhen a claim of discrimination “because of,” e.g., race is\ncoupled with a claim of discrimination “because” the indi­\nvidual has complained of race discrimination. And jurors\nwill puzzle over the rhyme or reason for the dual stand­\nards. Of graver concern, the Court has seized on a provi­\nsion, §2000e–2(m), adopted by Congress as part of an\nendeavor to strengthen Title VII, and turned it into a\nmeasure reducing the force of the ban on retaliation.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

A spe­\ncialist in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, Nassar was a faculty\nmember of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical\nCenter (UTSW) from 1995 until 2006, save for a period\nduring which he left his employment to continue his edu­\ncation. UTSW is affiliated with Parkland Hospital and,\nlike other faculty members at the University, Nassar also\nworked as a physician at the Hospital. Beginning in 2001,\nNassar served as Associate Medical Director of the Hospi­\ntal’s Amelia Court Clinic.\n   Until 2004, Dr. Phillip Keiser, Medical Director of the\nClinic, was Nassar’s principal supervisor. In that year,\nUTSW hired Dr. Beth Levine to oversee the Clinic and to\nsupervise Keiser. Before Levine commenced her employ­\nment at UTSW, she interviewed her potential subordi­\nnates. Meeting with other Clinic doctors for only 15 to 20\nminutes, Levine spent an hour and a half with Nassar,\nengaging in a detailed review of his resume and reading\nfrom a list of prepared questions.

To that end, Nassar engaged in discussions\nwith the Hospital about dropping his affiliation with\nUTSW and retaining his post at Parkland. Although he\nwas initially told that an affiliation agreement between\nUTSW and Parkland obliged Parkland to fill its staff\nphysician posts with UTSW faculty, talks with the Hos­\npital continued. Eventually, Parkland verbally offered\nNassar a position as a staff physician. See App. 67–71,\n214–216, 326–330.\n  In July 2006, Nassar resigned from his position at\nUTSW. “The primary reason [for his] resignation,” Nassar\nwrote in a letter to Fitz, “[was] the continuing harassment\nand discrimination . . . by . . . Dr. Beth Levine.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 5 (internal quotation marks omitted).

App. to Pet. for\nCert. 6.\n   On the retaliation claim, the District Court instructed\nthe jury that Nassar “[did] not have to prove that retalia­\ntion was [UTSW’s] only motive, but he [had to] prove that\n[UTSW] acted at least in part to retaliate.” Id., at 47. The\njury found UTSW liable for both constructive discharge\nand retaliation. At the remedial phase, the judge charged\nthe jury not to award damages for “actions which [UTSW]\nprove[d] by a preponderance of the evidence . . . it would\nhave taken even if it had not considered . . . Nassar’s\nprotected activity.” Id., at 42–43. Finding that UTSW\nhad not met its proof burden, the jury awarded Nassar\n$438,167.66 in backpay and $3,187,500 in compensatory\ndamages. Id., at 43–44.1\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in\npart.2 Responding to UTSW’s argument that the District\nCourt erred in instructing the jury on a mixed-motive\ntheory of retaliation, the Fifth Circuit held that the in­\nstruction conformed to Circuit precedent. 674 F. 3d 448,\n454, n. 16 (2012) (citing Smith v.

That ruling is\nnot contested here.\n  3 The Fifth Circuit has since reversed course in an unpublished opin­\n\nion, concluding that §2000e–2(m)’s motivating-factor prescription does\nnot apply to retaliation claims.

Antidiscrimination provisions,\nthe Court has reasoned, endeavor to create a workplace\nwhere individuals are not treated differently on account\nof race, ethnicity, religion, or sex.         See Burlington\nNorthern, 548 U. S., at 63. Antiretaliation provisions\n“see[k] to secure that primary objective by preventing an\nemployer from interfering . . . with an employee’s efforts to\nsecure or advance enforcement of [antidiscrimination]\nguarantees.” Ibid. As the Court has comprehended, “Title\nVII depends for its enforcement upon the cooperation of\nemployees who are willing to file complaints and act as\nwitnesses.” Id., at 67. “ ‘[E]ffective enforcement,’ ” there­\nfore, can “ ‘only be expected if employees . . . [feel] free to\napproach officials with their grievances.’ ” Ibid. (quoting\nMitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U. S. 288,\n292 (1960)). See also Crawford, 555 U. S., at 279.\n   Adverting to the close connection between discrimina­\ntion and retaliation for complaining about discrimination,\nthis Court has held, in a line of decisions unbroken until\ntoday, that a ban on discrimination encompasses retalia­\ntion. In Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S.\n229, 237 (1969), the Court determined that 42 U. S. C.\n§1982, which provides that “[a]ll citizens of the United\nStates shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white\ncitizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\nconvey real and personal property,” protected a white man\nwho suffered retaliation after complaining of discrimina­\ntion against his black tenant. Jackson v. Birmingham\nBoard of Education elaborated on that holding in the\ncontext of sex discrimination. “Retaliation against a per­\nson because [he] has complained of sex discrimination,”\nthe Court found it inescapably evident, “is another form of\nintentional sex discrimination.” 544 U. S., at 173. As the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nCourt explained:\n     “Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It\n     is a form of ‘discrimination’ because the complainant is\n     being subject to differential treatment. Moreover, re­\n     taliation is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because\n     it is an intentional response to the nature of the com­\n     plaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.” Id., at\n     173–174 (citations omitted).\n   Jackson interpreted Title IX of the Educational\nAmendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. §1681(a). Noting that\nthe legislation followed three years after Sullivan, the\nCourt found it “not only appropriate but also realistic to\npresume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with\nSullivan and . . . expected its enactment of Title IX to be\ninterpreted in conformity with it.” 544 U. S., at 176 (in­\nternal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n   Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, 553 U. S. 474 (2008), was similarly\nreasoned. The Court there held that the federal-sector\nprovision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n1967 (ADEA), 29 U. S. C. §633a(a), barring discrimination\n“based on age,” also proscribes retaliation. 553 U. S., at\n479–491. “What Jackson said about the relationship\nbetween Sullivan and the enactment of Title IX,” the\nCourt observed, “can be said as well about the relation-\nship between Sullivan and the enactment of the ADEA’s\nfederal-sector provision.” Id., at 485. See also CBOCS West,\nInc. v. Humphries, 553 U. S. 442, 447–457 (2008) (retalia­\ntion for race discrimination constitutes discrimination\nbased on race under 42 U. S. C. §1981). There is no sound\nreason in this case to stray from the decisions in Sullivan,\nJackson, Gómez-Pérez, and CBOCS West.\n                          III\n                           A\n  The Title VII provision key here, §2000e–2(m), states\nthat “an unlawful employment practice is established\n8       UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

See 105 Stat. 1071. The amendments were\nintended to provide “additional protections against unlaw­\nful discrimination in employment,” id., §2(3), and to “re­\nspon[d] to a number of . . . decisions by [this Court] that\nsharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness” of antidis­\ncrimination laws, H. R. Rep. No. 102–40, pt. II, pp. 2–4\n(1991) (hereinafter House Report Part II) (citing, inter\nalia, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164\n(1989); Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755 (1989); Lorance v.\nAT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989)).\n   Among the decisions found inadequately protective was\nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989). A\nplurality of the Court in that case held that the words\n“because of ” in §2000e–2(a) encompass claims challenging\nan employment decision attributable to “mixed motives,”\ni.e., one motivated by both legitimate and illegitimate\nfactors. See id., at 240–242.4 A Title VII plaintiff, the\nplurality concluded, need show only that a prohibited\nfactor contributed to the employment decision—not that it\nwas the but-for or sole cause. Id., at 240–244. But see id.,\nat 281–282 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). An employer would\nnot be liable, however, if it could show by a preponderance\nof the evidence that it would have taken the same action\nabsent the illegitimate motive. Id., at 244–245.\n——————\n  4 Justices White and O’Connor separately concurred and would have\n\nrequired the Title VII plaintiff to show that protected characteristics\nconstituted a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment\ndecision. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 259 (1989)\n(White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 265 (O’Connor, J., concur­\nring in judgment).\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress endorsed the plurality’s conclusion that, to be\nactionable under Title VII, discrimination must be a moti­\nvating factor in, but need not be the but-for cause of, an\nadverse employment action. See House Report Part II, at\n18. Congress disagreed with the Court, however, insofar\nas the Price Waterhouse decision allowed an employer to\nescape liability by showing that the same action would\nhave been taken regardless of improper motive. House\nReport Part II, at 18. See also H. R. Rep. No. 102–40,\npt. I, pp. 45–48 (1991) (hereinafter House Report Part I).\n“If Title VII’s ban on discrimination in employment is to\nbe meaningful,” the House Report explained, “victims of\nintentional discrimination must be able to obtain relief,\nand perpetrators of discrimination must be held liable for\ntheir actions.” House Report Part II, at 18.\n   Superseding Price Waterhouse in part, Congress sought\nto “restore” the rule of decision followed by several Cir­\ncuits that any discrimination “actually shown to play a\nrole in a contested employment decision may be the sub­\nject of liability.” House Report Part II, at 18. See also\nHouse Report Part I, at 48. To that end, Congress enacted\n§2000e–2(m) and §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). The latter provides\nthat an employer’s proof that an adverse employment\naction would have been taken in any event does not shield\nthe employer from liability; such proof, however, limits the\nplaintiff ’s remedies to declaratory or injunctive relief,\nattorney’s fees, and costs.\n   Critically, the rule Congress intended to “restore” was\nnot limited to substantive discrimination. As the House\nReport explained, “the Committee endors[ed] . . . the\ndecisional law” in Bibbs v. Block, 778 F. 2d 1318 (CA8\n1985) (en banc), which held that a violation of Title VII\nis established when the trier of fact determines that “an\nunlawful motive played some part in the employment\ndecision or decisional process.” Id., at 1323; see House\nReport Part I, at 48. Prior to the 1991 Civil Rights Act,\n10     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL \n\n                   CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                  GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\nBibbs had been applied to retaliation claims. See, e.g.,\nJohnson v. Legal Servs. of Arkansas, Inc., 813 F. 2d 893,\n900 (CA8 1987) (“Should the court find that retaliation\nplayed some invidious part in the [plaintiff ’s] termination,\na violation of Title VII will be established under Bibbs.”).\nSee also EEOC v. General Lines, Inc., 865 F. 2d 1555, 1560\n(CA10 1989).\n                             B\n   There is scant reason to think that, despite Congress’\naim to “restore and strengthen . . . laws that ban discrimi­\nnation in employment,” House Report Part II, at 2, Con­\ngress meant to exclude retaliation claims from the newly\nenacted “motivating factor” provision. Section 2000e–2(m)\nprovides that an “unlawful employment practice is estab­\nlished” when the plaintiff shows that a protected charac­\nteristic was a factor driving “any employment practice.”\nTitle VII, in §2000e–3(a), explicitly denominates retalia­\ntion, like status-based discrimination, an “unlawful em­\nployment practice.”     Because “any employment prac-\ntice” necessarily encompasses practices prohibited\nunder §2000e–3(a), §2000e–2(m), by its plain terms, covers\nretaliation.\n   Notably, when it enacted §2000e–2(m), Congress did\nnot tie the new provision specifically to §§2000e–2(a)–(d),\nwhich proscribe discrimination “because of ” race, color,\nreligion, gender, or national origin. Rather, Congress\nadded an entirely new provision to codify the causation\nstandard, one encompassing “any employment practice.”\n§2000e–2(m).\n   Also telling, §2000e–2(m) is not limited to situations in\nwhich the complainant’s race, color, religion, sex, or na­\ntional origin motivates the employer’s action. In contrast,\nTitle VII’s substantive antidiscrimination provisions refer\nto the protected characteristics of the complaining party.\nSee §§2000e–2(a)(1)–(2), (c)(2) (referring to “such individu­\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

It chose, instead, to bring within §2000e–\n2(m) “any employment practice.” To cut out retaliation\nfrom §2000e–2(m)’s scope, one must be blind to that\nchoice. Cf. Jackson, 544 U. S., at 179, n. 3 (omission of\nreference to the complaining party’s sex in Title IX sup­\nports the conclusion that the statute protects a male plain­\ntiff from retaliation in response to complaints about sex\ndiscrimination against women).\n                              C\n  From the inception of §2000e–2(m), the agency entrusted\nwith interpretation of Title VII and superintendence of\nthe Act’s administration, the EEOC, see §2000e–5, has\nunderstood the provision to cover retaliation claims.\nShortly after Congress amended Title VII to include the\nmotivating-factor provision, the EEOC issued guidance\nadvising that, “[a]lthough [§2000e–2(m)] does not specify\nretaliation as a basis for finding liability whenever it is a\nmotivating factor for an action, neither does it suggest\nany basis for deviating from the Commission’s long­\nstanding rule that it will find liability . . . whenever\nretaliation plays any role in an employment decision.”\nEEOC, Revised Enforcement Guidance on Recent Devel­\nopments in Disparate Treatment Theory, p. 20, n. 14 (July\n14, 1992) (hereinafter EEOC Guidance), available at\nhttp://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/disparat.html (as visited\nJune 21, 2013, and in Clerk of Court’s case file). As the\nEEOC’s initial guidance explained, “if retaliation were to\ngo unremedied, it would have a chilling effect upon the\nwillingness of individuals to speak out against employ­\nment discrimination.” Ibid.\n  In its compliance manual, the EEOC elaborated on its\n12     UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

See Skidmore v. Swift &\nCo., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944); Federal Express Corp. v.\nHolowecki, 552 U. S. 389, 399 (2008) (“[EEOC’s] policy\nstatements, embodied in its compliance manual and inter­\nnal directives . . . reflect a body of experience and informed\njudgment. . . . As such, they are entitled to a measure of\nrespect under the less deferential Skidmore standard.”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). If the breadth of\n§2000e–2(m) can be deemed ambiguous (although I believe\nits meaning is plain), the provision should be construed to\naccord with the EEOC’s well-reasoned and longstanding\nguidance.\n                               IV\n  The Court draws the opposite conclusion, ruling that\nretaliation falls outside the scope of §2000e–2(m). In so\nholding, the Court ascribes to Congress the unlikely pur­\npose of separating retaliation claims from discrimination\nclaims, thereby undermining the Legislature’s effort to\nfortify the protections of Title VII. None of the reasons the\nCourt offers in support of its restrictive interpretation of\n§2000e–2(m) survives inspection.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n                              A\n   The Court first asserts that reading §2000e–2(m) to\nencompass claims for retaliation “is inconsistent with the\nprovision’s plain language.” Ante, at 12. The Court\nacknowledges, however, that “the text of the motivating­\nfactor provision . . . begins by referring to unlawful em­\nployment practices,” a term that undeniably includes\nretaliation. Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nNevermind that, the Court continues, for §2000e–2(m)\ngoes on to reference as “motivating factor[s]” only “race,\ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” The Court thus\nsees retaliation as a protected activity entirely discrete\nfrom status-based discrimination. Ibid.\n   This vision of retaliation as a separate concept runs up\nagainst precedent. See supra, at 6–7. Until today, the\nCourt has been clear eyed on just what retaliation is: a\nmanifestation of status-based discrimination. As Jackson\nexplained in the context of sex discrimination, “retalia­\ntion is discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ because it is\nan intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an\nallegation of sex discrimination.” 544 U. S., at 174.\n   The Court does not take issue with Jackson’s insight.\nInstead, it distinguishes Jackson and like cases on the\nground that they concerned laws in which “Congress’\ntreatment of the subject of prohibited discrimination was\nboth broad and brief.” Ante, at 15. Title VII, by contrast,\n“is a detailed statutory scheme,” that “enumerates specific\nunlawful employment practices,” “defines key terms,” and\n“exempts certain types of employers.” Ante, at 16. Accord­\ningly, the Court says, “it would be improper to indulge\n[the] suggestion that Congress meant to incorporate [in\nTitle VII] the default rules that apply only when Congress\nwrites a broad and undifferentiated statute.” Ibid.\n   It is strange logic indeed to conclude that when Con­\ngress homed in on retaliation and codified the proscrip­\ntion, as it did in Title VII, Congress meant protection\n14        UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

It is hardly surprising, then, that\nour jurisprudence does not support the Court’s conclusion.\nIn Gómez-Pérez, the Court construed the federal-sector\nprovision of the ADEA, which proscribes “discrimination\nbased on age,” 29 U. S. C. §633a(a), to bar retaliation. The\nCourt did so mindful that another part of the Act, the\nprovision applicable to private-sector employees, explicitly\nproscribes retaliation and, moreover, “set[s] out a specific\nlist of forbidden employer practices.” Gómez-Pérez, 553\nU. S., at 486–487 (citing 29 U. S. C. §§623(a) and (d)).\n   The Court suggests that “the la[w] at issue in . . .\nGómez-Pérez [was a] broad, general ba[r] on discrimina­\ntion.” Ante, at 15. But, as our opinion in that case ob­\nserves, some of the ADEA’s provisions are brief, broad,\nand general, while others are extensive, specific, and\ndetailed. 553 U. S., at 487. So too of Title VII. See ibid.\n(“The ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned di­\nrectly after Title VII’s federal-sector discrimination ban . . .\n[which] contains a broad prohibition of ‘discrimination,’\nrather than a list of specific prohibited practices.” (some\ninternal quotation marks omitted)). It makes little sense\nto apply a different mode of analysis to Title VII’s §2000e–\n2(m) and the ADEA’s §633a(a), both brief statements on\ndiscrimination in the context of larger statutory schemes.5\n——————\n  5 The Court obscures the inconsistency between today’s opinion and\nGómez-Pérez by comparing §633a to all of Title VII. See ante, at 16\n(“Unlike Title IX, §1981, §1982, and the federal-sector provisions of the\nADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory scheme.”). That comparison is\ninapt. Like Title VII, the ADEA is a “detailed statutory scheme.” Ibid.\nCompare ibid. (citing Title VII provisions that proscribe status-based\ndiscrimination by employers, employment agencies, labor organiza­\ntions, and training programs; bar retaliation; prohibit advertising a\npreference for certain protected characteristics; define terms; exempt\ncertain employers; and create an agency with rulemaking and enforce­\nment authority), with 29 U.

The same is true\nof the ADA, the Court says, as “Congress provided not\njust a general prohibition on discrimination ‘because of\n[an individual’s] disability,’ but also seven paragraphs of\ndetailed description of the practices that would constitute\nthe prohibited discrimination . . . [a]nd . . . an express\nantiretaliation provision.” Ante, at 17.\n  This argument is underwhelming. Yes, Congress has\nsometimes addressed retaliation explicitly in antidiscrim­\nination statutes. When it does so, there is no occasion for\ninterpretation. But when Congress simply targets dis­\ncrimination “because of ” protected characteristics, or, as\nin §2000e–2(m), refers to employment practices motivated\nby race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, how should\ncourts comprehend those phrases? They should read them\ninformed by this Court’s consistent holdings that such\nphrases draw in retaliation, for, in truth, retaliation is a\n——————\nination by employers, employment agencies, and labor unions; barring\nretaliation; prohibiting advertising a preference for employees of a\nparticular age), §628 (granting rulemaking authority to the EEOC), and\n§630 (defining terms). Thus, §633a is just like §2000e–2(m) in the\nrelevant respect: both are single provisions comprised within a detailed\nscheme.\n  6 Now codified at 42 U. S. C. §2000e–1(b), §109(b) provides:\n\n  “It shall not be unlawful under §2000e–2 or 2000e–3 . . . for an em­\nployer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited by such section, with\nrespect to an employee in a workplace in a foreign country if compliance\nwith such section would cause such employer . . . to violate the law of\nthe foreign country in which such workplace is located.” The provision\nwas framed to accord with this Court’s decision in EEOC v. Arabian\nAmerican Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991).\n16     UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL \n\n                   CENTER v.

Retaliation, the Court therefore\nconcludes, should not be read into §2000e–2(m). Ante, at\n13–14.\n  The Court’s reasoning rests on a false premise. Section\n2000e–2 does not deal exclusively with discrimination\nbased on protected characteristics. The provisions stated\nafter §§2000e–2(a)–(d) deal with a variety of matters,\nsome of them unquestionably covering retaliation. For\nexample, §2000e–2(n), enacted in tandem with and located\nimmediately after §2000e–2(m), limits opportunities to\ncollaterally attack employment practices installed to im­\nplement a consent judgment. Section 2000e–2(n) applies\nbeyond the substantive antidiscrimination provisions in\n§2000e–2; indeed, it applies beyond Title VII to encom­\npass claims “under the Constitution or [other] Federal\ncivil rights laws.” §2000e–2(n)(1)(A). Thus, if an employee\nsues for retaliatory discharge in violation of §2000e–3(a),\nand a consent judgment orders reinstatement, any person\nadversely affected by that judgment (e.g., an employee\nwho loses seniority as a result) would generally be barred\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  17\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nfrom attacking the judgment if she was given actual no-\ntice of the proposed order and a reasonable opportunity to\npresent objections. That Congress placed the consent­\njudgment provision in §2000e–2 and not in §2000e–3 is of\nno moment. As the text of the provision plainly conveys,\n§2000e–2(n) would reach consent judgments settling\ncomplaints about retaliation, just as it would cover con­\nsent judgments settling complaints about status-based\ndiscrimination.\n   Section 2000e–2(g) is similarly illustrative. Under that\nprovision, “it shall not be an unlawful employment prac­\ntice for an employer . . . to discharge [an] individual” if she\nfails to fulfill any requirement imposed in the interest of\nnational security. Because §2000e–3(a) renders retal-\niation an “unlawful employment practice,” §2000e–2(g)’s\nexemption would no doubt apply to a Title VII retaliatory\ndischarge claim. Given these provisions, Congress’ place­\nment of the motivating-factor provision within §2000e–2\ncannot bear the weight the Court places on it.7\n                            C\n  The Court gives no deference to the EEOC’s longstand­\ning position that §2000e–2(m) applies to retaliation be­\ncause, the Court charges, the agency did not “address the\nparticular interplay among the status-based antidiscrimi­\n——————\n  7 The Court’s assertion that we “confronted a similar structural dis­\n\npute in Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156 (1981),” ante, at 17, as­\nsumes its own conclusion. As the Court explains, in Nakshian, the\nplaintiff argued that §633a of the ADEA afforded the right to trial by\njury. 453 U. S., at 157. An amendment to the private-sector provision,\ncodified at 29 U. S. C. §626(c), granted that right to plaintiffs suing\nprivate employers, as well as state and local governmental entities.\nBut no one argued in Nakshian that the private-sector amendment\napplied to the federal-sector provision. Hence, Nakshian’s holding that\nthe ADEA does not permit a federal-sector plaintiff to try her case\nbefore a jury is relevant only if the Court is correct that §2000e–2(m)\ndoes not cover retaliation claims.\n18     UNIVERSITY OF TEX.

Not so.\n    In its compliance manual, the EEOC noted that some\ncourts had concluded that §2000e–2(m) does not cover\nretaliation, citing as an example Woodson v. Scott Paper\nCo., 109 F. 3d 913 (CA3 1997). In that decision, the Third\nCircuit acknowledged it was “given pause by the fact that\n. . . courts have generally borrowed from discrimination\nlaw in determining the burdens and order of proof in\nretaliation cases.” Id., at 934. One could therefore say,\nthe Third Circuit continued, that “Congress knew of the\npractice of borrowing in retaliation cases, and presumed\nthat courts would continue this practice after the 1991\nAct.” Ibid.\n    While Woodson rejected that argument, the EEOC\nfound it sound.       See EEOC Compliance Manual, at\n614:0008, n. 45 (“Courts have long held that the eviden­\ntiary framework for proving employment discrimination\nbased on race, sex, or other protected class status also\napplies to claims of discrimination based on retaliation.”).\nSee also EEOC Guidance, at 20, n. 14 (while §2000e–2(m)\ndoes not explicitly refer to retaliation, nothing in the\nprovision calls for deviation from the longstanding practice\nof finding liability when a plaintiff demonstrates that\nretaliatory intent motivated an adverse employment\ndecision). By adverting to Woodson, the EEOC made clear\nthat it considered the very argument the Court relies on\ntoday. Putting down the agency’s appraisal as “generic,”\nante, at 22, is thus conspicuously unfair comment.\n    The Court’s second reason for refusing to accord de-\nference to the EEOC fares no better. The EEOC’s conclu-\nsion that “the lessened causation standard is necessary in\norder to prevent ‘proven retaliation’ from ‘go[ing] unpun­\nished,’ ” the Court reasons, “is circular” because it “as­\nsumes the answer to the central question at issue here,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nwhich is what causal relationship must be shown in order\nto prove retaliation.” Ibid. That reasoning will not wash.\nUnder the motivating-factor test set out in §2000e–2(m), a\nplaintiff prevails if she shows that proscribed conduct “was\na motivating factor” for the adverse employment action\nshe encountered, “even though other factors also moti-\nvated the [action].” She will succeed, although the relief to\nwhich she is entitled may be restricted. See supra, at 9.\nUnder the Court’s view, proof that retaliation was a factor\nmotivating an adverse employment action is insufficient to\nestablish liability under §2000e–3(a). The Court’s but-for\ncausation standard does not mean that the plaintiff has\nfailed to prove she was subjected to unlawful retaliation.\nIt does mean, however, that proof of a retaliatory motive\nalone yields no victory for the plaintiff. Put otherwise, the\nCourt’s view “permits proven retaliation to go unpun­\nished,” just as the EEOC recognized. See EEOC Compli­\nance Manual, at 614:0008, n. 45.\n                               V\n\n                               A\n\n  Having narrowed §2000e–2(m) to exclude retaliation\nclaims, the Court turns to Gross v. FBL Financial Ser­\nvices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167 (2009), to answer the question\npresented: Whether a plaintiff must demonstrate but-for\ncausation to establish liability under §2000e–3(a).\n  The Court held in Gross that, in contrast to Title VII,\n§623(a) of the ADEA does not authorize any age discrimi­\nnation claim asserting mixed motives. Explaining that\nuniform interpretation of the two statutes is sometimes\nunwarranted, the Court noted in Gross that the phrase\n“because of . . . age” in §623(a) has not been read “to bar\ndiscrimination against people of all ages, even though the\nCourt had previously interpreted ‘because of . . . race [or]\nsex’ in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all\nraces and both sexes.” 557 U. S., at 175, n. 2. Yet Gross,\n20       UNIVERSITY OF TEX. SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL \n\n                     CENTER v. NASSAR\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\nwhich took pains to distinguish ADEA claims from Title\nVII claims, is invoked by the Court today as pathmarking.\nSee ante, at 2 (“The holding and analysis of [Gross] are\ninstructive here.”).\n   The word “because” in Title VII’s retaliation provision,\n§2000e–3(a), the Court tells us, should be interpreted not\nto accord with the interpretation of that same word in the\ncompanion status-based discrimination provision of Ti-\ntle VII, §2000e–2(a). Instead, statutory lines should be\ncrossed: The meaning of “because” in Title VII’s retaliation\nprovision should be read to mean just what the Court held\n“because” means for ADEA-liability purposes. But see\nGross, 557 U. S., at 174 (“When conducting statutory\ninterpretation, we ‘must be careful not to apply rules\napplicable under one statute to a different statute without\ncareful and critical examination.’ ”(quoting Holowecki, 552\nU. S., at 393)). In other words, the employer prevailed in\nGross because, according to the Court, the ADEA’s anti­\ndiscrimination prescription is not like Title VII’s. But the\nemployer prevails again in Nassar’s case, for there is no\n“meaningful textual difference,” ante, at 11, between the\nADEA’s use of “because” and the use of the same word in\nTitle VII’s retaliation provision. What sense can one make\nof this other than “heads the employer wins, tails the\nemployee loses”?\n   It is a standard principle of statutory interpretation that\nidentical phrases appearing in the same statute—here,\nTitle VII—ordinarily bear a consistent meaning. See\nPowerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U. S.\n224, 232 (2007). Following that principle, Title VII’s\nretaliation provision, like its status-based discrimination\nprovision, would permit mixed-motive claims, and the\nsame causation standard would apply to both provisions.\n                               B\n     The Court’s decision to construe §2000e–3(a) to require\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

Recall that Price\nWaterhouse interpreted “because of ” in §2000e–2(a) to\npermit mixed-motive claims. See supra, at 8. The Court\ntoday rejects the proposition that, if §2000e–2(m) does not\ncover retaliation, such claims are governed by Price Water­\nhouse’s burden-shifting framework, i.e., if the plaintiff\nshows that discrimination was a motivating factor in an\nadverse employment action, the defendant may escape\nliability only by showing it would have taken the same\naction had there been no illegitimate motive. It is wrong\nto revert to Price Waterhouse, the Court says, because the\n1991 Civil Rights Act’s amendments to Title VII abrogated\nthat decision.\n   This conclusion defies logic. Before the 1991 amend­\nments, several courts had applied Price Waterhouse’s\nburden-shifting framework to retaliation claims.8 In the\nCourt’s view, Congress designed §2000e–2(m)’s motivating­\nfactor standard not only to exclude retaliation claims, but\nalso to override, sub silentio, Circuit precedent apply-\ning the Price Waterhouse framework to such claims. And\nwith what did the 1991 Congress replace the Price Water­\nhouse burden-shifting framework? With a but-for causa­\ntion requirement Gross applied to the ADEA 17 years\nafter the 1991 amendments to Title VII. Shut from the\nCourt’s sight is a legislative record replete with state­\nments evincing Congress’ intent to strengthen antidis­\ncrimination laws and thereby hold employers accountable\nfor prohibited discrimination. See Civil Rights Act of\n1991, §2, 105 Stat. 1071; House Report Part II, at 18.

Nor is\nthe Court concerned about the capacity of jurors to follow\ninstructions conforming to today’s decision. Causation is a\ncomplicated concept to convey to juries in the best of cir­\ncumstances. Asking jurors to determine liability based on\ndifferent standards in a single case is virtually certain to\nsow confusion. That would be tolerable if the governing\nstatute required double standards, but here, for the rea­\nsons already stated, it does not.\n                             VI \n\n                              A\n\n   The Court’s assertion that the but-for cause require­\nment it adopts necessarily follows from §2000e–3(a)’s use\nof the word “because” fails to convince. Contrary to the\nCourt’s suggestion, see ante, at 5–6, the word “because”\ndoes not inevitably demand but-for causation to the exclu­\nsion of all other causation formulations. When more than\none factor contributes to a plaintiff ’s injury, but-for causa­\ntion is problematic. See, e.g., 1 Restatement (Third) of\nTorts §27, Comment a, p. 385 (2005) (noting near univer­\nsal agreement that the but-for standard is inappropriate\nwhen multiple sufficient causes exist) (hereinafter Re­\nstatement Third); Restatement of Torts §9, Comment b,\np. 18 (1934) (legal cause is a cause that is a “substantial\nfactor in bringing about the harm”).\n   When an event is “overdetermined,” i.e., when two forces\ncreate an injury each alone would be sufficient to cause,\nmodern tort law permits the plaintiff to prevail upon\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

In contrast, under\nthe Court’s approach (which it erroneously calls “textbook\ntort law,” ante, at 6), a Title VII plaintiff alleging retalia­\ntion cannot establish liability if her firing was prompted\nby both legitimate and illegitimate factors. Ante, at\n18–19.\n   Today’s opinion rehashes arguments rightly rejected in\nPrice Waterhouse. Concurring in the judgment in that\ncase, Justice O’Connor recognized the disconnect between\nthe standard the dissent advocated, which would have\nimposed on the plaintiff the burden of showing but-for\ncausation, see 490 U. S., at 282, 286–287 (KENNEDY, J.,\ndissenting), and the common-law doctrines on which the\ndissent relied. As Justice O’Connor explained:\n      “[I]n the area of tort liability, from whence the dis­\n      sent’s ‘but-for’ standard of causation is derived, . . .\n      the law has long recognized that in certain ‘civil cases’\n      leaving the burden of persuasion on the plaintiff to\n      prove ‘but-for’ causation would be both unfair and de­\n      structive of the deterrent purposes embodied in the\n      concept of duty of care. Thus, in multiple causation\n      cases, where a breach of duty has been established,\n      the common law of torts has long shifted the burden of\n      proof to . . . defendants to prove that their negligent\n      actions were not the ‘but-for’ cause of the plaintiff ’s\n      injury.” Id., at 263–264 (concurring in judgment) (cit­\n      ing Summers v. Tice, 33 Cal. 2d 80, 84–87, 199 P. 2d\n      1, 3–4 (1948)).\nJustice Brennan’s plurality opinion was even less solici­\ntous of the dissent’s approach. Noting that, under the\nstandard embraced by the dissent in Price Waterhouse,\nneither of two sufficient forces would constitute cause even\nif either one alone would have led to the injury, the plural­\nity remarked: “We need not leave our common sense at the\ndoorstep when we interpret a statute.” 490 U.

Even if the test is\nappropriate in some tort contexts, “it is an entirely differ­\nent matter to determine a ‘but-for’ relation when . . .\nconsider[ing], not physical forces, but the mind-related\ncharacteristics that constitute motive.” Gross, 557 U. S., at\n190 (BREYER, J., dissenting). When assessing an employ­\ner’s multiple motives, “to apply ‘but-for’ causation is to\nengage in a hypothetical inquiry about what would have\nhappened if the employer’s thoughts and other circum­\nstances had been different.” Id., at 191. See also Price\nWaterhouse, 490 U. S., at 264 (opinion of O’Connor, J.)\n(“ ‘[A]t . . . times the [but-for] test demands the impossible.\nIt challenges the imagination of the trier to probe into a\npurely fanciful and unknowable state of affairs.’ ” (quoting\nMalone, Ruminations on Cause-In-Fact, 9 Stan. L. Rev.\n60, 67 (1956))).\n    This point, lost on the Court, was not lost on Congress.\nWhen Title VII was enacted, Congress considered and\nrejected an amendment that would have placed the word\n“solely” before “because of [the complainant’s] race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin.” See 110 Cong. Rec. 2728,\n13837–13838 (1964). Senator Case, a prime sponsor of\nTitle VII, commented that a “sole cause” standard would\nrender the Act “totally nugatory.” Id., at 13837. Life does\nnot shape up that way, the Senator suggested, comment­\ning “[i]f anyone ever had an action that was motivated by\na single cause, he is a different kind of animal from any\nI know of.” Ibid.\n                        *    *     *\n  The Court holds, at odds with a solid line of decisions\nrecognizing that retaliation is inextricably bound up with\nstatus-based discrimination, that §2000e–2(m) excludes\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

It then reaches outside of Title VII to\narrive at an interpretation of “because” that lacks sensitiv­\nity to the realities of life at work. In this endeavor, the\nCourt is guided neither by precedent, nor by the aims\nof legislators who formulated and amended Title VII. In-\ndeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the\nnumber of retaliation claims filed against employers. See\nante, at 18–19. Congress had no such goal in mind when\nit added §2000e–2(m) to Title VII. See House Report Part\nII, at 2. Today’s misguided judgment, along with the\njudgment in Vance v.
