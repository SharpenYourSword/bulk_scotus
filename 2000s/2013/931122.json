KEBODEAUX\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013418.      Argued April 17, 2013\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nRespondent Kebodeaux was convicted by a special court-martial of a\n  federal sex offense. After serving his sentence and receiving a bad\n  conduct discharge from the Air Force, he moved to Texas where he\n  registered with state authorities as a sex offender. Congress subse-\n  quently enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n  (SORNA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the\n  States where they live, study, and work, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(a), and\n  which applies to offenders who, when SORNA became law, had al-\n  ready completed their sentences, 28 CFR \u00a772.3. When Kebodeaux\n  moved within Texas and failed to update his registration, the Federal\n  Government prosecuted him under SORNA, and the District Court\n  convicted him. The Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that, at the time of\n  SORNA\u2019s enactment, Kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no\n  longer in any special relationship with the Federal Government. Be-\n  lieving that Kebodeaux was not required to register under the pre-\n  SORNA Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Vio-\n  lent Offender Registration Act, the court found that he had been \u201cun-\n  conditionally\u201d freed. That being so, the court held, the Federal Gov-\n  ernment lacked the power under Article I\u2019s Necessary and Proper\n  Clause to regulate his intrastate movements.\nHeld: SORNA\u2019s registration requirements as applied to Kebodeaux fall\n within the scope of Congress\u2019 authority under the Necessary and\n Proper Clause. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s critical assumption that Ke-\n bodeaux\u2019s release was unconditional, a full reading of the relevant\n statutes and regulations makes clear that at the time of his offense\n and conviction he was subject to the Wetterling Act, which imposed\n upon him registration requirements very similar to SORNA\u2019s. See,\n2                   UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a714072(i)(3)\u2013(4). The fact that these federal-law re-\n    quirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements\n    made them no less requirements of federal law. See generally United\n    States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293\u2013294. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Congress promulgated the Wetterling Act under authority\n    granted by the Military Regulation Clause, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14, and the\n    Necessary and Proper Clause. The same power that authorized Con-\n    gress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish\n    Kebodeaux\u2019s crime also authorized Congress to make the civil regis-\n    tration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.\n    And its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would\n    apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently\n    reasonable. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 102\u2013103. It was also en-\n    tirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special role to the\n    Federal Government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offend-\n    er registration requirements. See Carr v. United States, 560 U. S.\n    438, ___. Thus, Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who\n    had, prior to its enactment, been \u201cunconditionally released,\u201d but ra-\n    ther to an individual already subject to federal registration require-\n    ments enacted pursuant to the Military Regulation and Necessary\n    and Proper Clauses. SORNA somewhat modified the applicable reg-\n    istration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, in\n    order to make more uniform what had remained \u201ca patchwork of fed-\n    eral and 50 individual state registration requirements,\u201d Reynolds v.\n    United States, 565 U. S. ___, ___. No one here claims that these\n    changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have\n    found them \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means for furthering its pre-\n    existing registration ends.

ANTHONY JAMES\n                 KEBODEAUX\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 24, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 1999 a special court-martial convicted Anthony Kebo-\ndeaux, a member of the United States Air Force, of a sex\noffense. It imposed a sentence of three months\u2019 imprison-\nment and a bad conduct discharge. In 2006, several years\nafter Kebodeaux had served his sentence and been dis-\ncharged, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716901 et seq., a federal statute that requires those con-\nvicted of federal sex offenses to register in the States\nwhere they live, study, and work. \u00a716913(a); 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a). And, by regulation, the Federal Government\nmade clear that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements ap-\nply to federal sex offenders who, when SORNA became\nlaw, had already completed their sentences. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716913(d) (Attorney General\u2019s authority to issue regula-\ntions); 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2012) (regulation specifying applica-\ntion to pre-SORNA offenders).\n   We here must decide whether the Constitution\u2019s Neces-\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to\nenact SORNA\u2019s registration requirements and apply them\n2             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nto a federal offender who had completed his sentence prior\nto the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment. For purposes of an-\nswering this question, we assume that Congress has com-\nplied with the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto and Due\nProcess Clauses. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 105\u2013106\n(2003) (upholding a similar Alaska statute against ex post\nfacto challenge); Supp. Brief for Kebodeaux on Rehearing\nEn Banc in No. 08\u201351185 (CA5) (not raising any Due\nProcess challenge); Brief for Respondent (same). We\nconclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants\nCongress adequate power to enact SORNA and to apply\nit here.\n                             I\n   As we have just said, in 1999 a special court-martial\nconvicted Kebodeaux, then a member of the Air Force, of a\nfederal sex offense. He served his 3-month sentence; the\nAir Force released him with a bad conduct discharge. And\nthen he moved to Texas. In 2004 Kebodeaux registered\nas a sex offender with Texas state authorities. Brief for\nRespondent 6\u20137. In 2006 Congress enacted SORNA. In\n2007 Kebodeaux moved within Texas from San Antonio to\nEl Paso, updating his sex offender registration. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 167a\u2013168a. But later that year he returned\nto San Antonio without making the legally required sex-\noffender registration changes. Id., at 169a. And the Fed-\neral Government, acting under SORNA, prosecuted\nKebodeaux for this last-mentioned SORNA registration\nfailure.\n   A Federal District Court convicted Kebodeaux of having\nviolated SORNA. See 687 F. 3d 232, 234 (CA5 2012) (en\nbanc). On appeal a panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit initially upheld the convic-\ntion. 647 F. 3d 137 (2011) (per curiam). But the Circuit\nthen heard the appeal en banc and, by a vote of 10 to 6,\nreversed. 687 F. 3d, at 234. The court stated that, by the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntime Congress enacted SORNA, Kebodeaux had \u201cfully\nserved\u201d his sex-offense sentence; he was \u201cno longer in\nfederal custody, in the military, under any sort of super-\nvised release or parole, or in any other special relationship\nwith the federal government.\u201d Ibid.\n    The court recognized that, even before SORNA, federal\nlaw required certain federal sex offenders to register. Id.,\nat 235, n. 4. See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Chil-\ndren and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act,\n\u00a7170101, 108 Stat. 2038\u20132042. But it believed that\nthe pre-SORNA federal registration requirements did not\napply to Kebodeaux. 687 F. 3d, at 235, n. 4. Hence, in the\nCircuit\u2019s view, Kebodeaux had been \u201cunconditionally let\n. . . free.\u201d Id., at 234. And, that being so, the Federal\nGovernment lacked the power under Article I\u2019s Necessary\nand Proper Clause to regulate through registration Kebo-\ndeaux\u2019s intrastate movements. Id., at 234\u2013235. In\nparticular, the court said that after \u201cthe federal govern-\nment has unconditionally let a person free . . . the fact\nthat he once committed a crime is not a jurisdictional\nbasis for subsequent regulation and possible criminal\nprosecution.\u201d Ibid.\n    The Solicitor General sought certiorari. And, in light of\nthe fact that a Federal Court of Appeals has held a federal\nstatute unconstitutional, we granted the petition. See,\ne.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 605 (2000);\nUnited States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418, 425\n(1993).\n                             II\n  We do not agree with the Circuit\u2019s conclusion. And, in\nexplaining our reasons, we need not go much further than\nthe Circuit\u2019s critical assumption that Kebodeaux\u2019s release\nwas \u201cunconditional,\u201d i.e., that after Kebodeaux\u2019s release,\nhe was not in \u201cany . . . special relationship with the fed-\neral government.\u201d 687 F. 3d, at 234. To the contrary, the\n4              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitor General, tracing through a complex set of statu-\ntory cross-references, has pointed out that at the time of\nhis offense and conviction Kebodeaux was subject to the\nfederal Wetterling Act, an Act that imposed upon him\nregistration requirements very similar to those that\nSORNA later mandated. Brief for United States 18\u201329.\n   Congress enacted the Wetterling Act in 1994 and up-\ndated it several times prior to Kebodeaux\u2019s offense. Like\nSORNA, it used the federal spending power to encourage\nStates to adopt sex offender registration laws. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a714071(i) (2000 ed.); Smith, supra, at 89\u201390.             Like\nSORNA, it applied to those who committed federal sex\ncrimes. \u00a714071(b)(7)(A). And like SORNA, it imposed\nfederal penalties upon federal sex offenders who failed to\nregister in the States in which they lived, worked, and\nstudied. \u00a7\u00a714072(i)(3)\u2013(4).\n   In particular, \u00a714072(i)(3) imposed federal criminal\npenalties upon any \u201cperson who is . . . described in section\n4042(c)(4) of title 18, and knowingly fails to register in any\nState in which the person resides.\u201d The cross-referenced\n\u00a74042(c)(4) said that a \u201cperson is described in this para-\ngraph if the person was convicted of \u201d certain enumerated\noffenses or \u201c[a]ny other offense designated by the Attorney\nGeneral as a sexual offense for purposes of this subsec-\ntion.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a74042(c)(4). In 1998 the Attorney Gen-\neral \u201cdelegated this authority [to designate sex offenses] to\nthe Director of the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Prisons, Designation of Offenses Subject to Sex\nOffender Release Notification, 63 Fed. Reg. 69386. And\nthat same year the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n\u201cdesignate[d]\u201d the offense of which Kebodeaux was con-\nvicted, namely the military offense of \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d\nas set forth in Article 120(B) of the Code of Military Jus-\ntice. Id., at 69387 See 28 CFR \u00a7571.72(b)(2) (1999). A full\nreading of these documents makes clear that, contrary\nto Kebodeaux\u2019s contention, the relevant penalty applied to\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrimes committed by military personnel.\n   Moreover, a different Wetterling Act section imposed\nfederal criminal penalties upon any \u201cperson who is . . .\nsentenced by a court martial for conduct in a category\nspecified by the Secretary of Defense under section\n115(a)(8)(C) of title I of Public Law 105\u2013119, and know-\ningly fails to register in any State in which the person\nresides.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i)(4) (2000 ed.). The cross-\nreferenced section, \u00a7115(a)(8)(C), said that the \u201cSecretary\nof Defense shall specify categories of conduct punishable\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice which encom-\npass a range of conduct comparable to that described in\n[certain provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law\nEnforcement Act of 1994], and such other conduct as the\nSecretary deems appropriate.\u201d 1998 Appropriations Act,\n\u00a7115(a)(8)(C)(i), 111 Stat. 2466. See note following 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7951 (2000 ed.). The Secretary had delegated\ncertain types of authority, such as this last mentioned\n\u201cdeem[ing]\u201d authority, to an Assistant Secretary of De-\nfense. DoD Directive 5124.5, p. 4 (Oct. 31, 1994). And in\nDecember 1998 an Assistant Secretary, acting pursuant to\nthis authority, published a list of military crimes that\nincluded the crime of which Kebodeaux was convicted,\nnamely Article 120(B) of the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a\u2013175a. The provision\nadded that \u201c[c]onvictions . . . shall trigger requirements\nto notify state and local law enforcement agencies and to\nprovide information to inmates concerning sex offender\nregistration requirements.\u201d Id., at 175a. And, the provi-\nsion says (contrary to Kebodeaux\u2019s reading, Brief for\nRespondent 57), that it shall \u201ctake effect immediately.\u201d\nIt contains no expiration date. App. to Pet. for Cert. 175a.\n   We are not aware of any plausible counterargument to\nthe obvious conclusion, namely that as of the time of Kebo-\ndeaux\u2019s offense, conviction and release from federal\ncustody, these Wetterling Act provisions applied to Kebo-\n6              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeaux and imposed upon him registration requirements\nvery similar to those that SORNA later imposed. Con-\ntrary to what the Court of Appeals may have believed, the\nfact that the federal law\u2019s requirements in part involved\ncompliance with state-law requirements made them no\nless requirements of federal law. See generally United\nStates v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293\u2013294 (1958) (Con-\ngress has the power to adopt as federal law the laws of a\nState and to apply them in federal enclaves); Gibbons v.\nOgden, 9 Wheat. 1, 207\u2013208 (1824) (\u201cAlthough Congress\ncannot enable a State to legislate, Congress may adopt the\nprovisions of a State on any subject. . . . The act [adopts\nstate systems for regulation of pilots] and gives [them] the\nsame validity as if its provisions had been specially made\nby Congress\u201d).\n                             III\n  Both the Court of Appeals and Kebodeaux come close to\nconceding that if, as of the time of Kebodeaux\u2019s offense,\nhe was subject to a federal registration requirement, then\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause authorized Congress to\nmodify the requirement as in SORNA and to apply the\nmodified requirement to Kebodeaux. See 687 F. 3d, at\n234\u2013235, and n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339. And we believe\nthey would be right to make this concession.\n  No one here claims that the Wetterling Act, as applied\nto military sex offenders like Kebodeaux, falls outside the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause. And it is\ndifficult to see how anyone could persuasively do so. The\nConstitution explicitly grants Congress the power to\n\u201cmake Rules for the . . . Regulation of the land and naval\nForces.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14. And, in the Necessary and\nProper Clause itself, it grants Congress the power to\n\u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for\ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers\u201d and \u201call\nother Powers\u201d that the Constitution vests \u201cin the Govern-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nment of the United States, or in any Department or Officer\nthereof.\u201d Id., cl. 18.\n  The scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause is broad.\nIn words that have come to define that scope Chief Justice\nMarshall long ago wrote:\n    \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n    constitution, are constitutional.\u201d McCulloch v. Mary-\n    land, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).\nAs we have come to understand these words and the\nprovision they explain, they \u201cleav[e] to Congress a large\ndiscretion as to the means that may be employed in exe-\ncuting a given power.\u201d Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 355\n(1903). See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 607. The Clause al-\nlows Congress to \u201cadopt any means, appearing to it most\neligible and appropriate, which are adapted to the end to\nbe accomplished and consistent with the letter and spirit\nof the Constitution.\u201d James Everard\u2019s Breweries v. Day,\n265 U. S. 545, 559 (1924).\n   The Constitution, for example, makes few explicit refer-\nences to federal criminal law, but the Necessary and\nProper Clause nonetheless authorizes Congress, in the im-\nplementation of other explicit powers, to create federal\ncrimes, to confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and\nother prison personnel, to provide prisoners with medical\ncare and educational training, to ensure the safety of those\nwho may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the\npublic\u2019s safety through systems of parole and supervised\nrelease, and, where a federal prisoner\u2019s mental condition\nso requires, to confine that prisoner civilly after the expi-\nration of his or her term of imprisonment. See United\nStates v. Comstock, 560 U. S. 126, 136\u2013137 (2010).\n   Here, under the authority granted to it by the Military\n8              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRegulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses, Congress\ncould promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It\ncould specify that the sex offense of which Kebodeaux was\nconvicted was a military crime under that Code. It could\npunish that crime through imprisonment and by placing\nconditions upon Kebodeaux\u2019s release. And it could make\nthe civil registration requirement at issue here a conse-\nquence of Kebodeaux\u2019s offense and conviction. This civil\nrequirement, while not a specific condition of Kebodeaux\u2019s\nrelease, was in place at the time Kebodeaux committed his\noffense, and was a consequence of his violation of federal\nlaw.\n  And Congress\u2019 decision to impose such a civil require-\nment that would apply upon the release of an offender like\nKebodeaux is eminently reasonable. Congress could rea-\nsonably conclude that registration requirements applied to\nfederal sex offenders after their release can help protect\nthe public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate\npublic safety concerns. See Smith, 538 U. S., at 102\u2013103\n(sex offender registration has \u201ca legitimate nonpunitive\npurpose of \u2018public safety, which is advanced by alerting the\npublic to the risk of sex offenders in their community\u2019 \u201d).\nThere is evidence that recidivism rates among sex offend-\ners are higher than the average for other types of crimi-\nnals. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nP. Langan, E. Schmitt, & M. Durose, Recidivism of Sex\nOffenders Released in 1994, p. 1 (Nov. 2003) (reporting\nthat compared to non-sex offenders, released sex offenders\nwere four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex\ncrime, and that within the first three years following\nrelease 5.3% of released sex offenders were rearrested for\na sex crime). There is also conflicting evidence on the\npoint. Cf. R. Tewsbury, W. Jennings, & K. Zgoba, Final\nReport on Sex Offenders: Recidivism and Collateral Con-\nsequences (Sept. 2011) (concluding that sex offenders have\nrelatively low rates of recidivism, and that registration\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But the Clause gives Congress the power to\nweigh the evidence and to reach a rational conclusion, for\nexample, that safety needs justify postrelease registration\nrules. See Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U. S. 581, 594\u2013\n595 (1926) (upholding congressional statute limiting the\namount of spirituous liquor that may be prescribed by\na physician, and noting that Congress\u2019 \u201cfinding [regard-\ning the appropriate amount], in the presence of the well-\nknown diverging opinions of physicians, cannot be regarded\nas arbitrary or without a reasonable basis\u201d). See also\nGonzales v. Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 22 (2005) (\u201cIn assessing the\nscope of Congress\u2019 authority under the Commerce Clause,\nwe stress that the task before us is a modest one.

United States, 560 U. S. 438, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 12). The Federal Government has long kept track\nof former federal prisoners through probation, parole, and\nsupervised release in part to prevent further crimes there-\nby protecting the public against the risk of recidivism. See\nParole Act, 36 Stat. 819; Probation Act, ch. 521, 43 Stat.\n1259; Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, ch. II, 98 Stat. 1987.\nSee also 1 N. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole\n\u00a7\u00a77:3, 7:4 (2d ed. 1999) (principal purposes of postrelease\nconditions are to rehabilitate the convict, thus preventing\n10             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhim from recidivating, and to protect the public). Neither,\nas of 1994, was registration particularly novel, for by then\nStates had implemented similar requirements for close to\nhalf a century. See W. Logan, Knowledge as Power: Crim-\ninal Registration and Community Notification Laws in\nAmerica 30\u201331 (2009). Moreover, the Wetterling Act took\nstate interests into account by, for the most part, requiring\nreleased federal offenders to register in accordance with\nstate law. At the same time, the Wetterling Act\u2019s re-\nquirements were reasonably narrow and precise, tying\ntime limits to the type of sex offense, incorporating state-\nlaw details, and relating penalties for violations to the\nsex crime initially at issue. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a714071(b)\n(2000 ed.).\n   The upshot is that here Congress did not apply SORNA\nto an individual who had, prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment,\nbeen \u201cunconditionally released,\u201d i.e., a person who was not\nin \u201cany . . . special relationship with the federal govern-\nment,\u201d but rather to an individual already subject to fed-\neral registration requirements that were themselves a\nvalid exercise of federal power under the Military Regula-\ntion and Necessary and Proper Clauses. But cf. post, at 1\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   SORNA, enacted after Kebodeaux\u2019s release, somewhat\nmodified the applicable registration requirements. In gen-\neral, SORNA provided more detailed definitions of sex\noffenses, described in greater detail the nature of the\ninformation registrants must provide, and imposed some-\nwhat different limits upon the length of time that regis-\ntration must continue and the frequency with which\noffenders must update their registration. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a716911,\n16913\u201316916 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). But the statute, like\nthe Wetterling Act, used Spending Clause grants to en-\ncourage States to adopt its uniform definitions and re-\nquirements. It did not insist that the States do so. See\n\u00a7\u00a716925(a), (d) (2006 ed.) (\u201cThe provisions of this subchap-\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Compare 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716913(c) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\u2013168a.\nSORNA also increased the federal penalty for a federal\noffender\u2019s registration violation to a maximum of 10 years\nfrom a maximum of 1 year for a first offense. Compare\n18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i) (2000\ned.). Kebodeaux was sentenced to one year and one day\nof imprisonment. For purposes of federal law, SORNA re-\nduced the duration of Kebodeaux\u2019s registration require-\nment to 25 years from the lifetime requirement imposed\nby Texas law, compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716915(a) (2006 ed.)\nwith App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a, and reduced the frequency\nwith which Kebodeaux must update his registration to\nevery six months from every 90 days as imposed by Texas\nlaw, compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716916(2) with App. to Pet. for\nCert. 167a. And as far as we can tell, while SORNA pun-\nishes violations of its requirements (instead of violations of\nstate law), the Federal Government has prosecuted a sex\noffender for violating SORNA only when that offender also\nviolated state-registration requirements.\n  SORNA\u2019s general changes were designed to make more\nuniform what had remained \u201ca patchwork of federal and\n50 individual state registration systems,\u201d Reynolds v.\nUnited States, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 2),\nwith \u201cloopholes and deficiencies\u201d that had resulted in an\nestimated 100,000 sex offenders becoming \u201cmissing\u201d or\n12             UNITED STATES v.

SORNA\u2019s more\nspecific changes reflect Congress\u2019 determination that the\nstatute, changed in respect to frequency, penalties, and\nother details, will keep track of more offenders and will\nencourage States themselves to adopt its uniform stand-\nards. No one here claims that these changes are unrea-\nsonable or that Congress could not reasonably have found\nthem \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means for furthering its pre-\nexisting registration ends.\n   We conclude that the SORNA changes as applied to\nKebodeaux fall within the scope Congress\u2019 authority under\nthe Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment to the contrary is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

ANTHONY JAMES\n                 KEBODEAUX\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                         [June 24, 2013]\n\n   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, concurring in the judgment.\n   I agree with the Court that Congress had the power,\nunder the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper\nClauses of Article I, to require Anthony Kebodeaux to\nregister as a sex offender. The majority, having estab-\nlished that premise and thus resolved the case before us,\nnevertheless goes on to discuss the general public safety\nbenefits of the registration requirement. Ante, at 8\u201310.\nBecause that analysis is beside the point in this case, I con-\ncur in the judgment only.\n   While serving in the Air Force, Kebodeaux violated the\nUniform Code of Military Justice by having sexual rela-\ntions with a minor. A special court-martial convicted him.\nAs relevant here, that conviction had two consequences:\nFirst, Kebodeaux was sentenced to confinement for three\nmonths. And second, as the majority describes, he was\nrequired to register as a sex offender with the State in\nwhich he resided and keep that registration current; fail-\nure to do so would subject him to federal criminal penal-\nties. Ante, at 4\u20136.\n   In the same way that Congress undoubtedly had the au-\nthority to impose the first consequence for a violation of\nmilitary rules, it also had the authority to impose the\nsecond. The Constitution gives Congress the power \u201c[t]o\nmake Rules for the Government and Regulation of the\n2             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nland and naval Forces.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14. And, under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can give those\nrules force by imposing consequences on members of the\nmilitary who disobey them. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316, 416 (1819) (\u201cAll admit that the government\nmay, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and\nyet, this is not among the enumerated powers of Con-\ngress.\u201d). A servicemember will be less likely to violate a\nrelevant military regulation if he knows that, having done\nso, he will be required to register as a sex offender years\ninto the future.\n   It is this power, the power to regulate the conduct of\nmembers of the military by imposing consequences for\ntheir violations of military law, that supports application\nof the federal registration obligation to Kebodeaux. As the\nCourt explains, the Wetterling Act was in force when\nKebodeaux committed the original offense, and applied to\nhim as soon as the special court-martial rendered its\nverdict. See ante, at 5\u20136. Congress later, in enacting the\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA),\nmodified the registration regime in place under the Wet-\nterling Act. But as applied to Kebodeaux here (the rele-\nvant inquiry in this as-applied challenge), those changes\nwere insignificant; their only effect was that Kebodeaux\nreceived a day more than he could have received for the\nsame conduct had the Wetterling Act remained in force.\nSee ante, at 11 (describing SORNA\u2019s effect on Kebodeaux\u2019s\nregistration obligations); compare post, at 10, n. 3\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (discussing changes that did not\naffect Kebodeaux). Whatever other constitutional con-\ncerns might attach to such a change, as a question of\nArticle I power it was permissible. Just as the Federal\nGovernment may, under the Necessary and Proper\nClause, alter the conditions of a federal prisoner\u2019s con-\nfinement or adjust the timing and location of drug\ntests required of a federal convict, so too could it make\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

J., concurring in judgment\n\nslight modifications to a previously imposed registration\nobligation.\n   The majority says, more or less, the same thing. Ante,\nat 8, 11\u201312. But sandwiched between its discussion of the\nbasis for Congress\u2019s power and its discussion of the incon-\nsequential nature of the changes is a discussion of benefits\nfrom the registration system. Along with giving force to\nmilitary regulations, the majority notes, Congress could\nalso have \u201creasonably conclude[d] that registration re-\nquirements . . . help protect the public from . . . federal sex\noffenders and alleviate public safety concerns.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n   Maybe so, but those consequences of the registration\nrequirement are irrelevant for our purposes. Public safety\nbenefits are neither necessary nor sufficient to a proper\nexercise of the power to regulate the military. What\nmatters\u2014all that matters\u2014is that Congress could have\nrationally determined that \u201cmak[ing] the civil registration\nrequirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux\u2019s\noffense\u201d would give force to the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice adopted pursuant to Congress\u2019s power to regulate\nthe Armed Forces. Ibid.\n   Ordinarily such surplusage might not warrant a sepa-\nrate writing. Here, however, I worry that incautious\nreaders will think they have found in the majority opinion\nsomething they would not find in either the Constitution\nor any prior decision of ours: a federal police power. The\ndanger of such confusion is heightened by the fact the\nSolicitor General adopted something very close to the\npolice power argument, contending that \u201cthe federal gov-\nernment has greater ties to former federal sex offenders\nthan it does to other members of the general public,\u201d and\ncan therefore impose restrictions on them even years after\ntheir unconditional release simply to \u201cserve[ ] . . . public-\nprotection purposes.\u201d Brief for United States 34\u201335.\n   I write separately to stress not only that a federal police\npower is immaterial to the result in this case, but also that\n4             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuch a power could not be material to the result in this\ncase\u2014because it does not exist. See United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618\u2013619 (2000) (\u201c \u2018[W]e always\nhave rejected readings of . . . the scope of federal power\nthat would permit Congress to exercise a police power\u2019 \u201d\n(quoting United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 584\u2013585\n(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring))).\n   Our resistance to congressional assertions of such a\npower has deep roots. From the first, we have recognized\nthat \u201cthe powers of the government are limited, and that\nits limits are not to be transcended.\u201d McCulloch, 4\nWheat., at 420\u2013421. Thus, while the Necessary and\nProper Clause authorizes congressional action \u201cincidental\nto [an enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial\nexercise,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall was emphatic that no\n\u201cgreat substantive and independent power\u201d can be \u201cim-\nplied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of\nexecuting them.\u201d Id., at 418, 411; see also Gibbons v.\nOgden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824) (\u201cThe enumeration presup-\nposes something not enumerated\u201d).\n   It is difficult to imagine a clearer example of such a\n\u201cgreat substantive and independent power\u201d than the\npower to \u201chelp protect the public . . . and alleviate pub-\nlic safety concerns,\u201d ante, at 8. I find it implausible to\nsuppose\u2014and impossible to support\u2014that the Framers in-\ntended to confer such authority by implication rather than\nexpression. A power of that magnitude vested in the\nFederal Government is not \u201cconsist[ent] with the letter\nand spirit of the constitution,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 421,\nand thus not a \u201cproper [means] for carrying into Execu-\ntion\u201d the enumerated powers of the Federal Government,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. See United States v. Com-\nstock, 560 U. S. 126, 153 (2010) (KENNEDY, J., concurring\nin judgment) (\u201cIt is of fundamental importance to consider\nwhether essential attributes of state sovereignty are com-\npromised by the assertion of federal power under the\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

J., concurring in judgment\n\nNecessary and Proper Clause\u201d).\n  It makes no difference that the Federal Government\nwould be policing people previously convicted of a federal\ncrime\u2014even a federal sex crime. The fact of a prior fed-\neral conviction, by itself, does not give Congress a freestand-\ning, independent, and perpetual interest in protecting the\npublic from the convict\u2019s purely intrastate conduct.\n  But as I have said, I do not understand the majority\u2019s\nopinion to be based on such a power. The connection to\nthe Military Regulation Clause on which the majority\nrelies, ante, at 8, is less attenuated, and the power it\nproduces less substantial, than would be true of a federal\npolice power over prior federal offenders; the power to\nthreaten and impose particular obligations as a result of a\nviolation of military law is not such a \u201cgreat substantive\nand independent power\u201d that the Framers\u2019 failure to enu-\nmerate it must imply its absence.\n  Nevertheless, I fear that the majority\u2019s discussion of the\npublic-safety benefits of the registration requirement will\nbe mistaken for an endorsement of the Solicitor General\u2019s\npublic-safety basis for the law. I accordingly concur in the\njudgment only.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

Exercising this power,\nCongress has enacted provisions of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) that authorize members of the\nmilitary to be tried before a military tribunal, rather than\na state court, for ordinary criminal offenses, including sex\ncrimes, that are committed both within and outside the\nboundaries of a military installation. See, e.g., UCMJ Art.\n2 (persons subject to UCMJ); Art. 5 (\u201cThis chapter applies\nin all places\u201d); Art. 120 (rape by a person subject to\nUCMJ); Solorio v. United States, 483 U.

For example, if the service-\nmember is convicted of a sex offense in a state court, the\nstate court may be required by state law to provide that\ninformation to the state registry. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u201322\u2013104(1)(a)(I) (2012). State law may also\nrequire the state corrections department to notify both\nstate and local police of the offender\u2019s release.

Because the exercise of military jurisdiction\nmay have this effect\u2014in other words, may create a gap in\nthe laws intended to maximize the registration of sex\noffenders\u2014it is necessary and proper for Congress to\nrequire the registration of members of the military who\nare convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military\ncourt. When Congress, in validly exercising a power ex-\npressly conferred by the Constitution, creates or exacer-\nbates a dangerous situation (here, the possibility that a\nconvicted sex offender may escape registration), Congress\nhas the power to try to eliminate or at least diminish that\ndanger.

S. C. \u00a716901 et seq., for failing to update his sex of-\nfender registration when he moved from one Texas city to\nanother. The Court today holds that Congress has power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact SORNA\nand criminalize Kebodeaux\u2019s failure to update his registra-\ntion. I disagree. As applied to Kebodeaux, SORNA does\nnot \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d any of the federal powers enu-\nmerated in the Constitution. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Rather,\nit usurps the general police power vested in the States.\nBecause SORNA\u2019s registration requirements are unconsti-\ntutional as applied to Kebodeaux, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted SORNA in 2006. SORNA requires\nthat every \u201csex offender shall register, and keep the regis-\ntration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender\nresides, where the offender is an employee, and where the\noffender is a student.\u201d 42 U.

As relevant here, SORNA makes it a federal\ncrime when someone who is required to register as a sex\noffender \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a regis-\ntration\u201d and that person \u201cis a sex offender [as defined\nby SORNA] by reason of a conviction under Federal\nlaw (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72250(a)(2)(A), (3).\n  In March 1999, Anthony Kebodeaux had consensual sex\nwith a 15-year-old girl when he was a 20-year-old Air-\nman in the U. S. Air Force. He was convicted by a court-\nmartial of carnal knowledge of a female under the age\nof 16, in violation of Article 120(b) of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ). He was sentenced to three\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment and received a bad-conduct dis-\ncharge. He completed his sentence in September 1999 and\nwas no longer in federal custody or the military when\nCongress enacted SORNA, which required him to register\nas a sex offender. In 2007, Kebodeaux failed to update his\nsex-offender registration within three days of moving from\nEl Paso, Texas, to San Antonio, Texas. He was convicted\nunder \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) in 2008 and sentenced to a year and\na day in prison. The question before the Court is whether\nCongress has power to require Kebodeaux to register as a\nsex offender and to criminalize his failure to do so.\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The Constitution creates a Federal Government with\nlimited powers. Congress has no powers except those\nspecified in the Constitution. See Marbury v. Madison,\n1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (\u201cThe powers of\nthe legislature are defined, and limited; and that those\nlimits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nis written\u201d). Thus, \u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must\nbe based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the\nConstitution.\u201d United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n607 (2000).\n   A different default rule applies to the States. As the\nTenth Amendment makes clear, the States enjoy all pow-\ners that the Constitution does not withhold from them.\n(\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d) While\nthe powers of Congress are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d the powers\nthat \u201cremain in the State governments are numerous and\nindefinite.\u201d The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed.\n1961) (J. Madison).\n   The Constitution sets forth Congress\u2019 limited powers in\nArticle I. That Article begins by \u201cvest[ing]\u201d in Congress\n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d and then enu-\nmerates those powers in \u00a78. The final clause of \u00a78, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, gives Congress power \u201c[t]o\nmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for\ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other\nPowers vested by this Constitution in the Government\nof the United States, or in any Department or Officer\nthereof.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Importantly, the Necessary and\nProper Clause is not a freestanding grant of congressional\npower, but rather an authorization to makes laws that are\nnecessary to execute both the powers vested in Congress\nby the preceding clauses of \u00a78, and the powers vested in\nCongress and the other branches by other provisions of the\nConstitution. See, e.g., Kinsella v. United States ex rel.\nSingleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960) (\u201cThe [Necessary and\nProper Clause] is not itself a grant of power, but a caveat\nthat the Congress possesses all the means necessary to\ncarry out the specifically granted \u2018foregoing\u2019 powers of \u00a78\n\u2018and all other Powers vested by this Constitution\u2019 \u201d).\n   In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), Chief\n4               UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nJustice Marshall famously set forth the Court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the Necessary and Proper Clause:\n    \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist[ent] with the letter and spirit\n    of the constitution, are constitutional.\u201d Id., at 421.\nUnder this formulation, a federal law is a valid exercise of\nCongress\u2019 power under the Clause if it satisfies a two-part\ntest. \u201cFirst, the law must be directed toward a \u2018legitimate\u2019\nend, which McCulloch defines as one \u2018within the scope of\nthe [C]onstitution.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Comstock, 560\nU. S. 126, 160 (2010) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting 4\nWheat., at 421). In other words, the law must be directed\nat \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d one or more of the powers\ndelegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution.\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. \u201cSecond, there must be a necessary and\nproper fit between the \u2018means\u2019 (the federal law) and the\n\u2018end\u2019 (the enumerated power or powers) it is designed to\nserve.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 160 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning). \u201cThe means Congress selects will be deemed \u2018neces-\nsary\u2019 if they are \u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018plainly adapted\u2019 to the\nexercise of an enumerated power, and \u2018proper\u2019 if they are\nnot otherwise \u2018prohibited\u2019 by the Constitution and not\n\u2018[in]consistent\u2019 with its \u2018letter and spirit.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 160\u2013161\n(quoting Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18 and McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n421).\n   Both parts of this test are critical. \u201c[N]o matter how\n\u2018necessary\u2019 or \u2018proper\u2019 an Act of Congress may be to its\nobjective, Congress lacks authority to legislate if the objec-\ntive is anything other than \u2018carrying into Execution\u2019 one or\nmore of the Federal Government\u2019s enumerated powers.\u201d\nComstock, supra, at 161 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As\napplied to Kebodeaux, SORNA fails this test.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   It is undisputed that no enumerated power in Article I,\n\u00a78, gives Congress the power to punish sex offenders who\nfail to register, nor does any other provision in the Consti-\ntution vest Congress or the other branches of the Federal\nGovernment with such a power. Thus, SORNA is a valid\nexercise of congressional authority only if it is \u201cnecessary\nand proper for carrying into Execution\u201d one or more of\nthose federal powers enumerated in the Constitution.\n   In the course of this litigation, the Government has\nargued that Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction under \u00a72250(a)(2)(A)\nexecutes Congress\u2019 enumerated powers to spend for the gen-\neral welfare, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1; to regulate interstate com-\nmerce, \u00a78, cl. 3; and to regulate the armed forces, \u00a78,\ncl. 14. But none of these powers justifies applying\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) to Kebodeaux. The Spending Clause ar-\ngument is a nonstarter. Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not\nexecute Congress\u2019 spending power because it regulates\nindividuals who have not necessarily received federal funds\nof any kind. The Government contends that \u201cfederal fund-\ning and logistical support offered to States for their sex-\noffender-registration-and-notification programs can be\neffective only if persons required to register actually do so\u201d\nand that \u201cCongress may impose penalties on such individ-\nuals as a means of achieving that goal.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 52. But we have never held that Congress gains\nthe power to regulate private individuals merely because\nit provides money to the States in which they reside.\n   Nor does the Commerce Clause\u2014the enumerated power\nthat the Court has construed most broadly\u2014support\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A). Under this Court\u2019s precedents, Congress\nmay use its Commerce Clause power to regulate (1) \u201c \u2018the\nuse of the channels of interstate commerce,\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c \u2018the\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or\nthings in interstate commerce,\u2019 \u201d and (3) economic activi-\nties that \u201c \u2018substantially affect interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d\n6              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558\u2013559 (1995); see\nalso Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617. Section 2250(a)(2)(A)\ndoes not fall within the first two categories because it is\nnot limited to regulating sex offenders who have traveled\nin interstate commerce. Instead, it applies to all federal\nsex offenders who fail to register, even if they never cross\nstate lines. Nor does \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) fall within the third\ncategory. Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity,\nsuch as sex crimes, based on the effect it might have on\ninterstate commerce. Cf. Morrison, supra, at 617. (\u201cWe . . .\nreject the argument that Congress may regulate noneco-\nnomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that con-\nduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce\u201d). In short,\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) regulates activity that is neither \u201c \u2018inter-\nstate\u2019 \u201d nor \u201c \u2018commercial,\u2019 \u201d 687 F. 3d 232, 253 (CA5 2012),\nand, thus, it cannot be justified on the ground that it\nexecutes Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce.\n  Finally, Congress\u2019 power \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Gov-\nernment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\u201d\ndoes not support Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction under \u00a72250(a)\n(2)(A). Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14. Kebodeaux had long since\nfully served his criminal sentence for violating Article\n120(b) of the UCMJ and was no longer in the military\nwhen Congress enacted SORNA. Congress does not retain\na general police power over every person who has ever\nserved in the military. See United States ex rel. Toth v.\nQuarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955) (\u201cIt has never been inti-\nmated by this Court . . . that Article I military jurisdiction\ncould be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who had severed\nall relationship with the military and its institutions. . . .\n[G]iven its natural meaning, the power granted Congress\n\u2018To make Rules\u2019 to regulate \u2018the land and naval Forces\u2019\nwould seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to per-\nsons who are actually members or part of the armed\nforces\u201d).

It begins\nby explaining that \u201cat the time of his offense Kebodeaux\nwas subject to the federal Wetterling Act, an Act that\nimposed upon him registration requirements very similar\nto those that SORNA later mandated.\u201d3 Ante, at 4. But\nthat is beside the point. Kebodeaux was convicted of\nviolating SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, not the\nWetterling Act\u2019s, and so the relevant question is what\nenumerated power SORNA \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution.\u201d\n\u201cThe Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Con-\ngress with authority to enact any law simply because it\nfurthers other laws Congress has enacted in the exercise\nof its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires\na showing that every federal statute \u2018carr[ies] into\nExecution\u2019 one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enu-\nmerated powers.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 168 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting).\n   Nevertheless, apparently in an effort to bootstrap the\nWetterling Act, the Court proceeds to determine whether\nthe Wetterling Act (not SORNA) falls within Congress\u2019\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrongly asserts that the differences between the\n\nWetterling Act and SORNA are \u201cinsignificant.\u201d Ante, at 2 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment). SORNA increases the federal penalty for fail-\ning to register from a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one\nyear to a felony punishable by up to 10 years for a first offense. Com-\npare 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i) (2000 ed.). It is\nsimply incorrect to minimize that change by saying that Kebodeaux\nreceived only a day more than he could have received for failing to\nregister under the Wetterling Act. Ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concur-\nring in judgment). The \u201clegally prescribed range is the penalty affixed\nto the crime,\u201d Alleyne v. United States, ante, at 11, and SORNA in-\ncreased that range significantly. SORNA also requires that a sex\noffender who moves update his registration within three days of mov-\ning, instead of seven. Compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(c) with App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 167a\u2013168a. Thus, a person can be convicted under SORNA for\nconduct that would have complied with the Wetterling Act.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court\nfirst notes that the Clause \u201c \u2018leave[s] to Congress a large\ndiscretion as to the means that may be employed in exe-\ncuting a given power,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 7 (quoting Lottery Case,\n188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903))\u2014a fact that is entirely irrele-\nvant under McCulloch\u2019s first step of determining whether\nthe end is itself legitimate. The Court then observes that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause\n    \u201cauthorizes Congress, in the implementation of other\n    explicit powers, to create federal crimes, to confine of-\n    fenders to prison, to hire guards and other prison per-\n    sonnel, to provide prisoners with medical care and\n    educational training, to ensure the safety of those who\n    may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the\n    public\u2019s safety through systems of parole and super-\n    vised release, and, where a federal prisoner\u2019s mental\n    condition so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly\n    after the expiration of his or her term of imprison-\n    ment.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nFrom these powers, the Court reasons that the Wetterling\nAct is valid because \u201cCongress could reasonably conclude\nthat registration requirements applied to federal sex\noffenders after their release can help protect the public\nfrom those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety\nconcerns.\u201d Ante, at 8. As I explained in Comstock, how-\never, this mode of analysis confuses the inquiry. 560 U. S.\nat 168\u2013169 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). \u201cFederal laws that\ncriminalize conduct . . . , establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence\u201d are only valid if they \u201c \u2018Execut[e]\u2019 \u201d an enumer-\nated power. Id., at 169. Here, for example, Congress has\nauthority to enact Article 120(b) of the UCMJ, to enforce\nthat provision against military personnel who violate it,\nand to confine them in a military prison while they are\n12             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nawaiting trial and serving a sentence. All of those actions\n\u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d Congress\u2019 power to promote order\nand discipline within the military by regulating the con-\nduct of military personnel. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14.\n    But the enumerated power that justified Kebodeaux\u2019s\nconviction does not justify requiring him to register as a\nsex offender now that he is a civilian. If Kebodeaux were\nrequired to register as part of his criminal sentence, then\nregistration would help execute the power that justifies\nhis conviction. The court-martial here, however, did not\nimpose registration requirements at Kebodeaux\u2019s sentenc-\ning. See ante, at 8 (acknowledging that registration is a\n\u201ccivil requirement\u201d and was \u201cnot a specific condition of\nKebodeaux\u2019s release\u201d). Enacted long after Kebodeaux had\ncompleted his sentence, SORNA cannot be justified as a\npunishment for the offense Kebodeaux committed while in\nthe military because retroactively increasing his punish-\nment would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See Peugh\nv. United States, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8)\n(explaining that laws that \u201c \u2018inflic[t] a greater punishment\n. . . than the law annexed to the crime . . . when commit-\nted\u2019 \u201d violate the Ex Post Facto Clause) (quoting Calder v.\nBull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)); Peugh, supra, at ___\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (explaining that\n\u201claws retroactively increasing the punishment were . . .\nunderstood to be ex post facto at the time of the found-\ning\u201d).

See\nArt. VI, cl. 2. \u201cAs long as it is acting within the powers\ngranted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose\nits will on the States.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that Congress has authority to impose\n\nregistration as a consequence of Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction because \u201c[a]\nservicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regula-\ntion if he knows that, having done so, he will be required to register as\na sex offender years into the future.\u201d Ante, at 2. But SORNA could not\npossibly have deterred Kebodeaux from violating any military regula-\ntion because it was enacted after he left the military.\n   JUSTICE ALITO contends that, by trying members of the military in a\nmilitary court, Congress exacerbated \u201cthe possibility that a convicted\nsex offender may escape [the state] registration [system],\u201d and that\nSORNA is necessary and proper to correct this problem. Ante, at 3\n(opinion concurring in judgment). But JUSTICE ALITO has not identified\nany enumerated power that gives Congress authority to address this\nsupposed problem, and there is no evidence that such a problem exists.\nIndeed, Texas has indicated that SORNA undermines its registration\nsystem, rather than making it more effective. See Letter from Jeffrey\nS. Boyd, General Counsel and Acting Chief of Staff, Texas Office of the\nGovernor, to Linda Baldwin, Director, SMART Office 1 (Aug. 17, 2011)\n(\u201cAlthough we in Texas certainly appreciate and agree with the stated\ngoals of SORNA, the adoption of this \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 federal legisla-\ntion in Texas would in fact undermine the accomplishment of those\nobjectives in Texas, just as it would in most other states\u201d), online\nat http: // www.ncleg.net / documentsites / committees / JLOCJPS / October%\n2013,%202011%20Meeting / RD_SORNA_General_Information_2011-10-\n13.pdf (as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).\n14             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n460 (1991). The fact that the Wetterling Act and SORNA\nmay be \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201c[take] state interests into account,\u201d\nante, at 10, is \u201cnot a matter of constitutional necessity, but\nan act of legislative grace.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 178\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). These factors have no place in\ndeciding whether a law \u201cExecut[es]\u201d an enumerated power.\n                              B\n   The Court not only ignores the limitations on Congress\u2019\npower set forth in the Constitution, but it also ignores the\nlimits that it marked just three years ago in Comstock. In\nthat case, this Court held that Congress has power under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause to enact 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a74248, which authorizes the Federal Government to civilly\ncommit \u201csexually dangerous persons\u201d beyond the date it\nlawfully could hold them on a charge or conviction for a\nfederal crime. Comstock, 560 U. S., at 142. The Court\nrebuffed the assertion that it was conferring a general\npolice power on Congress by asserting that \u00a74248 was\n\u201climited to individuals already \u2018in the custody of the\u2019 Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Id., at 148. The Solicitor General even\nconceded at oral argument that \u201cthe Federal Government\nwould not have . . . the power to commit a person who . . .\nhas been released from prison and whose period of super-\nvised release is also completed\u201d because \u201cat that point the\nState police power over a person has been fully reestab-\nlished.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Comstock O. T.\n2009, No. 08\u20131224, p. 9. The Court and the Government\ntoday abandon even that meager restriction, which itself\nlies far beyond the constitutional limits. Kebodeaux was\nno longer in federal custody when Congress enacted\nSORNA, yet the Court disregards the fact that, even\nunder Comstock, release from prison and supervised re-\nlease terminates any hold the Federal Government might\notherwise have and \u201cfully reestablishe[d]\u201d the State\u2019s\npolice power over that individual.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

KEBODEAUX\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013418.      Argued April 17, 2013\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nRespondent Kebodeaux was convicted by a special court-martial of a\n  federal sex offense. After serving his sentence and receiving a bad\n  conduct discharge from the Air Force, he moved to Texas where he\n  registered with state authorities as a sex offender. Congress subse-\n  quently enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\n  (SORNA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the\n  States where they live, study, and work, 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(a), and\n  which applies to offenders who, when SORNA became law, had al-\n  ready completed their sentences, 28 CFR \u00a772.3. When Kebodeaux\n  moved within Texas and failed to update his registration, the Federal\n  Government prosecuted him under SORNA, and the District Court\n  convicted him. The Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that, at the time of\n  SORNA\u2019s enactment, Kebodeaux had served his sentence and was no\n  longer in any special relationship with the Federal Government. Be-\n  lieving that Kebodeaux was not required to register under the pre-\n  SORNA Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Vio-\n  lent Offender Registration Act, the court found that he had been \u201cun-\n  conditionally\u201d freed. That being so, the court held, the Federal Gov-\n  ernment lacked the power under Article I\u2019s Necessary and Proper\n  Clause to regulate his intrastate movements.\nHeld: SORNA\u2019s registration requirements as applied to Kebodeaux fall\n within the scope of Congress\u2019 authority under the Necessary and\n Proper Clause. Pp. 3\u201312.\n    (a) Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s critical assumption that Ke-\n bodeaux\u2019s release was unconditional, a full reading of the relevant\n statutes and regulations makes clear that at the time of his offense\n and conviction he was subject to the Wetterling Act, which imposed\n upon him registration requirements very similar to SORNA\u2019s. See,\n2                   UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    e.g., 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a714072(i)(3)\u2013(4). The fact that these federal-law re-\n    quirements in part involved compliance with state-law requirements\n    made them no less requirements of federal law. See generally United\n    States v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293\u2013294. Pp. 3\u20136.\n       (b) Congress promulgated the Wetterling Act under authority\n    granted by the Military Regulation Clause, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14, and the\n    Necessary and Proper Clause. The same power that authorized Con-\n    gress to promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and punish\n    Kebodeaux\u2019s crime also authorized Congress to make the civil regis-\n    tration requirement at issue here a consequence of his conviction.\n    And its decision to impose a civil registration requirement that would\n    apply upon the release of an offender like Kebodeaux is eminently\n    reasonable. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 102\u2013103. It was also en-\n    tirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special role to the\n    Federal Government in ensuring compliance with federal sex offend-\n    er registration requirements. See Carr v. United States, 560 U. S.\n    438, ___. Thus, Congress did not apply SORNA to an individual who\n    had, prior to its enactment, been \u201cunconditionally released,\u201d but ra-\n    ther to an individual already subject to federal registration require-\n    ments enacted pursuant to the Military Regulation and Necessary\n    and Proper Clauses. SORNA somewhat modified the applicable reg-\n    istration requirements to which Kebodeaux was already subject, in\n    order to make more uniform what had remained \u201ca patchwork of fed-\n    eral and 50 individual state registration requirements,\u201d Reynolds v.\n    United States, 565 U. S. ___, ___. No one here claims that these\n    changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have\n    found them \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d means for furthering its pre-\n    existing registration ends.

ANTHONY JAMES\n                 KEBODEAUX\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                [June 24, 2013]\n\n   JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   In 1999 a special court-martial convicted Anthony Kebo-\ndeaux, a member of the United States Air Force, of a sex\noffense. It imposed a sentence of three months\u2019 imprison-\nment and a bad conduct discharge. In 2006, several years\nafter Kebodeaux had served his sentence and been dis-\ncharged, Congress enacted the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716901 et seq., a federal statute that requires those con-\nvicted of federal sex offenses to register in the States\nwhere they live, study, and work. \u00a716913(a); 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a72250(a). And, by regulation, the Federal Government\nmade clear that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements ap-\nply to federal sex offenders who, when SORNA became\nlaw, had already completed their sentences. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a716913(d) (Attorney General\u2019s authority to issue regula-\ntions); 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2012) (regulation specifying applica-\ntion to pre-SORNA offenders).\n   We here must decide whether the Constitution\u2019s Neces-\nsary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power to\nenact SORNA\u2019s registration requirements and apply them\n2             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\nto a federal offender who had completed his sentence prior\nto the time of SORNA\u2019s enactment. For purposes of an-\nswering this question, we assume that Congress has com-\nplied with the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto and Due\nProcess Clauses. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U. S. 84, 105\u2013106\n(2003) (upholding a similar Alaska statute against ex post\nfacto challenge); Supp. Brief for Kebodeaux on Rehearing\nEn Banc in No. 08\u201351185 (CA5) (not raising any Due\nProcess challenge); Brief for Respondent (same). We\nconclude that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants\nCongress adequate power to enact SORNA and to apply\nit here.\n                             I\n   As we have just said, in 1999 a special court-martial\nconvicted Kebodeaux, then a member of the Air Force, of a\nfederal sex offense. He served his 3-month sentence; the\nAir Force released him with a bad conduct discharge. And\nthen he moved to Texas. In 2004 Kebodeaux registered\nas a sex offender with Texas state authorities. Brief for\nRespondent 6\u20137. In 2006 Congress enacted SORNA. In\n2007 Kebodeaux moved within Texas from San Antonio to\nEl Paso, updating his sex offender registration. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 167a\u2013168a. But later that year he returned\nto San Antonio without making the legally required sex-\noffender registration changes. Id., at 169a. And the Fed-\neral Government, acting under SORNA, prosecuted\nKebodeaux for this last-mentioned SORNA registration\nfailure.\n   A Federal District Court convicted Kebodeaux of having\nviolated SORNA. See 687 F. 3d 232, 234 (CA5 2012) (en\nbanc). On appeal a panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit initially upheld the convic-\ntion. 647 F. 3d 137 (2011) (per curiam). But the Circuit\nthen heard the appeal en banc and, by a vote of 10 to 6,\nreversed. 687 F. 3d, at 234. The court stated that, by the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntime Congress enacted SORNA, Kebodeaux had \u201cfully\nserved\u201d his sex-offense sentence; he was \u201cno longer in\nfederal custody, in the military, under any sort of super-\nvised release or parole, or in any other special relationship\nwith the federal government.\u201d Ibid.\n    The court recognized that, even before SORNA, federal\nlaw required certain federal sex offenders to register. Id.,\nat 235, n. 4. See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Chil-\ndren and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act,\n\u00a7170101, 108 Stat. 2038\u20132042. But it believed that\nthe pre-SORNA federal registration requirements did not\napply to Kebodeaux. 687 F. 3d, at 235, n. 4. Hence, in the\nCircuit\u2019s view, Kebodeaux had been \u201cunconditionally let\n. . . free.\u201d Id., at 234. And, that being so, the Federal\nGovernment lacked the power under Article I\u2019s Necessary\nand Proper Clause to regulate through registration Kebo-\ndeaux\u2019s intrastate movements. Id., at 234\u2013235. In\nparticular, the court said that after \u201cthe federal govern-\nment has unconditionally let a person free . . . the fact\nthat he once committed a crime is not a jurisdictional\nbasis for subsequent regulation and possible criminal\nprosecution.\u201d Ibid.\n    The Solicitor General sought certiorari. And, in light of\nthe fact that a Federal Court of Appeals has held a federal\nstatute unconstitutional, we granted the petition. See,\ne.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 605 (2000);\nUnited States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418, 425\n(1993).\n                             II\n  We do not agree with the Circuit\u2019s conclusion. And, in\nexplaining our reasons, we need not go much further than\nthe Circuit\u2019s critical assumption that Kebodeaux\u2019s release\nwas \u201cunconditional,\u201d i.e., that after Kebodeaux\u2019s release,\nhe was not in \u201cany . . . special relationship with the fed-\neral government.\u201d 687 F. 3d, at 234. To the contrary, the\n4              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitor General, tracing through a complex set of statu-\ntory cross-references, has pointed out that at the time of\nhis offense and conviction Kebodeaux was subject to the\nfederal Wetterling Act, an Act that imposed upon him\nregistration requirements very similar to those that\nSORNA later mandated. Brief for United States 18\u201329.\n   Congress enacted the Wetterling Act in 1994 and up-\ndated it several times prior to Kebodeaux\u2019s offense. Like\nSORNA, it used the federal spending power to encourage\nStates to adopt sex offender registration laws. 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a714071(i) (2000 ed.); Smith, supra, at 89\u201390.             Like\nSORNA, it applied to those who committed federal sex\ncrimes. \u00a714071(b)(7)(A). And like SORNA, it imposed\nfederal penalties upon federal sex offenders who failed to\nregister in the States in which they lived, worked, and\nstudied. \u00a7\u00a714072(i)(3)\u2013(4).\n   In particular, \u00a714072(i)(3) imposed federal criminal\npenalties upon any \u201cperson who is . . . described in section\n4042(c)(4) of title 18, and knowingly fails to register in any\nState in which the person resides.\u201d The cross-referenced\n\u00a74042(c)(4) said that a \u201cperson is described in this para-\ngraph if the person was convicted of \u201d certain enumerated\noffenses or \u201c[a]ny other offense designated by the Attorney\nGeneral as a sexual offense for purposes of this subsec-\ntion.\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a74042(c)(4). In 1998 the Attorney Gen-\neral \u201cdelegated this authority [to designate sex offenses] to\nthe Director of the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d Dept. of Justice,\nBureau of Prisons, Designation of Offenses Subject to Sex\nOffender Release Notification, 63 Fed. Reg. 69386. And\nthat same year the Director of the Bureau of Prisons\n\u201cdesignate[d]\u201d the offense of which Kebodeaux was con-\nvicted, namely the military offense of \u201ccarnal knowledge\u201d\nas set forth in Article 120(B) of the Code of Military Jus-\ntice. Id., at 69387 See 28 CFR \u00a7571.72(b)(2) (1999). A full\nreading of these documents makes clear that, contrary\nto Kebodeaux\u2019s contention, the relevant penalty applied to\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrimes committed by military personnel.\n   Moreover, a different Wetterling Act section imposed\nfederal criminal penalties upon any \u201cperson who is . . .\nsentenced by a court martial for conduct in a category\nspecified by the Secretary of Defense under section\n115(a)(8)(C) of title I of Public Law 105\u2013119, and know-\ningly fails to register in any State in which the person\nresides.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i)(4) (2000 ed.). The cross-\nreferenced section, \u00a7115(a)(8)(C), said that the \u201cSecretary\nof Defense shall specify categories of conduct punishable\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice which encom-\npass a range of conduct comparable to that described in\n[certain provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law\nEnforcement Act of 1994], and such other conduct as the\nSecretary deems appropriate.\u201d 1998 Appropriations Act,\n\u00a7115(a)(8)(C)(i), 111 Stat. 2466. See note following 10\nU. S. C. \u00a7951 (2000 ed.). The Secretary had delegated\ncertain types of authority, such as this last mentioned\n\u201cdeem[ing]\u201d authority, to an Assistant Secretary of De-\nfense. DoD Directive 5124.5, p. 4 (Oct. 31, 1994). And in\nDecember 1998 an Assistant Secretary, acting pursuant to\nthis authority, published a list of military crimes that\nincluded the crime of which Kebodeaux was convicted,\nnamely Article 120(B) of the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 171a\u2013175a. The provision\nadded that \u201c[c]onvictions . . . shall trigger requirements\nto notify state and local law enforcement agencies and to\nprovide information to inmates concerning sex offender\nregistration requirements.\u201d Id., at 175a. And, the provi-\nsion says (contrary to Kebodeaux\u2019s reading, Brief for\nRespondent 57), that it shall \u201ctake effect immediately.\u201d\nIt contains no expiration date. App. to Pet. for Cert. 175a.\n   We are not aware of any plausible counterargument to\nthe obvious conclusion, namely that as of the time of Kebo-\ndeaux\u2019s offense, conviction and release from federal\ncustody, these Wetterling Act provisions applied to Kebo-\n6              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndeaux and imposed upon him registration requirements\nvery similar to those that SORNA later imposed. Con-\ntrary to what the Court of Appeals may have believed, the\nfact that the federal law\u2019s requirements in part involved\ncompliance with state-law requirements made them no\nless requirements of federal law. See generally United\nStates v. Sharpnack, 355 U. S. 286, 293\u2013294 (1958) (Con-\ngress has the power to adopt as federal law the laws of a\nState and to apply them in federal enclaves); Gibbons v.\nOgden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85412\"><a href=\"/scotus/roC/gibbons-appellant-v-ogden-respondent/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207\u2013208 (1824) (\u201cAlthough Congress\ncannot enable a State to legislate, Congress may adopt the\nprovisions of a State on any subject. . . .

See 687 F. 3d, at\n234\u2013235, and n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\u201339. And we believe\nthey would be right to make this concession.\n  No one here claims that the Wetterling Act, as applied\nto military sex offenders like Kebodeaux, falls outside the\nscope of the Necessary and Proper Clause.

S. 321, 355\n(1903). See Morrison, 529 U. S., at 607. The Clause al-\nlows Congress to \u201cadopt any means, appearing to it most\neligible and appropriate, which are adapted to the end to\nbe accomplished and consistent with the letter and spirit\nof the Constitution.\u201d James Everard\u2019s Breweries v. Day,\n265 U. S. 545, 559 (1924).\n   The Constitution, for example, makes few explicit refer-\nences to federal criminal law, but the Necessary and\nProper Clause nonetheless authorizes Congress, in the im-\nplementation of other explicit powers, to create federal\ncrimes, to confine offenders to prison, to hire guards and\nother prison personnel, to provide prisoners with medical\ncare and educational training, to ensure the safety of those\nwho may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the\npublic\u2019s safety through systems of parole and supervised\nrelease, and, where a federal prisoner\u2019s mental condition\nso requires, to confine that prisoner civilly after the expi-\nration of his or her term of imprisonment. See United\nStates v. Comstock, 560 U. S. 126, 136\u2013137 (2010).\n   Here, under the authority granted to it by the Military\n8              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nRegulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses, Congress\ncould promulgate the Uniform Code of Military Justice. It\ncould specify that the sex offense of which Kebodeaux was\nconvicted was a military crime under that Code. It could\npunish that crime through imprisonment and by placing\nconditions upon Kebodeaux\u2019s release. And it could make\nthe civil registration requirement at issue here a conse-\nquence of Kebodeaux\u2019s offense and conviction. This civil\nrequirement, while not a specific condition of Kebodeaux\u2019s\nrelease, was in place at the time Kebodeaux committed his\noffense, and was a consequence of his violation of federal\nlaw.\n  And Congress\u2019 decision to impose such a civil require-\nment that would apply upon the release of an offender like\nKebodeaux is eminently reasonable. Congress could rea-\nsonably conclude that registration requirements applied to\nfederal sex offenders after their release can help protect\nthe public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate\npublic safety concerns. See Smith, 538 U. S., at 102\u2013103\n(sex offender registration has \u201ca legitimate nonpunitive\npurpose of \u2018public safety, which is advanced by alerting the\npublic to the risk of sex offenders in their community\u2019 \u201d).\nThere is evidence that recidivism rates among sex offend-\ners are higher than the average for other types of crimi-\nnals. See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nP. Langan, E. Schmitt, & M. Durose, Recidivism of Sex\nOffenders Released in 1994, p. 1 (Nov. 2003) (reporting\nthat compared to non-sex offenders, released sex offenders\nwere four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex\ncrime, and that within the first three years following\nrelease 5.3% of released sex offenders were rearrested for\na sex crime). There is also conflicting evidence on the\npoint. Cf. R. Tewsbury, W. Jennings, & K. Zgoba, Final\nReport on Sex Offenders: Recidivism and Collateral Con-\nsequences (Sept. 2011) (concluding that sex offenders have\nrelatively low rates of recidivism, and that registration\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrequirements have limited observable benefits regarding\nrecidivism). But the Clause gives Congress the power to\nweigh the evidence and to reach a rational conclusion, for\nexample, that safety needs justify postrelease registration\nrules. See Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U. S. 581, 594\u2013\n595 (1926) (upholding congressional statute limiting the\namount of spirituous liquor that may be prescribed by\na physician, and noting that Congress\u2019 \u201cfinding [regard-\ning the appropriate amount], in the presence of the well-\nknown diverging opinions of physicians, cannot be regarded\nas arbitrary or without a reasonable basis\u201d).

United States, 560 U. S. 438, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 12). The Federal Government has long kept track\nof former federal prisoners through probation, parole, and\nsupervised release in part to prevent further crimes there-\nby protecting the public against the risk of recidivism. See\nParole Act, 36 Stat. 819; Probation Act, ch. 521, 43 Stat.\n1259; Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, ch. II, 98 Stat. 1987.\nSee also 1 N. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole\n\u00a7\u00a77:3, 7:4 (2d ed. 1999) (principal purposes of postrelease\nconditions are to rehabilitate the convict, thus preventing\n10             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhim from recidivating, and to protect the public). Neither,\nas of 1994, was registration particularly novel, for by then\nStates had implemented similar requirements for close to\nhalf a century. See W. Logan, Knowledge as Power: Crim-\ninal Registration and Community Notification Laws in\nAmerica 30\u201331 (2009). Moreover, the Wetterling Act took\nstate interests into account by, for the most part, requiring\nreleased federal offenders to register in accordance with\nstate law. At the same time, the Wetterling Act\u2019s re-\nquirements were reasonably narrow and precise, tying\ntime limits to the type of sex offense, incorporating state-\nlaw details, and relating penalties for violations to the\nsex crime initially at issue. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a714071(b)\n(2000 ed.).\n   The upshot is that here Congress did not apply SORNA\nto an individual who had, prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment,\nbeen \u201cunconditionally released,\u201d i.e., a person who was not\nin \u201cany . . . special relationship with the federal govern-\nment,\u201d but rather to an individual already subject to fed-\neral registration requirements that were themselves a\nvalid exercise of federal power under the Military Regula-\ntion and Necessary and Proper Clauses. But cf. post, at 1\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   SORNA, enacted after Kebodeaux\u2019s release, somewhat\nmodified the applicable registration requirements. In gen-\neral, SORNA provided more detailed definitions of sex\noffenses, described in greater detail the nature of the\ninformation registrants must provide, and imposed some-\nwhat different limits upon the length of time that regis-\ntration must continue and the frequency with which\noffenders must update their registration. 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a716911,\n16913\u201316916 (2006 ed. and Supp. V). But the statute, like\nthe Wetterling Act, used Spending Clause grants to en-\ncourage States to adopt its uniform definitions and re-\nquirements. It did not insist that the States do so. See\n\u00a7\u00a716925(a), (d) (2006 ed.) (\u201cThe provisions of this subchap-\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Compare 42\nU. S. C. \u00a716913(c) with App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a\u2013168a.\nSORNA also increased the federal penalty for a federal\noffender\u2019s registration violation to a maximum of 10 years\nfrom a maximum of 1 year for a first offense. Compare\n18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i) (2000\ned.). Kebodeaux was sentenced to one year and one day\nof imprisonment. For purposes of federal law, SORNA re-\nduced the duration of Kebodeaux\u2019s registration require-\nment to 25 years from the lifetime requirement imposed\nby Texas law, compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716915(a) (2006 ed.)\nwith App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a, and reduced the frequency\nwith which Kebodeaux must update his registration to\nevery six months from every 90 days as imposed by Texas\nlaw, compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716916(2) with App. to Pet. for\nCert. 167a. And as far as we can tell, while SORNA pun-\nishes violations of its requirements (instead of violations of\nstate law), the Federal Government has prosecuted a sex\noffender for violating SORNA only when that offender also\nviolated state-registration requirements.\n  SORNA\u2019s general changes were designed to make more\nuniform what had remained \u201ca patchwork of federal and\n50 individual state registration systems,\u201d Reynolds v.\nUnited States, 565 U.

The majority, having estab-\nlished that premise and thus resolved the case before us,\nnevertheless goes on to discuss the general public safety\nbenefits of the registration requirement. Ante, at 8\u201310.\nBecause that analysis is beside the point in this case, I con-\ncur in the judgment only.\n   While serving in the Air Force, Kebodeaux violated the\nUniform Code of Military Justice by having sexual rela-\ntions with a minor. A special court-martial convicted him.\nAs relevant here, that conviction had two consequences:\nFirst, Kebodeaux was sentenced to confinement for three\nmonths. And second, as the majority describes, he was\nrequired to register as a sex offender with the State in\nwhich he resided and keep that registration current; fail-\nure to do so would subject him to federal criminal penal-\nties. Ante, at 4\u20136.\n   In the same way that Congress undoubtedly had the au-\nthority to impose the first consequence for a violation of\nmilitary rules, it also had the authority to impose the\nsecond. The Constitution gives Congress the power \u201c[t]o\nmake Rules for the Government and Regulation of the\n2             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nland and naval Forces.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14. And, under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress can give those\nrules force by imposing consequences on members of the\nmilitary who disobey them. See McCulloch v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1320585\"><a href=\"/scotus/7LyH/mcculloch-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416 (1819) (\u201cAll admit that the government\nmay, legitimately, punish any violation of its laws; and\nyet, this is not among the enumerated powers of Con-\ngress.\u201d). A servicemember will be less likely to violate a\nrelevant military regulation if he knows that, having done\nso, he will be required to register as a sex offender years\ninto the future.\n   It is this power, the power to regulate the conduct of\nmembers of the military by imposing consequences for\ntheir violations of military law, that supports application\nof the federal registration obligation to Kebodeaux. As the\nCourt explains, the Wetterling Act was in force when\nKebodeaux committed the original offense, and applied to\nhim as soon as the special court-martial rendered its\nverdict. See ante, at 5\u20136. Congress later, in enacting the\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA),\nmodified the registration regime in place under the Wet-\nterling Act. But as applied to Kebodeaux here (the rele-\nvant inquiry in this as-applied challenge), those changes\nwere insignificant; their only effect was that Kebodeaux\nreceived a day more than he could have received for the\nsame conduct had the Wetterling Act remained in force.\nSee ante, at 11 (describing SORNA\u2019s effect on Kebodeaux\u2019s\nregistration obligations); compare post, at 10, n. 3\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (discussing changes that did not\naffect Kebodeaux). Whatever other constitutional con-\ncerns might attach to such a change, as a question of\nArticle I power it was permissible. Just as the Federal\nGovernment may, under the Necessary and Proper\nClause, alter the conditions of a federal prisoner\u2019s con-\nfinement or adjust the timing and location of drug\ntests required of a federal convict, so too could it make\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

But sandwiched between its discussion of the\nbasis for Congress\u2019s power and its discussion of the incon-\nsequential nature of the changes is a discussion of benefits\nfrom the registration system. Along with giving force to\nmilitary regulations, the majority notes, Congress could\nalso have \u201creasonably conclude[d] that registration re-\nquirements . . . help protect the public from . . . federal sex\noffenders and alleviate public safety concerns.\u201d Ante, at 8.\n   Maybe so, but those consequences of the registration\nrequirement are irrelevant for our purposes. Public safety\nbenefits are neither necessary nor sufficient to a proper\nexercise of the power to regulate the military. What\nmatters\u2014all that matters\u2014is that Congress could have\nrationally determined that \u201cmak[ing] the civil registration\nrequirement at issue here a consequence of Kebodeaux\u2019s\noffense\u201d would give force to the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice adopted pursuant to Congress\u2019s power to regulate\nthe Armed Forces. Ibid.\n   Ordinarily such surplusage might not warrant a sepa-\nrate writing. Here, however, I worry that incautious\nreaders will think they have found in the majority opinion\nsomething they would not find in either the Constitution\nor any prior decision of ours: a federal police power. The\ndanger of such confusion is heightened by the fact the\nSolicitor General adopted something very close to the\npolice power argument, contending that \u201cthe federal gov-\nernment has greater ties to former federal sex offenders\nthan it does to other members of the general public,\u201d and\ncan therefore impose restrictions on them even years after\ntheir unconditional release simply to \u201cserve[ ] . . . public-\nprotection purposes.\u201d Brief for United States 34\u201335.\n   I write separately to stress not only that a federal police\npower is immaterial to the result in this case, but also that\n4             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n             ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment\n\nsuch a power could not be material to the result in this\ncase\u2014because it does not exist. See United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U.

Thus, while the Necessary and\nProper Clause authorizes congressional action \u201cincidental\nto [an enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial\nexercise,\u201d Chief Justice Marshall was emphatic that no\n\u201cgreat substantive and independent power\u201d can be \u201cim-\nplied as incidental to other powers, or used as a means of\nexecuting them.\u201d Id., at 418, 411; see also Gibbons v.\nOgden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85412\"><a href=\"/scotus/roC/gibbons-appellant-v-ogden-respondent/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (1824) (\u201cThe enumeration presup-\nposes something not enumerated\u201d).\n   It is difficult to imagine a clearer example of such a\n\u201cgreat substantive and independent power\u201d than the\npower to \u201chelp protect the public . . . and alleviate pub-\nlic safety concerns,\u201d ante, at 8. I find it implausible to\nsuppose\u2014and impossible to support\u2014that the Framers in-\ntended to confer such authority by implication rather than\nexpression. A power of that magnitude vested in the\nFederal Government is not \u201cconsist[ent] with the letter\nand spirit of the constitution,\u201d McCulloch, supra, at 421,\nand thus not a \u201cproper [means] for carrying into Execu-\ntion\u201d the enumerated powers of the Federal Government,\nU. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. See United States v. Com-\nstock, 560 U.

J., concurring in judgment\n\nNecessary and Proper Clause\u201d).\n  It makes no difference that the Federal Government\nwould be policing people previously convicted of a federal\ncrime\u2014even a federal sex crime. The fact of a prior fed-\neral conviction, by itself, does not give Congress a freestand-\ning, independent, and perpetual interest in protecting the\npublic from the convict\u2019s purely intrastate conduct.\n  But as I have said, I do not understand the majority\u2019s\nopinion to be based on such a power. The connection to\nthe Military Regulation Clause on which the majority\nrelies, ante, at 8, is less attenuated, and the power it\nproduces less substantial, than would be true of a federal\npolice power over prior federal offenders; the power to\nthreaten and impose particular obligations as a result of a\nviolation of military law is not such a \u201cgreat substantive\nand independent power\u201d that the Framers\u2019 failure to enu-\nmerate it must imply its absence.\n  Nevertheless, I fear that the majority\u2019s discussion of the\npublic-safety benefits of the registration requirement will\nbe mistaken for an endorsement of the Solicitor General\u2019s\npublic-safety basis for the law. I accordingly concur in the\njudgment only.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

See, e.g., UCMJ Art.\n2 (persons subject to UCMJ); Art. 5 (\u201cThis chapter applies\nin all places\u201d); Art. 120 (rape by a person subject to\nUCMJ); Solorio v. United States, 483 U.

For example, if the service-\nmember is convicted of a sex offense in a state court, the\nstate court may be required by state law to provide that\ninformation to the state registry. See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. \u00a716\u201322\u2013104(1)(a)(I) (2012). State law may also\nrequire the state corrections department to notify both\nstate and local police of the offender\u2019s release.

Because the exercise of military jurisdiction\nmay have this effect\u2014in other words, may create a gap in\nthe laws intended to maximize the registration of sex\noffenders\u2014it is necessary and proper for Congress to\nrequire the registration of members of the military who\nare convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military\ncourt. When Congress, in validly exercising a power ex-\npressly conferred by the Constitution, creates or exacer-\nbates a dangerous situation (here, the possibility that a\nconvicted sex offender may escape registration), Congress\nhas the power to try to eliminate or at least diminish that\ndanger.

S. C. \u00a716901 et seq., for failing to update his sex of-\nfender registration when he moved from one Texas city to\nanother. The Court today holds that Congress has power\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact SORNA\nand criminalize Kebodeaux\u2019s failure to update his registra-\ntion. I disagree. As applied to Kebodeaux, SORNA does\nnot \u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d any of the federal powers enu-\nmerated in the Constitution. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Rather,\nit usurps the general police power vested in the States.\nBecause SORNA\u2019s registration requirements are unconsti-\ntutional as applied to Kebodeaux, I respectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  Congress enacted SORNA in 2006. SORNA requires\nthat every \u201csex offender shall register, and keep the regis-\ntration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender\nresides, where the offender is an employee, and where the\noffender is a student.\u201d 42 U.

As relevant here, SORNA makes it a federal\ncrime when someone who is required to register as a sex\noffender \u201cknowingly fails to register or update a regis-\ntration\u201d and that person \u201cis a sex offender [as defined\nby SORNA] by reason of a conviction under Federal\nlaw (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d 18\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a72250(a)(2)(A), (3).\n  In March 1999, Anthony Kebodeaux had consensual sex\nwith a 15-year-old girl when he was a 20-year-old Air-\nman in the U. S. Air Force. He was convicted by a court-\nmartial of carnal knowledge of a female under the age\nof 16, in violation of Article 120(b) of the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ). He was sentenced to three\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment and received a bad-conduct dis-\ncharge. He completed his sentence in September 1999 and\nwas no longer in federal custody or the military when\nCongress enacted SORNA, which required him to register\nas a sex offender. In 2007, Kebodeaux failed to update his\nsex-offender registration within three days of moving from\nEl Paso, Texas, to San Antonio, Texas. He was convicted\nunder \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) in 2008 and sentenced to a year and\na day in prison. The question before the Court is whether\nCongress has power to require Kebodeaux to register as a\nsex offender and to criminalize his failure to do so.\n                            II\n\n                            A\n\n  The Constitution creates a Federal Government with\nlimited powers. Congress has no powers except those\nspecified in the Constitution. See Marbury v. Madison,\n1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (\u201cThe powers of\nthe legislature are defined, and limited; and that those\nlimits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Thus, \u201c[e]very law enacted by Congress must\nbe based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the\nConstitution.\u201d United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,\n607 (2000).\n   A different default rule applies to the States. As the\nTenth Amendment makes clear, the States enjoy all pow-\ners that the Constitution does not withhold from them.\n(\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d) While\nthe powers of Congress are \u201cfew and defined,\u201d the powers\nthat \u201cremain in the State governments are numerous and\nindefinite.\u201d The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed.\n1961) (J. Madison).\n   The Constitution sets forth Congress\u2019 limited powers in\nArticle I. That Article begins by \u201cvest[ing]\u201d in Congress\n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,\u201d and then enu-\nmerates those powers in \u00a78. The final clause of \u00a78, the\nNecessary and Proper Clause, gives Congress power \u201c[t]o\nmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for\ncarrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other\nPowers vested by this Constitution in the Government\nof the United States, or in any Department or Officer\nthereof.\u201d Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. Importantly, the Necessary and\nProper Clause is not a freestanding grant of congressional\npower, but rather an authorization to makes laws that are\nnecessary to execute both the powers vested in Congress\nby the preceding clauses of \u00a78, and the powers vested in\nCongress and the other branches by other provisions of the\nConstitution. See, e.g., Kinsella v. United States ex rel.\nSingleton, 361 U. S. 234, 247 (1960) (\u201cThe [Necessary and\nProper Clause] is not itself a grant of power, but a caveat\nthat the Congress possesses all the means necessary to\ncarry out the specifically granted \u2018foregoing\u2019 powers of \u00a78\n\u2018and all other Powers vested by this Constitution\u2019 \u201d).\n   In McCulloch v.

KEBODEAUX\n\n                      THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nJustice Marshall famously set forth the Court\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of the Necessary and Proper Clause:\n    \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n    the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n    which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n    prohibited, but consist[ent] with the letter and spirit\n    of the constitution, are constitutional.\u201d Id., at 421.\nUnder this formulation, a federal law is a valid exercise of\nCongress\u2019 power under the Clause if it satisfies a two-part\ntest. \u201cFirst, the law must be directed toward a \u2018legitimate\u2019\nend, which McCulloch defines as one \u2018within the scope of\nthe [C]onstitution.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Comstock, 560\nU. S. 126, 160 (2010) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting 4\nWheat., at 421). In other words, the law must be directed\nat \u201ccarrying into Execution\u201d one or more of the powers\ndelegated to the Federal Government by the Constitution.\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 18. \u201cSecond, there must be a necessary and\nproper fit between the \u2018means\u2019 (the federal law) and the\n\u2018end\u2019 (the enumerated power or powers) it is designed to\nserve.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 160 (THOMAS, J., dissent-\ning). \u201cThe means Congress selects will be deemed \u2018neces-\nsary\u2019 if they are \u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018plainly adapted\u2019 to the\nexercise of an enumerated power, and \u2018proper\u2019 if they are\nnot otherwise \u2018prohibited\u2019 by the Constitution and not\n\u2018[in]consistent\u2019 with its \u2018letter and spirit.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 160\u2013161\n(quoting Art.

As\napplied to Kebodeaux, SORNA fails this test.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n                               B\n   It is undisputed that no enumerated power in Article I,\n\u00a78, gives Congress the power to punish sex offenders who\nfail to register, nor does any other provision in the Consti-\ntution vest Congress or the other branches of the Federal\nGovernment with such a power. Thus, SORNA is a valid\nexercise of congressional authority only if it is \u201cnecessary\nand proper for carrying into Execution\u201d one or more of\nthose federal powers enumerated in the Constitution.\n   In the course of this litigation, the Government has\nargued that Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction under \u00a72250(a)(2)(A)\nexecutes Congress\u2019 enumerated powers to spend for the gen-\neral welfare, Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1; to regulate interstate com-\nmerce, \u00a78, cl. 3; and to regulate the armed forces, \u00a78,\ncl. 14. But none of these powers justifies applying\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) to Kebodeaux. The Spending Clause ar-\ngument is a nonstarter. Section 2250(a)(2)(A) does not\nexecute Congress\u2019 spending power because it regulates\nindividuals who have not necessarily received federal funds\nof any kind. The Government contends that \u201cfederal fund-\ning and logistical support offered to States for their sex-\noffender-registration-and-notification programs can be\neffective only if persons required to register actually do so\u201d\nand that \u201cCongress may impose penalties on such individ-\nuals as a means of achieving that goal.\u201d Brief for United\nStates 52. But we have never held that Congress gains\nthe power to regulate private individuals merely because\nit provides money to the States in which they reside.\n   Nor does the Commerce Clause\u2014the enumerated power\nthat the Court has construed most broadly\u2014support\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A). Under this Court\u2019s precedents, Congress\nmay use its Commerce Clause power to regulate (1) \u201c \u2018the\nuse of the channels of interstate commerce,\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c \u2018the\ninstrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or\nthings in interstate commerce,\u2019 \u201d and (3) economic activi-\nties that \u201c \u2018substantially affect interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d\n6              UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558\u2013559 (1995); see\nalso Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617. Section 2250(a)(2)(A)\ndoes not fall within the first two categories because it is\nnot limited to regulating sex offenders who have traveled\nin interstate commerce. Instead, it applies to all federal\nsex offenders who fail to register, even if they never cross\nstate lines. Nor does \u00a72250(a)(2)(A) fall within the third\ncategory. Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity,\nsuch as sex crimes, based on the effect it might have on\ninterstate commerce. Cf. Morrison, supra, at 617. (\u201cWe . . .\nreject the argument that Congress may regulate noneco-\nnomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that con-\nduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce\u201d). In short,\n\u00a72250(a)(2)(A) regulates activity that is neither \u201c \u2018inter-\nstate\u2019 \u201d nor \u201c \u2018commercial,\u2019 \u201d 687 F. 3d 232, 253 (CA5 2012),\nand, thus, it cannot be justified on the ground that it\nexecutes Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce.\n  Finally, Congress\u2019 power \u201c[t]o make Rules for the Gov-\nernment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\u201d\ndoes not support Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction under \u00a72250(a)\n(2)(A). Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14. Kebodeaux had long since\nfully served his criminal sentence for violating Article\n120(b) of the UCMJ and was no longer in the military\nwhen Congress enacted SORNA. Congress does not retain\na general police power over every person who has ever\nserved in the military. See United States ex rel. Toth v.\nQuarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14 (1955) (\u201cIt has never been inti-\nmated by this Court . . . that Article I military jurisdiction\ncould be extended to civilian ex-soldiers who had severed\nall relationship with the military and its institutions. . . .\n[G]iven its natural meaning, the power granted Congress\n\u2018To make Rules\u2019 to regulate \u2018the land and naval Forces\u2019\nwould seem to restrict court-martial jurisdiction to per-\nsons who are actually members or part of the armed\nforces\u201d).

It begins\nby explaining that \u201cat the time of his offense Kebodeaux\nwas subject to the federal Wetterling Act, an Act that\nimposed upon him registration requirements very similar\nto those that SORNA later mandated.\u201d3 Ante, at 4. But\nthat is beside the point. Kebodeaux was convicted of\nviolating SORNA\u2019s registration requirements, not the\nWetterling Act\u2019s, and so the relevant question is what\nenumerated power SORNA \u201ccarr[ies] into Execution.\u201d\n\u201cThe Necessary and Proper Clause does not provide Con-\ngress with authority to enact any law simply because it\nfurthers other laws Congress has enacted in the exercise\nof its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires\na showing that every federal statute \u2018carr[ies] into\nExecution\u2019 one or more of the Federal Government\u2019s enu-\nmerated powers.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 168 (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting).\n   Nevertheless, apparently in an effort to bootstrap the\nWetterling Act, the Court proceeds to determine whether\nthe Wetterling Act (not SORNA) falls within Congress\u2019\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 THE CHIEF JUSTICE wrongly asserts that the differences between the\n\nWetterling Act and SORNA are \u201cinsignificant.\u201d Ante, at 2 (opinion\nconcurring in judgment). SORNA increases the federal penalty for fail-\ning to register from a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one\nyear to a felony punishable by up to 10 years for a first offense. Com-\npare 18 U. S. C. \u00a72250(a) with 42 U. S. C. \u00a714072(i) (2000 ed.). It is\nsimply incorrect to minimize that change by saying that Kebodeaux\nreceived only a day more than he could have received for failing to\nregister under the Wetterling Act. Ante, at 2 (ROBERTS, C. J., concur-\nring in judgment). The \u201clegally prescribed range is the penalty affixed\nto the crime,\u201d Alleyne v. United States, ante, at 11, and SORNA in-\ncreased that range significantly. SORNA also requires that a sex\noffender who moves update his registration within three days of mov-\ning, instead of seven. Compare 42 U. S. C. \u00a716913(c) with App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 167a\u2013168a. Thus, a person can be convicted under SORNA for\nconduct that would have complied with the Wetterling Act.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\npower under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court\nfirst notes that the Clause \u201c \u2018leave[s] to Congress a large\ndiscretion as to the means that may be employed in exe-\ncuting a given power,\u2019 \u201d ante, at 7 (quoting Lottery Case,\n188 U. S. 321, 355 (1903))\u2014a fact that is entirely irrele-\nvant under McCulloch\u2019s first step of determining whether\nthe end is itself legitimate. The Court then observes that\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause\n    \u201cauthorizes Congress, in the implementation of other\n    explicit powers, to create federal crimes, to confine of-\n    fenders to prison, to hire guards and other prison per-\n    sonnel, to provide prisoners with medical care and\n    educational training, to ensure the safety of those who\n    may come into contact with prisoners, to ensure the\n    public\u2019s safety through systems of parole and super-\n    vised release, and, where a federal prisoner\u2019s mental\n    condition so requires, to confine that prisoner civilly\n    after the expiration of his or her term of imprison-\n    ment.\u201d Ante, at 7.\nFrom these powers, the Court reasons that the Wetterling\nAct is valid because \u201cCongress could reasonably conclude\nthat registration requirements applied to federal sex\noffenders after their release can help protect the public\nfrom those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety\nconcerns.\u201d Ante, at 8. As I explained in Comstock, how-\never, this mode of analysis confuses the inquiry. 560 U. S.\nat 168\u2013169 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). \u201cFederal laws that\ncriminalize conduct . . . , establish prisons for those who\nengage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and\ntreatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal\nsentence\u201d are only valid if they \u201c \u2018Execut[e]\u2019 \u201d an enumer-\nated power. Id., at 169. Here, for example, Congress has\nauthority to enact Article 120(b) of the UCMJ, to enforce\nthat provision against military personnel who violate it,\nand to confine them in a military prison while they are\n12             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nawaiting trial and serving a sentence. All of those actions\n\u201ccarr[y] into Execution\u201d Congress\u2019 power to promote order\nand discipline within the military by regulating the con-\nduct of military personnel. Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 14.\n    But the enumerated power that justified Kebodeaux\u2019s\nconviction does not justify requiring him to register as a\nsex offender now that he is a civilian. If Kebodeaux were\nrequired to register as part of his criminal sentence, then\nregistration would help execute the power that justifies\nhis conviction. The court-martial here, however, did not\nimpose registration requirements at Kebodeaux\u2019s sentenc-\ning. See ante, at 8 (acknowledging that registration is a\n\u201ccivil requirement\u201d and was \u201cnot a specific condition of\nKebodeaux\u2019s release\u201d). Enacted long after Kebodeaux had\ncompleted his sentence, SORNA cannot be justified as a\npunishment for the offense Kebodeaux committed while in\nthe military because retroactively increasing his punish-\nment would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See Peugh\nv. United States, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8)\n(explaining that laws that \u201c \u2018inflic[t] a greater punishment\n. . . than the law annexed to the crime . . . when commit-\nted\u2019 \u201d violate the Ex Post Facto Clause) (quoting Calder v.\nBull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)); Peugh, supra, at ___\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11) (explaining that\n\u201claws retroactively increasing the punishment were . . .\nunderstood to be ex post facto at the time of the found-\ning\u201d). As the Court below correctly recognized, \u201cbecause\nSORNA\u2019s registration requirements are civil and were\nenacted after Kebodeaux committed his crime, the\n[G]overnment cannot justify their constitutionality on the\nground that they merely punish Kebodeaux for the crime\nhe committed while in the military.\u201d 687 F. 3d, at 239.\nThe only justification for SORNA that the Government\nhas advanced is protection of the public, but that justifica-\ntion has nothing to do with Congress\u2019 power to regulate\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

See\nArt. VI, cl. 2. \u201cAs long as it is acting within the powers\ngranted it under the Constitution, Congress may impose\nits will on the States.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that Congress has authority to impose\n\nregistration as a consequence of Kebodeaux\u2019s conviction because \u201c[a]\nservicemember will be less likely to violate a relevant military regula-\ntion if he knows that, having done so, he will be required to register as\na sex offender years into the future.\u201d Ante, at 2. But SORNA could not\npossibly have deterred Kebodeaux from violating any military regula-\ntion because it was enacted after he left the military.\n   JUSTICE ALITO contends that, by trying members of the military in a\nmilitary court, Congress exacerbated \u201cthe possibility that a convicted\nsex offender may escape [the state] registration [system],\u201d and that\nSORNA is necessary and proper to correct this problem. Ante, at 3\n(opinion concurring in judgment). But JUSTICE ALITO has not identified\nany enumerated power that gives Congress authority to address this\nsupposed problem, and there is no evidence that such a problem exists.\nIndeed, Texas has indicated that SORNA undermines its registration\nsystem, rather than making it more effective. See Letter from Jeffrey\nS. Boyd, General Counsel and Acting Chief of Staff, Texas Office of the\nGovernor, to Linda Baldwin, Director, SMART Office 1 (Aug. 17, 2011)\n(\u201cAlthough we in Texas certainly appreciate and agree with the stated\ngoals of SORNA, the adoption of this \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 federal legisla-\ntion in Texas would in fact undermine the accomplishment of those\nobjectives in Texas, just as it would in most other states\u201d), online\nat http: // www.ncleg.net / documentsites / committees / JLOCJPS / October%\n2013,%202011%20Meeting / RD_SORNA_General_Information_2011-10-\n13.pdf (as visited June 21, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case\nfile).\n14             UNITED STATES v. KEBODEAUX\n\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\n460 (1991). The fact that the Wetterling Act and SORNA\nmay be \u201cnarrow\u201d and \u201c[take] state interests into account,\u201d\nante, at 10, is \u201cnot a matter of constitutional necessity, but\nan act of legislative grace.\u201d Comstock, 560 U. S., at 178\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). These factors have no place in\ndeciding whether a law \u201cExecut[es]\u201d an enumerated power.\n                              B\n   The Court not only ignores the limitations on Congress\u2019\npower set forth in the Constitution, but it also ignores the\nlimits that it marked just three years ago in Comstock. In\nthat case, this Court held that Congress has power under\nthe Necessary and Proper Clause to enact 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a74248, which authorizes the Federal Government to civilly\ncommit \u201csexually dangerous persons\u201d beyond the date it\nlawfully could hold them on a charge or conviction for a\nfederal crime. Comstock, 560 U. S., at 142. The Court\nrebuffed the assertion that it was conferring a general\npolice power on Congress by asserting that \u00a74248 was\n\u201climited to individuals already \u2018in the custody of the\u2019 Fed-\neral Government.\u201d Id., at 148. The Solicitor General even\nconceded at oral argument that \u201cthe Federal Government\nwould not have . . . the power to commit a person who . . .\nhas been released from prison and whose period of super-\nvised release is also completed\u201d because \u201cat that point the\nState police power over a person has been fully reestab-\nlished.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Comstock O. T.\n2009, No. 08\u20131224, p. 9. The Court and the Government\ntoday abandon even that meager restriction, which itself\nlies far beyond the constitutional limits. Kebodeaux was\nno longer in federal custody when Congress enacted\nSORNA, yet the Court disregards the fact that, even\nunder Comstock, release from prison and supervised re-\nlease terminates any hold the Federal Government might\notherwise have and \u201cfully reestablishe[d]\u201d the State\u2019s\npolice power over that individual.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.
