RYAN, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPART-\n\n    MENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETITIONER v.\n\n           EDWARD HAROLD SCHAD \n\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                No. 12\u20131084. Decided June 24, 2013\n\n\n   PER CURIAM.\n   Respondent Edward Schad was convicted of first-degree\nmurder and sentenced to death. After an extensive series of\nstate- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this\nCourt\u2019s denial of respondent\u2019s petitions for certiorari and\nfor rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its\nmandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appel\u00ad\nlate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D). The Ninth Circuit instead,\nsua sponte, construed respondent\u2019s motion to stay the\nmandate pending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in a sepa\u00ad\nrate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that\nit had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of\nthat previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a\nfew days before respondent\u2019s scheduled execution. Even\nassuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, 545 U. S. 794\n(2005), that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the\nNinth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional cir\u00ad\ncumstances justified withholding its mandate. As a result,\nwe conclude that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s failure to issue its\nmandate constituted an abuse of discretion.\n                             I\n   In 1985, an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of\nfirst-degree murder for the 1978 strangling of 74-year-old\nLorimer Grove.1 The court sentenced respondent to death.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1A   state habeas court vacated an earlier guilty verdict and death\n2                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nAfter respondent\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed\non direct review, see State v. Schad, 163 Ariz. 411, 788\nP. 2d 1162 (1989), and Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624\n(1991), respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleg\u00ad\ning that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at\nsentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient\nmitigating evidence. The state courts denied relief.\n  In August 1998, respondent sought federal habeas relief.\nHe again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sen\u00ad\ntencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evi\u00ad\ndence. The District Court denied respondent\u2019s request\nfor an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi\u00ad\ndence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in\ndeveloping the evidence during his state habeas proceed\u00ad\nings. Schad v. Schriro, 454 F. Supp. 2d 897 (Ariz. 2006).\nThe District Court alternatively held that the proffered\nnew evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s\nperformance was deficient. Id., at 940\u2013947. The Ninth\nCircuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded\nto the District Court for a hearing to determine whether\nrespondent\u2019s state habeas counsel was diligent in develop\u00ad\ning the state evidentiary record. Schad v. Ryan, 606 F. 3d\n1022 (2010). Arizona petitioned for certiorari. This Court\ngranted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion,\nand remanded for further proceedings in light of Cullen v.\nPinholster, 563 U. S. ___ (2011). See Ryan v. Schad, 563\nU. S. ___ (2011). On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed\nthe District Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. Schad v. Ryan,\n671 F. 3d 708, 726 (2011). The Ninth Circuit subsequently\ndenied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on\nFebruary 28, 2012.\n  On July 10, 2012, respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit\nthe first motion directly at issue in this case. This motion\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nsentence due to an error in jury instructions. See State v. Schad, 142\n\nAriz. 619, 691 P. 2d 710 (1984). \n\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

Ryan, 566 U. S. 1 (2012).2\nThe Ninth Circuit denied respondent\u2019s motion on July 27,\n2012. Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari. This\nCourt denied the petition on October 9, 2012, 568 U. S.\n___, and denied a petition for rehearing on January 7,\n2013. 568 U. S. ___.\n   Respondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and\nfiled a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light\nof a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the\ninteraction between Pinholster and Martinez. The Ninth\nCircuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, \u201cde-\nclin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that\nwould unduly interfere with Arizona\u2019s execution process.\u201d\nOrder in No. 07\u201399005, Doc. 102, p. 1. But instead of\nissuing the mandate, the court decided sua sponte to con\u00ad\nstrue respondent\u2019s motion \u201cas a motion to reconsider our\nprior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Re\u00ad\nmand in light of Martinez,\u201d which the court had denied on\nJuly 27, 2012. Id., at 2. The court ordered briefing and, in\na divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court\nto determine whether respondent could establish that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un\u00ad\nder Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice\nas a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel had merit. No. 07\u201399005 (Feb.\n26, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u201313 to A\u201315, 2013 WL\n791610, *6. Judge Graber dissented based on her conclu\u00ad\nsion that respondent could not show prejudice. Id., at A\u2013\n16 to A\u201317, 2013 WL 791610, *7. Arizona set an execution\ndate of March 6, 2013, which prompted respondent to file\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 Martinez,566 U. S. 1, was decided on March 20, 2012. We are un\u00ad\naware of any explanation for respondent\u2019s delay in bringing his\nMartinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s attention.\n4                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\na motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013. The\nNinth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013,\nwith Judge Graber again noting her dissent.\n   On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing\nand rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court\ndenied the petition the same day, with eight judges dis\u00ad\nsenting in two separate opinions. 709 F. 3d 855 (2013).\n   On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the\nstay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for\ncertiorari. This Court denied the application, with JUS-\nTICES SCALIA and ALITO noting that they would grant\nit. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We now consider the petition.\n                             II\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets\nforth the default rule that \u201c[t]he court of appeals must\nissue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme\nCourt order denying the petition for writ of certiorari\nis filed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is\nstraightforward: \u201c[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely\nto allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio\u00ad\nrari.\u201d Bell, 545 U. S., at 806. Hence, once this Court has\ndenied a petition, there is generally no need for further\naction from the lower courts. See ibid. (\u201c[A] decision by\nthis Court denying discretionary review usually signals\nthe end of litigation\u201d). In Bell, Tennessee argued that\nRule 41(d)(2)(D) \u201cadmits of no exceptions, so the mandate\nshould have issued on the date\u201d the Court of Appeals\nreceived notice of the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari.\nId., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell\nbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of\nthe mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803\u2013804. As\nin Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that\nthe Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n   Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nreviewed in federal habeas proceedings, \u201cfinality and comity\nconcerns,\u201d based in principles of federalism, demand\nthat federal courts \u201caccord the appropriate level of respect\nto\u201d state judgments by allowing them to be enforced\nwhen federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812\u2013813.\nAs we noted, States have an \u201c \u2018 \u201cinterest in the finality of\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\nstate court system.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.\nThompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else\u00ad\nwhere, we explained that \u201c \u2018the profound interests in\nrepose\u2019 attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals\u201d\ndictate that \u201cthe power [to withdraw the mandate] can be\nexercised only in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Calderon,\nsupra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73938, p. 712 (2d\ned. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is\na power \u201cof last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,\nunforeseen contingencies.\u201d Calderon, supra, at 550. Even\nassuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it\nabuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate\nonce the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless\nextraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n   Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi\u00ad\nnary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of\njustice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged\nin state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel\nhad been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient\nmitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545\nU. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the\nsame argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that\n\u201cplaced substantial emphasis\u201d on his argument that the\nSixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.\nId., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it\nstayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant\n6                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of\nthe writ. Ibid.\n   When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the\nSixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth\nCircuit waited five months (and until two days before the\nscheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va-\ncated the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-\nof-counsel claim. Id., at 800\u2013801. This Court reversed\nthat decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate\nwithout notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously\nrejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal\u00ad\nism principles.\n   In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its\ndiscretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,\nthe Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate\nbased on an argument it had considered and rejected\nmonths earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nFebruary 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had\nbeen over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly\n7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3\n   Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented\nin the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to\nthose accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru\u00ad\nary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a \u201cMotion to\nVacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for\nAdditional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.\u201d No.\n07\u201399005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the\nonly claim presented in that motion was that respondent\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Respondentdid not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit\nultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit\ndenied respondent\u2019s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc\nand more than 3\u00bd months after Martinez was decided.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npostconviction counsel should have developed more evi\u00ad\ndence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim. Here, as in Bell, respondent\u2019s July 10 motion\n\u201cpressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted\nby the Court of Appeals.\u201d 545 U. S., at 806. These ar-\nguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion\nthat \u201c[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been\nclearer.\u201d Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full \u201coppor\u00ad\ntunity to consider these arguments\u201d but declined to do so,\nid., at 806, which \u201csupport[s] our determination that the\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error.\u201d Id., at\n806\u2013807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully\nconsiders each motion a capital defendant presents on\nhabeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that\n\u201cjudges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of\na petition for rehearing\u201d). As a result, there is no indica\u00ad\ntion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here\nthat called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte\nthat it already explicitly rejected.\n   Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre\u00ad\nsent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth\nCircuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393\nF. 3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which\nprecedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as\u00ad\nserts the Ninth Circuit\u2019s inherent authority to withhold a\nmandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u20133 to A\u20134, 2013 WL\n791610, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,\nsupra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F. 3d 688, 691\u2013\n692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision.\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit\nabused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man\u00ad\ndate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution\n8                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\nissue the mandate immediately and without any further\nproceedings.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n",

The Ninth\nCircuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, \u201cde-\nclin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that\nwould unduly interfere with Arizona\u2019s execution process.\u201d\nOrder in No. 07\u201399005, Doc. 102, p. 1. But instead of\nissuing the mandate, the court decided sua sponte to con\u00ad\nstrue respondent\u2019s motion \u201cas a motion to reconsider our\nprior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Re\u00ad\nmand in light of Martinez,\u201d which the court had denied on\nJuly 27, 2012. Id., at 2. The court ordered briefing and, in\na divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court\nto determine whether respondent could establish that he\nreceived ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un\u00ad\nder Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice\nas a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel had merit.

Arizona set an execution\ndate of March 6, 2013, which prompted respondent to file\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 2 Martinez,566 U. S. 1, was decided on March 20, 2012. We are un\u00ad\naware of any explanation for respondent\u2019s delay in bringing his\nMartinez-based argument to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s attention.\n4                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                         Per Curiam\n\na motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013. The\nNinth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013,\nwith Judge Graber again noting her dissent.\n   On March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing\nand rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit. The court\ndenied the petition the same day, with eight judges dis\u00ad\nsenting in two separate opinions. 709 F. 3d 855 (2013).\n   On March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the\nstay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for\ncertiorari. This Court denied the application, with JUS-\nTICES SCALIA and ALITO noting that they would grant\nit. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We now consider the petition.\n                             II\n   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets\nforth the default rule that \u201c[t]he court of appeals must\nissue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme\nCourt order denying the petition for writ of certiorari\nis filed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is\nstraightforward: \u201c[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely\nto allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio\u00ad\nrari.\u201d Bell, 545 U. S., at 806. Hence, once this Court has\ndenied a petition, there is generally no need for further\naction from the lower courts. See ibid. (\u201c[A] decision by\nthis Court denying discretionary review usually signals\nthe end of litigation\u201d). In Bell, Tennessee argued that\nRule 41(d)(2)(D) \u201cadmits of no exceptions, so the mandate\nshould have issued on the date\u201d the Court of Appeals\nreceived notice of the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari.\nId., at 803. There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell\nbecause we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of\nthe mandate after denial of certiorari. Id., at 803\u2013804. As\nin Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that\nthe Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n   Bell recognized that when state-court judgments are\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                          Per Curiam\n\nreviewed in federal habeas proceedings, \u201cfinality and comity\nconcerns,\u201d based in principles of federalism, demand\nthat federal courts \u201caccord the appropriate level of respect\nto\u201d state judgments by allowing them to be enforced\nwhen federal proceedings conclude. Id., at 812\u2013813.\nAs we noted, States have an \u201c \u2018 \u201cinterest in the finality of\nconvictions that have survived direct review within the\nstate court system.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v.\nThompson, 523 U. S. 538, 555 (1998), in turn quoting\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 635 (1993)). Else\u00ad\nwhere, we explained that \u201c \u2018the profound interests in\nrepose\u2019 attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals\u201d\ndictate that \u201cthe power [to withdraw the mandate] can be\nexercised only in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Calderon,\nsupra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73938, p. 712 (2d\ned. 1996)). Deviation from normal mandate procedures is\na power \u201cof last resort, to be held in reserve against grave,\nunforeseen contingencies.\u201d Calderon, supra, at 550. Even\nassuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it\nabuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate\nonce the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless\nextraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n   Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordi\u00ad\nnary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of\njustice. There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged\nin state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel\nhad been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient\nmitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial. 545\nU. S., at 797. On federal habeas review, he made the\nsame argument. Id., at 798. After the Sixth Circuit af\u00ad\nfirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that\n\u201cplaced substantial emphasis\u201d on his argument that the\nSixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.\nId., at 800. While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it\nstayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant\n6                         RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                             Per Curiam\n\nsought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of\nthe writ. Ibid.\n   When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the\nSixth Circuit did not issue its mandate. Instead, the Sixth\nCircuit waited five months (and until two days before the\nscheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va-\ncated the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas and remanded\nfor an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-\nof-counsel claim. Id., at 800\u2013801. This Court reversed\nthat decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused\nits discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate\nwithout notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously\nrejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federal\u00ad\nism principles.\n   In this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its\ndiscretion when it did not issue the mandate. As in Bell,\nthe Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate\nbased on an argument it had considered and rejected\nmonths earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nFebruary 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had\nbeen over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly\n7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth\nCircuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.3\n   Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented\nin the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to\nthose accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following Febru\u00ad\nary. Respondent styled his July 10 motion a \u201cMotion to\nVacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for\nAdditional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.\u201d No.\n07\u201399005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p. 1. As its title suggests, the\nonly claim presented in that motion was that respondent\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    3 Respondentdid not even present the motion that the Ninth Circuit\nultimately reinstated until more than 4 months after the Ninth Circuit\ndenied respondent\u2019s request for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc\nand more than 3\u00bd months after Martinez was decided.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                           Per Curiam\n\npostconviction counsel should have developed more evi\u00ad\ndence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim. Here, as in Bell, respondent\u2019s July 10 motion\n\u201cpressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted\nby the Court of Appeals.\u201d 545 U. S., at 806. These ar-\nguments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion\nthat \u201c[i]t is difficult to see how . . . counsel could have been\nclearer.\u201d Id., at 808. The Ninth Circuit had a full \u201coppor\u00ad\ntunity to consider these arguments\u201d but declined to do so,\nid., at 806, which \u201csupport[s] our determination that the\ndecision to withhold the mandate was in error.\u201d Id., at\n806\u2013807. We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully\nconsiders each motion a capital defendant presents on\nhabeas review. See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that\n\u201cjudges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of\na petition for rehearing\u201d). As a result, there is no indica\u00ad\ntion that there were any extraordinary circumstances here\nthat called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte\nthat it already explicitly rejected.\n   Finally, this case presents an additional issue not pre\u00ad\nsent in Bell. In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth\nCircuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393\nF. 3d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which\nprecedes our Bell decision by more than six months, as\u00ad\nserts the Ninth Circuit\u2019s inherent authority to withhold a\nmandate. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\u20133 to A\u20134, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">791610</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *1. But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Cir\u00ad\ncuit\u2019s decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee,\nsupra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F. 3d 688, 691\u2013\n692 (2004)). That opinion, thus, provides no support for\nthe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision.\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit\nabused its discretion when it neglected to issue its man\u00ad\ndate. The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\u2019s\nmotion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The\nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution\n8                     RYAN v. SCHAD\n\n                        Per Curiam\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to\nissue the mandate immediately and without any further\nproceedings.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
