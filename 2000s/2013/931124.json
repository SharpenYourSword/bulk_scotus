BARTLETT\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 12\u2013142.      Argued March 19, 2013\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires manufac-\n  turers to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before\n  marketing any brand-name or generic drug in interstate commerce.\n  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(a). Once a drug is approved, a manufacturer is pro-\n  hibited from making any major changes to the \u201cqualitative or quanti-\n  tative formulation of the drug product, including active ingredients,\n  or in the specifications provided in the approved application.\u201d 21\n  CFR \u00a7314.70(b)(2)(i). Generic manufacturers are also prohibited\n  from making any unilateral changes to a drug\u2019s label.               See\n  \u00a7\u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10).\n     In 2004, respondent was prescribed Clinoril, the brand-name ver-\n  sion of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac,\n  for shoulder pain. Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of su-\n  lindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical. Re-\n  spondent soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n  She is now severely disfigured, has physical disabilities, and is nearly\n  blind. At the time of the prescription, sulindac\u2019s label did not specifi-\n  cally refer to toxic epidermal necrolysis. By 2005, however, the FDA\n  had recommended changing all NSAID labeling to contain a more ex-\n  plicit toxic epidermal necrolysis warning. Respondent sued Mutual\n  in New Hampshire state court, and Mutual removed the case to fed-\n  eral court. A jury found Mutual liable on respondent\u2019s design-defect\n  claim and awarded her over $21 million. The First Circuit affirmed.\n  As relevant, it found that neither the FDCA nor the FDA\u2019s regula-\n  tions pre-empted respondent\u2019s design-defect claim. It distinguished\n  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___\u2014in which the Court held that\n  failure-to-warn claims against generic manufacturers are pre-empted\n  by the FDCA\u2019s prohibition on changes to generic drug labels\u2014by ar-\n2          MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                               Syllabus\n\n    guing that generic manufacturers facing design-defect claims could\n    comply with both federal and state law simply by choosing not to\n    make the drug at all.\nHeld: State-law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a\n drug\u2019s warnings are pre-empted by federal law under PLIVA. Pp. 6\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that conflict with fed-\n eral law are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725,\n 746. Even in the absence of an express pre-emption provision, a state\n law may be impliedly pre-empted where it is \u201cimpossible for a private\n party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d English\n v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79. Here, it is impossible for Mu-\n tual to comply with both its federal-law duty not to alter sulindac\u2019s\n label or composition and its state-law duty to either strengthen the\n warnings on sulindac\u2019s label or change sulindac\u2019s design. Pp. 6\u201313.\n      (1) New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action imposes af-\n firmative duties on manufacturers, including a \u201cduty to design [their\n products] reasonably safely for the uses which [they] can foresee.\u201d\n Thibault v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 118 N. H. 802, 809, 395 A. 2d 843,\n 847. Pp. 7\u20138.\n      (2) To assess whether a product\u2019s design is \u201cunreasonably dan-\n gerous to the user,\u201d Vautour v. Body Masters Sports Industries, Inc.,\n 147 N. H. 150, 153, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1181, the New Hampshire Su-\n preme Court employs a \u201crisk-utility approach,\u201d which asks whether\n the danger\u2019s magnitude outweighs the product\u2019s utility, id., at 154,\n 784 A. 2d, at 1182. The court has repeatedly identified three factors\n as germane to that inquiry: \u201cthe usefulness and desirability of the\n product to the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could\n have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product\u2019s\n effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the presence and efficacy of\n a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dan-\n gers or from foreseeable uses.\u201d Ibid. Increasing a drug\u2019s \u201cusefulness\u201d\n or reducing its \u201crisk of danger\u201d would require redesigning the drug,\n since those factors are direct results of a drug\u2019s chemical design and\n active ingredients. Here, however, redesign was not possible for two\n reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same\n active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength,\n and labeling as its brand-name drug equivalent. Second, because of\n sulindac\u2019s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of be-\n ing redesigned. Accordingly, because redesign was impossible, Mu-\n tual could only ameliorate sulindac\u2019s \u201crisk-utility\u201d profile by\n strengthening its warnings. Thus, New Hampshire\u2019s law ultimately\n required Mutual to change sulindac\u2019s labeling.

Accordingly, Mutual was prohibited from taking the remedial\n  action required to avoid liability under New Hampshire law. P. 13.\n       (4) When federal law forbids an action required by state law, the\n  state law is \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland, supra, at 746. Because it\n  was impossible for Mutual to comply with both state and federal law,\n  New Hampshire\u2019s warning-based design-defect cause of action is pre-\n  empted with respect to FDA-approved drugs sold in interstate com-\n  merce. Pp. 13\u201314.\n     (b) The First Circuit\u2019s rationale\u2014that Mutual could escape the im-\n  possibility of complying with both its federal- and state-law duties by\n  choosing to stop selling sulindac\u2014is incompatible with this Court\u2019s\n  pre-emption cases, which have presumed that an actor seeking to sat-\n  isfy both federal- and state-law obligations is not required to cease\n  acting altogether.

KAREN L. BARTLETT \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2013] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We must decide whether federal law pre-empts the New\nHampshire design-defect claim under which respondent\nKaren Bartlett recovered damages from petitioner Mutual\nPharmaceutical, the manufacturer of sulindac, a generic\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).          New\nHampshire law imposes a duty on manufacturers to en-\nsure that the drugs they market are not unreasonably\nunsafe, and a drug\u2019s safety is evaluated by reference to\nboth its chemical properties and the adequacy of its warn-\nings. Because Mutual was unable to change sulindac\u2019s\ncomposition as a matter of both federal law and basic\nchemistry, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action\neffectively required Mutual to change sulindac\u2019s labeling\nto provide stronger warnings. But, as this Court recog-\nnized just two Terms ago in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011), federal law prohibits generic drug manu-\nfacturers from independently changing their drugs\u2019 labels.\nAccordingly, state law imposed a duty on Mutual not to\ncomply with federal law. Under the Supremacy Clause,\nstate laws that require a private party to violate federal\n2       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw are pre-empted and, thus, are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Mary-\nland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 solution\u2014that Mutual should\nsimply have pulled sulindac from the market in order to\ncomply with both state and federal law\u2014is no solution.\nRather, adopting the Court of Appeals\u2019 stop-selling ra-\ntionale would render impossibility pre-emption a dead\nletter and work a revolution in this Court\u2019s pre-emption\ncase law.\n   Accordingly, we hold that state-law design-defect claims\nthat turn on the adequacy of a drug\u2019s warnings are pre-\nempted by federal law under PLIVA. We thus reverse the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals below.\n                              I\n   Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7301 et seq., drug manufacturers must gain approval from\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nbefore marketing any drug in interstate commerce.\n\u00a7355(a). In the case of a new brand-name drug, FDA\napproval can be secured only by submitting a new-drug\napplication (NDA). An NDA is a compilation of materials\nthat must include \u201cfull reports of [all clinical] investiga-\ntions,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(A), relevant nonclinical studies, and \u201cany\nother data or information relevant to an evaluation of the\nsafety and effectiveness of the drug product obtained or\notherwise received by the applicant from any source,\u201d 21\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7314.50(d)(2) and (5)(iv) (2012). The NDA must also\ninclude \u201cthe labeling proposed to be used for such drug,\u201d\n21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(b)(1)(F); 21 CFR \u00a7314.50(c)(2)(i), and \u201ca\ndiscussion of why the [drug\u2019s] benefits exceed the risks\nunder the conditions stated in the labeling,\u201d 21 CFR\n\u00a7314.50(d)(5)(viii); \u00a7314.50(c)(2)(ix). The FDA may ap-\nprove an NDA only if it determines that the drug in\nquestion is \u201csafe for use\u201d under \u201cthe conditions of use pre-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed label-\ning thereof.\u201d 21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(d). In order for the FDA to\nconsider a drug safe, the drug\u2019s \u201cprobable therapeutic\nbenefits must outweigh its risk of harm.\u201d FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U. S. 120, 140 (2000).\n   The process of submitting an NDA is both onerous and\nlengthy. See Report to Congressional Requesters, Gov-\nernment Accountability Office, Nov. 2006, New Drug\nDevelopment, 26 Biotechnology L. Rep. 82, 94 (2007) (A\ntypical NDA spans thousands of pages and is based on\nclinical trials conducted over several years). In order to\nprovide a swifter route for approval of generic drugs,\nCongress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent\nTerm Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585, popularly known\nas the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act.\u201d Under Hatch-Waxman,\na generic drug may be approved without the same level\nof clinical testing required for approval of a new brand-\nname drug, provided the generic drug is identical to\nthe already-approved brand-name drug in several key\nrespects.\n   First, the proposed generic drug must be chemically\nequivalent to the approved brand-name drug: it must have\nthe same \u201cactive ingredient\u201d or \u201cactive ingredients,\u201d \u201croute\nof administration,\u201d \u201cdosage form,\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d as its\nbrand-name counterpart. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii) and\n(iii). Second, a proposed generic must be \u201cbioequivalent\u201d\nto an approved brand-name drug. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(iv). That\nis, it must have the same \u201crate and extent of absorption\u201d\nas the brand-name drug. \u00a7355(j)(8)(B). Third, the generic\ndrug manufacturer must show that \u201cthe labeling proposed\nfor the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for\nthe [approved brand-name] drug.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(v).\n   Once a drug\u2014whether generic or brand-name\u2014is ap-\nproved, the manufacturer is prohibited from making any\nmajor changes to the \u201cqualitative or quantitative formula-\ntion of the drug product, including active ingredients, or in\n4       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe specifications provided in the approved application.\u201d\n21 CFR \u00a7314.70(b)(2)(i). Generic manufacturers are also\nprohibited from making any unilateral changes to a drug\u2019s\nlabel. See \u00a7\u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10) (approval for\na generic drug may be withdrawn if the generic drug\u2019s\nlabel \u201cis no longer consistent with that for [the brand-\nname] drug\u201d).\n                             II\n   In 1978, the FDA approved a nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory pain reliever called \u201csulindac\u201d under the\nbrand name Clinoril. When Clinoril\u2019s patent expired, the\nFDA approved several generic sulindacs, including one\nmanufactured by Mutual Pharmaceutical. 678 F. 3d 30,\n34 (CA1 2012) (case below); App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a\u2013\n145a. In a very small number of patients, NSAIDs\u2014\nincluding both sulindac and popular NSAIDs such as\nibuprofen, naproxen, and Cox2-inhibitors\u2014have the seri-\nous side effect of causing two hypersensitivity skin reac-\ntions characterized by necrosis of the skin and of the\nmucous membranes: toxic epidermal necrolysis, and its\nless severe cousin, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. 678 F. 3d,\nat 34, 43\u201344; Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary\n1872 (31st ed. 2007); Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference 146\u2013147,\n597 (6th ed. 2013); Friedman, Orlet, Still, & Law, Toxic\nEpidermal Necrolysis Due to Administration of Celecobix\n(Celebrex), 95 Southern Medical J. 1213, 1213\u20131214\n(2002).\n   In December 2004, respondent Karen L. Bartlett was\nprescribed Clinoril for shoulder pain. Her pharmacist\ndispensed a generic form of sulindac, which was manufac-\ntured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical. Respondent\nsoon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nThe results were horrific. Sixty to sixty-five percent of\nthe surface of respondent\u2019s body deteriorated, was burned\noff, or turned into an open wound. She spent months in a\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

She is now severely disfigured,\nhas a number of physical disabilities, and is nearly blind.\n  At the time respondent was prescribed sulindac, the\ndrug\u2019s label did not specifically refer to Stevens-Johnson\nSyndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, but did warn\nthat the drug could cause \u201csevere skin reactions\u201d\nand \u201c[f]atalities.\u201d App. 553; 731 F. Supp. 2d 135, 142\n(NH 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). However,\nStevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis\nwere listed as potential adverse reactions on the drug\u2019s\npackage insert. 678 F. 3d, at 36, n. 1. In 2005\u2014once\nrespondent was already suffering from toxic epidermal\nnecrolysis\u2014the FDA completed a \u201ccomprehensive review\nof the risks and benefits, [including the risk of toxic\nepidermal necrolysis], of all approved NSAID products.\u201d\nDecision Letter, FDA Docket No. 2005P-0072/CP1, p. 2\n(June 22, 2006), online at http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/\ndockets/05p0072/05p-0072-pav0001-vol1.pdf (as visited June\n18, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file). As a\nresult of that review, the FDA recommended changes to\nthe labeling of all NSAIDs, including sulindac, to more\nexplicitly warn against toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Respondent\ninitially asserted both failure-to-warn and design-defect\nclaims, but the District Court dismissed her failure-to-\nwarn claim based on her doctor\u2019s \u201cadmi[ssion] that he\nhad not read the box label or insert.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 34.\nAfter a 2-week trial on respondent\u2019s design-defect claim, a\njury found Mutual liable and awarded respondent over\n$21 million in damages.\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed. 678 F. 3d 30.

BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlations pre-empted respondent\u2019s design-defect claims. It\ndistinguished PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___ \u2014in\nwhich the Court held that failure-to-warn claims against\ngeneric manufacturers are pre-empted by the FDCA\u2019s\nprohibition on changes to generic drug labels\u2014by arguing\nthat generic manufacturers facing design-defect claims\ncould simply \u201cchoose not to make the drug at all\u201d and thus\ncomply with both federal and state law. 678 F. 3d, at 37.\nWe granted certiorari. 568 U.

Accordingly, the state law is\npre-empted.\n                                A\n   We begin by identifying petitioner\u2019s duties under state\nlaw. As an initial matter, respondent is wrong in assert-\ning that the purpose of New Hampshire\u2019s design-\ndefect cause of action \u201cis compensatory, not regulatory.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 19. Rather, New Hampshire\u2019s design-\ndefect cause of action imposes affirmative duties on\nmanufacturers.\n   Respondent is correct that New Hampshire has adopted\nthe doctrine of strict liability in tort as set forth in Section\n402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See 2 Re-\nstatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A (1963 and 1964) (here-\ninafter Restatement 2d). See Buttrick v. Arthur Lessard &\nSons, Inc., 110 N. H. 36, 37\u201339, 260 A. 2d 111, 112\u2013113\n(1969). Under the Restatement\u2014and consequently, under\nNew Hampshire tort law\u2014\u201c[o]ne who sells any product in\na defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user\nor consumer or to his property is subject to liability for\nphysical harm thereby caused\u201d even though he \u201chas exer-\ncised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the\nproduct.\u201d Restatement 2d \u00a7402A, at 347\u2013348.\n   But respondent\u2019s argument conflates what we will call a\n\u201cstrict-liability\u201d regime (in which liability does not depend\non negligence, but still signals the breach of a duty) with\nwhat we will call an \u201cabsolute-liability\u201d regime (in which\nliability does not reflect the breach of any duties at all, but\nmerely serves to spread risk). New Hampshire has adopted\nthe former, not the latter. Indeed, the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has consistently held that the manu-\nfacturer of a product has a \u201cduty to design his product\n8          MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

As we have noted, most common-law causes of action for\nnegligence and strict liability do not exist merely to spread risk, but\nrather impose affirmative duties. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552\nU. S. 312, 323\u2013324 (2008) (\u201cIn [Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.

S. ____ (2013)       9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   That New Hampshire tort law imposes a duty on manu-\nfacturers is clear. Determining the content of that duty\nrequires somewhat more analysis. As discussed below in\ngreater detail, New Hampshire requires manufacturers to\nensure that the products they design, manufacture, and\nsell are not \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d The New Hamp-\nshire Supreme Court has recognized that this duty can be\nsatisfied either by changing a drug\u2019s design or by changing\nits labeling. Since Mutual did not have the option of\nchanging sulindac\u2019s design, New Hampshire law ultimately\nrequired it to change sulindac\u2019s labeling.\n   Respondent argues that, even if New Hampshire law\ndoes impose a duty on drug manufacturers, that duty does\nnot encompass either the \u201cduty to change sulindac\u2019s de-\nsign\u201d or the duty \u201cto change sulindac\u2019s labeling.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 30 (capitalization and emphasis deleted).\nThat argument cannot be correct. New Hampshire imposes\ndesign-defect liability only where \u201cthe design of the\nproduct created a defective condition unreasonably dan-\ngerous to the user.\u201d Vautour v. Body Masters Sports In-\ndustries, Inc., 147 N. H. 150, 153, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1181\n(2001); Chellman, supra, at 77, 637 A. 2d, at 150. To\ndetermine whether a product is \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a \u201crisk-\nutility approach\u201d under which \u201ca product is defective as\ndesigned if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the\nutility of the product.\u201d Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d,\nat 1182 (internal quotation marks omitted). That risk-\nutility approach requires a \u201cmultifaceted balancing pro-\ncess involving evaluation of many conflicting factors.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Thi-\nbault, supra, at 809, 395 A. 2d, at 847 (same).\n   While the set of factors to be considered is ultimately an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolated a state-law obligation\u201d).\n10      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nopen one, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has repeat-\nedly identified three factors as germane to the risk-utility\ninquiry: \u201cthe usefulness and desirability of the product to\nthe public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could\nhave been reduced without significantly affecting either\nthe product\u2019s effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the\npresence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasona-\nble risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable\nuses.\u201d Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182; see also\nPrice, supra, at 389, 702 A. 2d, at 333 (same); Chellman,\nsupra, at 77\u201378, 637 A. 2d, at 150 (same).\n   In the drug context, either increasing the \u201cusefulness\u201d of\na product or reducing its \u201crisk of danger\u201d would require\nredesigning the drug: A drug\u2019s usefulness and its risk\nof danger are both direct results of its chemical design\nand, most saliently, its active ingredients. See 21 CFR\n\u00a7201.66(b)(2) (2012) (\u201cActive ingredient means any compo-\nnent that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity\nor other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitiga-\ntion, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the\nstructure of any function of the body of humans\u201d (italics\ndeleted)).\n   In the present case, however, redesign was not possible\nfor two reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug\nto have the same active ingredients, route of adminis-\ntration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as the\nbrand-name drug on which it is based. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(v) and (8)(B); 21 CFR \u00a7320.1(c). Conse-\nquently, the Court of Appeals was correct to recognize that\n\u201cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another composi-\ntion.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 37. Indeed, were Mutual to change the\ncomposition of its sulindac, the altered chemical would be a\nnew drug that would require its own NDA to be marketed\nin interstate commerce. See 21 CFR \u00a7310.3(h) (giving\nexamples of when the FDA considers a drug to be new,\nincluding cases involving \u201cnewness for drug use of any\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstance which composes such drug, in whole or in part\u201d).\nSecond, because of sulindac\u2019s simple composition, the drug\nis chemically incapable of being redesigned. See 678 F. 3d,\nat 37 (\u201cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another\ncomposition (nor it is apparent how it could alter a one-\nmolecule drug anyway)\u201d).\n   Given the impossibility of redesigning sulindac, the only\nway for Mutual to ameliorate the drug\u2019s \u201crisk-utility\u201d\nprofile\u2014and thus to escape liability\u2014was to strengthen\n\u201cthe presence and efficacy of [sulindac\u2019s] warning\u201d in such\na way that the warning \u201cavoid[ed] an unreasonable risk of\nharm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.\u201d\nVautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182. See also\nChellman, 138 N. H., at 78, 637 A. 2d, at 150 (\u201cThe duty to\nwarn is part of the general duty to design, manufacture\nand sell products that are reasonably safe for their fore-\nseeable uses. If the design of a product makes a warning\nnecessary to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a\nforeseeable use, the lack of warning or an ineffective warn-\ning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably\ndangerous\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, New Hampshire\u2019s\ndesign-defect cause of action imposed a duty on Mutual to\nstrengthen sulindac\u2019s warnings.\n   For these reasons, it is unsurprising that allegations\nthat sulindac\u2019s label was inadequate featured prominently\nat trial. Respondent introduced into evidence both the\nlabel for Mutual\u2019s sulindac at the time of her injuries and\nthe label as revised in 2005 (after respondent had suffered\nher injuries). App. 553\u2013556. Her counsel\u2019s opening\nstatement informed the jury that \u201cthe evidence will show\nyou that Sulindac was unreasonably dangerous and had\nan inadequate warning, as well. . . . You will hear much\nmore evidence about why this label was inadequate in\nrelation to this case.\u201d Tr. 110\u2013112 (Aug. 17, 2010). And, the\nDistrict Court repeatedly instructed the jury that it should\nevaluate sulindac\u2019s labeling in determining whether\n12        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nMutual\u2019s sulindac was unreasonably dangerous. See\nApp. 514 (jury instruction that the jury should find \u201ca\ndefect in design\u201d only if it found that \u201cSulindac was unrea-\nsonably dangerous and that a warning was not present\nand effective to avoid that unreasonable danger\u201d); ibid.\n(jury instruction that no design defect exists if \u201ca warning\nwas present and effective to avoid that unreasonable\ndanger\u201d). Finally, the District Court clarified in its order\nand opinion denying Mutual\u2019s motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law that the adequacy of sulindac\u2019s labeling had\nbeen part of what the jury was instructed to consider. 760\nF. Supp. 2d 220, 231 (2011) (\u201cif the jury found that sulin-\ndac\u2019s risks outweighed its benefits, then it could consider\nwhether the warning\u2014regardless of its adequacy\u2014re-\nduced those risks . . . to such an extent that it eliminated\nthe unreasonable danger\u201d).2\n   Thus, in accordance with New Hampshire law, the jury\nwas presented with evidence relevant to, and was in-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 That Mutual\u2019s liability turned on the adequacy of sulindac\u2019s warn-\n\nings is not unusual. Rather, New Hampshire\u2014like a large majority of\nStates\u2014has adopted comment k to \u00a7402A of the Restatement (Second)\nof Torts, which recognizes that it is \u201cespecially common in the field of\ndrugs\u201d for products to be \u201cincapable of being made safe for their intended\nand ordinary use.\u201d Restatement 2d, at 353; Bellotte v. Zayre Corp.,\n116 N. H. 52, 54\u201355, 352 A. 2d 723, 725 (1976). Under comment k,\n\u201c[s]uch a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper\ndirections and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably danger-\nous.\u201d Restatement 2d, at 353\u2013354. This Court has previously noted\nthat, as of 1986, \u201ca large number of courts\u201d took comment k to mean\nthat manufacturers \u201cdid not face strict liability for side effects of\nproperly manufactured prescription drugs that were accompanied by\nadequate warnings.\u201d Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, 562 U.

However, as noted above, both\nrespondent and the trial court injected the broader question of the\nadequacy of sulindac\u2019s label into the trial proceedings.\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

As PLIVA made clear, federal law prevents\ngeneric drug manufacturers from changing their labels.\nSee 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (\u201cFederal drug regula-\ntions, as interpreted by the FDA, prevented the Manufac-\nturers from independently changing their generic drugs\u2019\nsafety labels\u201d).

Thus, federal law prohibited Mutual from taking\nthe remedial action required to avoid liability under New\nHampshire law.\n                           D\n  When federal law forbids an action that state law\nrequires, the state law is \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland,\n451 U.

And, of course, PLIVA,\nInc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), forecloses any argument that\nimpossibility is defeated by the prospect that a manufacturer could\n\u201cpa[y] the state penalty\u201d for violating a state-law duty; that prospect\nwould have defeated impossibility in PLIVA as well. See id., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (\u201c[I]t was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply\nwith both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law\nduty to keep the label the same\u201d).

The misbranding statute requires a manufac-\nturer to pull even an FDA-approved drug from the market when it is\n\u201cdangerous to health\u201d even if \u201cused in the dosage or manner, or with\nthe frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\nlabeling thereof.\u201d 21 U.

The parties and the Government appear to agree that a\ndrug is misbranded under federal law only when liability is based on\nnew and scientifically significant information that was not before the\nFDA. Because the jury was not asked to find whether new evidence\nconcerning sulindac that had not been made available to the FDA\nrendered sulindac so dangerous as to be misbranded under the federal\nmisbranding statute, the misbranding provision is not applicable here.\nCf. 760 F. Supp. 2d 220, 233 (NH 2011) (most of respondent\u2019s experts\u2019\ntestimony was \u201cdrawn directly from the medical literature or published\nFDA analyses\u201d).\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

We reject this \u201cstop-selling\u201d ra-\ntionale as incompatible with our pre-emption jurispru-\ndence. Our pre-emption cases presume that an actor\nseeking to satisfy both his federal- and state-law obliga-\ntions is not required to cease acting altogether in order to\navoid liability. Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act de-\nfeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption\nwould be \u201call but meaningless.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14).\n   The incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain\nwhen viewed through the lens of our previous cases. In\nevery instance in which the Court has found impossibility\npre-emption, the \u201cdirect conflict\u201d between federal- and\nstate-law duties could easily have been avoided if the\nregulated actor had simply ceased acting.\n   PLIVA is an obvious example: As discussed above, the\nPLIVA Court held that state failure-to-warn claims were\npre-empted by the FDCA because it was impossible for\ndrug manufacturers like PLIVA to comply with both the\nstate-law duty to label their products in a way that ren-\ndered them reasonably safe and the federal-law duty not\nto change their drugs\u2019 labels. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). It\nwould, of course, have been possible for drug manufactur-\ners like PLIVA to pull their products from the market\naltogether. In so doing, they would have avoided liability\nunder both state and federal law: such manufacturers\nwould neither have labeled their products in a way that\nrendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any\nfederally approved label.\n   In concluding that \u201cit was impossible for the Manufac-\nturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change\nthe label and their federal law duty to keep the label the\nsame,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Court was unde-\nterred by the prospect that PLIVA could have complied\nwith both state and federal requirements by simply leav-\ning the market. The Court of Appeals decision below had\n16        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that Mensing\u2019s state-law failure-to-warn claims\nescaped pre-emption based on the very same stop-selling\nrationale the First Circuit relied on in this case. See\nMensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (CA8 2009)\n(\u201c[G]eneric defendants were not compelled to market\nmetoclopramide. If they realized their label was insuffi-\ncient . . . they could have simply stopped selling the prod-\nuct\u201d).     Moreover, Mensing advanced the stop-selling\nrationale in its petition for rehearing, which this Court\ndenied. PLIVA, supra; Pet. for Reh\u2019g in No. 09\u2013993 etc.,\np. 2. Nonetheless, this Court squarely determined that it\nhad been \u201cimpossible\u201d for PLIVA to comply with both its\nstate and federal duties. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).5\n   Adopting the First Circuit\u2019s stop-selling rationale would\nmean that not only PLIVA, but also the vast majority\u2014if\nnot all\u2014of the cases in which the Court has found impos-\nsibility pre-emption, were wrongly decided. Just as the\nprospect that a regulated actor could avoid liability under\nboth state and federal law by simply leaving the market\ndid not undermine the impossibility analysis in PLIVA, so\nit is irrelevant to our analysis here.\n                                  V\n     The dreadful injuries from which products liabilities\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Respondent attempts to distinguish this case from PLIVA, arguing\n\nthat \u201c[w]here, as in PLIVA, state law imposes an affirmative duty on a\nmanufacturer to improve the product\u2019s label, suspending sales does not\ncomply with the state-law duty; it merely offers an indirect means of\navoiding liability for noncompliance with that duty.\u201d Brief for Re-\nspondent 39. But that difference is purely semantic: the state-law duty\nin PLIVA to amend metoclopramide\u2019s label could just as easily have\nbeen phrased as a duty not to sell the drug without adequate warnings.\nAt least where a State imposes liability based on a balancing of a\nproduct\u2019s harms and benefits in light of its labeling\u2014rather than\ndirectly prohibiting the product\u2019s sale\u2014the mere fact that a manufac-\nturer may avoid liability by leaving the market does not defeat a claim\nof impossibility.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases arise often engender passionate responses. Today is\nno exception, as JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent (hereinaf-\nter the dissent) illustrates. But sympathy for respondent\ndoes not relieve us of the responsibility of following the\nlaw.\n   The dissent accuses us of incorrectly assuming \u201cthat\nfederal law gives pharmaceutical companies a right to sell\na federally approved drug free from common-law liability,\u201d\npost, at 1, but we make no such assumption. Rather, as\ndiscussed at length above, see supra, at 8\u201313, we hold that\nstate-law design-defect claims like New Hampshire\u2019s that\nplace a duty on manufacturers to render a drug safer by\neither altering its composition or altering its labeling are\nin conflict with federal laws that prohibit manufacturers\nfrom unilaterally altering drug composition or labeling.\nThe dissent is quite correct that federal law establishes no\nsafe-harbor for drug companies\u2014but it does prevent them\nfrom taking certain remedial measures. Where state law\nimposes a duty to take such remedial measures, it \u201cactu-\nal[ly] conflict[s] with federal law\u201d by making it \u201c \u2018impos-\nsible for a private party to comply with both state and\nfederal requirements.\u2019 \u201d Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514\nU. S. 280, 287 (1995) (quoting English, 496 U. S., at 78\u2013\n79). The dissent seems to acknowledge that point when it\nconcedes that, \u201cif federal law requires a particular product\nlabel to include a complete list of ingredients while state\nlaw specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little\nquestion that state law \u2018must yield.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6\u20137 (quoting\nFelder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138 (1988)). What the\ndissent does not see is that that is this case: Federal law\nrequires a very specific label for sulindac, and state law\nforbids the use of that label.\n   The dissent responds that New Hampshire law \u201cmerely\ncreate[s] an incentive\u201d to alter sulindac\u2019s label or composi-\ntion, post, at 7, but does not impose any actual \u201clegal\nobligation,\u201d post, at 13. The contours of that argument are\n18      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifficult to discern. Perhaps the dissent is drawing a\ndistinction between common-law \u201cexposure to liability,\u201d\npost, at 12, and a statutory \u201clegal mandate,\u201d ibid. But the\ndistinction between common law and statutory law is\nirrelevant to the argument at hand: In violating a common-\nlaw duty, as surely as by violating a statutory duty, a\nparty contravenes the law. While it is true that, in a\ncertain sense, common-law duties give a manufacturer the\nchoice \u201cbetween exiting the market or continuing to sell\nwhile knowing it may have to pay compensation to con-\nsumers injured by its product,\u201d post, at 16, statutory\n\u201cmandate[s]\u201d do precisely the same thing: They require a\nmanufacturer to choose between leaving the market and\naccepting the consequences of its actions (in the form of a\nfine or other sanction). See generally Calabresi & Mela-\nmed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability:\nOne View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089 (1972)\n(discussing liability rules). And, in any event, PLIVA\u2014\nwhich the dissent agrees involved a state-law \u201crequire-\nment that conflicted with federal law,\u201d post, at 13\u2014dealt\nwith common-law failure-to-warn claims, see PLIVA,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4). Because PLIVA controls the\ninstant case, the dissent is reduced to fighting a rearguard\naction against its reasoning despite ostensibly swearing\nfealty to its holding.\n   To suggest that Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544\nU. S. 431 (2005), is to the contrary is simply misleading.\nThe dissent is correct that Bates held a Texas state-law\ndesign-defect claim not to be pre-empted. But, it did so\nbecause the design-defect claim in question was not a\n\u201crequirement \u2018for labeling or packaging \u2019 \u201d and thus fell\noutside the class of claims covered by the express pre-\nemption provision at issue in that case. Id., at 443\u2013444\n(emphasis in original). Indeed, contrary to the impression\none might draw from the dissent, post, at 12\u201313, the Bates\nCourt actually blessed the lower court\u2019s determination\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the State\u2019s design-defect claim imposed a pre-\nemptable \u201crequirement\u201d: \u201cThe Court of Appeals did, how-\never, correctly hold that the term \u2018requirements\u2019 in\n\u00a7136v(b) reaches beyond positive enactments, such as\nstatutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties.\u201d\nBates, supra, at 443. The dissent offers no compelling\nreason why the \u201ccommon-law duty\u201d in this case should not\nsimilarly be viewed as a \u201crequirement.\u201d We agree, of\ncourse, that \u201cdetermining precisely what, if any, specific\nrequirement a state common-law claim imposes is im-\nportant.\u201d Post, at 12, n. 5. As Bates makes clear, \u201c[t]he\nproper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of\nthe common-law duty at issue; it does not call for specula-\ntion as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manu-\nfacturer to take any particular action.\u201d 544 U. S., at 445\n(citation omitted). Here, as we have tried to make clear,\nthe duty to ensure that one\u2019s products are not \u201cunreasona-\nbly dangerous\u201d imposed by New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect\ncause of action, Vautour, 147 N. H., at 153, 784 A. 2d, at\n1181, involves a duty to make one of several changes. In\ncases where it is impossible\u2014in fact or by law\u2014to alter a\nproduct\u2019s design (and thus to increase the product\u2019s \u201cuse-\nfulness\u201d or decrease its \u201crisk of danger\u201d), the duty to ren-\nder a product \u201creasonably safe\u201d boils down to a duty to\nensure \u201cthe presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an\nunreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from\nforeseeable uses.\u201d Id., at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182. The\nduty to redesign sulindac\u2019s label was thus a part of the\ncommon-law duty at issue\u2014not merely an action Mutual\nmight have been prompted to take by the adverse jury\nverdict here.\n    Finally, the dissent laments that we have ignored\n\u201cCongress\u2019 explicit efforts to preserve state common-law\nliability.\u201d Post, at 26. We have not. Suffice to say, the\nCourt would welcome Congress\u2019 \u201cexplicit\u201d resolution of the\ndifficult pre-emption questions that arise in the prescrip-\n20      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion drug context. That issue has repeatedly vexed the\nCourt\u2014and produced widely divergent views\u2014in recent\nyears. See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555 (2009);\nPLIVA, 564 U. S. ___. As the dissent concedes, however,\nthe FDCA\u2019s treatment of prescription drugs includes\nneither an express pre-emption clause (as in the vaccine\ncontext, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)), nor an express non-\npre-emption clause (as in the over-the-counter drug con-\ntext, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7379r(e), 379s(d)). In the absence of that\nsort of \u201cexplicit\u201d expression of congressional intent, we are\nleft to divine Congress\u2019 will from the duties the statute\nimposes. That federal law forbids Mutual to take actions\nrequired of it by state tort law evinces an intent to\npre-empt.\n                         *     *     *\n   This case arises out of tragic circumstances. A combina-\ntion of factors combined to produce the rare and devastat-\ning injuries that respondent suffered: the FDA\u2019s decision\nto approve the sale of sulindac and the warnings that\naccompanied the drug at the time it was prescribed, the\ndecision by respondent\u2019s physician to prescribe sulindac\ndespite its known risks, and Congress\u2019 decision to regulate\nthe manufacture and sale of generic drugs in a way that\nreduces their cost to patients but leaves generic drug\nmanufacturers incapable of modifying either the drugs\u2019\ncompositions or their warnings. Respondent\u2019s situation is\ntragic and evokes deep sympathy, but a straightforward\napplication of pre-emption law requires that the judgment\nbelow be reversed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

See post, at 16\u201318 (SOTOMAYOR,\nJ., dissenting). But conflicting state law that requires a\ncompany to withdraw from the State or pay a sizable\ndamages remedy in order to avoid the conflict between\nstate and federal law may nonetheless \u201c \u2018stan[d] as an\nobstacle to the accomplishment\u2019 of \u201d the federal law\u2019s ob-\njective, in which case the relevant state law is pre-empted.\nPost, at 17 (quoting Crosby v.

S. 470, 503 (1996) (opinion concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment), in deciding whether there\nis such a conflict I would pay particular attention to the\nviews of the relevant agency, here the Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA). Where the statute contains no\nclear pre-emption command, courts may infer that the\nadministrative agency has a degree of leeway to determine\nthe extent to which governing statutes, rules, regulations,\n2       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nor other administrative actions have pre-emptive effect.\nSee id., at 505\u2013506 (citing Smiley v. Citibank (South\nDakota), N. A., 517 U.

Cf. Skid-\nmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944). The FDA\nis responsible for administering the relevant federal stat-\nutes. And the question of pre-emption may call for consid-\nerable drug-related expertise. Indeed, one might infer\nthat, the more medically valuable the drug, the less likely\nCongress intended to permit a State to drive it from the\nmarketplace.\n    At the same time, the agency can develop an informed\nposition on the pre-emption question by providing inter-\nested parties with an opportunity to present their views.\nIt can translate its understandings into particular pre-\nemptive intentions accompanying its various rules and\nregulations. And \u201c[i]t can communicate those intentions\n . . . through statements in \u2018regulations, preambles, inter-\npretive statements, and responses to comments.\u2019\u201d Medtronic,\nsupra, at 506 (opinion of BREYER, J.). (quoting Hillsbor-\nough, supra, at 718).\n    Here, however, I cannot give special weight to the FDA\u2019s\nviews. For one thing, as far as the briefing reveals, the\nFDA, in developing its views, has held no hearings on the\nmatter or solicited the opinions, arguments, and views of\nthe public in other ways. For another thing, the FDA\nhas set forth its positions only in briefs filed in litigation,\nnot in regulations, interpretations, or similar agency work\nproduct. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488\nU. S. 204, 212\u2013213 (1988) (\u201c[A]gency litigating positions\nthat are wholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S. 576,\n587 (2000).\n   Finally, the FDA has set forth conflicting views on this\ngeneral matter in different briefs filed at different times.\nCompare Wyeth, supra, at 577, 579, 580, n. 13 (noting that\nthe FDA had previously found no pre-emption, that the\nUnited States now argued for pre-emption, and that this\nnew position was not entitled to deference), with PLIVA,\nInc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 6\u20137, n. 3, 8\u201311) (declining to defer to the\nUnited States\u2019 argument against pre-emption and, instead,\nfinding pre-emption), and with Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313 (now arguing, again, for pre-\nemption). See National Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981\n(2005) (agency views that vary over time are accorded less\nweight); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v.\nState Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 41\u201342\n(1983) (same); Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535\nU. S. 467, 502, n. 20 (2002) (same).\n   Without giving the agency\u2019s views special weight, I\nwould conclude that it is not impossible for petitioner to\ncomply with both state and federal regulatory schemes\nand that the federal regulatory scheme does not pre-empt\nstate common law (read as potentially requiring petitioner\nto pay damages or leave the market). As two former FDA\nCommissioners tell us, the FDA has long believed that\nstate tort litigation can \u201csupplemen[t] the agency\u2019s regula-\ntory and enforcement activities.\u201d Brief for Donald Ken-\nnedy et al. as Amici Curiae 5. See also Wyeth, supra, at 578\n(\u201cIn keeping with Congress\u2019 decision not to pre-empt\ncommon-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA tradition-\nally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug\nregulation\u201d).\n   Moreover, unlike the federal statute at issue in Med-\n4       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntronic, the statute before us contains no general pre-\nemption clause. See 518 U. S., at 481\u2013482. Cf. Wyeth,\nsupra, at 574 (presence of pre-emption clause could show\nthat \u201cCongress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle\nto its objectives\u201d). Furthermore, I have found no con-\nvincing reason to believe that removing this particular\ndrug from New Hampshire\u2019s market, or requiring damage\npayments for it there, would be so harmful that it would\nseriously undercut the purposes of the federal statutory\nscheme. Cf. post, at 21\u201322.\n  Finally, similarly situated defendants in other cases\nremain free to argue for \u201cobstacle pre-emption\u201d in respect\nto damage payments or market withdrawal, and demon-\nstrate the impossibility-of-compliance type of conflict that,\nin their particular cases, might create true incompatibility\nbetween state and federal regulatory schemes.\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Mensing, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), this\nCourt expanded the scope of impossibility pre-emption\nto immunize generic drug manufacturers from state-law\nfailure-to-warn claims. Today, the Court unnecessarily\nand unwisely extends its holding in Mensing to pre-empt\nNew Hampshire\u2019s law governing design-defects with re-\nspect to generic drugs.\n   The Court takes this step by concluding that petitioner\nMutual Pharmaceutical was held liable for a failure-to-\nwarn claim in disguise, even though the District Court\nclearly rejected such a claim and instead allowed liability\non a distinct theory. See infra, at 13\u201315. Of greater con-\nsequence, the Court appears to justify its revision of re-\nspondent Karen Bartlett\u2019s state-law claim through an im-\nplicit and undefended assumption that federal law gives\npharmaceutical companies a right to sell a federally ap-\nproved drug free from common-law liability. Remarkably,\nthe Court derives this proposition from a federal law that,\nin order to protect consumers, prohibits manufacturers\nfrom distributing new drugs in commerce without federal\nregulatory approval, and specifically disavows any intent\nto displace state law absent a direct and positive conflict.\n   Karen Bartlett was grievously injured by a drug that a\n2         MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\njury found was unreasonably dangerous. The jury relied\nupon evidence that the drug posed a higher than normal\nrisk of causing the serious skin reaction that produced\nher horrific injuries; carried other risks; and possessed\nno apparent offsetting benefits compared to similar pain\nrelievers, like aspirin. See 760 F. Supp. 2d 220, 233\u2013241,\n243\u2013244 (NH 2011). The Court laments her \u201ctragic\u201d situa-\ntion, ante, at 20, but responsibility for the fact that Karen\nBartlett has been deprived of a remedy for her injuries\nrests with this Court. If our established pre-emption\nprinciples were properly applied in this case, and if New\nHampshire law were correctly construed, then federal law\nwould pose no barrier to Karen Bartlett\u2019s recovery. I re-\nspectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  I begin with \u201ctwo cornerstones of our pre-emption juris-\nprudence,\u201d Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.

Tracing the history of\nfederal drug regulation from the 1906 Federal Food and\nDrugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, up to the FDCA and its major\namendments, the Court explained that federal drug law\nand state common-law liability have long been understood\nto operate in tandem to promote consumer safety. See\nLevine, 555 U. S., at 566\u2013568, 574. That basic principle,\nwhich the majority opinion elides, is essential to under-\nstanding this case.\n   The FDCA prohibits the \u201cintroduction into interstate\ncommerce [of ] any new drug\u201d without prior approval from\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n21 U.

Under the\nFDCA, manufacturers, who have greater \u201caccess to infor-\nmation about their drugs\u201d than the FDA, Levine, 555\nU. S., at 578\u2013579, retain the ultimate responsibility for\nthe safety of the products they sell. In addition to their\nongoing obligations to monitor a drug\u2019s risks and to report\nadverse drug responses to the FDA, see 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.80,\n314.81, 314.98 (2012), manufacturers may not sell a drug\nthat is \u201cdeemed to be misbranded\u201d because it is \u201cdanger-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nuseful. But the whole point of the presumption against pre-emption is\nthat congressional ambiguity should cut in favor of preserving state\nautonomy. See Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.

Moreover, the FDA, which is tasked with monitor-\ning thousands of drugs on the market and considering new\ndrug applications, faces significant resource constraints\nthat limit its ability to protect the public from dangerous\ndrugs. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 578\u2013579, and n. 11; Brief\nfor Former FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy et al. as\nAmici Curiae 6\u20137, 12\u201320. Tort suits can help fill the gaps\nin federal regulation by \u201cserv[ing] as a catalyst\u201d to identify\npreviously unknown drug dangers. Bates v. Dow Agrosci-\nences LLC, 544 U.

Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64 (2002). While the\nCourt has not always been consistent on this issue, it has\nrepeatedly cautioned against reading federal statutes to\n\u201cremove all means of judicial recourse for those injured\u201d\nwhen Congress did not provide a federal remedy. Silk-\nwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984); see\n6       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ne.g., Bates, 544 U. S., at 449; Lohr, 518 U. S., at 487 (plu-\nrality opinion). And in fact, the legislative history of the\nFDCA suggests that Congress chose not to create a federal\ncause of action for damages precisely because it believed\nthat state tort law would allow injured consumers to\nobtain compensation. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 574\u2013575,\nand n. 7.\n                             II\n  In light of this background, Mutual should face an\nuphill climb to show that federal law pre-empts a New\nHampshire strict-liability claim against a generic drug\nmanufacturer for defective design. The majority neverthe-\nless accepts Mutual\u2019s argument that \u201ccompliance with\nboth federal and state [law was] a physical impossibility.\u201d\nFlorida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S.\n132, 142\u2013143 (1963); see ante, at 7. But if state and fed-\neral law are properly understood, it is clear that New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect claim did not impose a legal\nobligation that Mutual had to violate federal law to satisfy.\n                               A\n  Impossibility pre-emption \u201cis a demanding defense,\u201d Le-\nvine, 555 U. S., at 573, that requires the defendant to\nshow an \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d between federal and state\nlegal obligations, Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 256. The logic\nunderlying true impossibility pre-emption is that when\nstate and federal law impose irreconcilable affirmative\nrequirements, no detailed \u201cinquiry into congressional de-\nsign\u201d is necessary because the inference that Congress\nwould have intended federal law to displace the conflicting\nstate requirement \u201cis inescapable.\u201d Florida Lime, 373\nU. S., at 142\u2013143. So, for example, if federal law requires\na particular product label to include a complete list of\ningredients while state law specifically forbids that label-\ning practice, there is little question that state law \u201cmust\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nyield.\u201d Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138 (1988).\n   The key inquiry for impossibility pre-emption, then, is\nto identify whether state and federal law impose directly\nconflicting affirmative legal obligations such that state law\n\u201crequire[s] the doing of an act which is unlawful under\u201d\nfederal law. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra,\n479 U. S. 272, 292 (1987). Impossibility does not exist\nwhere the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that\nthe laws of the other sovereign restricts or even prohibits.\nSee Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517\nU. S. 25, 31 (1996); Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn.,\nInc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467\nU. S. 461, 478, n. 21 (1984). So, to modify the previous\nexample, if federal law permitted (but did not require)\na labeling practice that state law prohibited, there would\nbe no irreconcilable conflict; a manufacturer could com-\nply with the more stringent regulation. And by the same\nlogic, impossibility does not exist where one sovereign\u2019s\nlaws merely create an incentive to take an action that the\nother sovereign has not authorized because it is possible to\ncomply with both laws.\n   Of course, there are other types of pre-emption. Courts\nmay find that state laws that incentivize what federal law\ndiscourages or forbid what federal law authorizes are pre-\nempted for reasons apart from impossibility: The state\nlaws may fall within the scope of an express pre-emption\nprovision, pose an obstacle to federal purposes and objec-\ntives, or intrude upon a field that Congress intended for\nfederal law to occupy exclusively. See Crosby v. National\nForeign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\u2013373 (2000).\nBut absent a direct conflict between two mutually incom-\npatible legal requirements, there is no impossibility and\ncourts may not automatically assume that Congress in-\ntended for state law to give way. Instead, a more careful\ninquiry into congressional intent is called for, and that\ninquiry should be informed by the presumption against\n8       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npre-emption.\n   In keeping with the strict standard for impossibility,\ncases that actually find pre-emption on that basis are rare.\nSee Abrams, Plenary Power Preemption, 99 Va. L. Rev.\n601, 608 (2013). Mensing is an outlier, as the Court found\nimpossibility because a generic drug manufacturer could\nnot strengthen its product label to come into line with a\nstate-law duty to warn without the exercise of judgment\nby the FDA. See 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201314).\nBut nothing in Mensing, nor any other precedent, dictates\nfinding impossibility pre-emption here.\n                               B\n  To assess whether it is physically impossible for Mutual\nto comply with both federal and state law, it is necessary\nto identify with precision the relevant legal obligations\nimposed under New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of\naction.\n  The majority insists that Mutual was required by New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect law to strengthen its warning\nlabel. In taking this position, the majority effectively re-\ncharacterizes Bartlett\u2019s design-defect claim as a de facto\nfailure-to-warn claim. The majority then relies on that re-\ncharacterization to hold that the jury found Mutual liable\nfor failing to fulfill its duty to label sulindac adequately,\nwhich Mensing forbids because a generic drug manufac-\nturer cannot independently alter its safety label. Ante, at\n13; see Mensing, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). But the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that Mutual was held liable in this\ncase for violating a legal obligation to change its label is\ninconsistent with both New Hampshire state law and the\nrecord.\n  For its part, Mutual, in addition to making the argu-\nment now embraced by the majority, contends that New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect law effectively required it to\nchange the chemical composition of sulindac. Mutual\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nclaims that it was physically impossible to comply with\nthat duty consistent with federal law because drug manu-\nfacturers may not change the chemical composition of\ntheir products so as to create new drugs without submit-\nting a new drug application for FDA approval. See 21\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7310.3(h), 314.70(b)(2)(i). But just as New Hamp-\nshire\u2019s design-defect law did not impose a legal obligation\nfor Mutual to change its label, it also did not mandate that\nMutual change the drug\u2019s design.\n                                1\n                                a\n   Following blackletter products liability law under \u00a7402A\nof the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1963\u20131964) (herein-\nafter Second Restatement), New Hampshire recognizes\nstrict liability for three different types of product defects:\nmanufacturing defects, design defects, and warning de-\nfects. See Cheshire Medical Center v. W. R. Grace & Co.,\n49 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA1 1995). Because the District Court\ngranted Mutual summary judgment on Bartlett\u2019s failure-\nto-warn claim, only New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause\nof action remains at issue in this case.\n   A product has a defective design under New Hampshire\nlaw if it \u201cposes unreasonable dangers to consumers.\u201d\nThibault v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 118 N. H. 802, 807, 395\nA. 2d 843, 846 (1978). To determine whether a product is\nunreasonably dangerous, a jury is asked to make a risk-\nbenefit assessment by considering a nonexhaustive list\nof factors. See ante, at 9\u201310. In addition, New Hamp-\nshire has specifically rejected the doctrine, advocated by\nthe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72(b)\n(1997) (hereinafter Third Restatement), that a plaintiff\nmust present evidence of a reasonable alternative design\nto show that a product\u2019s design is defective. Instead,\n\u201cwhile proof of an alternative design is relevant in a de-\nsign defect case,\u201d it is \u201cneither a controlling factor nor an\n10        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nessential element.\u201d Vautour v. Body Masters Sports In-\ndustries, Inc., 147 N. H. 150, 156, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1183\n(2001).\n   While some jurisdictions have declined to apply design-\ndefect liability to prescription drugs, New Hampshire, in\ncommon with many other jurisdictions, does subject pre-\nscriptions drugs to this distinct form of strict products\nliability. See 678 F. 3d 30, 35 (CA1 2012) (citing Brochu v.\nOrtho Pharmaceutical Corp., 642 F. 2d 652, 655 (CA1\n1981)); see also Third Restatement \u00a76, Comment f (collect-\ning cases from other jurisdictions). Drug manufacturers in\nNew Hampshire have an affirmative defense under com-\nment k to \u00a7402A of the Second Restatement, which ex-\nempts \u201c[u]navoidably unsafe products\u201d from strict liability\nif the product is properly manufactured and labeled. As\nexplained by the lower courts in this case, see 678 F. 3d, at\n36; 731 F. Supp. 2d 135, 150\u2013151 (NH 2010), New Hamp-\nshire takes a case-by-case approach to comment k under\nwhich a defendant seeking to invoke the defense must first\nshow that the product is highly useful and that the dan-\nger imposed by the product could not have been avoided\nthrough a feasible alternative design. See Brochu, 642\nF. 2d, at 657. Comment k did not factor into the jury\u2019s\nassessment of liability in this case because Mutual aban-\ndoned a comment k defense before trial. Ante, at 12, n. 2.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Though the majority does not rely on comment k to find pre-\n\nemption, it misleadingly implies that New Hampshire, like \u201ca large\nmajority of States,\u201d has applied comment k categorically to prescription\ndrugs to exempt manufacturers from \u201c \u2018strict liability for side effects of\nproperly manufactured prescription drugs that [are] accompanied by ade-\nquate warnings.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12, n. 2 (quoting Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC,\n562 U. S. ___, ___, n. 41 (2011) (slip op., at 10, n. 41). That is in-\ncorrect. The majority also neglects to mention that while some courts\nhave applied comment k categorically to prescription drug designs,\n\u201c[m]ost courts have stated that there is no justification for giving all\nprescription drug manufacturers blanket immunity from strict liability\nunder comment k.\u201d 2 American Law of Products Liability 3d \u00a717.45,\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

Specifically, and contrary to the majority, see ante,\nat 11, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law did not require\nMutual to change its warning label. A drug\u2019s warning\nlabel is just one factor in a nonexclusive list for evaluating\nwhether a drug is unreasonably dangerous, see Vautour,\n147 N. H., at 156, 784 A. 2d, at 1183, and an adequate\nlabel is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient con-\ndition for avoiding design-defect liability. Likewise, New\nHampshire law imposed no duty on Mutual to change\nsulindac\u2019s chemical composition. The New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has held that proof of an alternative fea-\nsible design is not an element of a design-defect claim, see\nKelleher v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., 152 N. H. 813,\n831, 891 A. 2d 477, 492 (2006), and as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 11, sulindac was not realistically capable of\nbeing redesigned anyway because it is a single-molecule\ndrug.4\n   To be sure, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect claim cre-\nates an incentive for drug manufacturers to make changes\nto its product, including to the drug\u2019s label, to try to avoid\nliability. And respondent overstates her case somewhat\nwhen she suggests that New Hampshire\u2019s strict-liability\nlaw is purely compensatory. See Brief for Respondent 19.\nAs is typically true of strict-liability regimes, New Hamp-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\np. 108 (2010). Like New Hampshire courts, these courts apply comment k\non a case-by-case basis. See 1 L. Frumer & M. Friedman, Products\nLiability \u00a78.07[5], pp. 8\u2013287 to 8\u2013293 (2012).\n   4 Because of this feature of New Hampshire law, it is unnecessary to\n\nconsider whether the pre-emption analysis would differ in a jurisdiction\nthat required proof of a feasible alternative design as an element of\nliability.\n12        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nshire\u2019s law, which mandates compensation only for \u201cdefec-\ntive\u201d products, serves both compensatory and regulatory\npurposes. See Heath v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 123 N. H.\n512, 521\u2013522, 464 A. 2d 288, 293 (1983). But exposure to\nliability, and the \u201cincidental regulatory effects\u201d that flow\nfrom that exposure, Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486\nU. S. 174, 185\u2013186 (1988), is not equivalent to a legal\nmandate for a regulated party to take (or refrain from\ntaking) a specific action. This difference is a significant\none: A mandate leaves no choice for a party that wishes to\ncomply with the law, whereas an incentive may only influ-\nence a choice.\n   Our cases reflect this distinction. In Bates, for exam-\nple, we rejected an argument that design-defect claims\nbrought against a pesticide manufacturer were pre-empted\nbecause they would likely \u201cinduce\u201d the manufacturer to\nchange its product label and thus run afoul of an express\npre-emption provision forbidding state labeling \u201crequire-\nments\u201d that were different or in addition to federal re-\nquirements. 544 U. S., at 444\u2013446. A requirement, we\nexplained, \u201cis a rule of law that must be obeyed.\u201d Id., at\n445. \u201c[A]n event, such as a jury verdict, that merely moti-\nvates an optional decision,\u201d does not rise to that level.\nIbid.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority suggests my account of Bates is \u201csimply misleading,\u201d\n\nante, at 18, but it simply misses the point. I recognize that, under the\nCourt\u2019s precedents, common-law duties may qualify as \u201crequirements,\u201d\nat least as that term has been used in express pre-emption provisions\nin federal law. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 323\u2013324\n(2008). But determining precisely what, if any, specific requirement a\nstate common-law claim imposes is important. In Bates, the lower\ncourt had accepted the same basic argument that the majority advances\nhere: that the plaintiffs\u2019 design-defect claim that a pesticide was \u201cun-\nreasonably dangerous\u201d was \u201cmerely a disguised claim for failure to\nwarn\u201d because success on the claim that the pesticide was dangerous to\ncrops in soil above a certain pH level would \u201cnecessarily induce\u201d a\nmanufacturer to change its product\u2019s label to avoid liability. Dow\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   13\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  So too here. The fact that imposing strict liability for\ninjuries caused by a defective drug design might make a\ndrug manufacturer want to change its label or design (or\nboth) does not mean the manufacturer was actually re-\nquired by state law to take either action. And absent such\na legal obligation, the majority\u2019s impossibility argument\ndoes not get off the ground, because there was no state\nrequirement that it was physically impossible for Mutual\nto comply with while also following federal law. The case\nis therefore unlike Mensing, where it was \u201cundisputed\u201d\nthat applicable state tort law \u201crequire[d] a drug manufac-\nturer that is or should be aware of its product\u2019s danger\u201d to\nstrengthen its label\u2014a requirement that conflicted with\nfederal law preventing the manufacturer from doing so uni-\nlaterally, 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 4, 11\u201312).\nNew Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law did not require Mu-\ntual to do anything other than to compensate consumers\nwho were injured by an unreasonably dangerous drug.\n                               2\n  Moreover, the trial record in this case confirms that, con-\ntrary to the majority\u2019s insistence, Mutual was not held liable\nfor \u201cbreach[ing] [its] duty\u201d \u201cto label sulindac adequately.\u201d\nAnte, at 13.\n  When Bartlett filed suit against Mutual, she raised\ndistinct claims based on design defect and failure to warn.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAgrosciences LLC v.

This\nCourt explicitly rejected the notion that because design-defect liability\nmight lead a manufacturer to make a label change, it meant that the\nState\u2019s design-defect claim imposed a requirement for labeling or\npackaging. See 544 U. S., at 445\u2013446. The majority contends that this\ncase is different because the duty to redesign sulindac\u2019s label was an\nelement of New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law. Ante, at 19. But it is\nnot. See supra, at 11. Rather, altering a product label is merely one\nstep a manufacturer might take to prevent its product from being\nconsidered unreasonably dangerous, and it is a step that New Hamp-\nshire law recognizes may be insufficient.

Supp. 2d 279, 282 (NH 2009).\nPursuing both claims was consistent with New Hampshire\nlaw\u2019s recognition that \u201cdesign defect and failure to warn\nclaims are separate.\u201d LeBlanc v. American Honda Motor\nCo., 141 N. H. 579, 586, 688 A. 2d 556, 562 (1997). After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment to Mutual\non the failure-to-warn claim, the court repeatedly ex-\nplained that an alleged failure to warn by Mutual could\nnot and did not provide the basis for Bartlett\u2019s recovery.\nSee 760 F. Supp. 2d, at 248\u2013249.6\n  The majority notes that the District Court admitted\nevidence regarding sulindac\u2019s label. Ante, at 11\u201312. But\nthe court did so because the label remained relevant for\nthe more limited purpose of assessing, in combination\nwith other factors, whether sulindac\u2019s design was defective\nbecause the product was unreasonably dangerous. See\n678 F. 3d, at 41. The District Court\u2019s instructions to the\njury adhered to this limited purpose. The court first told\nthe jury to determine whether sulindac was unreasonably\ndangerous by weighing its danger against its utility. App.\n513. The court further instructed the jury that if it deter-\nmined that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous without\nreference to the warning label, it could then consider the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, in a ruling on proposed jury instructions, the District\n\nCourt made clear that \u201cBartlett cannot be allowed to circumvent this\ncourt\u2019s summary judgment ruling by using Sulindac\u2019s warning to\nestablish that the drug is unreasonably dangerous (i.e., arguing that\nSulindac is unreasonably dangerous because of its warning), where this\ncourt has already ruled that any inadequacy in the warning did not\ncause Bartlett\u2019s injuries.\u201d App. 343. Doing so, the court explained\n\u201cwould effectively turn this case back into a failure-to-warn case,\nrendering the summary judgment ruling meaningless.\u201d Ibid.\n  The District Court later told counsel that it had removed a failure-to-\nwarn instruction from the jury instructions because \u201c[t]his is not a\nfailure to warn case,\u201d and the court admonished counsel to \u201ctread care-\nfully\u201d in arguing about the warning label because the label\u2019s adequacy\nwas \u201cnot an issue before this jury.\u201d Id., at 496.\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

In other words, to hold Mutual liable,\nthe jury was required to find that sulindac \u201cwas unreason-\nably dangerous despite its warning, not because of it.\u201d Id.,\nat 341. The District Court also explained to the jury that\nbecause Bartlett\u2019s claim addressed only whether sulindac\u2019s\ndesign was defective, Mutual\u2019s conduct, \u201cwhich included\nany failure to change its warning, was \u2018not relevant to this\ncase.\u2019 \u201d 760 F. Supp. 2d, at 248.\n   The distinction drawn by the District Court between\npermissible and impermissible uses of evidence regarding\nsulindac\u2019s label is faithful to New Hampshire law. That\nlaw recognizes that the effectiveness of a warning label\nis just one relevant factor in determining whether a prod-\nuct\u2019s design is unreasonably dangerous, and that design-\ndefect and failure-to-warn claims are \u201cseparate.\u201d LeBlanc,\n141 N. H., at 586, 688 A. 2d, at 562.7 In short, as the\nDistrict Court made clear, Mutual was not held liable for\n\u201cfailing to change\u201d its warning. 760 F. Supp., at 248\u2013249.\n                              C\n  Given the distinction that New Hampshire draws be-\ntween failure-to-warn claims and design-defect claims, as\nwell as the clear and repeated statements by the trial\njudge that Mutual\u2019s liability was not predicated on breach-\ning a duty to label sulindac adequately, on what basis does\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 To the extent the majority believes that the District Court in prac-\n\ntice allowed the adequacy of the warning label to play a greater role\nat trial than it should have, see ante, at 11\u201312, that is irrelevant to the\nquestion before the Court. Statements by counsel, even if improper, do\nnot change the state law cause of action that we evaluate for pre-\nemption purposes. And the Court of Appeals specifically concluded that\nthe District Court\u2019s jury instructions were appropriate and that \u201c[i]f\nMutual wanted a further caution in the instructions\u201d concerning its\nwarning label, then Mutual \u201cshould have sought it.\u201d 678 F. 3d 30, 41\u2013\n42 (CA1 2012).\n16        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe majority reach a contrary conclusion? Though the\nmajority insists otherwise, ante, at 17, it appears to rely\nprincipally on an implicit assumption about rights con-\nferred by federal premarket approval under the FDCA.\nAfter correctly observing that changing sulindac\u2019s chemi-\ncal composition would create a new drug that would have\nto go through its own approval process, the majority rea-\nsons that Mutual must have been under a state-law duty\nto change its label because it had no other option to avoid\nliability while continuing to sell its product. Ante, at 10\u2013\n11. But that conclusion is based on a false premise.\n   A manufacturer of a drug that is unreasonably danger-\nous under New Hampshire law has multiple options: It\ncan change the drug\u2019s design or label in an effort to alter\nits risk-benefit profile, remove the drug from the market,\nor pay compensation as a cost of doing business. If federal\nlaw or the drug\u2019s chemical properties take the redesign\noption off the table, then that does not mean the manufac-\nturer suddenly has a legal obligation under state law to\nimprove the drug\u2019s label. Indeed, such a view of state law\nmakes very little sense here because even if Mutual had\nstrengthened its label to fully account for sulindac\u2019s risks,\nthe company might still have faced liability for having\na defective design. See Thibault, 118 N. H., at 808, 395\nA. 2d, at 847 (explaining that strict liability \u201cmay attach\neven though . . . there was an adequate warning\u201d). When\na manufacturer cannot change the label or when doing so\nwould not make the drug safe, the manufacturer may still\nchoose between exiting the market or continuing to sell\nwhile knowing it may have to pay compensation to con-\nsumers injured by its product.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The majority\u2019s suggestion that a manufacturer\u2019s option of continuing\n\nto sell while paying compensation is akin to violating a statutory\nmandate and then suffering the consequence (such as paying a fine) is\nflawed. See ante, at 18. In that scenario, the manufacturer would have\nviolated the law, and the fact that the law is enforced through mone-\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

But it is a choice that a sovereign\nState may impose to protect its citizens from dangerous\ndrugs or at least ensure that seriously injured consumers\nreceive compensation. That is, a State may impose such a\nchoice unless the FDCA gives manufacturers an absolute\nright to sell their products free from common-law liability,\nor state law otherwise \u201cstands as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment\u201d of federal objectives. Crosby, 530 U. S., at\n373 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the\nmajority does not rely on obstacle pre-emption, it must\nbelieve that a manufacturer that received FDA premarket\napproval has a right not only to keep its drug on the mar-\nket unless and until the FDA revokes approval, but also to\nbe free from state-law liability that makes doing so more\nexpensive. That proposition is fundamentally inconsistent\nwith the FDCA\u2019s text, structure, saving clause, and his-\ntory. See supra, at 3\u20136; Levine, 555 U. S., at 583 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   It is simply incorrect to say that federal law presupposes\nthat drug manufacturers have a right to continue to sell a\ndrug free from liability once it has been approved. Noth-\ning in the language of the FDCA, which is framed as a\nprohibition on distribution without FDA approval, see 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7355(a), suggests such a right. Federal law itself\nbars the sale of previously approved drugs if new infor-\nmation comes to light demonstrating that the drug is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntary sanctions (rather than through an injunction or imprisonment)\nwould not change that. Here, no matter how many times the majority\ninsists otherwise, ibid., a manufacturer who sells a drug whose design\nis found unreasonably dangerous based on a balance of factors has not\nviolated a state law requiring it to change its label. In both cases, the\nmanufacturer may owe money. But only in the former will it have\nfailed to follow the law. Cf. National Federation of Independent Busi-\nness v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. __, __ (2012) (slip op., at 32) (recognizing that\na condition that triggers a tax is not necessarily a \u201clegal command\u201d to\ntake a certain action).\n18        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

See U. S. Brief 5.\n   New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action thus\ndoes no more than provide an impetus for an action that is\npermitted and sometimes encouraged or even required by\nfederal law.\n                               D\n  The majority derides any suggestion that Mutual\u2019s\nability to \u201cstop selling\u201d sulindac is relevant to the validity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority properly leaves open the question whether state de-\n\nsign-defect claims that parallel the federal misbranding statute are pre-\nempted. See ante, at 14, n. 4. The majority fails to appreciate, however,\nthat this statute undermines its impossibility argument (as compared\nto an argument based on obstacle pre-emption) because it shows that\nthere is no federal right or obligation to continue to sell a drug like\nsulindac that was previously approved. In fact, the statute demon-\nstrates that sometimes a drug manufacturer like Mutual may have a\nfederal duty not to sell its drug.\n  10 See Government Accountability Office, Drug Safety: Improvement\n\nNeeded in FDA\u2019s Postmarket Decision-making and Oversight Process\n10 (GAO\u201306\u2013402, 2006) (noting that 10 drugs were voluntarily with-\ndrawn for safety reasons between 2000 and 2006); Wysowski & Swartz,\nAdverse Drug Event Surveillance and Drug Withdrawals in the United\nStates, 1969\u20132002, 165 Archives Internal Med. 1363 (2005) (noting that\nmore than 75 drugs and drug products were withdrawn from the\nmarket for safety reasons between 1969 and 2002).\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Ante, at 2, 14\u201316.\nBut the majority\u2019s argument is built on the mistaken\npremise that Mutual is legally obligated by New Hamp-\nshire\u2019s design-defect law to modify its label in a way that\nfederal law forbids. It is not. See supra, at 11\u201313. For\nthat reason, rejecting impossibility pre-emption here would\nnot render the doctrine \u201ca dead letter\u201d or \u201c \u2018all but mean-\ningless.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2, 15 (quoting Mensing, 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 14)). On the other hand, it is the major-\nity that \u201cwork[s] a revolution in this Court\u2019s [impossibility]\npre-emption case law,\u201d ante, at 2, by inferring a state-law\nrequirement from the steps a manufacturer might wish to\ntake to avoid or mitigate its exposure to liability.\n   Not all products can be made safe for sale with an im-\nproved warning or a tweak in design. New Hampshire,\nthrough its design-defect law, has made a judgment that\nsome drugs that were initially approved for distribution\nturn out to be inherently and unreasonably dangerous\nand should therefore not be sold unless the manufacturer\nis willing to compensate injured consumers. Congressional\nintent to pre-empt such a cause of action cannot be\ngleaned from the existence of federal specifications that\napply to the product if it is sold. Instead, whether New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect cause-of-action is pre-empted\ndepends on assessing whether it poses an obstacle to a\nfederal policy to approve sulindac for use. Yet the major-\nity skips that analysis and instead finds impossibility\nwhere it does not exist by relying on a question-begging\nassumption that Congress intended for Mutual to have a\nway to continue selling sulindac without incurring com-\nmon-law liability. See ante, at 9\u201311.\n   The distinction between impossibility and obstacle pre-\nemption is an important one. While obstacle pre-emption\ncan be abused when courts apply an overly broad concep-\ntion of the relevant federal purpose to find pre-emption,\nsee Levine, 555 U. S., at 601\u2013602 (THOMAS, J., concurring\n20        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin judgment), it is a useful framework for a case like this\none because it would at least lead the Court to ask the\nright questions.\n   For example, properly evaluating the asserted conflict\nhere through the lens of obstacle pre-emption would allow\nthe Court to consider evidence about whether Congress\nintended the FDA to make an optimal safety determina-\ntion and set a maximum safety standard (in which case\nstate tort law would undermine the purpose) rather than\na minimal safety threshold (in which case state tort\nlaw could supplement it). See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda\nMotor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 11). By contrast, the majority\u2019s overbroad impossibility\nframework takes no account of how federal drug safety\nreview actually works. Though the majority gestures to\nthe rigorous nature of the FDA\u2019s review of new drug ap-\nplications, ante, at 2\u20133, nothing in the majority\u2019s reason-\ning turns on how the FDA\u2019s premarketing review operates\nor on the agency\u2019s capacity to engage in postmarketing\nreview.\n   In taking the approach it does, the majority replaces\ncareful assessment of regulatory structure with an ipse\ndixit that pharmaceutical companies must have a way to\n\u201cescape liability,\u201d ante, at 11, while continuing to sell a\ndrug that received FDA approval. As a result, the major-\nity effectively makes a highly contested policy judgment\nabout the relationship between FDA review and state tort\nlaw\u2014treating the FDA as the sole guardian of drug\nsafety\u2014without defending its judgment and without con-\nsidering whether that is the policy judgment that Congress\nmade.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Defending a policy judgment that treats the FDA as the exclusive\n\nguarantor of drug safety would be no easy task in light of evidence that\nresource constraints and gaps in legal authority, among other factors,\nlimit the agency\u2019s ability to safeguard public health.

The FDA, through an amicus brief filed by the\nUnited States, generally supports this argument. The\nFDA states that the question whether a design-defect\nclaim12 is pre-empted is \u201cdifficult and close,\u201d and it recog-\nnizes that \u201c[s]everal factors do weigh in favor of finding no\npreemption,\u201d including the absence of textual support in\nthe FDCA for the idea that an approved drug must be\nmade available in any particular State. See U. S. Brief\n12, 21\u201322. But the FDA ultimately contends that design-\ndefect claims are pre-empted unless they parallel the\nFDCA\u2019s misbranding prohibition because the agency be-\nlieves that permitting juries to balance the health risks\nand benefits of an FDA-approved drug would undermine\nthe FDA\u2019s drug-safety determinations and could reduce\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFailure-to-Warn Claims, 96 Geo.

This assumption, it seems, will\nalways create an automatic conflict between a federal\npremarket review requirement and state-law design-defect\nliability because premarket review, by definition, prevents\nmanufacturers from unilaterally changing their products\u2019\ndesigns.14 That is true, for example, of the designs (i.e.,\nthe chemical composition) of brand-name drugs under\nthe FDCA no less than it is for generic drugs. See ante, at\n3\u20134.\n   If the creation of such an automatic conflict is the ulti-\nmate end-point of the majority\u2019s continued expansion of\nimpossibility pre-emption, then the result is frankly aston-\nishing. Congress adopted the FDCA\u2019s premarketing ap-\nproval requirement in 1938 and then strengthened it in\n1962 in response to serious public-health episodes involv-\ning unsafe drugs. See Future of Drug Safety 152. Yet by\nthe majority\u2019s lights, the very act of creating that re-\nquirement in order to \u201csafeguard the consumer,\u201d United\nStates v. Sullivan, 332 U. S. 689, 696 (1948), also created\nby operation of law a shield for drug manufacturers to\navoid paying common-law damages under state laws that\nare also designed to protect consumers. That is so not-\nwithstanding Congress\u2019 effort to disclaim any intent to\npre-empt all state law. See supra, at 4. The majority\u2019s\nreasoning thus \u201chas the \u2018perverse effect\u2019 of granting broad\nimmunity \u2018to an entire industry that, in the judgment of\nCongress, needed more stringent regulation.\u2019 \u201d Riegel, 552\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Or at least it creates an automatic conflict with the caveat that\n\ndesign-defect claims that parallel a federal duty for manufacturers to\nwithdraw a product might not be pre-empted.

See, e.g., Riegel, 552 U. S., at 323\u2013\n325; see supra, at 4, and n. 2. In other instances, such as\nwith prescription drugs, it has not. Under the majority\u2019s\napproach, it appears that design-defect claims are categor-\nically displaced either way, and Congress\u2019 efforts to set the\nboundaries of pre-emption more precisely were largely\nacademic. This could have serious consequences for prod-\nuct safety. State design-defect laws play an important role\nnot only in discovering risks, but also in providing in-\ncentives for manufacturers to remove dangerous products\nfrom the market promptly. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 578\u2013\n579; Bates, 544 U. S., at 451; see also Conk, Is There a\nDesign Defect in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Prod-\nucts Liability? 109 Yale L. J. 1087, 1130 (2000) (\u201cThe tort\nsystem can encourage FDA regulatory vigor and compe-\ntence\u201d). If manufacturers of products that require preap-\nproval are given de facto immunity from design-defect\nliability, then the public will have to rely exclusively on\nimperfect federal agencies with limited resources and\nsometimes limited legal authority to recall approved prod-\nucts. And consumers injured by those products will have\nno recourse.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a7136a (pesticides); 21 U. S.

Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 1). In 1986, in response to a rise in tort suits that\nproduced instability in the vaccine market, Congress\nenacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Vac-\ncine Act), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1). The Act established\na no-fault compensation program funded through an\nexcise tax on vaccines to compensate individuals injured\nor killed by vaccine side effects. \u201cThe quid pro quo for\nthis\u201d system, the Court stated in Bruesewitz, \u201cwas the\nprovision of significant tort-liability protections for vaccine\nmanufacturers.\u201d 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n  While Members of this Court disagreed on the scope of\nthe tort protections the Vaccine Act was intended to offer,\nthe Act\u2019s history demonstrates that Congress is perfectly\ncapable of responding when it believes state tort law may\ncompromise significant federal objectives under a scheme\nof premarket regulatory review for products it wants to\nmake available. And it illustrates that \u201can important\nreason to require that preemption decisions be made by\nCongress,\u201d rather than by courts on the basis of an ex-\npanded implied pre-emption doctrine, is Congress\u2019 ability\nto tie its pre-emption decisions \u201cto some alternative means\nfor securing compensation.\u201d Metzger, Federalism and Fed-\neral Agency Reform, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 33 (2011).\nBy instead reaching out to find pre-emption in a context\nwhere Congress never intended it, the majority leaves\nconsumers like Karen Bartlett to bear enormous losses on\ntheir own.\n26      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                          *  *     *\n   The Court recognizes that \u201c[t]his case arises out of\ntragic circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 20. And I do not doubt\nthat Members of the majority personally feel sympathy for\nKaren Bartlett. But the Court\u2019s solemn affirmation that\nit merely discharges its duty to \u201cfollo[w] the law,\u201d ante, at\n17, and gives effect to Congress\u2019 policy judgment, rather\nthan its own, is hard to accept. By once again expanding\nthe scope of impossibility pre-emption, the Court turns\nCongress\u2019 intent on its head and arrives at a holding that\nis irreconcilable with our precedents. As a result, the\nCourt has left a seriously injured consumer without any\nremedy despite Congress\u2019 explicit efforts to preserve state\ncommon-law liability.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n",

Argued March 19, 2013\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) requires manufac-\n  turers to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before\n  marketing any brand-name or generic drug in interstate commerce.\n  21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(a). Once a drug is approved, a manufacturer is pro-\n  hibited from making any major changes to the \u201cqualitative or quanti-\n  tative formulation of the drug product, including active ingredients,\n  or in the specifications provided in the approved application.\u201d 21\n  CFR \u00a7314.70(b)(2)(i). Generic manufacturers are also prohibited\n  from making any unilateral changes to a drug\u2019s label.               See\n  \u00a7\u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10).\n     In 2004, respondent was prescribed Clinoril, the brand-name ver-\n  sion of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac,\n  for shoulder pain. Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of su-\n  lindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical. Re-\n  spondent soon developed an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n  She is now severely disfigured, has physical disabilities, and is nearly\n  blind. At the time of the prescription, sulindac\u2019s label did not specifi-\n  cally refer to toxic epidermal necrolysis. By 2005, however, the FDA\n  had recommended changing all NSAID labeling to contain a more ex-\n  plicit toxic epidermal necrolysis warning. Respondent sued Mutual\n  in New Hampshire state court, and Mutual removed the case to fed-\n  eral court. A jury found Mutual liable on respondent\u2019s design-defect\n  claim and awarded her over $21 million. The First Circuit affirmed.\n  As relevant, it found that neither the FDCA nor the FDA\u2019s regula-\n  tions pre-empted respondent\u2019s design-defect claim. It distinguished\n  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___\u2014in which the Court held that\n  failure-to-warn claims against generic manufacturers are pre-empted\n  by the FDCA\u2019s prohibition on changes to generic drug labels\u2014by ar-\n2          MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

Pp. 6\u2013\n 20.\n    (a) Under the Supremacy Clause, state laws that conflict with fed-\n eral law are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725,\n 746. Even in the absence of an express pre-emption provision, a state\n law may be impliedly pre-empted where it is \u201cimpossible for a private\n party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d English\n v. General Elec. Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79. Here, it is impossible for Mu-\n tual to comply with both its federal-law duty not to alter sulindac\u2019s\n label or composition and its state-law duty to either strengthen the\n warnings on sulindac\u2019s label or change sulindac\u2019s design. Pp. 6\u201313.\n      (1) New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action imposes af-\n firmative duties on manufacturers, including a \u201cduty to design [their\n products] reasonably safely for the uses which [they] can foresee.\u201d\n Thibault v.

Body Masters Sports Industries, Inc.,\n 147 N. H. 150, 153, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1181, the New Hampshire Su-\n preme Court employs a \u201crisk-utility approach,\u201d which asks whether\n the danger\u2019s magnitude outweighs the product\u2019s utility, id., at 154,\n 784 A. 2d, at 1182. The court has repeatedly identified three factors\n as germane to that inquiry: \u201cthe usefulness and desirability of the\n product to the public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could\n have been reduced without significantly affecting either the product\u2019s\n effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the presence and efficacy of\n a warning to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from hidden dan-\n gers or from foreseeable uses.\u201d Ibid. Increasing a drug\u2019s \u201cusefulness\u201d\n or reducing its \u201crisk of danger\u201d would require redesigning the drug,\n since those factors are direct results of a drug\u2019s chemical design and\n active ingredients. Here, however, redesign was not possible for two\n reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same\n active ingredients, route of administration, dosage form, strength,\n and labeling as its brand-name drug equivalent. Second, because of\n sulindac\u2019s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of be-\n ing redesigned. Accordingly, because redesign was impossible, Mu-\n tual could only ameliorate sulindac\u2019s \u201crisk-utility\u201d profile by\n strengthening its warnings. Thus, New Hampshire\u2019s law ultimately\n required Mutual to change sulindac\u2019s labeling.

Accordingly, Mutual was prohibited from taking the remedial\n  action required to avoid liability under New Hampshire law. P. 13.\n       (4) When federal law forbids an action required by state law, the\n  state law is \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Maryland, supra, at 746. Because it\n  was impossible for Mutual to comply with both state and federal law,\n  New Hampshire\u2019s warning-based design-defect cause of action is pre-\n  empted with respect to FDA-approved drugs sold in interstate com-\n  merce.

KAREN L. BARTLETT \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 24, 2013] \n\n\n  JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  We must decide whether federal law pre-empts the New\nHampshire design-defect claim under which respondent\nKaren Bartlett recovered damages from petitioner Mutual\nPharmaceutical, the manufacturer of sulindac, a generic\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).          New\nHampshire law imposes a duty on manufacturers to en-\nsure that the drugs they market are not unreasonably\nunsafe, and a drug\u2019s safety is evaluated by reference to\nboth its chemical properties and the adequacy of its warn-\nings. Because Mutual was unable to change sulindac\u2019s\ncomposition as a matter of both federal law and basic\nchemistry, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action\neffectively required Mutual to change sulindac\u2019s labeling\nto provide stronger warnings. But, as this Court recog-\nnized just two Terms ago in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011), federal law prohibits generic drug manu-\nfacturers from independently changing their drugs\u2019 labels.\nAccordingly, state law imposed a duty on Mutual not to\ncomply with federal law. Under the Supremacy Clause,\nstate laws that require a private party to violate federal\n2       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlaw are pre-empted and, thus, are \u201cwithout effect.\u201d Mary-\nland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 746 (1981).\n   The Court of Appeals\u2019 solution\u2014that Mutual should\nsimply have pulled sulindac from the market in order to\ncomply with both state and federal law\u2014is no solution.\nRather, adopting the Court of Appeals\u2019 stop-selling ra-\ntionale would render impossibility pre-emption a dead\nletter and work a revolution in this Court\u2019s pre-emption\ncase law.\n   Accordingly, we hold that state-law design-defect claims\nthat turn on the adequacy of a drug\u2019s warnings are pre-\nempted by federal law under PLIVA. We thus reverse the\ndecision of the Court of Appeals below.\n                              I\n   Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FDCA), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7301 et seq., drug manufacturers must gain approval from\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nbefore marketing any drug in interstate commerce.\n\u00a7355(a). In the case of a new brand-name drug, FDA\napproval can be secured only by submitting a new-drug\napplication (NDA). An NDA is a compilation of materials\nthat must include \u201cfull reports of [all clinical] investiga-\ntions,\u201d \u00a7355(b)(1)(A), relevant nonclinical studies, and \u201cany\nother data or information relevant to an evaluation of the\nsafety and effectiveness of the drug product obtained or\notherwise received by the applicant from any source,\u201d 21\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7314.50(d)(2) and (5)(iv) (2012). The NDA must also\ninclude \u201cthe labeling proposed to be used for such drug,\u201d\n21 U. S.

S. 120, 140 (2000).\n   The process of submitting an NDA is both onerous and\nlengthy.

Rep. 82, 94 (2007) (A\ntypical NDA spans thousands of pages and is based on\nclinical trials conducted over several years). In order to\nprovide a swifter route for approval of generic drugs,\nCongress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent\nTerm Restoration Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1585, popularly known\nas the \u201cHatch-Waxman Act.\u201d Under Hatch-Waxman,\na generic drug may be approved without the same level\nof clinical testing required for approval of a new brand-\nname drug, provided the generic drug is identical to\nthe already-approved brand-name drug in several key\nrespects.\n   First, the proposed generic drug must be chemically\nequivalent to the approved brand-name drug: it must have\nthe same \u201cactive ingredient\u201d or \u201cactive ingredients,\u201d \u201croute\nof administration,\u201d \u201cdosage form,\u201d and \u201cstrength\u201d as its\nbrand-name counterpart. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii) and\n(iii). Second, a proposed generic must be \u201cbioequivalent\u201d\nto an approved brand-name drug. \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(iv). That\nis, it must have the same \u201crate and extent of absorption\u201d\nas the brand-name drug. \u00a7355(j)(8)(B). Third, the generic\ndrug manufacturer must show that \u201cthe labeling proposed\nfor the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for\nthe [approved brand-name] drug.\u201d \u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(v).\n   Once a drug\u2014whether generic or brand-name\u2014is ap-\nproved, the manufacturer is prohibited from making any\nmajor changes to the \u201cqualitative or quantitative formula-\ntion of the drug product, including active ingredients, or in\n4       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

Generic manufacturers are also\nprohibited from making any unilateral changes to a drug\u2019s\nlabel. See \u00a7\u00a7314.94(a)(8)(iii), 314.150(b)(10) (approval for\na generic drug may be withdrawn if the generic drug\u2019s\nlabel \u201cis no longer consistent with that for [the brand-\nname] drug\u201d).\n                             II\n   In 1978, the FDA approved a nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory pain reliever called \u201csulindac\u201d under the\nbrand name Clinoril.

Accordingly, the state law is\npre-empted.\n                                A\n   We begin by identifying petitioner\u2019s duties under state\nlaw. As an initial matter, respondent is wrong in assert-\ning that the purpose of New Hampshire\u2019s design-\ndefect cause of action \u201cis compensatory, not regulatory.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 19. Rather, New Hampshire\u2019s design-\ndefect cause of action imposes affirmative duties on\nmanufacturers.\n   Respondent is correct that New Hampshire has adopted\nthe doctrine of strict liability in tort as set forth in Section\n402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See 2 Re-\nstatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7402A (1963 and 1964) (here-\ninafter Restatement 2d). See Buttrick v. Arthur Lessard &\nSons, Inc., 110 N. H. 36, 37\u201339, 260 A. 2d 111, 112\u2013113\n(1969). Under the Restatement\u2014and consequently, under\nNew Hampshire tort law\u2014\u201c[o]ne who sells any product in\na defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user\nor consumer or to his property is subject to liability for\nphysical harm thereby caused\u201d even though he \u201chas exer-\ncised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the\nproduct.\u201d Restatement 2d \u00a7402A, at 347\u2013348.\n   But respondent\u2019s argument conflates what we will call a\n\u201cstrict-liability\u201d regime (in which liability does not depend\non negligence, but still signals the breach of a duty) with\nwhat we will call an \u201cabsolute-liability\u201d regime (in which\nliability does not reflect the breach of any duties at all, but\nmerely serves to spread risk). New Hampshire has adopted\nthe former, not the latter. Indeed, the New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has consistently held that the manu-\nfacturer of a product has a \u201cduty to design his product\n8          MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

Accordingly, respondent is\nincorrect in arguing that New Hampshire\u2019s strict-liability\nsystem \u201cimposes no substantive duties on manufacturers.\u201d\nBrief for Respondent 19.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    1 Wecan thus save for another day the question whether a true\nabsolute-liability state-law system could give rise to impossibility\npre-emption. As we have noted, most common-law causes of action for\nnegligence and strict liability do not exist merely to spread risk, but\nrather impose affirmative duties. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552\nU. S. 312, 323\u2013324 (2008) (\u201cIn [Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.

We\nadhere to that view\u201d); id., at 324 (\u201cAbsent other indication, reference to\na State\u2019s \u2018requirements\u2019 includes its common-law duties. As the plurality\nopinion said in Cipollone [v. Liggett Group, 505 U.

S. ____ (2013)       9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                               B\n   That New Hampshire tort law imposes a duty on manu-\nfacturers is clear. Determining the content of that duty\nrequires somewhat more analysis. As discussed below in\ngreater detail, New Hampshire requires manufacturers to\nensure that the products they design, manufacture, and\nsell are not \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d The New Hamp-\nshire Supreme Court has recognized that this duty can be\nsatisfied either by changing a drug\u2019s design or by changing\nits labeling. Since Mutual did not have the option of\nchanging sulindac\u2019s design, New Hampshire law ultimately\nrequired it to change sulindac\u2019s labeling.\n   Respondent argues that, even if New Hampshire law\ndoes impose a duty on drug manufacturers, that duty does\nnot encompass either the \u201cduty to change sulindac\u2019s de-\nsign\u201d or the duty \u201cto change sulindac\u2019s labeling.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 30 (capitalization and emphasis deleted).\nThat argument cannot be correct. New Hampshire imposes\ndesign-defect liability only where \u201cthe design of the\nproduct created a defective condition unreasonably dan-\ngerous to the user.\u201d Vautour v. Body Masters Sports In-\ndustries, Inc., 147 N. H. 150, 153, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1181\n(2001); Chellman, supra, at 77, 637 A. 2d, at 150. To\ndetermine whether a product is \u201cunreasonably dangerous,\u201d\nthe New Hampshire Supreme Court employs a \u201crisk-\nutility approach\u201d under which \u201ca product is defective as\ndesigned if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the\nutility of the product.\u201d Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d,\nat 1182 (internal quotation marks omitted). That risk-\nutility approach requires a \u201cmultifaceted balancing pro-\ncess involving evaluation of many conflicting factors.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Thi-\nbault, supra, at 809, 395 A. 2d, at 847 (same).\n   While the set of factors to be considered is ultimately an\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nviolated a state-law obligation\u201d).\n10      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nopen one, the New Hampshire Supreme Court has repeat-\nedly identified three factors as germane to the risk-utility\ninquiry: \u201cthe usefulness and desirability of the product to\nthe public as a whole, whether the risk of danger could\nhave been reduced without significantly affecting either\nthe product\u2019s effectiveness or manufacturing cost, and the\npresence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an unreasona-\nble risk of harm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable\nuses.\u201d Vautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182; see also\nPrice, supra, at 389, 702 A. 2d, at 333 (same); Chellman,\nsupra, at 77\u201378, 637 A. 2d, at 150 (same).\n   In the drug context, either increasing the \u201cusefulness\u201d of\na product or reducing its \u201crisk of danger\u201d would require\nredesigning the drug: A drug\u2019s usefulness and its risk\nof danger are both direct results of its chemical design\nand, most saliently, its active ingredients. See 21 CFR\n\u00a7201.66(b)(2) (2012) (\u201cActive ingredient means any compo-\nnent that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity\nor other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitiga-\ntion, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the\nstructure of any function of the body of humans\u201d (italics\ndeleted)).\n   In the present case, however, redesign was not possible\nfor two reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug\nto have the same active ingredients, route of adminis-\ntration, dosage form, strength, and labeling as the\nbrand-name drug on which it is based. 21 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7355(j)(2)(A)(ii)\u2013(v) and (8)(B); 21 CFR \u00a7320.1(c). Conse-\nquently, the Court of Appeals was correct to recognize that\n\u201cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another composi-\ntion.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 37. Indeed, were Mutual to change the\ncomposition of its sulindac, the altered chemical would be a\nnew drug that would require its own NDA to be marketed\nin interstate commerce. See 21 CFR \u00a7310.3(h) (giving\nexamples of when the FDA considers a drug to be new,\nincluding cases involving \u201cnewness for drug use of any\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsubstance which composes such drug, in whole or in part\u201d).\nSecond, because of sulindac\u2019s simple composition, the drug\nis chemically incapable of being redesigned. See 678 F. 3d,\nat 37 (\u201cMutual cannot legally make sulindac in another\ncomposition (nor it is apparent how it could alter a one-\nmolecule drug anyway)\u201d).\n   Given the impossibility of redesigning sulindac, the only\nway for Mutual to ameliorate the drug\u2019s \u201crisk-utility\u201d\nprofile\u2014and thus to escape liability\u2014was to strengthen\n\u201cthe presence and efficacy of [sulindac\u2019s] warning\u201d in such\na way that the warning \u201cavoid[ed] an unreasonable risk of\nharm from hidden dangers or from foreseeable uses.\u201d\nVautour, supra, at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182. See also\nChellman, 138 N. H., at 78, 637 A. 2d, at 150 (\u201cThe duty to\nwarn is part of the general duty to design, manufacture\nand sell products that are reasonably safe for their fore-\nseeable uses. If the design of a product makes a warning\nnecessary to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from a\nforeseeable use, the lack of warning or an ineffective warn-\ning causes the product to be defective and unreasonably\ndangerous\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, New Hampshire\u2019s\ndesign-defect cause of action imposed a duty on Mutual to\nstrengthen sulindac\u2019s warnings.\n   For these reasons, it is unsurprising that allegations\nthat sulindac\u2019s label was inadequate featured prominently\nat trial. Respondent introduced into evidence both the\nlabel for Mutual\u2019s sulindac at the time of her injuries and\nthe label as revised in 2005 (after respondent had suffered\nher injuries). App. 553\u2013556. Her counsel\u2019s opening\nstatement informed the jury that \u201cthe evidence will show\nyou that Sulindac was unreasonably dangerous and had\nan inadequate warning, as well. . . . You will hear much\nmore evidence about why this label was inadequate in\nrelation to this case.\u201d Tr. 110\u2013112 (Aug. 17, 2010). And, the\nDistrict Court repeatedly instructed the jury that it should\nevaluate sulindac\u2019s labeling in determining whether\n12        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nMutual\u2019s sulindac was unreasonably dangerous. See\nApp. 514 (jury instruction that the jury should find \u201ca\ndefect in design\u201d only if it found that \u201cSulindac was unrea-\nsonably dangerous and that a warning was not present\nand effective to avoid that unreasonable danger\u201d); ibid.\n(jury instruction that no design defect exists if \u201ca warning\nwas present and effective to avoid that unreasonable\ndanger\u201d). Finally, the District Court clarified in its order\nand opinion denying Mutual\u2019s motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law that the adequacy of sulindac\u2019s labeling had\nbeen part of what the jury was instructed to consider. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467765\"><a href=\"/nhd/dDzF/bartlett-v-mutual-pharmaceutical-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rather, New Hampshire\u2014like a large majority of\nStates\u2014has adopted comment k to \u00a7402A of the Restatement (Second)\nof Torts, which recognizes that it is \u201cespecially common in the field of\ndrugs\u201d for products to be \u201cincapable of being made safe for their intended\nand ordinary use.\u201d Restatement 2d, at 353; Bellotte v.

S. 431, 447 (2005) (state-law pesticide labeling require-\nment not pre-empted under express pre-emption provision, provided it\nwas \u201cequivalent to, and fully consistent with, [federal] misbranding\nprovisions\u201d). The parties and the Government appear to agree that a\ndrug is misbranded under federal law only when liability is based on\nnew and scientifically significant information that was not before the\nFDA. Because the jury was not asked to find whether new evidence\nconcerning sulindac that had not been made available to the FDA\nrendered sulindac so dangerous as to be misbranded under the federal\nmisbranding statute, the misbranding provision is not applicable here.\nCf. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467765\"><a href=\"/nhd/dDzF/bartlett-v-mutual-pharmaceutical-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We reject this \u201cstop-selling\u201d ra-\ntionale as incompatible with our pre-emption jurispru-\ndence. Our pre-emption cases presume that an actor\nseeking to satisfy both his federal- and state-law obliga-\ntions is not required to cease acting altogether in order to\navoid liability. Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act de-\nfeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption\nwould be \u201call but meaningless.\u201d 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14).\n   The incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain\nwhen viewed through the lens of our previous cases. In\nevery instance in which the Court has found impossibility\npre-emption, the \u201cdirect conflict\u201d between federal- and\nstate-law duties could easily have been avoided if the\nregulated actor had simply ceased acting.\n   PLIVA is an obvious example: As discussed above, the\nPLIVA Court held that state failure-to-warn claims were\npre-empted by the FDCA because it was impossible for\ndrug manufacturers like PLIVA to comply with both the\nstate-law duty to label their products in a way that ren-\ndered them reasonably safe and the federal-law duty not\nto change their drugs\u2019 labels. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11). It\nwould, of course, have been possible for drug manufactur-\ners like PLIVA to pull their products from the market\naltogether. In so doing, they would have avoided liability\nunder both state and federal law: such manufacturers\nwould neither have labeled their products in a way that\nrendered them unsafe nor impermissibly changed any\nfederally approved label.\n   In concluding that \u201cit was impossible for the Manufac-\nturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change\nthe label and their federal law duty to keep the label the\nsame,\u201d id., at ___ (slip op., at 12), the Court was unde-\nterred by the prospect that PLIVA could have complied\nwith both state and federal requirements by simply leav-\ning the market. The Court of Appeals decision below had\n16        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nfound that Mensing\u2019s state-law failure-to-warn claims\nescaped pre-emption based on the very same stop-selling\nrationale the First Circuit relied on in this case. See\nMensing v. Wyeth, Inc., 588 F. 3d 603, 611 (CA8 2009)\n(\u201c[G]eneric defendants were not compelled to market\nmetoclopramide. If they realized their label was insuffi-\ncient . . . they could have simply stopped selling the prod-\nuct\u201d).     Moreover, Mensing advanced the stop-selling\nrationale in its petition for rehearing, which this Court\ndenied. PLIVA, supra; Pet. for Reh\u2019g in No. 09\u2013993 etc.,\np. 2. Nonetheless, this Court squarely determined that it\nhad been \u201cimpossible\u201d for PLIVA to comply with both its\nstate and federal duties. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).5\n   Adopting the First Circuit\u2019s stop-selling rationale would\nmean that not only PLIVA, but also the vast majority\u2014if\nnot all\u2014of the cases in which the Court has found impos-\nsibility pre-emption, were wrongly decided. Just as the\nprospect that a regulated actor could avoid liability under\nboth state and federal law by simply leaving the market\ndid not undermine the impossibility analysis in PLIVA, so\nit is irrelevant to our analysis here.\n                                  V\n     The dreadful injuries from which products liabilities\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 Respondent attempts to distinguish this case from PLIVA, arguing\n\nthat \u201c[w]here, as in PLIVA, state law imposes an affirmative duty on a\nmanufacturer to improve the product\u2019s label, suspending sales does not\ncomply with the state-law duty; it merely offers an indirect means of\navoiding liability for noncompliance with that duty.\u201d Brief for Re-\nspondent 39. But that difference is purely semantic: the state-law duty\nin PLIVA to amend metoclopramide\u2019s label could just as easily have\nbeen phrased as a duty not to sell the drug without adequate warnings.\nAt least where a State imposes liability based on a balancing of a\nproduct\u2019s harms and benefits in light of its labeling\u2014rather than\ndirectly prohibiting the product\u2019s sale\u2014the mere fact that a manufac-\nturer may avoid liability by leaving the market does not defeat a claim\nof impossibility.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncases arise often engender passionate responses. Today is\nno exception, as JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent (hereinaf-\nter the dissent) illustrates. But sympathy for respondent\ndoes not relieve us of the responsibility of following the\nlaw.\n   The dissent accuses us of incorrectly assuming \u201cthat\nfederal law gives pharmaceutical companies a right to sell\na federally approved drug free from common-law liability,\u201d\npost, at 1, but we make no such assumption. Rather, as\ndiscussed at length above, see supra, at 8\u201313, we hold that\nstate-law design-defect claims like New Hampshire\u2019s that\nplace a duty on manufacturers to render a drug safer by\neither altering its composition or altering its labeling are\nin conflict with federal laws that prohibit manufacturers\nfrom unilaterally altering drug composition or labeling.\nThe dissent is quite correct that federal law establishes no\nsafe-harbor for drug companies\u2014but it does prevent them\nfrom taking certain remedial measures. Where state law\nimposes a duty to take such remedial measures, it \u201cactu-\nal[ly] conflict[s] with federal law\u201d by making it \u201c \u2018impos-\nsible for a private party to comply with both state and\nfederal requirements.\u2019 \u201d Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514\nU. S. 280, 287 (1995) (quoting English, 496 U. S., at 78\u2013\n79). The dissent seems to acknowledge that point when it\nconcedes that, \u201cif federal law requires a particular product\nlabel to include a complete list of ingredients while state\nlaw specifically forbids that labeling practice, there is little\nquestion that state law \u2018must yield.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 6\u20137 (quoting\nFelder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138 (1988)). What the\ndissent does not see is that that is this case: Federal law\nrequires a very specific label for sulindac, and state law\nforbids the use of that label.\n   The dissent responds that New Hampshire law \u201cmerely\ncreate[s] an incentive\u201d to alter sulindac\u2019s label or composi-\ntion, post, at 7, but does not impose any actual \u201clegal\nobligation,\u201d post, at 13. The contours of that argument are\n18      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndifficult to discern. Perhaps the dissent is drawing a\ndistinction between common-law \u201cexposure to liability,\u201d\npost, at 12, and a statutory \u201clegal mandate,\u201d ibid. But the\ndistinction between common law and statutory law is\nirrelevant to the argument at hand: In violating a common-\nlaw duty, as surely as by violating a statutory duty, a\nparty contravenes the law. While it is true that, in a\ncertain sense, common-law duties give a manufacturer the\nchoice \u201cbetween exiting the market or continuing to sell\nwhile knowing it may have to pay compensation to con-\nsumers injured by its product,\u201d post, at 16, statutory\n\u201cmandate[s]\u201d do precisely the same thing: They require a\nmanufacturer to choose between leaving the market and\naccepting the consequences of its actions (in the form of a\nfine or other sanction). See generally Calabresi & Mela-\nmed, Property Rules, Liability Rules, and Inalienability:\nOne View of the Cathedral, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1089 (1972)\n(discussing liability rules). And, in any event, PLIVA\u2014\nwhich the dissent agrees involved a state-law \u201crequire-\nment that conflicted with federal law,\u201d post, at 13\u2014dealt\nwith common-law failure-to-warn claims, see PLIVA,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 4). Because PLIVA controls the\ninstant case, the dissent is reduced to fighting a rearguard\naction against its reasoning despite ostensibly swearing\nfealty to its holding.\n   To suggest that Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544\nU. S. 431 (2005), is to the contrary is simply misleading.\nThe dissent is correct that Bates held a Texas state-law\ndesign-defect claim not to be pre-empted. But, it did so\nbecause the design-defect claim in question was not a\n\u201crequirement \u2018for labeling or packaging \u2019 \u201d and thus fell\noutside the class of claims covered by the express pre-\nemption provision at issue in that case. Id., at 443\u2013444\n(emphasis in original). Indeed, contrary to the impression\none might draw from the dissent, post, at 12\u201313, the Bates\nCourt actually blessed the lower court\u2019s determination\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the State\u2019s design-defect claim imposed a pre-\nemptable \u201crequirement\u201d: \u201cThe Court of Appeals did, how-\never, correctly hold that the term \u2018requirements\u2019 in\n\u00a7136v(b) reaches beyond positive enactments, such as\nstatutes and regulations, to embrace common-law duties.\u201d\nBates, supra, at 443. The dissent offers no compelling\nreason why the \u201ccommon-law duty\u201d in this case should not\nsimilarly be viewed as a \u201crequirement.\u201d We agree, of\ncourse, that \u201cdetermining precisely what, if any, specific\nrequirement a state common-law claim imposes is im-\nportant.\u201d Post, at 12, n. 5. As Bates makes clear, \u201c[t]he\nproper inquiry calls for an examination of the elements of\nthe common-law duty at issue; it does not call for specula-\ntion as to whether a jury verdict will prompt the manu-\nfacturer to take any particular action.\u201d 544 U. S., at 445\n(citation omitted). Here, as we have tried to make clear,\nthe duty to ensure that one\u2019s products are not \u201cunreasona-\nbly dangerous\u201d imposed by New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect\ncause of action, Vautour, 147 N. H., at 153, 784 A. 2d, at\n1181, involves a duty to make one of several changes. In\ncases where it is impossible\u2014in fact or by law\u2014to alter a\nproduct\u2019s design (and thus to increase the product\u2019s \u201cuse-\nfulness\u201d or decrease its \u201crisk of danger\u201d), the duty to ren-\nder a product \u201creasonably safe\u201d boils down to a duty to\nensure \u201cthe presence and efficacy of a warning to avoid an\nunreasonable risk of harm from hidden dangers or from\nforeseeable uses.\u201d Id., at 154, 784 A. 2d, at 1182. The\nduty to redesign sulindac\u2019s label was thus a part of the\ncommon-law duty at issue\u2014not merely an action Mutual\nmight have been prompted to take by the adverse jury\nverdict here.\n    Finally, the dissent laments that we have ignored\n\u201cCongress\u2019 explicit efforts to preserve state common-law\nliability.\u201d Post, at 26. We have not. Suffice to say, the\nCourt would welcome Congress\u2019 \u201cexplicit\u201d resolution of the\ndifficult pre-emption questions that arise in the prescrip-\n20      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntion drug context. That issue has repeatedly vexed the\nCourt\u2014and produced widely divergent views\u2014in recent\nyears. See, e.g., Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U. S. 555 (2009);\nPLIVA, 564 U. S. ___. As the dissent concedes, however,\nthe FDCA\u2019s treatment of prescription drugs includes\nneither an express pre-emption clause (as in the vaccine\ncontext, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1)), nor an express non-\npre-emption clause (as in the over-the-counter drug con-\ntext, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7379r(e), 379s(d)). In the absence of that\nsort of \u201cexplicit\u201d expression of congressional intent, we are\nleft to divine Congress\u2019 will from the duties the statute\nimposes. That federal law forbids Mutual to take actions\nrequired of it by state tort law evinces an intent to\npre-empt.\n                         *     *     *\n   This case arises out of tragic circumstances. A combina-\ntion of factors combined to produce the rare and devastat-\ning injuries that respondent suffered: the FDA\u2019s decision\nto approve the sale of sulindac and the warnings that\naccompanied the drug at the time it was prescribed, the\ndecision by respondent\u2019s physician to prescribe sulindac\ndespite its known risks, and Congress\u2019 decision to regulate\nthe manufacture and sale of generic drugs in a way that\nreduces their cost to patients but leaves generic drug\nmanufacturers incapable of modifying either the drugs\u2019\ncompositions or their warnings. Respondent\u2019s situation is\ntragic and evokes deep sympathy, but a straightforward\napplication of pre-emption law requires that the judgment\nbelow be reversed.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Where the statute contains no\nclear pre-emption command, courts may infer that the\nadministrative agency has a degree of leeway to determine\nthe extent to which governing statutes, rules, regulations,\n2       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nor other administrative actions have pre-emptive effect.\nSee id., at 505\u2013506 (citing Smiley v. Citibank (South\nDakota), N. A., 517 U.

Cf. Skid-\nmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944). The FDA\nis responsible for administering the relevant federal stat-\nutes. And the question of pre-emption may call for consid-\nerable drug-related expertise. Indeed, one might infer\nthat, the more medically valuable the drug, the less likely\nCongress intended to permit a State to drive it from the\nmarketplace.\n    At the same time, the agency can develop an informed\nposition on the pre-emption question by providing inter-\nested parties with an opportunity to present their views.\nIt can translate its understandings into particular pre-\nemptive intentions accompanying its various rules and\nregulations. And \u201c[i]t can communicate those intentions\n . . . through statements in \u2018regulations, preambles, inter-\npretive statements, and responses to comments.\u2019\u201d Medtronic,\nsupra, at 506 (opinion of BREYER, J.). (quoting Hillsbor-\nough, supra, at 718).\n    Here, however, I cannot give special weight to the FDA\u2019s\nviews. For one thing, as far as the briefing reveals, the\nFDA, in developing its views, has held no hearings on the\nmatter or solicited the opinions, arguments, and views of\nthe public in other ways. For another thing, the FDA\nhas set forth its positions only in briefs filed in litigation,\nnot in regulations, interpretations, or similar agency work\nproduct. See Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.

S. 576,\n587 (2000).\n   Finally, the FDA has set forth conflicting views on this\ngeneral matter in different briefs filed at different times.\nCompare Wyeth, supra, at 577, 579, 580, n. 13 (noting that\nthe FDA had previously found no pre-emption, that the\nUnited States now argued for pre-emption, and that this\nnew position was not entitled to deference), with PLIVA,\nInc. v. Mensing, 564 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 6\u20137, n. 3, 8\u201311) (declining to defer to the\nUnited States\u2019 argument against pre-emption and, instead,\nfinding pre-emption), and with Brief for United States\nas Amicus Curiae 12\u201313 (now arguing, again, for pre-\nemption). See National Cable & Telecommunications\nAssn. v. Brand X Internet Services, 545 U. S. 967, 981\n(2005) (agency views that vary over time are accorded less\nweight); Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

S. 467, 502, n. 20 (2002) (same).\n   Without giving the agency\u2019s views special weight, I\nwould conclude that it is not impossible for petitioner to\ncomply with both state and federal regulatory schemes\nand that the federal regulatory scheme does not pre-empt\nstate common law (read as potentially requiring petitioner\nto pay damages or leave the market). As two former FDA\nCommissioners tell us, the FDA has long believed that\nstate tort litigation can \u201csupplemen[t] the agency\u2019s regula-\ntory and enforcement activities.\u201d Brief for Donald Ken-\nnedy et al. as Amici Curiae 5. See also Wyeth, supra, at 578\n(\u201cIn keeping with Congress\u2019 decision not to pre-empt\ncommon-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA tradition-\nally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug\nregulation\u201d).\n   Moreover, unlike the federal statute at issue in Med-\n4       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntronic, the statute before us contains no general pre-\nemption clause. See 518 U. S., at 481\u2013482. Cf. Wyeth,\nsupra, at 574 (presence of pre-emption clause could show\nthat \u201cCongress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle\nto its objectives\u201d). Furthermore, I have found no con-\nvincing reason to believe that removing this particular\ndrug from New Hampshire\u2019s market, or requiring damage\npayments for it there, would be so harmful that it would\nseriously undercut the purposes of the federal statutory\nscheme. Cf. post, at 21\u201322.\n  Finally, similarly situated defendants in other cases\nremain free to argue for \u201cobstacle pre-emption\u201d in respect\nto damage payments or market withdrawal, and demon-\nstrate the impossibility-of-compliance type of conflict that,\nin their particular cases, might create true incompatibility\nbetween state and federal regulatory schemes.\n  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Today, the Court unnecessarily\nand unwisely extends its holding in Mensing to pre-empt\nNew Hampshire\u2019s law governing design-defects with re-\nspect to generic drugs.\n   The Court takes this step by concluding that petitioner\nMutual Pharmaceutical was held liable for a failure-to-\nwarn claim in disguise, even though the District Court\nclearly rejected such a claim and instead allowed liability\non a distinct theory. See infra, at 13\u201315. Of greater con-\nsequence, the Court appears to justify its revision of re-\nspondent Karen Bartlett\u2019s state-law claim through an im-\nplicit and undefended assumption that federal law gives\npharmaceutical companies a right to sell a federally ap-\nproved drug free from common-law liability. Remarkably,\nthe Court derives this proposition from a federal law that,\nin order to protect consumers, prohibits manufacturers\nfrom distributing new drugs in commerce without federal\nregulatory approval, and specifically disavows any intent\nto displace state law absent a direct and positive conflict.\n   Karen Bartlett was grievously injured by a drug that a\n2         MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

The Court laments her \u201ctragic\u201d situa-\ntion, ante, at 20, but responsibility for the fact that Karen\nBartlett has been deprived of a remedy for her injuries\nrests with this Court. If our established pre-emption\nprinciples were properly applied in this case, and if New\nHampshire law were correctly construed, then federal law\nwould pose no barrier to Karen Bartlett\u2019s recovery. I re-\nspectfully dissent.\n                             I\n  I begin with \u201ctwo cornerstones of our pre-emption juris-\nprudence,\u201d Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.

First, \u201c \u2018the purpose of Congress is\nthe ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every pre-emption case.\u201d Ibid.\n(quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485\n(1996)). Second, we start from the \u201cassumption that the\nhistoric police powers of the States [are] not to be super-\nseded by [a] Federal Act unless that was the clear and\nmanifest purpose of Congress.\u201d Rice v.

S. C. \u00a7301 et seq., in Levine,\nwhere we held that a state failure-to-warn claim against\na brand-name drug manufacturer was not pre-empted by\nfederal law. 555 U. S., at 581. Tracing the history of\nfederal drug regulation from the 1906 Federal Food and\nDrugs Act, 34 Stat. 768, up to the FDCA and its major\namendments, the Court explained that federal drug law\nand state common-law liability have long been understood\nto operate in tandem to promote consumer safety. See\nLevine, 555 U. S., at 566\u2013568, 574. That basic principle,\nwhich the majority opinion elides, is essential to under-\nstanding this case.\n   The FDCA prohibits the \u201cintroduction into interstate\ncommerce [of ] any new drug\u201d without prior approval from\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n21 U. S. C. \u00a7355(a). Brand-name and generic drug manu-\nfacturers are required to make different showings to re-\nceive agency approval in this premarketing review process.\nSee ante, at 2\u20133. But in either case, the FDA\u2019s per-\nmission to market a drug has never been regarded as a\nfinal stamp of approval of the drug\u2019s safety. Under the\nFDCA, manufacturers, who have greater \u201caccess to infor-\nmation about their drugs\u201d than the FDA, Levine, 555\nU. S., at 578\u2013579, retain the ultimate responsibility for\nthe safety of the products they sell. In addition to their\nongoing obligations to monitor a drug\u2019s risks and to report\nadverse drug responses to the FDA, see 21 CFR \u00a7\u00a7314.80,\n314.81, 314.98 (2012), manufacturers may not sell a drug\nthat is \u201cdeemed to be misbranded\u201d because it is \u201cdanger-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nuseful. But the whole point of the presumption against pre-emption is\nthat congressional ambiguity should cut in favor of preserving state\nautonomy. See Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230\n(1947).\n4         MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

In the 1962 amendments to the FDCA, which\nestablished the FDA\u2019s premarketing review in its modern\nform, Congress adopted a saving clause providing that\nthe amendments should not be construed to invalidate\nany provision of state law absent \u201ca direct and positive\nconflict.\u201d \u00a7202, 76 Stat. 793.

Moreover, the FDA, which is tasked with monitor-\ning thousands of drugs on the market and considering new\ndrug applications, faces significant resource constraints\nthat limit its ability to protect the public from dangerous\ndrugs. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 578\u2013579, and n. 11; Brief\nfor Former FDA Commissioner Donald Kennedy et al. as\nAmici Curiae 6\u20137, 12\u201320. Tort suits can help fill the gaps\nin federal regulation by \u201cserv[ing] as a catalyst\u201d to identify\npreviously unknown drug dangers. Bates v. Dow Agrosci-\nences LLC, 544 U. S. 431, 451 (2005).\n    Perhaps most significant, state common law provides\ninjured consumers like Karen Bartlett with an opportu-\nnity to seek redress that is not available under federal law.\n\u201c[U]nlike most administrative and legislative regulations,\u201d\ncommon-law claims \u201cnecessarily perform an important re-\nmedial role in compensating accident victims.\u201d Sprietsma\nv. Mercury Marine, 537 U. S. 51, 64 (2002). While the\nCourt has not always been consistent on this issue, it has\nrepeatedly cautioned against reading federal statutes to\n\u201cremove all means of judicial recourse for those injured\u201d\nwhen Congress did not provide a federal remedy. Silk-\nwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984); see\n6       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ne.g., Bates, 544 U. S., at 449; Lohr, 518 U. S., at 487 (plu-\nrality opinion). And in fact, the legislative history of the\nFDCA suggests that Congress chose not to create a federal\ncause of action for damages precisely because it believed\nthat state tort law would allow injured consumers to\nobtain compensation. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 574\u2013575,\nand n. 7.\n                             II\n  In light of this background, Mutual should face an\nuphill climb to show that federal law pre-empts a New\nHampshire strict-liability claim against a generic drug\nmanufacturer for defective design. The majority neverthe-\nless accepts Mutual\u2019s argument that \u201ccompliance with\nboth federal and state [law was] a physical impossibility.\u201d\nFlorida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S.\n132, 142\u2013143 (1963); see ante, at 7. But if state and fed-\neral law are properly understood, it is clear that New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect claim did not impose a legal\nobligation that Mutual had to violate federal law to satisfy.\n                               A\n  Impossibility pre-emption \u201cis a demanding defense,\u201d Le-\nvine, 555 U. S., at 573, that requires the defendant to\nshow an \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d between federal and state\nlegal obligations, Silkwood, 464 U. S., at 256. The logic\nunderlying true impossibility pre-emption is that when\nstate and federal law impose irreconcilable affirmative\nrequirements, no detailed \u201cinquiry into congressional de-\nsign\u201d is necessary because the inference that Congress\nwould have intended federal law to displace the conflicting\nstate requirement \u201cis inescapable.\u201d Florida Lime, 373\nU. S., at 142\u2013143. So, for example, if federal law requires\na particular product label to include a complete list of\ningredients while state law specifically forbids that label-\ning practice, there is little question that state law \u201cmust\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nyield.\u201d Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138 (1988).\n   The key inquiry for impossibility pre-emption, then, is\nto identify whether state and federal law impose directly\nconflicting affirmative legal obligations such that state law\n\u201crequire[s] the doing of an act which is unlawful under\u201d\nfederal law. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra,\n479 U. S. 272, 292 (1987). Impossibility does not exist\nwhere the laws of one sovereign permit an activity that\nthe laws of the other sovereign restricts or even prohibits.\nSee Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nelson, 517\nU. S. 25, 31 (1996); Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn.,\nInc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467\nU. S. 461, 478, n. 21 (1984). So, to modify the previous\nexample, if federal law permitted (but did not require)\na labeling practice that state law prohibited, there would\nbe no irreconcilable conflict; a manufacturer could com-\nply with the more stringent regulation. And by the same\nlogic, impossibility does not exist where one sovereign\u2019s\nlaws merely create an incentive to take an action that the\nother sovereign has not authorized because it is possible to\ncomply with both laws.\n   Of course, there are other types of pre-emption. Courts\nmay find that state laws that incentivize what federal law\ndiscourages or forbid what federal law authorizes are pre-\nempted for reasons apart from impossibility: The state\nlaws may fall within the scope of an express pre-emption\nprovision, pose an obstacle to federal purposes and objec-\ntives, or intrude upon a field that Congress intended for\nfederal law to occupy exclusively. See Crosby v. National\nForeign Trade Council, 530 U. S. 363, 372\u2013373 (2000).\nBut absent a direct conflict between two mutually incom-\npatible legal requirements, there is no impossibility and\ncourts may not automatically assume that Congress in-\ntended for state law to give way. Instead, a more careful\ninquiry into congressional intent is called for, and that\ninquiry should be informed by the presumption against\n8       MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npre-emption.\n   In keeping with the strict standard for impossibility,\ncases that actually find pre-emption on that basis are rare.\nSee Abrams, Plenary Power Preemption, 99 Va. L. Rev.\n601, 608 (2013). Mensing is an outlier, as the Court found\nimpossibility because a generic drug manufacturer could\nnot strengthen its product label to come into line with a\nstate-law duty to warn without the exercise of judgment\nby the FDA. See 564 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 13\u201314).\nBut nothing in Mensing, nor any other precedent, dictates\nfinding impossibility pre-emption here.\n                               B\n  To assess whether it is physically impossible for Mutual\nto comply with both federal and state law, it is necessary\nto identify with precision the relevant legal obligations\nimposed under New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of\naction.\n  The majority insists that Mutual was required by New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect law to strengthen its warning\nlabel. In taking this position, the majority effectively re-\ncharacterizes Bartlett\u2019s design-defect claim as a de facto\nfailure-to-warn claim. The majority then relies on that re-\ncharacterization to hold that the jury found Mutual liable\nfor failing to fulfill its duty to label sulindac adequately,\nwhich Mensing forbids because a generic drug manufac-\nturer cannot independently alter its safety label. Ante, at\n13; see Mensing, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10). But the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that Mutual was held liable in this\ncase for violating a legal obligation to change its label is\ninconsistent with both New Hampshire state law and the\nrecord.\n  For its part, Mutual, in addition to making the argu-\nment now embraced by the majority, contends that New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect law effectively required it to\nchange the chemical composition of sulindac. Mutual\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nclaims that it was physically impossible to comply with\nthat duty consistent with federal law because drug manu-\nfacturers may not change the chemical composition of\ntheir products so as to create new drugs without submit-\nting a new drug application for FDA approval. See 21\nCFR \u00a7\u00a7310.3(h), 314.70(b)(2)(i). But just as New Hamp-\nshire\u2019s design-defect law did not impose a legal obligation\nfor Mutual to change its label, it also did not mandate that\nMutual change the drug\u2019s design.\n                                1\n                                a\n   Following blackletter products liability law under \u00a7402A\nof the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1963\u20131964) (herein-\nafter Second Restatement), New Hampshire recognizes\nstrict liability for three different types of product defects:\nmanufacturing defects, design defects, and warning de-\nfects. See Cheshire Medical Center v. W. R. Grace & Co.,\n49 F. 3d 26, 29 (CA1 1995). Because the District Court\ngranted Mutual summary judgment on Bartlett\u2019s failure-\nto-warn claim, only New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause\nof action remains at issue in this case.\n   A product has a defective design under New Hampshire\nlaw if it \u201cposes unreasonable dangers to consumers.\u201d\nThibault v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 118 N. H. 802, 807, 395\nA. 2d 843, 846 (1978). To determine whether a product is\nunreasonably dangerous, a jury is asked to make a risk-\nbenefit assessment by considering a nonexhaustive list\nof factors. See ante, at 9\u201310. In addition, New Hamp-\nshire has specifically rejected the doctrine, advocated by\nthe Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability \u00a72(b)\n(1997) (hereinafter Third Restatement), that a plaintiff\nmust present evidence of a reasonable alternative design\nto show that a product\u2019s design is defective. Instead,\n\u201cwhile proof of an alternative design is relevant in a de-\nsign defect case,\u201d it is \u201cneither a controlling factor nor an\n10        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

H. 150, 156, 784 A. 2d 1178, 1183\n(2001).\n   While some jurisdictions have declined to apply design-\ndefect liability to prescription drugs, New Hampshire, in\ncommon with many other jurisdictions, does subject pre-\nscriptions drugs to this distinct form of strict products\nliability. See 678 F. 3d 30, 35 (CA1 2012) (citing Brochu v.\nOrtho Pharmaceutical Corp., 642 F. 2d 652, 655 (CA1\n1981)); see also Third Restatement \u00a76, Comment f (collect-\ning cases from other jurisdictions).

Specifically, and contrary to the majority, see ante,\nat 11, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law did not require\nMutual to change its warning label. A drug\u2019s warning\nlabel is just one factor in a nonexclusive list for evaluating\nwhether a drug is unreasonably dangerous, see Vautour,\n147 N. H., at 156, 784 A. 2d, at 1183, and an adequate\nlabel is therefore neither a necessary nor a sufficient con-\ndition for avoiding design-defect liability. Likewise, New\nHampshire law imposed no duty on Mutual to change\nsulindac\u2019s chemical composition. The New Hampshire\nSupreme Court has held that proof of an alternative fea-\nsible design is not an element of a design-defect claim, see\nKelleher v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., 152 N. H. 813,\n831, 891 A. 2d 477, 492 (2006), and as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 11, sulindac was not realistically capable of\nbeing redesigned anyway because it is a single-molecule\ndrug.4\n   To be sure, New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect claim cre-\nates an incentive for drug manufacturers to make changes\nto its product, including to the drug\u2019s label, to try to avoid\nliability. And respondent overstates her case somewhat\nwhen she suggests that New Hampshire\u2019s strict-liability\nlaw is purely compensatory. See Brief for Respondent 19.\nAs is typically true of strict-liability regimes, New Hamp-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\np. 108 (2010). Like New Hampshire courts, these courts apply comment k\non a case-by-case basis. See 1 L. Frumer & M.

See Heath v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 123 N. H.\n512, 521\u2013522, 464 A. 2d 288, 293 (1983). But exposure to\nliability, and the \u201cincidental regulatory effects\u201d that flow\nfrom that exposure, Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486\nU. S. 174, 185\u2013186 (1988), is not equivalent to a legal\nmandate for a regulated party to take (or refrain from\ntaking) a specific action. This difference is a significant\none: A mandate leaves no choice for a party that wishes to\ncomply with the law, whereas an incentive may only influ-\nence a choice.\n   Our cases reflect this distinction. In Bates, for exam-\nple, we rejected an argument that design-defect claims\nbrought against a pesticide manufacturer were pre-empted\nbecause they would likely \u201cinduce\u201d the manufacturer to\nchange its product label and thus run afoul of an express\npre-emption provision forbidding state labeling \u201crequire-\nments\u201d that were different or in addition to federal re-\nquirements. 544 U. S., at 444\u2013446. A requirement, we\nexplained, \u201cis a rule of law that must be obeyed.\u201d Id., at\n445. \u201c[A]n event, such as a jury verdict, that merely moti-\nvates an optional decision,\u201d does not rise to that level.\nIbid.5\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 The majority suggests my account of Bates is \u201csimply misleading,\u201d\n\nante, at 18, but it simply misses the point. I recognize that, under the\nCourt\u2019s precedents, common-law duties may qualify as \u201crequirements,\u201d\nat least as that term has been used in express pre-emption provisions\nin federal law. See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., 552 U. S. 312, 323\u2013324\n(2008). But determining precisely what, if any, specific requirement a\nstate common-law claim imposes is important. In Bates, the lower\ncourt had accepted the same basic argument that the majority advances\nhere: that the plaintiffs\u2019 design-defect claim that a pesticide was \u201cun-\nreasonably dangerous\u201d was \u201cmerely a disguised claim for failure to\nwarn\u201d because success on the claim that the pesticide was dangerous to\ncrops in soil above a certain pH level would \u201cnecessarily induce\u201d a\nmanufacturer to change its product\u2019s label to avoid liability. Dow\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                   13\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  So too here. The fact that imposing strict liability for\ninjuries caused by a defective drug design might make a\ndrug manufacturer want to change its label or design (or\nboth) does not mean the manufacturer was actually re-\nquired by state law to take either action. And absent such\na legal obligation, the majority\u2019s impossibility argument\ndoes not get off the ground, because there was no state\nrequirement that it was physically impossible for Mutual\nto comply with while also following federal law. The case\nis therefore unlike Mensing, where it was \u201cundisputed\u201d\nthat applicable state tort law \u201crequire[d] a drug manufac-\nturer that is or should be aware of its product\u2019s danger\u201d to\nstrengthen its label\u2014a requirement that conflicted with\nfederal law preventing the manufacturer from doing so uni-\nlaterally, 564 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 4, 11\u201312).\nNew Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law did not require Mu-\ntual to do anything other than to compensate consumers\nwho were injured by an unreasonably dangerous drug.\n                               2\n  Moreover, the trial record in this case confirms that, con-\ntrary to the majority\u2019s insistence, Mutual was not held liable\nfor \u201cbreach[ing] [its] duty\u201d \u201cto label sulindac adequately.\u201d\nAnte, at 13.\n  When Bartlett filed suit against Mutual, she raised\ndistinct claims based on design defect and failure to warn.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAgrosciences LLC v. Bates, 332 F. 3d 323, 332\u2013333 (CA5 2003). This\nCourt explicitly rejected the notion that because design-defect liability\nmight lead a manufacturer to make a label change, it meant that the\nState\u2019s design-defect claim imposed a requirement for labeling or\npackaging. See 544 U. S., at 445\u2013446. The majority contends that this\ncase is different because the duty to redesign sulindac\u2019s label was an\nelement of New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect law. Ante, at 19. But it is\nnot. See supra, at 11. Rather, altering a product label is merely one\nstep a manufacturer might take to prevent its product from being\nconsidered unreasonably dangerous, and it is a step that New Hamp-\nshire law recognizes may be insufficient.

American Honda Motor\nCo., 141 N. H. 579, 586, 688 A. 2d 556, 562 (1997). After\nthe District Court granted summary judgment to Mutual\non the failure-to-warn claim, the court repeatedly ex-\nplained that an alleged failure to warn by Mutual could\nnot and did not provide the basis for Bartlett\u2019s recovery.\nSee 760 F. Supp. 2d, at 248\u2013249.6\n  The majority notes that the District Court admitted\nevidence regarding sulindac\u2019s label. Ante, at 11\u201312. But\nthe court did so because the label remained relevant for\nthe more limited purpose of assessing, in combination\nwith other factors, whether sulindac\u2019s design was defective\nbecause the product was unreasonably dangerous. See\n678 F. 3d, at 41. The District Court\u2019s instructions to the\njury adhered to this limited purpose. The court first told\nthe jury to determine whether sulindac was unreasonably\ndangerous by weighing its danger against its utility. App.\n513. The court further instructed the jury that if it deter-\nmined that sulindac was unreasonably dangerous without\nreference to the warning label, it could then consider the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 For example, in a ruling on proposed jury instructions, the District\n\nCourt made clear that \u201cBartlett cannot be allowed to circumvent this\ncourt\u2019s summary judgment ruling by using Sulindac\u2019s warning to\nestablish that the drug is unreasonably dangerous (i.e., arguing that\nSulindac is unreasonably dangerous because of its warning), where this\ncourt has already ruled that any inadequacy in the warning did not\ncause Bartlett\u2019s injuries.\u201d App. 343. Doing so, the court explained\n\u201cwould effectively turn this case back into a failure-to-warn case,\nrendering the summary judgment ruling meaningless.\u201d Ibid.\n  The District Court later told counsel that it had removed a failure-to-\nwarn instruction from the jury instructions because \u201c[t]his is not a\nfailure to warn case,\u201d and the court admonished counsel to \u201ctread care-\nfully\u201d in arguing about the warning label because the label\u2019s adequacy\nwas \u201cnot an issue before this jury.\u201d Id., at 496.\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

In other words, to hold Mutual liable,\nthe jury was required to find that sulindac \u201cwas unreason-\nably dangerous despite its warning, not because of it.\u201d Id.,\nat 341. The District Court also explained to the jury that\nbecause Bartlett\u2019s claim addressed only whether sulindac\u2019s\ndesign was defective, Mutual\u2019s conduct, \u201cwhich included\nany failure to change its warning, was \u2018not relevant to this\ncase.\u2019 \u201d 760 F. Supp. 2d, at 248.\n   The distinction drawn by the District Court between\npermissible and impermissible uses of evidence regarding\nsulindac\u2019s label is faithful to New Hampshire law. That\nlaw recognizes that the effectiveness of a warning label\nis just one relevant factor in determining whether a prod-\nuct\u2019s design is unreasonably dangerous, and that design-\ndefect and failure-to-warn claims are \u201cseparate.\u201d LeBlanc,\n141 N. H., at 586, 688 A. 2d, at 562.7 In short, as the\nDistrict Court made clear, Mutual was not held liable for\n\u201cfailing to change\u201d its warning. 760 F. Supp., at 248\u2013249.\n                              C\n  Given the distinction that New Hampshire draws be-\ntween failure-to-warn claims and design-defect claims, as\nwell as the clear and repeated statements by the trial\njudge that Mutual\u2019s liability was not predicated on breach-\ning a duty to label sulindac adequately, on what basis does\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 To the extent the majority believes that the District Court in prac-\n\ntice allowed the adequacy of the warning label to play a greater role\nat trial than it should have, see ante, at 11\u201312, that is irrelevant to the\nquestion before the Court. Statements by counsel, even if improper, do\nnot change the state law cause of action that we evaluate for pre-\nemption purposes. And the Court of Appeals specifically concluded that\nthe District Court\u2019s jury instructions were appropriate and that \u201c[i]f\nMutual wanted a further caution in the instructions\u201d concerning its\nwarning label, then Mutual \u201cshould have sought it.\u201d 678 F. 3d 30, 41\u2013\n42 (CA1 2012).\n16        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nthe majority reach a contrary conclusion? Though the\nmajority insists otherwise, ante, at 17, it appears to rely\nprincipally on an implicit assumption about rights con-\nferred by federal premarket approval under the FDCA.\nAfter correctly observing that changing sulindac\u2019s chemi-\ncal composition would create a new drug that would have\nto go through its own approval process, the majority rea-\nsons that Mutual must have been under a state-law duty\nto change its label because it had no other option to avoid\nliability while continuing to sell its product. Ante, at 10\u2013\n11. But that conclusion is based on a false premise.\n   A manufacturer of a drug that is unreasonably danger-\nous under New Hampshire law has multiple options: It\ncan change the drug\u2019s design or label in an effort to alter\nits risk-benefit profile, remove the drug from the market,\nor pay compensation as a cost of doing business. If federal\nlaw or the drug\u2019s chemical properties take the redesign\noption off the table, then that does not mean the manufac-\nturer suddenly has a legal obligation under state law to\nimprove the drug\u2019s label. Indeed, such a view of state law\nmakes very little sense here because even if Mutual had\nstrengthened its label to fully account for sulindac\u2019s risks,\nthe company might still have faced liability for having\na defective design. See Thibault, 118 N. H., at 808, 395\nA. 2d, at 847 (explaining that strict liability \u201cmay attach\neven though . . . there was an adequate warning\u201d). When\na manufacturer cannot change the label or when doing so\nwould not make the drug safe, the manufacturer may still\nchoose between exiting the market or continuing to sell\nwhile knowing it may have to pay compensation to con-\nsumers injured by its product.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 The majority\u2019s suggestion that a manufacturer\u2019s option of continuing\n\nto sell while paying compensation is akin to violating a statutory\nmandate and then suffering the consequence (such as paying a fine) is\nflawed. See ante, at 18. In that scenario, the manufacturer would have\nviolated the law, and the fact that the law is enforced through mone-\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

But it is a choice that a sovereign\nState may impose to protect its citizens from dangerous\ndrugs or at least ensure that seriously injured consumers\nreceive compensation. That is, a State may impose such a\nchoice unless the FDCA gives manufacturers an absolute\nright to sell their products free from common-law liability,\nor state law otherwise \u201cstands as an obstacle to the ac-\ncomplishment\u201d of federal objectives. Crosby, 530 U. S., at\n373 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the\nmajority does not rely on obstacle pre-emption, it must\nbelieve that a manufacturer that received FDA premarket\napproval has a right not only to keep its drug on the mar-\nket unless and until the FDA revokes approval, but also to\nbe free from state-law liability that makes doing so more\nexpensive. That proposition is fundamentally inconsistent\nwith the FDCA\u2019s text, structure, saving clause, and his-\ntory. See supra, at 3\u20136; Levine, 555 U. S., at 583 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in judgment).\n   It is simply incorrect to say that federal law presupposes\nthat drug manufacturers have a right to continue to sell a\ndrug free from liability once it has been approved. Noth-\ning in the language of the FDCA, which is framed as a\nprohibition on distribution without FDA approval, see 21\nU. S. C. \u00a7355(a), suggests such a right. Federal law itself\nbars the sale of previously approved drugs if new infor-\nmation comes to light demonstrating that the drug is\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ntary sanctions (rather than through an injunction or imprisonment)\nwould not change that. Here, no matter how many times the majority\ninsists otherwise, ibid., a manufacturer who sells a drug whose design\nis found unreasonably dangerous based on a balance of factors has not\nviolated a state law requiring it to change its label. In both cases, the\nmanufacturer may owe money. But only in the former will it have\nfailed to follow the law. Cf. National Federation of Independent Busi-\nness v. Sebelius, 567 U. S. __, __ (2012) (slip op., at 32) (recognizing that\na condition that triggers a tax is not necessarily a \u201clegal command\u201d to\ntake a certain action).\n18        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v.

See U. S. Brief 5.\n   New Hampshire\u2019s design-defect cause of action thus\ndoes no more than provide an impetus for an action that is\npermitted and sometimes encouraged or even required by\nfederal law.\n                               D\n  The majority derides any suggestion that Mutual\u2019s\nability to \u201cstop selling\u201d sulindac is relevant to the validity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 The majority properly leaves open the question whether state de-\n\nsign-defect claims that parallel the federal misbranding statute are pre-\nempted. See ante, at 14, n. 4. The majority fails to appreciate, however,\nthat this statute undermines its impossibility argument (as compared\nto an argument based on obstacle pre-emption) because it shows that\nthere is no federal right or obligation to continue to sell a drug like\nsulindac that was previously approved. In fact, the statute demon-\nstrates that sometimes a drug manufacturer like Mutual may have a\nfederal duty not to sell its drug.\n  10 See Government Accountability Office, Drug Safety: Improvement\n\nNeeded in FDA\u2019s Postmarket Decision-making and Oversight Process\n10 (GAO\u201306\u2013402, 2006) (noting that 10 drugs were voluntarily with-\ndrawn for safety reasons between 2000 and 2006); Wysowski & Swartz,\nAdverse Drug Event Surveillance and Drug Withdrawals in the United\nStates, 1969\u20132002, 165 Archives Internal Med. 1363 (2005) (noting that\nmore than 75 drugs and drug products were withdrawn from the\nmarket for safety reasons between 1969 and 2002).\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Ante, at 2, 14\u201316.\nBut the majority\u2019s argument is built on the mistaken\npremise that Mutual is legally obligated by New Hamp-\nshire\u2019s design-defect law to modify its label in a way that\nfederal law forbids. It is not. See supra, at 11\u201313. For\nthat reason, rejecting impossibility pre-emption here would\nnot render the doctrine \u201ca dead letter\u201d or \u201c \u2018all but mean-\ningless.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 2, 15 (quoting Mensing, 564 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 14)). On the other hand, it is the major-\nity that \u201cwork[s] a revolution in this Court\u2019s [impossibility]\npre-emption case law,\u201d ante, at 2, by inferring a state-law\nrequirement from the steps a manufacturer might wish to\ntake to avoid or mitigate its exposure to liability.\n   Not all products can be made safe for sale with an im-\nproved warning or a tweak in design. New Hampshire,\nthrough its design-defect law, has made a judgment that\nsome drugs that were initially approved for distribution\nturn out to be inherently and unreasonably dangerous\nand should therefore not be sold unless the manufacturer\nis willing to compensate injured consumers. Congressional\nintent to pre-empt such a cause of action cannot be\ngleaned from the existence of federal specifications that\napply to the product if it is sold. Instead, whether New\nHampshire\u2019s design-defect cause-of-action is pre-empted\ndepends on assessing whether it poses an obstacle to a\nfederal policy to approve sulindac for use. Yet the major-\nity skips that analysis and instead finds impossibility\nwhere it does not exist by relying on a question-begging\nassumption that Congress intended for Mutual to have a\nway to continue selling sulindac without incurring com-\nmon-law liability. See ante, at 9\u201311.\n   The distinction between impossibility and obstacle pre-\nemption is an important one. While obstacle pre-emption\ncan be abused when courts apply an overly broad concep-\ntion of the relevant federal purpose to find pre-emption,\nsee Levine, 555 U. S., at 601\u2013602 (THOMAS, J., concurring\n20        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nin judgment), it is a useful framework for a case like this\none because it would at least lead the Court to ask the\nright questions.\n   For example, properly evaluating the asserted conflict\nhere through the lens of obstacle pre-emption would allow\nthe Court to consider evidence about whether Congress\nintended the FDA to make an optimal safety determina-\ntion and set a maximum safety standard (in which case\nstate tort law would undermine the purpose) rather than\na minimal safety threshold (in which case state tort\nlaw could supplement it). See, e.g., Williamson v. Mazda\nMotor of America, Inc., 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op.,\nat 11). By contrast, the majority\u2019s overbroad impossibility\nframework takes no account of how federal drug safety\nreview actually works. Though the majority gestures to\nthe rigorous nature of the FDA\u2019s review of new drug ap-\nplications, ante, at 2\u20133, nothing in the majority\u2019s reason-\ning turns on how the FDA\u2019s premarketing review operates\nor on the agency\u2019s capacity to engage in postmarketing\nreview.\n   In taking the approach it does, the majority replaces\ncareful assessment of regulatory structure with an ipse\ndixit that pharmaceutical companies must have a way to\n\u201cescape liability,\u201d ante, at 11, while continuing to sell a\ndrug that received FDA approval. As a result, the major-\nity effectively makes a highly contested policy judgment\nabout the relationship between FDA review and state tort\nlaw\u2014treating the FDA as the sole guardian of drug\nsafety\u2014without defending its judgment and without con-\nsidering whether that is the policy judgment that Congress\nmade.11\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Defending a policy judgment that treats the FDA as the exclusive\n\nguarantor of drug safety would be no easy task in light of evidence that\nresource constraints and gaps in legal authority, among other factors,\nlimit the agency\u2019s ability to safeguard public health.

The FDA, through an amicus brief filed by the\nUnited States, generally supports this argument. The\nFDA states that the question whether a design-defect\nclaim12 is pre-empted is \u201cdifficult and close,\u201d and it recog-\nnizes that \u201c[s]everal factors do weigh in favor of finding no\npreemption,\u201d including the absence of textual support in\nthe FDCA for the idea that an approved drug must be\nmade available in any particular State. See U. S. Brief\n12, 21\u201322. But the FDA ultimately contends that design-\ndefect claims are pre-empted unless they parallel the\nFDCA\u2019s misbranding prohibition because the agency be-\nlieves that permitting juries to balance the health risks\nand benefits of an FDA-approved drug would undermine\nthe FDA\u2019s drug-safety determinations and could reduce\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nFailure-to-Warn Claims, 96 Geo.

BARTLETT\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\naccess to drugs that the FDA has determined are safe and\neffective.\n   Our cases have \u201cgiven \u2018some weight\u2019 to an agency\u2019s\nviews about the impact of tort law on federal objectives\nwhen \u2018the subject matter is technica[l] and the relevant\nhistory and background are complex and extensive.\u2019 \u201d\nLevine, 555 U. S., at 576 (quoting Geier v. American Hon-\nda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861, 883 (2000)). But courts do\nnot \u201cdefe[r] to an agency\u2019s conclusion that state law is pre-\nempted,\u201d 555 U. S., at 576, and the tension that the FDA\nidentifies in an effort to justify complete pre-emption of\ndesign-defect claims for prescription drugs does not satisfy\nthe \u201c high threshold [that] must be met if a state law is to\nbe pre-empted for conflicting with the purposes of a federal\nAct,\u201d Chamber of Commerce of United States of America,\nv. Whiting, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 22) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted); see Silkwood, 464 U. S., at\n256. Given the FDCA\u2019s core purpose of protecting con-\nsumers, our recognition in Levine that state tort law gen-\nerally complements the statute\u2019s safety goals, the practical\nlimits on the FDA\u2019s ability to monitor and promptly ad-\ndress concerns about drug safety once a drug is in the\nmarket, see supra, at 5, 20\u201321, n. 11, and the absence of\nany federal remedy for injured consumers, I would reject\nthis broad obstacle pre-emption argument as well.13\n                           IV\n  The most troubling aspect of the majority\u2019s decision to\nonce again expand the scope of this Court\u2019s traditionally\nnarrow impossibility pre-emption doctrine is what it im-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 I note that we are not confronted with a case in which the FDA\n\npromulgated \u201clawful specific regulations describing\u201d whether and under\nwhat circumstances state design-defect liability interferes with \u201cthe\nsafe drug-related medical care\u201d sought through the FDCA. Levine, 555\nU. S., at 582 (BREYER, J., concurring). See also ante, at 2\u20133 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting).\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 23\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nplies about the relationship between federal premarket\nreview and state common-law remedies more generally.\nCentral to the majority\u2019s holding is an assumption that\nmanufacturers must have a way to avoid state-law lia-\nbility while keeping particular products in commerce.\nSee ante, at 9\u201311, 14\u201315. This assumption, it seems, will\nalways create an automatic conflict between a federal\npremarket review requirement and state-law design-defect\nliability because premarket review, by definition, prevents\nmanufacturers from unilaterally changing their products\u2019\ndesigns.14 That is true, for example, of the designs (i.e.,\nthe chemical composition) of brand-name drugs under\nthe FDCA no less than it is for generic drugs. See ante, at\n3\u20134.\n   If the creation of such an automatic conflict is the ulti-\nmate end-point of the majority\u2019s continued expansion of\nimpossibility pre-emption, then the result is frankly aston-\nishing. Congress adopted the FDCA\u2019s premarketing ap-\nproval requirement in 1938 and then strengthened it in\n1962 in response to serious public-health episodes involv-\ning unsafe drugs. See Future of Drug Safety 152. Yet by\nthe majority\u2019s lights, the very act of creating that re-\nquirement in order to \u201csafeguard the consumer,\u201d United\nStates v. Sullivan, 332 U. S. 689, 696 (1948), also created\nby operation of law a shield for drug manufacturers to\navoid paying common-law damages under state laws that\nare also designed to protect consumers. That is so not-\nwithstanding Congress\u2019 effort to disclaim any intent to\npre-empt all state law. See supra, at 4. The majority\u2019s\nreasoning thus \u201chas the \u2018perverse effect\u2019 of granting broad\nimmunity \u2018to an entire industry that, in the judgment of\nCongress, needed more stringent regulation.\u2019 \u201d Riegel, 552\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Or at least it creates an automatic conflict with the caveat that\n\ndesign-defect claims that parallel a federal duty for manufacturers to\nwithdraw a product might not be pre-empted. See ante, at 13\u201314, n. 3.\n24        MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nU. S., at 338 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (quoting Lohr, 518\nU. S., at 487 (plurality opinion)).\n   This expanded notion of impossibility pre-emption\nthreatens to disturb a considerable amount of state law.\nThe FDCA\u2019s premarket approval process for prescription\ndrugs has provided a model for the regulation of many\nother products.15 In some statutes, Congress has paired\npremarket regulatory review with express pre-emption\nprovisions that limit the application of state common-law\nremedies, including, in some instances, claims for defec-\ntive product design. See, e.g., Riegel, 552 U. S., at 323\u2013\n325; see supra, at 4, and n. 2. In other instances, such as\nwith prescription drugs, it has not. Under the majority\u2019s\napproach, it appears that design-defect claims are categor-\nically displaced either way, and Congress\u2019 efforts to set the\nboundaries of pre-emption more precisely were largely\nacademic. This could have serious consequences for prod-\nuct safety. State design-defect laws play an important role\nnot only in discovering risks, but also in providing in-\ncentives for manufacturers to remove dangerous products\nfrom the market promptly. See Levine, 555 U. S., at 578\u2013\n579; Bates, 544 U. S., at 451; see also Conk, Is There a\nDesign Defect in the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Prod-\nucts Liability? 109 Yale L. J. 1087, 1130 (2000) (\u201cThe tort\nsystem can encourage FDA regulatory vigor and compe-\ntence\u201d). If manufacturers of products that require preap-\nproval are given de facto immunity from design-defect\nliability, then the public will have to rely exclusively on\nimperfect federal agencies with limited resources and\nsometimes limited legal authority to recall approved prod-\nucts. And consumers injured by those products will have\nno recourse.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 See, e.g., 7 U. S. C. \u00a7136a (pesticides); 21 U. S. C. \u00a7348 (food addi-\n\ntives); \u00a7360b (animal drugs); \u00a7\u00a7360c(a)(1)(C), 360e (certain medical\ndevices); \u00a7379e (color additives).\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            25\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The manner in which Congress has addressed pre-\nemption with respect to vaccines is particularly instructive.\n\u201c[V]accines have been subject to the same federal pre-\nmarket approval process as prescription drugs,\u201d and prior\nto Congress\u2019 intervention, \u201ccompensation for vaccine-\nrelated injuries ha[d] been left largely to the States.\u201d\nBruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip\nop., at 1). In 1986, in response to a rise in tort suits that\nproduced instability in the vaccine market, Congress\nenacted the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (Vac-\ncine Act), 42 U. S. C. \u00a7300aa\u201322(b)(1). The Act established\na no-fault compensation program funded through an\nexcise tax on vaccines to compensate individuals injured\nor killed by vaccine side effects. \u201cThe quid pro quo for\nthis\u201d system, the Court stated in Bruesewitz, \u201cwas the\nprovision of significant tort-liability protections for vaccine\nmanufacturers.\u201d 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n  While Members of this Court disagreed on the scope of\nthe tort protections the Vaccine Act was intended to offer,\nthe Act\u2019s history demonstrates that Congress is perfectly\ncapable of responding when it believes state tort law may\ncompromise significant federal objectives under a scheme\nof premarket regulatory review for products it wants to\nmake available. And it illustrates that \u201can important\nreason to require that preemption decisions be made by\nCongress,\u201d rather than by courts on the basis of an ex-\npanded implied pre-emption doctrine, is Congress\u2019 ability\nto tie its pre-emption decisions \u201cto some alternative means\nfor securing compensation.\u201d Metzger, Federalism and Fed-\neral Agency Reform, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 33 (2011).\nBy instead reaching out to find pre-emption in a context\nwhere Congress never intended it, the majority leaves\nconsumers like Karen Bartlett to bear enormous losses on\ntheir own.\n26      MUTUAL PHARMACEUTICAL CO. v. BARTLETT\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n                          *  *     *\n   The Court recognizes that \u201c[t]his case arises out of\ntragic circumstances.\u201d Ante, at 20. And I do not doubt\nthat Members of the majority personally feel sympathy for\nKaren Bartlett. But the Court\u2019s solemn affirmation that\nit merely discharges its duty to \u201cfollo[w] the law,\u201d ante, at\n17, and gives effect to Congress\u2019 policy judgment, rather\nthan its own, is hard to accept. By once again expanding\nthe scope of impossibility pre-emption, the Court turns\nCongress\u2019 intent on its head and arrives at a holding that\nis irreconcilable with our precedents. As a result, the\nCourt has left a seriously injured consumer without any\nremedy despite Congress\u2019 explicit efforts to preserve state\ncommon-law liability.\n   I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
