UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 11\u2013345.      Argued October 10, 2012\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nThe University of Texas at Austin considers race as one of various fac-\n  tors in its undergraduate admissions process. The University, which\n  is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its\n  current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\n  U. S. 306, upholding the use of race as one of many \u201cplus factors\u201d in\n  an admissions program that considered the overall individual contri-\n  bution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n  244, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automati-\n  cally awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.\n     Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the\n  University\u2019s 2008 entering class. She sued the University and school\n  officials, alleging that the University\u2019s consideration of race in admis-\n  sions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment to the University. Affirming, the Fifth\n  Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial defer-\n  ence to the University, both in the definition of the compelling inter-\n  est in diversity\u2019s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan\n  was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal. Applying that\n  standard, the court upheld the University\u2019s admissions plan.\nHeld: Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the de-\n manding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents\n of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, its decision affirming the Dis-\n trict Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the University was incor-\n rect. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question\n considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n In Bakke\u2019s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state\n university \u201cdecisions based on race or ethnic origin . . . are reviewable\n2           FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d 438 U. S., at 287, using a strict\n    scrutiny standard, id., at 299. He identified as a compelling interest\n    that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educa-\n    tional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that\n    this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array \u201cof qualifica-\n    tions and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a sin-\n    gle though important element.\u201d Id., at 315\n       In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing\n    that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial\n    review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e.,\n    a university must clearly demonstrate that its \u201c \u2018purpose or interest is\n    both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of\n    the classification is \u201cnecessary . . . to the accomplishment\u201d of its pur-\n    pose,\u2019 \u201d Bakke, supra, at 305. Additional guidance may be found in\n    the Court\u2019s broader equal protection jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rice v.\n    Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 517; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n    469, 505. Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the gov-\n    ernment bears the burden to prove \u201c \u2018that the reasons for any [racial]\n    classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.\u2019 \u201d\n    Ibid. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admis-\n    sions program using racial categories or classifications. A court may\n    give some deference to a university\u2019s \u201cjudgment that such diversity is\n    essential to its educational mission,\u201d 539 U. S., at 328, provided that\n    diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a rea-\n    soned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this\n    point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for\n    deference to the University\u2019s experience and expertise about its edu-\n    cational mission. However, once the University has established that\n    its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University\n    must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are nar-\n    rowly tailored to its goal. On this point, the University receives no\n    deference. Id., at 333. It is at all times the University\u2019s obligation to\n    demonstrate, and the Judiciary\u2019s obligation to determine, that admis-\n    sions processes \u201censure that each applicant is evaluated as an indi-\n    vidual and not in a way that makes an applicant\u2019s race or ethnicity\n    the defining feature of his or her application.\u201d Id., at 337. Narrow\n    tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is \u201cneces-\n    sary\u201d for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n    of diversity. Bakke, supra, at 305. The reviewing court must ulti-\n    mately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would\n    produce the educational benefits of diversity.\n       Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit\n    held petitioner could challenge only whether the University\u2019s decision\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to use race as an admissions factor \u201cwas made in good faith.\u201d It pre-\n  sumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the\n  burden of rebutting that presumption. It thus undertook the narrow-\n  tailoring requirement with a \u201cdegree of deference\u201d to the school.\n  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grut-\n  ter\u2019s command that \u201call racial classifications imposed by government\n  \u2018must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d 539\n  U. S., at 326. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a\n  school\u2019s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissi-\n  ble way without closely examining how the process works in practice,\n  yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The\n  Court vacates the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment. But fairness to the liti-\n  gants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded\n  so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a\n  correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the\n  University\u2019s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess\n  whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that\n  its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational\n  benefits of diversity.

UNIVERSITY\n          OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                 [June 24, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   The University of Texas at Austin considers race as one\nof various factors in its undergraduate admissions process.\nRace is not itself assigned a numerical value for each ap-\nplicant, but the University has committed itself to\nincreasing racial minority enrollment on campus. It refers\nto this goal as a \u201ccritical mass.\u201d Petitioner, who is Cauca-\nsian, sued the University after her application was re-\njected. She contends that the University\u2019s use of race in\nthe admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   The parties asked the Court to review whether the\njudgment below was consistent with \u201cthis Court\u2019s deci-\nsions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 306 (2003).\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. The Court concludes\nthat the Court of Appeals did not hold the University\nto the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated\nin Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S.\n265, 305 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Because the Court\nof Appeals did not apply the correct standard of strict\n2       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court\u2019s grant\nof summary judgment to the University was incorrect.\nThat decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Located in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus\nof the Texas state university system, the University is one\nof the leading institutions of higher education in the Na-\ntion. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when\npetitioner sought admission to the University\u2019s entering\nclass, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group\n12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.\nPetitioner was denied admission.\n   In recent years the University has used three different\nprograms to evaluate candidates for admission. The first\nis the program it used for some years before 1997, when\nthe University considered two factors: a numerical score\nreflecting an applicant\u2019s test scores and academic perform-\nance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the\napplicant\u2019s race. In 1996, this system was held unconsti-\ntutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. It ruled the University\u2019s consideration of\nrace violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did\nnot further any compelling government interest. Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932, 955 (1996).\n   The second program was adopted to comply with the\nHopwood decision. The University stopped considering\nrace in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic\nmetric of a candidate\u2019s potential contribution to the Uni-\nversity, to be used in conjunction with the Academic In-\ndex. This \u201cPersonal Achievement Index\u201d (PAI) measures a\nstudent\u2019s leadership and work experience, awards, extra-\ncurricular activities, community service, and other special\ncircumstances that give insight into a student\u2019s back-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nground. These included growing up in a single-parent\nhome, speaking a language other than English at home,\nsignificant family responsibilities assumed by the appli-\ncant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the stu-\ndent\u2019s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority\nenrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded\nits outreach programs.\n   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop\u00ad\nwood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top\nTen Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a751.803\n(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top\nTen Percent Law grants automatic admission to any pub-\nlic state college, including the University, to all students\nin the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas\nthat comply with certain standards.\n   The University\u2019s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.\nBefore the admissions program at issue in this case, in the\nlast year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did\nnot consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-\nAmerican and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with\nthe 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when\nrace was explicitly considered, and the University\u2019s enter-\ning freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%\nHispanic.\n   Following this Court\u2019s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,\nsupra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), the\nUniversity adopted a third admissions program, the 2004\nprogram in which the University reverted to explicit con-\nsideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In\nGrutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many\n\u201cplus factors\u201d in an admissions program that considered\nthe overall individual contribution of each candidate. In\nGratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michi-\ngan\u2019s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-\n4       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nically awarded points to applicants from certain racial\nminorities.\n   The University\u2019s plan to resume race-conscious admis-\nsions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-\nternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and\nEthnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The\nProposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset\nof undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24\nstudents. It showed that few of these classes had signifi-\ncant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addi-\ntion the Proposal relied on what it called \u201canecdotal\u201d\nreports from students regarding their \u201cinteraction in the\nclassroom.\u201d The Proposal concluded that the University\nlacked a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students and that to\nremedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit\nconsideration to race in the undergraduate admissions\nprogram.\n   To implement the Proposal the University included a\nstudent\u2019s race as a component of the PAI score, begin-\nning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University\nasks students to classify themselves from among five\npredefined racial categories on the application. Race is not\nassigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed\nthat race is a meaningful factor.\n   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted\non a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the\nPersonal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid\nstudents are assigned to so-called cells based on their\nindividual scores. All students in the cells falling above a\ncertain line are admitted. All students below the line are\nnot. Each college\u2014such as Liberal Arts or Engineering\u2014\nadmits students separately. So a student is considered\ninitially for her first-choice college, then for her second\nchoice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared\nmajor.\n   Petitioner applied for admission to the University\u2019s 2008\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentering class and was rejected. She sued the University\nand various University officials in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged\nthat the University\u2019s consideration of race in admissions\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties cross-\nmoved for summary judgment. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the University. The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held\nthat Grutter required courts to give substantial deference\nto the University, both in the definition of the compelling\ninterest in diversity\u2019s benefits and in deciding whether its\nspecific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated\ngoal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the Uni-\nversity\u2019s admissions plan. 631 F. 3d 213, 217\u2013218 (2011).\n   Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals\ndenied petitioner\u2019s request for rehearing en banc. See 644\nF. 3d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per curiam). Petitioner sought\na writ of certiorari. The writ was granted. 565 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                              B\n  Among the Court\u2019s cases involving racial classifications\nin education, there are three decisions that directly ad-\ndress the question of considering racial minority status as\na positive or favorable factor in a university\u2019s admissions\nprocess, with the goal of achieving the educational benefits\nof a more diverse student body: Bakke, 438 U. S. 265;\nGratz, supra; and Grutter, 539 U. S. 306. We take those\ncases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n  We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice\nPowell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered\na system used by the medical school of the University of\nCalifornia at Davis. From an entering class of 100 stu-\ndents the school had set aside 16 seats for minority appli-\ncants. In holding this program impermissible under the\nEqual Protection Clause Justice Powell\u2019s opinion stated\n6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain basic premises. First, \u201cdecisions based on race\nor ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state\nuniversities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.\u201d Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle\nof equal protection admits no \u201cartificial line of a \u2018two-\nclass theory\u2019 \u201d that \u201cpermits the recognition of special\nwards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that\naccorded others.\u201d Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant\nthat a system of racial preferences in admissions may\nseem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict\nscrutiny, for when government decisions \u201ctouch upon an\nindividual\u2019s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a\njudicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear\non that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.\u201d Id., at 299.\n   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest\nthat could justify the consideration of race: the interest in\nthe educational benefits that flow from a diverse student\nbody. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a\ncompelling interest, because a university\u2019s \u201cbroad mission\n[of] education\u201d is incompatible with making the \u201cjudicial,\nlegislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or\nstatutory violations\u201d necessary to justify remedial racial\nclassification. Id., at 307\u2013309.\n   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,\nserves values beyond race alone, including enhanced class-\nroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and\nstereotypes. The academic mission of a university is\n\u201ca special concern of the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 312.\nPart of \u201c \u2018the business of a university [is] to provide that\natmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, exper-\niment, and creation,\u2019 \u201d and this in turn leads to the ques-\ntion of \u201c \u2018who may be admitted to study.\u2019 \u201d Sweezy v. New\nHampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Justice Powell\u2019s central point, however, was that this\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest in securing diversity\u2019s benefits, although a per-\nmissible objective, is complex. \u201cIt is not an interest in\nsimple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of\nthe student body is in effect guaranteed to be members\nof selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage\nan undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity\nthat furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a\nfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (separate\nopinion).\n   In Gratz, 539 U. S. 244, and Grutter, supra, the Court\nendorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut\u00ad\nter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the\neducational benefits of \u201cstudent body diversity is a compel-\nling state interest that can justify the use of race in uni-\nversity admissions.\u201d Id., at 325.\n   As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows\nonly if a clear precondition is met: The particular admis-\nsions process used for this objective is subject to judicial\nreview. Race may not be considered unless the admissions\nprocess can withstand strict scrutiny. \u201cNothing in Justice\nPowell\u2019s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may\nemploy whatever means it desires to achieve the stated\ngoal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by\nour strict scrutiny analysis.\u201d Gratz, supra, at 275. \u201cTo be\nnarrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program\ncannot use a quota system,\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 334, but\ninstead must \u201cremain flexible enough to ensure that each\napplicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way\nthat makes an applicant\u2019s race or ethnicity the defining\nfeature of his or her application,\u201d id., at 337. Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that\nits \u201cpurpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible\nand substantial, and that its use of the classification is\nnecessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.\u201d\n8        FISHER v.

(internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   While these are the cases that most specifically address\nthe central issue in this case, additional guidance may\nbe found in the Court\u2019s broader equal protection jurispru-\ndence which applies in this context. \u201cDistinctions between\ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very\nnature odious to a free people,\u201d Rice v.

S. 497, 499\n(1954). \u201c \u2018[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom pro-\nvide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,\u2019 \u201d Richmond\nv. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 505 (1989) (quoting\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 533\u2013534 (1980)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)), \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause\ndemands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the\n\u2018most rigid scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11\n(1967).\n   To implement these canons, judicial review must begin\nfrom the position that \u201cany official action that treats a\nperson differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is\ninherently suspect.\u201d Fullilove, supra, at 523 (Stewart, J.,\ndissenting); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192\n(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it\nis the government that bears the burden to prove \u201c \u2018that\nthe reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly iden-\ntified and unquestionably legitimate,\u2019 \u201d Croson, supra, at\n505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533\u2013535 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n                             II\n  Grutter made clear that racial \u201cclassifications are consti-\ntutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further com-\npelling governmental interests.\u201d 539 U. S., at 326. And\nGrutter endorsed Justice Powell\u2019s conclusion in Bakke that\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a consti-\ntutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher\neducation.\u201d 438 U. S., at 311\u2013312 (separate opinion).\nThus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied\nto any admissions program using racial categories or\nclassifications.\n   According to Grutter, a university\u2019s \u201ceducational judg-\nment that such diversity is essential to its educational\nmission is one to which we defer.\u201d 539 U. S., at 328.\nGrutter concluded that the decision to pursue \u201cthe educa-\ntional benefits that flow from student body diversity,\u201d id.,\nat 330, that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which\nsome, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under\nGrutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a\nreasoned, principled explanation for the academic deci-\nsion. On this point, the District Court and Court of\nAppeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-\nference to the University\u2019s conclusion, \u201c \u2018based on its\nexperience and expertise,\u2019 \u201d 631 F. 3d, at 230 (quoting 645\nF. Supp. 2d 587, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse stu-\ndent body would serve its educational goals. There is\ndisagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with\nthe principles of equal protection in approving this compel-\nling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring); post, at 4\u20135 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1\u20132\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not\nask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter\u2019s holding.\n   A university is not permitted to define diversity as\n\u201csome specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.\u201d Bakke, supra, at\n307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \u201cThat would amount to out-\nright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.\u201d\nGrutter, supra, at 330. \u201cRacial balancing is not trans-\nformed from \u2018patently unconstitutional\u2019 to a compelling\nstate interest simply by relabeling it \u2018racial diversity.\u2019 \u201d\n10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 732 (2007).\n  Once the University has established that its goal of di-\nversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there\nmust still be a further judicial determination that the\nadmissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implemen-\ntation. The University must prove that the means chosen\nby the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored\nto that goal. On this point, the University receives no\ndeference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not\nfor university administrators, to ensure that \u201c[t]he means\nchosen to accomplish the [government\u2019s] asserted purpose\nmust be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish\nthat purpose.\u201d 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). True, a court can take account of a university\u2019s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain\nadmissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it\nremains at all times the University\u2019s obligation to demon-\nstrate, and the Judiciary\u2019s obligation to determine, that\nadmissions processes \u201censure that each applicant is evalu-\nated as an individual and not in a way that makes an\napplicant\u2019s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or\nher application.\u201d Id., at 337.\n  Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court\nverify that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d for a university to use race\nto achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,\nsupra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into\nwhether a university could achieve sufficient diversity\nwithout using racial classifications. Although \u201c[n]arrow\ntailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,\u201d strict scrutiny does require a\ncourt to examine with care, and not defer to, a university\u2019s\n\u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.\u201d See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339\u2013340 (empha-\nsis added). Consideration by the university is of course\nnecessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-\ncational benefits of diversity. If \u201c \u2018a nonracial approach\n . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well\nand at tolerable administrative expense,\u2019 \u201d Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting\nGreenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of \u201cBenign\u201d Racial Prefer-\nence in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,\n578\u2013579 (1975)), then the university may not consider\nrace. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the\nvalidity of a university\u2019s adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-\nsity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to\nracial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral\nalternatives do not suffice.\n    Rather than perform this searching examination, how-\never, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge\nonly \u201cwhether [the University\u2019s] decision to reintroduce\nrace as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.\u201d\n631 F. 3d, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,\nthe court would \u201cpresume the University acted in good\nfaith\u201d and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that\npresumption. Id., at 231\u2013232. The Court of Appeals\nheld that to \u201csecond-guess the merits\u201d of this aspect of\nthe University\u2019s decision was a task it was \u201cill-equipped to\nperform\u201d and that it would attempt only to \u201censure that\n[the University\u2019s] decision to adopt a race-conscious ad-\nmissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith\nconsideration.\u201d Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus\nconcluded that \u201cthe narrow-tailoring inquiry\u2014like the\ncompelling-interest inquiry\u2014is undertaken with a degree\nof deference to the Universit[y].\u201d Id., at 232. Because \u201cthe\nefforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of\nhigh purpose,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that the use of\nrace in the admissions program fell within \u201ca constitution-\nally protected zone of discretion.\u201d Id., at 231.\n12       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    These expressions of the controlling standard are at\nodds with Grutter\u2019s command that \u201call racial classifica-\ntions imposed by government \u2018must be analyzed by a\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d 539 U. S., at 326\n(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S.\n200, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan\nat issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was\nsufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed\n\u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.\u201d 539 U. S., at 339. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court\ntherefore does not consider, the correctness of that\ndetermination.\n    Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an\nimpermissible consideration of race. It must be remem-\nbered that \u201cthe mere recitation of a \u2018benign\u2019 or legitimate\npurpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no\nweight.\u201d Croson, 488 U. S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does\nnot permit a court to accept a school\u2019s assertion that its\nadmissions process uses race in a permissible way without\na court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the\nprocess works in practice.\n    The higher education dynamic does not change the\nnarrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in\nother contexts. \u201c[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny ap-\nplied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do\nnot vary simply because the objective appears acceptable\n. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective\nmay affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself\ndoes not change.\u201d Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,\n458 U. S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982).\n    The District Court and Court of Appeals confined the\nstrict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring\nto the University\u2019s good faith in its use of racial classifica-\ntions and affirming the grant of summary judgment on\nthat basis. The Court vacates that judgment, but fairness\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires\nthat it be remanded so that the admissions process can\nbe considered and judged under a correct analysis. See\nAdarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided\nafter trial, this case arises from cross-motions for sum-\nmary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in de-\ntermining whether summary judgment in favor of the\nUniversity would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals\nmust assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence that would prove that its admissions program is\nnarrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of\ndiversity. Whether this record\u2014and not \u201csimple . . . as-\nsurances of good intention,\u201d Croson, supra, at 500\u2014is\nsufficient is a question for the Court of Appeals in the first\ninstance.\n                          *     *    *\n  Strict scrutiny must not be \u201c \u2018strict in theory, but fatal in\nfact,\u2019 \u201d Adarand, supra, at 237; see also Grutter, supra, at\n326. But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must\nnot be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judi-\ncial review to be meaningful, a university must make a\nshowing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the\nonly interest that this Court has approved in this context:\nthe benefits of a student body diversity that \u201cencompasses\na . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (opinion of\nPowell, J.). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is va-\ncated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n\n  JUSTICE KAGAN took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of this case.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Ante, at 1. I write sepa-\nrately to explain that I would overrule Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306 (2003), and hold that a State\u2019s use of race in\nhigher education admissions decisions is categorically\nprohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State\nshall \u201cdeny to any person . . . the equal protection of the\nlaws.\u201d The Equal Protection Clause guarantees every\nperson the right to be treated equally by the State, with-\nout regard to race. \u201cAt the heart of this [guarantee] lies\nthe principle that the government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic, or reli-\ngious groups.\u201d Missouri v.

Jenkins, supra, at 121 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). And rightly so. \u201cPurchased at the price of\nimmeasurable human suffering, the equal protection\nprinciple reflects our Nation\u2019s understanding that [racial]\nclassifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the\nindividual and our society.\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment). \u201cThe Constitution\nabhors classifications based on race\u201d because \u201cevery time\nthe government places citizens on racial registers and\nmakes race relevant to the provision of burdens or bene-\nfits, it demeans us all.\u201d Grutter, supra, at 353 (THOMAS,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n                              B\n                              1\n   The Court first articulated the strict-scrutiny standard\nin Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944).\nThere, we held that \u201c[p]ressing public necessity may some-\ntimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial\nantagonism never can.\u201d Id., at 216.1 Aside from Grutter,\nthe Court has recognized only two instances in which a\n\u201c[p]ressing public necessity\u201d may justify racial discrimina-\ntion by the government. First, in Korematsu, the Court\nrecognized that protecting national security may satisfy\nthis exacting standard. In that case, the Court upheld an\nevacuation order directed at \u201call persons of Japanese\nancestry\u201d on the grounds that the Nation was at war with\nJapan and that the order had \u201ca definite and close rela-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The standard of \u201cpressing public necessity\u201d is more frequently called\n\na \u201ccompelling governmental interest.\u201d I use the terms interchangeably.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Second, the Court has recognized that\nthe government has a compelling interest in remedying\npast discrimination for which it is responsible, but we\nhave stressed that a government wishing to use race must\nprovide \u201ca \u2018strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that\nremedial action [is] necessary.\u2019 \u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S. 469, 500, 504 (1989) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality\nopinion)).\n   In contrast to these compelling interests that may, in a\nnarrow set of circumstances, justify racial discrimination,\nthe Court has frequently found other asserted interests\ninsufficient. For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S.\n429 (1984), the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best\ninterests of a child justified the government\u2019s racial dis-\ncrimination. In that case, a state court awarded custody\nto a child\u2019s father because the mother was in a mixed-race\nmarriage. The state court believed the child might be\nstigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and\nsought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody\ndetermination. We acknowledged the possibility of stigma\nbut nevertheless concluded that \u201cthe reality of private\nbiases and the possible injury they might inflict\u201d do not\njustify racial discrimination. Id., at 433. As we explained,\n\u201cThe Constitution cannot control such prejudices but\nneither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be out-\nside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or\nindirectly, give them effect.\u201d Ibid.\n   Two years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that\neven asserted interests in remedying societal discrimina-\ntion and in providing role models for minority students\ncould not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimi-\nnation. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement\nbetween a school board and a teacher\u2019s union favored\nteachers who were \u201c \u2018Black, American Indian, Oriental, or\n4        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nof Spanish descendancy.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 270\u2013271, and n. 2 (plu-\nrality opinion). We rejected the interest in remedying\nsocietal discrimination because it had no logical stopping\npoint. Id., at 276. We similarly rebuffed as inadequate\nthe interest in providing role models to minority students\nand added that the notion that \u201cblack students are better\noff with black teachers could lead to the very system the\nCourt rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n483 (1954).\u201d Ibid.\n                              2\n   Grutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny\nprecedents. In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law\nSchool (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling\nreason to discriminate based on race. The reason it ad-\nvanced did not concern protecting national security or\nremedying its own past discrimination. Instead, the Law\nSchool argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions\ndecisions in order to obtain the \u201ceducational benefits that\nflow from a diverse student body.\u201d 539 U. S., at 317.\nContrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court\ndeferred to the Law School\u2019s determination that this inter-\nest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 325.\n   I dissented from that part of the Court\u2019s decision. I\nexplained that \u201conly those measures the State must take\nto provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent vio-\nlence, will constitute a \u2018pressing public necessity\u2019 \u201d suffi-\ncient to satisfy strict scrutiny. Id., at 353. Cf. Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, J., concur-\nring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify\nnarrowly tailored discrimination); J. A. Croson, supra, at\n521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cAt least where\nstate or local action is at issue, only a social emergency\nrising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb . . .\ncan justify [racial discrimination]\u201d).

As should be obvious, there is nothing \u201cpressing\u201d or\n\u201cnecessary\u201d about obtaining whatever educational benefits\nmay flow from racial diversity.\n                              II\n\n                               A\n\n   The University claims that the District Court found that\nit has a compelling interest in attaining \u201ca diverse stu-\ndent body and the educational benefits flowing from such\ndiversity.\u201d Brief for Respondents 18. The use of the con-\njunction, \u201cand,\u201d implies that the University believes its\ndiscrimination furthers two distinct interests. The first is\nan interest in attaining diversity for its own sake. The sec-\nond is an interest in attaining educational benefits that\nallegedly flow from diversity.\n   Attaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter. As\neven Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end\nis nothing more than impermissible \u201cracial balancing.\u201d\n539 U. S., at 329\u2013330 (\u201cThe Law School\u2019s interest is not\nsimply \u2018to assure within its student body some specified\npercentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin.\u2019 That would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional\u201d (quoting\nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v.

This the\nConstitution forbids\u201d). Rather, diversity can only be the\nmeans by which the University obtains educational benefits;\nit cannot be an end pursued for its own sake. Therefore,\nthe educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity\nmust rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order\nfor the program to survive strict scrutiny.\n   Unfortunately for the University, the educational bene-\nfits flowing from student body diversity\u2014assuming they\nexist\u2014hardly qualify as a compelling state interest. In-\n6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ndeed, the argument that educational benefits justify racial\ndiscrimination was advanced in support of racial segrega-\ntion in the 1950\u2019s, but emphatically rejected by this Court.\nAnd just as the alleged educational benefits of segregation\nwere insufficient to justify racial discrimination then, see\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the\nalleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify\nracial discrimination today.\n                               1\n   Our desegregation cases establish that the Constitution\nprohibits public schools from discriminating based on race,\neven if discrimination is necessary to the schools\u2019 survival.\nIn Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., decided with\nBrown, supra, the school board argued that if the Court\nfound segregation unconstitutional, white students would\nmigrate to private schools, funding for public schools\nwould decrease, and public schools would either decline in\nquality or cease to exist altogether.

We are up\nagainst the proposition: What does the Negro profit if he\nprocures an immediate detailed decree from this Court\nnow and then impairs or mars or destroys the public\nschool system in Prince Edward County\u201d).2\n   Unmoved by this sky-is-falling argument, we held that\nsegregation violates the principle of equality enshrined in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown, supra, at 495\n(\u201c[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of \u2018separate\nbut equal\u2019 has no place.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmay not be denied enforcement of rights to which he is\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States be-\ncause of action taken or threatened in defiance of such\nrights\u201d). Within a matter of years, the warning became\nreality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward\nCounty closed its public schools from the summer of 1959\nuntil the fall of 1964. See R. Sarratt, The Ordeal of De-\nsegregation 237 (1966). Despite this fact, the Court never\nbacked down from its rigid enforcement of the Equal\nProtection Clause\u2019s antidiscrimination principle.\n   In this case, of course, Texas has not alleged that the\nUniversity will close if it is prohibited from discriminating\nbased on race. But even if it had, the foregoing cases\nmake clear that even that consequence would not justify\nits use of racial discrimination. It follows, a fortiori, that\nthe putative educational benefits of student body diversity\ncannot justify racial discrimination: If a State does not\nhave a compelling interest in the existence of a university,\nit certainly cannot have a compelling interest in the sup-\nposed benefits that might accrue to that university from\nracial discrimination. See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 361 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J.) (\u201c[A] marginal improvement in legal\neducation cannot justify racial discrimination where the\nLaw School has no compelling interest either in its exis-\ntence or in its current educational and admissions poli-\ncies\u201d). If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny,\nit would require Texas either to close the University or to\nstop discriminating against applicants based on their race.\nThe Court has put other schools to that choice, and there\nis no reason to treat the University differently.\n                            2\n  It is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases,\nwe rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those\nadvanced by the University today.

See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity \u201cpre-\npares students to become the next generation of leaders in\nan increasingly diverse society\u201d). The segregationists\nlikewise defended segregation on the ground that it pro-\nvided more leadership opportunities for blacks. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Respondents in Sweatt 96 (\u201c[A] very large group\nof Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate\ncolleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as\nwell-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the\nseparate college offers him positive advantages; that there\nis a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate\ncollege; that there is a greater opportunity for full partici-\npation and for the development of leadership; that the\nNegro is inwardly more \u2018secure\u2019 at a college of his own\npeople\u201d); Brief for Appellees in Davis 25\u201326 (\u201cThe Negro\nchild gets an opportunity to participate in segregated\nschools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-\nsegregated schools. He is important, he holds offices, he\nis accepted by his fellows, he is on athletic teams, he has\na full place there\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nThis argument was unavailing. It is irrelevant under the\nFourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed\nschools produce better leaders. Indeed, no court today\nwould accept the suggestion that segregation is permissi-\nble because historically black colleges produced Booker T.\nWashington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nand other prominent leaders. Likewise, the University\u2019s\nracial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground\nthat it will produce better leaders.\n   The University also asserts that student body diversity\nimproves interracial relations. See, e.g., Brief for Re-\nspondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes\n\u201ccross-racial understanding\u201d and breaks down racial and\nethnic stereotypes). In this argument, too, the University\n10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nrepeats arguments once marshaled in support of segrega-\ntion.

Nevertheless, despite\nrejecting identical arguments in Brown, the Court in\nGrutter deferred to the University\u2019s determination that\nthe diversity obtained by racial discrimination would yield\neducational benefits. There is no principled distinction\nbetween the University\u2019s assertion that diversity yields\neducational benefits and the segregationists\u2019 assertion\nthat segregation yielded those same benefits. See Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 365\u2013366 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)

All applicants must be treated equally\nunder the law, and no benefit in the eye of the beholder can\njustify racial discrimination.\n   This principle is neither new nor difficult to understand.\nIn 1868, decades before Plessy, the Iowa Supreme Court\nheld that schools may not discriminate against applicants\nbased on their skin color. In Clark v.

This simple, yet funda-\nmental, truth was lost on the Court in Plessy and Grutter.\n  I would overrule Grutter and hold that the University\u2019s\nadmissions program violates the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause the University has not put forward a compelling\ninterest that could possibly justify racial discrimination.\n                              III\n   While I find the theory advanced by the University to\njustify racial discrimination facially inadequate, I also\nbelieve that its use of race has little to do with the alleged\neducational benefits of diversity. I suspect that the Uni-\nversity\u2019s program is instead based on the benighted notion\nthat it is possible to tell when discrimination helps, rather\nthan hurts, racial minorities.

The University\u2019s professed good intentions can-\nnot excuse its outright racial discrimination any more\nthan such intentions justified the now denounced argu-\nments of slaveholders and segregationists.\n                             B\n  While it does not, for constitutional purposes, matter\nwhether the University\u2019s racial discrimination is benign, I\nnote that racial engineering does in fact have insidious\nconsequences. There can be no doubt that the University\u2019s\ndiscrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are\ndenied admission because of their race. But I believe the\ninjury to those admitted under the University\u2019s discrimi-\nnatory admissions program is even more harmful.\n  Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a\nresult of racial discrimination are, on average, far less\nprepared than their white and Asian classmates. In the\nUniversity\u2019s entering class of 2009, for example, among\nthe students admitted outside the Top Ten Percent plan,\nblacks scored at the 52d percentile of 2009 SAT takers\nnationwide, while Asians scored at the 93d percentile.\nBrief for Richard Sander et al. as Amici Curiae 3\u20134, and\nn. 4. Blacks had a mean GPA of 2.57 and a mean SAT\nscore of 1524; Hispanics had a mean GPA of 2.83 and a\nmean SAT score of 1794; whites had a mean GPA of 3.04\nand a mean SAT score of 1914; and Asians had a mean\nGPA of 3.07 and a mean SAT score of 1991.4 Ibid.\n  Tellingly, neither the University nor any of the 73 amici\nbriefs in support of racial discrimination has presented a\nshred of evidence that black and Hispanic students are\nable to close this substantial gap during their time at the\nUniversity. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on\nthe Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605\u20131608\n(1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial dis-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The lowest possible score on the SAT is 600, and the highest possi-\n\nble score is 2400.\n18       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ncrimination in admissions to consider the fact that its\n\u201cbeneficiaries\u201d are underperforming in the classroom). \u201cIt\nis a fact that in virtually all selective schools . . . where\nracial preferences in admission is practiced, the majority\nof [black] students end up in the lower quarter of their\nclass.\u201d S. Cole & E. Barber, Increasing Faculty Diversity:\nThe Occupational Choices of High-Achieving Minority\nStudents 124 (2003). There is no reason to believe this is\nnot the case at the University. The University and its\ndozens of amici are deafeningly silent on this point.\n   Furthermore, the University\u2019s discrimination does\nnothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics\nwho have access to a college education generally. Instead,\nthe University\u2019s discrimination has a pervasive shifting\neffect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the\nWorld 145\u2013146 (2004). The University admits minorities\nwho otherwise would have attended less selective colleges\nwhere they would have been more evenly matched. But,\nas a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispan-\nics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are\nplaced in a position where underperformance is all but\ninevitable because they are less academically prepared\nthan the white and Asian students with whom they must\ncompete. Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-\nconfidence of these overmatched students, there is no\nevidence that they learn more at the University than they\nwould have learned at other schools for which they were\nbetter prepared. Indeed, they may learn less.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that the University needed\nto enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained\n\u201cclustered in certain programs.\u201d 631 F. 3d 213, 240\n(CA5 2011) (\u201c[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate\nstudents in [the University\u2019s] College of Social Work are\nHispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

There is some\nevidence that students admitted as a result of racial dis-\ncrimination are more likely to abandon their initial aspi-\nrations to become scientists and engineers than are\nstudents with similar qualifications who attend less selective\nschools. See, e.g., Elliott, Strenta, Adair, Matier, & Scott,\nThe Role of Ethnicity in Choosing and Leaving Science in\nHighly Selective Institutions, 37 Research in Higher Educ.\n681, 699\u2013701 (1996).5 These students may well drift\ntowards less competitive majors because the mismatch\ncaused by racial discrimination in admissions makes it\ndifficult for them to compete in more rigorous majors.\n   Moreover, the University\u2019s discrimination \u201cstamp[s]\n[blacks and Hispanics] with a badge of inferiority.\u201d\nAdarand, 515 U. S., at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). It\ntaints the accomplishments of all those who are admitted\nas a result of racial discrimination. Cf. J. McWhorter,\nLosing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America 248\n(2000) (\u201cI was never able to be as proud of getting into\nStanford as my classmates could be. . . .

In this case, for example, most blacks and Hispanics\nattending the University were admitted without discrimina-\ntion under the Top Ten Percent plan, but no one can\ndistinguish those students from the ones whose race\nplayed a role in their admission. \u201cWhen blacks [and His-\npanics] take positions in the highest places of government,\nindustry, or academia, it is an open question . . . whether\ntheir skin color played a part in their advancement.\u201d See\nGrutter, 539 U.

S. 265, 316\u2013317 (1978). The University has\nsteered clear of a quota system like the one struck down in\nBakke, which excluded all nonminority candidates from\ncompetition for a fixed number of seats.

Supp. 2d 587, 609 (WD Tex. 2009) (\u201c[T]he parties agree\n[that the University\u2019s] policy was based on the [admis-\nsions] policy [upheld in Grutter].\u201d).\n   Petitioner urges that Texas\u2019 Top Ten Percent Law and\nrace-blind holistic review of each application achieve\nsignificant diversity, so the University must be content\nwith those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate\nhere that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly\nneutral alternatives as race unconscious. See Gratz, 539\nU. S., at 303\u2013304, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). As Justice\nSouter observed, the vaunted alternatives suffer from \u201cthe\ndisadvantage of deliberate obfuscation.\u201d Id., at 297\u2013298\n(dissenting opinion).\n   Texas\u2019 percentage plan was adopted with racially segre-\ngated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.\nSee House Research Organization, Bill Analysis, HB 588,\npp. 4\u20135 (Apr. 15, 1997) (\u201cMany regions of the state, school\ndistricts, and high schools in Texas are still predominantly\ncomposed of people from a single racial or ethnic group.\nBecause of the persistence of this segregation, admitting\nthe top 10 percent of all high schools would provide a\ndiverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified\npool of minority students was admitted to Texas universi-\nties.\u201d). It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that\ndrives such plans.2 As for holistic review, if universities\ncannot explicitly include race as a factor, many may \u201cre-\nsort to camouflage\u201d to \u201cmaintain their minority enroll-\nment.\u201d Gratz, 539 U.

S., at 305, n. 11 (dissenting opinion).\n   Accordingly, I would not return this case for a second\nlook. As the thorough opinions below show, 631 F. 3d 213\n(CA5 2011); 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, the University\u2019s admis-\nsions policy flexibly considers race only as a \u201cfactor of a\nfactor of a factor of a factor\u201d in the calculus, id., at 608;\nfollowed a yearlong review through which the University\nreached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that suppos-\nedly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,\nin appropriate measure, the educational benefits of student-\nbody diversity, see 631 F. 3d, at 225\u2013226; and is sub-\nject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of\nrace remains necessary and proper to achieve the Uni-\nversity\u2019s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice\nPowell\u2019s opinion in Bakke and the Court\u2019s decision in\nGrutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.

I do not read the Court to\nsay otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter\u2019s narrow-\ntailoring requirement, \u201ca court can take account of a university\u2019s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions\nprocesses\u201d).\n4         FISHER v.

Yet it\nstops short of reaching the conclusion that framework\nwarrants.

As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already\ncompleted that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this\nCourt\u2019s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our\napprobation.4\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Because the University\u2019s admissions policy, in my view, is constitu-\n\ntional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case \u201cto\nrevisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether\ndesigned to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,\nshould be subject to the same standard of judicial review.\u201d 539 U.

Argued October 10, 2012\u2014Decided June 24, 2013\nThe University of Texas at Austin considers race as one of various fac-\n  tors in its undergraduate admissions process. The University, which\n  is committed to increasing racial minority enrollment, adopted its\n  current program after this Court decided Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\n  U. S. 306, upholding the use of race as one of many \u201cplus factors\u201d in\n  an admissions program that considered the overall individual contri-\n  bution of each candidate, and decided Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n  244, holding unconstitutional an admissions program that automati-\n  cally awarded points to applicants from certain racial minorities.\n     Petitioner, who is Caucasian, was rejected for admission to the\n  University\u2019s 2008 entering class. She sued the University and school\n  officials, alleging that the University\u2019s consideration of race in admis-\n  sions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court\n  granted summary judgment to the University. Affirming, the Fifth\n  Circuit held that Grutter required courts to give substantial defer-\n  ence to the University, both in the definition of the compelling inter-\n  est in diversity\u2019s benefits and in deciding whether its specific plan\n  was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal. Applying that\n  standard, the court upheld the University\u2019s admissions plan.\nHeld: Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the University to the de-\n manding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Regents\n of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, its decision affirming the Dis-\n trict Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the University was incor-\n rect. Pp. 5\u201313.\n    (a) Bakke, Gratz, and Grutter, which directly address the question\n considered here, are taken as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n In Bakke\u2019s principal opinion, Justice Powell recognized that state\n university \u201cdecisions based on race or ethnic origin . . . are reviewable\n2           FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    under the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d 438 U. S., at 287, using a strict\n    scrutiny standard, id., at 299. He identified as a compelling interest\n    that could justify the consideration of race the interest in the educa-\n    tional benefits that flow from a diverse student body, but noted that\n    this interest is complex, encompassing a broad array \u201cof qualifica-\n    tions and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a sin-\n    gle though important element.\u201d Id., at 315\n       In Gratz and Grutter, the Court endorsed these precepts, observing\n    that an admissions process with such an interest is subject to judicial\n    review and must withstand strict scrutiny, Gratz, supra, at 275, i.e.,\n    a university must clearly demonstrate that its \u201c \u2018purpose or interest is\n    both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of\n    the classification is \u201cnecessary . . . to the accomplishment\u201d of its pur-\n    pose,\u2019 \u201d Bakke, supra, at 305. Additional guidance may be found in\n    the Court\u2019s broader equal protection jurisprudence. See, e.g., Rice v.\n    Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 517; Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.\n    469, 505. Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and the gov-\n    ernment bears the burden to prove \u201c \u2018that the reasons for any [racial]\n    classification [are] clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate.\u2019 \u201d\n    Ibid. Pp. 5\u20138.\n       (b) Under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admis-\n    sions program using racial categories or classifications. A court may\n    give some deference to a university\u2019s \u201cjudgment that such diversity is\n    essential to its educational mission,\u201d 539 U. S., at 328, provided that\n    diversity is not defined as mere racial balancing and there is a rea-\n    soned, principled explanation for the academic decision. On this\n    point, the courts below were correct in finding that Grutter calls for\n    deference to the University\u2019s experience and expertise about its edu-\n    cational mission. However, once the University has established that\n    its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, the University\n    must prove that the means it chose to attain that diversity are nar-\n    rowly tailored to its goal. On this point, the University receives no\n    deference. Id., at 333. It is at all times the University\u2019s obligation to\n    demonstrate, and the Judiciary\u2019s obligation to determine, that admis-\n    sions processes \u201censure that each applicant is evaluated as an indi-\n    vidual and not in a way that makes an applicant\u2019s race or ethnicity\n    the defining feature of his or her application.\u201d Id., at 337. Narrow\n    tailoring also requires a reviewing court to verify that it is \u201cneces-\n    sary\u201d for the university to use race to achieve the educational benefits\n    of diversity. Bakke, supra, at 305. The reviewing court must ulti-\n    mately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would\n    produce the educational benefits of diversity.\n       Rather than perform this searching examination, the Fifth Circuit\n    held petitioner could challenge only whether the University\u2019s decision\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  to use race as an admissions factor \u201cwas made in good faith.\u201d It pre-\n  sumed that the school had acted in good faith and gave petitioner the\n  burden of rebutting that presumption. It thus undertook the narrow-\n  tailoring requirement with a \u201cdegree of deference\u201d to the school.\n  These expressions of the controlling standard are at odds with Grut-\n  ter\u2019s command that \u201call racial classifications imposed by government\n  \u2018must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d 539\n  U. S., at 326. Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a\n  school\u2019s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissi-\n  ble way without closely examining how the process works in practice,\n  yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The\n  Court vacates the Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment. But fairness to the liti-\n  gants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded\n  so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a\n  correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the\n  University\u2019s favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess\n  whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that\n  its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational\n  benefits of diversity.

It refers\nto this goal as a \u201ccritical mass.\u201d Petitioner, who is Cauca-\nsian, sued the University after her application was re-\njected. She contends that the University\u2019s use of race in\nthe admissions process violated the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   The parties asked the Court to review whether the\njudgment below was consistent with \u201cthis Court\u2019s deci-\nsions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 306 (2003).\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. The Court concludes\nthat the Court of Appeals did not hold the University\nto the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated\nin Grutter and Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nscrutiny, its decision affirming the District Court\u2019s grant\nof summary judgment to the University was incorrect.\nThat decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for\nfurther proceedings.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Located in Austin, Texas, on the most renowned campus\nof the Texas state university system, the University is one\nof the leading institutions of higher education in the Na-\ntion. Admission is prized and competitive. In 2008, when\npetitioner sought admission to the University\u2019s entering\nclass, she was 1 of 29,501 applicants. From this group\n12,843 were admitted, and 6,715 accepted and enrolled.\nPetitioner was denied admission.\n   In recent years the University has used three different\nprograms to evaluate candidates for admission. The first\nis the program it used for some years before 1997, when\nthe University considered two factors: a numerical score\nreflecting an applicant\u2019s test scores and academic perform-\nance in high school (Academic Index or AI), and the\napplicant\u2019s race. In 1996, this system was held unconsti-\ntutional by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit. It ruled the University\u2019s consideration of\nrace violated the Equal Protection Clause because it did\nnot further any compelling government interest. Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F. 3d 932, 955 (1996).\n   The second program was adopted to comply with the\nHopwood decision. The University stopped considering\nrace in admissions and substituted instead a new holistic\nmetric of a candidate\u2019s potential contribution to the Uni-\nversity, to be used in conjunction with the Academic In-\ndex. This \u201cPersonal Achievement Index\u201d (PAI) measures a\nstudent\u2019s leadership and work experience, awards, extra-\ncurricular activities, community service, and other special\ncircumstances that give insight into a student\u2019s back-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nground. These included growing up in a single-parent\nhome, speaking a language other than English at home,\nsignificant family responsibilities assumed by the appli-\ncant, and the general socioeconomic condition of the stu-\ndent\u2019s family. Seeking to address the decline in minority\nenrollment after Hopwood, the University also expanded\nits outreach programs.\n   The Texas State Legislature also responded to the Hop\u00ad\nwood decision. It enacted a measure known as the Top\nTen Percent Law, codified at Tex. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a751.803\n(West 2009). Also referred to as H. B. 588, the Top\nTen Percent Law grants automatic admission to any pub-\nlic state college, including the University, to all students\nin the top 10% of their class at high schools in Texas\nthat comply with certain standards.\n   The University\u2019s revised admissions process, coupled\nwith the operation of the Top Ten Percent Law, resulted in\na more racially diverse environment at the University.\nBefore the admissions program at issue in this case, in the\nlast year under the post-Hopwood AI/PAI system that did\nnot consider race, the entering class was 4.5% African-\nAmerican and 16.9% Hispanic. This is in contrast with\nthe 1996 pre-Hopwood and Top Ten Percent regime, when\nrace was explicitly considered, and the University\u2019s enter-\ning freshman class was 4.1% African-American and 14.5%\nHispanic.\n   Following this Court\u2019s decisions in Grutter v. Bollinger,\nsupra, and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), the\nUniversity adopted a third admissions program, the 2004\nprogram in which the University reverted to explicit con-\nsideration of race. This is the program here at issue. In\nGrutter, the Court upheld the use of race as one of many\n\u201cplus factors\u201d in an admissions program that considered\nthe overall individual contribution of each candidate. In\nGratz, by contrast, the Court held unconstitutional Michi-\ngan\u2019s undergraduate admissions program, which automat-\n4       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nically awarded points to applicants from certain racial\nminorities.\n   The University\u2019s plan to resume race-conscious admis-\nsions was given formal expression in June 2004 in an in-\nternal document entitled Proposal to Consider Race and\nEthnicity in Admissions (Proposal). Supp. App. 1a. The\nProposal relied in substantial part on a study of a subset\nof undergraduate classes containing between 5 and 24\nstudents. It showed that few of these classes had signifi-\ncant enrollment by members of racial minorities. In addi-\ntion the Proposal relied on what it called \u201canecdotal\u201d\nreports from students regarding their \u201cinteraction in the\nclassroom.\u201d The Proposal concluded that the University\nlacked a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students and that to\nremedy the deficiency it was necessary to give explicit\nconsideration to race in the undergraduate admissions\nprogram.\n   To implement the Proposal the University included a\nstudent\u2019s race as a component of the PAI score, begin-\nning with applicants in the fall of 2004. The University\nasks students to classify themselves from among five\npredefined racial categories on the application. Race is not\nassigned an explicit numerical value, but it is undisputed\nthat race is a meaningful factor.\n   Once applications have been scored, they are plotted\non a grid with the Academic Index on the x-axis and the\nPersonal Achievement Index on the y-axis. On that grid\nstudents are assigned to so-called cells based on their\nindividual scores. All students in the cells falling above a\ncertain line are admitted. All students below the line are\nnot. Each college\u2014such as Liberal Arts or Engineering\u2014\nadmits students separately. So a student is considered\ninitially for her first-choice college, then for her second\nchoice, and finally for general admission as an undeclared\nmajor.\n   Petitioner applied for admission to the University\u2019s 2008\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

She sued the University\nand various University officials in the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Texas. She alleged\nthat the University\u2019s consideration of race in admissions\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. The parties cross-\nmoved for summary judgment. The District Court granted\nsummary judgment to the University. The United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. It held\nthat Grutter required courts to give substantial deference\nto the University, both in the definition of the compelling\ninterest in diversity\u2019s benefits and in deciding whether its\nspecific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated\ngoal. Applying that standard, the court upheld the Uni-\nversity\u2019s admissions plan. 631 F. 3d 213, 217\u2013218 (2011).\n   Over the dissent of seven judges, the Court of Appeals\ndenied petitioner\u2019s request for rehearing en banc. See 644\nF. 3d 301, 303 (CA5 2011) (per curiam). Petitioner sought\na writ of certiorari. The writ was granted. 565 U. S. ___\n(2012).\n                              B\n  Among the Court\u2019s cases involving racial classifications\nin education, there are three decisions that directly ad-\ndress the question of considering racial minority status as\na positive or favorable factor in a university\u2019s admissions\nprocess, with the goal of achieving the educational benefits\nof a more diverse student body: Bakke, 438 U. S. 265;\nGratz, supra; and Grutter, 539 U. S. 306. We take those\ncases as given for purposes of deciding this case.\n  We begin with the principal opinion authored by Justice\nPowell in Bakke, supra. In Bakke, the Court considered\na system used by the medical school of the University of\nCalifornia at Davis. From an entering class of 100 stu-\ndents the school had set aside 16 seats for minority appli-\ncants. In holding this program impermissible under the\nEqual Protection Clause Justice Powell\u2019s opinion stated\n6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncertain basic premises. First, \u201cdecisions based on race\nor ethnic origin by faculties and administrations of state\nuniversities are reviewable under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.\u201d Id., at 287 (separate opinion). The principle\nof equal protection admits no \u201cartificial line of a \u2018two-\nclass theory\u2019 \u201d that \u201cpermits the recognition of special\nwards entitled to a degree of protection greater than that\naccorded others.\u201d Id., at 295. It is therefore irrelevant\nthat a system of racial preferences in admissions may\nseem benign. Any racial classification must meet strict\nscrutiny, for when government decisions \u201ctouch upon an\nindividual\u2019s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a\njudicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear\non that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernmental interest.\u201d Id., at 299.\n   Next, Justice Powell identified one compelling interest\nthat could justify the consideration of race: the interest in\nthe educational benefits that flow from a diverse student\nbody. Redressing past discrimination could not serve as a\ncompelling interest, because a university\u2019s \u201cbroad mission\n[of] education\u201d is incompatible with making the \u201cjudicial,\nlegislative, or administrative findings of constitutional or\nstatutory violations\u201d necessary to justify remedial racial\nclassification. Id., at 307\u2013309.\n   The attainment of a diverse student body, by contrast,\nserves values beyond race alone, including enhanced class-\nroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and\nstereotypes. The academic mission of a university is\n\u201ca special concern of the First Amendment.\u201d Id., at 312.\nPart of \u201c \u2018the business of a university [is] to provide that\natmosphere which is most conducive to speculation, exper-\niment, and creation,\u2019 \u201d and this in turn leads to the ques-\ntion of \u201c \u2018who may be admitted to study.\u2019 \u201d Sweezy v. New\nHampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frankfurter, J.,\nconcurring in judgment).\n   Justice Powell\u2019s central point, however, was that this\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ninterest in securing diversity\u2019s benefits, although a per-\nmissible objective, is complex. \u201cIt is not an interest in\nsimple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of\nthe student body is in effect guaranteed to be members\nof selected ethnic groups, with the remaining percentage\nan undifferentiated aggregation of students. The diversity\nthat furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a\nfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.\u201d Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315 (separate\nopinion).\n   In Gratz, 539 U. S. 244, and Grutter, supra, the Court\nendorsed the precepts stated by Justice Powell. In Grut\u00ad\nter, the Court reaffirmed his conclusion that obtaining the\neducational benefits of \u201cstudent body diversity is a compel-\nling state interest that can justify the use of race in uni-\nversity admissions.\u201d Id., at 325.\n   As Gratz and Grutter observed, however, this follows\nonly if a clear precondition is met: The particular admis-\nsions process used for this objective is subject to judicial\nreview. Race may not be considered unless the admissions\nprocess can withstand strict scrutiny. \u201cNothing in Justice\nPowell\u2019s opinion in Bakke signaled that a university may\nemploy whatever means it desires to achieve the stated\ngoal of diversity without regard to the limits imposed by\nour strict scrutiny analysis.\u201d Gratz, supra, at 275. \u201cTo be\nnarrowly tailored, a race-conscious admissions program\ncannot use a quota system,\u201d Grutter, 539 U. S., at 334, but\ninstead must \u201cremain flexible enough to ensure that each\napplicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way\nthat makes an applicant\u2019s race or ethnicity the defining\nfeature of his or her application,\u201d id., at 337. Strict scru-\ntiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that\nits \u201cpurpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible\nand substantial, and that its use of the classification is\nnecessary . . . to the accomplishment of its purpose.\u201d\n8        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nBakke, 438 U. S., at 305 (opinion of Powell, J.) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n   While these are the cases that most specifically address\nthe central issue in this case, additional guidance may\nbe found in the Court\u2019s broader equal protection jurispru-\ndence which applies in this context. \u201cDistinctions between\ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very\nnature odious to a free people,\u201d Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U. S.\n495, 517 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), and\ntherefore \u201care contrary to our traditions and hence consti-\ntutionally suspect,\u201d Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499\n(1954). \u201c \u2018[B]ecause racial characteristics so seldom pro-\nvide a relevant basis for disparate treatment,\u2019 \u201d Richmond\nv. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 505 (1989) (quoting\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 533\u2013534 (1980)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)), \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause\ndemands that racial classifications . . . be subjected to the\n\u2018most rigid scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 11\n(1967).\n   To implement these canons, judicial review must begin\nfrom the position that \u201cany official action that treats a\nperson differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is\ninherently suspect.\u201d Fullilove, supra, at 523 (Stewart, J.,\ndissenting); McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 192\n(1964). Strict scrutiny is a searching examination, and it\nis the government that bears the burden to prove \u201c \u2018that\nthe reasons for any [racial] classification [are] clearly iden-\ntified and unquestionably legitimate,\u2019 \u201d Croson, supra, at\n505 (quoting Fullilove, 448 supra, at 533\u2013535 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n                             II\n  Grutter made clear that racial \u201cclassifications are consti-\ntutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further com-\npelling governmental interests.\u201d 539 U. S., at 326. And\nGrutter endorsed Justice Powell\u2019s conclusion in Bakke that\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cthe attainment of a diverse student body . . . is a consti-\ntutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher\neducation.\u201d 438 U. S., at 311\u2013312 (separate opinion).\nThus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied\nto any admissions program using racial categories or\nclassifications.\n   According to Grutter, a university\u2019s \u201ceducational judg-\nment that such diversity is essential to its educational\nmission is one to which we defer.\u201d 539 U. S., at 328.\nGrutter concluded that the decision to pursue \u201cthe educa-\ntional benefits that flow from student body diversity,\u201d id.,\nat 330, that the University deems integral to its mission\nis, in substantial measure, an academic judgment to which\nsome, but not complete, judicial deference is proper under\nGrutter. A court, of course, should ensure that there is a\nreasoned, principled explanation for the academic deci-\nsion. On this point, the District Court and Court of\nAppeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for de-\nference to the University\u2019s conclusion, \u201c \u2018based on its\nexperience and expertise,\u2019 \u201d 631 F. 3d, at 230 (quoting </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/txwd/8FrE/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (WD Tex. 2009)), that a diverse stu-\ndent body would serve its educational goals. There is\ndisagreement about whether Grutter was consistent with\nthe principles of equal protection in approving this compel-\nling interest in diversity. See post, at 1 (SCALIA, J., con-\ncurring); post, at 4\u20135 (THOMAS, J., concurring); post, at 1\u20132\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting). But the parties here do not\nask the Court to revisit that aspect of Grutter\u2019s holding.\n   A university is not permitted to define diversity as\n\u201csome specified percentage of a particular group merely\nbecause of its race or ethnic origin.\u201d Bakke, supra, at\n307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \u201cThat would amount to out-\nright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.\u201d\nGrutter, supra, at 330. \u201cRacial balancing is not trans-\nformed from \u2018patently unconstitutional\u2019 to a compelling\nstate interest simply by relabeling it \u2018racial diversity.\u2019 \u201d\n10       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1, 551 U. S. 701, 732 (2007).\n  Once the University has established that its goal of di-\nversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, however, there\nmust still be a further judicial determination that the\nadmissions process meets strict scrutiny in its implemen-\ntation. The University must prove that the means chosen\nby the University to attain diversity are narrowly tailored\nto that goal. On this point, the University receives no\ndeference. Grutter made clear that it is for the courts, not\nfor university administrators, to ensure that \u201c[t]he means\nchosen to accomplish the [government\u2019s] asserted purpose\nmust be specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish\nthat purpose.\u201d 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). True, a court can take account of a university\u2019s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain\nadmissions processes. But, as the Court said in Grutter, it\nremains at all times the University\u2019s obligation to demon-\nstrate, and the Judiciary\u2019s obligation to determine, that\nadmissions processes \u201censure that each applicant is evalu-\nated as an individual and not in a way that makes an\napplicant\u2019s race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or\nher application.\u201d Id., at 337.\n  Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court\nverify that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d for a university to use race\nto achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Bakke,\nsupra, at 305. This involves a careful judicial inquiry into\nwhether a university could achieve sufficient diversity\nwithout using racial classifications. Although \u201c[n]arrow\ntailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,\u201d strict scrutiny does require a\ncourt to examine with care, and not defer to, a university\u2019s\n\u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.\u201d See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 339\u2013340 (empha-\nsis added). Consideration by the university is of course\nnecessary, but it is not sufficient to satisfy strict scrutiny:\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThe reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no\nworkable race-neutral alternatives would produce the edu-\ncational benefits of diversity. If \u201c \u2018a nonracial approach\n . . . could promote the substantial interest about as well\nand at tolerable administrative expense,\u2019 \u201d Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 280, n. 6 (1986) (quoting\nGreenawalt, Judicial Scrutiny of \u201cBenign\u201d Racial Prefer-\nence in Law School Admissions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 559,\n578\u2013579 (1975)), then the university may not consider\nrace. A plaintiff, of course, bears the burden of placing the\nvalidity of a university\u2019s adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in issue. But strict scrutiny imposes on the univer-\nsity the ultimate burden of demonstrating, before turning to\nracial classifications, that available, workable race-neutral\nalternatives do not suffice.\n    Rather than perform this searching examination, how-\never, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge\nonly \u201cwhether [the University\u2019s] decision to reintroduce\nrace as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.\u201d\n631 F. 3d, at 236. And in considering such a challenge,\nthe court would \u201cpresume the University acted in good\nfaith\u201d and place on petitioner the burden of rebutting that\npresumption. Id., at 231\u2013232. The Court of Appeals\nheld that to \u201csecond-guess the merits\u201d of this aspect of\nthe University\u2019s decision was a task it was \u201cill-equipped to\nperform\u201d and that it would attempt only to \u201censure that\n[the University\u2019s] decision to adopt a race-conscious ad-\nmissions policy followed from [a process of] good faith\nconsideration.\u201d Id., at 231. The Court of Appeals thus\nconcluded that \u201cthe narrow-tailoring inquiry\u2014like the\ncompelling-interest inquiry\u2014is undertaken with a degree\nof deference to the Universit[y].\u201d Id., at 232. Because \u201cthe\nefforts of the University have been studied, serious, and of\nhigh purpose,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that the use of\nrace in the admissions program fell within \u201ca constitution-\nally protected zone of discretion.\u201d Id., at 231.\n12       FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    These expressions of the controlling standard are at\nodds with Grutter\u2019s command that \u201call racial classifica-\ntions imposed by government \u2018must be analyzed by a\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d 539 U. S., at 326\n(quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S.\n200, 227 (1995)). In Grutter, the Court approved the plan\nat issue upon concluding that it was not a quota, was\nsufficiently flexible, was limited in time, and followed\n\u201cserious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives.\u201d 539 U. S., at 339. As noted above, see\nsupra, at 1, the parties do not challenge, and the Court\ntherefore does not consider, the correctness of that\ndetermination.\n    Grutter did not hold that good faith would forgive an\nimpermissible consideration of race. It must be remem-\nbered that \u201cthe mere recitation of a \u2018benign\u2019 or legitimate\npurpose for a racial classification is entitled to little or no\nweight.\u201d Croson, 488 U. S., at 500. Strict scrutiny does\nnot permit a court to accept a school\u2019s assertion that its\nadmissions process uses race in a permissible way without\na court giving close analysis to the evidence of how the\nprocess works in practice.\n    The higher education dynamic does not change the\nnarrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in\nother contexts. \u201c[T]he analysis and level of scrutiny ap-\nplied to determine the validity of [a racial] classification do\nnot vary simply because the objective appears acceptable\n. . . . While the validity and importance of the objective\nmay affect the outcome of the analysis, the analysis itself\ndoes not change.\u201d Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan,\n458 U. S. 718, 724, n. 9 (1982).\n    The District Court and Court of Appeals confined the\nstrict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring\nto the University\u2019s good faith in its use of racial classifica-\ntions and affirming the grant of summary judgment on\nthat basis. The Court vacates that judgment, but fairness\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nto the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires\nthat it be remanded so that the admissions process can\nbe considered and judged under a correct analysis. See\nAdarand, supra, at 237. Unlike Grutter, which was decided\nafter trial, this case arises from cross-motions for sum-\nmary judgment. In this case, as in similar cases, in de-\ntermining whether summary judgment in favor of the\nUniversity would be appropriate, the Court of Appeals\nmust assess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence that would prove that its admissions program is\nnarrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of\ndiversity. Whether this record\u2014and not \u201csimple . . . as-\nsurances of good intention,\u201d Croson, supra, at 500\u2014is\nsufficient is a question for the Court of Appeals in the first\ninstance.\n                          *     *    *\n  Strict scrutiny must not be \u201c \u2018strict in theory, but fatal in\nfact,\u2019 \u201d Adarand, supra, at 237; see also Grutter, supra, at\n326. But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must\nnot be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judi-\ncial review to be meaningful, a university must make a\nshowing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the\nonly interest that this Court has approved in this context:\nthe benefits of a student body diversity that \u201cencompasses\na . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though im-\nportant element.\u201d Bakke, 438 U.

Ante, at 1. I write sepa-\nrately to explain that I would overrule Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306 (2003), and hold that a State\u2019s use of race in\nhigher education admissions decisions is categorically\nprohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State\nshall \u201cdeny to any person . . . the equal protection of the\nlaws.\u201d The Equal Protection Clause guarantees every\nperson the right to be treated equally by the State, with-\nout regard to race. \u201cAt the heart of this [guarantee] lies\nthe principle that the government must treat citizens as\nindividuals, and not as members of racial, ethnic, or reli-\ngious groups.\u201d Missouri v.

United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944).\nThere, we held that \u201c[p]ressing public necessity may some-\ntimes justify the existence of [racial discrimination]; racial\nantagonism never can.\u201d Id., at 216.1 Aside from Grutter,\nthe Court has recognized only two instances in which a\n\u201c[p]ressing public necessity\u201d may justify racial discrimina-\ntion by the government. First, in Korematsu, the Court\nrecognized that protecting national security may satisfy\nthis exacting standard. In that case, the Court upheld an\nevacuation order directed at \u201call persons of Japanese\nancestry\u201d on the grounds that the Nation was at war with\nJapan and that the order had \u201ca definite and close rela-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The standard of \u201cpressing public necessity\u201d is more frequently called\n\na \u201ccompelling governmental interest.\u201d I use the terms interchangeably.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ntionship to the prevention of espionage and sabotage.\u201d 323\nU. S., at 217\u2013218. Second, the Court has recognized that\nthe government has a compelling interest in remedying\npast discrimination for which it is responsible, but we\nhave stressed that a government wishing to use race must\nprovide \u201ca \u2018strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that\nremedial action [is] necessary.\u2019 \u201d Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S. 469, 500, 504 (1989) (quoting Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality\nopinion)).\n   In contrast to these compelling interests that may, in a\nnarrow set of circumstances, justify racial discrimination,\nthe Court has frequently found other asserted interests\ninsufficient. For example, in Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S.\n429 (1984), the Court flatly rejected a claim that the best\ninterests of a child justified the government\u2019s racial dis-\ncrimination. In that case, a state court awarded custody\nto a child\u2019s father because the mother was in a mixed-race\nmarriage. The state court believed the child might be\nstigmatized by living in a mixed-race household and\nsought to avoid this perceived problem in its custody\ndetermination. We acknowledged the possibility of stigma\nbut nevertheless concluded that \u201cthe reality of private\nbiases and the possible injury they might inflict\u201d do not\njustify racial discrimination. Id., at 433. As we explained,\n\u201cThe Constitution cannot control such prejudices but\nneither can it tolerate them. Private biases may be out-\nside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or\nindirectly, give them effect.\u201d Ibid.\n   Two years later, in Wygant, supra, the Court held that\neven asserted interests in remedying societal discrimina-\ntion and in providing role models for minority students\ncould not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimi-\nnation. In that case, a collective-bargaining agreement\nbetween a school board and a teacher\u2019s union favored\nteachers who were \u201c \u2018Black, American Indian, Oriental, or\n4        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nof Spanish descendancy.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 270\u2013271, and n. 2 (plu-\nrality opinion). We rejected the interest in remedying\nsocietal discrimination because it had no logical stopping\npoint. Id., at 276. We similarly rebuffed as inadequate\nthe interest in providing role models to minority students\nand added that the notion that \u201cblack students are better\noff with black teachers could lead to the very system the\nCourt rejected in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n483 (1954).\u201d Ibid.\n                              2\n   Grutter was a radical departure from our strict-scrutiny\nprecedents. In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law\nSchool (Law School) claimed that it had a compelling\nreason to discriminate based on race. The reason it ad-\nvanced did not concern protecting national security or\nremedying its own past discrimination. Instead, the Law\nSchool argued that it needed to discriminate in admissions\ndecisions in order to obtain the \u201ceducational benefits that\nflow from a diverse student body.\u201d 539 U. S., at 317.\nContrary to the very meaning of strict scrutiny, the Court\ndeferred to the Law School\u2019s determination that this inter-\nest was sufficiently compelling to justify racial discrimina-\ntion. Id., at 325.\n   I dissented from that part of the Court\u2019s decision. I\nexplained that \u201conly those measures the State must take\nto provide a bulwark against anarchy, or to prevent vio-\nlence, will constitute a \u2018pressing public necessity\u2019 \u201d suffi-\ncient to satisfy strict scrutiny. Id., at 353. Cf. Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U. S. 333, 334 (1968) (Black, J., concur-\nring) (protecting prisoners from violence might justify\nnarrowly tailored discrimination); J. A. Croson, supra, at\n521 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cAt least where\nstate or local action is at issue, only a social emergency\nrising to the level of imminent danger to life and limb . . .\ncan justify [racial discrimination]\u201d).

As should be obvious, there is nothing \u201cpressing\u201d or\n\u201cnecessary\u201d about obtaining whatever educational benefits\nmay flow from racial diversity.\n                              II\n\n                               A\n\n   The University claims that the District Court found that\nit has a compelling interest in attaining \u201ca diverse stu-\ndent body and the educational benefits flowing from such\ndiversity.\u201d Brief for Respondents 18. The use of the con-\njunction, \u201cand,\u201d implies that the University believes its\ndiscrimination furthers two distinct interests. The first is\nan interest in attaining diversity for its own sake. The sec-\nond is an interest in attaining educational benefits that\nallegedly flow from diversity.\n   Attaining diversity for its own sake is a nonstarter. As\neven Grutter recognized, the pursuit of diversity as an end\nis nothing more than impermissible \u201cracial balancing.\u201d\n539 U. S., at 329\u2013330 (\u201cThe Law School\u2019s interest is not\nsimply \u2018to assure within its student body some specified\npercentage of a particular group merely because of its race\nor ethnic origin.\u2019 That would amount to outright racial\nbalancing, which is patently unconstitutional\u201d (quoting\nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 307\n(1978); citation omitted)); see also id., at 307 (\u201cPreferring\nmembers of any one group for no reason other than race or\nethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the\nConstitution forbids\u201d). Rather, diversity can only be the\nmeans by which the University obtains educational benefits;\nit cannot be an end pursued for its own sake. Therefore,\nthe educational benefits allegedly produced by diversity\nmust rise to the level of a compelling state interest in order\nfor the program to survive strict scrutiny.\n   Unfortunately for the University, the educational bene-\nfits flowing from student body diversity\u2014assuming they\nexist\u2014hardly qualify as a compelling state interest. In-\n6        FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ndeed, the argument that educational benefits justify racial\ndiscrimination was advanced in support of racial segrega-\ntion in the 1950\u2019s, but emphatically rejected by this Court.\nAnd just as the alleged educational benefits of segregation\nwere insufficient to justify racial discrimination then, see\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the\nalleged educational benefits of diversity cannot justify\nracial discrimination today.\n                               1\n   Our desegregation cases establish that the Constitution\nprohibits public schools from discriminating based on race,\neven if discrimination is necessary to the schools\u2019 survival.\nIn Davis v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., decided with\nBrown, supra, the school board argued that if the Court\nfound segregation unconstitutional, white students would\nmigrate to private schools, funding for public schools\nwould decrease, and public schools would either decline in\nquality or cease to exist altogether.

We are up\nagainst the proposition: What does the Negro profit if he\nprocures an immediate detailed decree from this Court\nnow and then impairs or mars or destroys the public\nschool system in Prince Edward County\u201d).2\n   Unmoved by this sky-is-falling argument, we held that\nsegregation violates the principle of equality enshrined in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. See Brown, supra, at 495\n(\u201c[I]n the field of public education the doctrine of \u2018separate\nbut equal\u2019 has no place.

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmay not be denied enforcement of rights to which he is\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States be-\ncause of action taken or threatened in defiance of such\nrights\u201d). Within a matter of years, the warning became\nreality: After being ordered to desegregate, Prince Edward\nCounty closed its public schools from the summer of 1959\nuntil the fall of 1964. See R. Sarratt, The Ordeal of De-\nsegregation 237 (1966). Despite this fact, the Court never\nbacked down from its rigid enforcement of the Equal\nProtection Clause\u2019s antidiscrimination principle.\n   In this case, of course, Texas has not alleged that the\nUniversity will close if it is prohibited from discriminating\nbased on race. But even if it had, the foregoing cases\nmake clear that even that consequence would not justify\nits use of racial discrimination. It follows, a fortiori, that\nthe putative educational benefits of student body diversity\ncannot justify racial discrimination: If a State does not\nhave a compelling interest in the existence of a university,\nit certainly cannot have a compelling interest in the sup-\nposed benefits that might accrue to that university from\nracial discrimination. See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 361 (opin-\nion of THOMAS, J.) (\u201c[A] marginal improvement in legal\neducation cannot justify racial discrimination where the\nLaw School has no compelling interest either in its exis-\ntence or in its current educational and admissions poli-\ncies\u201d). If the Court were actually applying strict scrutiny,\nit would require Texas either to close the University or to\nstop discriminating against applicants based on their race.\nThe Court has put other schools to that choice, and there\nis no reason to treat the University differently.\n                            2\n  It is also noteworthy that, in our desegregation cases,\nwe rejected arguments that are virtually identical to those\nadvanced by the University today.

See, e.g., Brief for\nRespondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity \u201cpre-\npares students to become the next generation of leaders in\nan increasingly diverse society\u201d). The segregationists\nlikewise defended segregation on the ground that it pro-\nvided more leadership opportunities for blacks. See, e.g.,\nBrief for Respondents in Sweatt 96 (\u201c[A] very large group\nof Northern Negroes [comes] South to attend separate\ncolleges, suggesting that the Negro does not secure as\nwell-rounded a college life at a mixed college, and that the\nseparate college offers him positive advantages; that there\nis a more normal social life for the Negro in a separate\ncollege; that there is a greater opportunity for full partici-\npation and for the development of leadership; that the\nNegro is inwardly more \u2018secure\u2019 at a college of his own\npeople\u201d); Brief for Appellees in Davis 25\u201326 (\u201cThe Negro\nchild gets an opportunity to participate in segregated\nschools that I have never seen accorded to him in non-\nsegregated schools.

It is irrelevant under the\nFourteenth Amendment whether segregated or mixed\nschools produce better leaders. Indeed, no court today\nwould accept the suggestion that segregation is permissi-\nble because historically black colleges produced Booker T.\nWashington, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr.,\nand other prominent leaders. Likewise, the University\u2019s\nracial discrimination cannot be justified on the ground\nthat it will produce better leaders.\n   The University also asserts that student body diversity\nimproves interracial relations. See, e.g., Brief for Re-\nspondents 6 (arguing that student body diversity promotes\n\u201ccross-racial understanding\u201d and breaks down racial and\nethnic stereotypes). In this argument, too, the University\n10       FISHER v.

There is no principled distinction\nbetween the University\u2019s assertion that diversity yields\neducational benefits and the segregationists\u2019 assertion\nthat segregation yielded those same benefits. See Grutter,\n539 U. S., at 365\u2013366 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)

The Constitution does\nnot pander to faddish theories about whether race mixing\nis in the public interest.

This simple, yet funda-\nmental, truth was lost on the Court in Plessy and Grutter.\n  I would overrule Grutter and hold that the University\u2019s\nadmissions program violates the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause the University has not put forward a compelling\ninterest that could possibly justify racial discrimination.\n                              III\n   While I find the theory advanced by the University to\njustify racial discrimination facially inadequate, I also\nbelieve that its use of race has little to do with the alleged\neducational benefits of diversity. I suspect that the Uni-\nversity\u2019s program is instead based on the benighted notion\nthat it is possible to tell when discrimination helps, rather\nthan hurts, racial minorities.

See, e.g., Brief for Appellees in Briggs 33\u201334 (\u201c \u2018I\nhave repeatedly seen wise and loving colored parents take\ninfinite pains to force their little children into schools\nwhere the white children, white teachers, and white par-\nents despised and resented the dark child, made mock of\nit, neglected or bullied it, and literally rendered its life a\nliving hell.

And there was and there still is an\nintention by the Congress to see that these children shall\nbe educated in a healthful atmosphere, in a wholesome\natmosphere, in a place where they are wanted, in a place\nwhere they will not be looked upon with hostility, in a\nplace where there will be a receptive atmosphere for learn-\ning for both races without the hostility that undoubtedly\nCongress thought might creep into these situations\u201d). And\nthey even appealed to the fact that many blacks agreed\nthat separate schools were in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of both\nraces.

I think the lesson of history is clear enough:\nRacial discrimination is never benign. \u201c \u2018[B]enign\u2019 carries\nwith it no independent meaning, but reflects only ac-\nceptance of the current generation\u2019s conclusion that a\npolitically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citi-\nzens on the basis of race, is reasonable.\u201d See Metro Broad\u00ad\ncasting, 497 U.

S., at 505 (\u201cWe have insisted on\nstrict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called \u2018benign\u2019\nracial classifications\u201d); Adarand, 515 U.

The University\u2019s professed good intentions can-\nnot excuse its outright racial discrimination any more\nthan such intentions justified the now denounced argu-\nments of slaveholders and segregationists.\n                             B\n  While it does not, for constitutional purposes, matter\nwhether the University\u2019s racial discrimination is benign, I\nnote that racial engineering does in fact have insidious\nconsequences. There can be no doubt that the University\u2019s\ndiscrimination injures white and Asian applicants who are\ndenied admission because of their race. But I believe the\ninjury to those admitted under the University\u2019s discrimi-\nnatory admissions program is even more harmful.\n  Blacks and Hispanics admitted to the University as a\nresult of racial discrimination are, on average, far less\nprepared than their white and Asian classmates. In the\nUniversity\u2019s entering class of 2009, for example, among\nthe students admitted outside the Top Ten Percent plan,\nblacks scored at the 52d percentile of 2009 SAT takers\nnationwide, while Asians scored at the 93d percentile.\nBrief for Richard Sander et al. as Amici Curiae 3\u20134, and\nn. 4. Blacks had a mean GPA of 2.57 and a mean SAT\nscore of 1524; Hispanics had a mean GPA of 2.83 and a\nmean SAT score of 1794; whites had a mean GPA of 3.04\nand a mean SAT score of 1914; and Asians had a mean\nGPA of 3.07 and a mean SAT score of 1991.4 Ibid.\n  Tellingly, neither the University nor any of the 73 amici\nbriefs in support of racial discrimination has presented a\nshred of evidence that black and Hispanic students are\nable to close this substantial gap during their time at the\nUniversity. Cf. Thernstrom & Thernstrom, Reflections on\nthe Shape of the River, 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1583, 1605\u20131608\n(1999) (discussing the failure of defenders of racial dis-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The lowest possible score on the SAT is 600, and the highest possi-\n\nble score is 2400.\n18       FISHER v.

Cole & E. Barber, Increasing Faculty Diversity:\nThe Occupational Choices of High-Achieving Minority\nStudents 124 (2003). There is no reason to believe this is\nnot the case at the University. The University and its\ndozens of amici are deafeningly silent on this point.\n   Furthermore, the University\u2019s discrimination does\nnothing to increase the number of blacks and Hispanics\nwho have access to a college education generally. Instead,\nthe University\u2019s discrimination has a pervasive shifting\neffect. See T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the\nWorld 145\u2013146 (2004). The University admits minorities\nwho otherwise would have attended less selective colleges\nwhere they would have been more evenly matched. But,\nas a result of the mismatching, many blacks and Hispan-\nics who likely would have excelled at less elite schools are\nplaced in a position where underperformance is all but\ninevitable because they are less academically prepared\nthan the white and Asian students with whom they must\ncompete. Setting aside the damage wreaked upon the self-\nconfidence of these overmatched students, there is no\nevidence that they learn more at the University than they\nwould have learned at other schools for which they were\nbetter prepared. Indeed, they may learn less.\n   The Court of Appeals believed that the University needed\nto enroll more blacks and Hispanics because they remained\n\u201cclustered in certain programs.\u201d 631 F. 3d 213, 240\n(CA5 2011) (\u201c[N]early a quarter of the undergraduate\nstudents in [the University\u2019s] College of Social Work are\nHispanic, and more than 10% are [black].

In this case, for example, most blacks and Hispanics\nattending the University were admitted without discrimina-\ntion under the Top Ten Percent plan, but no one can\ndistinguish those students from the ones whose race\nplayed a role in their admission. \u201cWhen blacks [and His-\npanics] take positions in the highest places of government,\nindustry, or academia, it is an open question . . . whether\ntheir skin color played a part in their advancement.\u201d See\nGrutter, 539 U. S., at 373 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). \u201cThe\nquestion itself is the stigma\u2014because either racial dis-\ncrimination did play a role, in which case the person may\nbe deemed \u2018otherwise unqualified,\u2019 or it did not, in which\ncase asking the question itself unfairly marks those . . .\nwho would succeed without discrimination.\u201d Ibid. Al-\nthough cloaked in good intentions, the University\u2019s racial\ntinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping.\n                      *    *    *\n  For the foregoing reasons, I would overrule Grutter.\nHowever, because the Court correctly concludes that the\nCourt of Appeals did not apply strict scrutiny, I join its\nopinion.\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

S. 265, 316\u2013317 (1978). The University has\nsteered clear of a quota system like the one struck down in\nBakke, which excluded all nonminority candidates from\ncompetition for a fixed number of seats. See id., at 272\u2013\n275, 315, 319\u2013320 (opinion of Powell, J.). See also Gratz v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 293 (2003) (Souter, J., dissenting)\n(\u201cJustice Powell\u2019s opinion in [Bakke] rules out a racial\nquota or set-aside, in which race is the sole fact of eligibil-\nity for certain places in a class.\u201d). And, like so many edu-\ncational institutions across the Nation,1 the University\nhas taken care to follow the model approved by the Court\nin Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003).

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nF. Supp. 2d 587, 609 (WD Tex. 2009) (\u201c[T]he parties agree\n[that the University\u2019s] policy was based on the [admis-\nsions] policy [upheld in Grutter].\u201d).\n   Petitioner urges that Texas\u2019 Top Ten Percent Law and\nrace-blind holistic review of each application achieve\nsignificant diversity, so the University must be content\nwith those alternatives. I have said before and reiterate\nhere that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly\nneutral alternatives as race unconscious. See Gratz, 539\nU. S., at 303\u2013304, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). As Justice\nSouter observed, the vaunted alternatives suffer from \u201cthe\ndisadvantage of deliberate obfuscation.\u201d Id., at 297\u2013298\n(dissenting opinion).\n   Texas\u2019 percentage plan was adopted with racially segre-\ngated neighborhoods and schools front and center stage.\nSee House Research Organization, Bill Analysis, HB 588,\npp. 4\u20135 (Apr. 15, 1997) (\u201cMany regions of the state, school\ndistricts, and high schools in Texas are still predominantly\ncomposed of people from a single racial or ethnic group.\nBecause of the persistence of this segregation, admitting\nthe top 10 percent of all high schools would provide a\ndiverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified\npool of minority students was admitted to Texas universi-\nties.\u201d). It is race consciousness, not blindness to race, that\ndrives such plans.2 As for holistic review, if universities\ncannot explicitly include race as a factor, many may \u201cre-\nsort to camouflage\u201d to \u201cmaintain their minority enroll-\nment.\u201d Gratz, 539 U. S., at 304 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting).\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        notion that Texas\u2019 Top Ten Percent Law is race neutral calls to\nmind Professor Thomas Reed Powell\u2019s famous statement: \u201cIf you think\nthat you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something\nelse without thinking of the thing which it is attached to, then you have\na legal mind.\u201d T. Arnold, The Symbols of Government 101 (1935)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Only that kind of legal mind could\nconclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial\ndiversity is not race conscious.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   I have several times explained why government actors,\nincluding state universities, need not be blind to the lin-\ngering effects of \u201can overtly discriminatory past,\u201d the\nlegacy of \u201ccenturies of law-sanctioned inequality.\u201d Id., at\n298 (dissenting opinion). See also Adarand Constructors,\nInc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U. S. 200, 272\u2013274 (1995) (dissenting\nopinion). Among constitutionally permissible options, I\nremain convinced, \u201cthose that candidly disclose their\nconsideration of race [are] preferable to those that conceal\nit.\u201d Gratz, 539 U. S., at 305, n. 11 (dissenting opinion).\n   Accordingly, I would not return this case for a second\nlook. As the thorough opinions below show, 631 F. 3d 213\n(CA5 2011); </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1498468\"><a href=\"/txwd/8FrE/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the University\u2019s admis-\nsions policy flexibly considers race only as a \u201cfactor of a\nfactor of a factor of a factor\u201d in the calculus, id., at 608;\nfollowed a yearlong review through which the University\nreached the reasonable, good-faith judgment that suppos-\nedly race-neutral initiatives were insufficient to achieve,\nin appropriate measure, the educational benefits of student-\nbody diversity, see 631 F. 3d, at 225\u2013226; and is sub-\nject to periodic review to ensure that the consideration of\nrace remains necessary and proper to achieve the Uni-\nversity\u2019s educational objectives, see id., at 226.3 Justice\nPowell\u2019s opinion in Bakke and the Court\u2019s decision in\nGrutter require no further determinations. See Grutter,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 As the Court said in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 339 (2003),\n\n\u201c[n]arrow tailoring . . . require[s] serious, good faith consideration of\nworkable race-neutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the\nuniversity seeks.\u201d But, Grutter also explained, it does not \u201crequire a\nuniversity to choose between maintaining a reputation for excellence\n[and] fulfilling a commitment to provide educational opportunities\nto members of all racial groups.\u201d Ibid. I do not read the Court to\nsay otherwise. See ante, at 10 (acknowledging that, in determining\nwhether a race-conscious admissions policy satisfies Grutter\u2019s narrow-\ntailoring requirement, \u201ca court can take account of a university\u2019s\nexperience and expertise in adopting or rejecting certain admissions\nprocesses\u201d).\n4         FISHER v. UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n539 U. S., at 333\u2013343; Bakke, 438 U. S., at 315\u2013320.\n   The Court rightly declines to cast off the equal protec-\ntion framework settled in Grutter. See ante, at 5. Yet it\nstops short of reaching the conclusion that framework\nwarrants. Instead, the Court vacates the Court of Ap-\npeals\u2019 judgment and remands for the Court of Appeals to\n\u201cassess whether the University has offered sufficient\nevidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly\ntailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. As I see it, the Court of Appeals has already\ncompleted that inquiry, and its judgment, trained on this\nCourt\u2019s Bakke and Grutter pathmarkers, merits our\napprobation.4\n                      *     *    *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 Because the University\u2019s admissions policy, in my view, is constitu-\n\ntional under Grutter, there is no need for the Court in this case \u201cto\nrevisit whether all governmental classifications by race, whether\ndesigned to benefit or to burden a historically disadvantaged group,\nshould be subject to the same standard of judicial review.\u201d 539 U. S., at\n346, n. (GINSBURG, J., concurring). See also Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 244, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting) (\u201cActions designed to\nburden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly\nranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched\ndiscrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.\u201d).\n</pre>",
