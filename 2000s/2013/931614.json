HOLDER, ATTORNEY\n              GENERAL, ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n          THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n     No. 12\u201396. Argued February 27, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial\n  discrimination in voting, \u201can insidious and pervasive evil which had\n  been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting\n  and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.\u201d South Carolina v. Kat-\n  zenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309. Section 2 of the Act, which bans any\n  \u201cstandard, practice, or procedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or\n  abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of race\n  or color,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and\n  is not at issue in this case. Other sections apply only to some parts of\n  the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the \u201ccoverage formula,\u201d de-\n  fining the \u201ccovered jurisdictions\u201d as States or political subdivisions\n  that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had\n  low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n  \u00a71973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, \u00a75 of the Act provides that\n  no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by\n  specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. \u00a71973c(a). Such\n  approval is known as \u201cpreclearance.\u201d\n     The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially\n  set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized sev-\n  eral times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25\n  years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still\n  turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or\n  1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time. Short-\n  ly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to\n  bail out from the Act\u2019s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged\n  the Act\u2019s constitutionality. This Court resolved the challenge on\n  statutory grounds, but expressed serious doubts about the Act\u2019s con-\n2                    SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    tinued constitutionality. See Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\n    No. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193.\n      Petitioner Shelby County, in the covered jurisdiction of Alabama,\n    sued the Attorney General in Federal District Court in Washington,\n    D. C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are fa-\n    cially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against\n    their enforcement. The District Court upheld the Act, finding that\n    the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reau-\n    thorizing \u00a75 and continuing \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage formula. The D. C. Cir-\n    cuit affirmed. After surveying the evidence in the record, that court\n    accepted Congress\u2019s conclusion that \u00a72 litigation remained inade-\n    quate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority\n    voters, that \u00a75 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage\n    formula continued to pass constitutional muster.\nHeld: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula\n can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to pre-\n clearance. Pp. 9\u201325.\n    (a) In Northwest Austin, this Court noted that the Voting Rights\n Act \u201cimposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs\u201d\n and concluded that \u201ca departure from the fundamental principle of\n equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\u2019s disparate geo-\n graphic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d\n 557 U. S., at 203. These basic principles guide review of the question\n presented here. Pp. 9\u201317.\n      (1) State legislation may not contravene federal law. States re-\n tain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and\n pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment re-\n serves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal\n Government, including \u201cthe power to regulate elections.\u201d Gregory v.\n Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461\u2013462. There is also a \u201cfundamental prin-\n ciple of equal sovereignty\u201d among the States, which is highly perti-\n nent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin,\n supra, at 203.\n    The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.\n It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission\n to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact\n and execute on their own. And despite the tradition of equal sover-\n eignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).\n That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as \u201cstringent\u201d and\n \u201cpotent,\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. The Court nonethe-\n less upheld the Act, concluding that such an \u201cuncommon exercise of\n congressional power\u201d could be justified by \u201cexceptional conditions.\u201d\n Id., at 334. Pp. 9\u201312.\n      (2) In 1966, these departures were justified by the \u201cblight of ra-\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncial discrimination in voting\u201d that had \u201cinfected the electoral process\nin parts of our country for nearly a century,\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S.,\nat 308. At the time, the coverage formula\u2014the means of linking the\nexercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that war-\nranted it\u2014made sense. The Act was limited to areas where Congress\nfound \u201cevidence of actual voting discrimination,\u201d and the covered ju-\nrisdictions shared two characteristics: \u201cthe use of tests and devices\nfor voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential elec-\ntion at least 12 points below the national average.\u201d Id., at 330. The\nCourt explained that \u201c[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting dis-\ncrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating\nthe evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that\nwidespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of\nactual voters.\u201d Ibid. The Court therefore concluded that \u201cthe cover-\nage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\u201d Ibid.\nPp. 12\u201313.\n     (3) Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.\nLargely because of the Voting Rights Act, \u201c[v]oter turnout and regis-\ntration rates\u201d in covered jurisdictions \u201cnow approach parity. Blatant-\nly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\u201d Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have\nbeen forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not\neased \u00a75\u2019s restrictions or narrowed the scope of \u00a74\u2019s coverage formula\nalong the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented fea-\ntures have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they\nhave grown even stronger. Because \u00a75 applies only to those jurisdic-\ntions singled out by \u00a74, the Court turns to consider that provision.\nPp. 13\u201317.\n   (b) Section 4\u2019s formula is unconstitutional in light of current condi-\ntions. Pp. 17\u201325.\n     (1) In 1966, the coverage formula was \u201crational in both practice\nand theory.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 330. It looked to cause (discrimi-\nnatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tai-\nlored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.\nBy 2009, however, the \u201ccoverage formula raise[d] serious constitu-\ntional questions.\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. Coverage today\nis based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula\ncaptures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registra-\ntion and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have\nbeen banned for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in covered States have risen dramatically. In 1965, the\nStates could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests\nand low voter registration and turnout and those without those char-\n4                     SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    acteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.\n    Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Vot-\n    ing Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were. Pp. 17\u201318.\n         (2) The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds\n    that it is \u201creverse-engineered\u201d\u2014Congress identified the jurisdictions\n    to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them. Kat-\n    zenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that\n    the coverage formula was rational because the \u201cformula . . . was rele-\n    vant to the problem.\u201d 383 U. S., at 329, 330. The Government has a\n    fallback argument\u2014because the formula was relevant in 1965, its\n    continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in\n    the States identified in 1965. But this does not look to \u201ccurrent polit-\n    ical conditions,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a\n    comparison between the States in 1965. But history did not end in\n    1965. In assessing the \u201ccurrent need[ ]\u201d for a preclearance system\n    treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965\n    cannot be ignored. The Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to pun-\n    ish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve\n    that purpose, Congress\u2014if it is to divide the States\u2014must identify\n    those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in\n    light of current conditions. Pp. 18\u201321.\n         (3) Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record com-\n    piled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act. Regardless of how\n    one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything\n    approaching the \u201cpervasive,\u201d \u201cflagrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201crampant\u201d\n    discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions\n    from the rest of the Nation in 1965. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315,\n    331. But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use\n    that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current condi-\n    tions. It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts hav-\n    ing no logical relation to the present day. Pp. 21\u201322.\n679 F. 3d 848, reversed.\n\n  ROBERTS, C.

ERIC\n   H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary\nmeasures to address an extraordinary problem. Section 5\nof the Act required States to obtain federal permission\nbefore enacting any law related to voting\u2014a drastic depar-\nture from basic principles of federalism. And \u00a74 of the Act\napplied that requirement only to some States\u2014an equally\ndramatic departure from the principle that all States\nenjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but\nCongress determined it was needed to address entrenched\nracial discrimination in voting, \u201can insidious and perva-\nsive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance\nof the Constitution.\u201d South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). As we explained in upholding\nthe law, \u201cexceptional conditions can justify legislative\nmeasures not otherwise appropriate.\u201d Id., at 334. Reflect-\ning the unprecedented nature of these measures, they\nwere scheduled to expire after five years. See Voting\nRights Act of 1965, \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438.\n2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed,\nthey have been made more stringent, and are now sched-\nuled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that\nthe conditions that originally justified these measures no\nlonger characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By\n2009, \u201cthe racial gap in voter registration and turnout\n[was] lower in the States originally covered by \u00a75 than it\n[was] nationwide.\u201d Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\nNo. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 203\u2013204 (2009). Since\nthat time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-\nAmerican voter turnout has come to exceed white voter\nturnout in five of the six States originally covered by \u00a75,\nwith a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one\npercent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Re-\nported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and His-\npanic Origin, for States (Nov. 2012) (Table 4b).\n  At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no\none doubts that. The question is whether the Act\u2019s ex-\ntraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of\nthe States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.\nAs we put it a short time ago, \u201cthe Act imposes current\nburdens and must be justified by current needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the\nwake of the Civil War. It provides that \u201c[t]he right of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account\nof race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\u201d and it\ngives Congress the \u201cpower to enforce this article by appro-\npriate legislation.\u201d\n   \u201cThe first century of congressional enforcement of the\nAmendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.\u201d\nId., at 197.

Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 310.\nCongress passed statutes outlawing some of these practices\nand facilitating litigation against them, but litigation\nremained slow and expensive, and the States came up with\nnew ways to discriminate as soon as existing ones were\nstruck down. Voter registration of African-Americans\nbarely improved. Id., at 313\u2013314.\n    Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Con-\ngress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.\nSection 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any\n\u201cstandard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied\n. . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United\nStates to vote on account of race or color.\u201d 79 Stat. 437.\nThe current version forbids any \u201cstandard, practice, or\nprocedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the\nright of any citizen of the United States to vote on account\nof race or color.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). Both the Federal\nGovernment and individuals have sued to enforce \u00a72, see,\ne.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994), and\ninjunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block\nvoting laws from going into effect, see 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973j(d). Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide,\nand is not at issue in this case.\n    Other sections targeted only some parts of the country.\nAt the time of the Act\u2019s passage, these \u201ccovered\u201d jurisdic-\ntions were those States or political subdivisions that had\nmaintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as\nof November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter\nregistration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.\n\u00a74(b), 79 Stat. 438. Such tests or devices included literacy\nand knowledge tests, good moral character requirements,\nthe need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like.\n\u00a74(c), id., at 438\u2013439. A covered jurisdiction could \u201cbail\n4               SHELBY COUNTY v.

In 1965, the covered States\nincluded Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South\nCarolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivi-\nsions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in\nArizona. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2012).\n  In those jurisdictions, \u00a74 of the Act banned all such tests\nor devices. \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438.

A jurisdiction could obtain such \u201cpreclearance\u201d\nonly by proving that the change had neither \u201cthe purpose\n[nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on\naccount of race or color.\u201d Ibid.\n  Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they\nwere set to expire after five years. See \u00a74(a), id., at 438;\nNorthwest Austin, supra, at 199. In South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional\nchallenge, explaining that it was justified to address \u201cvot-\ning discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.\u201d\n383 U. S., at 308.\n  In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five\nyears, and extended the coverage formula in \u00a74(b) to juris-\ndictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent\nvoter registration or turnout as of 1968.

As a\nresult of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,\nand Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-\nida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-\nkota, became covered jurisdictions. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.\nCongress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to\nforbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in\na language minority group, in addition to discrimination\non the basis of race or color. \u00a7\u00a7203, 206, 89 Stat. 401, 402.\nFinally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and\ndevices permanent. \u00a7102, id., at 400.\n   In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but\ndid not alter its coverage formula. See Voting Rights Act\nAmendments, 96 Stat. 131. Congress did, however, amend\nthe bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of\ncovered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequi-\nsites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must\nnot have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive\npreclearance, or lost a \u00a72 suit, in the ten years prior to\nseeking bailout. \u00a72, id., at 131\u2013133.\n   We upheld each of these reauthorizations against con-\nstitutional challenge. See Georgia v. United States, 411\nU. S. 526 (1973); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S.\n156 (1980); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266\n(1999).\n   In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights\nAct for 25 years, again without change to its coverage\nformula.

Congress also amended \u00a75 to\nprohibit more conduct than before. \u00a75, id., at 580\u2013\n6                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n581; see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320,\n341 (2000) (Bossier II); Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461,\n479 (2003). Section 5 now forbids voting changes with\n\u201cany discriminatory purpose\u201d as well as voting changes\nthat diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race,\ncolor, or language minority status, \u201cto elect their preferred\ncandidates of choice.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71973c(b)\u2013(d).\n   Shortly after this reauthorization, a Texas utility district\nbrought suit, seeking to bail out from the Act\u2019s cover-\nage and, in the alternative, challenging the Act\u2019s constitu-\ntionality. See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 200\u2013201. A\nthree-judge District Court explained that only a State or\npolitical subdivision was eligible to seek bailout under the\nstatute, and concluded that the utility district was not a\npolitical subdivision, a term that encompassed only \u201ccoun-\nties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits.\u201d Northwest\nAustin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Mukasey, 573\nF. Supp. 2d 221, 232 (DC 2008). The District Court also\nrejected the constitutional challenge. Id., at 283.\n   We reversed. We explained that \u201c \u2018normally the Court\nwill not decide a constitutional question if there is some\nother ground upon which to dispose of the case.\u2019 \u201d North-\nwest Austin, supra, at 205 (quoting Escambia County v.\nMcMillan, 466 U. S. 48, 51 (1984) (per curiam)). Conclud-\ning that \u201cunderlying constitutional concerns,\u201d among other\nthings, \u201ccompel[led] a broader reading of the bailout provi-\nsion,\u201d we construed the statute to allow the utility district\nto seek bailout. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 207. In\ndoing so we expressed serious doubts about the Act\u2019s con-\ntinued constitutionality.\n   We explained that \u00a75 \u201cimposes substantial federalism\ncosts\u201d and \u201cdifferentiates between the States, despite our his-\ntoric tradition that all the States enjoy equal sovereignty.\u201d\nId., at 202, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe also noted that \u201c[t]hings have changed in the South.\nVoter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And minority candidates hold office at unprece-\ndented levels.\u201d Id., at 202. Finally, we questioned whether\nthe problems that \u00a75 meant to address were still \u201cconcen-\ntrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.\u201d\nId., at 203.\n   Eight Members of the Court subscribed to these views,\nand the remaining Member would have held the Act un-\nconstitutional. Ultimately, however, the Court\u2019s construc-\ntion of the bailout provision left the constitutional issues\nfor another day.\n                              B\n   Shelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdic-\ntion. It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General\nhas recently objected to voting changes proposed from\nwithin the county. See App. 87a\u201392a. Instead, in 2010,\nthe county sued the Attorney General in Federal District\nCourt in Washington, D. C., seeking a declaratory judg-\nment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are\nfacially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunc-\ntion against their enforcement. The District Court ruled\nagainst the county and upheld the Act. 811 F. Supp. 2d\n424, 508 (2011). The court found that the evidence before\nCongress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing \u00a75\nand continuing the \u00a74(b) coverage formula.\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit affirmed. In\nassessing \u00a75, the D. C. Circuit considered six primary\ncategories of evidence: Attorney General objections to\nvoting changes, Attorney General requests for more in-\nformation regarding voting changes, successful \u00a72 suits in\ncovered jurisdictions, the dispatching of federal observers\nto monitor elections in covered jurisdictions, \u00a75 preclear-\nance suits involving covered jurisdictions, and the deter-\nrent effect of \u00a75. See 679 F. 3d 848, 862\u2013863 (2012). After\nextensive analysis of the record, the court accepted Con-\n8                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019s conclusion that \u00a72 litigation remained inadequate\nin the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minori-\nty voters, and that \u00a75 was therefore still necessary. Id.,\nat 873.\n   Turning to \u00a74, the D. C. Circuit noted that the evidence\nfor singling out the covered jurisdictions was \u201cless robust\u201d\nand that the issue presented \u201ca close question.\u201d Id., at\n879. But the court looked to data comparing the number\nof successful \u00a72 suits in the different parts of the country.\nCoupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of \u00a75, the\ncourt concluded that the statute continued \u201cto single out\nthe jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,\u201d\nand thus held that the coverage formula passed constitu-\ntional muster. Id., at 883.\n   Judge Williams dissented. He found \u201cno positive cor-\nrelation between inclusion in \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage formula and\nlow black registration or turnout.\u201d Id., at 891. Rather,\nto the extent there was any correlation, it actually went\nthe other way: \u201ccondemnation under \u00a74(b) is a marker of\nhigher black registration and turnout.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Judge Williams also found that \u201c[c]overed juris-\ndictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion\nof the black population than do uncovered ones.\u201d Id., at\n892. As to the evidence of successful \u00a72 suits, Judge Wil-\nliams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions . . .\nhave worse records than eight of the covered jurisdic-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 897. He also noted that two covered juris-\ndictions\u2014Arizona and Alaska\u2014had not had any successful\nreported \u00a72 suit brought against them during the entire 24\nyears covered by the data. Ibid. Judge Williams would\nhave held the coverage formula of \u00a74(b) \u201cirrational\u201d and\nunconstitutional. Id., at 885.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U.

And we concluded that \u201ca departure\nfrom the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty re-\nquires a showing that a statute\u2019s disparate geographic\ncoverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it\ntargets.\u201d Ibid. These basic principles guide our review of\nthe question before us.1\n                               A\n   The Constitution and laws of the United States are \u201cthe\nsupreme Law of the Land.\u201d U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.\nState legislation may not contravene federal law. The\nFederal Government does not, however, have a general\nright to review and veto state enactments before they go\ninto effect. A proposal to grant such authority to \u201cnega-\ntive\u201d state laws was considered at the Constitutional\nConvention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to\ntake effect, subject to later challenge under the Supremacy\nClause. See 1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,\npp. 21, 164\u2013168 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); 2 id., at 27\u201329,\n390\u2013392.\n   Outside the strictures of the Supremacy Clause, States\nretain broad autonomy in structuring their governments\nand pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Constitu-\ntion provides that all powers not specifically granted to the\nFederal Government are reserved to the States or citizens.\nAmdt. 10. This \u201callocation of powers in our federal system\npreserves the integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty\nof the States.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564 U.

But the federal balance \u201cis not just\nan end in itself: Rather, federalism secures to citizens the\nliberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.\u201d\nIbid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   More specifically, \u201c \u2018the Framers of the Constitution\nintended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in\nthe Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.\u2019 \u201d\nGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461\u2013462 (1991) (quot-\ning Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 647 (1973); some\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Of course, the Federal\nGovernment retains significant control over federal elec-\ntions. For instance, the Constitution authorizes Congress\nto establish the time and manner for electing Senators and\nRepresentatives. Art. I, \u00a74, cl. 1; see also Arizona v. Inter\nTribal Council of Ariz., Inc., ante, at 4\u20136. But States have\n\u201cbroad powers to determine the conditions under which\nthe right of suffrage may be exercised.\u201d Carrington v.\nRash, 380 U.

S. ___, ___ (2012) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Not only do States retain sovereignty under the Consti-\ntution, there is also a \u201cfundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty\u201d among the States. Northwest Austin, supra,\nat 203 (citing United States v. Louisiana, 363 U. S. 1, 16\n(1960); Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 223 (1845);\nand Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725\u2013726 (1869); emphasis\nadded). Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained\nthat our Nation \u201cwas and is a union of States, equal in\npower, dignity and authority.\u201d Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S.\n559, 567 (1911). Indeed, \u201cthe constitutional equality of the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates is essential to the harmonious operation of the\nscheme upon which the Republic was organized.\u201d Id., at\n580. Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and\nKatzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated\nas a bar on differential treatment outside that context.\n383 U. S., at 328\u2013329. At the same time, as we made clear\nin Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subse-\nquent disparate treatment of States. 557 U. S., at 203.\n   The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic\nprinciples. It suspends \u201call changes to state election law\u2014\nhowever innocuous\u2014until they have been precleared\nby federal authorities in Washington, D. C.\u201d Id., at 202.\nStates must beseech the Federal Government for permis-\nsion to implement laws that they would otherwise have\nthe right to enact and execute on their own, subject of\ncourse to any injunction in a \u00a72 action. The Attorney\nGeneral has 60 days to object to a preclearance request,\nlonger if he requests more information. See 28 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a751.9, 51.37. If a State seeks preclearance from a three-\njudge court, the process can take years.\n   And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act\napplies to only nine States (and several additional coun-\nties). While one State waits months or years and expends\nfunds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor\ncan typically put the same law into effect immediately,\nthrough the normal legislative process. Even if a noncov-\nered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences\nbetween those proceedings and preclearance proceedings;\nthe preclearance proceeding \u201cnot only switches the burden\nof proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies\nsubstantive standards quite different from those govern-\ning the rest of the nation.\u201d 679 F. 3d, at 884 (Williams, J.,\ndissenting) (case below).\n   All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in\n1966, we described it as \u201cstringent\u201d and \u201cpotent.\u201d Katzen-\n12              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. We recognized that it\n\u201cmay have been an uncommon exercise of congressional\npower,\u201d but concluded that \u201clegislative measures not oth-\nerwise appropriate\u201d could be justified by \u201cexceptional con-\nditions.\u201d Id., at 334. We have since noted that the Act\n\u201cauthorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state\nand local policymaking,\u201d Lopez, 525 U. S., at 282, and\nrepresents an \u201cextraordinary departure from the tradi-\ntional course of relations between the States and the\nFederal Government,\u201d Presley v. Etowah County Comm\u2019n,\n502 U. S. 491, 500\u2013501 (1992). As we reiterated in\nNorthwest Austin, the Act constitutes \u201cextraordinary\nlegislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.\u201d\n557 U. S., at 211.\n                             B\n  In 1966, we found these departures from the basic fea-\ntures of our system of government justified. The \u201cblight of\nracial discrimination in voting\u201d had \u201cinfected the electoral\nprocess in parts of our country for nearly a century.\u201d\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Several States had enacted\na variety of requirements and tests \u201cspecifically designed\nto prevent\u201d African-Americans from voting. Id., at 310.\nCase-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent\nsuch racial discrimination in voting, in part because\nStates \u201cmerely switched to discriminatory devices not\ncovered by the federal decrees,\u201d \u201cenacted difficult new\ntests,\u201d or simply \u201cdefied and evaded court orders.\u201d Id., at\n314. Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,\nonly 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were\nregistered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisi-\nana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Id., at 313.\nThose figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more\nbelow the figures for whites. Ibid.\n  In short, we concluded that \u201c[u]nder the compulsion of\nthese unique circumstances, Congress responded in a\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npermissibly decisive manner.\u201d Id., at 334, 335. We also\nnoted then and have emphasized since that this extra-\nordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to\nexpire after five years. Id., at 333; Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 199.\n   At the time, the coverage formula\u2014the means of linking\nthe exercise of the unprecedented authority with the\nproblem that warranted it\u2014made sense. We found that\n\u201cCongress chose to limit its attention to the geographic\nareas where immediate action seemed necessary.\u201d Kat-\nzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328. The areas where Congress\nfound \u201cevidence of actual voting discrimination\u201d shared\ntwo characteristics: \u201cthe use of tests and devices for voter\nregistration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential\nelection at least 12 points below the national average.\u201d\nId., at 330. We explained that \u201c[t]ests and devices are\nrelevant to voting discrimination because of their long\nhistory as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate\nis pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disen-\nfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual\nvoters.\u201d Ibid. We therefore concluded that \u201cthe coverage\nformula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\u201d Ibid.\nIt accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely charac-\nterized by voting discrimination \u201con a pervasive scale,\u201d\nlinking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimi-\nnation and to the resulting disenfranchisement. Id., at\n308. The formula ensured that the \u201cstringent remedies\n[were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]\nbeen most flagrant.\u201d Id., at 315.\n                             C\n   Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-\ncally. Shelby County contends that the preclearance re-\nquirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,\nis now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal\nof force. In the covered jurisdictions, \u201c[v]oter turnout and\n14              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregistration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discrim-\ninatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\u201d Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 202. The tests and devices that\nblocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nation-\nwide for over 40 years. See \u00a76, 84 Stat. 315; \u00a7102, 89 Stat.\n400.\n   Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the\nsame when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that\n\u201c[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in-\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.\u201d\n\u00a72(b)(1), 120 Stat. 577. The House Report elaborated that\n\u201cthe number of African-Americans who are registered and\nwho turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly\nover the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,\u201d and noted\nthat \u201c[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote\nand cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white vot-\ners.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, p. 12 (2006). That Report\nalso explained that there have been \u201csignificant increases\nin the number of African-Americans serving in elected\noffices\u201d; more specifically, there has been approximately\na 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of\nAfrican-American elected officials in the six States origi-\nnally covered by the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 18.\n   The following chart, compiled from the Senate and\nHouse Reports, compares voter registration numbers from\n1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered\nStates.

Census Bureau data from the most recent election\nindicate that African-American voter turnout exceeded\nwhite voter turnout in five of the six States originally\ncovered by \u00a75, with a gap in the sixth State of less than\none half of one percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census\nBureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race\nand Hispanic Origin, for States (Table 4b). The preclear-\nance statistics are also illuminating. In the first decade\nafter enactment of \u00a75, the Attorney General objected to\n14.2 percent of proposed voting changes. H. R Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, at 22. In the last decade before reenactment, the\nAttorney General objected to a mere 0.16 percent. S. Rep.\nNo. 109\u2013295, at 13.\n  There is no doubt that these improvements are in large\npart because of the Voting Rights Act.

See Northwest\nAustin, supra, at 220, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Today both of\nthose towns are governed by African-American mayors.\nProblems remain in these States and others, but there is\nno denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation\nhas made great strides.\n   Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in \u00a75 or nar-\nrowed the scope of the coverage formula in \u00a74(b) along the\nway. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features\nwere reauthorized\u2014as if nothing had changed. In fact,\nthe Act\u2019s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.\nWhen Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for\nanother 25 years on top of the previous 40\u2014a far cry from\nthe initial five-year period. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a)(8).\nCongress also expanded the prohibitions in \u00a75. We had\npreviously interpreted \u00a75 to prohibit only those redistrict-\ning plans that would have the purpose or effect of worsen-\ning the position of minority groups. See Bossier II, 528\nU. S., at 324, 335\u2013336. In 2006, Congress amended \u00a75\nto prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but\ndid not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71973c(c), even though we had stated that such\nbroadening of \u00a75 coverage would \u201cexacerbate the substan-\ntial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure\nalready exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns\nabout \u00a75\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d Bossier II, supra, at 336\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addi-\ntion, Congress expanded \u00a75 to prohibit any voting law\n\u201cthat has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminish-\ning the ability of any citizens of the United States,\u201d on\naccount of race, color, or language minority status, \u201cto\nelect their preferred candidates of choice.\u201d \u00a71973c(b).

S., at 203; see Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\u201cconsiderations of race that\nwould doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth\nAmendment or \u00a72 [of the Voting Rights Act] seem to be\nwhat save it under \u00a75\u201d). Nothing has happened since to\nalleviate this troubling concern about the current applica-\ntion of \u00a75.\n   Respondents do not deny that there have been im-\nprovements on the ground, but argue that much of this\ncan be attributed to the deterrent effect of \u00a75, which dis-\nsuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimina-\ntion that they would resume should \u00a75 be struck down.\nUnder this theory, however, \u00a75 would be effectively im-\nmune from scrutiny; no matter how \u201cclean\u201d the record\nof covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be\nmade that it was deterrence that accounted for the good\nbehavior.\n   The provisions of \u00a75 apply only to those jurisdictions\nsingled out by \u00a74. We now consider whether that coverage\nformula is constitutional in light of current conditions.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage\nformula in 1966, we concluded that it was \u201crational in both\npractice and theory.\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 330. The\nformula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and ef-\nfect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the\nremedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting\nboth.\n  By 2009, however, we concluded that the \u201ccoverage\nformula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.\u201d North-\n18               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 204. As we explained, a stat-\nute\u2019s \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d must be justified by \u201ccurrent\nneeds,\u201d and any \u201cdisparate geographic coverage\u201d must be\n\u201csufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d Id., at\n203. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no\nlonger does so.\n  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradi-\ncated practices. The formula captures States by reference\nto literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in\nthe 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been\nbanned nationwide for over 40 years. \u00a76, 84 Stat. 315;\n\u00a7102, 89 Stat. 400. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in\nthe years since. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at 12. Racial\ndisparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justi-\nfying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula.\nSee, e.g., Katzenbach, supra, at 313, 329\u2013330. There is no\nlonger such a disparity.\n  In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:\nthose with a recent history of voting tests and low voter\nregistration and turnout, and those without those charac-\nteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that\ndistinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along\nthose lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it\nas if it were.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s defense of the formula is limited.\nFirst, the Government contends that the formula is \u201cre-\nverse-engineered\u201d: Congress identified the jurisdictions to\nbe covered and then came up with criteria to describe\nthem. Brief for Federal Respondent 48\u201349. Under that\nreasoning, there need not be any logical relationship be-\ntween the criteria in the formula and the reason for\ncoverage; all that is necessary is that the formula happen\nto capture the jurisdictions Congress wanted to single out.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that Katzenbach sanctioned\nsuch an approach, but the analysis in Katzenbach was\nquite different. Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage\nformula was rational because the \u201cformula . . . was rele-\nvant to the problem\u201d: \u201cTests and devices are relevant to\nvoting discrimination because of their long history as a\ntool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent\nfor the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchise-\nment must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.\u201d\n383 U. S., at 329, 330.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government\u2019s reverse-\nengineering argument does not even attempt to demon-\nstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem\nit targets. And in the context of a decision as significant\nas this one\u2014subjecting a disfavored subset of States\nto \u201cextraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our\nfederal system,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 211\u2014that\nfailure to establish even relevance is fatal.\n   The Government falls back to the argument that be-\ncause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use\nis permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the\nStates Congress identified back then\u2014regardless of how\nthat discrimination compares to discrimination in States\nunburdened by coverage. Brief for Federal Respondent\n49\u201350. This argument does not look to \u201ccurrent political\nconditions,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead\nrelies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That\ncomparison reflected the different histories of the North\nand South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by\nlaw until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim\nCrow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,\nand that state and local governments worked tirelessly to\ndisenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court\ninvoked that history\u2014rightly so\u2014in sustaining the dis-\nparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. See\nKatzenbach, supra, at 308 (\u201cThe constitutional propriety of\n20              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with refer-\nence to the historical experience which it reflects.\u201d).\n   But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act\nwas reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of\nit. In assessing the \u201ccurrent need[ ]\u201d for a preclearance\nsystem that treats States differently from one another\ntoday, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,\nlargely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were\nabolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout\ndue to race were erased, and African-Americans attained\npolitical office in record numbers. And yet the coverage\nformula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these\ndevelopments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-\nevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data\nreflecting current needs.\n   The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to\nvote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or\ncolor, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that\ncommand. The Amendment is not designed to punish for\nthe past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. See Rice\nv. Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 512 (2000) (\u201cConsistent with\nthe design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment\nis cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the\nparticular controversy which was the immediate impetus\nfor its enactment.\u201d). To serve that purpose, Congress\u2014if it\nis to divide the States\u2014must identify those jurisdictions to\nbe singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of\ncurrent conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We\nmade that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear\nagain today.\n                             C\n  In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the\nintervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from\nthe record that they claim justify disparate coverage.\nCongress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The court below and\nthe parties have debated what that record shows\u2014they\nhave gone back and forth about whether to compare cov-\nered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to dis-\naggregate the data State by State, how to weigh \u00a72 cases\nas evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to\nconsider evidence not before Congress, among other is-\nsues. Compare, e.g., 679 F. 3d, at 873\u2013883 (case below),\nwith id., at 889\u2013902 (Williams, J., dissenting). Regardless\nof how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say\nthat it shows anything approaching the \u201cpervasive,\u201d \u201cfla-\ngrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201crampant\u201d discrimination that\nfaced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the\ncovered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that\ntime. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 201.\n   But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did\nnot use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula\ngrounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a\nformula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical rela-\ntion to the present day. The dissent relies on \u201csecond-\ngeneration barriers,\u201d which are not impediments to the\ncasting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that\naffect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the\nproblem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as tar-\ngeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of\ncontinued reliance on the \u00a74 coverage formula, which is\nbased on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote\ndilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an\nupdated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute\nourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, see post, at 23, we are\nnot ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it\nplayed no role in shaping the statutory formula before us\ntoday.\n   The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in\n22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county\ncannot complain about the provisions that subject it to\npreclearance. Post, at 23\u201330. But that is like saying that\na driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all\nredheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out\nhis license has expired. Shelby County\u2019s claim is that the\ncoverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its appli-\ncations, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-\njected to preclearance. The county was selected based on\nthat formula, and may challenge it in court.\n                             D\n   The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise. It quotes\nthe famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, 4\nWheat. 316, 421 (1819), with the following emphasis: \u201cLet\nthe end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the\nconstitution, and all means which are appropriate, which\nare plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,\nbut consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,\nare constitutional.\u201d Post, at 9 (emphasis in dissent). But\nthis case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent\ndoes not emphasize\u2014the part that asks whether a legisla-\ntive means is \u201cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution.\u201d The dissent states that \u201c[i]t cannot tenably\nbe maintained\u201d that this is an issue with regard to the\nVoting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an\nopinion joined by two of today\u2019s dissenters, the Court\nexpressly stated that \u201c[t]he Act\u2019s preclearance require-\nment and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional\nquestions.\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. The dissent\ndoes not explain how those \u201cserious constitutional ques-\ntions\u201d became untenable in four short years.\n   The dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any\nother piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear\nfrom the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from\nordinary. At the risk of repetition, Katzenbach indicated\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthat the Act was \u201cuncommon\u201d and \u201cnot otherwise appro-\npriate,\u201d but was justified by \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d\nconditions. 383 U. S., at 334, 335. Multiple decisions\nsince have reaffirmed the Act\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d nature.\nSee, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211. Yet the dissent\ngoes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance\nrequirement and disparate treatment of the States should\nbe upheld into the future \u201cunless there [is] no or almost no\nevidence of unconstitutional action by States.\u201d Post, at 33.\n   In other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the ques-\ntion presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never\nhappened. For example, the dissent refuses to con-\nsider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest\nAustin\u2019s emphasis on its significance. Northwest Austin\nalso emphasized the \u201cdramatic\u201d progress since 1965, 557\nU. S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of\ndiscrimination as \u201cflagrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201cperva-\nsive,\u201d post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act\u2019s\n\u201cdisparate geographic coverage\u201d to be \u201csufficiently related\u201d\nto its targeted problems, 557 U. S., at 203, the dissent\nmaintains that an Act\u2019s limited coverage actually eases\nCongress\u2019s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous rela-\ntionship should suffice. Although Northwest Austin stated\ndefinitively that \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d must be justified by\n\u201ccurrent needs,\u201d ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage\nformula can be justified by history, and that the required\nshowing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law\nwas first passed.\n   There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-\nmula from review merely because it was previously enacted\n40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in\n2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present cover-\nage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to\ndistinguish between States in such a fundamental way\nbased on 40-year-old data, when today\u2019s statistics tell an\n24              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentirely different story. And it would have been irrational\nto base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,\nwhen such tests have been illegal since that time. But\nthat is exactly what Congress has done.\n                         *    *    *\n   Striking down an Act of Congress \u201cis the gravest and\nmost delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.\u201d\nBlodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.,\nconcurring). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,\nwe took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of\nthe Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead\nresolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But\nin issuing that decision, we expressed our broader con-\ncerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress\ncould have updated the coverage formula at that time, but\ndid not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no\nchoice but to declare \u00a74(b) unconstitutional. The formula\nin that section can no longer be used as a basis for subject-\ning jurisdictions to preclearance.\n   Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nation-\nwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in \u00a72.\nWe issue no holding on \u00a75 itself, only on the coverage\nformula. Congress may draft another formula based on\ncurrent conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequi-\nsite to a determination that exceptional conditions still\nexist justifying such an \u201cextraordinary departure from the\ntraditional course of relations between the States and the\nFederal Government.\u201d Presley, 502 U. S., at 500\u2013501. Our\ncountry has changed, and while any racial discrimination\nin voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the\nlegislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to\ncurrent conditions.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

While the pre-2006 version of\nthe Act went well beyond protection guaranteed under the\nConstitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520\nU. S. 471, 480\u2013482 (1997), it now goes even further.\n   It is, thus, quite fitting that the Court repeatedly points\nout that this legislation is \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d and recognizes the significant constitutional\nproblems created by Congress\u2019 decision to raise \u201cthe bar\nthat covered jurisdictions must clear,\u201d even as \u201cthe condi-\ntions justifying that requirement have dramatically im-\nproved.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317. However one aggregates the\ndata compiled by Congress, it cannot justify the consider-\nable burdens created by \u00a75.

ERIC\n   H. HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                           [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER,\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.\n   In the Court\u2019s view, the very success of \u00a75 of the Voting\nRights Act demands its dormancy. Congress was of\nanother mind. Recognizing that large progress has been\nmade, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec\u00ad\nord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir\u00ad\npated. The question this case presents is who decides\nwhether, as currently operative, \u00a75 remains justifiable,1\nthis Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to\nenforce the post-Civil War Amendments \u201cby appropriate\nlegislation.\u201d With overwhelming support in both Houses,\nCongress concluded that, for two prime reasons, \u00a75 should\ncontinue in force, unabated. First, continuance would\nfacilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far\nmade; and second, continuance would guard against back\u00ad\nsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress\u2019\nprovince to make and should elicit this Court\u2019s unstinting\napprobation.\n                             I\n  \u201c[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court purports to declare unconstitutional only the coverage\n\nformula set out in \u00a74(b). See ante, at 24. But without that formula, \u00a75\nis immobilized.\n2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 2. But the Court today terminates the remedy\nthat proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com\u00ad\nbat voting discrimination where other remedies had been\ntried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA\u2019s re\u00ad\nquirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting\nlaws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated\nrecords of rank discrimination against minority voting\nrights.\n   A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend\u00ad\nments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis\u00ad\ncrimination on the basis of race, the \u201cblight of racial\ndiscrimination in voting\u201d continued to \u201cinfec[t] the\nelectoral process in parts of our country.\u201d South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). Early attempts to\ncope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.\nWhenever one form of voting discrimination was identified\nand prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court\nrepeatedly encountered the remarkable \u201cvariety and\npersistence\u201d of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.\nId., at 311. To take just one example, the Court, in 1927,\nheld unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters\nfrom participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon,\n273 U. S. 536, 541; in 1944, the Court struck down a\n\u201creenacted\u201d and slightly altered version of the same law,\nSmith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 658; and in 1953, the\nCourt once again confronted an attempt by Texas to \u201ccir\u00ad\ncumven[t]\u201d the Fifteenth Amendment by adopting yet\nanother variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams,\n345 U. S. 461, 469.\n   During this era, the Court recognized that discrimina\u00ad\ntion against minority voters was a quintessentially politi\u00ad\ncal problem requiring a political solution. As Justice\nHolmes explained: If \u201cthe great mass of the white popula\u00ad\ntion intends to keep the blacks from voting,\u201d \u201crelief from\n[that] great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Harris, 189\nU. S. 475, 488 (1903).\n   Congress learned from experience that laws targeting\nparticular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case\nlitigation were inadequate to the task. In the Civil Rights\nActs of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and\nthen expanded the power of \u201cthe Attorney General to seek\ninjunctions against public and private interference with\nthe right to vote on racial grounds.\u201d Katzenbach, 383\nU. S., at 313. But circumstances reduced the ameliorative\npotential of these legislative Acts:\n    \u201cVoting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, some\u00ad\n    times requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent\n    combing through registration records in preparation\n    for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part\n    because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded\n    voting officials and others involved in the proceed\u00ad\n    ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been\n    obtained, some of the States affected have merely\n    switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the\n    federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests de\u00ad\n    signed to prolong the existing disparity between white\n    and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local of\u00ad\n    ficials have defied and evaded court orders or have\n    simply closed their registration offices to freeze the\n    voting rolls.\u201d Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).\nPatently, a new approach was needed.\n   Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one\nof the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified\nexercises of federal legislative power in our Nation\u2019s his\u00ad\ntory. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting\nlaws in the covered jurisdictions\u2014those States and locali\u00ad\nties where opposition to the Constitution\u2019s commands were\n4                SHELBY COUNTY v.

Under the preclearance\nregime established by \u00a75 of the VRA, covered jurisdictions\nmust submit proposed changes in voting laws or proce\u00ad\ndures to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has 60\ndays to respond to the changes. 79 Stat. 439, codified at\n42 U.

In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek\napproval by a three-judge District Court in the District of\nColumbia.\n   After a century\u2019s failure to fulfill the promise of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the\nVRA finally led to signal improvement on this front. \u201cThe\nJustice Department estimated that in the five years after\n[the VRA\u2019s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to\nvote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North\nCarolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century\nbefore 1965.\u201d Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief\nHistory, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B.\nGrofman & C. Davidson eds. 1992). And in assessing the\noverall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that\n\u201c[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in\u00ad\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices. This\nprogress is the direct result of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965.\u201d Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott\nKing Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments\nAct of 2006 (hereinafter 2006 Reauthorization), \u00a72(b)(1),\n120 Stat. 577. On that matter of cause and effects there\ncan be no genuine doubt.\n   Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the\nrealization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date,\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 181\n(1980). Congress also found that as \u201cregistration and\nvoting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures\nmay be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority\nvoting strength.\u201d Ibid. (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94\u2013196,\np. 10 (1975)). See also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630,\n640 (1993) (\u201c[I]t soon became apparent that guaranteeing\nequal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other\nracially discriminatory voting practices\u201d such as voting\ndilution). Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes,\nin contrast to direct attempts to block access to the bal\u00ad\nlot, are aptly described as \u201csecond-generation barriers\u201d to\nminority voting.\n   Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One\nof the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing\nof legislative districts in an \u201ceffort to segregate the races\nfor purposes of voting.\u201d Id., at 642. Another is adoption of\na system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district\nvoting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switch\u00ad\ning to at-large voting, the overall majority could control\nthe election of each city council member, effectively elimi\u00ad\nnating the potency of the minority\u2019s votes.

Whatever\nthe device employed, this Court has long recognized that\nvote dilution, when adopted with a discriminatory pur\u00ad\npose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of\naccess to the ballot.

Ante, at 4\u20135.\nEach time, this Court upheld the reauthorization as a\nvalid exercise of congressional power. Ante, at 5. As the\n1982 reauthorization approached its 2007 expiration date,\nCongress again considered whether the VRA\u2019s preclear\u00ad\nance mechanism remained an appropriate response to the\nproblem of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions.\n   Congress did not take this task lightly. Quite the oppo\u00ad\nsite. The 109th Congress that took responsibility for the\nrenewal started early and conscientiously.

The Fifteenth Amend\u00ad\nment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimina\u00ad\ntion in voting rights, states that, in this domain, \u201cCongress\nshall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\nlegislation.\u201d2 In choosing this language, the Amendment\u2019s\nframers invoked Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s formulation of\nthe scope of Congress\u2019 powers under the Necessary and\nProper Clause:\n     \u201cLet the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of\n     the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,\n     which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not\n     prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the\n     constitution, are constitutional.\u201d McCulloch v. Mary-\n     land, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819) (emphasis added).\n  It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of\nCongress adopted to shield the right to vote from racial\ndiscrimination, is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Consti\u00ad\ntution read in light of the Civil War Amendments.

Each of these Amendments contains the\nsame broad empowerment of Congress to enact \u201cappropriate legisla\u00ad\ntion\u201d to enforce the protected right.

Today\u2019s Court does not\npurport to alter settled precedent establishing that the\ndispositive question is whether Congress has employed\n\u201crational means.\u201d\n   For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing\nstatute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require\u00ad\nments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization\nis at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative\nrecord justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en\u00ad\ntitled to consider that preexisting record as well as the\nrecord before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.\nThis is especially true where, as here, the Court has re\u00ad\npeatedly affirmed the statute\u2019s constitutionality and Con\u00ad\ngress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.\nSee id., at 174 (\u201cThe appellants are asking us to do noth\u00ad\ning less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach . . . , in which we upheld the constitutionality\nof the Act.\u201d); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266, 283\n(1999) (similar).\n   Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary\narises because Congress has built a temporal limitation\ninto the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of\nyears (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary\nevidence, the continued need for the VRA. Cf. Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343 (2003) (anticipating, but not\nguaranteeing, that, in 25 years, \u201cthe use of racial prefer\u00ad\nences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary\u201d).\n   Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup\u00ad\nporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record\noriginally made. Demand for a record of violations equiva\u00ad\nlent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a\n12               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncatch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less\nevidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that\nCongress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In\ncontrast, if the statute was not working, there would be\nplenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to\nrenew a failed regulatory regime. See Persily 193\u2013194.\n  This is not to suggest that congressional power in this\narea is limitless. It is this Court\u2019s responsibility to ensure\nthat Congress has used appropriate means. The question\nmeet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are\n\u201cadapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in\nview.\u201d Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). The\nCourt\u2019s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that\nof Congress, but to determine whether the legislative\nrecord sufficed to show that \u201cCongress could rationally\nhave determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro\u00ad\npriate methods.\u201d City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 176\u2013177.\n  In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in\nCongress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to\ncombat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed Congress\u2019 prerogative to use any\nrational means in exercise of its power in this area. And\nboth precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means\ntest should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the\nstatute\u2019s challenger should be higher, when what is at\nissue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has\npreviously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con\u00ad\ntemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s legitimate objective.\n                               III\n  The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully\nsatisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n421: Congress may choose any means \u201cappropriate\u201d and\n\u201cplainly adapted to\u201d a legitimate constitutional end. As we\nshall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The surest\nway to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is\nto see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim\u00ad\ninatory changes to voting laws. See City of Rome, 446\nU. S., at 181 (identifying \u201cinformation on the number and\ntypes of submissions made by covered jurisdictions and\nthe number and nature of objections interposed by the\nAttorney General\u201d as a primary basis for upholding the\n1975 reauthorization). On that score, the record before\nCongress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were\nmore DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than\nthere were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization\n(490). 1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need,\nHearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of\nthe House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued\nNeed).\n   All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked\nover 700 voting changes based on a determination that the\nchanges were discriminatory. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at\n21. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections\nincluded findings of discriminatory intent, see 679 F. 3d,\nat 867, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were\n\u201ccalculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully\nparticipating in the political process.\u201d H.

There was what one commentator\ndescribed as an \u201cavalanche of case studies of voting rights\nviolations in the covered jurisdictions,\u201d ranging from\n\u201coutright intimidation and violence against minority\nvoters\u201d to \u201cmore subtle forms of voting rights depriva\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Persily 202 (footnote omitted). This evidence gave\nCongress ever more reason to conclude that the time had\nnot yet come for relaxed vigilance against the scourge of\nrace discrimination in voting.\n   True, conditions in the South have impressively im\u00ad\nproved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress\nnoted this improvement and found that the VRA was the\ndriving force behind it. 2006 Reauthorization \u00a72(b)(1).\nBut Congress also found that voting discrimination had\nevolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that\neliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that\nhad been made. \u00a7\u00a72(b)(2), (9). Concerns of this order, the\nCourt previously found, gave Congress adequate cause to\nreauthorize the VRA. City of Rome, 446 U.

The evidence just\ndescribed, of preclearance\u2019s continuing efficacy in blocking\nconstitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself\ngrounded Congress\u2019 conclusion that the remedy should be\nretained for those jurisdictions.\n  There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris\u00ad\ndictions have a unique history of problems with racial\ndiscrimination in voting. Ante, at 12\u201313. Consideration of\nthis long history, still in living memory, was altogether\nappropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to\nrecognize that \u201chistory did not end in 1965.\u201d Ante, at 20.\nBut the Court ignores that \u201cwhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d W.\nShakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And \u201c[t]hose who\ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d 1\nG. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress\nwas especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains\nalready made and to prevent backsliding. 2006 Reauthor\u00ad\nization \u00a72(b)(9).\n  Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou\u00ad\nsands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,\nconditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that\nthe formula was still justified by \u201ccurrent needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U.

To Examine the Impact and Effectiveness\nof the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the Subcommit\u00ad\ntee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\n20                  SHELBY COUNTY v.

Because the pri\u00ad\nvate right of action authorized by \u00a72 of the VRA applies\nnationwide, a comparison of \u00a72 lawsuits in covered and\nnoncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick\nfor measuring differences between covered and noncovered\njurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimi\u00ad\nnation between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had\ndisappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful\n\u00a72 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas.6 The\nstudy\u2019s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimi\u00ad\nnation in voting remains \u201cconcentrated in the jurisdictions\nsingled out for preclearance.\u201d Northwest Austin, 557 U. S.,\nat 203.\n  Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25\npercent of the country\u2019s population, the Katz study re\u00ad\nvealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful\n\u00a72 litigation since 1982. Impact and Effectiveness 974.\nControlling for population, there were nearly four times as\nmany successful \u00a72 cases in covered jurisdictions as there\nwere in noncovered jurisdictions. 679 F. 3d, at 874.

From these findings\u2014ignored by the Court\u2014\nCongress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula\ncontinues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.\n  The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated\nthat voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially\npolarized than elsewhere in the country.

The reason is twofold.\nFirst, racial polarization means that racial minorities are\nat risk of being systematically outvoted and having their\ninterests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, \u201cwhen\npolitical preferences fall along racial lines, the natural\ninclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench\nthemselves have predictable racial effects. Under circum\u00ad\nstances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain politi\u00ad\ncal advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.\u201d\nAnsolabehere, Persily, & Stewart, Regional Differences\nin Racial Polarization in the 2012 Presidential Election:\nImplications for the Constitutionality of Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act, 126 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 205, 209\n(2013).\n  In other words, a governing political coalition has an\nincentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of\nvoting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by\nthe ruling party to pursue that incentive \u201cwill inevitably\ndiscriminate against a racial group.\u201d Ibid. Just as build\u00ad\nings in California have a greater need to be earthquake\u00ad\nproofed, places where there is greater racial polarization\nin voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to\nprevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was\nunderstood by Congress and is well recognized in the\nacademic literature. See 2006 Reauthorization \u00a72(b)(3),\n120 Stat. 577 (\u201cThe continued evidence of racially polar\u00ad\nized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the\n[preclearance requirement] demonstrates that racial and\nlanguage minorities remain politically vulnerable\u201d); H.

Congress, however, responded to\nthis concern. Critical components of the congressional\ndesign are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions\nto \u201cbail out\u201d of preclearance, and for court-ordered \u201cbail\nins.\u201d See Northwest Austin, 557 U.

The VRA\npermits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has\ncomplied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of vot\u00ad\ners. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). It also\nauthorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to\nfederal preclearance upon finding that violations of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred\nthere. \u00a71973a(c) (2006 ed.).\n   Congress was satisfied that the VRA\u2019s bailout mecha\u00ad\nnism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA\u2019s\ncoverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at 25 (the\nsuccess of bailout \u201cillustrates that: (1) covered status is\nneither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status\nhas been and continues to be within the control of the\njurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu\u00ad\ninely clean record and want to terminate coverage have\nthe ability to do so\u201d). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc\u00ad\ncessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and\nDOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an\neligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure\nbecame effective in 1984. Brief for Federal Respondent 54.\nThe bail-in mechanism has also worked. Several jurisdic\u00ad\ntions have been subject to federal preclearance by court\norders, including the States of New Mexico and Arkansas.\nApp. to Brief for Federal Respondent 1a\u20133a.\n   This experience exposes the inaccuracy of the Court\u2019s\nportrayal of the Act as static, unchanged since 1965.\nCongress designed the VRA to be a dynamic statute, capa\u00ad\nble of adjusting to changing conditions. True, many cov\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The same cannot be\nsaid of the Court\u2019s opinion today. The Court makes no\ngenuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative\nrecord that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on\nincreases in voter registration and turnout as if that were\nthe whole story. See supra, at 18\u201319. Without even\nidentifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively\nbrushes off arguments based on \u201cdata from the record,\u201d and\ndeclines to enter the \u201cdebat[e about] what [the] record\nshows.\u201d Ante, at 20\u201321. One would expect more from an\nopinion striking at the heart of the Nation\u2019s signal piece of\ncivil-rights legislation.\n  I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,\ngiven its usual restraint, does the Court even address\nShelby County\u2019s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the\nCourt veers away from controlling precedent regarding the\n\u201cequal sovereignty\u201d doctrine without even acknowledging\nthat it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect\nordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil\nWar Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not\neven deign to grapple with the legislative record.\n                             A\n  Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the\nVRA\u2019s 2006 reauthorization. \u201cA facial challenge to a\nlegislative Act,\u201d the Court has other times said, \u201cis, of\ncourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,\nsince the challenger must establish that no set of circum\u00ad\n24              SHELBY COUNTY v.

S. 739, 745 (1987).\n   \u201c[U]nder our constitutional system[,] courts are not\nroving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the\nvalidity of the Nation\u2019s laws.\u201d Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413\nU. S. 601, 610\u2013611 (1973). Instead, the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d is\nlimited to deciding particular \u201cCases\u201d and \u201cControversies.\u201d\nU. S. Const., Art. III, \u00a72. \u201cEmbedded in the traditional\nrules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle\nthat a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be\napplied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the\nground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitution\u00ad\nally to others, in other situations not before the Court.\u201d\nBroadrick, 413 U. S., at 610. Yet the Court\u2019s opinion in\nthis case contains not a word explaining why Congress\nlacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular\nplaintiff that initiated this lawsuit\u2014Shelby County, Ala\u00ad\nbama. The reason for the Court\u2019s silence is apparent, for\nas applied to Shelby County, the VRA\u2019s preclearance\nrequirement is hardly contestable.\n   Alabama is home to Selma, site of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d\nbeatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the\ncatalyst for the VRA\u2019s enactment. Following those events,\nMartin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont\u00ad\ngomery, Alabama\u2019s capital, where he called for passage of\nthe VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be\nmade even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast\nnational commitment to see the task through to comple\u00ad\ntion. In King\u2019s words, \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is\nlong, but it bends toward justice.\u201d G. May, Bending To\u00ad\nward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transfor\u00ad\nmation of American Democracy 144 (2013).\n   History has proved King right. Although circumstances\nin Alabama have changed, serious concerns remain.\nBetween 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest\nrates of successful \u00a72 suits, second only to its VRA-covered\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

In other words, even while subject to the\nrestraining effect of \u00a75, Alabama was found to have\n\u201cdeni[ed] or abridge[d]\u201d voting rights \u201con account of race or\ncolor\u201d more frequently than nearly all other States in the\nUnion. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). This fact prompted the\ndissenting judge below to concede that \u201ca more narrowly\ntailored coverage formula\u201d capturing Alabama and a\nhandful of other jurisdictions with an established track\nrecord of racial discrimination in voting \u201cmight be defensi\u00ad\nble.\u201d 679 F. 3d, at 897 (opinion of Williams, J.). That is an\nunderstatement. Alabama\u2019s sorry history of \u00a72 violations\nalone provides sufficient justification for Congress\u2019 deter\u00ad\nmination in 2006 that the State should remain subject to\n\u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement.7\n  A few examples suffice to demonstrate that, at least in\nAlabama, the \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d imposed by \u00a75\u2019s preclear\u00ad\nance requirement are \u201cjustified by current needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203. In the interim between the\nVRA\u2019s 1982 and 2006 reauthorizations, this Court twice\nconfronted purposeful racial discrimination in Alabama.\nIn Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),\nthe Court held that Pleasant Grove\u2014a city in Jefferson\nCounty, Shelby County\u2019s neighbor\u2014engaged in purposeful\ndiscrimination by annexing all-white areas while rejecting\nthe annexation request of an adjacent black neighborhood.\nThe city had \u201cshown unambiguous opposition to racial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 This lawsuit was filed by Shelby County, a political subdivision of\n\nAlabama, rather than by the State itself. Nevertheless, it is appropri\u00ad\nate to judge Shelby County\u2019s constitutional challenge in light of in\u00ad\nstances of discrimination statewide because Shelby County is subject to\n\u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement by virtue of Alabama\u2019s designation as a\ncovered jurisdiction under \u00a74(b) of the VRA. See ante, at 7. In any\nevent, Shelby County\u2019s recent record of employing an at-large electoral\nsystem tainted by intentional racial discrimination is by itself sufficient\nto justify subjecting the county to \u00a75\u2019s preclearance mandate. See infra,\nat 26.\n26              SHELBY COUNTY v.

Id., at 223 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The provision violated the Fourteenth Amend\u00ad\nment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, the Court unanimously\nconcluded, because \u201cits original enactment was motivated\nby a desire to discriminate against blacks on account of\nrace[,] and the [provision] continues to this day to have\nthat effect.\u201d Id., at 233.\n  Pleasant Grove and Hunter were not anomalies. In\n1986, a Federal District Judge concluded that the at-large\nelection systems in several Alabama counties violated \u00a72.\nDillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1354\u20131363\n(MD Ala. 1986). Summarizing its findings, the court\nstated that \u201c[f ]rom the late 1800\u2019s through the present,\n[Alabama] has consistently erected barriers to keep black\npersons from full and equal participation in the social,\neconomic, and political life of the state.\u201d Id., at 1360.\n  The Dillard litigation ultimately expanded to include\n183 cities, counties, and school boards employing discrim\u00ad\ninatory at-large election systems. Dillard v. Baldwin Cty.\nBd. of Ed., 686 F. Supp. 1459, 1461 (MD Ala. 1988). One\nof those defendants was Shelby County, which eventually\nsigned a consent decree to resolve the claims against it.\nSee Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty., 748 F. Supp. 819 (MD Ala.\n1990).\n  Although the Dillard litigation resulted in overhauls of\nnumerous electoral systems tainted by racial discrimina\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

In 2008, for\nexample, the city of Calera, located in Shelby County,\nrequested preclearance of a redistricting plan that \u201cwould\nhave eliminated the city\u2019s sole majority-black district,\nwhich had been created pursuant to the consent decree in\nDillard.\u201d 811 F. Supp. 2d 424, 443 (DC 2011). Although\nDOJ objected to the plan, Calera forged ahead with elec\u00ad\ntions based on the unprecleared voting changes, resulting\nin the defeat of the incumbent African-American council\u00ad\nman who represented the former majority-black district.\nIbid. The city\u2019s defiance required DOJ to bring a \u00a75 en\u00ad\nforcement action that ultimately yielded appropriate\nredress, including restoration of the majority-black dis\u00ad\ntrict. Ibid.; Brief for Respondent-Intervenors Earl Cun\u00ad\nningham et al. 20.\n    A recent FBI investigation provides a further window\ninto the persistence of racial discrimination in state poli\u00ad\ntics. See United States v. McGregor, 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339,\n1344\u20131348 (MD Ala. 2011). Recording devices worn by\nstate legislators cooperating with the FBI\u2019s investigation\ncaptured conversations between members of the state\nlegislature and their political allies. The recorded conver\u00ad\nsations are shocking. Members of the state Senate deri\u00ad\nsively refer to African-Americans as \u201cAborigines\u201d and talk\nopenly of their aim to quash a particular gambling-related\nreferendum because the referendum, if placed on the\nballot, might increase African-American voter turnout.\nId., at 1345\u20131346 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso id., at 1345 (legislators and their allies expressed\nconcern that if the referendum were placed on the ballot,\n\u201c \u2018[e]very black, every illiterate\u2019 would be \u2018bused [to the\npolls] on HUD financed buses\u2019 \u201d). These conversations oc\u00ad\ncurred not in the 1870\u2019s, or even in the 1960\u2019s, they took\nplace in 2010. Id., at 1344\u20131345. The District Judge\npresiding over the criminal trial at which the recorded\nconversations were introduced commented that the \u201cre\u00ad\n28                 SHELBY COUNTY v.

Id., at 1347. Racist sentiments, the\njudge observed, \u201cremain regrettably entrenched in the\nhigh echelons of state government.\u201d Ibid.\n  These recent episodes forcefully demonstrate that \u00a75\u2019s\npreclearance requirement is constitutional as applied to\nAlabama and its political subdivisions.8 And under our\ncase law, that conclusion should suffice to resolve this\ncase. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 24\u201325\n(1960) (\u201c[I]f the complaint here called for an application of\nthe statute clearly constitutional under the Fifteenth\nAmendment, that should have been an end to the question\nof constitutionality.\u201d). See also Nevada Dept. of Human\nResources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 743 (2003) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (where, as here, a state or local government\nraises a facial challenge to a federal statute on the ground\nthat it exceeds Congress\u2019 enforcement powers under the\nCivil War Amendments, the challenge fails if the opposing\nparty is able to show that the statute \u201ccould constitution\u00ad\nally be applied to some jurisdictions\u201d).\n  This Court has consistently rejected constitutional\nchallenges to legislation enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019\nenforcement powers under the Civil War Amendments\nupon finding that the legislation was constitutional as\napplied to the particular set of circumstances before the\nCourt.

A similar approach is warranted here.9\n  The VRA\u2019s exceptionally broad severability provision\nmakes it particularly inappropriate for the Court to allow\nShelby County to mount a facial challenge to \u00a7\u00a74(b) and 5\nof the VRA, even though application of those provisions to\nthe county falls well within the bounds of Congress\u2019 legis\u00ad\nlative authority. The severability provision states:\n     \u201cIf any provision of [this Act] or the application\n     thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid,\n     the remainder of [the Act] and the application of the\n     provision to other persons not similarly situated or\n     to other circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\u201d\n     42 U.

Nevertheless,\nthe Court asserts that Shelby County may prevail on its facial chal\u00ad\nlenge to \u00a74\u2019s coverage formula because it is subject to \u00a75\u2019s preclearance\nrequirement by virtue of that formula. See ante, at 22 (\u201cThe county\nwas selected [for preclearance] based on th[e] [coverage] formula.\u201d).\nThis misses the reality that Congress decided to subject Alabama to\npreclearance based on evidence of continuing constitutional violations\nin that State. See supra, at 28, n. 8.\n30               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Nevertheless, the Court suggests that limiting the\njurisdictional scope of the VRA in an appropriate case\nwould be \u201cto try our hand at updating the statute.\u201d Ante,\nat 22. Just last Term, however, the Court rejected this\nvery argument when addressing a materially identical\nseverability provision, explaining that such a provision is\n\u201cCongress\u2019 explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected\nthe remainder of [the Act]\u201d if any particular \u201capplication is\nunconstitutional.\u201d National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v.

Leaping to resolve Shelby County\u2019s facial\nchallenge without considering whether application of the\nVRA to Shelby County is constitutional, or even address\u00ad\ning the VRA\u2019s severability provision, the Court\u2019s opinion\ncan hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and\nmoderate decisionmaking.

In today\u2019s decision, the Court ratchets\nup what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing\nbreadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contra\u00ad\ndiction of Katzenbach. The Court does so with nary an\nexplanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone\nany discussion of whether stare decisis nonetheless coun\u00ad\nsels adherence to Katzenbach\u2019s ruling on the limited \u201csig\u00ad\nnificance\u201d of the equal sovereignty principle.\n   Today\u2019s unprecedented extension of the equal sover\u00ad\neignty principle outside its proper domain\u2014the admission\nof new States\u2014is capable of much mischief.

I am aware of no precedent for\nimposing such a double burden on defenders of legislation.\n                              C\n   The Court has time and again declined to upset legisla\u00ad\ntion of this genre unless there was no or almost no evi\u00ad\ndence of unconstitutional action by States. See, e.g., City\nof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 530 (1997) (legislative\nrecord \u201cmention[ed] no episodes [of the kind the legislation\naimed to check] occurring in the past 40 years\u201d). No such\nclaim can be made about the congressional record for the\n2006 VRA reauthorization. Given a record replete with\nexamples of denial or abridgment of a paramount federal\nright, the Court should have left the matter where it\nbelongs: in Congress\u2019 bailiwick.\n   Instead, the Court strikes \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage provision\nbecause, in its view, the provision is not based on \u201ccurrent\nconditions.\u201d Ante, at 17. It discounts, however, that one\nsuch condition was the preclearance remedy in place in\nthe covered jurisdictions, a remedy Congress designed\nboth to catch discrimination before it causes harm, and to\nguard against return to old ways. 2006 Reauthorization\n\u00a72(b)(3), (9). Volumes of evidence supported Congress\u2019 de\u00ad\ntermination that the prospect of retrogression was real.\nThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is\ncontinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like\nthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you\nare not getting wet.\n   But, the Court insists, the coverage formula is no good;\nit is based on \u201cdecades-old data and eradicated practices.\u201d\nAnte, at 18. Even if the legislative record shows, as engag\u00ad\ning with it would reveal, that the formula accurately\n34               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nidentifies the jurisdictions with the worst conditions of\nvoting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court\nsees it. Congress, the Court decrees, must \u201cstar[t] from\nscratch.\u201d Ante, at 23. I do not see why that should be so.\n   Congress\u2019 chore was different in 1965 than it was in\n2006. In 1965, there were a \u201csmall number of States . . .\nwhich in most instances were familiar to Congress by\nname,\u201d on which Congress fixed its attention. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 328. In drafting the coverage formula, \u201cCon\u00ad\ngress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting\ndiscrimination in a great majority of the States\u201d it sought\nto target. Id., at 329. \u201cThe formula [Congress] eventually\nevolved to describe these areas\u201d also captured a few States\nthat had not been the subject of congressional factfinding.\nIbid. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the formula in its\nentirety, finding it fair \u201cto infer a significant danger of the\nevil\u201d in all places the formula covered. Ibid.\n   The situation Congress faced in 2006, when it took up\nreauthorization of the coverage formula, was not the same.\nBy then, the formula had been in effect for many years,\nand all of the jurisdictions covered by it were \u201cfamiliar\nto Congress by name.\u201d Id., at 328. The question before\nCongress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support\ncontinued application of the preclearance remedy in each\nof those already-identified places? There was at that point\nno chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in\nnew areas that were not the subject of congressional\nfindings. And Congress could determine from the record\nwhether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for\u00ad\nmula still belonged under the preclearance regime. If they\ndid, there was no need to alter the formula. That is why\nthe Court, in addressing prior reauthorizations of the\nVRA, did not question the continuing \u201crelevance\u201d of the\nformula.\n   Consider once again the components of the record before\nCongress in 2006. The coverage provision identified a\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            35\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nknown list of places with an undisputed history of serious\nproblems with racial discrimination in voting. Recent\nevidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there\nfor all to see. Multiple Supreme Court decisions had\nupheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.\nThere was extensive evidence that, due to the preclear\u00ad\nance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions\nhad notably improved. And there was evidence that pre\u00ad\nclearance was still having a substantial real-world effect,\nhaving stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes\nin the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.\nIn addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in\nvoting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere,\nincreasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those\njurisdictions. And countless witnesses, reports, and case\nstudies documented continuing problems with voting dis\u00ad\ncrimination in those jurisdictions. In light of this rec\u00ad\nord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to\nconclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of\nsync with conditions on the ground in covered areas. And\ncertainly Shelby County was no candidate for release\nthrough the mechanism Congress provided. See supra, at\n22\u201323, 26\u201328.\n   The Court holds \u00a74(b) invalid on the ground that it is\n\u201cirrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40\nyears ago, when such tests have been illegal since that\ntime.\u201d Ante, at 23. But the Court disregards what Con\u00ad\ngress set about to do in enacting the VRA. That extraor\u00ad\ndinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests\nand devices that happened to exist in 1965. The grand\naim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizen\u00ad\nship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.\nAs the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abun\u00ad\ndantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting\nrights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as at\u00ad\ntempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that\n36               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noriginally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136, 8, 15\u201317.\n   The sad irony of today\u2019s decision lies in its utter failure\nto grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court\nappears to believe that the VRA\u2019s success in eliminating\nthe specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear\u00ad\nance is no longer needed. Ante, at 21\u201322, 23\u201324. With\nthat belief, and the argument derived from it, history\nrepeats itself. The same assumption\u2014that the problem\ncould be solved when particular methods of voting discrim\u00ad\nination are identified and eliminated\u2014was indulged and\nproved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA\u2019s enactment.\nUnlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or\ndevices, the VRA is grounded in Congress\u2019 recognition of\nthe \u201cvariety and persistence\u201d of measures designed to\nimpair minority voting rights. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at\n311; supra, at 2. In truth, the evolution of voting discrim\u00ad\nination into more subtle second-generation barriers is\npowerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclear\u00ad\nance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and\nprevent backsliding.\n   Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It\nis extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission\nlong delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize\nthe purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nFor a half century, a concerted effort has been made to\nend racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting\nRights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been\nachieved and continues to be made.\n   The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of\nthe VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the\nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee as \u201cone of\nthe most extensive considerations of any piece of legisla\u00ad\ntion that the United States Congress has dealt with in the\n27\u00bd years\u201d he had served in the House. 152 Cong.

Argued February 27, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to address entrenched racial\n  discrimination in voting, \u201can insidious and pervasive evil which had\n  been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting\n  and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.\u201d South Carolina v. Kat-\n  zenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309. Section 2 of the Act, which bans any\n  \u201cstandard, practice, or procedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or\n  abridgement of the right of any citizen . . . to vote on account of race\n  or color,\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a), applies nationwide, is permanent, and\n  is not at issue in this case. Other sections apply only to some parts of\n  the country. Section 4 of the Act provides the \u201ccoverage formula,\u201d de-\n  fining the \u201ccovered jurisdictions\u201d as States or political subdivisions\n  that maintained tests or devices as prerequisites to voting, and had\n  low voter registration or turnout, in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n  \u00a71973b(b). In those covered jurisdictions, \u00a75 of the Act provides that\n  no change in voting procedures can take effect until approved by\n  specified federal authorities in Washington, D. C. \u00a71973c(a). Such\n  approval is known as \u201cpreclearance.\u201d\n     The coverage formula and preclearance requirement were initially\n  set to expire after five years, but the Act has been reauthorized sev-\n  eral times. In 2006, the Act was reauthorized for an additional 25\n  years, but the coverage formula was not changed. Coverage still\n  turned on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test in the 1960s or\n  1970s, and had low voter registration or turnout at that time. Short-\n  ly after the 2006 reauthorization, a Texas utility district sought to\n  bail out from the Act\u2019s coverage and, in the alternative, challenged\n  the Act\u2019s constitutionality.

C., seeking a declaratory judgment that sections 4(b) and 5 are fa-\n    cially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction against\n    their enforcement. The District Court upheld the Act, finding that\n    the evidence before Congress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reau-\n    thorizing \u00a75 and continuing \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage formula. The D. C. Cir-\n    cuit affirmed. After surveying the evidence in the record, that court\n    accepted Congress\u2019s conclusion that \u00a72 litigation remained inade-\n    quate in the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minority\n    voters, that \u00a75 was therefore still necessary, and that the coverage\n    formula continued to pass constitutional muster.\nHeld: Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional; its formula\n can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to pre-\n clearance. Pp. 9\u201325.\n    (a) In Northwest Austin, this Court noted that the Voting Rights\n Act \u201cimposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs\u201d\n and concluded that \u201ca departure from the fundamental principle of\n equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute\u2019s disparate geo-\n graphic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d\n 557 U. S., at 203. These basic principles guide review of the question\n presented here. Pp. 9\u201317.\n      (1) State legislation may not contravene federal law. States re-\n tain broad autonomy, however, in structuring their governments and\n pursuing legislative objectives. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment re-\n serves to the States all powers not specifically granted to the Federal\n Government, including \u201cthe power to regulate elections.\u201d Gregory v.\n Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461\u2013462. There is also a \u201cfundamental prin-\n ciple of equal sovereignty\u201d among the States, which is highly perti-\n nent in assessing disparate treatment of States. Northwest Austin,\n supra, at 203.\n    The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic principles.\n It requires States to beseech the Federal Government for permission\n to implement laws that they would otherwise have the right to enact\n and execute on their own. And despite the tradition of equal sover-\n eignty, the Act applies to only nine States (and additional counties).\n That is why, in 1966, this Court described the Act as \u201cstringent\u201d and\n \u201cpotent,\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. The Court nonethe-\n less upheld the Act, concluding that such an \u201cuncommon exercise of\n congressional power\u201d could be justified by \u201cexceptional conditions.\u201d\n Id., at 334. Pp. 9\u201312.\n      (2) In 1966, these departures were justified by the \u201cblight of ra-\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

S.,\nat 308. At the time, the coverage formula\u2014the means of linking the\nexercise of the unprecedented authority with the problem that war-\nranted it\u2014made sense. The Act was limited to areas where Congress\nfound \u201cevidence of actual voting discrimination,\u201d and the covered ju-\nrisdictions shared two characteristics: \u201cthe use of tests and devices\nfor voter registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential elec-\ntion at least 12 points below the national average.\u201d Id., at 330. The\nCourt explained that \u201c[t]ests and devices are relevant to voting dis-\ncrimination because of their long history as a tool for perpetrating\nthe evil; a low voting rate is pertinent for the obvious reason that\nwidespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of\nactual voters.\u201d Ibid. The Court therefore concluded that \u201cthe cover-\nage formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\u201d Ibid.\nPp. 12\u201313.\n     (3) Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramatically.\nLargely because of the Voting Rights Act, \u201c[v]oter turnout and regis-\ntration rates\u201d in covered jurisdictions \u201cnow approach parity. Blatant-\nly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\u201d Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 202. The tests and devices that blocked ballot access have\nbeen forbidden nationwide for over 40 years. Yet the Act has not\neased \u00a75\u2019s restrictions or narrowed the scope of \u00a74\u2019s coverage formula\nalong the way. Instead those extraordinary and unprecedented fea-\ntures have been reauthorized as if nothing has changed, and they\nhave grown even stronger. Because \u00a75 applies only to those jurisdic-\ntions singled out by \u00a74, the Court turns to consider that provision.\nPp. 13\u201317.\n   (b) Section 4\u2019s formula is unconstitutional in light of current condi-\ntions. Pp. 17\u201325.\n     (1) In 1966, the coverage formula was \u201crational in both practice\nand theory.\u201d Katzenbach, supra, at 330. It looked to cause (discrimi-\nnatory tests) and effect (low voter registration and turnout), and tai-\nlored the remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting both.\nBy 2009, however, the \u201ccoverage formula raise[d] serious constitu-\ntional questions.\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. Coverage today\nis based on decades-old data and eradicated practices. The formula\ncaptures States by reference to literacy tests and low voter registra-\ntion and turnout in the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have\nbeen banned for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in covered States have risen dramatically. In 1965, the\nStates could be divided into those with a recent history of voting tests\nand low voter registration and turnout and those without those char-\n4                     SHELBY COUNTY v.

Congress based its coverage formula on that distinction.\n    Today the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Vot-\n    ing Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were. Pp. 17\u201318.\n         (2) The Government attempts to defend the formula on grounds\n    that it is \u201creverse-engineered\u201d\u2014Congress identified the jurisdictions\n    to be covered and then came up with criteria to describe them. Kat-\n    zenbach did not sanction such an approach, reasoning instead that\n    the coverage formula was rational because the \u201cformula . . . was rele-\n    vant to the problem.\u201d 383 U. S., at 329, 330. The Government has a\n    fallback argument\u2014because the formula was relevant in 1965, its\n    continued use is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in\n    the States identified in 1965. But this does not look to \u201ccurrent polit-\n    ical conditions,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, instead relying on a\n    comparison between the States in 1965. But history did not end in\n    1965. In assessing the \u201ccurrent need[ ]\u201d for a preclearance system\n    treating States differently from one another today, history since 1965\n    cannot be ignored. The Fifteenth Amendment is not designed to pun-\n    ish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. To serve\n    that purpose, Congress\u2014if it is to divide the States\u2014must identify\n    those jurisdictions to be singled out on a basis that makes sense in\n    light of current conditions. Pp. 18\u201321.\n         (3) Respondents also rely heavily on data from the record com-\n    piled by Congress before reauthorizing the Act. Regardless of how\n    one looks at that record, no one can fairly say that it shows anything\n    approaching the \u201cpervasive,\u201d \u201cflagrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201crampant\u201d\n    discrimination that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions\n    from the rest of the Nation in 1965. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315,\n    331. But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did not use\n    that record to fashion a coverage formula grounded in current condi-\n    tions.

HOLDER, JR., ATTORNEY GENERAL, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n    APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n                                [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the\nCourt.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary\nmeasures to address an extraordinary problem. Section 5\nof the Act required States to obtain federal permission\nbefore enacting any law related to voting\u2014a drastic depar-\nture from basic principles of federalism. And \u00a74 of the Act\napplied that requirement only to some States\u2014an equally\ndramatic departure from the principle that all States\nenjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but\nCongress determined it was needed to address entrenched\nracial discrimination in voting, \u201can insidious and perva-\nsive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of\nour country through unremitting and ingenious defiance\nof the Constitution.\u201d South Carolina v. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). As we explained in upholding\nthe law, \u201cexceptional conditions can justify legislative\nmeasures not otherwise appropriate.\u201d Id., at 334. Reflect-\ning the unprecedented nature of these measures, they\nwere scheduled to expire after five years. See Voting\nRights Act of 1965, \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438.\n2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed,\nthey have been made more stringent, and are now sched-\nuled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that\nthe conditions that originally justified these measures no\nlonger characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By\n2009, \u201cthe racial gap in voter registration and turnout\n[was] lower in the States originally covered by \u00a75 than it\n[was] nationwide.\u201d Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist.\nNo. One v. Holder, 557 U. S. 193, 203\u2013204 (2009). Since\nthat time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-\nAmerican voter turnout has come to exceed white voter\nturnout in five of the six States originally covered by \u00a75,\nwith a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one\npercent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Re-\nported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race and His-\npanic Origin, for States (Nov. 2012) (Table 4b).\n  At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no\none doubts that. The question is whether the Act\u2019s ex-\ntraordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of\nthe States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.\nAs we put it a short time ago, \u201cthe Act imposes current\nburdens and must be justified by current needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n   The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the\nwake of the Civil War. It provides that \u201c[t]he right of\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\nabridged by the United States or by any State on account\nof race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\u201d and it\ngives Congress the \u201cpower to enforce this article by appro-\npriate legislation.\u201d\n   \u201cThe first century of congressional enforcement of the\nAmendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.\u201d\nId., at 197.

Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 310.\nCongress passed statutes outlawing some of these practices\nand facilitating litigation against them, but litigation\nremained slow and expensive, and the States came up with\nnew ways to discriminate as soon as existing ones were\nstruck down. Voter registration of African-Americans\nbarely improved. Id., at 313\u2013314.\n    Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Con-\ngress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.\nSection 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any\n\u201cstandard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied\n. . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United\nStates to vote on account of race or color.\u201d 79 Stat. 437.\nThe current version forbids any \u201cstandard, practice, or\nprocedure\u201d that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the\nright of any citizen of the United States to vote on account\nof race or color.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). Both the Federal\nGovernment and individuals have sued to enforce \u00a72, see,\ne.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994), and\ninjunctive relief is available in appropriate cases to block\nvoting laws from going into effect, see 42 U. S. C.\n\u00a71973j(d). Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide,\nand is not at issue in this case.\n    Other sections targeted only some parts of the country.\nAt the time of the Act\u2019s passage, these \u201ccovered\u201d jurisdic-\ntions were those States or political subdivisions that had\nmaintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as\nof November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter\nregistration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election.\n\u00a74(b), 79 Stat. 438. Such tests or devices included literacy\nand knowledge tests, good moral character requirements,\nthe need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like.\n\u00a74(c), id., at 438\u2013439.

In 1965, the covered States\nincluded Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South\nCarolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivi-\nsions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in\nArizona. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App. (2012).\n  In those jurisdictions, \u00a74 of the Act banned all such tests\nor devices. \u00a74(a), 79 Stat. 438. Section 5 provided that no\nchange in voting procedures could take effect until it was\napproved by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.\u2014\neither the Attorney General or a court of three judges. Id.,\nat 439. A jurisdiction could obtain such \u201cpreclearance\u201d\nonly by proving that the change had neither \u201cthe purpose\n[nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on\naccount of race or color.\u201d Ibid.\n  Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they\nwere set to expire after five years. See \u00a74(a), id., at 438;\nNorthwest Austin, supra, at 199. In South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional\nchallenge, explaining that it was justified to address \u201cvot-\ning discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.\u201d\n383 U. S., at 308.\n  In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five\nyears, and extended the coverage formula in \u00a74(b) to juris-\ndictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent\nvoter registration or turnout as of 1968.

Congress also amend-\ned the definition of \u201ctest or device\u201d to include the practice\nof providing English-only voting materials in places where\nover five percent of voting-age citizens spoke a single\nlanguage other than English. \u00a7203, id., at 401\u2013402. As a\nresult of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,\nand Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-\nida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-\nkota, became covered jurisdictions. See 28 CFR pt. 51, App.\nCongress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to\nforbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in\na language minority group, in addition to discrimination\non the basis of race or color. \u00a7\u00a7203, 206, 89 Stat. 401, 402.\nFinally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and\ndevices permanent. \u00a7102, id., at 400.\n   In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but\ndid not alter its coverage formula. See Voting Rights Act\nAmendments, 96 Stat. 131. Congress did, however, amend\nthe bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of\ncovered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequi-\nsites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must\nnot have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive\npreclearance, or lost a \u00a72 suit, in the ten years prior to\nseeking bailout. \u00a72, id., at 131\u2013133.\n   We upheld each of these reauthorizations against con-\nstitutional challenge. See Georgia v. United States, 411\nU. S. 526 (1973); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S.\n156 (1980); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266\n(1999).\n   In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights\nAct for 25 years, again without change to its coverage\nformula.

Congress also amended \u00a75 to\nprohibit more conduct than before. \u00a75, id., at 580\u2013\n6                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n581; see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320,\n341 (2000) (Bossier II); Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461,\n479 (2003). Section 5 now forbids voting changes with\n\u201cany discriminatory purpose\u201d as well as voting changes\nthat diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race,\ncolor, or language minority status, \u201cto elect their preferred\ncandidates of choice.\u201d 42 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71973c(b)\u2013(d).\n   Shortly after this reauthorization, a Texas utility district\nbrought suit, seeking to bail out from the Act\u2019s cover-\nage and, in the alternative, challenging the Act\u2019s constitu-\ntionality. See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 200\u2013201. A\nthree-judge District Court explained that only a State or\npolitical subdivision was eligible to seek bailout under the\nstatute, and concluded that the utility district was not a\npolitical subdivision, a term that encompassed only \u201ccoun-\nties, parishes, and voter-registering subunits.\u201d Northwest\nAustin Municipal Util.

Conclud-\ning that \u201cunderlying constitutional concerns,\u201d among other\nthings, \u201ccompel[led] a broader reading of the bailout provi-\nsion,\u201d we construed the statute to allow the utility district\nto seek bailout. Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 207. In\ndoing so we expressed serious doubts about the Act\u2019s con-\ntinued constitutionality.\n   We explained that \u00a75 \u201cimposes substantial federalism\ncosts\u201d and \u201cdifferentiates between the States, despite our his-\ntoric tradition that all the States enjoy equal sovereignty.\u201d\nId., at 202, 203 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWe also noted that \u201c[t]hings have changed in the South.\nVoter turnout and registration rates now approach parity.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And minority candidates hold office at unprece-\ndented levels.\u201d Id., at 202. Finally, we questioned whether\nthe problems that \u00a75 meant to address were still \u201cconcen-\ntrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.\u201d\nId., at 203.\n   Eight Members of the Court subscribed to these views,\nand the remaining Member would have held the Act un-\nconstitutional. Ultimately, however, the Court\u2019s construc-\ntion of the bailout provision left the constitutional issues\nfor another day.\n                              B\n   Shelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdic-\ntion. It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General\nhas recently objected to voting changes proposed from\nwithin the county. See App. 87a\u201392a. Instead, in 2010,\nthe county sued the Attorney General in Federal District\nCourt in Washington, D.

The court found that the evidence before\nCongress in 2006 was sufficient to justify reauthorizing \u00a75\nand continuing the \u00a74(b) coverage formula.\n   The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit affirmed. In\nassessing \u00a75, the D. C. Circuit considered six primary\ncategories of evidence: Attorney General objections to\nvoting changes, Attorney General requests for more in-\nformation regarding voting changes, successful \u00a72 suits in\ncovered jurisdictions, the dispatching of federal observers\nto monitor elections in covered jurisdictions, \u00a75 preclear-\nance suits involving covered jurisdictions, and the deter-\nrent effect of \u00a75. See 679 F. 3d 848, 862\u2013863 (2012). After\nextensive analysis of the record, the court accepted Con-\n8                SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ngress\u2019s conclusion that \u00a72 litigation remained inadequate\nin the covered jurisdictions to protect the rights of minori-\nty voters, and that \u00a75 was therefore still necessary. Id.,\nat 873.\n   Turning to \u00a74, the D. C. Circuit noted that the evidence\nfor singling out the covered jurisdictions was \u201cless robust\u201d\nand that the issue presented \u201ca close question.\u201d Id., at\n879. But the court looked to data comparing the number\nof successful \u00a72 suits in the different parts of the country.\nCoupling that evidence with the deterrent effect of \u00a75, the\ncourt concluded that the statute continued \u201cto single out\nthe jurisdictions in which discrimination is concentrated,\u201d\nand thus held that the coverage formula passed constitu-\ntional muster. Id., at 883.\n   Judge Williams dissented. He found \u201cno positive cor-\nrelation between inclusion in \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage formula and\nlow black registration or turnout.\u201d Id., at 891. Rather,\nto the extent there was any correlation, it actually went\nthe other way: \u201ccondemnation under \u00a74(b) is a marker of\nhigher black registration and turnout.\u201d Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). Judge Williams also found that \u201c[c]overed juris-\ndictions have far more black officeholders as a proportion\nof the black population than do uncovered ones.\u201d Id., at\n892. As to the evidence of successful \u00a72 suits, Judge Wil-\nliams disaggregated the reported cases by State, and\nconcluded that \u201c[t]he five worst uncovered jurisdictions . . .\nhave worse records than eight of the covered jurisdic-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 897. He also noted that two covered juris-\ndictions\u2014Arizona and Alaska\u2014had not had any successful\nreported \u00a72 suit brought against them during the entire 24\nyears covered by the data. Ibid. Judge Williams would\nhave held the coverage formula of \u00a74(b) \u201cirrational\u201d and\nunconstitutional. Id., at 885.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U.

The\nFederal Government does not, however, have a general\nright to review and veto state enactments before they go\ninto effect. A proposal to grant such authority to \u201cnega-\ntive\u201d state laws was considered at the Constitutional\nConvention, but rejected in favor of allowing state laws to\ntake effect, subject to later challenge under the Supremacy\nClause.

Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and\nKatzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated\nas a bar on differential treatment outside that context.\n383 U. S., at 328\u2013329. At the same time, as we made clear\nin Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal\nsovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subse-\nquent disparate treatment of States. 557 U.

The Attorney\nGeneral has 60 days to object to a preclearance request,\nlonger if he requests more information. See 28 CFR\n\u00a7\u00a751.9, 51.37. If a State seeks preclearance from a three-\njudge court, the process can take years.\n   And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act\napplies to only nine States (and several additional coun-\nties). While one State waits months or years and expends\nfunds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor\ncan typically put the same law into effect immediately,\nthrough the normal legislative process. Even if a noncov-\nered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences\nbetween those proceedings and preclearance proceedings;\nthe preclearance proceeding \u201cnot only switches the burden\nof proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies\nsubstantive standards quite different from those govern-\ning the rest of the nation.\u201d 679 F. 3d, at 884 (Williams, J.,\ndissenting) (case below).\n   All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in\n1966, we described it as \u201cstringent\u201d and \u201cpotent.\u201d Katzen-\n12              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbach, 383 U. S., at 308, 315, 337. We recognized that it\n\u201cmay have been an uncommon exercise of congressional\npower,\u201d but concluded that \u201clegislative measures not oth-\nerwise appropriate\u201d could be justified by \u201cexceptional con-\nditions.\u201d Id., at 334. We have since noted that the Act\n\u201cauthorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state\nand local policymaking,\u201d Lopez, 525 U.

Etowah County Comm\u2019n,\n502 U. S. 491, 500\u2013501 (1992). As we reiterated in\nNorthwest Austin, the Act constitutes \u201cextraordinary\nlegislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.\u201d\n557 U. S., at 211.\n                             B\n  In 1966, we found these departures from the basic fea-\ntures of our system of government justified. The \u201cblight of\nracial discrimination in voting\u201d had \u201cinfected the electoral\nprocess in parts of our country for nearly a century.\u201d\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Several States had enacted\na variety of requirements and tests \u201cspecifically designed\nto prevent\u201d African-Americans from voting. Id., at 310.\nCase-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent\nsuch racial discrimination in voting, in part because\nStates \u201cmerely switched to discriminatory devices not\ncovered by the federal decrees,\u201d \u201cenacted difficult new\ntests,\u201d or simply \u201cdefied and evaded court orders.\u201d Id., at\n314. Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,\nonly 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were\nregistered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisi-\nana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Id., at 313.\nThose figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more\nbelow the figures for whites. Ibid.\n  In short, we concluded that \u201c[u]nder the compulsion of\nthese unique circumstances, Congress responded in a\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

We also\nnoted then and have emphasized since that this extra-\nordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to\nexpire after five years. Id., at 333; Northwest Austin,\nsupra, at 199.\n   At the time, the coverage formula\u2014the means of linking\nthe exercise of the unprecedented authority with the\nproblem that warranted it\u2014made sense. We found that\n\u201cCongress chose to limit its attention to the geographic\nareas where immediate action seemed necessary.\u201d Kat-\nzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328. The areas where Congress\nfound \u201cevidence of actual voting discrimination\u201d shared\ntwo characteristics: \u201cthe use of tests and devices for voter\nregistration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential\nelection at least 12 points below the national average.\u201d\nId., at 330. We explained that \u201c[t]ests and devices are\nrelevant to voting discrimination because of their long\nhistory as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate\nis pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disen-\nfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual\nvoters.\u201d Ibid. We therefore concluded that \u201cthe coverage\nformula [was] rational in both practice and theory.\u201d Ibid.\nIt accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely charac-\nterized by voting discrimination \u201con a pervasive scale,\u201d\nlinking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimi-\nnation and to the resulting disenfranchisement. Id., at\n308. The formula ensured that the \u201cstringent remedies\n[were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]\nbeen most flagrant.\u201d Id., at 315.\n                             C\n   Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-\ncally. Shelby County contends that the preclearance re-\nquirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,\nis now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal\nof force. In the covered jurisdictions, \u201c[v]oter turnout and\n14              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nregistration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discrim-\ninatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority\ncandidates hold office at unprecedented levels.\u201d Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 202. The tests and devices that\nblocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nation-\nwide for over 40 years. See \u00a76, 84 Stat. 315; \u00a7102, 89 Stat.\n400.\n   Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the\nsame when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that\n\u201c[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in-\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.\u201d\n\u00a72(b)(1), 120 Stat. 577. The House Report elaborated that\n\u201cthe number of African-Americans who are registered and\nwho turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly\nover the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,\u201d and noted\nthat \u201c[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote\nand cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white vot-\ners.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, p. 12 (2006). That Report\nalso explained that there have been \u201csignificant increases\nin the number of African-Americans serving in elected\noffices\u201d; more specifically, there has been approximately\na 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of\nAfrican-American elected officials in the six States origi-\nnally covered by the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 18.\n   The following chart, compiled from the Senate and\nHouse Reports, compares voter registration numbers from\n1965 to those from 2004 in the six originally covered\nStates.

Census Bureau data from the most recent election\nindicate that African-American voter turnout exceeded\nwhite voter turnout in five of the six States originally\ncovered by \u00a75, with a gap in the sixth State of less than\none half of one percent. See Dept. of Commerce, Census\nBureau, Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex, Race\nand Hispanic Origin, for States (Table 4b). The preclear-\nance statistics are also illuminating. In the first decade\nafter enactment of \u00a75, the Attorney General objected to\n14.2 percent of proposed voting changes. H. R Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, at 22. In the last decade before reenactment, the\nAttorney General objected to a mere 0.16 percent. S. Rep.\nNo. 109\u2013295, at 13.\n  There is no doubt that these improvements are in large\npart because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has proved\nimmensely successful at redressing racial discrimination\nand integrating the voting process. See \u00a72(b)(1), 120 Stat.\n577. During the \u201cFreedom Summer\u201d of 1964, in Philadel-\nphia, Mississippi, three men were murdered while work-\ning in the area to register African-American voters. See\nUnited States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 790 (1966). On\n\u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in 1965, in Selma, Alabama, police beat\n16              SHELBY COUNTY v.

See Northwest\nAustin, supra, at 220, n. 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Today both of\nthose towns are governed by African-American mayors.\nProblems remain in these States and others, but there is\nno denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation\nhas made great strides.\n   Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in \u00a75 or nar-\nrowed the scope of the coverage formula in \u00a74(b) along the\nway. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features\nwere reauthorized\u2014as if nothing had changed. In fact,\nthe Act\u2019s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.\nWhen Congress reauthorized the Act in 2006, it did so for\nanother 25 years on top of the previous 40\u2014a far cry from\nthe initial five-year period. See 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a)(8).\nCongress also expanded the prohibitions in \u00a75. We had\npreviously interpreted \u00a75 to prohibit only those redistrict-\ning plans that would have the purpose or effect of worsen-\ning the position of minority groups. See Bossier II, 528\nU. S., at 324, 335\u2013336. In 2006, Congress amended \u00a75\nto prohibit laws that could have favored such groups but\ndid not do so because of a discriminatory purpose, see 42\nU. S. C. \u00a71973c(c), even though we had stated that such\nbroadening of \u00a75 coverage would \u201cexacerbate the substan-\ntial federalism costs that the preclearance procedure\nalready exacts, perhaps to the extent of raising concerns\nabout \u00a75\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d Bossier II, supra, at 336\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In addi-\ntion, Congress expanded \u00a75 to prohibit any voting law\n\u201cthat has the purpose of or will have the effect of diminish-\ning the ability of any citizens of the United States,\u201d on\naccount of race, color, or language minority status, \u201cto\nelect their preferred candidates of choice.\u201d \u00a71973c(b).

S., at 203; see Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S., at 491\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring) (\u201cconsiderations of race that\nwould doom a redistricting plan under the Fourteenth\nAmendment or \u00a72 [of the Voting Rights Act] seem to be\nwhat save it under \u00a75\u201d). Nothing has happened since to\nalleviate this troubling concern about the current applica-\ntion of \u00a75.\n   Respondents do not deny that there have been im-\nprovements on the ground, but argue that much of this\ncan be attributed to the deterrent effect of \u00a75, which dis-\nsuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimina-\ntion that they would resume should \u00a75 be struck down.\nUnder this theory, however, \u00a75 would be effectively im-\nmune from scrutiny; no matter how \u201cclean\u201d the record\nof covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be\nmade that it was deterrence that accounted for the good\nbehavior.\n   The provisions of \u00a75 apply only to those jurisdictions\nsingled out by \u00a74. We now consider whether that coverage\nformula is constitutional in light of current conditions.\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n  When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage\nformula in 1966, we concluded that it was \u201crational in both\npractice and theory.\u201d Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 330. The\nformula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and ef-\nfect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the\nremedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting\nboth.\n  By 2009, however, we concluded that the \u201ccoverage\nformula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.\u201d North-\n18               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 204. As we explained, a stat-\nute\u2019s \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d must be justified by \u201ccurrent\nneeds,\u201d and any \u201cdisparate geographic coverage\u201d must be\n\u201csufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d Id., at\n203. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no\nlonger does so.\n  Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradi-\ncated practices. The formula captures States by reference\nto literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in\nthe 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been\nbanned nationwide for over 40 years. \u00a76, 84 Stat. 315;\n\u00a7102, 89 Stat. 400. And voter registration and turnout\nnumbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in\nthe years since. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at 12. Racial\ndisparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justi-\nfying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula.\nSee, e.g., Katzenbach, supra, at 313, 329\u2013330. There is no\nlonger such a disparity.\n  In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:\nthose with a recent history of voting tests and low voter\nregistration and turnout, and those without those charac-\nteristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that\ndistinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along\nthose lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it\nas if it were.\n                              B\n  The Government\u2019s defense of the formula is limited.\nFirst, the Government contends that the formula is \u201cre-\nverse-engineered\u201d: Congress identified the jurisdictions to\nbe covered and then came up with criteria to describe\nthem. Brief for Federal Respondent 48\u201349. Under that\nreasoning, there need not be any logical relationship be-\ntween the criteria in the formula and the reason for\ncoverage; all that is necessary is that the formula happen\nto capture the jurisdictions Congress wanted to single out.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   The Government suggests that Katzenbach sanctioned\nsuch an approach, but the analysis in Katzenbach was\nquite different. Katzenbach reasoned that the coverage\nformula was rational because the \u201cformula . . . was rele-\nvant to the problem\u201d: \u201cTests and devices are relevant to\nvoting discrimination because of their long history as a\ntool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate is pertinent\nfor the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchise-\nment must inevitably affect the number of actual voters.\u201d\n383 U. S., at 329, 330.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government\u2019s reverse-\nengineering argument does not even attempt to demon-\nstrate the continued relevance of the formula to the problem\nit targets. And in the context of a decision as significant\nas this one\u2014subjecting a disfavored subset of States\nto \u201cextraordinary legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our\nfederal system,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 211\u2014that\nfailure to establish even relevance is fatal.\n   The Government falls back to the argument that be-\ncause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use\nis permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the\nStates Congress identified back then\u2014regardless of how\nthat discrimination compares to discrimination in States\nunburdened by coverage. Brief for Federal Respondent\n49\u201350. This argument does not look to \u201ccurrent political\nconditions,\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 203, but instead\nrelies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That\ncomparison reflected the different histories of the North\nand South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by\nlaw until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim\nCrow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,\nand that state and local governments worked tirelessly to\ndisenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court\ninvoked that history\u2014rightly so\u2014in sustaining the dis-\nparate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. See\nKatzenbach, supra, at 308 (\u201cThe constitutional propriety of\n20              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be judged with refer-\nence to the historical experience which it reflects.\u201d).\n   But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act\nwas reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of\nit. In assessing the \u201ccurrent need[ ]\u201d for a preclearance\nsystem that treats States differently from one another\ntoday, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,\nlargely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were\nabolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout\ndue to race were erased, and African-Americans attained\npolitical office in record numbers. And yet the coverage\nformula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these\ndevelopments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-\nevant to decades-old problems, rather than current data\nreflecting current needs.\n   The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to\nvote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or\ncolor, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that\ncommand. The Amendment is not designed to punish for\nthe past; its purpose is to ensure a better future. See Rice\nv. Cayetano, 528 U. S. 495, 512 (2000) (\u201cConsistent with\nthe design of the Constitution, the [Fifteenth] Amendment\nis cast in fundamental terms, terms transcending the\nparticular controversy which was the immediate impetus\nfor its enactment.\u201d). To serve that purpose, Congress\u2014if it\nis to divide the States\u2014must identify those jurisdictions to\nbe singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of\ncurrent conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. We\nmade that clear in Northwest Austin, and we make it clear\nagain today.\n                             C\n  In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the\nintervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from\nthe record that they claim justify disparate coverage.\nCongress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The court below and\nthe parties have debated what that record shows\u2014they\nhave gone back and forth about whether to compare cov-\nered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to dis-\naggregate the data State by State, how to weigh \u00a72 cases\nas evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to\nconsider evidence not before Congress, among other is-\nsues. Compare, e.g., 679 F. 3d, at 873\u2013883 (case below),\nwith id., at 889\u2013902 (Williams, J., dissenting). Regardless\nof how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say\nthat it shows anything approaching the \u201cpervasive,\u201d \u201cfla-\ngrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201crampant\u201d discrimination that\nfaced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the\ncovered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that\ntime. Katzenbach, supra, at 308, 315, 331; Northwest\nAustin, 557 U. S., at 201.\n   But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did\nnot use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula\ngrounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a\nformula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical rela-\ntion to the present day. The dissent relies on \u201csecond-\ngeneration barriers,\u201d which are not impediments to the\ncasting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that\naffect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the\nproblem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as tar-\ngeting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of\ncontinued reliance on the \u00a74 coverage formula, which is\nbased on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote\ndilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an\nupdated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute\nourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.\nContrary to the dissent\u2019s contention, see post, at 23, we are\nnot ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it\nplayed no role in shaping the statutory formula before us\ntoday.\n   The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in\n22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlight of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county\ncannot complain about the provisions that subject it to\npreclearance. Post, at 23\u201330. But that is like saying that\na driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all\nredheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out\nhis license has expired. Shelby County\u2019s claim is that the\ncoverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its appli-\ncations, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-\njected to preclearance. The county was selected based on\nthat formula, and may challenge it in court.\n                             D\n   The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise.

But\nthis case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent\ndoes not emphasize\u2014the part that asks whether a legisla-\ntive means is \u201cconsist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the\nconstitution.\u201d The dissent states that \u201c[i]t cannot tenably\nbe maintained\u201d that this is an issue with regard to the\nVoting Rights Act, post, at 9, but four years ago, in an\nopinion joined by two of today\u2019s dissenters, the Court\nexpressly stated that \u201c[t]he Act\u2019s preclearance require-\nment and its coverage formula raise serious constitutional\nquestions.\u201d Northwest Austin, supra, at 204. The dissent\ndoes not explain how those \u201cserious constitutional ques-\ntions\u201d became untenable in four short years.\n   The dissent treats the Act as if it were just like any\nother piece of legislation, but this Court has made clear\nfrom the beginning that the Voting Rights Act is far from\nordinary.

S., at 334, 335. Multiple decisions\nsince have reaffirmed the Act\u2019s \u201cextraordinary\u201d nature.\nSee, e.g., Northwest Austin, supra, at 211. Yet the dissent\ngoes so far as to suggest instead that the preclearance\nrequirement and disparate treatment of the States should\nbe upheld into the future \u201cunless there [is] no or almost no\nevidence of unconstitutional action by States.\u201d Post, at 33.\n   In other ways as well, the dissent analyzes the ques-\ntion presented as if our decision in Northwest Austin never\nhappened. For example, the dissent refuses to con-\nsider the principle of equal sovereignty, despite Northwest\nAustin\u2019s emphasis on its significance. Northwest Austin\nalso emphasized the \u201cdramatic\u201d progress since 1965, 557\nU. S., at 201, but the dissent describes current levels of\ndiscrimination as \u201cflagrant,\u201d \u201cwidespread,\u201d and \u201cperva-\nsive,\u201d post, at 7, 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite the fact that Northwest Austin requires an Act\u2019s\n\u201cdisparate geographic coverage\u201d to be \u201csufficiently related\u201d\nto its targeted problems, 557 U. S., at 203, the dissent\nmaintains that an Act\u2019s limited coverage actually eases\nCongress\u2019s burdens, and suggests that a fortuitous rela-\ntionship should suffice. Although Northwest Austin stated\ndefinitively that \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d must be justified by\n\u201ccurrent needs,\u201d ibid., the dissent argues that the coverage\nformula can be justified by history, and that the required\nshowing can be weaker on reenactment than when the law\nwas first passed.\n   There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-\nmula from review merely because it was previously enacted\n40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in\n2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present cover-\nage formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to\ndistinguish between States in such a fundamental way\nbased on 40-year-old data, when today\u2019s statistics tell an\n24              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nentirely different story. And it would have been irrational\nto base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,\nwhen such tests have been illegal since that time. But\nthat is exactly what Congress has done.\n                         *    *    *\n   Striking down an Act of Congress \u201cis the gravest and\nmost delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.\u201d\nBlodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.,\nconcurring). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,\nwe took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of\nthe Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead\nresolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But\nin issuing that decision, we expressed our broader con-\ncerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress\ncould have updated the coverage formula at that time, but\ndid not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no\nchoice but to declare \u00a74(b) unconstitutional. The formula\nin that section can no longer be used as a basis for subject-\ning jurisdictions to preclearance.\n   Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nation-\nwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in \u00a72.\nWe issue no holding on \u00a75 itself, only on the coverage\nformula. Congress may draft another formula based on\ncurrent conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequi-\nsite to a determination that exceptional conditions still\nexist justifying such an \u201cextraordinary departure from the\ntraditional course of relations between the States and the\nFederal Government.\u201d Presley, 502 U. S., at 500\u2013501. Our\ncountry has changed, and while any racial discrimination\nin voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the\nlegislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to\ncurrent conditions.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the\nreasons.\n    \u201cThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary\nmeasures to address an extraordinary problem.\u201d Ante, at\n1. In the face of \u201cunremitting and ingenious defiance\u201d of\ncitizens\u2019 constitutionally protected right to vote, \u00a75 was\nnecessary to give effect to the Fifteenth Amendment in\nparticular regions of the country. South Carolina v. Katzen-\nbach, 383 U. S. 301, 309 (1966). Though \u00a75\u2019s preclear-\nance requirement represented a \u201cshar[p] depart[ure]\u201d from\n\u201cbasic principles\u201d of federalism and the equal sovereignty\nof the States, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure\nagainst early constitutional challenges because it was\nnecessary at the time to address \u201cvoting discrimination\nwhere it persist[ed] on a pervasive scale.\u201d Katzenbach,\nsupra, at 308.\n    Today, our Nation has changed. \u201c[T]he conditions that\noriginally justified [\u00a75] no longer characterize voting in the\ncovered jurisdictions.\u201d Ante, at 2. As the Court explains:\n\u201c \u2018[V]oter turnout and registration rates now approach\nparity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal de-\n2                SHELBY COUNTY v.

S.\n193, 202 (2009)).\n   In spite of these improvements, however, Congress\nincreased the already significant burdens of \u00a75. Following\nits reenactment in 2006, the Voting Rights Act was\namended to \u201cprohibit more conduct than before.\u201d Ante,\nat 5. \u201cSection 5 now forbids voting changes with \u2018any dis-\ncriminatory purpose\u2019 as well as voting changes that dimin-\nish the ability of citizens, on account of race, color, or\nlanguage minority status, \u2018to elect their preferred candi-\ndates of choice.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 6. While the pre-2006 version of\nthe Act went well beyond protection guaranteed under the\nConstitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520\nU. S. 471, 480\u2013482 (1997), it now goes even further.\n   It is, thus, quite fitting that the Court repeatedly points\nout that this legislation is \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cunprece-\ndented\u201d and recognizes the significant constitutional\nproblems created by Congress\u2019 decision to raise \u201cthe bar\nthat covered jurisdictions must clear,\u201d even as \u201cthe condi-\ntions justifying that requirement have dramatically im-\nproved.\u201d Ante, at 16\u201317. However one aggregates the\ndata compiled by Congress, it cannot justify the consider-\nable burdens created by \u00a75. As the Court aptly notes:\n\u201c[N]o one can fairly say that [the record] shows anything\napproaching the \u2018pervasive,\u2019 \u2018flagrant,\u2019 \u2018widespread,\u2019 and\n\u2018rampant\u2019 discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and\nthat clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from\nthe rest of the Nation at that time.\u201d Ante, at 21.

Congress was of\nanother mind. Recognizing that large progress has been\nmade, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec\u00ad\nord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir\u00ad\npated. The question this case presents is who decides\nwhether, as currently operative, \u00a75 remains justifiable,1\nthis Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to\nenforce the post-Civil War Amendments \u201cby appropriate\nlegislation.\u201d With overwhelming support in both Houses,\nCongress concluded that, for two prime reasons, \u00a75 should\ncontinue in force, unabated. First, continuance would\nfacilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far\nmade; and second, continuance would guard against back\u00ad\nsliding. Those assessments were well within Congress\u2019\nprovince to make and should elicit this Court\u2019s unstinting\napprobation.\n                             I\n  \u201c[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Court purports to declare unconstitutional only the coverage\n\nformula set out in \u00a74(b). See ante, at 24. But without that formula, \u00a75\nis immobilized.\n2               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 2. But the Court today terminates the remedy\nthat proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com\u00ad\nbat voting discrimination where other remedies had been\ntried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA\u2019s re\u00ad\nquirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting\nlaws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated\nrecords of rank discrimination against minority voting\nrights.\n   A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend\u00ad\nments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis\u00ad\ncrimination on the basis of race, the \u201cblight of racial\ndiscrimination in voting\u201d continued to \u201cinfec[t] the\nelectoral process in parts of our country.\u201d South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966). Early attempts to\ncope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.\nWhenever one form of voting discrimination was identified\nand prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court\nrepeatedly encountered the remarkable \u201cvariety and\npersistence\u201d of laws disenfranchising minority citizens.\nId., at 311. To take just one example, the Court, in 1927,\nheld unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters\nfrom participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon,\n273 U. S. 536, 541; in 1944, the Court struck down a\n\u201creenacted\u201d and slightly altered version of the same law,\nSmith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 658; and in 1953, the\nCourt once again confronted an attempt by Texas to \u201ccir\u00ad\ncumven[t]\u201d the Fifteenth Amendment by adopting yet\nanother variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams,\n345 U. S. 461, 469.\n   During this era, the Court recognized that discrimina\u00ad\ntion against minority voters was a quintessentially politi\u00ad\ncal problem requiring a political solution. As Justice\nHolmes explained: If \u201cthe great mass of the white popula\u00ad\ntion intends to keep the blacks from voting,\u201d \u201crelief from\n[that] great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Harris, 189\nU. S. 475, 488 (1903).\n   Congress learned from experience that laws targeting\nparticular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case\nlitigation were inadequate to the task. In the Civil Rights\nActs of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and\nthen expanded the power of \u201cthe Attorney General to seek\ninjunctions against public and private interference with\nthe right to vote on racial grounds.\u201d Katzenbach, 383\nU. S., at 313. But circumstances reduced the ameliorative\npotential of these legislative Acts:\n    \u201cVoting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, some\u00ad\n    times requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent\n    combing through registration records in preparation\n    for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part\n    because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded\n    voting officials and others involved in the proceed\u00ad\n    ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been\n    obtained, some of the States affected have merely\n    switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the\n    federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests de\u00ad\n    signed to prolong the existing disparity between white\n    and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local of\u00ad\n    ficials have defied and evaded court orders or have\n    simply closed their registration offices to freeze the\n    voting rolls.\u201d Id., at 314 (footnote omitted).\nPatently, a new approach was needed.\n   Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one\nof the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified\nexercises of federal legislative power in our Nation\u2019s his\u00ad\ntory. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting\nlaws in the covered jurisdictions\u2014those States and locali\u00ad\nties where opposition to the Constitution\u2019s commands were\n4                SHELBY COUNTY v.

Under the preclearance\nregime established by \u00a75 of the VRA, covered jurisdictions\nmust submit proposed changes in voting laws or proce\u00ad\ndures to the Department of Justice (DOJ), which has 60\ndays to respond to the changes. 79 Stat. 439, codified at\n42 U. S. C. \u00a71973c(a). A change will be approved unless\nDOJ finds it has \u201cthe purpose [or] . . . the effect of denying\nor abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\u201d\nIbid. In the alternative, the covered jurisdiction may seek\napproval by a three-judge District Court in the District of\nColumbia.\n   After a century\u2019s failure to fulfill the promise of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the\nVRA finally led to signal improvement on this front. \u201cThe\nJustice Department estimated that in the five years after\n[the VRA\u2019s] passage, almost as many blacks registered [to\nvote] in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North\nCarolina, and South Carolina as in the entire century\nbefore 1965.\u201d Davidson, The Voting Rights Act: A Brief\nHistory, in Controversies in Minority Voting 7, 21 (B.\nGrofman & C. Davidson eds. 1992). And in assessing the\noverall effects of the VRA in 2006, Congress found that\n\u201c[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first\ngeneration barriers experienced by minority voters, in\u00ad\ncluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,\nminority voter turnout, and minority representation in\nCongress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.

On that matter of cause and effects there\ncan be no genuine doubt.\n   Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the\nrealization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date,\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 181\n(1980). Congress also found that as \u201cregistration and\nvoting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures\nmay be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority\nvoting strength.\u201d Ibid. (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94\u2013196,\np. 10 (1975)). See also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630,\n640 (1993) (\u201c[I]t soon became apparent that guaranteeing\nequal access to the polls would not suffice to root out other\nracially discriminatory voting practices\u201d such as voting\ndilution). Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes,\nin contrast to direct attempts to block access to the bal\u00ad\nlot, are aptly described as \u201csecond-generation barriers\u201d to\nminority voting.\n   Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One\nof the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing\nof legislative districts in an \u201ceffort to segregate the races\nfor purposes of voting.\u201d Id., at 642. Another is adoption of\na system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district\nvoting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switch\u00ad\ning to at-large voting, the overall majority could control\nthe election of each city council member, effectively elimi\u00ad\nnating the potency of the minority\u2019s votes.

Whatever\nthe device employed, this Court has long recognized that\nvote dilution, when adopted with a discriminatory pur\u00ad\npose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of\naccess to the ballot.

Ante, at 4\u20135.\nEach time, this Court upheld the reauthorization as a\nvalid exercise of congressional power. Ante, at 5. As the\n1982 reauthorization approached its 2007 expiration date,\nCongress again considered whether the VRA\u2019s preclear\u00ad\nance mechanism remained an appropriate response to the\nproblem of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions.\n   Congress did not take this task lightly. Quite the oppo\u00ad\nsite. The 109th Congress that took responsibility for the\nrenewal started early and conscientiously.

Each of these Amendments contains the\nsame broad empowerment of Congress to enact \u201cappropriate legisla\u00ad\ntion\u201d to enforce the protected right. The implication is unmistakable:\nUnder our constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead rein in\nmaking the right to vote equally real for all U. S. citizens.

Rev. 153, 182 (1997)\n(quoting Civil War-era framer that \u201cthe remedy for the\nviolation of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments\nwas expressly not left to the courts. The remedy was\nlegislative.\u201d).\n   The stated purpose of the Civil War Amendments was to\narm Congress with the power and authority to protect all\npersons within the Nation from violations of their rights\nby the States. In exercising that power, then, Congress\nmay use \u201call means which are appropriate, which are\nplainly adapted\u201d to the constitutional ends declared by\nthese Amendments. McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421. So\nwhen Congress acts to enforce the right to vote free from\nracial discrimination, we ask not whether Congress has\nchosen the means most wise, but whether Congress has\nrationally selected means appropriate to a legitimate end.\n\u201cIt is not for us to review the congressional resolution of\n[the need for its chosen remedy]. It is enough that we be\nable to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might\nresolve the conflict as it did.\u201d Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384\nU. S. 641, 653 (1966).\n   Until today, in considering the constitutionality of the\nVRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of\nrespect its judgments in this domain should garner. South\nCarolina v. Katzenbach supplies the standard of review:\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n\u201cAs against the reserved powers of the States, Congress\nmay use any rational means to effectuate the constitu\u00ad\ntional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting.\u201d 383\nU. S., at 324. Faced with subsequent reauthorizations of\nthe VRA, the Court has reaffirmed this standard. E.g.,\nCity of Rome, 446 U. S., at 178. Today\u2019s Court does not\npurport to alter settled precedent establishing that the\ndispositive question is whether Congress has employed\n\u201crational means.\u201d\n   For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing\nstatute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require\u00ad\nments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization\nis at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative\nrecord justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en\u00ad\ntitled to consider that preexisting record as well as the\nrecord before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.\nThis is especially true where, as here, the Court has re\u00ad\npeatedly affirmed the statute\u2019s constitutionality and Con\u00ad\ngress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.\nSee id., at 174 (\u201cThe appellants are asking us to do noth\u00ad\ning less than overrule our decision in South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach . . . , in which we upheld the constitutionality\nof the Act.\u201d); Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266, 283\n(1999) (similar).\n   Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary\narises because Congress has built a temporal limitation\ninto the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of\nyears (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary\nevidence, the continued need for the VRA. Cf. Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 343 (2003) (anticipating, but not\nguaranteeing, that, in 25 years, \u201cthe use of racial prefer\u00ad\nences [in higher education] will no longer be necessary\u201d).\n   Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup\u00ad\nporting reauthorization to be less stark than the record\noriginally made. Demand for a record of violations equiva\u00ad\nlent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a\n12               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncatch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less\nevidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that\nCongress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In\ncontrast, if the statute was not working, there would be\nplenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to\nrenew a failed regulatory regime. See Persily 193\u2013194.\n  This is not to suggest that congressional power in this\narea is limitless. It is this Court\u2019s responsibility to ensure\nthat Congress has used appropriate means. The question\nmeet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are\n\u201cadapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in\nview.\u201d Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346 (1880). The\nCourt\u2019s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that\nof Congress, but to determine whether the legislative\nrecord sufficed to show that \u201cCongress could rationally\nhave determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro\u00ad\npriate methods.\u201d City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 176\u2013177.\n  In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in\nCongress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to\ncombat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has\nrepeatedly reaffirmed Congress\u2019 prerogative to use any\nrational means in exercise of its power in this area. And\nboth precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means\ntest should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the\nstatute\u2019s challenger should be higher, when what is at\nissue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has\npreviously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con\u00ad\ntemporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla\u00ad\nture\u2019s legitimate objective.\n                               III\n  The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully\nsatisfies the standard stated in McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at\n421: Congress may choose any means \u201cappropriate\u201d and\n\u201cplainly adapted to\u201d a legitimate constitutional end. As we\nshall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The surest\nway to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is\nto see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim\u00ad\ninatory changes to voting laws. See City of Rome, 446\nU. S., at 181 (identifying \u201cinformation on the number and\ntypes of submissions made by covered jurisdictions and\nthe number and nature of objections interposed by the\nAttorney General\u201d as a primary basis for upholding the\n1975 reauthorization). On that score, the record before\nCongress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were\nmore DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than\nthere were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization\n(490). 1 Voting Rights Act: Evidence of Continued Need,\nHearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of\nthe House Committee on the Judiciary, 109th Cong., 2d\nSess., p. 172 (2006) (hereinafter Evidence of Continued\nNeed).\n   All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked\nover 700 voting changes based on a determination that the\nchanges were discriminatory. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at\n21. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections\nincluded findings of discriminatory intent, see 679 F. 3d,\nat 867, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were\n\u201ccalculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully\nparticipating in the political process.\u201d H. R. Rep. 109\u2013478,\nat 21. On top of that, over the same time period the DOJ\nand private plaintiffs succeeded in more than 100 actions\nto enforce the \u00a75 preclearance requirements. 1 Evidence\nof Continued Need 186, 250.\n   In addition to blocking proposed voting changes through\npreclearance, DOJ may request more information from a\njurisdiction proposing a change.

No. 109\u2013478, at 40\u201341.4 Congress also\nreceived empirical studies finding that DOJ\u2019s requests for\nmore information had a significant effect on the degree to\nwhich covered jurisdictions \u201ccompl[ied] with their obliga\u00ad\ntio[n]\u201d to protect minority voting rights. 2 Evidence of\nContinued Need 2555.\n   Congress also received evidence that litigation under \u00a72\nof the VRA was an inadequate substitute for preclearance\nin the covered jurisdictions. Litigation occurs only after\nthe fact, when the illegal voting scheme has already been\nput in place and individuals have been elected pursuant to\nit, thereby gaining the advantages of incumbency. 1 Evi\u00ad\ndence of Continued Need 97.

HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress further received evidence indicating that\nformal requests of the kind set out above represented only\nthe tip of the iceberg. There was what one commentator\ndescribed as an \u201cavalanche of case studies of voting rights\nviolations in the covered jurisdictions,\u201d ranging from\n\u201coutright intimidation and violence against minority\nvoters\u201d to \u201cmore subtle forms of voting rights depriva\u00ad\ntions.\u201d Persily 202 (footnote omitted). This evidence gave\nCongress ever more reason to conclude that the time had\nnot yet come for relaxed vigilance against the scourge of\nrace discrimination in voting.\n   True, conditions in the South have impressively im\u00ad\nproved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress\nnoted this improvement and found that the VRA was the\ndriving force behind it. 2006 Reauthorization \u00a72(b)(1).\nBut Congress also found that voting discrimination had\nevolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that\neliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that\nhad been made. \u00a7\u00a72(b)(2), (9). Concerns of this order, the\nCourt previously found, gave Congress adequate cause to\nreauthorize the VRA. City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 180\u2013182\n(congressional reauthorization of the preclearance re\u00ad\nquirement was justified based on \u201cthe number and nature\nof objections interposed by the Attorney General\u201d since\nthe prior reauthorization; extension was \u201cnecessary to pre\u00ad\nserve the limited and fragile achievements of the Act and\nto promote further amelioration of voting discrimination\u201d)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Facing such evidence\nthen, the Court expressly rejected the argument that\ndisparities in voter turnout and number of elected officials\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nprecleared the law after adopting both interpretations as an express\n\u201ccondition of preclearance.\u201d Id., at 37\u201338.

Ibid.\n                              B\n  I turn next to the evidence on which Congress based its\ndecision to reauthorize the coverage formula in \u00a74(b).\nBecause Congress did not alter the coverage formula, the\nsame jurisdictions previously subject to preclearance\ncontinue to be covered by this remedy. The evidence just\ndescribed, of preclearance\u2019s continuing efficacy in blocking\nconstitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself\ngrounded Congress\u2019 conclusion that the remedy should be\nretained for those jurisdictions.\n  There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris\u00ad\ndictions have a unique history of problems with racial\ndiscrimination in voting. Ante, at 12\u201313. Consideration of\nthis long history, still in living memory, was altogether\nappropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to\nrecognize that \u201chistory did not end in 1965.\u201d Ante, at 20.\nBut the Court ignores that \u201cwhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d W.\nShakespeare, The Tempest, act 2, sc. 1. And \u201c[t]hose who\ncannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d 1\nG. Santayana, The Life of Reason 284 (1905). Congress\nwas especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains\nalready made and to prevent backsliding. 2006 Reauthor\u00ad\nization \u00a72(b)(9).\n  Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou\u00ad\nsands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,\nconditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that\nthe formula was still justified by \u201ccurrent needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203.\n  Congress learned of these conditions through a report,\nknown as the Katz study, that looked at \u00a72 suits between\n1982 and 2004. To Examine the Impact and Effectiveness\nof the Voting Rights Act: Hearing before the Subcommit\u00ad\ntee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the\n20                  SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                        GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nJudiciary, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 964\u20131124 (2005)\n(hereinafter Impact and Effectiveness). Because the pri\u00ad\nvate right of action authorized by \u00a72 of the VRA applies\nnationwide, a comparison of \u00a72 lawsuits in covered and\nnoncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick\nfor measuring differences between covered and noncovered\njurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimi\u00ad\nnation between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had\ndisappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful\n\u00a72 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas.6 The\nstudy\u2019s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimi\u00ad\nnation in voting remains \u201cconcentrated in the jurisdictions\nsingled out for preclearance.\u201d Northwest Austin, 557 U. S.,\nat 203.\n  Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25\npercent of the country\u2019s population, the Katz study re\u00ad\nvealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful\n\u00a72 litigation since 1982. Impact and Effectiveness 974.\nControlling for population, there were nearly four times as\nmany successful \u00a72 cases in covered jurisdictions as there\nwere in noncovered jurisdictions. 679 F. 3d, at 874. The\nKatz study further found that \u00a72 lawsuits are more likely\nto succeed when they are filed in covered jurisdictions\nthan in noncovered jurisdictions. Impact and Effective\u00ad\nness 974. From these findings\u2014ignored by the Court\u2014\nCongress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula\ncontinues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.\n  The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated\nthat voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially\npolarized than elsewhere in the country. H. R. Rep. No.\n109\u2013478, at 34\u201335. While racially polarized voting alone\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Because preclearance occurs only in covered jurisdictions and can be\n\nexpected to stop the most obviously objectionable measures, one would\nexpect a lower rate of successful \u00a72 lawsuits in those jurisdictions if\nthe risk of voting discrimination there were the same as elsewhere in the\ncountry.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The reason is twofold.\nFirst, racial polarization means that racial minorities are\nat risk of being systematically outvoted and having their\ninterests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, \u201cwhen\npolitical preferences fall along racial lines, the natural\ninclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench\nthemselves have predictable racial effects. Under circum\u00ad\nstances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain politi\u00ad\ncal advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.\u201d\nAnsolabehere, Persily, & Stewart, Regional Differences\nin Racial Polarization in the 2012 Presidential Election:\nImplications for the Constitutionality of Section 5 of the\nVoting Rights Act, 126 Harv. L. Rev. Forum 205, 209\n(2013).\n  In other words, a governing political coalition has an\nincentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of\nvoting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by\nthe ruling party to pursue that incentive \u201cwill inevitably\ndiscriminate against a racial group.\u201d Ibid. Just as build\u00ad\nings in California have a greater need to be earthquake\u00ad\nproofed, places where there is greater racial polarization\nin voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to\nprevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was\nunderstood by Congress and is well recognized in the\nacademic literature. See 2006 Reauthorization \u00a72(b)(3),\n120 Stat. 577 (\u201cThe continued evidence of racially polar\u00ad\nized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by the\n[preclearance requirement] demonstrates that racial and\nlanguage minorities remain politically vulnerable\u201d); H. R.\nRep. No. 109\u2013478, at 35; Davidson, The Recent Evolution\nof Voting Rights Law Affecting Racial and Language\nMinorities, in Quiet Revolution 21, 22.\n  The case for retaining a coverage formula that met\nneeds on the ground was therefore solid. Congress might\n22              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nhave been charged with rigidity had it afforded covered\njurisdictions no way out or ignored jurisdictions that\nneeded superintendence. Congress, however, responded to\nthis concern. Critical components of the congressional\ndesign are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions\nto \u201cbail out\u201d of preclearance, and for court-ordered \u201cbail\nins.\u201d See Northwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 199. The VRA\npermits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has\ncomplied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in\nefforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of vot\u00ad\ners. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973b(a) (2006 ed. and Supp. V). It also\nauthorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to\nfederal preclearance upon finding that violations of the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred\nthere. \u00a71973a(c) (2006 ed.).\n   Congress was satisfied that the VRA\u2019s bailout mecha\u00ad\nnism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA\u2019s\ncoverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109\u2013478, at 25 (the\nsuccess of bailout \u201cillustrates that: (1) covered status is\nneither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status\nhas been and continues to be within the control of the\njurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu\u00ad\ninely clean record and want to terminate coverage have\nthe ability to do so\u201d). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc\u00ad\ncessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and\nDOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an\neligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure\nbecame effective in 1984. Brief for Federal Respondent 54.\nThe bail-in mechanism has also worked. Several jurisdic\u00ad\ntions have been subject to federal preclearance by court\norders, including the States of New Mexico and Arkansas.\nApp. to Brief for Federal Respondent 1a\u20133a.\n   This experience exposes the inaccuracy of the Court\u2019s\nportrayal of the Act as static, unchanged since 1965.\nCongress designed the VRA to be a dynamic statute, capa\u00ad\nble of adjusting to changing conditions. True, many cov\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The same cannot be\nsaid of the Court\u2019s opinion today. The Court makes no\ngenuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative\nrecord that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on\nincreases in voter registration and turnout as if that were\nthe whole story. See supra, at 18\u201319. Without even\nidentifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively\nbrushes off arguments based on \u201cdata from the record,\u201d and\ndeclines to enter the \u201cdebat[e about] what [the] record\nshows.\u201d Ante, at 20\u201321. One would expect more from an\nopinion striking at the heart of the Nation\u2019s signal piece of\ncivil-rights legislation.\n  I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,\ngiven its usual restraint, does the Court even address\nShelby County\u2019s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the\nCourt veers away from controlling precedent regarding the\n\u201cequal sovereignty\u201d doctrine without even acknowledging\nthat it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect\nordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil\nWar Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not\neven deign to grapple with the legislative record.\n                             A\n  Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the\nVRA\u2019s 2006 reauthorization. \u201cA facial challenge to a\nlegislative Act,\u201d the Court has other times said, \u201cis, of\ncourse, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,\nsince the challenger must establish that no set of circum\u00ad\n24              SHELBY COUNTY v.

S., at 610. Yet the Court\u2019s opinion in\nthis case contains not a word explaining why Congress\nlacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular\nplaintiff that initiated this lawsuit\u2014Shelby County, Ala\u00ad\nbama. The reason for the Court\u2019s silence is apparent, for\nas applied to Shelby County, the VRA\u2019s preclearance\nrequirement is hardly contestable.\n   Alabama is home to Selma, site of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d\nbeatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the\ncatalyst for the VRA\u2019s enactment. Following those events,\nMartin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont\u00ad\ngomery, Alabama\u2019s capital, where he called for passage of\nthe VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be\nmade even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast\nnational commitment to see the task through to comple\u00ad\ntion. In King\u2019s words, \u201cthe arc of the moral universe is\nlong, but it bends toward justice.\u201d G. May, Bending To\u00ad\nward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transfor\u00ad\nmation of American Democracy 144 (2013).\n   History has proved King right. Although circumstances\nin Alabama have changed, serious concerns remain.\nBetween 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest\nrates of successful \u00a72 suits, second only to its VRA-covered\n                      Cite as: 570 U.

In other words, even while subject to the\nrestraining effect of \u00a75, Alabama was found to have\n\u201cdeni[ed] or abridge[d]\u201d voting rights \u201con account of race or\ncolor\u201d more frequently than nearly all other States in the\nUnion. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71973(a). This fact prompted the\ndissenting judge below to concede that \u201ca more narrowly\ntailored coverage formula\u201d capturing Alabama and a\nhandful of other jurisdictions with an established track\nrecord of racial discrimination in voting \u201cmight be defensi\u00ad\nble.\u201d 679 F. 3d, at 897 (opinion of Williams, J.). That is an\nunderstatement. Alabama\u2019s sorry history of \u00a72 violations\nalone provides sufficient justification for Congress\u2019 deter\u00ad\nmination in 2006 that the State should remain subject to\n\u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement.7\n  A few examples suffice to demonstrate that, at least in\nAlabama, the \u201ccurrent burdens\u201d imposed by \u00a75\u2019s preclear\u00ad\nance requirement are \u201cjustified by current needs.\u201d North-\nwest Austin, 557 U. S., at 203. In the interim between the\nVRA\u2019s 1982 and 2006 reauthorizations, this Court twice\nconfronted purposeful racial discrimination in Alabama.\nIn Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),\nthe Court held that Pleasant Grove\u2014a city in Jefferson\nCounty, Shelby County\u2019s neighbor\u2014engaged in purposeful\ndiscrimination by annexing all-white areas while rejecting\nthe annexation request of an adjacent black neighborhood.\nThe city had \u201cshown unambiguous opposition to racial\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 This lawsuit was filed by Shelby County, a political subdivision of\n\nAlabama, rather than by the State itself. Nevertheless, it is appropri\u00ad\nate to judge Shelby County\u2019s constitutional challenge in light of in\u00ad\nstances of discrimination statewide because Shelby County is subject to\n\u00a75\u2019s preclearance requirement by virtue of Alabama\u2019s designation as a\ncovered jurisdiction under \u00a74(b) of the VRA. See ante, at 7. In any\nevent, Shelby County\u2019s recent record of employing an at-large electoral\nsystem tainted by intentional racial discrimination is by itself sufficient\nto justify subjecting the county to \u00a75\u2019s preclearance mandate.

Recording devices worn by\nstate legislators cooperating with the FBI\u2019s investigation\ncaptured conversations between members of the state\nlegislature and their political allies. The recorded conver\u00ad\nsations are shocking. Members of the state Senate deri\u00ad\nsively refer to African-Americans as \u201cAborigines\u201d and talk\nopenly of their aim to quash a particular gambling-related\nreferendum because the referendum, if placed on the\nballot, might increase African-American voter turnout.\nId., at 1345\u20131346 (internal quotation marks omitted). See\nalso id., at 1345 (legislators and their allies expressed\nconcern that if the referendum were placed on the ballot,\n\u201c \u2018[e]very black, every illiterate\u2019 would be \u2018bused [to the\npolls] on HUD financed buses\u2019 \u201d). These conversations oc\u00ad\ncurred not in the 1870\u2019s, or even in the 1960\u2019s, they took\nplace in 2010. Id., at 1344\u20131345. The District Judge\npresiding over the criminal trial at which the recorded\nconversations were introduced commented that the \u201cre\u00ad\n28                 SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                       GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\ncordings represent compelling evidence that political\nexclusion through racism remains a real and enduring\nproblem\u201d in Alabama. Id., at 1347. Racist sentiments, the\njudge observed, \u201cremain regrettably entrenched in the\nhigh echelons of state government.\u201d Ibid.\n  These recent episodes forcefully demonstrate that \u00a75\u2019s\npreclearance requirement is constitutional as applied to\nAlabama and its political subdivisions.8 And under our\ncase law, that conclusion should suffice to resolve this\ncase. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 24\u201325\n(1960) (\u201c[I]f the complaint here called for an application of\nthe statute clearly constitutional under the Fifteenth\nAmendment, that should have been an end to the question\nof constitutionality.\u201d). See also Nevada Dept. of Human\nResources v. Hibbs, 538 U. S. 721, 743 (2003) (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting) (where, as here, a state or local government\nraises a facial challenge to a federal statute on the ground\nthat it exceeds Congress\u2019 enforcement powers under the\nCivil War Amendments, the challenge fails if the opposing\nparty is able to show that the statute \u201ccould constitution\u00ad\nally be applied to some jurisdictions\u201d).\n  This Court has consistently rejected constitutional\nchallenges to legislation enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019\nenforcement powers under the Civil War Amendments\nupon finding that the legislation was constitutional as\napplied to the particular set of circumstances before the\nCourt. See United States v. Georgia, 546 U.

S., at 24\u201326 (federal statute\nproscribing deprivations of the right to vote based on race\nwas constitutional as applied to the state officials before\nthe Court, even if it could not constitutionally be applied\nto other parties). A similar approach is warranted here.9\n  The VRA\u2019s exceptionally broad severability provision\nmakes it particularly inappropriate for the Court to allow\nShelby County to mount a facial challenge to \u00a7\u00a74(b) and 5\nof the VRA, even though application of those provisions to\nthe county falls well within the bounds of Congress\u2019 legis\u00ad\nlative authority. The severability provision states:\n     \u201cIf any provision of [this Act] or the application\n     thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid,\n     the remainder of [the Act] and the application of the\n     provision to other persons not similarly situated or\n     to other circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\u201d\n     42 U. S. C. \u00a71973p.\nIn other words, even if the VRA could not constitutionally\nbe applied to certain States\u2014e.g., Arizona and Alaska, see\nante, at 8\u2014\u00a71973p calls for those unconstitutional applica\u00ad\ntions to be severed, leaving the Act in place for juris\u00ad\ndictions as to which its application does not transgress\nconstitutional limits.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   9 The Court does not contest that Alabama\u2019s history of racial discrim\u00ad\n\nination provides a sufficient basis for Congress to require Alabama and\nits political subdivisions to preclear electoral changes. Nevertheless,\nthe Court asserts that Shelby County may prevail on its facial chal\u00ad\nlenge to \u00a74\u2019s coverage formula because it is subject to \u00a75\u2019s preclearance\nrequirement by virtue of that formula. See ante, at 22 (\u201cThe county\nwas selected [for preclearance] based on th[e] [coverage] formula.\u201d).\nThis misses the reality that Congress decided to subject Alabama to\npreclearance based on evidence of continuing constitutional violations\nin that State. See supra, at 28, n. 8.\n30               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n   Nevertheless, the Court suggests that limiting the\njurisdictional scope of the VRA in an appropriate case\nwould be \u201cto try our hand at updating the statute.\u201d Ante,\nat 22. Just last Term, however, the Court rejected this\nvery argument when addressing a materially identical\nseverability provision, explaining that such a provision is\n\u201cCongress\u2019 explicit textual instruction to leave unaffected\nthe remainder of [the Act]\u201d if any particular \u201capplication is\nunconstitutional.\u201d National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. Sebelius, 567 U.

S., at 23 (a statute capable of some\nconstitutional applications may nonetheless be susceptible\nto a facial challenge only in \u201cthat rarest of cases where\nthis Court can justifiably think itself able confidently to\ndiscern that Congress would not have desired its legisla\u00ad\ntion to stand at all unless it could validly stand in its every\napplication\u201d). Leaping to resolve Shelby County\u2019s facial\nchallenge without considering whether application of the\nVRA to Shelby County is constitutional, or even address\u00ad\ning the VRA\u2019s severability provision, the Court\u2019s opinion\ncan hardly be described as an exemplar of restrained and\nmoderate decisionmaking. Quite the opposite. Hubris is a\nfit word for today\u2019s demolition of the VRA.\n                              B\n  The Court stops any application of \u00a75 by holding that\n\u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage formula is unconstitutional. It pins this\nresult, in large measure, to \u201cthe fundamental principle of\nequal sovereignty.\u201d Ante, at 10\u201311, 23. In Katzenbach,\nhowever, the Court held, in no uncertain terms, that the\nprinciple \u201capplies only to the terms upon which States are\nadmitted to the Union, and not to the remedies for local\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

S., at\n328\u2013329 (emphasis added).\n   Katzenbach, the Court acknowledges, \u201crejected the\nnotion that the [equal sovereignty] principle operate[s] as\na bar on differential treatment outside [the] context [of the\nadmission of new States].\u201d Ante, at 11 (citing 383 U. S., at\n328\u2013329) (emphasis omitted). But the Court clouds that\nonce clear understanding by citing dictum from Northwest\nAustin to convey that the principle of equal sovereignty\n\u201cremains highly pertinent in assessing subsequent dispar\u00ad\nate treatment of States.\u201d Ante, at 11 (citing 557 U. S., at\n203). See also ante, at 23 (relying on Northwest Austin\u2019s\n\u201cemphasis on [the] significance\u201d of the equal-sovereignty\nprinciple). If the Court is suggesting that dictum in\nNorthwest Austin silently overruled Katzenbach\u2019s limita\u00ad\ntion of the equal sovereignty doctrine to \u201cthe admission of\nnew States,\u201d the suggestion is untenable. Northwest\nAustin cited Katzenbach\u2019s holding in the course of declin-\ning to decide whether the VRA was constitutional or even\nwhat standard of review applied to the question. 557\nU. S., at 203\u2013204. In today\u2019s decision, the Court ratchets\nup what was pure dictum in Northwest Austin, attributing\nbreadth to the equal sovereignty principle in flat contra\u00ad\ndiction of Katzenbach. The Court does so with nary an\nexplanation of why it finds Katzenbach wrong, let alone\nany discussion of whether stare decisis nonetheless coun\u00ad\nsels adherence to Katzenbach\u2019s ruling on the limited \u201csig\u00ad\nnificance\u201d of the equal sovereignty principle.\n   Today\u2019s unprecedented extension of the equal sover\u00ad\neignty principle outside its proper domain\u2014the admission\nof new States\u2014is capable of much mischief. Federal statutes\nthat treat States disparately are hardly novelties. See,\ne.g., 28 U. S. C. \u00a73704 (no State may operate or permit a\nsports-related gambling scheme, unless that State con\u00ad\nducted such a scheme \u201cat any time during the period\nbeginning January 1, 1976, and ending August 31, 1990\u201d);\n32              SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\n26 U. S. C. \u00a7142(l) (EPA required to locate green building\nproject in a State meeting specified population criteria); 42\nU. S. C. \u00a73796bb (at least 50 percent of rural drug en\u00ad\nforcement assistance funding must be allocated to States\nwith \u201ca population density of fifty-two or fewer persons per\nsquare mile or a State in which the largest county has\nfewer than one hundred and fifty thousand people, based\non the decennial census of 1990 through fiscal year 1997\u201d);\n\u00a7\u00a713925, 13971 (similar population criteria for funding to\ncombat rural domestic violence); \u00a710136 (specifying rules\napplicable to Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site,\nand providing that \u201c[n]o State, other than the State of\nNevada, may receive financial assistance under this sub\u00ad\nsection after December 22, 1987\u201d). Do such provisions\nremain safe given the Court\u2019s expansion of equal sover\u00ad\neignty\u2019s sway?\n   Of gravest concern, Congress relied on our pathmarking\nKatzenbach decision in each reauthorization of the VRA.\nIt had every reason to believe that the Act\u2019s limited geo\u00ad\ngraphical scope would weigh in favor of, not against, the\nAct\u2019s constitutionality. See, e.g., United States v. Morri-\nson, 529 U. S. 598, 626\u2013627 (2000) (confining preclearance\nregime to States with a record of discrimination bolstered\nthe VRA\u2019s constitutionality). Congress could hardly have\nforeseen that the VRA\u2019s limited geographic reach would\nrender the Act constitutionally suspect. See Persily 195\n(\u201c[S]upporters of the Act sought to develop an evidentiary\nrecord for the principal purpose of explaining why the\ncovered jurisdictions should remain covered, rather than\njustifying the coverage of certain jurisdictions but not\nothers.\u201d).\n   In the Court\u2019s conception, it appears, defenders of the\nVRA could not prevail upon showing what the record\noverwhelmingly bears out, i.e., that there is a need for\ncontinuing the preclearance regime in covered States. In\naddition, the defenders would have to disprove the exist\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n61\u201362 (suggesting that proof of egregious episodes of racial\ndiscrimination in covered jurisdictions would not suffice to\ncarry the day for the VRA, unless such episodes are shown\nto be absent elsewhere). I am aware of no precedent for\nimposing such a double burden on defenders of legislation.\n                              C\n   The Court has time and again declined to upset legisla\u00ad\ntion of this genre unless there was no or almost no evi\u00ad\ndence of unconstitutional action by States. See, e.g., City\nof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 530 (1997) (legislative\nrecord \u201cmention[ed] no episodes [of the kind the legislation\naimed to check] occurring in the past 40 years\u201d). No such\nclaim can be made about the congressional record for the\n2006 VRA reauthorization. Given a record replete with\nexamples of denial or abridgment of a paramount federal\nright, the Court should have left the matter where it\nbelongs: in Congress\u2019 bailiwick.\n   Instead, the Court strikes \u00a74(b)\u2019s coverage provision\nbecause, in its view, the provision is not based on \u201ccurrent\nconditions.\u201d Ante, at 17. It discounts, however, that one\nsuch condition was the preclearance remedy in place in\nthe covered jurisdictions, a remedy Congress designed\nboth to catch discrimination before it causes harm, and to\nguard against return to old ways. 2006 Reauthorization\n\u00a72(b)(3), (9). Volumes of evidence supported Congress\u2019 de\u00ad\ntermination that the prospect of retrogression was real.\nThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is\ncontinuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like\nthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you\nare not getting wet.\n   But, the Court insists, the coverage formula is no good;\nit is based on \u201cdecades-old data and eradicated practices.\u201d\nAnte, at 18. Even if the legislative record shows, as engag\u00ad\ning with it would reveal, that the formula accurately\n34               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nidentifies the jurisdictions with the worst conditions of\nvoting discrimination, that is of no moment, as the Court\nsees it. Congress, the Court decrees, must \u201cstar[t] from\nscratch.\u201d Ante, at 23. I do not see why that should be so.\n   Congress\u2019 chore was different in 1965 than it was in\n2006. In 1965, there were a \u201csmall number of States . . .\nwhich in most instances were familiar to Congress by\nname,\u201d on which Congress fixed its attention. Katzenbach,\n383 U. S., at 328. In drafting the coverage formula, \u201cCon\u00ad\ngress began work with reliable evidence of actual voting\ndiscrimination in a great majority of the States\u201d it sought\nto target. Id., at 329. \u201cThe formula [Congress] eventually\nevolved to describe these areas\u201d also captured a few States\nthat had not been the subject of congressional factfinding.\nIbid. Nevertheless, the Court upheld the formula in its\nentirety, finding it fair \u201cto infer a significant danger of the\nevil\u201d in all places the formula covered. Ibid.\n   The situation Congress faced in 2006, when it took up\nreauthorization of the coverage formula, was not the same.\nBy then, the formula had been in effect for many years,\nand all of the jurisdictions covered by it were \u201cfamiliar\nto Congress by name.\u201d Id., at 328. The question before\nCongress: Was there still a sufficient basis to support\ncontinued application of the preclearance remedy in each\nof those already-identified places? There was at that point\nno chance that the formula might inadvertently sweep in\nnew areas that were not the subject of congressional\nfindings. And Congress could determine from the record\nwhether the jurisdictions captured by the coverage for\u00ad\nmula still belonged under the preclearance regime. If they\ndid, there was no need to alter the formula. That is why\nthe Court, in addressing prior reauthorizations of the\nVRA, did not question the continuing \u201crelevance\u201d of the\nformula.\n   Consider once again the components of the record before\nCongress in 2006. The coverage provision identified a\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            35\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nknown list of places with an undisputed history of serious\nproblems with racial discrimination in voting. Recent\nevidence relating to Alabama and its counties was there\nfor all to see. Multiple Supreme Court decisions had\nupheld the coverage provision, most recently in 1999.\nThere was extensive evidence that, due to the preclear\u00ad\nance mechanism, conditions in the covered jurisdictions\nhad notably improved. And there was evidence that pre\u00ad\nclearance was still having a substantial real-world effect,\nhaving stopped hundreds of discriminatory voting changes\nin the covered jurisdictions since the last reauthorization.\nIn addition, there was evidence that racial polarization in\nvoting was higher in covered jurisdictions than elsewhere,\nincreasing the vulnerability of minority citizens in those\njurisdictions. And countless witnesses, reports, and case\nstudies documented continuing problems with voting dis\u00ad\ncrimination in those jurisdictions. In light of this rec\u00ad\nord, Congress had more than a reasonable basis to\nconclude that the existing coverage formula was not out of\nsync with conditions on the ground in covered areas. And\ncertainly Shelby County was no candidate for release\nthrough the mechanism Congress provided. See supra, at\n22\u201323, 26\u201328.\n   The Court holds \u00a74(b) invalid on the ground that it is\n\u201cirrational to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40\nyears ago, when such tests have been illegal since that\ntime.\u201d Ante, at 23. But the Court disregards what Con\u00ad\ngress set about to do in enacting the VRA. That extraor\u00ad\ndinary legislation scarcely stopped at the particular tests\nand devices that happened to exist in 1965. The grand\naim of the Act is to secure to all in our polity equal citizen\u00ad\nship stature, a voice in our democracy undiluted by race.\nAs the record for the 2006 reauthorization makes abun\u00ad\ndantly clear, second-generation barriers to minority voting\nrights have emerged in the covered jurisdictions as at\u00ad\ntempted substitutes for the first-generation barriers that\n36               SHELBY COUNTY v. HOLDER\n\n                    GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\noriginally triggered preclearance in those jurisdictions.\nSee supra, at 5\u20136, 8, 15\u201317.\n   The sad irony of today\u2019s decision lies in its utter failure\nto grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court\nappears to believe that the VRA\u2019s success in eliminating\nthe specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear\u00ad\nance is no longer needed. Ante, at 21\u201322, 23\u201324. With\nthat belief, and the argument derived from it, history\nrepeats itself. The same assumption\u2014that the problem\ncould be solved when particular methods of voting discrim\u00ad\nination are identified and eliminated\u2014was indulged and\nproved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA\u2019s enactment.\nUnlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or\ndevices, the VRA is grounded in Congress\u2019 recognition of\nthe \u201cvariety and persistence\u201d of measures designed to\nimpair minority voting rights. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at\n311; supra, at 2. In truth, the evolution of voting discrim\u00ad\nination into more subtle second-generation barriers is\npowerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclear\u00ad\nance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and\nprevent backsliding.\n   Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It\nis extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission\nlong delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize\nthe purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nFor a half century, a concerted effort has been made to\nend racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting\nRights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been\nachieved and continues to be made.\n   The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of\nthe VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the\nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee as \u201cone of\nthe most extensive considerations of any piece of legisla\u00ad\ntion that the United States Congress has dealt with in the\n27\u00bd years\u201d he had served in the House. 152 Cong.
