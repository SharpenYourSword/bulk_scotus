JOHNS RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT\n                   DISTRICT\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n    No. 11\u20131447. Argued January 15, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nCoy Koontz, Sr., whose estate is represented here by petitioner, sought\n  permits to develop a section of his property from respondent St.\n  Johns River Water Management District (District), which, consistent\n  with Florida law, requires permit applicants wishing to build on wet-\n  lands to offset the resulting environmental damage. Koontz offered\n  to mitigate the environmental effects of his development proposal by\n  deeding to the District a conservation easement on nearly three-\n  quarters of his property. The District rejected Koontz\u2019s proposal and\n  informed him that it would approve construction only if he (1) re-\n  duced the size of his development and, inter alia, deeded to the Dis-\n  trict a conservation easement on the resulting larger remainder of his\n  property or (2) hired contractors to make improvements to District-\n  owned wetlands several miles away. Believing the District\u2019s de-\n  mands to be excessive in light of the environmental effects his pro-\n  posal would have caused, Koontz filed suit under a state law that\n  provides money damages for agency action that is an \u201cunreasonable\n  exercise of the state\u2019s police power constituting a taking without just\n  compensation.\u201d\n     The trial court found the District\u2019s actions unlawful because they\n  failed the requirements of Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483\n  U. S. 825, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374. Those cases\n  held that the government may not condition the approval of a land-\n  use permit on the owner\u2019s relinquishment of a portion of his property\n  unless there is a nexus and rough proportionality between the gov-\n  ernment\u2019s demand and the effects of the proposed land use. The Dis-\n  trict Court of Appeal affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed\n  on two grounds. First, it held that petitioner\u2019s claim failed because,\n  unlike in Nollan or Dolan, the District denied the application. Se-\n2               KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                     MANAGEMENT DIST.                                    \n\n                             Syllabus\n\n\n    cond, the State Supreme Court held that a demand for money cannot\n    give rise to a claim under Nollan and Dolan.\nHeld:\n    1. The government\u2019s demand for property from a land-use permit\n applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when it\n denies the permit. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) The unconstitutional conditions doctrine vindicates the Con-\n stitution\u2019s enumerated rights by preventing the government from co-\n ercing people into giving them up, and Nollan and Dolan represent a\n special application of this doctrine that protects the Fifth Amend-\n ment right to just compensation for property the government takes\n when owners apply for land-use permits. The standard set out in\n Nollan and Dolan reflects the danger of governmental coercion in this\n context while accommodating the government\u2019s legitimate need to\n offset the public costs of development through land use exactions.\n Dolan, supra, at 391; Nollan, supra, at 837. Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) The principles that undergird Nollan and Dolan do not\n change depending on whether the government approves a permit on\n the condition that the applicant turn over property or denies a permit\n because the applicant refuses to do so. Recognizing such a distinction\n would enable the government to evade the Nollan/Dolan limitations\n simply by phrasing its demands for property as conditions precedent\n to permit approval. This Court\u2019s unconstitutional conditions cases\n have long refused to attach significance to the distinction between\n conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. See, e.g., Frost &\n Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 592\u2013\n 593. It makes no difference that no property was actually taken in\n this case. Extortionate demands for property in the land-use permit-\n ting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because they take\n property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have\n property taken without just compensation. Nor does it matter that\n the District might have been able to deny Koontz\u2019s application out-\n right without giving him the option of securing a permit by agreeing\n to spend money improving public lands. It is settled that the uncon-\n stitutional conditions doctrine applies even when the government\n threatens to withhold a gratuitous benefit. See e.g., United States v.\n American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 210. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (c) The District concedes that the denial of a permit could give\n rise to a valid Nollan/Dolan claim, but urges that this Court should\n not review this particular denial because Koontz sued in the wrong\n court, for the wrong remedy, and at the wrong time. Most of its ar-\n guments raise questions of state law. But to the extent that respond-\n ent alleges a federal obstacle to adjudication of petitioner\u2019s claim, the\n Florida courts can consider respondent\u2019s arguments in the first in-\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstance on remand. Finally, the District errs in arguing that because\nit gave Koontz another avenue to obtain permit approval, this Court\nneed not decide whether its demand for offsite improvements satis-\nfied Nollan and Dolan. Had Koontz been offered at least one alterna-\ntive that satisfied Nollan and Dolan, he would not have been subject-\ned to an unconstitutional condition. But the District\u2019s offer to\napprove a less ambitious project does not obviate the need to apply\nNollan and Dolan to the conditions it imposed on its approval of the\nproject Koontz actually proposed. Pp. 12\u201314.\n   2. The government\u2019s demand for property from a land-use permit\napplicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when its\ndemand is for money. Pp. 14\u201322.\n      (a) Contrary to respondent\u2019s argument, Eastern Enterprises v.\nApfel, 524 U. S. 498, where five Justices concluded that the Takings\nClause does not apply to government-imposed financial obligations\nthat \u201cd[o] not operate upon or alter an identified property interest,\u201d\nid., at 540 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart), does not control here, where the demand for money did burden\nthe ownership of a specific parcel of land. Because of the direct link\nbetween the government\u2019s demand and a specific parcel of real prop-\nerty, this case implicates the central concern of Nollan and Dolan:\nthe risk that the government may deploy its substantial power and\ndiscretion in land-use permitting to pursue governmental ends that\nlack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to the effects of the\nproposed use of the property at issue. Pp. 15\u201318.\n      (b) The District argues that if monetary exactions are subject to\nNollan/Dolan scrutiny, then there will be no principled way of distin-\nguishing impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes. But\nthe District exaggerates both the extent to which that problem is\nunique to the land-use permitting context and the practical difficulty\nof distinguishing between the power to tax and the power to take by\neminent domain. It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]axes and user fees . . .\nare not \u2018takings,\u2019 \u201d Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 538 U. S.\n216, 243, n. 2, yet this Court has repeatedly found takings where the\ngovernment, by confiscating financial obligations, achieved a result\nthat could have been obtained through taxation, e.g., id., at 232.\nPp. 18\u201321.\n      (c) The Court\u2019s holding that monetary exactions are subject to\nscrutiny under Nollan and Dolan will not work a revolution in land\nuse law or unduly limit the discretion of local authorities to imple-\nment sensible land use regulations. The rule that Nollan and Dolan\napply to monetary exactions has been the settled law in some of our\nNation\u2019s most populous States for many years, and the protections of\nthose cases are often redundant with the requirements of state law.\n4                KOONTZ v.

KOONTZ, JR., PETITIONER v. ST. JOHNS \n\n     RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT\n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       FLORIDA\n\n                                 [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Our decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n,\n483 U. S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512\nU. S. 374 (1994), provide important protection against the\nmisuse of the power of land-use regulation. In those cases,\nwe held that a unit of government may not condition the\napproval of a land-use permit on the owner\u2019s relinquish-\nment of a portion of his property unless there is a \u201cnexus\u201d\nand \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the government\u2019s\ndemand and the effects of the proposed land use. In this\ncase, the St. Johns River Water Management District\n(District) believes that it circumvented Nollan and Dolan\nbecause of the way in which it structured its handling of\na permit application submitted by Coy Koontz, Sr., whose\nestate is represented in this Court by Coy Koontz, Jr.1\nThe District did not approve his application on the condi-\ntion that he surrender an interest in his land. Instead, the\nDistrict, after suggesting that he could obtain approval by\nsigning over such an interest, denied his application be-\ncause he refused to yield. The Florida Supreme Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 For   ease of reference, this opinion refers to both men as \u201cpetitioner.\u201d\n2            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nblessed this maneuver and thus effectively interred those\nimportant decisions. Because we conclude that Nollan\nand Dolan cannot be evaded in this way, the Florida Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision must be reversed.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In 1972, petitioner purchased an undeveloped 14.9-acre\ntract of land on the south side of Florida State Road 50, a\ndivided four-lane highway east of Orlando. The property\nis located less than 1,000 feet from that road\u2019s intersection\nwith Florida State Road 408, a tolled expressway that is\none of Orlando\u2019s major thoroughfares.\n   A drainage ditch runs along the property\u2019s western\nedge, and high-voltage power lines bisect it into northern\nand southern sections. The combined effect of the ditch, a\n100-foot wide area kept clear for the power lines, the\nhighways, and other construction on nearby parcels is to\nisolate the northern section of petitioner\u2019s property from\nany other undeveloped land. Although largely classified\nas wetlands by the State, the northern section drains well;\nthe most significant standing water forms in ruts in an\nunpaved road used to access the power lines. The natural\ntopography of the property\u2019s southern section is somewhat\nmore diverse, with a small creek, forested uplands, and\nwetlands that sometimes have water as much as a foot\ndeep. A wildlife survey found evidence of animals that\noften frequent developed areas: raccoons, rabbits, several\nspecies of bird, and a turtle. The record also indicates that\nthe land may be a suitable habitat for opossums.\n   The same year that petitioner purchased his property,\nFlorida enacted the Water Resources Act, which divided\nthe State into five water management districts and au-\nthorized each district to regulate \u201cconstruction that con-\nnects to, draws water from, drains water into, or is placed\nin or across the waters in the state.\u201d 1972 Fla. Laws ch.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n72\u2013299, pt. IV, \u00a71(5), pp. 1115, 1116 (codified as amended\nat Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.403(5) (2010)). Under the Act, a land-\nowner wishing to undertake such construction must obtain\nfrom the relevant district a Management and Storage of\nSurface Water (MSSW) permit, which may impose \u201csuch\nreasonable conditions\u201d on the permit as are \u201cnecessary to\nassure\u201d that construction will \u201cnot be harmful to the water\nresources of the district.\u201d 1972 Fla. Laws \u00a74(1), at 1118\n(codified as amended at Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.413(1)).\n   In 1984, in an effort to protect the State\u2019s rapidly dimin-\nishing wetlands, the Florida Legislature passed the War-\nren S. Henderson Wetlands Protection Act, which made\nit illegal for anyone to \u201cdredge or fill in, on, or over sur-\nface waters\u201d without a Wetlands Resource Management\n(WRM) permit. 1984 Fla. Laws ch. 84\u201379, pt. VIII,\n\u00a7403.905(1), pp. 204\u2013205. Under the Henderson Act,\npermit applicants are required to provide \u201creasonable\nassurance\u201d that proposed construction on wetlands is \u201cnot\ncontrary to the public interest,\u201d as defined by an enumer-\nated list of criteria. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.414(1). Consistent\nwith the Henderson Act, the St. Johns River Water Man-\nagement District, the district with jurisdiction over peti-\ntioner\u2019s land, requires that permit applicants wishing to\nbuild on wetlands offset the resulting environmental\ndamage by creating, enhancing, or preserving wetlands\nelsewhere.\n   Petitioner decided to develop the 3.7-acre northern\nsection of his property, and in 1994 he applied to the\nDistrict for MSSW and WRM permits. Under his pro-\nposal, petitioner would have raised the elevation of the\nnorthernmost section of his land to make it suitable for a\nbuilding, graded the land from the southern edge of the\nbuilding site down to the elevation of the high-voltage\nelectrical lines, and installed a dry-bed pond for retaining\nand gradually releasing stormwater runoff from the build-\ning and its parking lot. To mitigate the environmental\n4            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\neffects of his proposal, petitioner offered to foreclose any\npossible future development of the approximately 11-acre\nsouthern section of his land by deeding to the District a\nconservation easement on that portion of his property.\n   The District considered the 11-acre conservation ease-\nment to be inadequate, and it informed petitioner that it\nwould approve construction only if he agreed to one of two\nconcessions. First, the District proposed that petitioner\nreduce the size of his development to 1 acre and deed to\nthe District a conservation easement on the remaining\n13.9 acres. To reduce the development area, the District\nsuggested that petitioner could eliminate the dry-bed pond\nfrom his proposal and instead install a more costly subsur-\nface stormwater management system beneath the building\nsite. The District also suggested that petitioner install\nretaining walls rather than gradually sloping the land\nfrom the building site down to the elevation of the rest of\nhis property to the south.\n   In the alternative, the District told petitioner that he\ncould proceed with the development as proposed, build-\ning on 3.7 acres and deeding a conservation easement to\nthe government on the remainder of the property, if he\nalso agreed to hire contractors to make improvements to\nDistrict-owned land several miles away. Specifically, peti-\ntioner could pay to replace culverts on one parcel or fill in\nditches on another. Either of those projects would have\nenhanced approximately 50 acres of District-owned wet-\nlands. When the District asks permit applicants to fund\noffsite mitigation work, its policy is never to require any\nparticular offsite project, and it did not do so here. In-\nstead, the District said that it \u201cwould also favorably con-\nsider\u201d alternatives to its suggested offsite mitigation\nprojects if petitioner proposed something \u201cequivalent.\u201d\nApp. 75.\n   Believing the District\u2019s demands for mitigation to be\nexcessive in light of the environmental effects that his\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbuilding proposal would have caused, petitioner filed suit\nin state court. Among other claims, he argued that he was\nentitled to relief under Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.617(2), which allows\nowners to recover \u201cmonetary damages\u201d if a state agency\u2019s\naction is \u201can unreasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police\npower constituting a taking without just compensation.\u201d\n                              B\n   The Florida Circuit Court granted the District\u2019s mo-\ntion to dismiss on the ground that petitioner had not ade-\nquately exhausted his state-administrative remedies, but\nthe Florida District Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit re-\nversed. On remand, the State Circuit Court held a 2-day\nbench trial. After considering testimony from several ex-\nperts who examined petitioner\u2019s property, the trial court\nfound that the property\u2019s northern section had already\nbeen \u201cseriously degraded\u201d by extensive construction on the\nsurrounding parcels. App. to Pet. for Cert. D\u20133. In light\nof this finding and petitioner\u2019s offer to dedicate nearly\nthree-quarters of his land to the District, the trial court\nconcluded that any further mitigation in the form of pay-\nment for offsite improvements to District property lacked\nboth a nexus and rough proportionality to the environ-\nmental impact of the proposed construction. Id., at D\u201311.\nIt accordingly held the District\u2019s actions unlawful under\nour decisions in Nollan and Dolan.\n   The Florida District Court affirmed, 5 So. 3d 8 (2009),\nbut the State Supreme Court reversed, 77 So. 3d 1220\n(2011). A majority of that court distinguished Nollan and\nDolan on two grounds. First, the majority thought it\nsignificant that in this case, unlike Nollan or Dolan,\nthe District did not approve petitioner\u2019s application on\nthe condition that he accede to the District\u2019s demands; in-\nstead, the District denied his application because he re-\nfused to make concessions. 77 So. 3d, at 1230. Second,\nthe majority drew a distinction between a demand for an\n6            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                             \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ninterest in real property (what happened in Nollan and\nDolan) and a demand for money. 77 So. 3d, at 1229\u2013\n1230. The majority acknowledged a division of authority over\nwhether a demand for money can give rise to a claim\nunder Nollan and Dolan, and sided with those courts that\nhave said it cannot. 77 So. 3d, at 1229\u20131230. Compare,\ne.g., McClung v. Sumner, 548 F. 3d 1219, 1228 (CA9 2008),\nwith Ehrlich v. Culver City, 12 Cal. 4th 854, 876, 911 P. 2d\n429, 444 (1996); Flower Mound v. Stafford Estates Ltd.\nPartnership, 135 S. W. 3d 620, 640\u2013641 (Tex. 2004). Two\njustices concurred in the result, arguing that petitioner\nhad failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as re-\nquired by state law before bringing an inverse condem-\nnation suit that challenges the propriety of an agency\naction. 77 So. 3d, at 1231\u20131232; see Key Haven Associated\nEnterprises, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Internal Improve-\nment Trust Fund, 427 So. 2d 153, 159 (Fla. 1982).\n   Recognizing that the majority opinion rested on a ques-\ntion of federal constitutional law on which the lower courts\nare divided, we granted the petition for a writ of certiorari,\n568 U.

S. ____ (2013)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1974), we concluded that a county impermissibly bur-\ndened the right to travel by extending healthcare benefits\nonly to those indigent sick who had been residents of\nthe county for at least one year. Those cases reflect an\noverarching principle, known as the unconstitutional condi-\ntions doctrine, that vindicates the Constitution\u2019s enumer-\nated rights by preventing the government from coercing\npeople into giving them up.\n   Nollan and Dolan \u201cinvolve a special application\u201d of this\ndoctrine that protects the Fifth Amendment right to just\ncompensation for property the government takes when\nowners apply for land-use permits. Lingle v. Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 547 (2005); Dolan, 512 U. S.,\nat 385 (invoking \u201cthe well-settled doctrine of \u2018unconstitu-\ntional conditions\u2019 \u201d). Our decisions in those cases reflect\ntwo realities of the permitting process. The first is that\nland-use permit applicants are especially vulnerable to the\ntype of coercion that the unconstitutional conditions doc-\ntrine prohibits because the government often has broad\ndiscretion to deny a permit that is worth far more than\nproperty it would like to take. By conditioning a building\npermit on the owner\u2019s deeding over a public right-of-\nway, for example, the government can pressure an owner\ninto voluntarily giving up property for which the Fifth\nAmendment would otherwise require just compensation.\nSee id., at 384; Nollan, 483 U. S., at 831. So long as the\nbuilding permit is more valuable than any just compensa-\ntion the owner could hope to receive for the right-of-way,\nthe owner is likely to accede to the government\u2019s demand,\nno matter how unreasonable. Extortionate demands of\nthis sort frustrate the Fifth Amendment right to just\ncompensation, and the unconstitutional conditions doc-\ntrine prohibits them.\n   A second reality of the permitting process is that many\nproposed land uses threaten to impose costs on the public\nthat dedications of property can offset. Where a building\n8           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nproposal would substantially increase traffic congestion,\nfor example, officials might condition permit approval on\nthe owner\u2019s agreement to deed over the land needed to\nwiden a public road. Respondent argues that a similar\nrationale justifies the exaction at issue here: petitioner\u2019s\nproposed construction project, it submits, would destroy\nwetlands on his property, and in order to compensate\nfor this loss, respondent demands that he enhance wet-\nlands elsewhere. Insisting that landowners internalize the\nnegative externalities of their conduct is a hallmark of\nresponsible land-use policy, and we have long sustained\nsuch regulations against constitutional attack. See Vil-\nlage of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926).\n   Nollan and Dolan accommodate both realities by allow-\ning the government to condition approval of a permit on\nthe dedication of property to the public so long as there is\na \u201cnexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the prop-\nerty that the government demands and the social costs of\nthe applicant\u2019s proposal. Dolan, supra, at 391; Nollan, 483\nU. S., at 837. Our precedents thus enable permitting\nauthorities to insist that applicants bear the full costs of\ntheir proposals while still forbidding the government from\nengaging in \u201cout-and-out . . . extortion\u201d that would thwart\nthe Fifth Amendment right to just compensation. Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under Nollan and\nDolan the government may choose whether and how a per-\nmit applicant is required to mitigate the impacts of a\nproposed development, but it may not leverage its legiti-\nmate interest in mitigation to pursue governmental ends\nthat lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to\nthose impacts.\n                          B\n  The principles that undergird our decisions in Nollan\nand Dolan do not change depending on whether the gov-\nernment approves a permit on the condition that the ap-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

We have often concluded\nthat denials of governmental benefits were impermissible\nunder the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. See, e.g.,\nPerry, 408 U. S., at 597 (explaining that the government\n\u201cmay not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that in-\nfringes his constitutionally protected interests\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Memorial Hospital, 415 U. S. 250 (finding uncon-\nstitutional condition where government denied healthcare\nbenefits). In so holding, we have recognized that regard-\nless of whether the government ultimately succeeds in\npressuring someone into forfeiting a constitutional right,\nthe unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids burdening\nthe Constitution\u2019s enumerated rights by coercively with-\nholding benefits from those who exercise them.\n   A contrary rule would be especially untenable in this\ncase because it would enable the government to evade the\nlimitations of Nollan and Dolan simply by phrasing its\ndemands for property as conditions precedent to permit\napproval. Under the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s approach, a\ngovernment order stating that a permit is \u201capproved if \u201d\nthe owner turns over property would be subject to Nollan\nand Dolan, but an identical order that uses the words\n\u201cdenied until\u201d would not. Our unconstitutional condi-\ntions cases have long refused to attach significance to the\ndistinction between conditions precedent and conditions\nsubsequent. See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 592\u2013593 (1926) (invalidat-\ning regulation that required the petitioner to give up a\nconstitutional right \u201cas a condition precedent to the en-\njoyment of a privilege\u201d); Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton,\n146 U. S. 202, 207 (1892) (invalidating statute \u201crequiring\nthe corporation, as a condition precedent to obtaining a per-\nmit to do business within the State, to surrender a right\nand privilege secured to it by the Constitution\u201d). See\nalso Flower Mound, 135 S. W. 3d, at 639 (\u201cThe government\n10           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                            \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncannot sidestep constitutional protections merely by re-\nphrasing its decision from \u2018only if \u2019 to \u2018not unless\u2019 \u201d). To do\nso here would effectively render Nollan and Dolan a dead\nletter.\n   The Florida Supreme Court puzzled over how the gov-\nernment\u2019s demand for property can violate the Takings\nClause even though \u201c \u2018no property of any kind was ever\ntaken,\u2019 \u201d 77 So. 3d, at 1225 (quoting 5 So. 3d, at 20 (Griffin,\nJ., dissenting)); see also 77 So. 3d, at 1229\u20131230, but the\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine provides a ready\nanswer. Extortionate demands for property in the land-\nuse permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not\nbecause they take property but because they impermis-\nsibly burden the right not to have property taken without\njust compensation. As in other unconstitutional condi-\ntions cases in which someone refuses to cede a constitutional\nright in the face of coercive pressure, the impermissible\ndenial of a governmental benefit is a constitutionally cog-\nnizable injury.\n   Nor does it make a difference, as respondent suggests,\nthat the government might have been able to deny peti-\ntioner\u2019s application outright without giving him the option\nof securing a permit by agreeing to spend money to im-\nprove public lands. See Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New\nYork City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978). Virtually all of our uncon-\nstitutional conditions cases involve a gratuitous govern-\nmental benefit of some kind. See, e.g., Regan, 461 U. S.\n540 (tax benefits); Memorial Hospital, 415 U. S. 250\n(healthcare); Perry, 408 U. S. 593 (public employment);\nUnited States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 71 (1936) (crop pay-\nments); Frost, supra (business license). Yet we have re-\npeatedly rejected the argument that if the government\nneed not confer a benefit at all, it can withhold the benefit\nbecause someone refuses to give up constitutional rights.\nE.g., United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539\nU. S. 194, 210 (2003) (\u201c[T]he government may not deny a\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Updegraff, 344\nU. S. 183, 191 (1952) (explaining in unconstitutional con-\nditions case that to focus on \u201cthe facile generalization that\nthere is no constitutionally protected right to public em-\nployment is to obscure the issue\u201d). Even if respondent\nwould have been entirely within its rights in denying the\npermit for some other reason, that greater authority does\nnot imply a lesser power to condition permit approval on\npetitioner\u2019s forfeiture of his constitutional rights. See\nNollan, 483 U. S., at 836\u2013837 (explaining that \u201c[t]he evi-\ndent constitutional propriety\u201d of prohibiting a land use\n\u201cdisappears . . . if the condition substituted for the prohibi-\ntion utterly fails to further the end advanced as the justifi-\ncation for the prohibition\u201d).\n   That is not to say, however, that there is no relevant\ndifference between a consummated taking and the denial\nof a permit based on an unconstitutionally extortionate\ndemand. Where the permit is denied and the condition\nis never imposed, nothing has been taken. While the un-\nconstitutional conditions doctrine recognizes that this\nburdens a constitutional right, the Fifth Amendment man-\ndates a particular remedy\u2014just compensation\u2014only for\ntakings. In cases where there is an excessive demand but\nno taking, whether money damages are available is not a\nquestion of federal constitutional law but of the cause of\naction\u2014whether state or federal\u2014on which the landowner\nrelies. Because petitioner brought his claim pursuant to\na state law cause of action, the Court has no occasion\nto discuss what remedies might be available for a\nNollan/Dolan unconstitutional conditions violation either\nhere or in other cases.\n12          KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n   At oral argument, respondent conceded that the denial\nof a permit could give rise to a valid claim under Nollan\nand Dolan, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201334, but it urged that we\nshould not review the particular denial at issue here\nbecause petitioner sued in the wrong court, for the wrong\nremedy, and at the wrong time. Most of respondent\u2019s\nobjections to the posture of this case raise questions of\nFlorida procedure that are not ours to decide. See Mul-\nlaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975); Murdock v.\nMemphis, 20 Wall. 590, 626 (1875). But to the extent that\nrespondent suggests that the posture of this case creates\nsome federal obstacle to adjudicating petitioner\u2019s unconsti-\ntutional conditions claim, we remand for the Florida\ncourts to consider that argument in the first instance.\n   Respondent argues that we should affirm because,\nrather than suing for damages in the Florida trial court as\nauthorized by Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.617, petitioner should have\nfirst sought judicial review of the denial of his permit in\nthe Florida appellate court under the State\u2019s Administra-\ntive Procedure Act, see \u00a7\u00a7120.68(1), (2) (2010). The Flor-\nida Supreme Court has said that the appellate court is\nthe \u201cproper forum to resolve\u201d a \u201cclaim that an agency has\napplied a . . . statute or rule in such a way that the ag-\ngrieved party\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated,\u201d\nKey Haven Associated Enterprises, 427 So. 2d, at 158, and\nrespondent has argued throughout this litigation that\npetitioner brought his unconstitutional conditions claim in\nthe wrong forum. Two members of the Florida Supreme\nCourt credited respondent\u2019s argument, 77 So. 3d, at 1231\u2013\n1232, but four others refused to address it. We decline\nrespondent\u2019s invitation to second-guess a State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s treatment of its own procedural law.\n   Respondent also contends that we should affirm because\npetitioner sued for damages but is at most entitled to an\ninjunction ordering that his permit issue without any\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconditions. But we need not decide whether federal law\nauthorizes plaintiffs to recover damages for unconstitu-\ntional conditions claims predicated on the Takings Clause\nbecause petitioner brought his claim under state law.\nFlorida law allows property owners to sue for \u201cdamages\u201d\nwhenever a state agency\u2019s action is \u201can unreasonable ex-\nercise of the state\u2019s police power constituting a taking\nwithout just compensation.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7373.617.\nWhether that provision covers an unconstitutional condi-\ntions claim like the one at issue here is a question of state\nlaw that the Florida Supreme Court did not address and\non which we will not opine.\n   For similar reasons, we decline to reach respondent\u2019s\nargument that its demands for property were too indefi-\nnite to give rise to liability under Nollan and Dolan. The\nFlorida Supreme Court did not reach the question whether\nrespondent issued a demand of sufficient concreteness to\ntrigger the special protections of Nollan and Dolan. It\nrelied instead on the Florida District Court of Appeals\u2019\ncharacterization of respondent\u2019s behavior as a demand for\nNollan/Dolan purposes. See 77 So. 3d, at 1224 (quoting 5\nSo. 3d, at 10). Whether that characterization is correct is\nbeyond the scope of the questions the Court agreed to take\nup for review. If preserved, the issue remains open on\nremand for the Florida Supreme Court to address. This\nCourt therefore has no occasion to consider how concrete\nand specific a demand must be to give rise to liability un-\nder Nollan and Dolan.\n   Finally, respondent argues that we need not decide\nwhether its demand for offsite improvements satisfied\nNollan and Dolan because it gave petitioner another\navenue for obtaining permit approval. Specifically, re-\nspondent said that it would have approved a revised per-\nmit application that reduced the footprint of petitioner\u2019s\nproposed construction site from 3.7 acres to 1 acre and\nplaced a conservation easement on the remaining 13.9\n14           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                          \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nacres of petitioner\u2019s land. Respondent argues that regard-\nless of whether its demands for offsite mitigation satisfied\nNollan and Dolan, we must separately consider each of\npetitioner\u2019s options, one of which did not require any of the\noffsite work the trial court found objectionable.\n  Respondent\u2019s argument is flawed because the option to\nwhich it points\u2014developing only 1 acre of the site and\ngranting a conservation easement on the rest\u2014involves\nthe same issue as the option to build on 3.7 acres and\nperform offsite mitigation. We agree with respondent\nthat, so long as a permitting authority offers the landowner\nat least one alternative that would satisfy Nollan and\nDolan, the landowner has not been subjected to an uncon-\nstitutional condition. But respondent\u2019s suggestion that we\nshould treat its offer to let petitioner build on 1 acre as\nan alternative to offsite mitigation misapprehends the gov-\nernmental benefit that petitioner was denied. Petitioner\nsought to develop 3.7 acres, but respondent in effect told\npetitioner that it would not allow him to build on 2.7 of\nthose acres unless he agreed to spend money improving\npublic lands. Petitioner claims that he was wrongfully\ndenied a permit to build on those 2.7 acres. For that\nreason, respondent\u2019s offer to approve a less ambitious\nbuilding project does not obviate the need to determine\nwhether the demand for offsite mitigation satisfied Nollan\nand Dolan.\n                            III\n  We turn to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s alternative\nholding that petitioner\u2019s claim fails because respondent\nasked him to spend money rather than give up an ease-\nment on his land. A predicate for any unconstitutional\nconditions claim is that the government could not have\nconstitutionally ordered the person asserting the claim to\ndo what it attempted to pressure that person into doing.\nSee Rumsfeld, 547 U. S., at 59\u201360. For that reason, we\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbegan our analysis in both Nollan and Dolan by observing\nthat if the government had directly seized the easements\nit sought to obtain through the permitting process, it would\nhave committed a per se taking. See Dolan, 512 U. S.,\nat 384; Nollan, 483 U. S., at 831. The Florida Su-\npreme Court held that petitioner\u2019s claim fails at this first\nstep because the subject of the exaction at issue here was\nmoney rather than a more tangible interest in real prop-\nerty. 77 So. 3d, at 1230. Respondent and the dissent take\nthe same position, citing the concurring and dissenting\nopinions in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498\n(1998), for the proposition that an obligation to spend\nmoney can never provide the basis for a takings claim.\nSee post, at 5\u20138 (opinion of KAGAN, J.).\n   We note as an initial matter that if we accepted this\nargument it would be very easy for land-use permitting\nofficials to evade the limitations of Nollan and Dolan.\nBecause the government need only provide a permit appli-\ncant with one alternative that satisfies the nexus and\nrough proportionality standards, a permitting authority\nwishing to exact an easement could simply give the owner\na choice of either surrendering an easement or making a\npayment equal to the easement\u2019s value. Such so-called \u201cin\nlieu of \u201d fees are utterly commonplace, Rosenberg, The\nChanging Culture of American Land Use Regulation:\nPaying for Growth with Impact Fees, 59 S. M. U. L. Rev.\n177, 202\u2013203 (2006), and they are functionally equivalent\nto other types of land use exactions. For that reason and\nthose that follow, we reject respondent\u2019s argument and\nhold that so-called \u201cmonetary exactions\u201d must satisfy the\nnexus and rough proportionality requirements of Nollan\nand Dolan.\n                            A\n  In Eastern Enterprises, supra, the United States retro-\nactively imposed on a former mining company an obliga-\n16           KOONTZ v.

A four-Justice plurality concluded that the\nstatute\u2019s imposition of retroactive financial liability was so\narbitrary that it violated the Takings Clause. Id., at 529\u2013\n537. Although JUSTICE KENNEDY concurred in the result\non due process grounds, he joined four other Justices in\ndissent in arguing that the Takings Clause does not apply\nto government-imposed financial obligations that \u201cd[o] not\noperate upon or alter an identified property interest.\u201d Id.,\nat 540 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart); see id., at 554\u2013556 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe\n\u2018private property\u2019 upon which the [Takings] Clause tradi-\ntionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or\nintellectual property\u201d). Relying on the concurrence and\ndissent in Eastern Enterprises, respondent argues that a\nrequirement that petitioner spend money improving public\nlands could not give rise to a taking.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument rests on a mistaken premise.\nUnlike the financial obligation in Eastern Enterprises, the\ndemand for money at issue here did \u201coperate upon . . . an\nidentified property interest\u201d by directing the owner of a\nparticular piece of property to make a monetary payment.\nId., at 540 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). In this case, unlike\nEastern Enterprises, the monetary obligation burdened\npetitioner\u2019s ownership of a specific parcel of land. In that\nsense, this case bears resemblance to our cases holding\nthat the government must pay just compensation when it\ntakes a lien\u2014a right to receive money that is secured by a\nparticular piece of property. See Armstrong v. United\nStates, 364 U. S. 40, 44\u201349 (1960); Louisville Joint Stock\nLand Bank v. Radford, 295 U. S. 555, 601\u2013602 (1935);\nUnited States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.

As a result, we need\nnot apply Penn Central\u2019s \u201cessentially ad hoc, factual in-\nquir[y],\u201d 438 U. S., at 124, at all, much less extend that\n\u201calready difficult and uncertain rule\u201d to the \u201cvast category\nof cases\u201d in which someone believes that a regulation is\ntoo costly. Eastern Enterprises, 524 U. S., at 542 (opinion\nof KENNEDY, J.). Instead, petitioner\u2019s claim rests on the\nmore limited proposition that when the government com-\nmands the relinquishment of funds linked to a specific,\nidentifiable property interest such as a bank account or\nparcel of real property, a \u201cper se [takings] approach\u201d is the\nproper mode of analysis under the Court\u2019s precedent.\nBrown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 538 U. S. 216, 235\n(2003).\n   Finally, it bears emphasis that petitioner\u2019s claim does\nnot implicate \u201cnormative considerations about the wisdom\nof government decisions.\u201d Eastern Enterprises, 524 U. S.,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Thus, because the proposed offsite mitigation obligation in this case\nwas tied to a particular parcel of land, this case does not implicate the\nquestion whether monetary exactions must be tied to a particular\nparcel of land in order to constitute a taking. That is so even when\nthe demand is considered \u201coutside the permitting process.\u201d Post, at 8\n(KAGAN, J., dissenting). The unconstitutional conditions analysis\nrequires us to set aside petitioner\u2019s permit application, not his owner-\nship of a particular parcel of real property.\n18           KOONTZ v. ST.

Id., at 554 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting). Whatever the wisdom of such a policy, it\nwould transfer an interest in property from the landowner\nto the government. For that reason, any such demand\nwould amount to a per se taking similar to the taking of an\neasement or a lien. Cf. Dolan, 512 U. S., at 384; Nollan,\n483 U. S., at 831.\n                              B\n   Respondent and the dissent argue that if monetary\nexactions are made subject to scrutiny under Nollan and\nDolan, then there will be no principled way of distinguish-\ning impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes.\nSee post, at 9\u201310. We think they exaggerate both the\nextent to which that problem is unique to the land-use\npermitting context and the practical difficulty of distin-\nguishing between the power to tax and the power to take\nby eminent domain.\n   It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]axes and user fees . . . are\nnot \u2018takings.\u2019 \u201d Brown, supra, at 243, n. 2 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). We said as much in County of Mobile v. Kim-\nball, 102 U. S. 691, 703 (1881), and our cases have been\nclear on that point ever since. United States v. Sperry\nCorp., 493 U. S. 52, 62, n. 9 (1989); see A. Magnano Co. v.\nHamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44 (1934); Dane v. Jackson, 256\nU. S. 589, 599 (1921); Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson\nCity, 173 U. S. 592, 614\u2013615 (1899). This case therefore\ndoes not affect the ability of governments to impose prop-\nerty taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations\nthat may impose financial burdens on property owners.\n   At the same time, we have repeatedly found takings\nwhere the government, by confiscating financial obliga-\ntions, achieved a result that could have been obtained by\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposing a tax. Most recently, in Brown, supra, at 232,\nwe were unanimous in concluding that a State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s seizure of the interest on client funds held in\nescrow was a taking despite the unquestionable constitu-\ntional propriety of a tax that would have raised exactly the\nsame revenue. Our holding in Brown followed from Phil-\nlips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156 (1998),\nand Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449\nU. S. 155 (1980), two earlier cases in which we treated\nconfiscations of money as takings despite their functional\nsimilarity to a tax. Perhaps most closely analogous to the\npresent case, we have repeatedly held that the govern-\nment takes property when it seizes liens, and in so ruling\nwe have never considered whether the government could\nhave achieved an economically equivalent result through\ntaxation. Armstrong, 364 U. S. 40; Louisville Joint Stock\nLand Bank, 295 U. S. 555.\n   Two facts emerge from those cases. The first is that the\nneed to distinguish taxes from takings is not a creature of\nour holding today that monetary exactions are subject to\nscrutiny under Nollan and Dolan. Rather, the problem is\ninherent in this Court\u2019s long-settled view that property\nthe government could constitutionally demand through its\ntaxing power can also be taken by eminent domain.\n   Second, our cases show that teasing out the difference\nbetween taxes and takings is more difficult in theory than\nin practice. Brown is illustrative. Similar to respondent\nin this case, the respondents in Brown argued that extend-\ning the protections of the Takings Clause to a bank\naccount would open a Pandora\u2019s Box of constitutional chal-\nlenges to taxes.

Any such\nargument would have been implausible under state law; in\nWashington, taxes are levied by the legislature, not the\ncourts. See 538 U. S., at 242, n. 2 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   The same dynamic is at work in this case because Flor-\nida law greatly circumscribes respondent\u2019s power to tax.\nSee Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7373.503 (authorizing respondent to\nimpose ad valorem tax on properties within its jurisdic-\ntion); \u00a7373.109 (authorizing respondent to charge permit\napplication fees but providing that such fees \u201cshall not\nexceed the cost . . . for processing, monitoring, and inspect-\ning for compliance with the permit\u201d). If respondent had\nargued that its demand for money was a tax, it would have\neffectively conceded that its denial of petitioner\u2019s permit\nwas improper under Florida law. Far from making that\nconcession, respondent has maintained throughout this\nlitigation that it considered petitioner\u2019s money to be a\nsubstitute for his deeding to the public a conservation\neasement on a larger parcel of undeveloped land.3\n   This case does not require us to say more. We need\nnot decide at precisely what point a land-use permitting\ncharge denominated by the government as a \u201ctax\u201d becomes\n\u201cso arbitrary . . . that it was not the exertion of taxation\nbut a confiscation of property.\u201d Brushaber v. Union Pacific\nR. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1916). For present purposes, it\nsuffices to say that despite having long recognized that\n\u201cthe power of taxation should not be confused with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Citing cases in which state courts have treated similar governmen-\n\ntal demands for money differently, the dissent predicts that courts will\n\u201cstruggle to draw a coherent boundary\u201d between taxes and excessive\ndemands for money that violate Nollan and Dolan. Post, at 9\u201310. But\nthe cases the dissent cites illustrate how the frequent need to decide\nwhether a particular demand for money qualifies as a tax under state\nlaw, and the resulting state statutes and judicial precedents on point,\ngreatly reduce the practical difficulty of resolving the same issue in\nfederal constitutional cases like this one.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Post, at 8. Numerous courts\u2014including\ncourts in many of our Nation\u2019s most populous States\u2014\nhave confronted constitutional challenges to monetary\nexactions over the last two decades and applied the stand-\nard from Nollan and Dolan or something like it. See, e.g.,\nNorthern Ill. Home Builders Assn. v. County of Du Page,\n165 Ill. 2d. 25, 31\u201332, 649 N. E. 2d 384, 388\u2013389 (1995);\nHome Builders Assn. v.

Yet the \u201csignificant practical harm\u201d\nthe dissent predicts has not come to pass. Post, at 8. That\nis hardly surprising, for the dissent is correct that state\nlaw normally provides an independent check on excessive\nland use permitting fees.

In any\nevent, the dissent\u2019s argument that land use permit appli-\ncants need no further protection when the government\ndemands money is really an argument for overruling\nNollan and Dolan.

See Nollan, 483 U. S., at\n838. We have repeatedly rejected the dissent\u2019s contention\nthat other constitutional doctrines leave no room for the\nnexus and rough proportionality requirements of Nollan\nand Dolan.

California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), and\nDolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374 (1994), the govern-\nment approves a building permit on the condition that the\nlandowner relinquish an interest in real property, like an\neasement. The significant legal questions that the Court\nresolves today are whether Nollan and Dolan also apply\nwhen that case is varied in two ways. First, what if the\ngovernment does not approve the permit, but instead\ndemands that the condition be fulfilled before it will do so?\nSecond, what if the condition entails not transferring real\nproperty, but simply paying money? This case also raises\nother, more fact-specific issues I will address: whether the\ngovernment here imposed any condition at all, and whether\npetitioner Coy Koontz suffered any compensable injury.\n   I think the Court gets the first question it addresses\nright. The Nollan-Dolan standard applies not only when\nthe government approves a development permit condi-\ntioned on the owner\u2019s conveyance of a property interest\n(i.e., imposes a condition subsequent), but also when the\ngovernment denies a permit until the owner meets the\ncondition (i.e., imposes a condition precedent). That\n2           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                  KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeans an owner may challenge the denial of a permit on\nthe ground that the government\u2019s condition lacks the\n\u201cnexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d to the development\u2019s\nsocial costs that Nollan and Dolan require. Still, the\ncondition-subsequent and condition-precedent situations\ndiffer in an important way. When the government grants\na permit subject to the relinquishment of real property,\nand that condition does not satisfy Nollan and Dolan, then\nthe government has taken the property and must pay just\ncompensation under the Fifth Amendment. But when the\ngovernment denies a permit because an owner has refused\nto accede to that same demand, nothing has actually been\ntaken. The owner is entitled to have the improper condi-\ntion removed; and he may be entitled to a monetary remedy\ncreated by state law for imposing such a condition; but\nhe cannot be entitled to constitutional compensation for a\ntaking of property. So far, we all agree.\n   Our core disagreement concerns the second question the\nCourt addresses. The majority extends Nollan and Dolan\nto cases in which the government conditions a permit not\non the transfer of real property, but instead on the pay-\nment or expenditure of money. That runs roughshod over\nEastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498 (1998), which\nheld that the government may impose ordinary financial\nobligations without triggering the Takings Clause\u2019s pro-\ntections. The boundaries of the majority\u2019s new rule are\nuncertain. But it threatens to subject a vast array of\nland-use regulations, applied daily in States and localities\nthroughout the country, to heightened constitutional\nscrutiny. I would not embark on so unwise an adventure,\nand would affirm the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n   I also would affirm for two independent reasons estab-\nlishing that Koontz cannot get the money damages he\nseeks. First, respondent St. Johns River Water Manage-\nment District (District) never demanded anything (includ-\ning money) in exchange for a permit; the Nollan-Dolan\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nstandard therefore does not come into play (even assuming\nthat test applies to demands for money). Second, no tak-\ning occurred in this case because Koontz never acceded to\na demand (even had there been one), and so no property\nchanged hands; as just noted, Koontz therefore cannot\nclaim just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The\nmajority does not take issue with my first conclusion, and\naffirmatively agrees with my second. But the majority\nthinks Koontz might still be entitled to money damages,\nand remands to the Florida Supreme Court on that ques-\ntion. I do not see how, and expect that court will so rule.\n                             I\n   Claims that government regulations violate the Takings\nClause by unduly restricting the use of property are gen-\nerally \u201cgoverned by the standards set forth in Penn Cen-\ntral Transp.

Id., at 547. Nollan and Dolan prevent the govern-\nment from exploiting the landowner\u2019s permit application\nto evade the constitutional obligation to pay for the prop-\nerty. They do so, as the majority explains, by subjecting\nthe government\u2019s demand to heightened scrutiny: The\ngovernment may condition a land-use permit on the relin-\nquishment of real property only if it shows a \u201cnexus\u201d and\n\u201crough proportionality\u201d between the demand made and\n\u201cthe impact of the proposed development.\u201d Dolan, 512\nU. S., at 386, 391; see ante, at 8. Nollan and Dolan thus\nserve not to address excessive regulatory burdens on land\nuse (the function of Penn Central), but instead to stop the\ngovernment from imposing an \u201cunconstitutional condition\u201d\u2014\na requirement that a person give up his constitutional\nright to receive just compensation \u201cin exchange for a dis-\ncretionary benefit\u201d having \u201clittle or no relationship\u201d to the\nproperty taken. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 547.\n   Accordingly, the Nollan-Dolan test applies only when\nthe property the government demands during the permit-\nting process is the kind it otherwise would have to pay\nfor\u2014or, put differently, when the appropriation of that\nproperty, outside the permitting process, would constitute\na taking. That is why Nollan began by stating that \u201c[h]ad\nCalifornia simply required the Nollans to make an ease-\nment across their beachfront available to the public . . . ,\nrather than conditioning their permit to rebuild their\nhouse on their agreeing to do so, we have no doubt there\nwould have been a taking\u201d requiring just compensation.\n483 U. S., at 831. And it is why Dolan started by main-\ntaining that \u201chad the city simply required petitioner to\ndedicate a strip of land . . . for public use, rather than\nconditioning the grant of her permit to [d]evelop her prop-\nerty on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred.\u201d\n512 U.

Only if that is true could the\ngovernment\u2019s demand for the property force a landowner\nto relinquish his constitutional right to just compensation.\n   Here, Koontz claims that the District demanded that he\nspend money to improve public wetlands, not that he hand\nover a real property interest. I assume for now that the\nDistrict made that demand (although I think it did not,\nsee infra, at 12\u201316.) The key question then is: Independ-\nent of the permitting process, does requiring a person to\npay money to the government, or spend money on its\nbehalf, constitute a taking requiring just compensation?\nOnly if the answer is yes does the Nollan-Dolan test apply.\n   But we have already answered that question no. East-\nern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, as the Court de-\nscribes, involved a federal statute requiring a former\nmining company to pay a large sum of money for the\nhealth benefits of retired employees. Five Members of the\nCourt determined that the law did not effect a taking,\ndistinguishing between the appropriation of a specific\nproperty interest and the imposition of an order to pay\nmoney. JUSTICE KENNEDY acknowledged in his control-\nling opinion that the statute \u201cimpose[d] a staggering fi-\nnancial burden\u201d (which influenced his conclusion that it\nviolated due process). Id., at 540 (opinion concurring in\njudgment and dissenting in part). Still, JUSTICE KENNEDY\nexplained, the law did not effect a taking because it did\nnot \u201coperate upon or alter\u201d a \u201cspecific and identified prop-\nert[y] or property right[ ].\u201d Id., at 540\u2013541. Instead, \u201c[t]he\nlaw simply imposes an obligation to perform an act, the\npayment of benefits. The statute is indifferent as to how\nthe regulated entity elects to comply or the property it\nuses to do so.\u201d Id., at 540. JUSTICE BREYER, writing for\n6            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                            \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nfour more Justices, agreed. He stated that the Takings\nClause applies only when the government appropriates a\n\u201cspecific interest in physical or intellectual property\u201d or \u201ca\nspecific, separately identifiable fund of money\u201d; by con-\ntrast, the Clause has no bearing when the government\nimposes \u201can ordinary liability to pay money.\u201d Id., at 554\u2013\n555 (dissenting opinion).\n   Thus, a requirement that a person pay money to repair\npublic wetlands is not a taking. Such an order does not\naffect a \u201cspecific and identified propert[y] or property\nright[ ]\u201d; it simply \u201cimposes an obligation to perform an\nact\u201d (the improvement of wetlands) that costs money. Id.,\nat 540\u2013541 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). To be sure, when a\nperson spends money on the government\u2019s behalf, or pays\nmoney directly to the government, it \u201cwill reduce [his] net\nworth\u201d\u2014but that \u201ccan be said of any law which has an\nadverse economic effect\u201d on someone. Id., at 543. Because\nthe government is merely imposing a \u201cgeneral liability\u201d\nto pay money, id., at 555 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\u2014and\ntherefore is \u201cindifferent as to how the regulated entity\nelects to comply or the property it uses to do so,\u201d id., at 540\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\u2014the order to repair wetlands,\nviewed independent of the permitting process, does not\nconstitute a taking. And that means the order does not\ntrigger the Nollan-Dolan test, because it does not force\nKoontz to relinquish a constitutional right.\n   The majority tries to distinguish Apfel by asserting that\nthe District\u2019s demand here was \u201cclosely analogous\u201d (and\n\u201cbears resemblance\u201d) to the seizure of a lien on property or\nan income stream from a parcel of land. Ante, at 16, 19.\nThe majority thus seeks support from decisions like Arm-\nstrong v. United States, 364 U. S. 40 (1960), where this\nCourt held that the government effected a taking when it\nextinguished a lien on several ships, and Palm Beach Cty.\nv. Cove Club Investors Ltd., 734 So. 2d 379 (1999), where\nthe Florida Supreme Court held that the government\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

When the government dissolves a\nlien, or appropriates a determinate income stream from a\npiece of property\u2014or, for that matter, seizes a particular\n\u201cbank account or [the] accrued interest\u201d on it\u2014the gov-\nernment indeed takes a \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cidentified prop-\nerty interest.\u201d Apfel, 524 U. S., at 540\u2013541 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). But nothing like that occurred here. The\nDistrict did not demand any particular lien, or bank ac-\ncount, or income stream from property. It just ordered\nKoontz to spend or pay money (again, assuming it ordered\nanything at all). Koontz\u2019s liability would have been the\nsame whether his property produced income or not\u2014e.g.,\neven if all he wanted to build was a family home. And\nsimilarly, Koontz could meet that obligation from what-\never source he chose\u2014a checking account, shares of stock, a\nwealthy uncle; the District was \u201cindifferent as to how [he]\nelect[ed] to [pay] or the property [he] use[d] to do so.\u201d Id.,\nat 540. No more than in Apfel, then, was the (supposed)\ndemand here for a \u201cspecific and identified\u201d piece of property,\nwhich the government could not take without paying for\nit. Id., at 541.\n   The majority thus falls back on the sole way the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s alleged demand related to a property interest: The\ndemand arose out of the permitting process for Koontz\u2019s\nland. See ante, at 16\u201317. But under the analytic frame-\nwork that Nollan and Dolan established, that connection\nalone is insufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. As I\nhave described, the heightened standard of Nollan and\nDolan is not a freestanding protection for land-use permit\napplicants; rather, it is \u201ca special application of the doc-\ntrine of unconstitutional conditions, which provides that\nthe government may not require a person to give up a\n8               KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                     MANAGEMENT DIST.                                         \n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nconstitutional right\u2014here the right to receive just com-\npensation when property is taken\u201d\u2014in exchange for a\nland-use permit. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 547 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted); see supra, at 3\u20135. As such, Nollan\nand Dolan apply only if the demand at issue would have\nviolated the Constitution independent of that proposed\nexchange. Or put otherwise, those cases apply only if the\ndemand would have constituted a taking when executed\noutside the permitting process. And here, under Apfel, it\nwould not.1\n   The majority\u2019s approach, on top of its analytic flaws,\nthreatens significant practical harm. By applying Nollan\nand Dolan to permit conditions requiring monetary\npayments\u2014with no express limitation except as to taxes\u2014\nthe majority extends the Takings Clause, with its notoriously\n\u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cperplexing\u201d standards, into the very heart\nof local land-use regulation and service delivery. 524\nU. S., at 541. Cities and towns across the nation impose\nmany kinds of permitting fees every day. Some enable a\ngovernment to mitigate a new development\u2019s impact on\nthe community, like increased traffic or pollution\u2014or\ndestruction of wetlands. See, e.g., Olympia v. Drebick, 156\nWash. 2d 289, 305, 126 P. 3d 802, 809 (2006). Others\ncover the direct costs of providing services like sewage or\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The majority\u2019s sole response is that \u201cthe unconstitutional conditions\n\nanalysis requires us to set aside petitioner\u2019s permit application, not his\nownership of a particular parcel of real property.\u201d Ante, at 17, n. 1.\nThat mysterious sentence fails to make the majority\u2019s opinion cohere\nwith the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, as anyone has ever\nknown it. That doctrine applies only if imposing a condition directly\u2014\ni.e., independent of an exchange for a government benefit\u2014would\nviolate the Constitution. Here, Apfel makes clear that the District\u2019s\ncondition would not do so: The government may (separate and apart\nfrom permitting) require a person\u2014whether Koontz or anyone else\u2014to\npay or spend money without effecting a taking. The majority offers no\ntheory to the contrary: It does not explain, as it must, why the District\u2019s\ncondition was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nwater to the development. See, e.g., Krupp v. Brecken-\nridge Sanitation Dist., 19 P. 3d 687, 691 (Colo. 2001). Still\nothers are meant to limit the number of landowners who\nengage in a certain activity, as fees for liquor licenses do.\nSee, e.g., Phillips v. Mobile, 208 U. S. 472, 479 (1908);\nBHA Investments, Inc. v. Idaho, 138 Idaho 348, 63 P. 3d\n474 (2003). All now must meet Nollan and Dolan\u2019s nexus\nand proportionality tests. The Federal Constitution thus\nwill decide whether one town is overcharging for sewage,\nor another is setting the price to sell liquor too high. And\nthe flexibility of state and local governments to take the\nmost routine actions to enhance their communities will\ndiminish accordingly.\n   That problem becomes still worse because the majority\u2019s\ndistinction between monetary \u201cexactions\u201d and taxes is so\nhard to apply. Ante, at 18. The majority acknowledges, as\nit must, that taxes are not takings. See ibid. (This case\n\u201cdoes not affect the ability of governments to impose prop-\nerty taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations\nthat may impose financial burdens on property owners\u201d).\nBut once the majority decides that a simple demand to pay\nmoney\u2014the sort of thing often viewed as a tax\u2014can count\nas an impermissible \u201cexaction,\u201d how is anyone to tell the\ntwo apart? The question, as JUSTICE BREYER\u2019s opinion\nin Apfel noted, \u201cbristles with conceptual difficulties.\u201d 524\nU. S., at 556. And practical ones, too: How to separate\norders to pay money from . . . well, orders to pay money, so\nthat a locality knows what it can (and cannot) do. State\ncourts sometimes must confront the same question, as\nthey enforce restrictions on localities\u2019 taxing power. And\ntheir decisions\u2014contrary to the majority\u2019s blithe assertion,\nsee ante, at 20\u201321\u2014struggle to draw a coherent boundary.\nBecause \u201c[t]here is no set rule\u201d by which to determine \u201cin\nwhich category a particular\u201d action belongs, Eastern Di-\nversified Properties, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty., 319 Md. 45,\n53, 570 A. 2d 850, 854 (1990), courts often reach opposite\n10             KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                    MANAGEMENT DIST.                                        \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nconclusions about classifying nearly identical fees. Com-\npare, e.g., Coulter v. Rawlins, 662 P. 2d 888, 901\u2013904\n(Wyo. 1983) (holding that a fee to enhance parks, imposed\nas a permit condition, was a regulatory exaction), with\nHome Builders Assn. v. West Des Moines, 644 N. W. 2d\n339, 350 (Iowa 2002) (rejecting Coulter and holding that a\nnearly identical fee was a tax).2 Nor does the majority\u2019s\nopinion provide any help with that issue: Perhaps its most\nstriking feature is its refusal to say even a word about how\nto make the distinction that will now determine whether a\ngiven fee is subject to heightened scrutiny.\n   Perhaps the Court means in the future to curb the\nintrusion into local affairs that its holding will accomplish;\nthe Court claims, after all, that its opinion is intended to\nhave only limited impact on localities\u2019 land-use authority.\nSee ante, at 8, 21. The majority might, for example, ap-\nprove the rule, adopted in several States, that Nollan and\nDolan apply only to permitting fees that are imposed\nad hoc, and not to fees that are generally applicable. See,\ne.g., Ehrlich v. Culver City, 12 Cal. 4th 854, 911 P. 2d 429\n(1996). Dolan itself suggested that limitation by under-\nscoring that there \u201cthe city made an adjudicative decision\nto condition petitioner\u2019s application for a building permit\non an individual parcel,\u201d instead of imposing an \u201cessen-\ntially legislative determination[] classifying entire areas of\nthe city.\u201d 512 U. S., at 385. Maybe today\u2019s majority ac-\ncepts that distinction; or then again, maybe not. At the\nleast, the majority\u2019s refusal \u201cto say more\u201d about the scope\nof its new rule now casts a cloud on every decision by\nevery local government to require a person seeking a\npermit to pay or spend money. Ante, at 20.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The majority argues that existing state-court precedent will \u201cgreatly\n\nreduce the practical difficulty\u201d of developing a uniform standard for\ndistinguishing taxes from monetary exactions in federal constitutional\ncases. Ante, at 20, n.2. But how are those decisions to perform that\nfeat if they themselves are all over the map?\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                11\n\n                        KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\n   At bottom, the majority\u2019s analysis seems to grow out of a\nyen for a prophylactic rule: Unless Nollan and Dolan\napply to monetary demands, the majority worries, \u201cland-\nuse permitting officials\u201d could easily \u201cevade the limita-\ntions\u201d on exaction of real property interests that those\ndecisions impose. Ante, at 15. But that is a prophylaxis in\nsearch of a problem. No one has presented evidence that\nin the many States declining to apply heightened scrutiny\nto permitting fees, local officials routinely short-circuit\nNollan and Dolan to extort the surrender of real property\ninterests having no relation to a development\u2019s costs. See,\ne.g., Krupp v. Breckenridge Sanitation Dist., 19 P. 3d, at\n697; Home Builders Assn. of Central Arizona v. Scottsdale,\n187 Ariz. 479, 486, 930 P. 2d 993, 1000 (1997); McCarthy\nv. Leawood, 257 Kan. 566, 579, 894 P. 2d 836, 845 (1995).\nAnd if officials were to impose a fee as a contrivance to\ntake an easement (or other real property right), then a\ncourt could indeed apply Nollan and Dolan. See, e.g.,\nNorwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269 (1898) (preventing cir-\ncumvention of the Takings Clause by prohibiting the\ngovernment from imposing a special assessment for the\nfull value of a property in advance of condemning it). That\nsituation does not call for a rule extending, as the majori-\nty\u2019s does, to all monetary exactions. Finally, a court can\nuse the Penn Central framework, the Due Process Clause,\nand (in many places) state law to protect against monetary\ndemands, whether or not imposed to evade Nollan and\nDolan, that simply \u201cgo[ ] too far.\u201d Mahon, 260 U. S., at\n415; see supra, at 3.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Our Penn Central test protects against regulations that unduly\n\nburden an owner\u2019s use of his property: Unlike the Nollan-Dolan stand-\nard, that framework fits to a T a complaint (like Koontz\u2019s) that a\npermitting condition makes it inordinately expensive to develop land.\nAnd the Due Process Clause provides an additional backstop against\nexcessive permitting fees by preventing a government from condition-\ning a land-use permit on a monetary requirement that is \u201cbasically\n12             KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                    MANAGEMENT DIST.                                    \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\n   In sum, Nollan and Dolan restrain governments from\nusing the permitting process to do what the Takings\nClause would otherwise prevent\u2014i.e., take a specific\nproperty interest without just compensation. Those cases\nhave no application when governments impose a general\nfinancial obligation as part of the permitting process,\nbecause under Apfel such an action does not otherwise\ntrigger the Takings Clause\u2019s protections. By extending\nNollan and Dolan\u2019s heightened scrutiny to a simple pay-\nment demand, the majority threatens the heartland of\nlocal land-use regulation and service delivery, at a bare\nminimum depriving state and local governments of \u201cneces-\nsary predictability.\u201d Apfel, 524 U. S., at 542 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). That decision is unwarranted\u2014and deeply\nunwise. I would keep Nollan and Dolan in their intended\nsphere and affirm the Florida Supreme Court.\n                           II\n  I also would affirm the judgment below for two inde-\npendent reasons, even assuming that a demand for money\ncan trigger Nollan and Dolan. First, the District never\ndemanded that Koontz give up anything (including money)\nas a condition for granting him a permit.4 And second,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narbitrary.\u201d Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 557\u2013558 (1998)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). My point is not, as the majority suggests, that\nthese constraints do the same thing as Nollan and Dolan, and so make\nthose decisions unnecessary. See ante, at 21. To the contrary, Nollan\nand Dolan provide developers with enhanced protection (and localities\nwith correspondingly reduced flexibility). See supra, at 8. The question\nhere has to do not with \u201coverruling\u201d those cases, but with extending\nthem. Ante, at 21. My argument is that our prior caselaw struck the\nright balance: heightened scrutiny when the government uses the\npermitting process to demand property that the Takings Clause pro-\ntects, and lesser scrutiny, but a continuing safeguard against abuse,\nwhen the government\u2019s demand is for something falling outside that\nClause\u2019s scope.\n  4 The Court declines to consider whether the District demanded any-\n\nthing from Koontz because the Florida Supreme Court did not reach the\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nbecause (as everyone agrees) no actual taking occurred,\nKoontz cannot claim just compensation even had the\nDistrict made a demand. The majority nonetheless re-\nmands this case on the theory that Koontz might still be\nentitled to money damages. I cannot see how, and so\nwould spare the Florida courts.\n                              A\n  Nollan and Dolan apply only when the government\nmakes a \u201cdemand[ ]\u201d that a landowner turn over property\nin exchange for a permit. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 546. I\nunderstand the majority to agree with that proposition:\nAfter all, the entire unconstitutional conditions doctrine,\nas the majority notes, rests on the fear that the govern-\nment may use its control over benefits (like permits) to\n\u201ccoerc[e]\u201d a person into giving up a constitutional right.\nAnte, at 7; see ante, at 13. A Nollan-Dolan claim therefore\ndepends on a showing of government coercion, not rele-\nvant in an ordinary challenge to a permit denial. See\nMonterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U. S.\n687, 703 (1999) (Nollan and Dolan were \u201cnot designed to\naddress, and [are] not readily applicable to,\u201d a claim based\non the mere \u201cdenial of [a] development\u201d permit). Before\napplying Nollan and Dolan, a court must find that the\npermit denial occurred because the government made a\ndemand of the landowner, which he rebuffed.\n  And unless Nollan and Dolan are to wreck land-use\npermitting throughout the country\u2014to the detriment of\nboth communities and property owners\u2014that demand\nmust be unequivocal. If a local government risked a law-\nsuit every time it made a suggestion to an applicant about\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nissue. See ante, at 13. But because the District raised this issue in its\nbrief opposing certiorari, Brief in Opposition 14\u201318, both parties briefed\nand argued it on the merits, see Brief for Respondent 37\u201343; Reply\nBrief 7\u20138, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u201312, 27\u201328, 52\u201353, and it provides yet\nanother ground to affirm the judgment below, I address the question.\n14           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nhow to meet permitting criteria, it would cease to do so;\nindeed, the government might desist altogether from\ncommunicating with applicants. That hazard is to some\nextent baked into Nollan and Dolan; observers have won-\ndered whether those decisions have inclined some local\ngovernments to deny permit applications outright, rather\nthan negotiate agreements that could work to both\nsides\u2019 advantage. See W. Fischel, Regulatory Takings 346\n(1995). But that danger would rise exponentially if some-\nthing less than a clear condition\u2014if each idea or proposal\noffered in the back-and-forth of reconciling diverse inter-\nests\u2014triggered Nollan-Dolan scrutiny. At that point,\nno local government official with a decent lawyer would\nhave a conversation with a developer. Hence the need\nto reserve Nollan and Dolan, as we always have, for re-\nviewing only what an official demands, not all he says in\nnegotiations.\n   With that as backdrop, consider how this case arose. To\narrest the loss of the State\u2019s rapidly diminishing wetlands,\nFlorida law prevents landowners from filling or draining\nany such property without two permits. See ante, at 2\u20133.\nKoontz\u2019s property qualifies as a wetland, and he therefore\nneeded the permits to embark on development. His appli-\ncations, however, failed the District\u2019s preliminary review:\nThe District found that they did not preserve wetlands or\nprotect fish and wildlife to the extent Florida law required.\nSee App. Exh. 19\u201320, 47. At that point, the District could\nsimply have denied the applications; had it done so, the\nPenn Central test\u2014not Nollan and Dolan\u2014would have\ngoverned any takings claim Koontz might have brought.\nSee Del Monte Dunes, 526 U. S., at 702\u2013703.\n   Rather than reject the applications, however, the Dis-\ntrict suggested to Koontz ways he could modify them to\nmeet legal requirements. The District proposed reducing\nthe development\u2019s size or modifying its design to lessen\nthe impact on wetlands. See App. Exh. 87\u201388, 91\u201392.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAlternatively, the District raised several options for \u201coff-\nsite mitigation\u201d that Koontz could undertake in a nearby\nnature preserve, thus compensating for the loss of wet-\nlands his project would cause. Id., at 90\u201391. The District\nnever made any particular demand respecting an off-site\nproject (or anything else); as Koontz testified at trial, that\npossibility was presented only in broad strokes, \u201c[n]ot in\nany great detail.\u201d App. 103. And the District made clear\nthat it welcomed additional proposals from Koontz to\nmitigate his project\u2019s damage to wetlands. See id., at 75.\nEven at the final hearing on his applications, the District\nasked Koontz if he would \u201cbe willing to go back with the\nstaff over the next month and renegotiate this thing and\ntry to come up with\u201d a solution. Id., at 37. But Koontz\nrefused, saying (through his lawyer) that the proposal he\nsubmitted was \u201cas good as it can get.\u201d Id., at 41. The\nDistrict therefore denied the applications, consistent with\nits original view that they failed to satisfy Florida law.\n   In short, the District never made a demand or set a\ncondition\u2014not to cede an identifiable property interest,\nnot to undertake a particular mitigation project, not even\nto write a check to the government. Instead, the District\nsuggested to Koontz several non-exclusive ways to make\nhis applications conform to state law. The District\u2019s only\nhard-and-fast requirement was that Koontz do something\u2014\nanything\u2014to satisfy the relevant permitting criteria.\nKoontz\u2019s failure to obtain the permits therefore did not\nresult from his refusal to accede to an allegedly extortionate\ndemand or condition; rather, it arose from the legal deficien-\ncies of his applications, combined with his unwillingness\nto correct them by any means. Nollan and Dolan were\nnever meant to address such a run-of-the-mill denial of a\nland-use permit. As applications of the unconstitutional\nconditions doctrine, those decisions require a condition;\nand here, there was none.\n   Indeed, this case well illustrates the danger of extending\n16           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nNollan and Dolan beyond their proper compass. Consider\nthe matter from the standpoint of the District\u2019s lawyer.\nThe District, she learns, has found that Koontz\u2019s permit\napplications do not satisfy legal requirements. It can\ndeny the permits on that basis; or it can suggest ways for\nKoontz to bring his applications into compliance. If every\nsuggestion could become the subject of a lawsuit under\nNollan and Dolan, the lawyer can give but one recommen-\ndation: Deny the permits, without giving Koontz any\nadvice\u2014even if he asks for guidance. As the Florida Su-\npreme Court observed of this case: Were Nollan and Dolan\nto apply, the District would \u201copt to simply deny permits\noutright without discussion or negotiation rather than risk\nthe crushing costs of litigation\u201d; and property owners\nlike Koontz then would \u201chave no opportunity to amend\ntheir applications or discuss mitigation options.\u201d 77 So. 3d\n1220, 1231 (2011). Nothing in the Takings Clause re-\nquires that folly. I would therefore hold that the District\ndid not impose an unconstitutional condition\u2014because it\ndid not impose a condition at all.\n                               B\n   And finally, a third difficulty: Even if (1) money counted\nas \u201cspecific and identified propert[y]\u201d under Apfel (though\nit doesn\u2019t), and (2) the District made a demand for it\n(though it didn\u2019t), (3) Koontz never paid a cent, so the\nDistrict took nothing from him. As I have explained, that\nthird point does not prevent Koontz from suing to invali-\ndate the purported demand as an unconstitutional condi-\ntion. See supra, at 1\u20132. But it does mean, as the majority\nagrees, that Koontz is not entitled to just compensation\nunder the Takings Clause. See ante, at 11. He may obtain\nmonetary relief under the Florida statute he invoked only\nif it authorizes damages beyond just compensation for a\ntaking.\n   The majority remands that question to the Florida\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nSupreme Court, and given how it disposes of the other\nissues here, I can understand why. As the majority indi-\ncates, a State could decide to create a damages remedy not\nonly for a taking, but also for an unconstitutional condi-\ntions claim predicated on the Takings Clause. And that\nquestion is one of state law, which we usually do well to\nleave to state courts.\n   But as I look to the Florida statute here, I cannot help\nbut see yet another reason why the Florida Supreme\nCourt got this case right. That statute authorizes damages\nonly for \u201can unreasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police\npower constituting a taking without just compensation.\u201d\nFla. Stat. \u00a7373.617 (2010); see ante, at 12. In what legal\nuniverse could a law authorizing damages only for a \u201ctak-\ning\u201d also provide damages when (as all agree) no taking\nhas occurred? I doubt that inside-out, upside-down uni-\nverse is the State of Florida. Certainly, none of the\nFlorida courts in this case suggested that the majority\u2019s\nhypothesized remedy actually exists; rather, the trial and\nappellate courts imposed a damages remedy on the mis-\ntaken theory that there had been a taking (although of\nexactly what neither was clear). See App. to Pet. for Cert.\nC\u20132; 5 So. 3d 8, 8 (2009). So I would, once more, affirm\nthe Florida Supreme Court, not make it say again what it\nhas already said\u2014that Koontz is not entitled to money\ndamages.\n                            III\n  Nollan and Dolan are important decisions, designed to\ncurb governments from using their power over land-use\npermitting to extract for free what the Takings Clause\nwould otherwise require them to pay for. But for no fewer\nthan three independent reasons, this case does not present\nthat problem. First and foremost, the government com-\nmits a taking only when it appropriates a specific property\ninterest, not when it requires a person to pay or spend\n18           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                          \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmoney. Here, the District never took or threatened\nsuch an interest; it tried to extract from Koontz solely a\ncommitment to spend money to repair public wetlands.\nSecond, Nollan and Dolan can operate only when the\ngovernment makes a demand of the permit applicant;\nthe decisions\u2019 prerequisite, in other words, is a condition.\nHere, the District never made such a demand: It informed\nKoontz that his applications did not meet legal require-\nments; it offered suggestions for bringing those applica-\ntions into compliance; and it solicited further proposals\nfrom Koontz to achieve the same end. That is not the stuff\nof which an unconstitutional condition is made. And\nthird, the Florida statute at issue here does not, in any\nevent, offer a damages remedy for imposing such a condi-\ntion. It provides relief only for a consummated taking,\nwhich did not occur here.\n   The majority\u2019s errors here are consequential. The ma-\njority turns a broad array of local land-use regulations into\nfederal constitutional questions. It deprives state and\nlocal governments of the flexibility they need to enhance\ntheir communities\u2014to ensure environmentally sound and\neconomically productive development. It places courts\nsmack in the middle of the most everyday local govern-\nment activity. As those consequences play out across the\ncountry, I believe the Court will rue today\u2019s decision. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n",

JOHNS RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT\n                   DISTRICT\n\n        CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA\n\n    No. 11\u20131447. Argued January 15, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nCoy Koontz, Sr., whose estate is represented here by petitioner, sought\n  permits to develop a section of his property from respondent St.\n  Johns River Water Management District (District), which, consistent\n  with Florida law, requires permit applicants wishing to build on wet-\n  lands to offset the resulting environmental damage. Koontz offered\n  to mitigate the environmental effects of his development proposal by\n  deeding to the District a conservation easement on nearly three-\n  quarters of his property. The District rejected Koontz\u2019s proposal and\n  informed him that it would approve construction only if he (1) re-\n  duced the size of his development and, inter alia, deeded to the Dis-\n  trict a conservation easement on the resulting larger remainder of his\n  property or (2) hired contractors to make improvements to District-\n  owned wetlands several miles away. Believing the District\u2019s de-\n  mands to be excessive in light of the environmental effects his pro-\n  posal would have caused, Koontz filed suit under a state law that\n  provides money damages for agency action that is an \u201cunreasonable\n  exercise of the state\u2019s police power constituting a taking without just\n  compensation.\u201d\n     The trial court found the District\u2019s actions unlawful because they\n  failed the requirements of Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483\n  U. S. 825, and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374. Those cases\n  held that the government may not condition the approval of a land-\n  use permit on the owner\u2019s relinquishment of a portion of his property\n  unless there is a nexus and rough proportionality between the gov-\n  ernment\u2019s demand and the effects of the proposed land use. The Dis-\n  trict Court of Appeal affirmed, but the State Supreme Court reversed\n  on two grounds. First, it held that petitioner\u2019s claim failed because,\n  unlike in Nollan or Dolan, the District denied the application. Se-\n2               KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                     MANAGEMENT DIST.                                    \n\n                             Syllabus\n\n\n    cond, the State Supreme Court held that a demand for money cannot\n    give rise to a claim under Nollan and Dolan.\nHeld:\n    1. The government\u2019s demand for property from a land-use permit\n applicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when it\n denies the permit. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) The unconstitutional conditions doctrine vindicates the Con-\n stitution\u2019s enumerated rights by preventing the government from co-\n ercing people into giving them up, and Nollan and Dolan represent a\n special application of this doctrine that protects the Fifth Amend-\n ment right to just compensation for property the government takes\n when owners apply for land-use permits. The standard set out in\n Nollan and Dolan reflects the danger of governmental coercion in this\n context while accommodating the government\u2019s legitimate need to\n offset the public costs of development through land use exactions.\n Dolan, supra, at 391; Nollan, supra, at 837. Pp. 6\u20138.\n       (b) The principles that undergird Nollan and Dolan do not\n change depending on whether the government approves a permit on\n the condition that the applicant turn over property or denies a permit\n because the applicant refuses to do so. Recognizing such a distinction\n would enable the government to evade the Nollan/Dolan limitations\n simply by phrasing its demands for property as conditions precedent\n to permit approval. This Court\u2019s unconstitutional conditions cases\n have long refused to attach significance to the distinction between\n conditions precedent and conditions subsequent. See, e.g., Frost &\n Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Comm\u2019n of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 592\u2013\n 593. It makes no difference that no property was actually taken in\n this case. Extortionate demands for property in the land-use permit-\n ting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not because they take\n property but because they impermissibly burden the right not to have\n property taken without just compensation. Nor does it matter that\n the District might have been able to deny Koontz\u2019s application out-\n right without giving him the option of securing a permit by agreeing\n to spend money improving public lands. It is settled that the uncon-\n stitutional conditions doctrine applies even when the government\n threatens to withhold a gratuitous benefit. See e.g., United States v.\n American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U. S. 194, 210. Pp. 8\u201311.\n       (c) The District concedes that the denial of a permit could give\n rise to a valid Nollan/Dolan claim, but urges that this Court should\n not review this particular denial because Koontz sued in the wrong\n court, for the wrong remedy, and at the wrong time. Most of its ar-\n guments raise questions of state law. But to the extent that respond-\n ent alleges a federal obstacle to adjudication of petitioner\u2019s claim, the\n Florida courts can consider respondent\u2019s arguments in the first in-\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nstance on remand. Finally, the District errs in arguing that because\nit gave Koontz another avenue to obtain permit approval, this Court\nneed not decide whether its demand for offsite improvements satis-\nfied Nollan and Dolan. Had Koontz been offered at least one alterna-\ntive that satisfied Nollan and Dolan, he would not have been subject-\ned to an unconstitutional condition. But the District\u2019s offer to\napprove a less ambitious project does not obviate the need to apply\nNollan and Dolan to the conditions it imposed on its approval of the\nproject Koontz actually proposed. Pp. 12\u201314.\n   2. The government\u2019s demand for property from a land-use permit\napplicant must satisfy the Nollan/Dolan requirements even when its\ndemand is for money. Pp. 14\u201322.\n      (a) Contrary to respondent\u2019s argument, Eastern Enterprises v.\nApfel, 524 U. S. 498, where five Justices concluded that the Takings\nClause does not apply to government-imposed financial obligations\nthat \u201cd[o] not operate upon or alter an identified property interest,\u201d\nid., at 540 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart), does not control here, where the demand for money did burden\nthe ownership of a specific parcel of land. Because of the direct link\nbetween the government\u2019s demand and a specific parcel of real prop-\nerty, this case implicates the central concern of Nollan and Dolan:\nthe risk that the government may deploy its substantial power and\ndiscretion in land-use permitting to pursue governmental ends that\nlack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to the effects of the\nproposed use of the property at issue. Pp. 15\u201318.\n      (b) The District argues that if monetary exactions are subject to\nNollan/Dolan scrutiny, then there will be no principled way of distin-\nguishing impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes. But\nthe District exaggerates both the extent to which that problem is\nunique to the land-use permitting context and the practical difficulty\nof distinguishing between the power to tax and the power to take by\neminent domain. It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]axes and user fees . . .\nare not \u2018takings,\u2019 \u201d Brown v. Legal Foundation of Wash., 538 U. S.\n216, 243, n. 2, yet this Court has repeatedly found takings where the\ngovernment, by confiscating financial obligations, achieved a result\nthat could have been obtained through taxation, e.g., id., at 232.\nPp. 18\u201321.\n      (c) The Court\u2019s holding that monetary exactions are subject to\nscrutiny under Nollan and Dolan will not work a revolution in land\nuse law or unduly limit the discretion of local authorities to imple-\nment sensible land use regulations. The rule that Nollan and Dolan\napply to monetary exactions has been the settled law in some of our\nNation\u2019s most populous States for many years, and the protections of\nthose cases are often redundant with the requirements of state law.\n4                KOONTZ v.

JOHNS \n\n     RIVER WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT\n\n    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF \n\n                       FLORIDA\n\n                                 [June 25, 2013] \n\n\n   JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Our decisions in Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n,\n483 U. S. 825 (1987), and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512\nU. S. 374 (1994), provide important protection against the\nmisuse of the power of land-use regulation. In those cases,\nwe held that a unit of government may not condition the\napproval of a land-use permit on the owner\u2019s relinquish-\nment of a portion of his property unless there is a \u201cnexus\u201d\nand \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the government\u2019s\ndemand and the effects of the proposed land use. In this\ncase, the St. Johns River Water Management District\n(District) believes that it circumvented Nollan and Dolan\nbecause of the way in which it structured its handling of\na permit application submitted by Coy Koontz, Sr., whose\nestate is represented in this Court by Coy Koontz, Jr.1\nThe District did not approve his application on the condi-\ntion that he surrender an interest in his land. Instead, the\nDistrict, after suggesting that he could obtain approval by\nsigning over such an interest, denied his application be-\ncause he refused to yield. The Florida Supreme Court\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 1 For   ease of reference, this opinion refers to both men as \u201cpetitioner.\u201d\n2            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nblessed this maneuver and thus effectively interred those\nimportant decisions. Because we conclude that Nollan\nand Dolan cannot be evaded in this way, the Florida Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision must be reversed.\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   In 1972, petitioner purchased an undeveloped 14.9-acre\ntract of land on the south side of Florida State Road 50, a\ndivided four-lane highway east of Orlando. The property\nis located less than 1,000 feet from that road\u2019s intersection\nwith Florida State Road 408, a tolled expressway that is\none of Orlando\u2019s major thoroughfares.\n   A drainage ditch runs along the property\u2019s western\nedge, and high-voltage power lines bisect it into northern\nand southern sections. The combined effect of the ditch, a\n100-foot wide area kept clear for the power lines, the\nhighways, and other construction on nearby parcels is to\nisolate the northern section of petitioner\u2019s property from\nany other undeveloped land. Although largely classified\nas wetlands by the State, the northern section drains well;\nthe most significant standing water forms in ruts in an\nunpaved road used to access the power lines. The natural\ntopography of the property\u2019s southern section is somewhat\nmore diverse, with a small creek, forested uplands, and\nwetlands that sometimes have water as much as a foot\ndeep. A wildlife survey found evidence of animals that\noften frequent developed areas: raccoons, rabbits, several\nspecies of bird, and a turtle. The record also indicates that\nthe land may be a suitable habitat for opossums.\n   The same year that petitioner purchased his property,\nFlorida enacted the Water Resources Act, which divided\nthe State into five water management districts and au-\nthorized each district to regulate \u201cconstruction that con-\nnects to, draws water from, drains water into, or is placed\nin or across the waters in the state.\u201d 1972 Fla. Laws ch.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n72\u2013299, pt. IV, \u00a71(5), pp. 1115, 1116 (codified as amended\nat Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.403(5) (2010)). Under the Act, a land-\nowner wishing to undertake such construction must obtain\nfrom the relevant district a Management and Storage of\nSurface Water (MSSW) permit, which may impose \u201csuch\nreasonable conditions\u201d on the permit as are \u201cnecessary to\nassure\u201d that construction will \u201cnot be harmful to the water\nresources of the district.\u201d 1972 Fla. Laws \u00a74(1), at 1118\n(codified as amended at Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.413(1)).\n   In 1984, in an effort to protect the State\u2019s rapidly dimin-\nishing wetlands, the Florida Legislature passed the War-\nren S. Henderson Wetlands Protection Act, which made\nit illegal for anyone to \u201cdredge or fill in, on, or over sur-\nface waters\u201d without a Wetlands Resource Management\n(WRM) permit. 1984 Fla. Laws ch. 84\u201379, pt. VIII,\n\u00a7403.905(1), pp. 204\u2013205. Under the Henderson Act,\npermit applicants are required to provide \u201creasonable\nassurance\u201d that proposed construction on wetlands is \u201cnot\ncontrary to the public interest,\u201d as defined by an enumer-\nated list of criteria. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.414(1). Consistent\nwith the Henderson Act, the St. Johns River Water Man-\nagement District, the district with jurisdiction over peti-\ntioner\u2019s land, requires that permit applicants wishing to\nbuild on wetlands offset the resulting environmental\ndamage by creating, enhancing, or preserving wetlands\nelsewhere.\n   Petitioner decided to develop the 3.7-acre northern\nsection of his property, and in 1994 he applied to the\nDistrict for MSSW and WRM permits. Under his pro-\nposal, petitioner would have raised the elevation of the\nnorthernmost section of his land to make it suitable for a\nbuilding, graded the land from the southern edge of the\nbuilding site down to the elevation of the high-voltage\nelectrical lines, and installed a dry-bed pond for retaining\nand gradually releasing stormwater runoff from the build-\ning and its parking lot. To mitigate the environmental\n4            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\neffects of his proposal, petitioner offered to foreclose any\npossible future development of the approximately 11-acre\nsouthern section of his land by deeding to the District a\nconservation easement on that portion of his property.\n   The District considered the 11-acre conservation ease-\nment to be inadequate, and it informed petitioner that it\nwould approve construction only if he agreed to one of two\nconcessions. First, the District proposed that petitioner\nreduce the size of his development to 1 acre and deed to\nthe District a conservation easement on the remaining\n13.9 acres. To reduce the development area, the District\nsuggested that petitioner could eliminate the dry-bed pond\nfrom his proposal and instead install a more costly subsur-\nface stormwater management system beneath the building\nsite. The District also suggested that petitioner install\nretaining walls rather than gradually sloping the land\nfrom the building site down to the elevation of the rest of\nhis property to the south.\n   In the alternative, the District told petitioner that he\ncould proceed with the development as proposed, build-\ning on 3.7 acres and deeding a conservation easement to\nthe government on the remainder of the property, if he\nalso agreed to hire contractors to make improvements to\nDistrict-owned land several miles away. Specifically, peti-\ntioner could pay to replace culverts on one parcel or fill in\nditches on another. Either of those projects would have\nenhanced approximately 50 acres of District-owned wet-\nlands. When the District asks permit applicants to fund\noffsite mitigation work, its policy is never to require any\nparticular offsite project, and it did not do so here. In-\nstead, the District said that it \u201cwould also favorably con-\nsider\u201d alternatives to its suggested offsite mitigation\nprojects if petitioner proposed something \u201cequivalent.\u201d\nApp. 75.\n   Believing the District\u2019s demands for mitigation to be\nexcessive in light of the environmental effects that his\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Among other claims, he argued that he was\nentitled to relief under Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.617(2), which allows\nowners to recover \u201cmonetary damages\u201d if a state agency\u2019s\naction is \u201can unreasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police\npower constituting a taking without just compensation.\u201d\n                              B\n   The Florida Circuit Court granted the District\u2019s mo-\ntion to dismiss on the ground that petitioner had not ade-\nquately exhausted his state-administrative remedies, but\nthe Florida District Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit re-\nversed. On remand, the State Circuit Court held a 2-day\nbench trial. After considering testimony from several ex-\nperts who examined petitioner\u2019s property, the trial court\nfound that the property\u2019s northern section had already\nbeen \u201cseriously degraded\u201d by extensive construction on the\nsurrounding parcels. App. to Pet. for Cert. D\u20133. In light\nof this finding and petitioner\u2019s offer to dedicate nearly\nthree-quarters of his land to the District, the trial court\nconcluded that any further mitigation in the form of pay-\nment for offsite improvements to District property lacked\nboth a nexus and rough proportionality to the environ-\nmental impact of the proposed construction. Id., at D\u201311.\nIt accordingly held the District\u2019s actions unlawful under\nour decisions in Nollan and Dolan.\n   The Florida District Court affirmed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635309\"><a href=\"/fladistctapp/9o7Z/st-johns-river-water-management-v-koontz/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009),\nbut the State Supreme Court reversed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2011).

S. ____ (2013)          7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1974), we concluded that a county impermissibly bur-\ndened the right to travel by extending healthcare benefits\nonly to those indigent sick who had been residents of\nthe county for at least one year. Those cases reflect an\noverarching principle, known as the unconstitutional condi-\ntions doctrine, that vindicates the Constitution\u2019s enumer-\nated rights by preventing the government from coercing\npeople into giving them up.\n   Nollan and Dolan \u201cinvolve a special application\u201d of this\ndoctrine that protects the Fifth Amendment right to just\ncompensation for property the government takes when\nowners apply for land-use permits. Lingle v. Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 547 (2005); Dolan, 512 U. S.,\nat 385 (invoking \u201cthe well-settled doctrine of \u2018unconstitu-\ntional conditions\u2019 \u201d). Our decisions in those cases reflect\ntwo realities of the permitting process. The first is that\nland-use permit applicants are especially vulnerable to the\ntype of coercion that the unconstitutional conditions doc-\ntrine prohibits because the government often has broad\ndiscretion to deny a permit that is worth far more than\nproperty it would like to take. By conditioning a building\npermit on the owner\u2019s deeding over a public right-of-\nway, for example, the government can pressure an owner\ninto voluntarily giving up property for which the Fifth\nAmendment would otherwise require just compensation.\nSee id., at 384; Nollan, 483 U. S., at 831. So long as the\nbuilding permit is more valuable than any just compensa-\ntion the owner could hope to receive for the right-of-way,\nthe owner is likely to accede to the government\u2019s demand,\nno matter how unreasonable. Extortionate demands of\nthis sort frustrate the Fifth Amendment right to just\ncompensation, and the unconstitutional conditions doc-\ntrine prohibits them.\n   A second reality of the permitting process is that many\nproposed land uses threaten to impose costs on the public\nthat dedications of property can offset. Where a building\n8           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\nproposal would substantially increase traffic congestion,\nfor example, officials might condition permit approval on\nthe owner\u2019s agreement to deed over the land needed to\nwiden a public road. Respondent argues that a similar\nrationale justifies the exaction at issue here: petitioner\u2019s\nproposed construction project, it submits, would destroy\nwetlands on his property, and in order to compensate\nfor this loss, respondent demands that he enhance wet-\nlands elsewhere. Insisting that landowners internalize the\nnegative externalities of their conduct is a hallmark of\nresponsible land-use policy, and we have long sustained\nsuch regulations against constitutional attack. See Vil-\nlage of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926).\n   Nollan and Dolan accommodate both realities by allow-\ning the government to condition approval of a permit on\nthe dedication of property to the public so long as there is\na \u201cnexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d between the prop-\nerty that the government demands and the social costs of\nthe applicant\u2019s proposal. Dolan, supra, at 391; Nollan, 483\nU. S., at 837. Our precedents thus enable permitting\nauthorities to insist that applicants bear the full costs of\ntheir proposals while still forbidding the government from\nengaging in \u201cout-and-out . . . extortion\u201d that would thwart\nthe Fifth Amendment right to just compensation. Ibid.\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Under Nollan and\nDolan the government may choose whether and how a per-\nmit applicant is required to mitigate the impacts of a\nproposed development, but it may not leverage its legiti-\nmate interest in mitigation to pursue governmental ends\nthat lack an essential nexus and rough proportionality to\nthose impacts.\n                          B\n  The principles that undergird our decisions in Nollan\nand Dolan do not change depending on whether the gov-\nernment approves a permit on the condition that the ap-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

We have often concluded\nthat denials of governmental benefits were impermissible\nunder the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. See, e.g.,\nPerry, 408 U. S., at 597 (explaining that the government\n\u201cmay not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that in-\nfringes his constitutionally protected interests\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Memorial Hospital, 415 U. S. 250 (finding uncon-\nstitutional condition where government denied healthcare\nbenefits). In so holding, we have recognized that regard-\nless of whether the government ultimately succeeds in\npressuring someone into forfeiting a constitutional right,\nthe unconstitutional conditions doctrine forbids burdening\nthe Constitution\u2019s enumerated rights by coercively with-\nholding benefits from those who exercise them.\n   A contrary rule would be especially untenable in this\ncase because it would enable the government to evade the\nlimitations of Nollan and Dolan simply by phrasing its\ndemands for property as conditions precedent to permit\napproval. Under the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s approach, a\ngovernment order stating that a permit is \u201capproved if \u201d\nthe owner turns over property would be subject to Nollan\nand Dolan, but an identical order that uses the words\n\u201cdenied until\u201d would not. Our unconstitutional condi-\ntions cases have long refused to attach significance to the\ndistinction between conditions precedent and conditions\nsubsequent. See Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad\nComm\u2019n of Cal., 271 U. S. 583, 592\u2013593 (1926) (invalidat-\ning regulation that required the petitioner to give up a\nconstitutional right \u201cas a condition precedent to the en-\njoyment of a privilege\u201d); Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton,\n146 U. S. 202, 207 (1892) (invalidating statute \u201crequiring\nthe corporation, as a condition precedent to obtaining a per-\nmit to do business within the State, to surrender a right\nand privilege secured to it by the Constitution\u201d). See\nalso Flower Mound, 135 S. W. 3d, at 639 (\u201cThe government\n10           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                            \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\ncannot sidestep constitutional protections merely by re-\nphrasing its decision from \u2018only if \u2019 to \u2018not unless\u2019 \u201d). To do\nso here would effectively render Nollan and Dolan a dead\nletter.\n   The Florida Supreme Court puzzled over how the gov-\nernment\u2019s demand for property can violate the Takings\nClause even though \u201c \u2018no property of any kind was ever\ntaken,\u2019 \u201d 77 So. 3d, at 1225 (quoting 5 So. 3d, at 20 (Griffin,\nJ., dissenting)); see also 77 So. 3d, at 1229\u20131230, but the\nunconstitutional conditions doctrine provides a ready\nanswer. Extortionate demands for property in the land-\nuse permitting context run afoul of the Takings Clause not\nbecause they take property but because they impermis-\nsibly burden the right not to have property taken without\njust compensation. As in other unconstitutional condi-\ntions cases in which someone refuses to cede a constitutional\nright in the face of coercive pressure, the impermissible\ndenial of a governmental benefit is a constitutionally cog-\nnizable injury.\n   Nor does it make a difference, as respondent suggests,\nthat the government might have been able to deny peti-\ntioner\u2019s application outright without giving him the option\nof securing a permit by agreeing to spend money to im-\nprove public lands. See Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New\nYork City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978). Virtually all of our uncon-\nstitutional conditions cases involve a gratuitous govern-\nmental benefit of some kind. See, e.g., Regan, 461 U. S.\n540 (tax benefits); Memorial Hospital, 415 U. S. 250\n(healthcare); Perry, 408 U. S. 593 (public employment);\nUnited States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 71 (1936) (crop pay-\nments); Frost, supra (business license). Yet we have re-\npeatedly rejected the argument that if the government\nneed not confer a benefit at all, it can withhold the benefit\nbecause someone refuses to give up constitutional rights.\nE.g., United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539\nU. S. 194, 210 (2003) (\u201c[T]he government may not deny a\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Updegraff, 344\nU. S. 183, 191 (1952) (explaining in unconstitutional con-\nditions case that to focus on \u201cthe facile generalization that\nthere is no constitutionally protected right to public em-\nployment is to obscure the issue\u201d). Even if respondent\nwould have been entirely within its rights in denying the\npermit for some other reason, that greater authority does\nnot imply a lesser power to condition permit approval on\npetitioner\u2019s forfeiture of his constitutional rights. See\nNollan, 483 U. S., at 836\u2013837 (explaining that \u201c[t]he evi-\ndent constitutional propriety\u201d of prohibiting a land use\n\u201cdisappears . . . if the condition substituted for the prohibi-\ntion utterly fails to further the end advanced as the justifi-\ncation for the prohibition\u201d).\n   That is not to say, however, that there is no relevant\ndifference between a consummated taking and the denial\nof a permit based on an unconstitutionally extortionate\ndemand. Where the permit is denied and the condition\nis never imposed, nothing has been taken. While the un-\nconstitutional conditions doctrine recognizes that this\nburdens a constitutional right, the Fifth Amendment man-\ndates a particular remedy\u2014just compensation\u2014only for\ntakings. In cases where there is an excessive demand but\nno taking, whether money damages are available is not a\nquestion of federal constitutional law but of the cause of\naction\u2014whether state or federal\u2014on which the landowner\nrelies. Because petitioner brought his claim pursuant to\na state law cause of action, the Court has no occasion\nto discuss what remedies might be available for a\nNollan/Dolan unconstitutional conditions violation either\nhere or in other cases.\n12          KOONTZ v.

JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              C\n   At oral argument, respondent conceded that the denial\nof a permit could give rise to a valid claim under Nollan\nand Dolan, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\u201334, but it urged that we\nshould not review the particular denial at issue here\nbecause petitioner sued in the wrong court, for the wrong\nremedy, and at the wrong time. Most of respondent\u2019s\nobjections to the posture of this case raise questions of\nFlorida procedure that are not ours to decide. See Mul-\nlaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691 (1975); Murdock v.\nMemphis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88971\"><a href=\"/scotus/srZ/murdock-v-memphis/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (1875). But to the extent that\nrespondent suggests that the posture of this case creates\nsome federal obstacle to adjudicating petitioner\u2019s unconsti-\ntutional conditions claim, we remand for the Florida\ncourts to consider that argument in the first instance.\n   Respondent argues that we should affirm because,\nrather than suing for damages in the Florida trial court as\nauthorized by Fla. Stat. \u00a7373.617, petitioner should have\nfirst sought judicial review of the denial of his permit in\nthe Florida appellate court under the State\u2019s Administra-\ntive Procedure Act, see \u00a7\u00a7120.68(1), (2) (2010). The Flor-\nida Supreme Court has said that the appellate court is\nthe \u201cproper forum to resolve\u201d a \u201cclaim that an agency has\napplied a . . . statute or rule in such a way that the ag-\ngrieved party\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated,\u201d\nKey Haven Associated Enterprises, 427 So. 2d, at 158, and\nrespondent has argued throughout this litigation that\npetitioner brought his unconstitutional conditions claim in\nthe wrong forum. Two members of the Florida Supreme\nCourt credited respondent\u2019s argument, 77 So. 3d, at 1231\u2013\n1232, but four others refused to address it. We decline\nrespondent\u2019s invitation to second-guess a State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s treatment of its own procedural law.\n   Respondent also contends that we should affirm because\npetitioner sued for damages but is at most entitled to an\ninjunction ordering that his permit issue without any\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconditions. But we need not decide whether federal law\nauthorizes plaintiffs to recover damages for unconstitu-\ntional conditions claims predicated on the Takings Clause\nbecause petitioner brought his claim under state law.\nFlorida law allows property owners to sue for \u201cdamages\u201d\nwhenever a state agency\u2019s action is \u201can unreasonable ex-\nercise of the state\u2019s police power constituting a taking\nwithout just compensation.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7373.617.\nWhether that provision covers an unconstitutional condi-\ntions claim like the one at issue here is a question of state\nlaw that the Florida Supreme Court did not address and\non which we will not opine.\n   For similar reasons, we decline to reach respondent\u2019s\nargument that its demands for property were too indefi-\nnite to give rise to liability under Nollan and Dolan. The\nFlorida Supreme Court did not reach the question whether\nrespondent issued a demand of sufficient concreteness to\ntrigger the special protections of Nollan and Dolan. It\nrelied instead on the Florida District Court of Appeals\u2019\ncharacterization of respondent\u2019s behavior as a demand for\nNollan/Dolan purposes. See 77 So. 3d, at 1224 (quoting 5\nSo. 3d, at 10). Whether that characterization is correct is\nbeyond the scope of the questions the Court agreed to take\nup for review. If preserved, the issue remains open on\nremand for the Florida Supreme Court to address. This\nCourt therefore has no occasion to consider how concrete\nand specific a demand must be to give rise to liability un-\nder Nollan and Dolan.\n   Finally, respondent argues that we need not decide\nwhether its demand for offsite improvements satisfied\nNollan and Dolan because it gave petitioner another\navenue for obtaining permit approval. Specifically, re-\nspondent said that it would have approved a revised per-\nmit application that reduced the footprint of petitioner\u2019s\nproposed construction site from 3.7 acres to 1 acre and\nplaced a conservation easement on the remaining 13.9\n14           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                          \n\n                    Opinion of the Court \n\n\nacres of petitioner\u2019s land. Respondent argues that regard-\nless of whether its demands for offsite mitigation satisfied\nNollan and Dolan, we must separately consider each of\npetitioner\u2019s options, one of which did not require any of the\noffsite work the trial court found objectionable.\n  Respondent\u2019s argument is flawed because the option to\nwhich it points\u2014developing only 1 acre of the site and\ngranting a conservation easement on the rest\u2014involves\nthe same issue as the option to build on 3.7 acres and\nperform offsite mitigation. We agree with respondent\nthat, so long as a permitting authority offers the landowner\nat least one alternative that would satisfy Nollan and\nDolan, the landowner has not been subjected to an uncon-\nstitutional condition. But respondent\u2019s suggestion that we\nshould treat its offer to let petitioner build on 1 acre as\nan alternative to offsite mitigation misapprehends the gov-\nernmental benefit that petitioner was denied. Petitioner\nsought to develop 3.7 acres, but respondent in effect told\npetitioner that it would not allow him to build on 2.7 of\nthose acres unless he agreed to spend money improving\npublic lands. Petitioner claims that he was wrongfully\ndenied a permit to build on those 2.7 acres. For that\nreason, respondent\u2019s offer to approve a less ambitious\nbuilding project does not obviate the need to determine\nwhether the demand for offsite mitigation satisfied Nollan\nand Dolan.\n                            III\n  We turn to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s alternative\nholding that petitioner\u2019s claim fails because respondent\nasked him to spend money rather than give up an ease-\nment on his land. A predicate for any unconstitutional\nconditions claim is that the government could not have\nconstitutionally ordered the person asserting the claim to\ndo what it attempted to pressure that person into doing.\nSee Rumsfeld, 547 U. S., at 59\u201360. For that reason, we\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbegan our analysis in both Nollan and Dolan by observing\nthat if the government had directly seized the easements\nit sought to obtain through the permitting process, it would\nhave committed a per se taking. See Dolan, 512 U. S.,\nat 384; Nollan, 483 U. S., at 831. The Florida Su-\npreme Court held that petitioner\u2019s claim fails at this first\nstep because the subject of the exaction at issue here was\nmoney rather than a more tangible interest in real prop-\nerty. 77 So. 3d, at 1230. Respondent and the dissent take\nthe same position, citing the concurring and dissenting\nopinions in Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498\n(1998), for the proposition that an obligation to spend\nmoney can never provide the basis for a takings claim.\nSee post, at 5\u20138 (opinion of KAGAN, J.).\n   We note as an initial matter that if we accepted this\nargument it would be very easy for land-use permitting\nofficials to evade the limitations of Nollan and Dolan.\nBecause the government need only provide a permit appli-\ncant with one alternative that satisfies the nexus and\nrough proportionality standards, a permitting authority\nwishing to exact an easement could simply give the owner\na choice of either surrendering an easement or making a\npayment equal to the easement\u2019s value. Such so-called \u201cin\nlieu of \u201d fees are utterly commonplace, Rosenberg, The\nChanging Culture of American Land Use Regulation:\nPaying for Growth with Impact Fees, 59 S. M. U. L. Rev.\n177, 202\u2013203 (2006), and they are functionally equivalent\nto other types of land use exactions. For that reason and\nthose that follow, we reject respondent\u2019s argument and\nhold that so-called \u201cmonetary exactions\u201d must satisfy the\nnexus and rough proportionality requirements of Nollan\nand Dolan.\n                            A\n  In Eastern Enterprises, supra, the United States retro-\nactively imposed on a former mining company an obliga-\n16           KOONTZ v.

A four-Justice plurality concluded that the\nstatute\u2019s imposition of retroactive financial liability was so\narbitrary that it violated the Takings Clause. Id., at 529\u2013\n537. Although JUSTICE KENNEDY concurred in the result\non due process grounds, he joined four other Justices in\ndissent in arguing that the Takings Clause does not apply\nto government-imposed financial obligations that \u201cd[o] not\noperate upon or alter an identified property interest.\u201d Id.,\nat 540 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in\npart); see id., at 554\u2013556 (BREYER, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe\n\u2018private property\u2019 upon which the [Takings] Clause tradi-\ntionally has focused is a specific interest in physical or\nintellectual property\u201d). Relying on the concurrence and\ndissent in Eastern Enterprises, respondent argues that a\nrequirement that petitioner spend money improving public\nlands could not give rise to a taking.\n   Respondent\u2019s argument rests on a mistaken premise.\nUnlike the financial obligation in Eastern Enterprises, the\ndemand for money at issue here did \u201coperate upon . . . an\nidentified property interest\u201d by directing the owner of a\nparticular piece of property to make a monetary payment.\nId., at 540 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). In this case, unlike\nEastern Enterprises, the monetary obligation burdened\npetitioner\u2019s ownership of a specific parcel of land. In that\nsense, this case bears resemblance to our cases holding\nthat the government must pay just compensation when it\ntakes a lien\u2014a right to receive money that is secured by a\nparticular piece of property.

We are not here con-\ncerned with whether it would be \u201carbitrary or unfair\u201d for\nrespondent to order a landowner to make improvements\nto public lands that are nearby. Id., at 554 (BREYER, J.,\ndissenting). Whatever the wisdom of such a policy, it\nwould transfer an interest in property from the landowner\nto the government. For that reason, any such demand\nwould amount to a per se taking similar to the taking of an\neasement or a lien. Cf. Dolan, 512 U. S., at 384; Nollan,\n483 U. S., at 831.\n                              B\n   Respondent and the dissent argue that if monetary\nexactions are made subject to scrutiny under Nollan and\nDolan, then there will be no principled way of distinguish-\ning impermissible land-use exactions from property taxes.\nSee post, at 9\u201310. We think they exaggerate both the\nextent to which that problem is unique to the land-use\npermitting context and the practical difficulty of distin-\nguishing between the power to tax and the power to take\nby eminent domain.\n   It is beyond dispute that \u201c[t]axes and user fees . . . are\nnot \u2018takings.\u2019 \u201d Brown, supra, at 243, n. 2 (SCALIA, J.,\ndissenting). We said as much in County of Mobile v. Kim-\nball, 102 U. S. 691, 703 (1881), and our cases have been\nclear on that point ever since. United States v. Sperry\nCorp., 493 U. S. 52, 62, n. 9 (1989); see A. Magnano Co. v.\nHamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44 (1934); Dane v. Jackson, 256\nU. S. 589, 599 (1921); Henderson Bridge Co. v. Henderson\nCity, 173 U. S. 592, 614\u2013615 (1899). This case therefore\ndoes not affect the ability of governments to impose prop-\nerty taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations\nthat may impose financial burdens on property owners.\n   At the same time, we have repeatedly found takings\nwhere the government, by confiscating financial obliga-\ntions, achieved a result that could have been obtained by\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposing a tax. Most recently, in Brown, supra, at 232,\nwe were unanimous in concluding that a State Supreme\nCourt\u2019s seizure of the interest on client funds held in\nescrow was a taking despite the unquestionable constitu-\ntional propriety of a tax that would have raised exactly the\nsame revenue. Our holding in Brown followed from Phil-\nlips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156 (1998),\nand Webb\u2019s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449\nU. S. 155 (1980), two earlier cases in which we treated\nconfiscations of money as takings despite their functional\nsimilarity to a tax. Perhaps most closely analogous to the\npresent case, we have repeatedly held that the govern-\nment takes property when it seizes liens, and in so ruling\nwe have never considered whether the government could\nhave achieved an economically equivalent result through\ntaxation. Armstrong, 364 U. S. 40; Louisville Joint Stock\nLand Bank, 295 U. S. 555.\n   Two facts emerge from those cases. The first is that the\nneed to distinguish taxes from takings is not a creature of\nour holding today that monetary exactions are subject to\nscrutiny under Nollan and Dolan. Rather, the problem is\ninherent in this Court\u2019s long-settled view that property\nthe government could constitutionally demand through its\ntaxing power can also be taken by eminent domain.\n   Second, our cases show that teasing out the difference\nbetween taxes and takings is more difficult in theory than\nin practice. Brown is illustrative. Similar to respondent\nin this case, the respondents in Brown argued that extend-\ning the protections of the Takings Clause to a bank\naccount would open a Pandora\u2019s Box of constitutional chal-\nlenges to taxes.

Any such\nargument would have been implausible under state law; in\nWashington, taxes are levied by the legislature, not the\ncourts. See 538 U. S., at 242, n. 2 (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   The same dynamic is at work in this case because Flor-\nida law greatly circumscribes respondent\u2019s power to tax.\nSee Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7373.503 (authorizing respondent to\nimpose ad valorem tax on properties within its jurisdic-\ntion); \u00a7373.109 (authorizing respondent to charge permit\napplication fees but providing that such fees \u201cshall not\nexceed the cost . . . for processing, monitoring, and inspect-\ning for compliance with the permit\u201d). If respondent had\nargued that its demand for money was a tax, it would have\neffectively conceded that its denial of petitioner\u2019s permit\nwas improper under Florida law. Far from making that\nconcession, respondent has maintained throughout this\nlitigation that it considered petitioner\u2019s money to be a\nsubstitute for his deeding to the public a conservation\neasement on a larger parcel of undeveloped land.3\n   This case does not require us to say more. We need\nnot decide at precisely what point a land-use permitting\ncharge denominated by the government as a \u201ctax\u201d becomes\n\u201cso arbitrary . . . that it was not the exertion of taxation\nbut a confiscation of property.\u201d Brushaber v. Union Pacific\nR. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 24\u201325 (1916). For present purposes, it\nsuffices to say that despite having long recognized that\n\u201cthe power of taxation should not be confused with the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Citing cases in which state courts have treated similar governmen-\n\ntal demands for money differently, the dissent predicts that courts will\n\u201cstruggle to draw a coherent boundary\u201d between taxes and excessive\ndemands for money that violate Nollan and Dolan. Post, at 9\u201310. But\nthe cases the dissent cites illustrate how the frequent need to decide\nwhether a particular demand for money qualifies as a tax under state\nlaw, and the resulting state statutes and judicial precedents on point,\ngreatly reduce the practical difficulty of resolving the same issue in\nfederal constitutional cases like this one.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

That\nis hardly surprising, for the dissent is correct that state\nlaw normally provides an independent check on excessive\nland use permitting fees.

Post, at 11. In any\nevent, the dissent\u2019s argument that land use permit appli-\ncants need no further protection when the government\ndemands money is really an argument for overruling\nNollan and Dolan.

See Nollan, 483 U. S., at\n838.

California Coastal Comm\u2019n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), and\nDolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374 (1994), the govern-\nment approves a building permit on the condition that the\nlandowner relinquish an interest in real property, like an\neasement. The significant legal questions that the Court\nresolves today are whether Nollan and Dolan also apply\nwhen that case is varied in two ways. First, what if the\ngovernment does not approve the permit, but instead\ndemands that the condition be fulfilled before it will do so?\nSecond, what if the condition entails not transferring real\nproperty, but simply paying money? This case also raises\nother, more fact-specific issues I will address: whether the\ngovernment here imposed any condition at all, and whether\npetitioner Coy Koontz suffered any compensable injury.\n   I think the Court gets the first question it addresses\nright. The Nollan-Dolan standard applies not only when\nthe government approves a development permit condi-\ntioned on the owner\u2019s conveyance of a property interest\n(i.e., imposes a condition subsequent), but also when the\ngovernment denies a permit until the owner meets the\ncondition (i.e., imposes a condition precedent). That\n2           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                 MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                  KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmeans an owner may challenge the denial of a permit on\nthe ground that the government\u2019s condition lacks the\n\u201cnexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality\u201d to the development\u2019s\nsocial costs that Nollan and Dolan require. Still, the\ncondition-subsequent and condition-precedent situations\ndiffer in an important way. When the government grants\na permit subject to the relinquishment of real property,\nand that condition does not satisfy Nollan and Dolan, then\nthe government has taken the property and must pay just\ncompensation under the Fifth Amendment. But when the\ngovernment denies a permit because an owner has refused\nto accede to that same demand, nothing has actually been\ntaken. The owner is entitled to have the improper condi-\ntion removed; and he may be entitled to a monetary remedy\ncreated by state law for imposing such a condition; but\nhe cannot be entitled to constitutional compensation for a\ntaking of property. So far, we all agree.\n   Our core disagreement concerns the second question the\nCourt addresses. The majority extends Nollan and Dolan\nto cases in which the government conditions a permit not\non the transfer of real property, but instead on the pay-\nment or expenditure of money. That runs roughshod over\nEastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498 (1998), which\nheld that the government may impose ordinary financial\nobligations without triggering the Takings Clause\u2019s pro-\ntections. The boundaries of the majority\u2019s new rule are\nuncertain. But it threatens to subject a vast array of\nland-use regulations, applied daily in States and localities\nthroughout the country, to heightened constitutional\nscrutiny. I would not embark on so unwise an adventure,\nand would affirm the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n   I also would affirm for two independent reasons estab-\nlishing that Koontz cannot get the money damages he\nseeks. First, respondent St. Johns River Water Manage-\nment District (District) never demanded anything (includ-\ning money) in exchange for a permit; the Nollan-Dolan\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nstandard therefore does not come into play (even assuming\nthat test applies to demands for money). Second, no tak-\ning occurred in this case because Koontz never acceded to\na demand (even had there been one), and so no property\nchanged hands; as just noted, Koontz therefore cannot\nclaim just compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The\nmajority does not take issue with my first conclusion, and\naffirmatively agrees with my second. But the majority\nthinks Koontz might still be entitled to money damages,\nand remands to the Florida Supreme Court on that ques-\ntion. I do not see how, and expect that court will so rule.\n                             I\n   Claims that government regulations violate the Takings\nClause by unduly restricting the use of property are gen-\nerally \u201cgoverned by the standards set forth in Penn Cen-\ntral Transp.

Id., at 547. Nollan and Dolan prevent the govern-\nment from exploiting the landowner\u2019s permit application\nto evade the constitutional obligation to pay for the prop-\nerty. They do so, as the majority explains, by subjecting\nthe government\u2019s demand to heightened scrutiny: The\ngovernment may condition a land-use permit on the relin-\nquishment of real property only if it shows a \u201cnexus\u201d and\n\u201crough proportionality\u201d between the demand made and\n\u201cthe impact of the proposed development.\u201d Dolan, 512\nU. S., at 386, 391; see ante, at 8. Nollan and Dolan thus\nserve not to address excessive regulatory burdens on land\nuse (the function of Penn Central), but instead to stop the\ngovernment from imposing an \u201cunconstitutional condition\u201d\u2014\na requirement that a person give up his constitutional\nright to receive just compensation \u201cin exchange for a dis-\ncretionary benefit\u201d having \u201clittle or no relationship\u201d to the\nproperty taken. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 547.\n   Accordingly, the Nollan-Dolan test applies only when\nthe property the government demands during the permit-\nting process is the kind it otherwise would have to pay\nfor\u2014or, put differently, when the appropriation of that\nproperty, outside the permitting process, would constitute\na taking. That is why Nollan began by stating that \u201c[h]ad\nCalifornia simply required the Nollans to make an ease-\nment across their beachfront available to the public . . . ,\nrather than conditioning their permit to rebuild their\nhouse on their agreeing to do so, we have no doubt there\nwould have been a taking\u201d requiring just compensation.\n483 U. S., at 831. And it is why Dolan started by main-\ntaining that \u201chad the city simply required petitioner to\ndedicate a strip of land . . . for public use, rather than\nconditioning the grant of her permit to [d]evelop her prop-\nerty on such a dedication, a taking would have occurred.\u201d\n512 U. S., at 384. Even the majority acknowledges this\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Only if that is true could the\ngovernment\u2019s demand for the property force a landowner\nto relinquish his constitutional right to just compensation.\n   Here, Koontz claims that the District demanded that he\nspend money to improve public wetlands, not that he hand\nover a real property interest. I assume for now that the\nDistrict made that demand (although I think it did not,\nsee infra, at 12\u201316.) The key question then is: Independ-\nent of the permitting process, does requiring a person to\npay money to the government, or spend money on its\nbehalf, constitute a taking requiring just compensation?\nOnly if the answer is yes does the Nollan-Dolan test apply.\n   But we have already answered that question no. East-\nern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, as the Court de-\nscribes, involved a federal statute requiring a former\nmining company to pay a large sum of money for the\nhealth benefits of retired employees. Five Members of the\nCourt determined that the law did not effect a taking,\ndistinguishing between the appropriation of a specific\nproperty interest and the imposition of an order to pay\nmoney. JUSTICE KENNEDY acknowledged in his control-\nling opinion that the statute \u201cimpose[d] a staggering fi-\nnancial burden\u201d (which influenced his conclusion that it\nviolated due process). Id., at 540 (opinion concurring in\njudgment and dissenting in part). Still, JUSTICE KENNEDY\nexplained, the law did not effect a taking because it did\nnot \u201coperate upon or alter\u201d a \u201cspecific and identified prop-\nert[y] or property right[ ].\u201d Id., at 540\u2013541. Instead, \u201c[t]he\nlaw simply imposes an obligation to perform an act, the\npayment of benefits. The statute is indifferent as to how\nthe regulated entity elects to comply or the property it\nuses to do so.\u201d Id., at 540. JUSTICE BREYER, writing for\n6            KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                            \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nfour more Justices, agreed. He stated that the Takings\nClause applies only when the government appropriates a\n\u201cspecific interest in physical or intellectual property\u201d or \u201ca\nspecific, separately identifiable fund of money\u201d; by con-\ntrast, the Clause has no bearing when the government\nimposes \u201can ordinary liability to pay money.\u201d Id., at 554\u2013\n555 (dissenting opinion).\n   Thus, a requirement that a person pay money to repair\npublic wetlands is not a taking. Such an order does not\naffect a \u201cspecific and identified propert[y] or property\nright[ ]\u201d; it simply \u201cimposes an obligation to perform an\nact\u201d (the improvement of wetlands) that costs money. Id.,\nat 540\u2013541 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). To be sure, when a\nperson spends money on the government\u2019s behalf, or pays\nmoney directly to the government, it \u201cwill reduce [his] net\nworth\u201d\u2014but that \u201ccan be said of any law which has an\nadverse economic effect\u201d on someone. Id., at 543. Because\nthe government is merely imposing a \u201cgeneral liability\u201d\nto pay money, id., at 555 (BREYER, J., dissenting)\u2014and\ntherefore is \u201cindifferent as to how the regulated entity\nelects to comply or the property it uses to do so,\u201d id., at 540\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\u2014the order to repair wetlands,\nviewed independent of the permitting process, does not\nconstitute a taking. And that means the order does not\ntrigger the Nollan-Dolan test, because it does not force\nKoontz to relinquish a constitutional right.\n   The majority tries to distinguish Apfel by asserting that\nthe District\u2019s demand here was \u201cclosely analogous\u201d (and\n\u201cbears resemblance\u201d) to the seizure of a lien on property or\nan income stream from a parcel of land.

When the government dissolves a\nlien, or appropriates a determinate income stream from a\npiece of property\u2014or, for that matter, seizes a particular\n\u201cbank account or [the] accrued interest\u201d on it\u2014the gov-\nernment indeed takes a \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cidentified prop-\nerty interest.\u201d Apfel, 524 U. S., at 540\u2013541 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). But nothing like that occurred here. The\nDistrict did not demand any particular lien, or bank ac-\ncount, or income stream from property. It just ordered\nKoontz to spend or pay money (again, assuming it ordered\nanything at all). Koontz\u2019s liability would have been the\nsame whether his property produced income or not\u2014e.g.,\neven if all he wanted to build was a family home. And\nsimilarly, Koontz could meet that obligation from what-\never source he chose\u2014a checking account, shares of stock, a\nwealthy uncle; the District was \u201cindifferent as to how [he]\nelect[ed] to [pay] or the property [he] use[d] to do so.\u201d Id.,\nat 540. No more than in Apfel, then, was the (supposed)\ndemand here for a \u201cspecific and identified\u201d piece of property,\nwhich the government could not take without paying for\nit. Id., at 541.\n   The majority thus falls back on the sole way the Dis-\ntrict\u2019s alleged demand related to a property interest: The\ndemand arose out of the permitting process for Koontz\u2019s\nland. See ante, at 16\u201317. But under the analytic frame-\nwork that Nollan and Dolan established, that connection\nalone is insufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. As I\nhave described, the heightened standard of Nollan and\nDolan is not a freestanding protection for land-use permit\napplicants; rather, it is \u201ca special application of the doc-\ntrine of unconstitutional conditions, which provides that\nthe government may not require a person to give up a\n8               KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                     MANAGEMENT DIST.                                         \n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nconstitutional right\u2014here the right to receive just com-\npensation when property is taken\u201d\u2014in exchange for a\nland-use permit. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 547 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted); see supra, at 3\u20135. As such, Nollan\nand Dolan apply only if the demand at issue would have\nviolated the Constitution independent of that proposed\nexchange. Or put otherwise, those cases apply only if the\ndemand would have constituted a taking when executed\noutside the permitting process. And here, under Apfel, it\nwould not.1\n   The majority\u2019s approach, on top of its analytic flaws,\nthreatens significant practical harm. By applying Nollan\nand Dolan to permit conditions requiring monetary\npayments\u2014with no express limitation except as to taxes\u2014\nthe majority extends the Takings Clause, with its notoriously\n\u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cperplexing\u201d standards, into the very heart\nof local land-use regulation and service delivery. 524\nU.

That doctrine applies only if imposing a condition directly\u2014\ni.e., independent of an exchange for a government benefit\u2014would\nviolate the Constitution. Here, Apfel makes clear that the District\u2019s\ncondition would not do so: The government may (separate and apart\nfrom permitting) require a person\u2014whether Koontz or anyone else\u2014to\npay or spend money without effecting a taking. The majority offers no\ntheory to the contrary: It does not explain, as it must, why the District\u2019s\ncondition was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Still\nothers are meant to limit the number of landowners who\nengage in a certain activity, as fees for liquor licenses do.\nSee, e.g., Phillips v. Mobile, 208 U.

All now must meet Nollan and Dolan\u2019s nexus\nand proportionality tests. The Federal Constitution thus\nwill decide whether one town is overcharging for sewage,\nor another is setting the price to sell liquor too high. And\nthe flexibility of state and local governments to take the\nmost routine actions to enhance their communities will\ndiminish accordingly.\n   That problem becomes still worse because the majority\u2019s\ndistinction between monetary \u201cexactions\u201d and taxes is so\nhard to apply. Ante, at 18. The majority acknowledges, as\nit must, that taxes are not takings. See ibid. (This case\n\u201cdoes not affect the ability of governments to impose prop-\nerty taxes, user fees, and similar laws and regulations\nthat may impose financial burdens on property owners\u201d).\nBut once the majority decides that a simple demand to pay\nmoney\u2014the sort of thing often viewed as a tax\u2014can count\nas an impermissible \u201cexaction,\u201d how is anyone to tell the\ntwo apart?

The majority might, for example, ap-\nprove the rule, adopted in several States, that Nollan and\nDolan apply only to permitting fees that are imposed\nad hoc, and not to fees that are generally applicable. See,\ne.g., Ehrlich v. Culver City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456101\"><a href=\"/cal/8sRc/ehrlich-v-city-of-culver-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 911 P. 2d 429\n(1996).

Ante, at 15. But that is a prophylaxis in\nsearch of a problem. No one has presented evidence that\nin the many States declining to apply heightened scrutiny\nto permitting fees, local officials routinely short-circuit\nNollan and Dolan to extort the surrender of real property\ninterests having no relation to a development\u2019s costs. See,\ne.g., Krupp v. Breckenridge Sanitation Dist., 19 P. 3d, at\n697; Home Builders Assn. of Central Arizona v.

See, e.g.,\nNorwood v. Baker, 172 U. S. 269 (1898) (preventing cir-\ncumvention of the Takings Clause by prohibiting the\ngovernment from imposing a special assessment for the\nfull value of a property in advance of condemning it). That\nsituation does not call for a rule extending, as the majori-\nty\u2019s does, to all monetary exactions. Finally, a court can\nuse the Penn Central framework, the Due Process Clause,\nand (in many places) state law to protect against monetary\ndemands, whether or not imposed to evade Nollan and\nDolan, that simply \u201cgo[ ] too far.\u201d Mahon, 260 U. S., at\n415; see supra, at 3.3\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Our Penn Central test protects against regulations that unduly\n\nburden an owner\u2019s use of his property: Unlike the Nollan-Dolan stand-\nard, that framework fits to a T a complaint (like Koontz\u2019s) that a\npermitting condition makes it inordinately expensive to develop land.\nAnd the Due Process Clause provides an additional backstop against\nexcessive permitting fees by preventing a government from condition-\ning a land-use permit on a monetary requirement that is \u201cbasically\n12             KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                    MANAGEMENT DIST.                                    \n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\n   In sum, Nollan and Dolan restrain governments from\nusing the permitting process to do what the Takings\nClause would otherwise prevent\u2014i.e., take a specific\nproperty interest without just compensation. Those cases\nhave no application when governments impose a general\nfinancial obligation as part of the permitting process,\nbecause under Apfel such an action does not otherwise\ntrigger the Takings Clause\u2019s protections. By extending\nNollan and Dolan\u2019s heightened scrutiny to a simple pay-\nment demand, the majority threatens the heartland of\nlocal land-use regulation and service delivery, at a bare\nminimum depriving state and local governments of \u201cneces-\nsary predictability.\u201d Apfel, 524 U. S., at 542 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). That decision is unwarranted\u2014and deeply\nunwise. I would keep Nollan and Dolan in their intended\nsphere and affirm the Florida Supreme Court.\n                           II\n  I also would affirm the judgment below for two inde-\npendent reasons, even assuming that a demand for money\ncan trigger Nollan and Dolan. First, the District never\ndemanded that Koontz give up anything (including money)\nas a condition for granting him a permit.4 And second,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\narbitrary.\u201d Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 557\u2013558 (1998)\n(BREYER, J., dissenting). My point is not, as the majority suggests, that\nthese constraints do the same thing as Nollan and Dolan, and so make\nthose decisions unnecessary. See ante, at 21. To the contrary, Nollan\nand Dolan provide developers with enhanced protection (and localities\nwith correspondingly reduced flexibility). See supra, at 8. The question\nhere has to do not with \u201coverruling\u201d those cases, but with extending\nthem. Ante, at 21. My argument is that our prior caselaw struck the\nright balance: heightened scrutiny when the government uses the\npermitting process to demand property that the Takings Clause pro-\ntects, and lesser scrutiny, but a continuing safeguard against abuse,\nwhen the government\u2019s demand is for something falling outside that\nClause\u2019s scope.\n  4 The Court declines to consider whether the District demanded any-\n\nthing from Koontz because the Florida Supreme Court did not reach the\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    13\n\n                          KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nbecause (as everyone agrees) no actual taking occurred,\nKoontz cannot claim just compensation even had the\nDistrict made a demand. The majority nonetheless re-\nmands this case on the theory that Koontz might still be\nentitled to money damages. I cannot see how, and so\nwould spare the Florida courts.\n                              A\n  Nollan and Dolan apply only when the government\nmakes a \u201cdemand[ ]\u201d that a landowner turn over property\nin exchange for a permit. Lingle, 544 U. S., at 546. I\nunderstand the majority to agree with that proposition:\nAfter all, the entire unconstitutional conditions doctrine,\nas the majority notes, rests on the fear that the govern-\nment may use its control over benefits (like permits) to\n\u201ccoerc[e]\u201d a person into giving up a constitutional right.\nAnte, at 7; see ante, at 13. A Nollan-Dolan claim therefore\ndepends on a showing of government coercion, not rele-\nvant in an ordinary challenge to a permit denial. See\nMonterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U. S.\n687, 703 (1999) (Nollan and Dolan were \u201cnot designed to\naddress, and [are] not readily applicable to,\u201d a claim based\non the mere \u201cdenial of [a] development\u201d permit). Before\napplying Nollan and Dolan, a court must find that the\npermit denial occurred because the government made a\ndemand of the landowner, which he rebuffed.\n  And unless Nollan and Dolan are to wreck land-use\npermitting throughout the country\u2014to the detriment of\nboth communities and property owners\u2014that demand\nmust be unequivocal. If a local government risked a law-\nsuit every time it made a suggestion to an applicant about\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nissue. See ante, at 13. But because the District raised this issue in its\nbrief opposing certiorari, Brief in Opposition 14\u201318, both parties briefed\nand argued it on the merits, see Brief for Respondent 37\u201343; Reply\nBrief 7\u20138, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7\u201312, 27\u201328, 52\u201353, and it provides yet\nanother ground to affirm the judgment below, I address the question.\n14           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                              \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nhow to meet permitting criteria, it would cease to do so;\nindeed, the government might desist altogether from\ncommunicating with applicants. That hazard is to some\nextent baked into Nollan and Dolan; observers have won-\ndered whether those decisions have inclined some local\ngovernments to deny permit applications outright, rather\nthan negotiate agreements that could work to both\nsides\u2019 advantage. See W. Fischel, Regulatory Takings 346\n(1995). But that danger would rise exponentially if some-\nthing less than a clear condition\u2014if each idea or proposal\noffered in the back-and-forth of reconciling diverse inter-\nests\u2014triggered Nollan-Dolan scrutiny. At that point,\nno local government official with a decent lawyer would\nhave a conversation with a developer. Hence the need\nto reserve Nollan and Dolan, as we always have, for re-\nviewing only what an official demands, not all he says in\nnegotiations.\n   With that as backdrop, consider how this case arose. To\narrest the loss of the State\u2019s rapidly diminishing wetlands,\nFlorida law prevents landowners from filling or draining\nany such property without two permits. See ante, at 2\u20133.\nKoontz\u2019s property qualifies as a wetland, and he therefore\nneeded the permits to embark on development. His appli-\ncations, however, failed the District\u2019s preliminary review:\nThe District found that they did not preserve wetlands or\nprotect fish and wildlife to the extent Florida law required.\nSee App. Exh. 19\u201320, 47. At that point, the District could\nsimply have denied the applications; had it done so, the\nPenn Central test\u2014not Nollan and Dolan\u2014would have\ngoverned any takings claim Koontz might have brought.\nSee Del Monte Dunes, 526 U. S., at 702\u2013703.\n   Rather than reject the applications, however, the Dis-\ntrict suggested to Koontz ways he could modify them to\nmeet legal requirements. The District proposed reducing\nthe development\u2019s size or modifying its design to lessen\nthe impact on wetlands. See App. Exh. 87\u201388, 91\u201392.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                      KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nAlternatively, the District raised several options for \u201coff-\nsite mitigation\u201d that Koontz could undertake in a nearby\nnature preserve, thus compensating for the loss of wet-\nlands his project would cause. Id., at 90\u201391. The District\nnever made any particular demand respecting an off-site\nproject (or anything else); as Koontz testified at trial, that\npossibility was presented only in broad strokes, \u201c[n]ot in\nany great detail.\u201d App. 103. And the District made clear\nthat it welcomed additional proposals from Koontz to\nmitigate his project\u2019s damage to wetlands. See id., at 75.\nEven at the final hearing on his applications, the District\nasked Koontz if he would \u201cbe willing to go back with the\nstaff over the next month and renegotiate this thing and\ntry to come up with\u201d a solution. Id., at 37. But Koontz\nrefused, saying (through his lawyer) that the proposal he\nsubmitted was \u201cas good as it can get.\u201d Id., at 41. The\nDistrict therefore denied the applications, consistent with\nits original view that they failed to satisfy Florida law.\n   In short, the District never made a demand or set a\ncondition\u2014not to cede an identifiable property interest,\nnot to undertake a particular mitigation project, not even\nto write a check to the government. Instead, the District\nsuggested to Koontz several non-exclusive ways to make\nhis applications conform to state law. The District\u2019s only\nhard-and-fast requirement was that Koontz do something\u2014\nanything\u2014to satisfy the relevant permitting criteria.\nKoontz\u2019s failure to obtain the permits therefore did not\nresult from his refusal to accede to an allegedly extortionate\ndemand or condition; rather, it arose from the legal deficien-\ncies of his applications, combined with his unwillingness\nto correct them by any means. Nollan and Dolan were\nnever meant to address such a run-of-the-mill denial of a\nland-use permit. As applications of the unconstitutional\nconditions doctrine, those decisions require a condition;\nand here, there was none.\n   Indeed, this case well illustrates the danger of extending\n16           KOONTZ v.

Consider\nthe matter from the standpoint of the District\u2019s lawyer.\nThe District, she learns, has found that Koontz\u2019s permit\napplications do not satisfy legal requirements. It can\ndeny the permits on that basis; or it can suggest ways for\nKoontz to bring his applications into compliance. If every\nsuggestion could become the subject of a lawsuit under\nNollan and Dolan, the lawyer can give but one recommen-\ndation: Deny the permits, without giving Koontz any\nadvice\u2014even if he asks for guidance. As the Florida Su-\npreme Court observed of this case: Were Nollan and Dolan\nto apply, the District would \u201copt to simply deny permits\noutright without discussion or negotiation rather than risk\nthe crushing costs of litigation\u201d; and property owners\nlike Koontz then would \u201chave no opportunity to amend\ntheir applications or discuss mitigation options.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (2011).

I would therefore hold that the District\ndid not impose an unconstitutional condition\u2014because it\ndid not impose a condition at all.\n                               B\n   And finally, a third difficulty: Even if (1) money counted\nas \u201cspecific and identified propert[y]\u201d under Apfel (though\nit doesn\u2019t), and (2) the District made a demand for it\n(though it didn\u2019t), (3) Koontz never paid a cent, so the\nDistrict took nothing from him. As I have explained, that\nthird point does not prevent Koontz from suing to invali-\ndate the purported demand as an unconstitutional condi-\ntion. See supra, at 1\u20132. But it does mean, as the majority\nagrees, that Koontz is not entitled to just compensation\nunder the Takings Clause. See ante, at 11. He may obtain\nmonetary relief under the Florida statute he invoked only\nif it authorizes damages beyond just compensation for a\ntaking.\n   The majority remands that question to the Florida\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     KAGAN, J., dissenting\n\nSupreme Court, and given how it disposes of the other\nissues here, I can understand why. As the majority indi-\ncates, a State could decide to create a damages remedy not\nonly for a taking, but also for an unconstitutional condi-\ntions claim predicated on the Takings Clause. And that\nquestion is one of state law, which we usually do well to\nleave to state courts.\n   But as I look to the Florida statute here, I cannot help\nbut see yet another reason why the Florida Supreme\nCourt got this case right. That statute authorizes damages\nonly for \u201can unreasonable exercise of the state\u2019s police\npower constituting a taking without just compensation.\u201d\nFla. Stat. \u00a7373.617 (2010); see ante, at 12. In what legal\nuniverse could a law authorizing damages only for a \u201ctak-\ning\u201d also provide damages when (as all agree) no taking\nhas occurred? I doubt that inside-out, upside-down uni-\nverse is the State of Florida. Certainly, none of the\nFlorida courts in this case suggested that the majority\u2019s\nhypothesized remedy actually exists; rather, the trial and\nappellate courts imposed a damages remedy on the mis-\ntaken theory that there had been a taking (although of\nexactly what neither was clear). See App. to Pet. for Cert.\nC\u20132; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635309\"><a href=\"/fladistctapp/9o7Z/st-johns-river-water-management-v-koontz/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (2009). So I would, once more, affirm\nthe Florida Supreme Court, not make it say again what it\nhas already said\u2014that Koontz is not entitled to money\ndamages.\n                            III\n  Nollan and Dolan are important decisions, designed to\ncurb governments from using their power over land-use\npermitting to extract for free what the Takings Clause\nwould otherwise require them to pay for. But for no fewer\nthan three independent reasons, this case does not present\nthat problem. First and foremost, the government com-\nmits a taking only when it appropriates a specific property\ninterest, not when it requires a person to pay or spend\n18           KOONTZ v. ST. JOHNS RIVER WATER\n\n                  MANAGEMENT DIST.                          \n\n                   KAGAN, J., dissenting \n\n\nmoney. Here, the District never took or threatened\nsuch an interest; it tried to extract from Koontz solely a\ncommitment to spend money to repair public wetlands.\nSecond, Nollan and Dolan can operate only when the\ngovernment makes a demand of the permit applicant;\nthe decisions\u2019 prerequisite, in other words, is a condition.\nHere, the District never made such a demand: It informed\nKoontz that his applications did not meet legal require-\nments; it offered suggestions for bringing those applica-\ntions into compliance; and it solicited further proposals\nfrom Koontz to achieve the same end. That is not the stuff\nof which an unconstitutional condition is made. And\nthird, the Florida statute at issue here does not, in any\nevent, offer a damages remedy for imposing such a condi-\ntion. It provides relief only for a consummated taking,\nwhich did not occur here.\n   The majority\u2019s errors here are consequential. The ma-\njority turns a broad array of local land-use regulations into\nfederal constitutional questions. It deprives state and\nlocal governments of the flexibility they need to enhance\ntheir communities\u2014to ensure environmentally sound and\neconomically productive development. It places courts\nsmack in the middle of the most everyday local govern-\nment activity. As those consequences play out across the\ncountry, I believe the Court will rue today\u2019s decision. I\nrespectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
