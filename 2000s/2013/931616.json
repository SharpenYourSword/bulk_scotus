Argued April 16, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which establishes feder-\n  al standards for state-court child custody proceedings involving Indi-\n  an children, was enacted to address \u201cthe consequences . . . of abusive\n  child welfare practices that [separated] Indian children from their\n  families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usual-\n  ly in non-Indian homes,\u201d Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\n  Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32. As relevant here, the ICWA bars involun-\n  tary termination of a parent\u2019s rights in the absence of a heightened\n  showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from\n  the parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of the child, 25 U. S. C. \u00a71912(f);\n  conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to\n  an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to\n  prevent the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family,\u201d \u00a71912(d); and provides\n  placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members\n  of the child\u2019s extended family, other members of the Indian child\u2019s\n  tribe, and other Indian families, \u00a71915(a).\n     While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Father\u2019s child,\n  their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the\n  Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth\n  Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption\n  agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South\n  Carolina. For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four\n  months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Biological Father provided no finan-\n  cial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl. About four months after\n  Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with no-\n  tice of the pending adoption. In the adoption proceedings, Biological\n  Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adop-\n  tion. Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two\n2                  ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple\u2019s\n    adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father. At the\n    age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father,\n    whom she had never met. The State Supreme Court affirmed, con-\n    cluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding\n    related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a \u201cparent\u201d un-\n    der the ICWA; that \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his\n    parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s\n    adoption-placement preferences would have applied.\nHeld:\n    1. Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a\n \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA, neither \u00a71912(f) nor \u00a71912(d) bars the\n termination of his parental rights. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the\n parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody of the child.\u201d The adjective \u201ccontinued\u201d\n plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary defini-\n tions. The phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d thus refers to custody that a\n parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a\n result, \u00a71912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had\n custody of the Indian child. This reading comports with the statutory\n text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to\n counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian\n families. See \u00a71901(4). But the ICWA\u2019s primary goal is not implicat-\n ed when an Indian child\u2019s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initi-\n ated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights. Nonbinding\n guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate\n that the BIA envisioned that \u00a71912(f)\u2019s standard would apply only to\n termination of a custodial parent\u2019s rights. Under this reading, Bio-\n logical Father should not have been able to invoke \u00a71912(f) in this\n case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl\n as of the time of the adoption proceedings. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (b) Section \u00a71912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing \u201cthat active\n efforts have been made to provide remedial services . . . designed to\n prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have\n proved unsuccessful.\u201d Consistent with this text, \u00a71912(d) applies on-\n ly when an Indian family\u2019s \u201cbreakup\u201d would be precipitated by termi-\n nating parental rights. The term \u201cbreakup\u201d refers in this context to\n \u201c[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,\u201d American Heritage Diction-\n ary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or \u201can ending as an effective entity,\u201d Webster\u2019s\n Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961). But when an Indian\n parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has\n never been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody, there is\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  no \u201crelationship\u201d to be \u201cdiscontinu[ed]\u201d and no \u201ceffective entity\u201d to be\n  \u201cend[ed]\u201d by terminating the Indian parent\u2019s rights. In such a situa-\n  tion, the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d has long since occurred, and\n  \u00a71912(d) is inapplicable. This interpretation is consistent with the\n  explicit congressional purpose of setting certain \u201cstandards for the\n  removal of Indian children from their families,\u201d \u00a71902, and with BIA\n  Guidelines. Section 1912(d)\u2019s proximity to \u00a7\u00a71912(e) and (f), which\n  both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian\n  child\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d with his parent, strongly suggests that\n  the phrase \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d should be read in harmony\n  with the \u201ccontinued custody\u201d requirement. Pp. 11\u201314.\n     2. Section 1915(a)\u2019s adoption-placement preferences are inapplica-\n  ble in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt\n  the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby\n  Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Bio-\n  logical Father is not covered by \u00a71915(a) because he did not seek to\n  adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should\n  not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought\n  by Baby Girl\u2019s paternal grandparents, other members of the Chero-\n  kee Nation, or other Indian families. Pp. 14\u201316.\n398 S. C. 625, 731 S.

The\nprovisions of the federal statute at issue here do not de-\nmand this result.\n   Contrary to the State Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we hold\nthat 25 U. S. C. \u00a71912(f )\u2014which bars involuntary termi-\nnation of a parent\u2019s rights in the absence of a heightened\nshowing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to\nresult from the parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of the child\u2014\ndoes not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never\nhad custody of the child. We further hold that \u00a71912(d)\u2014\nwhich conditions involuntary termination of parental\n2                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that\nremedial efforts have been made to prevent the \u201cbreakup\nof the Indian family\u201d\u2014is inapplicable when, as here, the\nparent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never\nhad custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that \u00a71915(a),\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adoption of\nIndian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like\nAdoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no\nother eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.\nWe accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\n                             I\n   \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat.\n3069, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71901\u20131963, was the product of rising\nconcern in the mid-1970\u2019s over the consequences to In-\ndian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive\nchild welfare practices that resulted in the separation of\nlarge numbers of Indian children from their families and\ntribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually\nin non-Indian homes.\u201d Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indi-\nans v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32 (1989). Congress found\nthat \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families\n[were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted,\nof their children from them by nontribal public and\nprivate agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4). This \u201cwholesale removal of\nIndian children from their homes\u201d prompted Congress to\nenact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that\ngovern state-court child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children. Id., at 32, 36 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also \u00a71902 (declaring that the ICWA es-\ntablishes \u201cminimum Federal standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families\u201d).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the\n\nICWA because she is an unmarried minor who \u201cis eligible for member-\nship in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three provisions of the ICWA are especially relevant to\nthis case. First, \u201c[a]ny party seeking\u201d an involuntary\ntermination of parental rights to an Indian child under\nstate law must demonstrate that \u201cactive efforts have\nbeen made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative\nprograms designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d\n\u00a71912(d). Second, a state court may not involuntarily\nterminate parental rights to an Indian child \u201cin the ab-\nsence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert\nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d \u00a71912(f ).\nThird, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian\nchild under state law, \u201ca preference shall be given, in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with\n(1) a member of the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other\nmembers of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian\nfamilies.\u201d \u00a71915(a).\n                            II\n  In this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly His-\npanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the\nCherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.\nOne month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Fa-\nther, who lived about four hours away, that she was preg-\nnant. After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nIndian tribe,\u201d \u00a71903(4)(b). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 1, 51, \n\nn. 22; Brief for Respondent Cherokee Nation 1; Brief for Petitioners 44\n(\u201cBaby Girl\u2019s eligibility for membership in the Cherokee Nation de-\npends solely upon a lineal blood relationship with a tribal ancestor\u201d).\nIt is also undisputed that the present case concerns a \u201cchild custody\nproceeding,\u201d which the ICWA defines to include proceedings that\ninvolve \u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d and \u201cadoptive placement,\u201d\n\u00a71903(1).\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.\nHe also refused to provide any financial support until after\nthe two had married. The couple\u2019s relationship deteriorated,\nand Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.\nIn June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text mes-\nsage asking if he would rather pay child support or re-\nlinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded\nvia text message that he relinquished his rights.\n   Birth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adop-\ntion. Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Fa-\nther had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted\nthe Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological\nFather was formally enrolled. The inquiry letter mis-\nspelled Biological Father\u2019s first name and incorrectly\nstated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded\nthat, based on the information provided, it could not verify\nBiological Father\u2019s membership in the tribal records.\n   Working through a private adoption agency, Birth\nMother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in\nSouth Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl. Adoptive Couple\nsupported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially\nthroughout her pregnancy. Adoptive Couple was present\nat Baby Girl\u2019s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009,\nand Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord. The\nnext morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing\nher parental rights and consenting to the adoption. Adop-\ntive Couple initiated adoption proceedings in South Caro-\nlina a few days later, and returned there with Baby Girl.\nAfter returning to South Carolina, Adoptive Couple al-\nlowed Birth Mother to visit and communicate with Baby\nGirl.\n   It is undisputed that, for the duration of the pregnancy\nand the first four months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Biologi-\ncal Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother\nor Baby Girl, even though he had the ability to do so. In-\ndeed, Biological Father \u201cmade no meaningful attempts\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto assume his responsibility of parenthood\u201d during this\nperiod. App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (Sealed; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Approximately four months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth,\nAdoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of\nthe pending adoption. (This was the first notification\nthat they had provided to Biological Father regarding\nthe adoption proceeding.) Biological Father signed papers\nstating that he accepted service and that he was \u201cnot\ncontesting the adoption.\u201d App. 37. But Biological Father\nlater testified that, at the time he signed the papers, he\nthought that he was relinquishing his rights to Birth\nMother, not to Adoptive Couple.\n   Biological Father contacted a lawyer the day after sign-\ning the papers, and subsequently requested a stay of the\nadoption proceedings.2 In the adoption proceedings, Bio-\nlogical Father sought custody and stated that he did not\nconsent to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption. Moreover, Biological\nFather took a paternity test, which verified that he was\nBaby Girl\u2019s biological father.\n   A trial took place in the South Carolina Family Court in\nSeptember 2011, by which time Baby Girl was two years\nold. 398 S. C. 625, 634\u2013635, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 555\u2013556\n(2012). The Family Court concluded that Adoptive Couple\nhad not carried the heightened burden under \u00a71912(f ) of\nproving that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional or\nphysical damage if Biological Father had custody. See id.,\nat 648\u2013651, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562\u2013564. The Family Court\ntherefore denied Adoptive Couple\u2019s petition for adoption\nand awarded custody to Biological Father. Id., at 629,\n636, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552, 556. On December 31, 2011, at\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Around  the same time, the Cherokee Nation identified Biological\nFather as a registered member and concluded that Baby Girl was an\n\u201cIndian child\u201d as defined in the ICWA. The Cherokee Nation inter-\nvened in the litigation approximately three months later.\n6               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Bio-\nlogical Father, whom she had never met.3\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Family\nCourt\u2019s denial of the adoption and the award of custody to\nBiological Father. Id., at 629, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552. The\nState Supreme Court first determined that the ICWA\napplied because the case involved a child custody proceed-\ning relating to an Indian child. Id., at 637, 643, n. 18, 731\nS. E. 2d, at 556, 560, n. 18. It also concluded that Biologi-\ncal Father fell within the ICWA\u2019s definition of a \u201c \u2018parent.\u2019 \u201d\nId., at 644, 731 S. E. 2d, at 560. The court then held that\ntwo separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termina-\ntion of Biological Father\u2019s parental rights. First, the court\nheld that Adoptive Couple had not shown that \u201cactive\nefforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof the Indian family.\u201d \u00a71912(d); see also id., at 647\u2013648,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 562. Second, the court concluded that\nAdoptive Couple had not shown that Biological Father\u2019s\n\u201ccustody of Baby Girl would result in serious emotional or\nphysical harm to her beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., at\n648\u2013649, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562\u2013563 (citing \u00a71912(f )). Finally,\nthe court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate\nBiological Father\u2019s parental rights, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s adoption-\nplacement preferences would have applied. Id., at 655\u2013657,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 566\u2013567. We granted certiorari. 568 U.

E. 2d, at\n560, n. 19 (\u201cUnder state law, [Biological] Father\u2019s con-\nsent to the adoption would not have been required\u201d). The\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court held, however, that Biolog-\nical Father is a \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA and that two\nstatutory provisions\u2014namely, \u00a71912(f ) and \u00a71912(d)\u2014bar\nthe termination of his parental rights. In this Court,\nAdoptive Couple contends that Biological Father is not a\n\u201cparent\u201d and that \u00a71912(f ) and \u00a71912(d) are inapplicable.\nWe need not\u2014and therefore do not\u2014decide whether Bio-\nlogical Father is a \u201cparent.\u201d See \u00a71903(9) (defining \u201cpar-\nent\u201d).4 Rather, assuming for the sake of argument that he\nis a \u201cparent,\u201d we hold that neither \u00a71912(f ) nor \u00a71912(d)\nbars the termination of his parental rights.\n                              A\n   Section 1912(f ) addresses the involuntary termination\nof parental rights with respect to an Indian child. Specifi-\ncally, \u00a71912(f ) provides that \u201c[n]o termination of parental\nrights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of\na determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasona-\nble doubt, . . . that the continued custody of the child by\nthe parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) The South Carolina Supreme Court held that\nAdoptive Couple failed to satisfy \u00a71912(f ) because they did\nnot make a heightened showing that Biological Father\u2019s\n\u201cprospective legal and physical custody\u201d would likely result\nin serious damage to the child. 398 S. C., at 651, 731 S. E.\n2d, at 564 (emphasis added). That holding was error.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 If Biological Father is not a \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA, then \u00a71912(f )\n\nand \u00a71912(d)\u2014which relate to proceedings involving possible termina-\ntion of \u201cparental\u201d rights\u2014are inapplicable. Because we conclude that\nthese provisions are inapplicable for other reasons, however, we need\nnot decide whether Biological Father is a \u201cparent.\u201d\n8                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Section 1912(f ) conditions the involuntary termination\nof parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of\n\u201ccontinued custody of the child by the parent.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) The adjective \u201ccontinued\u201d plainly refers to a pre-\nexisting state. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concedes, post, at\n11 (dissenting opinion) (hereinafter the dissent), \u201ccontin-\nued\u201d means \u201c[c]arried on or kept up without cessation\u201d\nor \u201c[e]xtended in space without interruption or breach of\nconne[ct]ion.\u201d Compact Edition of the Oxford English\nDictionary 909 (1981 reprint of 1971 ed.)

The term \u201ccontinued\u201d\nalso can mean \u201cresumed after interruption.\u201d Webster\u2019s\n493; see American Heritage Dictionary 288. The phrase\n\u201ccontinued custody\u201d therefore refers to custody that a\nparent already has (or at least had at some point in the\npast). As a result, \u00a71912(f ) does not apply in cases where\nthe Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.5\n  Biological Father\u2019s contrary reading of \u00a71912(f ) is non-\nsensical.

A biological father\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of a child cannot be\nassessed if the father never had custody at all, and the use of a differ-\nent phrase\u2014\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d\u2014cannot change that. In\naddition, the dissent\u2019s reliance on subsection headings, post, at 9,\noverlooks the fact that those headings were not actually enacted by\nCongress.

But it would be absurd to\nthink that Congress enacted a provision that permits\ntermination of a custodial parent\u2019s rights, while simulta-\nneously prohibiting termination of a noncustodial parent\u2019s\nrights. If the statute draws any distinction between\ncustodial and noncustodial parents, that distinction\nsurely does not provide greater protection for noncustodial\nparents.6\n   Our reading of \u00a71912(f ) comports with the statutory text\ndemonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was\ndesigned to counteract was the unwarranted removal of\nIndian children from Indian families due to the cultural\ninsensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.\nThe statutory text expressly highlights the primary prob-\nlem that the statute was intended to solve: \u201can alarmingly\nhigh percentage of Indian families [were being] broken up\nby the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from\nthem by nontribal public and private agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4)\n(emphasis added); see also \u00a71902 (explaining that the\nICWA establishes \u201cminimum Federal standards for the\nremoval of Indian children from their families\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Holyfield, 490 U.

As an initial\nmatter, it is undisputed that Biological Father never had\nphysical custody of Baby Girl. And as a matter of both\nSouth Carolina and Oklahoma law, Biological Father\nnever had legal custody either. See S. C.

See post, at 17\u201318, and n. 12 (emphasis\nadded). This is entirely beside the point, because we merely conclude\nthat, based on the statute\u2019s text and structure, Congress did not extend\nthe heightened protections of \u00a71912(d) and \u00a71912(f ) to all biological\nfathers. The fact that state laws may provide certain protections to\nbiological fathers who have abandoned their children and who have\nnever had custody of their children in no way undermines our analysis\nof these two federal statutory provisions.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

The South Carolina Supreme Court\nfound that Biological Father\u2019s parental rights could not\nbe terminated because Adoptive Couple had not demon-\nstrated that Biological Father had been provided remedial\nservices in accordance with \u00a71912(d). 398 S. C., at 647\u2013\n648, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. We disagree.\n   Consistent with the statutory text, we hold that\n\u00a71912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family\u2019s\n\u201cbreakup\u201d would be precipitated by the termination of the\nparent\u2019s rights. The term \u201cbreakup\u201d refers in this context\nto \u201c[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,\u201d American Her-\nitage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or \u201can ending as an\neffective entity,\u201d Webster\u2019s 273 (defining \u201cbreakup\u201d as \u201ca\ndisruption or dissolution into component parts: an ending\nas an effective entity\u201d). See also Compact OED 1076\n(defining \u201cbreak-up\u201d as, inter alia, a \u201cdisruption, separa-\ntion into parts, disintegration\u201d). But when an Indian\nparent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that\nchild has never been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or\nphysical custody, there is no \u201crelationship\u201d that would be\n\u201cdiscontinu[ed]\u201d\u2014and no \u201ceffective entity\u201d that would\nbe \u201cend[ed]\u201d\u2014by the termination of the Indian par-\nent\u2019s rights. In such a situation, the \u201cbreakup of the\nIndian family\u201d has long since occurred, and \u00a71912(d) is\ninapplicable.\n   Our interpretation of \u00a71912(d) is, like our interpretation\nof \u00a71912(f ), consistent with the explicit congressional\npurpose of providing certain \u201cstandards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families.\u201d \u00a71902 (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., \u00a71901(4); Holyfield, 490 U. S., at 32\u2013\n34. In addition, the BIA\u2019s Guidelines confirm that reme-\ndial services under \u00a71912(d) are intended \u201cto alleviate the\nneed to remove the Indian child from his or her parents or\nIndian custodians,\u201d not to facilitate a transfer of the child\nto an Indian parent.

That these three provisions appear adjacent to\neach other strongly suggests that the phrase \u201cbreakup of\nthe Indian family\u201d should be read in harmony with the\n\u201ccontinued custody\u201d requirement. See United Sav. Assn.\nof Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484\nU. S. 365, 371 (1988) (explaining that statutory construc-\ntion \u201cis a holistic endeavor\u201d and that \u201c[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme\u201d). None of these three\nprovisions creates parental rights for unwed fathers where\nno such rights would otherwise exist. Instead, Indian\nparents who are already part of an \u201cIndian family\u201d are\nprovided with access to \u201cremedial services and rehabilita-\ntive programs\u201d under \u00a71912(d) so that their \u201ccustody\u201d\nmight be \u201ccontinued\u201d in a way that avoids foster-care\nplacement under \u00a71912(e) or termination of parental\nrights under \u00a71912(f ). In other words, the provision of\n\u201cremedial services and rehabilitative programs\u201d under\n\u00a71912(d) supports the \u201ccontinued custody\u201d that is protected\nby \u00a71912(e) and \u00a71912(f ).8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent claims that our reasoning \u201cnecessarily extends to all\n\nIndian parents who have never had custody of their children,\u201d even if\nthose parents have visitation rights. Post, at 2\u20133, 13\u201314. As an initial\nmatter, the dissent\u2019s concern about the effect of our decision on individ-\nuals with visitation rights will be implicated, at most, in a relatively\nsmall class of cases. For example, our interpretation of \u00a71912(d) would\nimplicate the dissent\u2019s concern only in the case of a parent who aban-\ndoned his or her child prior to birth and never had physical or legal\ncustody, but did have some sort of visitation rights. Moreover, in cases\nwhere this concern is implicated, such parents might receive \u201ccompara-\nble\u201d protections under state law. See post, at 15. And in any event, it is\nthe dissent\u2019s interpretation that would have far-reaching consequences:\n14               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 1912(d) is a sensible requirement when applied\nto state social workers who might otherwise be too quick\nto remove Indian children from their Indian families. It\nwould, however, be unusual to apply \u00a71912(d) in the con-\ntext of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to\nbirth and who never had custody of the child. The decision\nbelow illustrates this point. The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt held that \u00a71912(d) mandated measures such as\n\u201cattempting to stimulate [Biological] Father\u2019s desire to be\na parent.\u201d 398 S. C., at 647, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. But if\nprospective adoptive parents were required to engage in\nthe bizarre undertaking of \u201cstimulat[ing]\u201d a biological\nfather\u2019s \u201cdesire to be a parent,\u201d it would surely dissuade\nsome of them from seeking to adopt Indian children.9 And\nthis would, in turn, unnecessarily place vulnerable Indian\nchildren at a unique disadvantage in finding a permanent\nand loving home, even in cases where neither an Indian\nparent nor the relevant tribe objects to the adoption.10\n   In sum, the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in\nfinding that \u00a71912(d) barred termination of Biological\nFather\u2019s parental rights.\n                             IV\n     In the decision below, the South Carolina Supreme\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUnder the dissent\u2019s reading, any biological parent\u2014even a sperm\ndonor\u2014would enjoy the heightened protections of \u00a71912(d) and\n\u00a71912(f ), even if he abandoned the mother and the child immediately\nafter conception.

In so\ndoing, however, the court failed to recognize a critical lim-\nitation on the scope of \u00a71915(a).\n   Section 1915(a) provides that \u201c[i]n any adoptive place-\nment of an Indian child under State law, a preference\nshall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary,\nto a placement with (1) a member of the child\u2019s extended\nfamily; (2) other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or\n(3) other Indian families.\u201d Contrary to the South Carolina\nSupreme Court\u2019s suggestion, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s preferences are\ninapplicable in cases where no alternative party has for-\nmally sought to adopt the child. This is because there\nsimply is no \u201cpreference\u201d to apply if no alternative party\nthat is eligible to be preferred under \u00a71915(a) has come\nforward.\n   In this case, Adoptive Couple was the only party that\nsought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court. See Brief for Petitioners\n19, 55; Brief for Respondent Birth Father 48; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 13. Biological Father is not covered by\n\u00a71915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; in-\nstead, he argued that his parental rights should not be\nterminated in the first place.11 Moreover, Baby Girl\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Section 1915(c) also provides that, in the case of an adoptive place-\nment under \u00a71915(a), \u201cif the Indian child\u2019s tribe shall establish a\ndifferent order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting\nthe placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the\nleast restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child,\nas provided in [\u00a71915(b)].\u201d Although we need not decide the issue\nhere, it may be the case that an Indian child\u2019s tribe could alter \u00a71915\u2019s\npreferences in a way that includes a biological father whose rights were\nterminated, but who has now reformed.

Nor did other members of the\nCherokee Nation or \u201cother Indian families\u201d seek to adopt\nBaby Girl, even though the Cherokee Nation had notice\nof\u2014and intervened in\u2014the adoption proceedings.

As the State Supreme Court read\n\u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ), a biological Indian father could abandon\nhis child in utero and refuse any support for the birth\nmother\u2014perhaps contributing to the mother\u2019s decision to\nput the child up for adoption\u2014and then could play his\nICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the\nmother\u2019s decision and the child\u2019s best interests. If this\nwere possible, many prospective adoptive parents would\nsurely pause before adopting any child who might possibly\nqualify as an Indian under the ICWA. Such an interpreta-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npreference. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a), (c); In re Adoption of T. R. M., 525 N.

However, this testi-\nmony was only a general statement regarding the Cherokee Nation\u2019s\npractices; it did not demonstrate that a specific Indian family was\nwilling to adopt Baby Girl, let alone that such a family formally sought\nsuch adoption in the South Carolina courts.

Each party in this case has put forward a plausible\ninterpretation of the relevant sections of the Indian Child\nWelfare Act (ICWA). However, the interpretations offered\nby respondent Birth Father and the United States raise\nsignificant constitutional problems as applied to this\ncase. Because the Court\u2019s decision avoids those problems,\nI concur in its interpretation.\n                              I\n  This case arises out of a contested state-court adoption\nproceeding. Adoption proceedings are adjudicated in state\nfamily courts across the country every day, and \u201cdomestic\nrelations\u201d is \u201can area that has long been regarded as a\nvirtually exclusive province of the States.\u201d Sosna v.

Nevertheless, when Adoptive Couple filed a\npetition in South Carolina Family Court to finalize their\nadoption of Baby Girl, Birth Father, who had relinquished\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nhis parental rights via a text message to Birth Mother,\nclaimed a federal right under the ICWA to block the adop-\ntion and to obtain custody.\n   The ICWA establishes \u201cfederal standards that govern\nstate-court child custody proceedings involving Indian\nchildren.\u201d Ante, at 2. The ICWA defines \u201cIndian child\u201d as\n\u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible\nfor membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological\nchild of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71903(4).\nAs relevant, the ICWA defines \u201cchild custody proceeding,\u201d\n\u00a71903(1), to include \u201cadoptive placement,\u201d which means\n\u201cthe permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption,\nincluding any action resulting in a final decree of adop-\ntion,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(iv), and \u201ctermination of parental rights,\u201d\nwhich means \u201cany action resulting in the termination of\nthe parent-child relationship,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(ii).\n   The ICWA restricts a state court\u2019s ability to terminate\nthe parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant\nways. Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involun-\ntarily terminating parental rights \u201cin the absence of a\ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\nthat the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or\nphysical damage to the child.\u201d Section 1912(d) prohibits a\nstate court from terminating parental rights until the\ncourt is satisfied \u201cthat active efforts have been made to\nprovide remedial services and rehabilitative programs\ndesigned to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and\nthat these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d A third\nprovision creates specific placement preferences for the\nadoption of Indian children, which favor placement with\nIndians over other adoptive families. \u00a71915(a). Operating\ntogether, these requirements often lead to different out-\ncomes than would result under state law. That is precisely\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See ante, at 6 (\u201cIt is undisputed\nthat, had Baby Girl not been 3/256 Cherokee, Biological\nFather would have had no right to object to her adoption\nunder South Carolina law\u201d).\n   The ICWA recognizes States\u2019 inherent \u201cjurisdiction over\nIndian child custody proceedings,\u201d \u00a71901(5), but asserts\nthat federal regulation is necessary because States \u201chave\noften failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of\nIndian people and the cultural and social standards pre-\nailing in Indian communities and families,\u201d ibid. However,\nCongress may regulate areas of traditional state concern\nonly if the Constitution grants it such power. Admt. 10\n(\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d). The\nthreshold question, then, is whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress power to override state custody law\nwhenever an Indian is involved.\n                              II\n   The ICWA asserts that the Indian Commerce Clause,\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3, and \u201cother constitutional authority\u201d pro-\nvides Congress with \u201cplenary power over Indian affairs.\u201d\n\u00a71901(1). The reference to \u201cother constitutional authority\u201d\nis not illuminating, and I am aware of no other enumer-\nated power that could even arguably support Congress\u2019\nintrusion into this area of traditional state authority. See\nFletcher, The Supreme Court and Federal Indian Policy,\n85 Neb. L.

Although this\nCourt has said that the \u201ccentral function of the Indian\nCommerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary\npower to legislate in the field of Indian affairs,\u201d Cotton\nPetroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.

I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). \u201cAt the time the original\nConstitution was ratified, \u2018commerce\u2019 consisted of selling,\nbuying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these\npurposes.\u201d United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring). See also 1 S.

The term \u201ccommerce\u201d did\nnot include economic activity such as \u201cmanufacturing and\nagriculture,\u201d ibid., let alone noneconomic activity such as\nadoption of children.\n   Furthermore, the term \u201ccommerce with Indian tribes\u201d\nwas invariably used during the time of the founding to\nmean \u201c \u2018trade with Indians.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g., Natelson, 215\u2013216,\nand n. 97 (citing 18th-century sources); Report of Commit-\ntee on Indian Affairs (Feb 20, 1787), in 32 Journals of the\nContinental Congress 1774\u20131789, pp. 66, 68 (R.

And regulation of Indian commerce generally\nreferred to legal structures governing \u201cthe conduct of\nthe merchants engaged in the Indian trade, the nature of the\ngoods they sold, the prices charged, and similar matters.\u201d\nNatelson 216, and n. 99.\n  The Indian Commerce Clause contains an additional\ntextual limitation relevant to this case: Congress is given\nthe power to regulate Commerce \u201cwith the Indian tribes.\u201d\nThe Clause does not give Congress the power to regulate\ncommerce with all Indian persons any more than the\nForeign Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to\nregulate commerce with all foreign nationals traveling\nwithin the United States. A straightforward reading of\nthe text, thus, confirms that Congress may only regulate\ncommercial interactions\u2014\u201ccommerce\u201d\u2014taking place with\nestablished Indian communities\u2014\u201ctribes.\u201d That power is\nfar from \u201cplenary.\u201d\n                              B\n   Congress\u2019 assertion of \u201cplenary power\u201d over Indian\naffairs is also inconsistent with the history of the Indian\nCommerce Clause. At the time of the founding, the Clause\nwas understood to reserve to the States general police\npowers with respect to Indians who were citizens of the\nseveral States. The Clause instead conferred on Congress\nthe much narrower power to regulate trade with Indian\ntribes\u2014that is, Indians who had not been incorporated\ninto the body-politic of any State.\n                             1\n  Before the Revolution, most Colonies adopted their own\nregulations governing Indian trade. See Natelson 219,\nand n. 121 (citing colonial laws). Such regulations were\nnecessary because colonial traders all too often abused\ntheir Indian trading partners, through fraud, exorbitant\nprices, extortion, and physical invasion of Indian territory,\n6                 ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\namong other things. See 1 F. Prucha, The Great Father\n18\u201320 (1984) (hereinafter Prucha); Natelson 220, and\nn. 122. These abuses sometimes provoked violent Indian\nretaliation. See Prucha 20. To mitigate these conflicts,\nmost Colonies extensively regulated traders engaged in\ncommerce with Indian tribes. See e.g., Ordinance to Regu-\nlate Indian Affairs, Statutes of South Carolina (Aug. 31,\n1751), in 16 Early American Indian Documents: Treaties\nand Laws, 1607\u20131789, pp. 331\u2013334 (A. Vaughan and\nD. Rosen eds. 1998).1 Over time, commercial regulation at\nthe colonial level proved largely ineffective, in part be-\ncause \u201c[t]here was no uniformity among the colonies, no\ntwo sets of like regulations.\u201d Prucha 21.\n   Recognizing the need for uniform regulation of trade\nwith the Indians, Benjamin Franklin proposed his own\n\u201carticles of confederation\u201d to the Continental Congress on\nJuly 21, 1775, which reflected his view that central control\nover Indian affairs should predominate over local control.\n2 J. Cont\u2019l Cong. 195\u2013199 (W. Ford ed. 1905). Franklin\u2019s\nproposal was not enacted, but in November 1775, Con-\ngress empowered a committee to draft regulations for\nthe Indian trade. 3 id., at 364, 366. On July 12, 1776, the\ncommittee submitted a draft of the Articles of Confedera-\ntion to Congress, which incorporated many of Franklin\u2019s\nproposals. 5 id., at 545, 546, n. 1.

Some delegates feared\nthat the Articles gave Congress excessive power to in-\nterfere with States\u2019 jurisdiction over affairs with Indians\nresiding within state boundaries. After further delibera-\ntion, the final result was a clause that included a broad\ngrant of congressional authority with two significant\nexceptions: \u201cThe United States in Congress assembled\nshall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of\n. . . regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the\nIndians, not members of any of the States, provided that\nthe legislative right of any State within its own limits be\nnot infringed or violated.\u201d Articles of Confederation, Art.\nIX, cl. 4. As a result, Congress retained exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over Indian affairs outside the borders of the States;\nthe States retained exclusive jurisdiction over relations\nwith Member-Indians;2 and Congress and the States \u201cex-\nercise[d] concurrent jurisdiction over transactions with\ntribal Indians within state boundaries, but congressional\ndecisions would have to be in compliance with local law.\u201d\nNatelson 230.

Rossiter ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison).\n8             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\ntion reveals the delegates\u2019 concern with protecting the\npower of the States to regulate Indian persons who were\npolitically incorporated into the States. This concern\nfor state power reemerged during the drafting of the\nConstitution.\n                              2\n   The drafting history of the Constitutional Convention\nalso supports a limited construction of the Indian Com-\nmerce Clause. On July 24, 1787, the convention elected\na drafting committee\u2014the Committee of Detail\u2014and\ncharged it to \u201creport a Constitution conformable to the Res-\nolutions passed by the Convention.\u201d 2 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M. Farrand rev. 1966)\n(J. Madison). During the Committee\u2019s deliberations, John\nRutledge, the chairman, suggested incorporating an In-\ndian affairs power into the Constitution. Id., at 137, n. 6,\n143. The first draft reported back to the convention,\nhowever, provided Congress with authority \u201c[t]o regulate\ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several\nStates,\u201d id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not\ninclude any specific Indian affairs clause. On August 18,\nJames Madison proposed that the Federal Government be\ngranted several additional powers, including the power\n\u201c[t]o regulate affairs with the Indians as well within as\nwithout the limits of the U. States.\u201d Id., at 324 (J. Madi-\nson) (emphasis added). On August 22, Rutledge delivered\nthe Committee of Detail\u2019s second report, which modified\nMadison\u2019s proposed clause. The Committee proposed to\nadd to Congress\u2019 power \u201c[t]o regulate commerce with\nforeign nations, and among the several States\u201d the words,\n\u201cand with Indians, within the Limits of any State, not\nsubject to the laws thereof.\u201d Id., at 366\u2013367 (Journal).\nThe Committee\u2019s version, which echoed the Articles of\nConfederation, was far narrower than Madison\u2019s proposal.\nOn August 31, the revised draft was submitted to a Com-\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

That Committee recommended adding\nto the Commerce Clause the phrase, \u201cand with the Indian\ntribes,\u201d id., at 493, which the Convention ultimately\nadopted.\n   It is, thus, clear that the Framers of the Constitution\nwere alert to the difference between the power to regulate\ntrade with the Indians and the power to regulate all In-\ndian affairs. By limiting Congress\u2019 power to the former, the\nFramers declined to grant Congress the same broad pow-\ners over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confed-\neration. See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89\nCornell L. Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).\n   During the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian\nCommerce Clause was nearly nonexistent. See Natelson\n248 (noting that Robert Yates, a New York Anti-Federalist\nwas \u201calmost the only writer who objected to any part [of ]\nof the Commerce Clause\u2014a clear indication that its scope\nwas understood to be fairly narrow\u201d (footnote omitted)).\nGiven the Anti-Federalists\u2019 vehement opposition to the\nConstitution\u2019s other grants of power to the Federal Gov-\nernment, this silence is revealing. The ratifiers almost\ncertainly understood the Clause to confer a relatively\nmodest power on Congress\u2014namely, the power to regulate\ntrade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders. And\nthis feature of the Constitution was welcomed by Federal-\nists and Anti-Federalists alike due to the considerable\ninterest in expanding trade with such Indian tribes. See,\ne.g., The Federalist No. 42, at 265 (J. Madison) (praising\nthe Constitution for removing the obstacles that had\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation to federal\ncontrol over \u201ctrade with Indians\u201d (emphasis added)); 3 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 580 (2d ed. 1863)\n(Adam Stephens, at the Virginia ratifying convention,\nJune 23, 1788, describing the Indian tribes residing near\n10            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

There is\nlittle evidence that the ratifiers of the Constitution under-\nstood the Indian Commerce Clause to confer anything\nresembling plenary power over Indian affairs. See Natel-\nson 247\u2013250.\n                            III\n  In light of the original understanding of the Indian\nCommerce Clause, the constitutional problems that would\nbe created by application of the ICWA here are evident.\nFirst, the statute deals with \u201cchild custody proceedings,\u201d\n\u00a71903(1), not \u201ccommerce.\u201d It was enacted in response to\nconcerns that \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian\nfamilies [were] broken up by the removal, often unwar-\nranted, of their children from them by nontribal public\nand private agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4). The perceived problem\nwas that many Indian children were \u201cplaced in non-Indian\nfoster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d Ibid. This\nproblem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.\n  Second, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not\nregulate Indian tribes as tribes. Sections 1912(d) and (f ),\nand \u00a71915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involv-\ning an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe\nis involved. This case thus does not directly implicate\nCongress\u2019 power to \u201clegislate in respect to Indian tribes.\u201d\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (emphasis\nadded). Baby Girl was never domiciled on an Indian\nReservation, and the Cherokee Nation had no jurisdiction\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nover her. Cf. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\nHolyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 53\u201354 (1989) (holding that the\nIndian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody\nproceedings, even though the children were born off the\nreservation, because the children were \u201cdomiciled\u201d on the\nreservation for purposes of the ICWA). Although Birth\nFather is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he\ndid not live on a reservation either. He was, thus, subject\nto the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma)\nand of the State where his daughter resided during the\ncustody proceedings (South Carolina). Nothing in the In-\ndian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact spe-\ncial laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his\nstatus as an Indian.3\n  Because adoption proceedings like this one involve\nneither \u201ccommerce\u201d nor \u201cIndian tribes,\u201d there is simply no\nconstitutional basis for Congress\u2019 assertion of authority\nover such proceedings. Also, the notion that Congress can\ndirect state courts to apply different rules of evidence and\nprocedure merely because a person of Indian descent is\ninvolved raises absurd possibilities. Such plenary power\nwould allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal\nprocedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian\ndefendants. Likewise, it would allow Congress to substi-\ntute federal law for state law when contract disputes\ninvolve Indians. But the Constitution does not grant\nCongress power to override state law whenever that law\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioners and the guardian ad litem contend that applying the\n\nICWA to child custody proceedings on the basis of race implicates equal\nprotection concerns. See Brief for Petitioners 45 (arguing that the\nstatute would be unconstitutional \u201cif unwed fathers with no preexisting\nsubstantive parental rights receive a statutory preference based solely\non the Indian child\u2019s race\u201d); Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem\n48\u201349 (same). I need not address this argument because I am satisfied\nthat Congress lacks authority to regulate the child custody proceedings\nin this case.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

First,\nthe statute does not directly explain how to treat an ab-\nsentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with\nhis child in the first few months of her life. That category\nof fathers may include some who would prove highly un-\nsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range\nof others in between. Most of those who fall within that\ncategory seem to fall outside the scope of the language of\n25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ). Thus, while I agree that the\nbetter reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes,\nto exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also un-\nderstand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.\nSee post, at 13, 22\u201323 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Second, we should decide here no more than is neces-\nsary. Thus, this case does not involve a father with visita-\ntion rights or a father who has paid \u201call of his child\nsupport obligations.\u201d See post, at 13. Neither does it involve\nspecial circumstances such as a father who was deceived\nabout the existence of the child or a father who was pre-\nvented from supporting his child. See post, at 13 n. 8. The\nCourt need not, and in my view does not, now decide\nwhether or how \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ) apply where those cir-\n2              ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncumstances are present.\n  Third, other statutory provisions not now before us may\nnonetheless prove relevant in cases of this kind. Section\n1915(a) grants an adoptive \u201cpreference\u201d to \u201c(1) a member\nof the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other members of the\nIndian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary.\u201d Further, \u00a71915(c)\nallows the \u201cIndian child\u2019s tribe\u201d to \u201cestablish a different\norder of preference by resolution.\u201d Could these provisions\nallow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory\norder of preference with support from the tribe, and sub-\nject to a court\u2019s consideration of \u201cgood cause?\u201d I raise, but\ndo not here try to answer, the question.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I reject the conclusion that the Court draws from\nthe words \u201ccontinued custody\u201d in 25 U. S. C \u00a71912(f) not\nbecause \u201cliteralness may strangle meaning,\u201d see post, at\n11, but because there is no reason that \u201ccontinued\u201d must\nrefer to custody in the past rather than custody in the\nfuture. I read the provision as requiring the court to\nsatisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that\ninitial or temporary custody is not \u201clikely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child,\u201d but\nthat continued custody is not likely to do so. See Web-\nster\u2019s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950)\n(defining \u201ccontinued\u201d as \u201c[p]rotracted in time or space, esp.\nwithout interruption; constant\u201d). For the reasons set forth\nin JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent, that connotation is much\nmore in accord with the rest of the statute.\n  While I am at it, I will add one thought. The Court\u2019s\nopinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of\nparenthood. It has been the constant practice of the com-\nmon law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a\nchild into the world to raise that child. We do not inquire\nwhether leaving a child with his parents is \u201cin the best\ninterest of the child.\u201d It sometimes is not; he would be\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

This father wants to raise\nhis daughter, and the statute amply protects his right to\ndo so. There is no reason in law or policy to dilute that\nprotection.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

In truth, however, the path from the text of\nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to the result the\nCourt reaches is anything but clear, and its result any\u00ad\nthing but right.\n   The reader\u2019s first clue that the majority\u2019s supposedly\nstraightforward reasoning is flawed is that not all Mem\u00ad\nbers who adopt its interpretation believe it is compelled by\nthe text of the statute, see ante, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concur\u00ad\nring); nor are they all willing to accept the consequences\nit will necessarily have beyond the specific factual sce-\nnario confronted here, see ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring).\nThe second clue is that the majority begins its analysis by\nplucking out of context a single phrase from the last clause\nof the last subsection of the relevant provision, and then\nbuilds its entire argument upon it. That is not how we\nordinarily read statutes. The third clue is that the major-\nity openly professes its aversion to Congress\u2019 explicitly\nstated purpose in enacting the statute. The majority ex-\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npresses concern that reading the Act to mean what it\nsays will make it more difficult to place Indian children in\nadoptive homes, see ante, at 14, 16, but the Congress that\nenacted the statute announced its intent to stop \u201can\nalarmingly high percentage of Indian families [from being]\nbroken up\u201d by, among other things, a trend of \u201cplac[ing]\n[Indian children] in non-Indian . . . adoptive homes.\u201d 25\nU. S. C. \u00a71901(4). Policy disagreement with Congress\u2019 judg-\nment is not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro\u00ad\nvisions of the Act. Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt\na reading of ICWA that is contrary to both its text and its\nstated purpose. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  Beginning its reading with the last clause of \u00a71912(f ),\nthe majority concludes that a single phrase appearing\nthere\u2014\u201ccontinued custody\u201d\u2014means that the entirety of\nthe subsection is inapplicable to any parent, however\ncommitted, who has not previously had physical or legal\ncustody of his child. Working back to front, the majority\nthen concludes that \u00a71912(d), tainted by its association\nwith \u00a71912(f ), is also inapplicable; in the majority\u2019s view,\na family bond that does not take custodial form is not a\nfamily bond worth preserving from \u201cbreakup.\u201d Because\nthere are apparently no limits on the contaminating power\nof this single phrase, the majority does not stop there.\nUnder its reading, \u00a71903(9), which makes biological fa\u00ad\nthers \u201cparent[s]\u201d under this federal statute (and where,\nagain, the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d does not appear),\nhas substantive force only when a birth father has physi\u00ad\ncal or state-recognized legal custody of his daughter.\n  When it excludes noncustodial biological fathers from\nthe Act\u2019s substantive protections, this textually backward\nreading misapprehends ICWA\u2019s structure and scope.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s focus on the per-\nceived parental shortcomings of Birth Father, its rea\u00ad\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The majority thereby trans\u00ad\nforms a statute that was intended to provide uniform\nfederal standards for child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children and their biological parents into an illogi\u00ad\ncal piecemeal scheme.\n                               A\n   Better to start at the beginning and consider the opera\u00ad\ntion of the statute as a whole. Cf. ante, at 13 (\u201c[S]tatutory\nconstruction \u2018is a holistic endeavor[,]\u2019 and . . . \u2018[a] provision\nthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by\nthe remainder of the statutory scheme\u2019 \u201d (quoting United\nSav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988))).\n   ICWA commences with express findings. Congress rec\u00ad\nognized that \u201cthere is no resource that is more vital to\nthe continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than\ntheir children,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71901(3), and it found that this\nresource was threatened. State authorities insufficiently\nsensitive to \u201cthe essential tribal relations of Indian people\nand the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian\ncommunities and families\u201d were breaking up Indian fami\u00ad\nlies and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and\ninstitutions. See \u00a7\u00a71901(4)\u2013(5). As \u00a71901(4) makes clear,\nand as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of\nChoctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 33 (1989),\nadoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian\nfamilies contributed significantly to the overall problem. See\n\u00a71901(4) (finding that \u201can alarmingly high percentage of\n[Indian] children are placed in non-Indian . . . adoptive\nhomes\u201d).\n   Consistent with these findings, Congress declared its\npurpose \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nand to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes\nand families by the establishment of minimum Federal\nstandards\u201d applicable to child custody proceedings involv\u00ad\ning Indian children. \u00a71902. Section 1903 then goes on to\nestablish the reach of these protections through its defi-\nnitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these\ndefinitions are crucial to understanding the statute\u2019s full\nscope.\n   First, ICWA defines the term \u201cparent\u201d broadly to mean\n\u201cany biological parent . . . of an Indian child or any In-\ndian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.\u201d\n\u00a71903(9). It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an \u201cIndian\nchild\u201d within the meaning of the statute, see \u00a71903(4);\nante, at 2, n. 1, and Birth Father consequently qualifies\nas a \u201cparent\u201d under the Act. The statutory definition of\nparent \u201cdoes not include the unwed father where paternity\nhas not been acknowledged or established,\u201d \u00a71903(9), but\nBirth Father\u2019s biological paternity has never been ques\u00ad\ntioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test\nduring the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n109a (Sealed).\n   Petitioners and Baby Girl\u2019s guardian ad litem devote\nmany pages of briefing to arguing that the term \u201cparent\u201d\nshould be defined with reference to the law of the State in\nwhich an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place. See\nBrief for Petitioners 19\u201329; Brief for Respondent Guardian\nAd Litem 32\u201341. These arguments, however, are incon\u00ad\nsistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress\nintended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform\nfederal definitions. See 490 U. S., at 44\u201345. It is therefore\nunsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the\nmajority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that\nBirth Father is an ICWA \u201cparent.\u201d See ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Act\u2019s comprehensive definition of \u201cchild\ncustody proceeding\u201d includes not only \u201c \u2018adoptive place\u00ad\nment[s],\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018preadoptive placement[s],\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018foster care\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

This last category encompasses\n\u201cany action resulting in the termination of the parent-\nchild relationship,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added). So far,\nthen, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recog\u00ad\nnized status as Baby Girl\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d and that his \u201cparent\u00ad\nchild relationship\u201d with her is subject to the protections of\nthe Act.\n  These protections are numerous. Had Birth Father\npetitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for\nexample, the state court would have been obligated to\ntransfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good\ncause to the contrary. See \u00a71911(b). Any voluntary con\u00ad\nsent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption would have\nbeen invalid unless written and executed before a judge\nand would have been revocable up to the time a final\ndecree of adoption was entered.1 See \u00a7\u00a71913(a), (c). And\n\u00a71912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural\nand substantive standards applicable in \u201cinvoluntary\nproceeding[s] in a State court,\u201d including foster care\nplacements of Indian children and termination of paren\u00ad\ntal rights proceedings. \u00a71912(a). I consider \u00a71912\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsions in order.\n  Section 1912(a) requires that any party seeking \u201ctermi\u00ad\nnation of parental rights t[o] an Indian child\u201d provide\nnotice to both the child\u2019s \u201cparent or Indian custodian\u201d\nand the child\u2019s tribe \u201cof the pending proceedings and of\ntheir right of intervention.\u201d Section 1912(b) mandates\nthat counsel be provided for an indigent \u201cparent or In-\ndian custodian\u201d in any \u201ctermination proceeding.\u201d Section\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For this reason, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth\n\nFather did not give valid consent to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption when, four\nmonths after her birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted\nservice and was not contesting the adoption. See 398 S. C. 625, 645\u2013\n646, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at 5.

Although the Constitution does not compel the\nprotection of a biological father\u2019s parent-child relationship\nuntil he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has\nnevertheless recognized that \u201cthe biological connection . . .\noffers the natural father an opportunity that no other\nmale possesses to develop a relationship with his off\u00ad\nspring.\u201d Lehr v.

Having assumed a uniform federal\ndefinition of \u201cparent\u201d that confers certain procedural\nrights, the majority then illogically concludes that ICWA\u2019s\nsubstantive protections are available only to a subset of\n\u201cparent[s]\u201d: those who have previously had physical or\nstate-recognized legal custody of his or her child. The\nstatute does not support this departure.\n  Section 1912(d) provides that\n        \u201cAny party seeking to effect a foster care placement\n     of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\n     under State law shall satisfy the court that active\n     efforts have been made to provide remedial services\n     and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\n     breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts\n     have proved unsuccessful.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, subsection (d) requires that an attempt\nbe made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic\nmeasures of foster care placement or termination of paren\u00ad\ntal rights can be taken.\n  The majority would hold that the use of the phrase\n\u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d in this subsection means\nthat it does not apply where a birth father has not previ\u00ad\nously had custody of his child. Ante, at 12. But there is\nnothing about this capacious phrase that licenses such a\nnarrowing construction. As the majority notes, \u201cbreakup\u201d\nmeans \u201c \u2018[t]he discontinuance of a relationship.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n12 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed.\n1992)). So far, all of \u00a71912\u2019s provisions expressly apply in\nactions aimed at terminating the \u201cparent-child relation\u00ad\nship\u201d that exists between a birth father and his child, and\nthey extend to it meaningful protections. As a logical\nmatter, that relationship is fully capable of being pre\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nICWA, the notice and counsel provisions of 25 U. S.

Nothing in the text of subsection (d)\nindicates that this blood relationship should be excluded\nfrom the category of familial \u201crelationships\u201d that the pro-\nvision aims to save from \u201cdiscontinuance.\u201d\n   The majority, reaching the contrary conclusion, asserts\nbaldly that \u201cwhen an Indian parent abandons an Indian\nchild prior to birth and that child has never been in the\nIndian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody, there is no \u2018rela\u00ad\ntionship\u2019 that would be \u2018discontinu[ed]\u2019 . . . by the termina\u00ad\ntion of the Indian parent\u2019s rights.\u201d Ante, at 12. Says who?\nCertainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth\nFather as Baby Girl\u2019s \u201cparent,\u201d and, in conjunction with\nICWA\u2019s other provisions, it further establishes that their\n\u201cparent-child relationship\u201d is protected under federal law.\nIn the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no\nwarrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress\u2019 by\nsaying that \u201cno \u2018relationship\u2019 \u201d exists between Birth Father\nand Baby Girl simply because, based on the hotly con-\ntested facts of this case, it views their family bond as in-\nsufficiently substantial to deserve protection.3 Ibid.\n   The majority states that its \u201cinterpretation of \u00a71912(d)\nis . . . confirmed by the provision\u2019s placement next to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority\u2019s discussion of \u00a71912(d) repeatedly references Birth\n\nFather\u2019s purported \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d of Baby Girl, ante, at 12, 13, n. 8,\n14, and it contends that its holding with regard to this provision is\nlimited to such circumstances, see ante, at 13, n. 8; see also ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the\nmajority\u2019s holding given that it is contrary to the language and purpose\nof the statute, the majority never explains either the textual basis or\nthe precise scope of its \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation. I expect that the\nmajority\u2019s inexact use of the term \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d will sow confusion,\nbecause it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does\nnot have a uniform meaning from State to State.

This is the only aspect of\nthe majority\u2019s argument regarding \u00a71912(d) that is based\non ICWA\u2019s actual text rather than layers of assertion su-\nperimposed on the text; but the conclusion the majority\ndraws from the juxtaposition of these provisions is exactly\nbackward.\n  Section 1912(f ) is paired with \u00a71912(e), and as the ma\u00ad\njority notes, both come on the heels of the requirement of\nrehabilitative efforts just reviewed. The language of the\ntwo provisions is nearly identical; subsection (e) is headed\n\u201cFoster care placement orders,\u201d and subsection (f ), the\nrelevant provision here, is headed \u201cParental rights termi\u00ad\nnation orders.\u201d Subsection (f ) reads in its entirety,\n       \u201cNo termination of parental rights may be ordered\n     in such proceeding in the absence of a determination,\n     supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, in\u00ad\n     cluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that\n     the continued custody of the child by the parent or In\u00ad\n     dian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional\n     or physical damage to the child.\u201d \u00a71912(f ).4\nThe immediate inference to be drawn from the statute\u2019s\nstructure is that subsections (e) and (f ) work in tandem\nwith the rehabilitative efforts required by (d). Under\nsubsection (d), state authorities must attempt to provide\n\u201cremedial services and rehabilitative programs\u201d aimed at\navoiding foster care placement or termination of parental\nrights; (e) and (f ), in turn, bar state authorities from order\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The full text of subsection (e) is as follows:\n   \u201cNo foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in\nthe absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evi-\ndence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the\ncontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is\nlikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d\n\u00a71912(e).\n10               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ning foster care or terminating parental rights until these\ncurative efforts have failed and it is established that the\nchild will suffer \u201cserious emotional or physical damage\u201d if\nhis or her familial situation is not altered. Nothing in\nsubsections (a) through (d) suggests a limitation on the\ntypes of parental relationships that are protected by any of\nthe provisions of \u00a71912, and there is nothing in the struc\u00ad\nture of \u00a71912 that would lead a reader to expect subsection\n(e) or (f ) to introduce any such qualification. Indeed, both\nsubsections, in their opening lines, refer back to the prior\nprovisions of \u00a71912 with the phrase \u201cin such proceeding.\u201d\nThis language indicates, quite logically, that in actions\nwhere subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f )\napply too.5\n   All this, and still the most telling textual evidence is yet\nto come: The text of the subsection begins by announcing,\n\u201c[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered\u201d un\u00ad\nless the specified evidentiary showing is made. To repeat,\na \u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d includes \u201cany action\nresulting in the termination of the parent-child relation\u00ad\nship,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added), includ-\ning the relationship Birth Father, as an ICWA \u201cparent,\u201d\nhas with Baby Girl. The majority\u2019s reading disregards\nthe Act\u2019s sweeping definition of \u201ctermination of parental\nrights,\u201d which is not limited to terminations of custodial\nrelationships.\n  The entire foundation of the majority\u2019s argument that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 For these reasons, I reject the argument advanced by the United\n\nStates that subsection (d) applies in the circumstances of this case but\nsubsection (f ) does not. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24\u201326. The United States\u2019 position is contrary to the interrelated\nnature of \u00a7\u00a71912(d), (e), and (f ). Under the reading that the United\nStates proposes, in a case such as this one the curative provision would\nstand alone; ICWA would provide no evidentiary or substantive stand\u00ad\nards by which to measure whether foster care placement or termination\nof parental rights could be ordered in the event that rehabilitative\nefforts did not succeed. Such a scheme would be oddly incomplete.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

Emphasizing\nthat Birth Father never had physical custody or, under\nstate law, legal custody of Baby Girl, the majority finds\nthe statute inapplicable here. Ante, at 10\u201311. But \u201cliter\u00ad\nalness may strangle meaning.\u201d Utah Junk Co. v. Porter,\n328 U. S. 39, 44 (1946). See also Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,\n519 U. S. 337, 341\u2013345 (1997) (noting that a term that\nmay \u201c[a]t first blush\u201d seem unambiguous can prove other\u00ad\nwise when examined in the context of the statute as a\nwhole).6 In light of the structure of \u00a71912, which indicates\nthat subsection (f ) is applicable to the same actions to\nwhich subsections (a) through (d) are applicable; the use of\nthe phrase \u201csuch proceeding[s]\u201d at the start of subsection\n(f ) to reinforce this structural inference; and finally, the\nprovision\u2019s explicit statement that it applies to \u201ctermina\u00ad\ntion of parental rights\u201d proceedings, the necessary conclu\u00ad\nsion is that the word \u201ccustody\u201d does not strictly denote a\nstate-recognized custodial relationship. If one refers back\nto the Act\u2019s definitional section, this conclusion is not\nsurprising. Section 1903(1) includes \u201cany action resulting\nin the termination of the parent-child relationship\u201d within\nthe meaning of \u201cchild custody proceeding,\u201d thereby belying\nany congressional intent to give the term \u201ccustody\u201d a\nnarrow and exclusive definition throughout the statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The majority\u2019s interpretation is unpersuasive even if one focuses\n\nexclusively on the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d because, as JUSTICE\nSCALIA explains, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), nothing about the\nadjective \u201ccontinued\u201d mandates the retrospective, rather than prospec\u00ad\ntive, application of \u00a71912(f )\u2019s standard.\n12               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   In keeping with \u00a71903(1) and the structure and lan\u00ad\nguage of \u00a71912 overall, the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d is\nmost sensibly read to refer generally to the continuation of\nthe parent-child relationship that an ICWA \u201cparent\u201d has\nwith his or her child. A court applying \u00a71912(f ) where the\nparent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth\nFather argues, determine whether the party seeking ter\u00ad\nmination of parental rights has established that the con\u00ad\ntinuation of the parent-child relationship will result in\n\u201cserious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d7\n   The majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argu\u00ad\nment, that Birth Father is a \u201cparent\u201d within the meaning\nof ICWA. But the majority fails to account for all that\nfollows from that assumption. The majority repeatedly\npasses over the term \u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d that,\nas defined by \u00a71903, clearly encompasses an action aimed\nat severing Birth Father\u2019s \u201cparent-child relationship\u201d with\nBaby Girl. The majority chooses instead to focus on\nphrases not statutorily defined that it then uses to exclude\nBirth Father from the benefits of his parental status.\nWhen one must disregard a statute\u2019s use of terms that\nhave been explicitly defined by Congress, that should be a\nsignal that one is distorting, rather than faithfully read\u00ad\ning, the law in question.\n                              B\n     The majority also does not acknowledge the full impli\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The majority overlooks Birth Father\u2019s principal arguments when it\n\ndismisses his reading of \u00a71912(f ) as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Ante, at 8. He does\nargue that if one accepts petitioners\u2019 view that it is impossible to make\na determination of likely harm when a parent lacks custody, then the\nconsequence would be that \u201c \u2018[n]o termination of parental rights may be\nordered.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent Birth Father 39 (quoting \u00a71912(f )).\nBut Birth Father\u2019s primary arguments assume that it is indeed possible\nto make a determination of likely harm in the circumstances of this\ncase, and that parental rights can be terminated if \u00a71912(f ) is met.

Its dis\u00ad\ncussion focuses on Birth Father\u2019s particular actions, but\nnothing in the majority\u2019s reasoning limits its manufac\u00ad\ntured class of semiprotected ICWA parents to biological\nfathers who failed to support their child\u2019s mother during\npregnancy. Its logic would apply equally to noncustodial\nfathers who have actively participated in their child\u2019s\nupbringing.\n  Consider an Indian father who, though he has never had\ncustody of his biological child, visits her and pays all of his\nchild support obligations.8 Suppose that, due to deficien\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The   majority attempts to minimize the consequences of its holding\nby asserting that the parent-child relationships of noncustodial fathers\nwith visitation rights will be at stake in an ICWA proceeding in only\n\u201ca relatively small class of cases.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 8. But it offers no\nsupport for this assertion, beyond speculating that there will not be\nmany fathers affected by its interpretation of \u00a71912(d) because it is\nqualified by an \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation. Ibid. Tellingly, the major-\nity has nothing to say about \u00a71912(f ), despite the fact that its interpre\u00ad\ntation of that provision is not limited in a similar way. In any event,\nthis example by no means exhausts the class of semiprotected ICWA\nparents that the majority\u2019s opinion creates. It also includes, for exam\u00ad\nple, biological fathers who have not yet established a relationship with\ntheir child because the child\u2019s mother never informed them of the\npregnancy, see, e.g., In re Termination of Parental Rights of Biological\nParents of Baby Boy W., 1999 OK 74, 988 P. 2d 1270, told them falsely\nthat the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or termination, see, e.g., A\nChild\u2019s Hope, LLC v. Doe, 178 N. C. App. 96, 630 S. E. 2d 673 (2006), or\notherwise obstructed the father\u2019s involvement in the child\u2019s life, see,\ne.g., In re Baby Girl W., 728 S. W. 2d 545 (Mo. App. 1987) (birth mother\nmoved and did not inform father of her whereabouts); In re Petition of\nDoe, 159 Ill. 2d 347, 638 N. E. 2d 181 (1994) (father paid pregnancy\nexpenses until birth mother cut off contact with him and told him that\ntheir child had died shortly after birth). And it includes biological\nfathers who did not contribute to pregnancy expenses because they\nwere unable to do so, whether because the father lacked sufficient\nmeans, the expenses were covered by a third party, or the birth mother\ndid not pass on the relevant bills. See, e.g., In re Adoption of B. V.,\n2001 UT App 290, \u00b6\u00b6 24\u201331, 33 P. 3d 1083, 1087\u20131088.\n14                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Clearly,\nthe father\u2019s parental rights would have to be terminated\nbefore the adoption could go forward.9 On the majority\u2019s\nview, notwithstanding the fact that this father would be\na \u201cparent\u201d under ICWA, he would not receive the benefit\nof either \u00a71912(d) or \u00a71912(f ). Presumably the court con\u00ad\nsidering the adoption petition would have to apply some\nstandard to determine whether termination of his paren\u00ad\ntal rights was appropriate. But from whence would that\nstandard come?\n  Not from the statute Congress drafted, according to the\nmajority. The majority suggests that it might come from\nstate law. See ante, at 13, n. 8. But it is incongruous to\nsuppose that Congress intended a patchwork of federal\nand state law to apply in termination of parental rights\nproceedings. Congress enacted a statute aimed at protect\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   The majority expresses the concern that my reading of the statute\nwould produce \u201cfar-reaching consequences,\u201d because \u201ceven a sperm\ndonor\u201d would be entitled to ICWA\u2019s protections. Ante, at 13\u201314, n. 8.

As between a possibly overinclusive in\u00ad\nterpretation of the statute that covers this unlikely class of cases, and\nthe majority\u2019s underinclusive interpretation that has the very real\nconsequence of denying ICWA\u2019s protections to all noncustodial biologi\u00ad\ncal fathers, it is surely the majority\u2019s reading that is contrary to ICWA\u2019s\ndesign.\n   9 With a few exceptions not relevant here, before a final decree of\n\nadoption may be entered, one of two things must happen: \u201cthe biological\nparents must either voluntarily relinquish their parental rights or have\ntheir rights involuntarily terminated.\u201d 2A.

See, e.g.,\nIn re Adoption of Tobias D., 2012 Me. 45, \u00b627, 40 A. 3d\n990, 999 (recognizing that award of custody of 2\u00bd-year-old\nchild to biological father under applicable state law once\npaternity is established will result in the \u201cdifficult and pain-\nful\u201d necessity of \u201cremoving the child from the only home\nhe has ever known\u201d). On the other hand, these rules\nrecognize that biological fathers have a valid interest in a\nrelationship with their child. See supra, at 6. And chil\u00ad\ndren have a reciprocal interest in knowing their biological\nparents. See Santosky, 455 U.

These rules also reflect the understanding\nthat the biological bond between a parent and a child is a\nstrong foundation on which a stable and caring relation\u00ad\nship may be built. Many jurisdictions apply a custodial\npreference for a fit natural parent over a party lacking\nthis biological link. See, e.g., Ex parte Terry, 494 So. 2d\n628, 632 (Ala. 1986); Appeal of H.

This pref\u00ad\nerence is founded in the \u201cpresumption that fit parents act\nin the best interests of their children.\u201d Troxel v. Granville,\n530 U.

(quoting Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602 (1979)).\n   Balancing the legitimate interests of unwed biological\nfathers against the need for stability in a child\u2019s family\nsituation is difficult, to be sure, and States have, over the\nyears, taken different approaches to the problem. Some\nStates, like South Carolina, have opted to hew to the con\u00ad\nstitutional baseline established by this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents and do not require a biological father\u2019s consent to\nadoption unless he has provided financial support during\npregnancy. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 254\u2013\n256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U. S., at 261. Other States, how-\never, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers\nmore robust protection and to afford them consent rights\non the basis of their biological link to the child. At the\ntime that ICWA was passed, as noted, over one-fourth of\nStates did so. See supra, at 17\u201318.\n   ICWA, on a straightforward reading of the statute, is\nconsistent with the law of those States that protected, and\nprotect, birth fathers\u2019 rights more vigorously. This read\u00ad\ning can hardly be said to generate an anomaly. ICWA, as\nall acknowledge, was \u201cthe product of rising concern . . .\n[about] abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the\nseparation of large numbers of Indian children from their\nfamilies.\u201d Holyfield, 490 U.

Ante, at 14, 16. This claim is the most perplex\u00ad\ning of all. A central purpose of ICWA is to \u201cpromote the\nstability and security of Indian . . . families,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a71902, in part by countering the trend of placing \u201can\nalarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children . . . in non-\nIndian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d\n\u00a71901(4). The Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protect\u00ad\ning the familial bonds of Indian parents and children, see\nsupra, at 4\u201312; and, second, establishing placement pref\u00ad\nerences should an adoption take place, see \u00a71915(a).\nICWA does not interfere with the adoption of Indian chil\u00ad\ndren except to the extent that it attempts to avert the\nnecessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of\nIndian children by non-Indian families less likely.\n  The majority may consider this scheme unwise. But\nno principle of construction licenses a court to interpret a\nstatute with a view to averting the very consequences\nCongress expressly stated it was trying to bring about.\nInstead, it is the \u201c \u2018judicial duty to give faithful meaning to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 It bears emphasizing that the ICWA standard for termination of\n\nparental rights of which Birth Father claims the benefit is more protec\u00ad\ntive than, but not out of step with, the clear and convincing standard\ngenerally applied in state courts when termination of parental rights\nis sought. Birth Father does not claim that he is entitled to custody\nof Baby Girl unless petitioners can satisfy the demanding standard of\n\u00a71912(f ). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 40, n. 15. The ques\u00ad\ntion of custody would be analyzed independently, as it was by the South\nCarolina Supreme Court. Of course, it will often be the case that cus\u00ad\ntody is subsequently granted to a child\u2019s fit parent, consistent with\nthe presumption that a natural parent will act in the best interests of\nhis child.

Ante, at 9\u201310. We may not, however, give\neffect only to congressional goals we designate \u201cprimary\u201d\nwhile casting aside others classed as \u201csecondary\u201d; we must\napply the entire statute Congress has written. While there\nare indications that central among Congress\u2019 concerns\nin enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian children\nfrom homes in which Indian parents or other guardians\nhad custody of them, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71901(4), 1902, Con-\ngress also recognized that \u201cthere is no resource that is\nmore vital to the continued existence and integrity of\nIndian tribes than their children,\u201d \u00a71901(3). As we ob\u00ad\nserved in Holyfield, ICWA protects not only Indian par\u00ad\nents\u2019 interests but also those of Indian tribes. See 490\nU. S., at 34, 52. A tribe\u2019s interest in its next generation of\ncitizens is adversely affected by the placement of Indian\nchildren in homes with no connection to the tribe, whether\nor not those children were initially in the custody of an\nIndian parent.15\n   Moreover, the majority\u2019s focus on \u201cintact\u201d families, ante,\nat 10, begs the question of what Congress set out to ac\u00ad\ncomplish with ICWA. In an ideal world, perhaps all\nparents would be perfect.

They\nwould never suffer mental health problems, lose their jobs,\nstruggle with substance dependency, or encounter any of\nthe other multitudinous personal crises that can make it\ndifficult to meet these responsibilities. In an ideal world\nparents would never become estranged and leave their\nchildren caught in the middle. But we do not live in\nsuch a world. Even happy families do not always fit the\ncustodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve\nIWCA\u2019s substantive protections; unhappy families all too\noften do not. They are families nonetheless. Congress\nunderstood as much. ICWA\u2019s definitions of \u201cparent\u201d and\n\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d provided in \u00a71903 sweep\nbroadly. They should be honored.\n                              D\n  The majority does not rely on the theory pressed by\npetitioners and the guardian ad litem that the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance compels the conclusion that ICWA\nis inapplicable here. See Brief for Petitioners 43\u201351;\nBrief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 48\u201358. It\nstates instead that it finds the statute clear.16 Ante, at 17.\nBut the majority nevertheless offers the suggestion that a\ncontrary result would create an equal protection problem.\nIbid. Cf.

See United States v. Antelope, 430\nU. S. 641, 645\u2013647 (1977); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S.\n535, 553\u2013554 (1974). The majority\u2019s repeated, analytically\nunnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256\nCherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intima\u00ad\ntion that the statute may violate the Equal Protection\nClause as applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante,\nat 16 (stating that ICWA \u201cwould put certain vulner-\nable children at a great disadvantage solely because an\nancestor\u2014even a remote one\u2014was an Indian\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the\nmembership requirements of federally recognized Indian\ntribes, which are independent political entities. See Santa\nClara Pueblo v.

S. 49, 72, n. 32 (1978).\nI am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal\nGovernment requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for\nofficial recognition, to make \u201cdescen[t] from a historical\nIndian tribe\u201d a condition of membership. 25 CFR \u00a783.7(e)\n(2012).\n   The majority\u2019s treatment of this issue, in the end, does\nno more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of\nthe criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee\nNation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an \u201cIndian child\u201d\nunder the statute. Its hints at lurking constitutional\nproblems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory\nanalysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.\n                           III\n  Because I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt on the ground that \u00a71912 bars the termination of\nBirth Father\u2019s parental rights, I would not reach the\nquestion of the applicability of the adoptive placement\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           25\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npreferences of \u00a71915. I note, however, that the majority\ndoes not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on re\u00ad\nmand, Baby Girl\u2019s paternal grandparents or other mem\u00ad\nbers of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for\nadoption of Baby Girl. If these parties do so, and if on\nremand Birth Father\u2019s parental rights are terminated so\nthat an adoption becomes possible, they will then be enti\u00ad\ntled to consideration under the order of preference estab\u00ad\nlished in \u00a71915. The majority cannot rule prospectively\nthat \u00a71915 would not apply to an adoption petition that\nhas not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies \u201c[i]n\nany adoptive placement of an Indian child under State\nlaw,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71915(a) (emphasis added), and contains\nno temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd\nresult for this Court, in the name of the child\u2019s best in-\nterests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro\u00ad\nceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her\npaternal grandparents, who may have well-established\nrelationships with her.\n                         *    *    *\n   The majority opinion turns \u00a71912 upside down, reading\nit from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is\nmanifestly contrary to Congress\u2019 express purpose in enact\u00ad\ning ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian\nparents and their children and, more broadly, Indian\ntribes\u2019 relationships with the future citizens who are \u201cvital\nto [their] continued existence and integrity.\u201d \u00a71901(3).\n   The majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the\npainful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he\nintervened \u201cat the eleventh hour to override the mother\u2019s\ndecision and the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d ante, at 16. I have\nno wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month\u00ad\nold child from her adoptive family. It bears remembering,\nhowever, that Birth Father took action to assert his paren\u00ad\ntal rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as soon as\n26            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhe learned of the impending adoption. As the South Caro\u00ad\nlina Supreme Court recognized, \u201c \u2018[h]ad the mandate of . . .\nICWA been followed [in 2010], . . . much potential anguish\nmight have been avoided[;] and in any case the law cannot\nbe applied so as automatically to \u201creward those who obtain\ncustody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it\nduring any ensuing (and protracted) litigation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 398\nS. C., at 652, 731 S. E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490\nU. S., at 53\u201354).\n   The majority\u2019s hollow literalism distorts the statute and\nignores Congress\u2019 purpose in order to rectify a perceived\nwrong that, while heartbreaking at the time, was a correct\napplication of federal law and that in any case cannot be\nundone. Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18\nmonths. However difficult it must have been for her to\nleave Adoptive Couple\u2019s home when she was just over 2\nyears old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age\nof 3\u00bd, she is again removed from her home and sent to live\nhalfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreor\u00ad\ndained, of course. But it can be said with certainty that\nthe anguish this case has caused will only be compounded\nby today\u2019s decision.\n   I believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment was correct, and I would affirm it. I respectfully\ndissent.\n",

Argued April 16, 2013\u2014Decided June 25, 2013\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which establishes feder-\n  al standards for state-court child custody proceedings involving Indi-\n  an children, was enacted to address \u201cthe consequences . . . of abusive\n  child welfare practices that [separated] Indian children from their\n  families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usual-\n  ly in non-Indian homes,\u201d Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\n  Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32. As relevant here, the ICWA bars involun-\n  tary termination of a parent\u2019s rights in the absence of a heightened\n  showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from\n  the parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of the child, 25 U. S. C. \u00a71912(f);\n  conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to\n  an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to\n  prevent the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family,\u201d \u00a71912(d); and provides\n  placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children to members\n  of the child\u2019s extended family, other members of the Indian child\u2019s\n  tribe, and other Indian families, \u00a71915(a).\n     While Birth Mother was pregnant with Biological Father\u2019s child,\n  their relationship ended and Biological Father (a member of the\n  Cherokee Nation) agreed to relinquish his parental rights. Birth\n  Mother put Baby Girl up for adoption through a private adoption\n  agency and selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in South\n  Carolina. For the duration of the pregnancy and the first four\n  months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Biological Father provided no finan-\n  cial assistance to Birth Mother or Baby Girl. About four months after\n  Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Adoptive Couple served Biological Father with no-\n  tice of the pending adoption. In the adoption proceedings, Biological\n  Father sought custody and stated that he did not consent to the adop-\n  tion. Following a trial, which took place when Baby Girl was two\n2                  ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    years old, the South Carolina Family Court denied Adoptive Couple\u2019s\n    adoption petition and awarded custody to Biological Father. At the\n    age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Biological Father,\n    whom she had never met. The State Supreme Court affirmed, con-\n    cluding that the ICWA applied because the child custody proceeding\n    related to an Indian child; that Biological Father was a \u201cparent\u201d un-\n    der the ICWA; that \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f) barred the termination of his\n    parental rights; and that had his rights been terminated, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s\n    adoption-placement preferences would have applied.\nHeld:\n    1. Assuming for the sake of argument that Biological Father is a\n \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA, neither \u00a71912(f) nor \u00a71912(d) bars the\n termination of his parental rights. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (a) Section 1912(f) conditions the involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights on a heightened showing regarding the merits of the\n parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody of the child.\u201d The adjective \u201ccontinued\u201d\n plainly refers to a pre-existing state under ordinary dictionary defini-\n tions. The phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d thus refers to custody that a\n parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past). As a\n result, \u00a71912(f) does not apply where the Indian parent never had\n custody of the Indian child. This reading comports with the statutory\n text, which demonstrates that the ICWA was designed primarily to\n counteract the unwarranted removal of Indian children from Indian\n families. See \u00a71901(4). But the ICWA\u2019s primary goal is not implicat-\n ed when an Indian child\u2019s adoption is voluntarily and lawfully initi-\n ated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights. Nonbinding\n guidelines issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) demonstrate\n that the BIA envisioned that \u00a71912(f)\u2019s standard would apply only to\n termination of a custodial parent\u2019s rights. Under this reading, Bio-\n logical Father should not have been able to invoke \u00a71912(f) in this\n case because he had never had legal or physical custody of Baby Girl\n as of the time of the adoption proceedings. Pp. 7\u201311.\n       (b) Section \u00a71912(d) conditions an involuntary termination of pa-\n rental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing \u201cthat active\n efforts have been made to provide remedial services . . . designed to\n prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have\n proved unsuccessful.\u201d Consistent with this text, \u00a71912(d) applies on-\n ly when an Indian family\u2019s \u201cbreakup\u201d would be precipitated by termi-\n nating parental rights. The term \u201cbreakup\u201d refers in this context to\n \u201c[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,\u201d American Heritage Diction-\n ary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or \u201can ending as an effective entity,\u201d Webster\u2019s\n Third New International Dictionary 273 (1961). But when an Indian\n parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has\n never been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody, there is\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

In such a situa-\n  tion, the \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d has long since occurred, and\n  \u00a71912(d) is inapplicable. This interpretation is consistent with the\n  explicit congressional purpose of setting certain \u201cstandards for the\n  removal of Indian children from their families,\u201d \u00a71902, and with BIA\n  Guidelines. Section 1912(d)\u2019s proximity to \u00a7\u00a71912(e) and (f), which\n  both condition the outcome of proceedings on the merits of an Indian\n  child\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d with his parent, strongly suggests that\n  the phrase \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d should be read in harmony\n  with the \u201ccontinued custody\u201d requirement. Pp. 11\u201314.\n     2. Section 1915(a)\u2019s adoption-placement preferences are inapplica-\n  ble in cases where no alternative party has formally sought to adopt\n  the child. No party other than Adoptive Couple sought to adopt Baby\n  Girl in the Family Court or the South Carolina Supreme Court. Bio-\n  logical Father is not covered by \u00a71915(a) because he did not seek to\n  adopt Baby Girl; instead, he argued that his parental rights should\n  not be terminated in the first place. And custody was never sought\n  by Baby Girl\u2019s paternal grandparents, other members of the Chero-\n  kee Nation, or other Indian families. Pp. 14\u201316.\n398 S. C. 625, 731 S.

The\nprovisions of the federal statute at issue here do not de-\nmand this result.\n   Contrary to the State Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we hold\nthat 25 U. S. C. \u00a71912(f )\u2014which bars involuntary termi-\nnation of a parent\u2019s rights in the absence of a heightened\nshowing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to\nresult from the parent\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of the child\u2014\ndoes not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never\nhad custody of the child. We further hold that \u00a71912(d)\u2014\nwhich conditions involuntary termination of parental\n2                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nrights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that\nremedial efforts have been made to prevent the \u201cbreakup\nof the Indian family\u201d\u2014is inapplicable when, as here, the\nparent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never\nhad custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that \u00a71915(a),\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adoption of\nIndian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like\nAdoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no\nother eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child.\nWe accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment and remand for further proceedings.\n                             I\n   \u201cThe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 92 Stat.\n3069, 25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71901\u20131963, was the product of rising\nconcern in the mid-1970\u2019s over the consequences to In-\ndian children, Indian families, and Indian tribes of abusive\nchild welfare practices that resulted in the separation of\nlarge numbers of Indian children from their families and\ntribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually\nin non-Indian homes.\u201d Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indi-\nans v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 32 (1989). Congress found\nthat \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian families\n[were being] broken up by the removal, often unwarranted,\nof their children from them by nontribal public and\nprivate agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4). This \u201cwholesale removal of\nIndian children from their homes\u201d prompted Congress to\nenact the ICWA, which establishes federal standards that\ngovern state-court child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children. Id., at 32, 36 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also \u00a71902 (declaring that the ICWA es-\ntablishes \u201cminimum Federal standards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families\u201d).1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an \u201cIndian child\u201d as defined by the\n\nICWA because she is an unmarried minor who \u201cis eligible for member-\nship in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n  Three provisions of the ICWA are especially relevant to\nthis case. First, \u201c[a]ny party seeking\u201d an involuntary\ntermination of parental rights to an Indian child under\nstate law must demonstrate that \u201cactive efforts have\nbeen made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative\nprograms designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d\n\u00a71912(d). Second, a state court may not involuntarily\nterminate parental rights to an Indian child \u201cin the ab-\nsence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert\nwitnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the\nparent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d \u00a71912(f ).\nThird, with respect to adoptive placements for an Indian\nchild under state law, \u201ca preference shall be given, in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with\n(1) a member of the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other\nmembers of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian\nfamilies.\u201d \u00a71915(a).\n                            II\n  In this case, Birth Mother (who is predominantly His-\npanic) and Biological Father (who is a member of the\nCherokee Nation) became engaged in December 2008.\nOne month later, Birth Mother informed Biological Fa-\nther, who lived about four hours away, that she was preg-\nnant. After learning of the pregnancy, Biological Father\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nIndian tribe,\u201d \u00a71903(4)(b).

BABY GIRL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nasked Birth Mother to move up the date of the wedding.\nHe also refused to provide any financial support until after\nthe two had married. The couple\u2019s relationship deteriorated,\nand Birth Mother broke off the engagement in May 2009.\nIn June, Birth Mother sent Biological Father a text mes-\nsage asking if he would rather pay child support or re-\nlinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded\nvia text message that he relinquished his rights.\n   Birth Mother then decided to put Baby Girl up for adop-\ntion. Because Birth Mother believed that Biological Fa-\nther had Cherokee Indian heritage, her attorney contacted\nthe Cherokee Nation to determine whether Biological\nFather was formally enrolled. The inquiry letter mis-\nspelled Biological Father\u2019s first name and incorrectly\nstated his birthday, and the Cherokee Nation responded\nthat, based on the information provided, it could not verify\nBiological Father\u2019s membership in the tribal records.\n   Working through a private adoption agency, Birth\nMother selected Adoptive Couple, non-Indians living in\nSouth Carolina, to adopt Baby Girl. Adoptive Couple\nsupported Birth Mother both emotionally and financially\nthroughout her pregnancy. Adoptive Couple was present\nat Baby Girl\u2019s birth in Oklahoma on September 15, 2009,\nand Adoptive Father even cut the umbilical cord. The\nnext morning, Birth Mother signed forms relinquishing\nher parental rights and consenting to the adoption. Adop-\ntive Couple initiated adoption proceedings in South Caro-\nlina a few days later, and returned there with Baby Girl.\nAfter returning to South Carolina, Adoptive Couple al-\nlowed Birth Mother to visit and communicate with Baby\nGirl.\n   It is undisputed that, for the duration of the pregnancy\nand the first four months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth, Biologi-\ncal Father provided no financial assistance to Birth Mother\nor Baby Girl, even though he had the ability to do so. In-\ndeed, Biological Father \u201cmade no meaningful attempts\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nto assume his responsibility of parenthood\u201d during this\nperiod. App. to Pet. for Cert. 122a (Sealed; internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n   Approximately four months after Baby Girl\u2019s birth,\nAdoptive Couple served Biological Father with notice of\nthe pending adoption. (This was the first notification\nthat they had provided to Biological Father regarding\nthe adoption proceeding.) Biological Father signed papers\nstating that he accepted service and that he was \u201cnot\ncontesting the adoption.\u201d App. 37. But Biological Father\nlater testified that, at the time he signed the papers, he\nthought that he was relinquishing his rights to Birth\nMother, not to Adoptive Couple.\n   Biological Father contacted a lawyer the day after sign-\ning the papers, and subsequently requested a stay of the\nadoption proceedings.2 In the adoption proceedings, Bio-\nlogical Father sought custody and stated that he did not\nconsent to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption. Moreover, Biological\nFather took a paternity test, which verified that he was\nBaby Girl\u2019s biological father.\n   A trial took place in the South Carolina Family Court in\nSeptember 2011, by which time Baby Girl was two years\nold. 398 S. C. 625, 634\u2013635, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 555\u2013556\n(2012). The Family Court concluded that Adoptive Couple\nhad not carried the heightened burden under \u00a71912(f ) of\nproving that Baby Girl would suffer serious emotional or\nphysical damage if Biological Father had custody.

On December 31, 2011, at\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Around  the same time, the Cherokee Nation identified Biological\nFather as a registered member and concluded that Baby Girl was an\n\u201cIndian child\u201d as defined in the ICWA. The Cherokee Nation inter-\nvened in the litigation approximately three months later.\n6               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nthe age of 27 months, Baby Girl was handed over to Bio-\nlogical Father, whom she had never met.3\n   The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Family\nCourt\u2019s denial of the adoption and the award of custody to\nBiological Father. Id., at 629, 731 S. E. 2d, at 552. The\nState Supreme Court first determined that the ICWA\napplied because the case involved a child custody proceed-\ning relating to an Indian child. Id., at 637, 643, n. 18, 731\nS. E. 2d, at 556, 560, n. 18.

The court then held that\ntwo separate provisions of the ICWA barred the termina-\ntion of Biological Father\u2019s parental rights. First, the court\nheld that Adoptive Couple had not shown that \u201cactive\nefforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and\nrehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup\nof the Indian family.\u201d \u00a71912(d); see also id., at 647\u2013648,\n731 S. E. 2d, at 562.

E. 2d, at 562\u2013563 (citing \u00a71912(f )). Finally,\nthe court stated that, even if it had decided to terminate\nBiological Father\u2019s parental rights, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s adoption-\nplacement preferences would have applied.

E. 2d, at\n560, n. 19 (\u201cUnder state law, [Biological] Father\u2019s con-\nsent to the adoption would not have been required\u201d). The\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court held, however, that Biolog-\nical Father is a \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA and that two\nstatutory provisions\u2014namely, \u00a71912(f ) and \u00a71912(d)\u2014bar\nthe termination of his parental rights. In this Court,\nAdoptive Couple contends that Biological Father is not a\n\u201cparent\u201d and that \u00a71912(f ) and \u00a71912(d) are inapplicable.\nWe need not\u2014and therefore do not\u2014decide whether Bio-\nlogical Father is a \u201cparent.\u201d See \u00a71903(9) (defining \u201cpar-\nent\u201d).4 Rather, assuming for the sake of argument that he\nis a \u201cparent,\u201d we hold that neither \u00a71912(f ) nor \u00a71912(d)\nbars the termination of his parental rights.\n                              A\n   Section 1912(f ) addresses the involuntary termination\nof parental rights with respect to an Indian child. Specifi-\ncally, \u00a71912(f ) provides that \u201c[n]o termination of parental\nrights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of\na determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasona-\nble doubt, . . . that the continued custody of the child by\nthe parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious\nemotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) The South Carolina Supreme Court held that\nAdoptive Couple failed to satisfy \u00a71912(f ) because they did\nnot make a heightened showing that Biological Father\u2019s\n\u201cprospective legal and physical custody\u201d would likely result\nin serious damage to the child. 398 S. C., at 651, 731 S. E.\n2d, at 564 (emphasis added). That holding was error.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   4 If Biological Father is not a \u201cparent\u201d under the ICWA, then \u00a71912(f )\n\nand \u00a71912(d)\u2014which relate to proceedings involving possible termina-\ntion of \u201cparental\u201d rights\u2014are inapplicable. Because we conclude that\nthese provisions are inapplicable for other reasons, however, we need\nnot decide whether Biological Father is a \u201cparent.\u201d\n8                ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  Section 1912(f ) conditions the involuntary termination\nof parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of\n\u201ccontinued custody of the child by the parent.\u201d (Emphasis\nadded.) The adjective \u201ccontinued\u201d plainly refers to a pre-\nexisting state. As JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR concedes, post, at\n11 (dissenting opinion) (hereinafter the dissent), \u201ccontin-\nued\u201d means \u201c[c]arried on or kept up without cessation\u201d\nor \u201c[e]xtended in space without interruption or breach of\nconne[ct]ion.\u201d Compact Edition of the Oxford English\nDictionary 909 (1981 reprint of 1971 ed.)

The term \u201ccontinued\u201d\nalso can mean \u201cresumed after interruption.\u201d Webster\u2019s\n493; see American Heritage Dictionary 288. The phrase\n\u201ccontinued custody\u201d therefore refers to custody that a\nparent already has (or at least had at some point in the\npast). As a result, \u00a71912(f ) does not apply in cases where\nthe Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child.5\n  Biological Father\u2019s contrary reading of \u00a71912(f ) is non-\nsensical.

A biological father\u2019s \u201ccontinued custody\u201d of a child cannot be\nassessed if the father never had custody at all, and the use of a differ-\nent phrase\u2014\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d\u2014cannot change that. In\naddition, the dissent\u2019s reliance on subsection headings, post, at 9,\noverlooks the fact that those headings were not actually enacted by\nCongress.

See Brief for\nRespondent Birth Father 39. But it would be absurd to\nthink that Congress enacted a provision that permits\ntermination of a custodial parent\u2019s rights, while simulta-\nneously prohibiting termination of a noncustodial parent\u2019s\nrights. If the statute draws any distinction between\ncustodial and noncustodial parents, that distinction\nsurely does not provide greater protection for noncustodial\nparents.6\n   Our reading of \u00a71912(f ) comports with the statutory text\ndemonstrating that the primary mischief the ICWA was\ndesigned to counteract was the unwarranted removal of\nIndian children from Indian families due to the cultural\ninsensitivity and biases of social workers and state courts.\nThe statutory text expressly highlights the primary prob-\nlem that the statute was intended to solve: \u201can alarmingly\nhigh percentage of Indian families [were being] broken up\nby the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from\nthem by nontribal public and private agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4)\n(emphasis added); see also \u00a71902 (explaining that the\nICWA establishes \u201cminimum Federal standards for the\nremoval of Indian children from their families\u201d (emphasis\nadded)); Holyfield, 490 U.

See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 95\u20131386,\np. 8 (1978) (explaining that, as relevant here, \u201c[t]he pur-\npose of [the ICWA] is to protect the best interests of Indian\nchildren and to promote the stability and security of Indian\ntribes and families by establishing minimum Federal\nstandards for the removal of Indian children from their\nfamilies and the placement of such children in foster or\nadoptive homes\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 9 (decrying the\n\u201cwholesale separation of Indian children\u201d from their Indian\nfamilies); id., at 22 (discussing \u201cthe removal\u201d of Indian\nchildren from their parents pursuant to \u00a7\u00a71912(e) and (f )).\nIn sum, when, as here, the adoption of an Indian child is\nvoluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent\nwith sole custodial rights, the ICWA\u2019s primary goal of\npreventing the unwarranted removal of Indian children\nand the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated.\n   The dissent fails to dispute that nonbinding guidelines\nissued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) shortly after\nthe ICWA\u2019s enactment demonstrate that the BIA envi-\nsioned that \u00a71912(f )\u2019s standard would apply only to termi-\nnation of a custodial parent\u2019s rights.

As an initial\nmatter, it is undisputed that Biological Father never had\nphysical custody of Baby Girl. And as a matter of both\nSouth Carolina and Oklahoma law, Biological Father\nnever had legal custody either. See S. C.

See post, at 17\u201318, and n. 12 (emphasis\nadded). This is entirely beside the point, because we merely conclude\nthat, based on the statute\u2019s text and structure, Congress did not extend\nthe heightened protections of \u00a71912(d) and \u00a71912(f ) to all biological\nfathers. The fact that state laws may provide certain protections to\nbiological fathers who have abandoned their children and who have\nnever had custody of their children in no way undermines our analysis\nof these two federal statutory provisions.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d\n(Emphasis added.) The South Carolina Supreme Court\nfound that Biological Father\u2019s parental rights could not\nbe terminated because Adoptive Couple had not demon-\nstrated that Biological Father had been provided remedial\nservices in accordance with \u00a71912(d). 398 S. C., at 647\u2013\n648, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. We disagree.\n   Consistent with the statutory text, we hold that\n\u00a71912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family\u2019s\n\u201cbreakup\u201d would be precipitated by the termination of the\nparent\u2019s rights. The term \u201cbreakup\u201d refers in this context\nto \u201c[t]he discontinuance of a relationship,\u201d American Her-\nitage Dictionary 235 (3d ed. 1992), or \u201can ending as an\neffective entity,\u201d Webster\u2019s 273 (defining \u201cbreakup\u201d as \u201ca\ndisruption or dissolution into component parts: an ending\nas an effective entity\u201d). See also Compact OED 1076\n(defining \u201cbreak-up\u201d as, inter alia, a \u201cdisruption, separa-\ntion into parts, disintegration\u201d). But when an Indian\nparent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that\nchild has never been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or\nphysical custody, there is no \u201crelationship\u201d that would be\n\u201cdiscontinu[ed]\u201d\u2014and no \u201ceffective entity\u201d that would\nbe \u201cend[ed]\u201d\u2014by the termination of the Indian par-\nent\u2019s rights. In such a situation, the \u201cbreakup of the\nIndian family\u201d has long since occurred, and \u00a71912(d) is\ninapplicable.\n   Our interpretation of \u00a71912(d) is, like our interpretation\nof \u00a71912(f ), consistent with the explicit congressional\npurpose of providing certain \u201cstandards for the removal of\nIndian children from their families.\u201d \u00a71902 (emphasis\nadded); see also, e.g., \u00a71901(4); Holyfield, 490 U. S., at 32\u2013\n34. In addition, the BIA\u2019s Guidelines confirm that reme-\ndial services under \u00a71912(d) are intended \u201cto alleviate the\nneed to remove the Indian child from his or her parents or\nIndian custodians,\u201d not to facilitate a transfer of the child\nto an Indian parent.

That these three provisions appear adjacent to\neach other strongly suggests that the phrase \u201cbreakup of\nthe Indian family\u201d should be read in harmony with the\n\u201ccontinued custody\u201d requirement. See United Sav. Assn.\nof Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484\nU. S. 365, 371 (1988) (explaining that statutory construc-\ntion \u201cis a holistic endeavor\u201d and that \u201c[a] provision that\nmay seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the\nremainder of the statutory scheme\u201d). None of these three\nprovisions creates parental rights for unwed fathers where\nno such rights would otherwise exist. Instead, Indian\nparents who are already part of an \u201cIndian family\u201d are\nprovided with access to \u201cremedial services and rehabilita-\ntive programs\u201d under \u00a71912(d) so that their \u201ccustody\u201d\nmight be \u201ccontinued\u201d in a way that avoids foster-care\nplacement under \u00a71912(e) or termination of parental\nrights under \u00a71912(f ). In other words, the provision of\n\u201cremedial services and rehabilitative programs\u201d under\n\u00a71912(d) supports the \u201ccontinued custody\u201d that is protected\nby \u00a71912(e) and \u00a71912(f ).8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The dissent claims that our reasoning \u201cnecessarily extends to all\n\nIndian parents who have never had custody of their children,\u201d even if\nthose parents have visitation rights. Post, at 2\u20133, 13\u201314. As an initial\nmatter, the dissent\u2019s concern about the effect of our decision on individ-\nuals with visitation rights will be implicated, at most, in a relatively\nsmall class of cases. For example, our interpretation of \u00a71912(d) would\nimplicate the dissent\u2019s concern only in the case of a parent who aban-\ndoned his or her child prior to birth and never had physical or legal\ncustody, but did have some sort of visitation rights. Moreover, in cases\nwhere this concern is implicated, such parents might receive \u201ccompara-\nble\u201d protections under state law. See post, at 15. And in any event, it is\nthe dissent\u2019s interpretation that would have far-reaching consequences:\n14               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Section 1912(d) is a sensible requirement when applied\nto state social workers who might otherwise be too quick\nto remove Indian children from their Indian families. It\nwould, however, be unusual to apply \u00a71912(d) in the con-\ntext of an Indian parent who abandoned a child prior to\nbirth and who never had custody of the child. The decision\nbelow illustrates this point. The South Carolina Supreme\nCourt held that \u00a71912(d) mandated measures such as\n\u201cattempting to stimulate [Biological] Father\u2019s desire to be\na parent.\u201d 398 S. C., at 647, 731 S. E. 2d, at 562. But if\nprospective adoptive parents were required to engage in\nthe bizarre undertaking of \u201cstimulat[ing]\u201d a biological\nfather\u2019s \u201cdesire to be a parent,\u201d it would surely dissuade\nsome of them from seeking to adopt Indian children.9 And\nthis would, in turn, unnecessarily place vulnerable Indian\nchildren at a unique disadvantage in finding a permanent\nand loving home, even in cases where neither an Indian\nparent nor the relevant tribe objects to the adoption.10\n   In sum, the South Carolina Supreme Court erred in\nfinding that \u00a71912(d) barred termination of Biological\nFather\u2019s parental rights.\n                             IV\n     In the decision below, the South Carolina Supreme\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nUnder the dissent\u2019s reading, any biological parent\u2014even a sperm\ndonor\u2014would enjoy the heightened protections of \u00a71912(d) and\n\u00a71912(f ), even if he abandoned the mother and the child immediately\nafter conception.

C., at 655\u2013657, 731 S. E. 2d, at 566\u2013567. In so\ndoing, however, the court failed to recognize a critical lim-\nitation on the scope of \u00a71915(a).\n   Section 1915(a) provides that \u201c[i]n any adoptive place-\nment of an Indian child under State law, a preference\nshall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary,\nto a placement with (1) a member of the child\u2019s extended\nfamily; (2) other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe; or\n(3) other Indian families.\u201d Contrary to the South Carolina\nSupreme Court\u2019s suggestion, \u00a71915(a)\u2019s preferences are\ninapplicable in cases where no alternative party has for-\nmally sought to adopt the child. This is because there\nsimply is no \u201cpreference\u201d to apply if no alternative party\nthat is eligible to be preferred under \u00a71915(a) has come\nforward.\n   In this case, Adoptive Couple was the only party that\nsought to adopt Baby Girl in the Family Court or the\nSouth Carolina Supreme Court. See Brief for Petitioners\n19, 55; Brief for Respondent Birth Father 48; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 13. Biological Father is not covered by\n\u00a71915(a) because he did not seek to adopt Baby Girl; in-\nstead, he argued that his parental rights should not be\nterminated in the first place.11 Moreover, Baby Girl\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 Section 1915(c) also provides that, in the case of an adoptive place-\nment under \u00a71915(a), \u201cif the Indian child\u2019s tribe shall establish a\ndifferent order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting\nthe placement shall follow such order so long as the placement is the\nleast restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child,\nas provided in [\u00a71915(b)].\u201d Although we need not decide the issue\nhere, it may be the case that an Indian child\u2019s tribe could alter \u00a71915\u2019s\npreferences in a way that includes a biological father whose rights were\nterminated, but who has now reformed. See \u00a71915(c). If a tribe were to\ntake such an approach, however, the court would still have the power to\ndetermine whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to disregard the tribe\u2019s order of\n16               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Nor did other members of the\nCherokee Nation or \u201cother Indian families\u201d seek to adopt\nBaby Girl, even though the Cherokee Nation had notice\nof\u2014and intervened in\u2014the adoption proceedings. See\nBrief for Respondent Cherokee Nation 21\u201322; Reply Brief\nfor Petitioners 13\u201314.12\n                         *     *     *\n  The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted to help pre-\nserve the cultural identity and heritage of Indian tribes,\nbut under the State Supreme Court\u2019s reading, the Act\nwould put certain vulnerable children at a great disad-\nvantage solely because an ancestor\u2014even a remote one\u2014\nwas an Indian.        As the State Supreme Court read\n\u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ), a biological Indian father could abandon\nhis child in utero and refuse any support for the birth\nmother\u2014perhaps contributing to the mother\u2019s decision to\nput the child up for adoption\u2014and then could play his\nICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the\nmother\u2019s decision and the child\u2019s best interests. If this\nwere possible, many prospective adoptive parents would\nsurely pause before adopting any child who might possibly\nqualify as an Indian under the ICWA. Such an interpreta-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\npreference. See \u00a7\u00a71915(a), (c); In re Adoption of T. R. M., 525 N. E. 2d\n298, 313 (Ind. 1988).\n   12 To be sure, an employee of the Cherokee Nation testified that the\n\nCherokee Nation certifies families to be adoptive parents and that\nthere are approximately 100 such families \u201cthat are ready to take\nchildren that want to be adopted.\u201d Record 446. However, this testi-\nmony was only a general statement regarding the Cherokee Nation\u2019s\npractices; it did not demonstrate that a specific Indian family was\nwilling to adopt Baby Girl, let alone that such a family formally sought\nsuch adoption in the South Carolina courts.

Each party in this case has put forward a plausible\ninterpretation of the relevant sections of the Indian Child\nWelfare Act (ICWA). However, the interpretations offered\nby respondent Birth Father and the United States raise\nsignificant constitutional problems as applied to this\ncase. Because the Court\u2019s decision avoids those problems,\nI concur in its interpretation.\n                              I\n  This case arises out of a contested state-court adoption\nproceeding. Adoption proceedings are adjudicated in state\nfamily courts across the country every day, and \u201cdomestic\nrelations\u201d is \u201can area that has long been regarded as a\nvirtually exclusive province of the States.\u201d Sosna v. Iowa,\n419 U. S. 393, 404 (1975). Indeed, \u201c[t]he whole subject of\nthe domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and\nchild, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws\nof the United States.\u201d In re Burrus, 136 U.

Nevertheless, when Adoptive Couple filed a\npetition in South Carolina Family Court to finalize their\nadoption of Baby Girl, Birth Father, who had relinquished\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nhis parental rights via a text message to Birth Mother,\nclaimed a federal right under the ICWA to block the adop-\ntion and to obtain custody.\n   The ICWA establishes \u201cfederal standards that govern\nstate-court child custody proceedings involving Indian\nchildren.\u201d Ante, at 2. The ICWA defines \u201cIndian child\u201d as\n\u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is\neither (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible\nfor membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological\nchild of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71903(4).\nAs relevant, the ICWA defines \u201cchild custody proceeding,\u201d\n\u00a71903(1), to include \u201cadoptive placement,\u201d which means\n\u201cthe permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption,\nincluding any action resulting in a final decree of adop-\ntion,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(iv), and \u201ctermination of parental rights,\u201d\nwhich means \u201cany action resulting in the termination of\nthe parent-child relationship,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(ii).\n   The ICWA restricts a state court\u2019s ability to terminate\nthe parental rights of an Indian parent in two relevant\nways. Section 1912(f) prohibits a state court from involun-\ntarily terminating parental rights \u201cin the absence of a\ndetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses,\nthat the continued custody of the child by the parent or\nIndian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or\nphysical damage to the child.\u201d Section 1912(d) prohibits a\nstate court from terminating parental rights until the\ncourt is satisfied \u201cthat active efforts have been made to\nprovide remedial services and rehabilitative programs\ndesigned to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and\nthat these efforts have proved unsuccessful.\u201d A third\nprovision creates specific placement preferences for the\nadoption of Indian children, which favor placement with\nIndians over other adoptive families. \u00a71915(a). Operating\ntogether, these requirements often lead to different out-\ncomes than would result under state law. That is precisely\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See ante, at 6 (\u201cIt is undisputed\nthat, had Baby Girl not been 3/256 Cherokee, Biological\nFather would have had no right to object to her adoption\nunder South Carolina law\u201d).\n   The ICWA recognizes States\u2019 inherent \u201cjurisdiction over\nIndian child custody proceedings,\u201d \u00a71901(5), but asserts\nthat federal regulation is necessary because States \u201chave\noften failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of\nIndian people and the cultural and social standards pre-\nailing in Indian communities and families,\u201d ibid. However,\nCongress may regulate areas of traditional state concern\nonly if the Constitution grants it such power. Admt. 10\n(\u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-\nserved to the States respectively, or to the people\u201d). The\nthreshold question, then, is whether the Constitution\ngrants Congress power to override state custody law\nwhenever an Indian is involved.\n                              II\n   The ICWA asserts that the Indian Commerce Clause,\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3, and \u201cother constitutional authority\u201d pro-\nvides Congress with \u201cplenary power over Indian affairs.\u201d\n\u00a71901(1). The reference to \u201cother constitutional authority\u201d\nis not illuminating, and I am aware of no other enumer-\nated power that could even arguably support Congress\u2019\nintrusion into this area of traditional state authority. See\nFletcher, The Supreme Court and Federal Indian Policy,\n85 Neb. L. Rev. 121, 137 (2006) (\u201cAs a matter of federal\nconstitutional law, the Indian Commerce Clause grants\nCongress the only explicit constitutional authority to deal\nwith Indian tribes\u201d); Natelson, The Original Understand-\ning of the Indian Commerce Clause, 85 Denver U.

BABY GIRL\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nnary authority must, therefore, stand or fall on Congress\u2019\npower under the Indian Commerce Clause. Although this\nCourt has said that the \u201ccentral function of the Indian\nCommerce Clause is to provide Congress with plenary\npower to legislate in the field of Indian affairs,\u201d Cotton\nPetroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989),\nneither the text nor the original understanding of the\nClause supports Congress\u2019 claim to such \u201cplenary\u201d power.\n                              A\n   The Indian Commerce Clause gives Congress authority\n\u201c[t]o regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian tribes.\u201d\nArt. I, \u00a78, cl. 3 (emphasis added). \u201cAt the time the original\nConstitution was ratified, \u2018commerce\u2019 consisted of selling,\nbuying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these\npurposes.\u201d United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 585\n(1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring). See also 1 S. Johnson, A\nDictionary of the English Language 361 (4th rev. ed. 1773)\n(reprint 1978) (defining commerce as \u201cIntercourse; ex-\nchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing;\ntrade; traffick\u201d). \u201c[W]hen Federalists and Anti-Federalists\ndiscussed the Commerce Clause during the ratification\nperiod, they often used trade (in its selling/bartering\nsense) and commerce interchangeably.\u201d Lopez, supra, at\n586 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The term \u201ccommerce\u201d did\nnot include economic activity such as \u201cmanufacturing and\nagriculture,\u201d ibid., let alone noneconomic activity such as\nadoption of children.\n   Furthermore, the term \u201ccommerce with Indian tribes\u201d\nwas invariably used during the time of the founding to\nmean \u201c \u2018trade with Indians.\u2019 \u201d See, e.g., Natelson, 215\u2013216,\nand n. 97 (citing 18th-century sources); Report of Commit-\ntee on Indian Affairs (Feb 20, 1787), in 32 Journals of the\nContinental Congress 1774\u20131789, pp. 66, 68 (R. Hill ed.\n1936) (hereinafter J. Cont\u2019l Cong.) (using the phrase\n\u201ccommerce with the Indians\u201d to mean trade with the\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

And regulation of Indian commerce generally\nreferred to legal structures governing \u201cthe conduct of\nthe merchants engaged in the Indian trade, the nature of the\ngoods they sold, the prices charged, and similar matters.\u201d\nNatelson 216, and n. 99.\n  The Indian Commerce Clause contains an additional\ntextual limitation relevant to this case: Congress is given\nthe power to regulate Commerce \u201cwith the Indian tribes.\u201d\nThe Clause does not give Congress the power to regulate\ncommerce with all Indian persons any more than the\nForeign Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to\nregulate commerce with all foreign nationals traveling\nwithin the United States. A straightforward reading of\nthe text, thus, confirms that Congress may only regulate\ncommercial interactions\u2014\u201ccommerce\u201d\u2014taking place with\nestablished Indian communities\u2014\u201ctribes.\u201d That power is\nfar from \u201cplenary.\u201d\n                              B\n   Congress\u2019 assertion of \u201cplenary power\u201d over Indian\naffairs is also inconsistent with the history of the Indian\nCommerce Clause. At the time of the founding, the Clause\nwas understood to reserve to the States general police\npowers with respect to Indians who were citizens of the\nseveral States. The Clause instead conferred on Congress\nthe much narrower power to regulate trade with Indian\ntribes\u2014that is, Indians who had not been incorporated\ninto the body-politic of any State.\n                             1\n  Before the Revolution, most Colonies adopted their own\nregulations governing Indian trade. See Natelson 219,\nand n. 121 (citing colonial laws). Such regulations were\nnecessary because colonial traders all too often abused\ntheir Indian trading partners, through fraud, exorbitant\nprices, extortion, and physical invasion of Indian territory,\n6                 ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\namong other things. See 1 F. Prucha, The Great Father\n18\u201320 (1984) (hereinafter Prucha); Natelson 220, and\nn. 122. These abuses sometimes provoked violent Indian\nretaliation. See Prucha 20. To mitigate these conflicts,\nmost Colonies extensively regulated traders engaged in\ncommerce with Indian tribes. See e.g., Ordinance to Regu-\nlate Indian Affairs, Statutes of South Carolina (Aug. 31,\n1751), in 16 Early American Indian Documents: Treaties\nand Laws, 1607\u20131789, pp. 331\u2013334 (A. Vaughan and\nD. Rosen eds. 1998).1 Over time, commercial regulation at\nthe colonial level proved largely ineffective, in part be-\ncause \u201c[t]here was no uniformity among the colonies, no\ntwo sets of like regulations.\u201d Prucha 21.\n   Recognizing the need for uniform regulation of trade\nwith the Indians, Benjamin Franklin proposed his own\n\u201carticles of confederation\u201d to the Continental Congress on\nJuly 21, 1775, which reflected his view that central control\nover Indian affairs should predominate over local control.\n2 J. Cont\u2019l Cong. 195\u2013199 (W. Ford ed. 1905). Franklin\u2019s\nproposal was not enacted, but in November 1775, Con-\ngress empowered a committee to draft regulations for\nthe Indian trade. 3 id., at 364, 366. On July 12, 1776, the\ncommittee submitted a draft of the Articles of Confedera-\ntion to Congress, which incorporated many of Franklin\u2019s\nproposals. 5 id., at 545, 546, n. 1. The draft prohibited\nStates from waging offensive war against the Indians\nwithout congressional authorization and granted Congress\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 South Carolina, for example, required traders to be licensed, to be of\n\ngood moral character, and to post a bond.

Some delegates feared\nthat the Articles gave Congress excessive power to in-\nterfere with States\u2019 jurisdiction over affairs with Indians\nresiding within state boundaries. After further delibera-\ntion, the final result was a clause that included a broad\ngrant of congressional authority with two significant\nexceptions: \u201cThe United States in Congress assembled\nshall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of\n. . . regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the\nIndians, not members of any of the States, provided that\nthe legislative right of any State within its own limits be\nnot infringed or violated.\u201d Articles of Confederation, Art.\nIX, cl. 4. As a result, Congress retained exclusive jurisdic-\ntion over Indian affairs outside the borders of the States;\nthe States retained exclusive jurisdiction over relations\nwith Member-Indians;2 and Congress and the States \u201cex-\nercise[d] concurrent jurisdiction over transactions with\ntribal Indians within state boundaries, but congressional\ndecisions would have to be in compliance with local law.\u201d\nNatelson 230.

This concern\nfor state power reemerged during the drafting of the\nConstitution.\n                              2\n   The drafting history of the Constitutional Convention\nalso supports a limited construction of the Indian Com-\nmerce Clause. On July 24, 1787, the convention elected\na drafting committee\u2014the Committee of Detail\u2014and\ncharged it to \u201creport a Constitution conformable to the Res-\nolutions passed by the Convention.\u201d 2 Records of the\nFederal Convention of 1787, p.106 (M. Farrand rev. 1966)\n(J. Madison). During the Committee\u2019s deliberations, John\nRutledge, the chairman, suggested incorporating an In-\ndian affairs power into the Constitution. Id., at 137, n. 6,\n143. The first draft reported back to the convention,\nhowever, provided Congress with authority \u201c[t]o regulate\ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several\nStates,\u201d id., at 181 (Madison) (Aug. 6, 1787), but did not\ninclude any specific Indian affairs clause.

States.\u201d Id., at 324 (J. Madi-\nson) (emphasis added). On August 22, Rutledge delivered\nthe Committee of Detail\u2019s second report, which modified\nMadison\u2019s proposed clause.

That Committee recommended adding\nto the Commerce Clause the phrase, \u201cand with the Indian\ntribes,\u201d id., at 493, which the Convention ultimately\nadopted.\n   It is, thus, clear that the Framers of the Constitution\nwere alert to the difference between the power to regulate\ntrade with the Indians and the power to regulate all In-\ndian affairs. By limiting Congress\u2019 power to the former, the\nFramers declined to grant Congress the same broad pow-\ners over Indian affairs conferred by the Articles of Confed-\neration. See Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89\nCornell L. Rev. 1069, 1090 (2004).\n   During the ratification debates, opposition to the Indian\nCommerce Clause was nearly nonexistent. See Natelson\n248 (noting that Robert Yates, a New York Anti-Federalist\nwas \u201calmost the only writer who objected to any part [of ]\nof the Commerce Clause\u2014a clear indication that its scope\nwas understood to be fairly narrow\u201d (footnote omitted)).\nGiven the Anti-Federalists\u2019 vehement opposition to the\nConstitution\u2019s other grants of power to the Federal Gov-\nernment, this silence is revealing. The ratifiers almost\ncertainly understood the Clause to confer a relatively\nmodest power on Congress\u2014namely, the power to regulate\ntrade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders. And\nthis feature of the Constitution was welcomed by Federal-\nists and Anti-Federalists alike due to the considerable\ninterest in expanding trade with such Indian tribes. See,\ne.g., The Federalist No. 42, at 265 (J. Madison) (praising\nthe Constitution for removing the obstacles that had\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation to federal\ncontrol over \u201ctrade with Indians\u201d (emphasis added)); 3 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 580 (2d ed. 1863)\n(Adam Stephens, at the Virginia ratifying convention,\nJune 23, 1788, describing the Indian tribes residing near\n10            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Saladino eds.\n2012) (conceding that there must be a standing army for\nsome purposes, including \u201ctrade with Indians\u201d). There is\nlittle evidence that the ratifiers of the Constitution under-\nstood the Indian Commerce Clause to confer anything\nresembling plenary power over Indian affairs. See Natel-\nson 247\u2013250.\n                            III\n  In light of the original understanding of the Indian\nCommerce Clause, the constitutional problems that would\nbe created by application of the ICWA here are evident.\nFirst, the statute deals with \u201cchild custody proceedings,\u201d\n\u00a71903(1), not \u201ccommerce.\u201d It was enacted in response to\nconcerns that \u201can alarmingly high percentage of Indian\nfamilies [were] broken up by the removal, often unwar-\nranted, of their children from them by nontribal public\nand private agencies.\u201d \u00a71901(4). The perceived problem\nwas that many Indian children were \u201cplaced in non-Indian\nfoster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d Ibid. This\nproblem, however, had nothing to do with commerce.\n  Second, the portions of the ICWA at issue here do not\nregulate Indian tribes as tribes. Sections 1912(d) and (f ),\nand \u00a71915(a) apply to all child custody proceedings involv-\ning an Indian child, regardless of whether an Indian tribe\nis involved. This case thus does not directly implicate\nCongress\u2019 power to \u201clegislate in respect to Indian tribes.\u201d\nUnited States v. Lara, 541 U. S. 193, 200 (2004) (emphasis\nadded). Baby Girl was never domiciled on an Indian\nReservation, and the Cherokee Nation had no jurisdiction\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                  11\n\n                        THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nover her. Cf. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.\nHolyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 53\u201354 (1989) (holding that the\nIndian Tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over child custody\nproceedings, even though the children were born off the\nreservation, because the children were \u201cdomiciled\u201d on the\nreservation for purposes of the ICWA). Although Birth\nFather is a registered member of The Cherokee Nation, he\ndid not live on a reservation either. He was, thus, subject\nto the laws of the State in which he resided (Oklahoma)\nand of the State where his daughter resided during the\ncustody proceedings (South Carolina). Nothing in the In-\ndian Commerce Clause permits Congress to enact spe-\ncial laws applicable to Birth Father merely because of his\nstatus as an Indian.3\n  Because adoption proceedings like this one involve\nneither \u201ccommerce\u201d nor \u201cIndian tribes,\u201d there is simply no\nconstitutional basis for Congress\u2019 assertion of authority\nover such proceedings. Also, the notion that Congress can\ndirect state courts to apply different rules of evidence and\nprocedure merely because a person of Indian descent is\ninvolved raises absurd possibilities. Such plenary power\nwould allow Congress to dictate specific rules of criminal\nprocedure for state-court prosecutions against Indian\ndefendants. Likewise, it would allow Congress to substi-\ntute federal law for state law when contract disputes\ninvolve Indians. But the Constitution does not grant\nCongress power to override state law whenever that law\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Petitioners and the guardian ad litem contend that applying the\n\nICWA to child custody proceedings on the basis of race implicates equal\nprotection concerns. See Brief for Petitioners 45 (arguing that the\nstatute would be unconstitutional \u201cif unwed fathers with no preexisting\nsubstantive parental rights receive a statutory preference based solely\non the Indian child\u2019s race\u201d); Brief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem\n48\u201349 (same). I need not address this argument because I am satisfied\nthat Congress lacks authority to regulate the child custody proceedings\nin this case.\n12            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Accordingly, application\nof the ICWA to these child custody proceedings would be\nunconstitutional.\n                        *   *   *\n  Because the Court\u2019s plausible interpretation of the\nrelevant sections of the ICWA avoids these constitutional\nproblems, I concur.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

First,\nthe statute does not directly explain how to treat an ab-\nsentee Indian father who had next-to-no involvement with\nhis child in the first few months of her life. That category\nof fathers may include some who would prove highly un-\nsuitable parents, some who would be suitable, and a range\nof others in between. Most of those who fall within that\ncategory seem to fall outside the scope of the language of\n25 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ). Thus, while I agree that the\nbetter reading of the statute is, as the majority concludes,\nto exclude most of those fathers, ante, at 8, 12, I also un-\nderstand the risk that, from a policy perspective, the\nCourt\u2019s interpretation could prove to exclude too many.\nSee post, at 13, 22\u201323 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Second, we should decide here no more than is neces-\nsary. Thus, this case does not involve a father with visita-\ntion rights or a father who has paid \u201call of his child\nsupport obligations.\u201d See post, at 13. Neither does it involve\nspecial circumstances such as a father who was deceived\nabout the existence of the child or a father who was pre-\nvented from supporting his child. See post, at 13 n. 8. The\nCourt need not, and in my view does not, now decide\nwhether or how \u00a7\u00a71912(d) and (f ) apply where those cir-\n2              ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                      BREYER, J., concurring\n\ncumstances are present.\n  Third, other statutory provisions not now before us may\nnonetheless prove relevant in cases of this kind. Section\n1915(a) grants an adoptive \u201cpreference\u201d to \u201c(1) a member\nof the child\u2019s extended family; (2) other members of the\nIndian child\u2019s tribe; or (3) other Indian families . . . . in the\nabsence of good cause to the contrary.\u201d Further, \u00a71915(c)\nallows the \u201cIndian child\u2019s tribe\u201d to \u201cestablish a different\norder of preference by resolution.\u201d Could these provisions\nallow an absentee father to re-enter the special statutory\norder of preference with support from the tribe, and sub-\nject to a court\u2019s consideration of \u201cgood cause?\u201d I raise, but\ndo not here try to answer, the question.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I reject the conclusion that the Court draws from\nthe words \u201ccontinued custody\u201d in 25 U. S. C \u00a71912(f) not\nbecause \u201cliteralness may strangle meaning,\u201d see post, at\n11, but because there is no reason that \u201ccontinued\u201d must\nrefer to custody in the past rather than custody in the\nfuture. I read the provision as requiring the court to\nsatisfy itself (beyond a reasonable doubt) not merely that\ninitial or temporary custody is not \u201clikely to result in\nserious emotional or physical damage to the child,\u201d but\nthat continued custody is not likely to do so. See Web-\nster\u2019s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed. 1950)\n(defining \u201ccontinued\u201d as \u201c[p]rotracted in time or space, esp.\nwithout interruption; constant\u201d). For the reasons set forth\nin JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s dissent, that connotation is much\nmore in accord with the rest of the statute.\n  While I am at it, I will add one thought. The Court\u2019s\nopinion, it seems to me, needlessly demeans the rights of\nparenthood. It has been the constant practice of the com-\nmon law to respect the entitlement of those who bring a\nchild into the world to raise that child. We do not inquire\nwhether leaving a child with his parents is \u201cin the best\ninterest of the child.\u201d It sometimes is not; he would be\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

In truth, however, the path from the text of\nthe Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to the result the\nCourt reaches is anything but clear, and its result any\u00ad\nthing but right.\n   The reader\u2019s first clue that the majority\u2019s supposedly\nstraightforward reasoning is flawed is that not all Mem\u00ad\nbers who adopt its interpretation believe it is compelled by\nthe text of the statute, see ante, at 1 (THOMAS, J., concur\u00ad\nring); nor are they all willing to accept the consequences\nit will necessarily have beyond the specific factual sce-\nnario confronted here, see ante, at 1 (BREYER, J., concurring).\nThe second clue is that the majority begins its analysis by\nplucking out of context a single phrase from the last clause\nof the last subsection of the relevant provision, and then\nbuilds its entire argument upon it. That is not how we\nordinarily read statutes. The third clue is that the major-\nity openly professes its aversion to Congress\u2019 explicitly\nstated purpose in enacting the statute. The majority ex-\n2             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npresses concern that reading the Act to mean what it\nsays will make it more difficult to place Indian children in\nadoptive homes, see ante, at 14, 16, but the Congress that\nenacted the statute announced its intent to stop \u201can\nalarmingly high percentage of Indian families [from being]\nbroken up\u201d by, among other things, a trend of \u201cplac[ing]\n[Indian children] in non-Indian . . . adoptive homes.\u201d 25\nU. S. C. \u00a71901(4). Policy disagreement with Congress\u2019 judg-\nment is not a valid reason for this Court to distort the pro\u00ad\nvisions of the Act. Unlike the majority, I cannot adopt\na reading of ICWA that is contrary to both its text and its\nstated purpose. I respectfully dissent.\n                               I\n  Beginning its reading with the last clause of \u00a71912(f ),\nthe majority concludes that a single phrase appearing\nthere\u2014\u201ccontinued custody\u201d\u2014means that the entirety of\nthe subsection is inapplicable to any parent, however\ncommitted, who has not previously had physical or legal\ncustody of his child. Working back to front, the majority\nthen concludes that \u00a71912(d), tainted by its association\nwith \u00a71912(f ), is also inapplicable; in the majority\u2019s view,\na family bond that does not take custodial form is not a\nfamily bond worth preserving from \u201cbreakup.\u201d Because\nthere are apparently no limits on the contaminating power\nof this single phrase, the majority does not stop there.\nUnder its reading, \u00a71903(9), which makes biological fa\u00ad\nthers \u201cparent[s]\u201d under this federal statute (and where,\nagain, the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d does not appear),\nhas substantive force only when a birth father has physi\u00ad\ncal or state-recognized legal custody of his daughter.\n  When it excludes noncustodial biological fathers from\nthe Act\u2019s substantive protections, this textually backward\nreading misapprehends ICWA\u2019s structure and scope.\nMoreover, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s focus on the per-\nceived parental shortcomings of Birth Father, its rea\u00ad\n                   Cite as: 570 U.

The majority thereby trans\u00ad\nforms a statute that was intended to provide uniform\nfederal standards for child custody proceedings involving\nIndian children and their biological parents into an illogi\u00ad\ncal piecemeal scheme.\n                               A\n   Better to start at the beginning and consider the opera\u00ad\ntion of the statute as a whole. Cf. ante, at 13 (\u201c[S]tatutory\nconstruction \u2018is a holistic endeavor[,]\u2019 and . . . \u2018[a] provision\nthat may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by\nthe remainder of the statutory scheme\u2019 \u201d (quoting United\nSav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,\nLtd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988))).\n   ICWA commences with express findings. Congress rec\u00ad\nognized that \u201cthere is no resource that is more vital to\nthe continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than\ntheir children,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71901(3), and it found that this\nresource was threatened. State authorities insufficiently\nsensitive to \u201cthe essential tribal relations of Indian people\nand the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian\ncommunities and families\u201d were breaking up Indian fami\u00ad\nlies and moving Indian children to non-Indian homes and\ninstitutions. See \u00a7\u00a71901(4)\u2013(5). As \u00a71901(4) makes clear,\nand as this Court recognized in Mississippi Band of\nChoctaw Indians v. Holyfield, 490 U. S. 30, 33 (1989),\nadoptive placements of Indian children with non-Indian\nfamilies contributed significantly to the overall problem. See\n\u00a71901(4) (finding that \u201can alarmingly high percentage of\n[Indian] children are placed in non-Indian . . . adoptive\nhomes\u201d).\n   Consistent with these findings, Congress declared its\npurpose \u201cto protect the best interests of Indian children\n4             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Section 1903 then goes on to\nestablish the reach of these protections through its defi-\nnitional provisions. For present purposes, two of these\ndefinitions are crucial to understanding the statute\u2019s full\nscope.\n   First, ICWA defines the term \u201cparent\u201d broadly to mean\n\u201cany biological parent . . . of an Indian child or any In-\ndian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child.\u201d\n\u00a71903(9). It is undisputed that Baby Girl is an \u201cIndian\nchild\u201d within the meaning of the statute, see \u00a71903(4);\nante, at 2, n. 1, and Birth Father consequently qualifies\nas a \u201cparent\u201d under the Act. The statutory definition of\nparent \u201cdoes not include the unwed father where paternity\nhas not been acknowledged or established,\u201d \u00a71903(9), but\nBirth Father\u2019s biological paternity has never been ques\u00ad\ntioned by any party and was confirmed by a DNA test\nduring the state court proceedings, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n109a (Sealed).\n   Petitioners and Baby Girl\u2019s guardian ad litem devote\nmany pages of briefing to arguing that the term \u201cparent\u201d\nshould be defined with reference to the law of the State in\nwhich an ICWA child custody proceeding takes place. See\nBrief for Petitioners 19\u201329; Brief for Respondent Guardian\nAd Litem 32\u201341. These arguments, however, are incon\u00ad\nsistent with our recognition in Holyfield that Congress\nintended the critical terms of the statute to have uniform\nfederal definitions. See 490 U. S., at 44\u201345. It is therefore\nunsurprising, although far from unimportant, that the\nmajority assumes for the purposes of its analysis that\nBirth Father is an ICWA \u201cparent.\u201d See ante, at 7.\n   Second, the Act\u2019s comprehensive definition of \u201cchild\ncustody proceeding\u201d includes not only \u201c \u2018adoptive place\u00ad\nment[s],\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018preadoptive placement[s],\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018foster care\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

This last category encompasses\n\u201cany action resulting in the termination of the parent-\nchild relationship,\u201d \u00a71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added). So far,\nthen, it is clear that Birth Father has a federally recog\u00ad\nnized status as Baby Girl\u2019s \u201cparent\u201d and that his \u201cparent\u00ad\nchild relationship\u201d with her is subject to the protections of\nthe Act.\n  These protections are numerous. Had Birth Father\npetitioned to remove this proceeding to tribal court, for\nexample, the state court would have been obligated to\ntransfer it absent an objection from Birth Mother or good\ncause to the contrary. See \u00a71911(b). Any voluntary con\u00ad\nsent Birth Father gave to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption would have\nbeen invalid unless written and executed before a judge\nand would have been revocable up to the time a final\ndecree of adoption was entered.1 See \u00a7\u00a71913(a), (c). And\n\u00a71912, the center of the dispute here, sets forth procedural\nand substantive standards applicable in \u201cinvoluntary\nproceeding[s] in a State court,\u201d including foster care\nplacements of Indian children and termination of paren\u00ad\ntal rights proceedings. \u00a71912(a). I consider \u00a71912\u2019s provi\u00ad\nsions in order.\n  Section 1912(a) requires that any party seeking \u201ctermi\u00ad\nnation of parental rights t[o] an Indian child\u201d provide\nnotice to both the child\u2019s \u201cparent or Indian custodian\u201d\nand the child\u2019s tribe \u201cof the pending proceedings and of\ntheir right of intervention.\u201d Section 1912(b) mandates\nthat counsel be provided for an indigent \u201cparent or In-\ndian custodian\u201d in any \u201ctermination proceeding.\u201d Section\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For this reason, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Birth\n\nFather did not give valid consent to Baby Girl\u2019s adoption when, four\nmonths after her birth, he signed papers stating that he accepted\nservice and was not contesting the adoption. See 398 S. C. 625, 645\u2013\n646, 731 S. E. 2d 550, 561 (2012). See also ante, at 5.

Although the Constitution does not compel the\nprotection of a biological father\u2019s parent-child relationship\nuntil he has taken steps to cultivate it, this Court has\nnevertheless recognized that \u201cthe biological connection . . .\noffers the natural father an opportunity that no other\nmale possesses to develop a relationship with his off\u00ad\nspring.\u201d Lehr v.

Having assumed a uniform federal\ndefinition of \u201cparent\u201d that confers certain procedural\nrights, the majority then illogically concludes that ICWA\u2019s\nsubstantive protections are available only to a subset of\n\u201cparent[s]\u201d: those who have previously had physical or\nstate-recognized legal custody of his or her child. The\nstatute does not support this departure.\n  Section 1912(d) provides that\n        \u201cAny party seeking to effect a foster care placement\n     of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child\n     under State law shall satisfy the court that active\n     efforts have been made to provide remedial services\n     and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the\n     breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts\n     have proved unsuccessful.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nIn other words, subsection (d) requires that an attempt\nbe made to cure familial deficiencies before the drastic\nmeasures of foster care placement or termination of paren\u00ad\ntal rights can be taken.\n  The majority would hold that the use of the phrase\n\u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u201d in this subsection means\nthat it does not apply where a birth father has not previ\u00ad\nously had custody of his child. Ante, at 12. But there is\nnothing about this capacious phrase that licenses such a\nnarrowing construction. As the majority notes, \u201cbreakup\u201d\nmeans \u201c \u2018[t]he discontinuance of a relationship.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n12 (quoting American Heritage Dictionary 235 (3d ed.\n1992)).

Nothing in the text of subsection (d)\nindicates that this blood relationship should be excluded\nfrom the category of familial \u201crelationships\u201d that the pro-\nvision aims to save from \u201cdiscontinuance.\u201d\n   The majority, reaching the contrary conclusion, asserts\nbaldly that \u201cwhen an Indian parent abandons an Indian\nchild prior to birth and that child has never been in the\nIndian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody, there is no \u2018rela\u00ad\ntionship\u2019 that would be \u2018discontinu[ed]\u2019 . . . by the termina\u00ad\ntion of the Indian parent\u2019s rights.\u201d Ante, at 12. Says who?\nCertainly not the statute. Section 1903 recognizes Birth\nFather as Baby Girl\u2019s \u201cparent,\u201d and, in conjunction with\nICWA\u2019s other provisions, it further establishes that their\n\u201cparent-child relationship\u201d is protected under federal law.\nIn the face of these broad definitions, the majority has no\nwarrant to substitute its own policy views for Congress\u2019 by\nsaying that \u201cno \u2018relationship\u2019 \u201d exists between Birth Father\nand Baby Girl simply because, based on the hotly con-\ntested facts of this case, it views their family bond as in-\nsufficiently substantial to deserve protection.3 Ibid.\n   The majority states that its \u201cinterpretation of \u00a71912(d)\nis . . . confirmed by the provision\u2019s placement next to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority\u2019s discussion of \u00a71912(d) repeatedly references Birth\n\nFather\u2019s purported \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d of Baby Girl, ante, at 12, 13, n. 8,\n14, and it contends that its holding with regard to this provision is\nlimited to such circumstances, see ante, at 13, n. 8; see also ante, at 1\n(BREYER, J., concurring). While I would welcome any limitations on the\nmajority\u2019s holding given that it is contrary to the language and purpose\nof the statute, the majority never explains either the textual basis or\nthe precise scope of its \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation. I expect that the\nmajority\u2019s inexact use of the term \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d will sow confusion,\nbecause it is a commonly used term of art in state family law that does\nnot have a uniform meaning from State to State. See generally 1 J.\nHollinger, Adoption Law and Practice \u00a74.04[1][a][ii] (2012) (discussing\nvarious state-law standards for establishing parental abandonment of\na child).\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

This is the only aspect of\nthe majority\u2019s argument regarding \u00a71912(d) that is based\non ICWA\u2019s actual text rather than layers of assertion su-\nperimposed on the text; but the conclusion the majority\ndraws from the juxtaposition of these provisions is exactly\nbackward.\n  Section 1912(f ) is paired with \u00a71912(e), and as the ma\u00ad\njority notes, both come on the heels of the requirement of\nrehabilitative efforts just reviewed. The language of the\ntwo provisions is nearly identical; subsection (e) is headed\n\u201cFoster care placement orders,\u201d and subsection (f ), the\nrelevant provision here, is headed \u201cParental rights termi\u00ad\nnation orders.\u201d Subsection (f ) reads in its entirety,\n       \u201cNo termination of parental rights may be ordered\n     in such proceeding in the absence of a determination,\n     supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, in\u00ad\n     cluding testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that\n     the continued custody of the child by the parent or In\u00ad\n     dian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional\n     or physical damage to the child.\u201d \u00a71912(f ).4\nThe immediate inference to be drawn from the statute\u2019s\nstructure is that subsections (e) and (f ) work in tandem\nwith the rehabilitative efforts required by (d). Under\nsubsection (d), state authorities must attempt to provide\n\u201cremedial services and rehabilitative programs\u201d aimed at\navoiding foster care placement or termination of parental\nrights; (e) and (f ), in turn, bar state authorities from order\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The full text of subsection (e) is as follows:\n   \u201cNo foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in\nthe absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evi-\ndence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the\ncontinued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is\nlikely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d\n\u00a71912(e).\n10               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

Nothing in\nsubsections (a) through (d) suggests a limitation on the\ntypes of parental relationships that are protected by any of\nthe provisions of \u00a71912, and there is nothing in the struc\u00ad\nture of \u00a71912 that would lead a reader to expect subsection\n(e) or (f ) to introduce any such qualification. Indeed, both\nsubsections, in their opening lines, refer back to the prior\nprovisions of \u00a71912 with the phrase \u201cin such proceeding.\u201d\nThis language indicates, quite logically, that in actions\nwhere subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) apply, (e) and (f )\napply too.5\n   All this, and still the most telling textual evidence is yet\nto come: The text of the subsection begins by announcing,\n\u201c[n]o termination of parental rights may be ordered\u201d un\u00ad\nless the specified evidentiary showing is made. To repeat,\na \u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d includes \u201cany action\nresulting in the termination of the parent-child relation\u00ad\nship,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71903(1)(ii) (emphasis added), includ-\ning the relationship Birth Father, as an ICWA \u201cparent,\u201d\nhas with Baby Girl. The majority\u2019s reading disregards\nthe Act\u2019s sweeping definition of \u201ctermination of parental\nrights,\u201d which is not limited to terminations of custodial\nrelationships.\n  The entire foundation of the majority\u2019s argument that\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 For these reasons, I reject the argument advanced by the United\n\nStates that subsection (d) applies in the circumstances of this case but\nsubsection (f ) does not. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n24\u201326. The United States\u2019 position is contrary to the interrelated\nnature of \u00a7\u00a71912(d), (e), and (f ). Under the reading that the United\nStates proposes, in a case such as this one the curative provision would\nstand alone; ICWA would provide no evidentiary or substantive stand\u00ad\nards by which to measure whether foster care placement or termination\nof parental rights could be ordered in the event that rehabilitative\nefforts did not succeed. Such a scheme would be oddly incomplete.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

S. 337, 341\u2013345 (1997) (noting that a term that\nmay \u201c[a]t first blush\u201d seem unambiguous can prove other\u00ad\nwise when examined in the context of the statute as a\nwhole).6 In light of the structure of \u00a71912, which indicates\nthat subsection (f ) is applicable to the same actions to\nwhich subsections (a) through (d) are applicable; the use of\nthe phrase \u201csuch proceeding[s]\u201d at the start of subsection\n(f ) to reinforce this structural inference; and finally, the\nprovision\u2019s explicit statement that it applies to \u201ctermina\u00ad\ntion of parental rights\u201d proceedings, the necessary conclu\u00ad\nsion is that the word \u201ccustody\u201d does not strictly denote a\nstate-recognized custodial relationship. If one refers back\nto the Act\u2019s definitional section, this conclusion is not\nsurprising. Section 1903(1) includes \u201cany action resulting\nin the termination of the parent-child relationship\u201d within\nthe meaning of \u201cchild custody proceeding,\u201d thereby belying\nany congressional intent to give the term \u201ccustody\u201d a\nnarrow and exclusive definition throughout the statute.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 The majority\u2019s interpretation is unpersuasive even if one focuses\n\nexclusively on the phrase \u201ccontinued custody\u201d because, as JUSTICE\nSCALIA explains, ante, at 1 (dissenting opinion), nothing about the\nadjective \u201ccontinued\u201d mandates the retrospective, rather than prospec\u00ad\ntive, application of \u00a71912(f )\u2019s standard.\n12               ADOPTIVE COUPLE v.

A court applying \u00a71912(f ) where the\nparent does not have pre-existing custody should, as Birth\nFather argues, determine whether the party seeking ter\u00ad\nmination of parental rights has established that the con\u00ad\ntinuation of the parent-child relationship will result in\n\u201cserious emotional or physical damage to the child.\u201d7\n   The majority is willing to assume, for the sake of argu\u00ad\nment, that Birth Father is a \u201cparent\u201d within the meaning\nof ICWA. But the majority fails to account for all that\nfollows from that assumption. The majority repeatedly\npasses over the term \u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d that,\nas defined by \u00a71903, clearly encompasses an action aimed\nat severing Birth Father\u2019s \u201cparent-child relationship\u201d with\nBaby Girl. The majority chooses instead to focus on\nphrases not statutorily defined that it then uses to exclude\nBirth Father from the benefits of his parental status.\nWhen one must disregard a statute\u2019s use of terms that\nhave been explicitly defined by Congress, that should be a\nsignal that one is distorting, rather than faithfully read\u00ad\ning, the law in question.\n                              B\n     The majority also does not acknowledge the full impli\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The majority overlooks Birth Father\u2019s principal arguments when it\n\ndismisses his reading of \u00a71912(f ) as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Ante, at 8. He does\nargue that if one accepts petitioners\u2019 view that it is impossible to make\na determination of likely harm when a parent lacks custody, then the\nconsequence would be that \u201c \u2018[n]o termination of parental rights may be\nordered.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent Birth Father 39 (quoting \u00a71912(f )).\nBut Birth Father\u2019s primary arguments assume that it is indeed possible\nto make a determination of likely harm in the circumstances of this\ncase, and that parental rights can be terminated if \u00a71912(f ) is met.

Its dis\u00ad\ncussion focuses on Birth Father\u2019s particular actions, but\nnothing in the majority\u2019s reasoning limits its manufac\u00ad\ntured class of semiprotected ICWA parents to biological\nfathers who failed to support their child\u2019s mother during\npregnancy. Its logic would apply equally to noncustodial\nfathers who have actively participated in their child\u2019s\nupbringing.\n  Consider an Indian father who, though he has never had\ncustody of his biological child, visits her and pays all of his\nchild support obligations.8 Suppose that, due to deficien\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The   majority attempts to minimize the consequences of its holding\nby asserting that the parent-child relationships of noncustodial fathers\nwith visitation rights will be at stake in an ICWA proceeding in only\n\u201ca relatively small class of cases.\u201d Ante, at 13, n. 8. But it offers no\nsupport for this assertion, beyond speculating that there will not be\nmany fathers affected by its interpretation of \u00a71912(d) because it is\nqualified by an \u201cabandon[ment]\u201d limitation.

In any event,\nthis example by no means exhausts the class of semiprotected ICWA\nparents that the majority\u2019s opinion creates. It also includes, for exam\u00ad\nple, biological fathers who have not yet established a relationship with\ntheir child because the child\u2019s mother never informed them of the\npregnancy, see, e.g., In re Termination of Parental Rights of Biological\nParents of Baby Boy W., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196234\"><a href=\"/okla/78AJ/in-re-baby-boy-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 988 P. 2d 1270, told them falsely\nthat the pregnancy ended in miscarriage or termination, see, e.g., A\nChild\u2019s Hope, LLC v.

Presumably the court con\u00ad\nsidering the adoption petition would have to apply some\nstandard to determine whether termination of his paren\u00ad\ntal rights was appropriate. But from whence would that\nstandard come?\n  Not from the statute Congress drafted, according to the\nmajority. The majority suggests that it might come from\nstate law. See ante, at 13, n. 8. But it is incongruous to\nsuppose that Congress intended a patchwork of federal\nand state law to apply in termination of parental rights\nproceedings. Congress enacted a statute aimed at protect\u00ad\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   The majority expresses the concern that my reading of the statute\nwould produce \u201cfar-reaching consequences,\u201d because \u201ceven a sperm\ndonor\u201d would be entitled to ICWA\u2019s protections. Ante, at 13\u201314, n. 8. If\nthere are any examples of women who go to the trouble and expense of\nartificial insemination and then carry the child to term, only to put the\nchild up for adoption or be found so unfit as mothers that state authori\u00ad\nties attempt an involuntary adoptive placement\u2014thereby necessitating\ntermination of the parental rights of the sperm donor father\u2014the ma\u00ad\njority does not cite them. As between a possibly overinclusive in\u00ad\nterpretation of the statute that covers this unlikely class of cases, and\nthe majority\u2019s underinclusive interpretation that has the very real\nconsequence of denying ICWA\u2019s protections to all noncustodial biologi\u00ad\ncal fathers, it is surely the majority\u2019s reading that is contrary to ICWA\u2019s\ndesign.\n   9 With a few exceptions not relevant here, before a final decree of\n\nadoption may be entered, one of two things must happen: \u201cthe biological\nparents must either voluntarily relinquish their parental rights or have\ntheir rights involuntarily terminated.\u201d 2A.

(quoting Parham v. J. R., 442 U.

Some\nStates, like South Carolina, have opted to hew to the con\u00ad\nstitutional baseline established by this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents and do not require a biological father\u2019s consent to\nadoption unless he has provided financial support during\npregnancy. See Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246, 254\u2013\n256 (1978); Lehr, 463 U. S., at 261. Other States, how-\never, have decided to give the rights of biological fathers\nmore robust protection and to afford them consent rights\non the basis of their biological link to the child. At the\ntime that ICWA was passed, as noted, over one-fourth of\nStates did so. See supra, at 17\u201318.\n   ICWA, on a straightforward reading of the statute, is\nconsistent with the law of those States that protected, and\nprotect, birth fathers\u2019 rights more vigorously. This read\u00ad\ning can hardly be said to generate an anomaly. ICWA, as\nall acknowledge, was \u201cthe product of rising concern . . .\n[about] abusive child welfare practices that resulted in the\nseparation of large numbers of Indian children from their\nfamilies.\u201d Holyfield, 490 U.

Ante, at 14, 16. This claim is the most perplex\u00ad\ning of all. A central purpose of ICWA is to \u201cpromote the\nstability and security of Indian . . . families,\u201d 25 U. S. C.\n\u00a71902, in part by countering the trend of placing \u201can\nalarmingly high percentage of [Indian] children . . . in non-\nIndian foster and adoptive homes and institutions.\u201d\n\u00a71901(4). The Act accomplishes this goal by, first, protect\u00ad\ning the familial bonds of Indian parents and children, see\nsupra, at 4\u201312; and, second, establishing placement pref\u00ad\nerences should an adoption take place, see \u00a71915(a).\nICWA does not interfere with the adoption of Indian chil\u00ad\ndren except to the extent that it attempts to avert the\nnecessity of adoptive placement and makes adoptions of\nIndian children by non-Indian families less likely.\n  The majority may consider this scheme unwise. But\nno principle of construction licenses a court to interpret a\nstatute with a view to averting the very consequences\nCongress expressly stated it was trying to bring about.\nInstead, it is the \u201c \u2018judicial duty to give faithful meaning to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   14 It bears emphasizing that the ICWA standard for termination of\n\nparental rights of which Birth Father claims the benefit is more protec\u00ad\ntive than, but not out of step with, the clear and convincing standard\ngenerally applied in state courts when termination of parental rights\nis sought. Birth Father does not claim that he is entitled to custody\nof Baby Girl unless petitioners can satisfy the demanding standard of\n\u00a71912(f ). See Brief for Respondent Birth Father 40, n. 15. The ques\u00ad\ntion of custody would be analyzed independently, as it was by the South\nCarolina Supreme Court. Of course, it will often be the case that cus\u00ad\ntody is subsequently granted to a child\u2019s fit parent, consistent with\nthe presumption that a natural parent will act in the best interests of\nhis child.

While there\nare indications that central among Congress\u2019 concerns\nin enacting ICWA was the removal of Indian children\nfrom homes in which Indian parents or other guardians\nhad custody of them, see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71901(4), 1902, Con-\ngress also recognized that \u201cthere is no resource that is\nmore vital to the continued existence and integrity of\nIndian tribes than their children,\u201d \u00a71901(3). As we ob\u00ad\nserved in Holyfield, ICWA protects not only Indian par\u00ad\nents\u2019 interests but also those of Indian tribes. See 490\nU. S., at 34, 52. A tribe\u2019s interest in its next generation of\ncitizens is adversely affected by the placement of Indian\nchildren in homes with no connection to the tribe, whether\nor not those children were initially in the custody of an\nIndian parent.15\n   Moreover, the majority\u2019s focus on \u201cintact\u201d families, ante,\nat 10, begs the question of what Congress set out to ac\u00ad\ncomplish with ICWA. In an ideal world, perhaps all\nparents would be perfect. They would live up to their\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  15 BirthFather is a registered member of the Cherokee Nation, a fact\nof which Birth Mother was aware at the time of her pregnancy and of\nwhich she informed her attorney. See 398 S. C. 625, 632\u2013633, 731 S. E.\n2d 550, 554 (2012).\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                 23\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nparental responsibilities by providing the fullest possible\nfinancial and emotional support to their children. They\nwould never suffer mental health problems, lose their jobs,\nstruggle with substance dependency, or encounter any of\nthe other multitudinous personal crises that can make it\ndifficult to meet these responsibilities. In an ideal world\nparents would never become estranged and leave their\nchildren caught in the middle. But we do not live in\nsuch a world. Even happy families do not always fit the\ncustodial-parent mold for which the majority would reserve\nIWCA\u2019s substantive protections; unhappy families all too\noften do not. They are families nonetheless. Congress\nunderstood as much. ICWA\u2019s definitions of \u201cparent\u201d and\n\u201ctermination of parental rights\u201d provided in \u00a71903 sweep\nbroadly. They should be honored.\n                              D\n  The majority does not rely on the theory pressed by\npetitioners and the guardian ad litem that the canon of\nconstitutional avoidance compels the conclusion that ICWA\nis inapplicable here. See Brief for Petitioners 43\u201351;\nBrief for Respondent Guardian Ad Litem 48\u201358. It\nstates instead that it finds the statute clear.16 Ante, at 17.\nBut the majority nevertheless offers the suggestion that a\ncontrary result would create an equal protection problem.\nIbid. Cf. Brief for Petitioners 44\u201347; Brief for Respondent\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 JUSTICE THOMAS concurs in the majority\u2019s interpretation because,\nalthough he finds the statute susceptible of more than one plausible\nreading, he believes that the majority\u2019s reading avoids \u201csignificant\nconstitutional problems\u201d concerning whether ICWA exceeds Congress\u2019\nauthority under the Indian Commerce Clause. Ante, at 1, 3\u201312. No\nparty advanced this argument, and it is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s\nprecedents holding that Congress has \u201cbroad general powers to leg-\nislate in respect to Indian tribes, powers that we have consistently\ndescribed as plenary and exclusive,\u201d founded not only on the Indian\nCommerce Clause but also the Treaty Clause. United States v. Lara,\n541 U. S. 193, 200\u2013201 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n24             ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nGuardian Ad Litem 53\u201355.\n   It is difficult to make sense of this suggestion in light of\nour precedents, which squarely hold that classifications\nbased on Indian tribal membership are not impermissible\nracial classifications. See United States v. Antelope, 430\nU. S. 641, 645\u2013647 (1977); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S.\n535, 553\u2013554 (1974). The majority\u2019s repeated, analytically\nunnecessary references to the fact that Baby Girl is 3/256\nCherokee by ancestry do nothing to elucidate its intima\u00ad\ntion that the statute may violate the Equal Protection\nClause as applied here. See ante, at 1, 6; see also ante,\nat 16 (stating that ICWA \u201cwould put certain vulner-\nable children at a great disadvantage solely because an\nancestor\u2014even a remote one\u2014was an Indian\u201d (emphasis\nadded)). I see no ground for this Court to second-guess the\nmembership requirements of federally recognized Indian\ntribes, which are independent political entities. See Santa\nClara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 72, n. 32 (1978).\nI am particularly averse to doing so when the Federal\nGovernment requires Indian tribes, as a prerequisite for\nofficial recognition, to make \u201cdescen[t] from a historical\nIndian tribe\u201d a condition of membership. 25 CFR \u00a783.7(e)\n(2012).\n   The majority\u2019s treatment of this issue, in the end, does\nno more than create a lingering mood of disapprobation of\nthe criteria for membership adopted by the Cherokee\nNation that, in turn, make Baby Girl an \u201cIndian child\u201d\nunder the statute. Its hints at lurking constitutional\nproblems are, by its own account, irrelevant to its statutory\nanalysis, and accordingly need not detain us any longer.\n                           III\n  Because I would affirm the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt on the ground that \u00a71912 bars the termination of\nBirth Father\u2019s parental rights, I would not reach the\nquestion of the applicability of the adoptive placement\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           25\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\npreferences of \u00a71915. I note, however, that the majority\ndoes not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on re\u00ad\nmand, Baby Girl\u2019s paternal grandparents or other mem\u00ad\nbers of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for\nadoption of Baby Girl. If these parties do so, and if on\nremand Birth Father\u2019s parental rights are terminated so\nthat an adoption becomes possible, they will then be enti\u00ad\ntled to consideration under the order of preference estab\u00ad\nlished in \u00a71915. The majority cannot rule prospectively\nthat \u00a71915 would not apply to an adoption petition that\nhas not yet been filed. Indeed, the statute applies \u201c[i]n\nany adoptive placement of an Indian child under State\nlaw,\u201d 25 U. S. C. \u00a71915(a) (emphasis added), and contains\nno temporal qualifications. It would indeed be an odd\nresult for this Court, in the name of the child\u2019s best in-\nterests, cf. ante, at 15, to purport to exclude from the pro\u00ad\nceedings possible custodians for Baby Girl, such as her\npaternal grandparents, who may have well-established\nrelationships with her.\n                         *    *    *\n   The majority opinion turns \u00a71912 upside down, reading\nit from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is\nmanifestly contrary to Congress\u2019 express purpose in enact\u00ad\ning ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian\nparents and their children and, more broadly, Indian\ntribes\u2019 relationships with the future citizens who are \u201cvital\nto [their] continued existence and integrity.\u201d \u00a71901(3).\n   The majority casts Birth Father as responsible for the\npainful circumstances in this case, suggesting that he\nintervened \u201cat the eleventh hour to override the mother\u2019s\ndecision and the child\u2019s best interests,\u201d ante, at 16. I have\nno wish to minimize the trauma of removing a 27-month\u00ad\nold child from her adoptive family. It bears remembering,\nhowever, that Birth Father took action to assert his paren\u00ad\ntal rights when Baby Girl was four months old, as soon as\n26            ADOPTIVE COUPLE v. BABY GIRL\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhe learned of the impending adoption. As the South Caro\u00ad\nlina Supreme Court recognized, \u201c \u2018[h]ad the mandate of . . .\nICWA been followed [in 2010], . . . much potential anguish\nmight have been avoided[;] and in any case the law cannot\nbe applied so as automatically to \u201creward those who obtain\ncustody, whether lawfully or otherwise, and maintain it\nduring any ensuing (and protracted) litigation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 398\nS. C., at 652, 731 S. E. 2d, at 564 (quoting Holyfield, 490\nU. S., at 53\u201354).\n   The majority\u2019s hollow literalism distorts the statute and\nignores Congress\u2019 purpose in order to rectify a perceived\nwrong that, while heartbreaking at the time, was a correct\napplication of federal law and that in any case cannot be\nundone. Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18\nmonths. However difficult it must have been for her to\nleave Adoptive Couple\u2019s home when she was just over 2\nyears old, it will be equally devastating now if, at the age\nof 3\u00bd, she is again removed from her home and sent to live\nhalfway across the country. Such a fate is not foreor\u00ad\ndained, of course. But it can be said with certainty that\nthe anguish this case has caused will only be compounded\nby today\u2019s decision.\n   I believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s\njudgment was correct, and I would affirm it. I respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>",
