WINDSOR, EXECUTOR OF THE \n\n              ESTATE OF SPYER, ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 12\u2013307.      Argued March 27, 2013\u2014Decided June 26, 2013\nThe State of New York recognizes the marriage of New York residents\n  Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, who wed in Ontario, Canada, in\n  2007. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.\n  Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviv-\n  ing spouses, but was barred from doing so by \u00a73 of the federal De-\n  fense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which amended the Dictionary Act\u2014a\n  law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and\n  the whole realm of federal regulations\u2014to define \u201cmarriage\u201d and\n  \u201cspouse\u201d as excluding same-sex partners. Windsor paid $363,053 in\n  estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service\n  denied. Windsor brought this refund suit, contending that DOMA vi-\n  olates the principles of equal protection incorporated in the Fifth\n  Amendment. While the suit was pending, the Attorney General noti-\n  fied the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Depart-\n  ment of Justice would no longer defend \u00a73\u2019s constitutionality. In re-\n  sponse, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of\n  Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend \u00a73\u2019s\n  constitutionality. The District Court permitted the intervention. On\n  the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding \u00a73 un-\n  constitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsor\u2019s tax\n  with interest. The Second Circuit affirmed. The United States has\n  not complied with the judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.\n This case clearly presented a concrete disagreement between oppos-\n ing parties that was suitable for judicial resolution in the District\n Court, but the Executive\u2019s decision not to defend \u00a73\u2019s constitutionali-\n2                     UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    ty in court while continuing to deny refunds and assess deficiencies\n    introduces a complication. Given the Government\u2019s concession, ami-\n    cus contends, once the District Court ordered the refund, the case\n    should have ended and the appeal been dismissed. But this argu-\n    ment elides the distinction between Article III\u2019s jurisdictional re-\n    quirements and the prudential limits on its exercise, which are \u201ces-\n    sentially matters of judicial self-governance.\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422\n    U. S. 490, 500. Here, the United States retains a stake sufficient to\n    support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in this Court. The re-\n    fund it was ordered to pay Windsor is \u201ca real and immediate econom-\n    ic injury,\u201d Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S.\n    587, 599, even if the Executive disagrees with \u00a73 of DOMA. Wind-\n    sor\u2019s ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay\n    thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n    Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.\n       Prudential considerations, however, demand that there be \u201ccon-\n    crete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon\n    which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult consti-\n    tutional questions.\u201d Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204. Unlike Article\n    III requirements\u2014which must be satisfied by the parties before judi-\n    cial consideration is appropriate\u2014prudential factors that counsel\n    against hearing this case are subject to \u201ccountervailing considera-\n    tions [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluc-\n    tance to exert judicial power.\u201d Warth, supra, at 500\u2013501. One such\n    consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the\n    issues is ensured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to de-\n    fend with vigor the legislative act\u2019s constitutionality. See Chadha,\n    supra, at 940. Here, BLAG\u2019s substantial adversarial argument for\n    \u00a73\u2019s constitutionality satisfies prudential concerns that otherwise\n    might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which\n    the principal parties agree. This conclusion does not mean that it is\n    appropriate for the Executive as a routine exercise to challenge stat-\n    utes in court instead of making the case to Congress for amendment\n    or repeal. But this case is not routine, and BLAG\u2019s capable defense\n    ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question,\n    which is of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to\n    hundreds of thousands of persons. Pp. 5\u201313.\n       2. DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of\n    persons that is protected by the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 13\u201326.\n          (a) By history and tradition the definition and regulation of mar-\n    riage has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the\n    separate States. Congress has enacted discrete statutes to regulate\n    the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy, but\n    DOMA, with a directive applicable to over 1,000 federal statues and\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthe whole realm of federal regulations, has a far greater reach. Its\noperation is also directed to a class of persons that the laws of New\nYork, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect. Assessing the\nvalidity of that intervention requires discussing the historical and\ntraditional extent of state power and authority over marriage.\n   Subject to certain constitutional guarantees, see, e.g., Loving v.\nVirginia, 388 U. S. 1, \u201cregulation of domestic relations\u201d is \u201can area\nthat has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the\nStates,\u201d Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 404. The significance of state\nresponsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to\nthe Nation\u2019s beginning; for \u201cwhen the Constitution was adopted the\ncommon understanding was that the domestic relations of husband\nand wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States,\u201d\nOhio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379, 383\u2013384. Marriage laws\nmay vary from State to State, but they are consistent within each\nState.\n   DOMA rejects this long-established precept. The State\u2019s decision\nto give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a\ndignity and status of immense import. But the Federal Government\nuses the state-defined class for the opposite purpose\u2014to impose re-\nstrictions and disabilities. The question is whether the resulting in-\njury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment, since what New York treats as\nalike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the\nsame class the State seeks to protect. New York\u2019s actions were a\nproper exercise of its sovereign authority. They reflect both the\ncommunity\u2019s considered perspective on the historical roots of the in-\nstitution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning\nof equality. Pp. 13\u201320.\n     (b) By seeking to injure the very class New York seeks to protect,\nDOMA violates basic due process and equal protection principles ap-\nplicable to the Federal Government. The Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nequality \u201cmust at the very least mean that a bare congressional de-\nsire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot\u201d justify disparate\ntreatment of that group. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413\nU. S. 528, 534\u2013535. DOMA cannot survive under these principles.\nIts unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting\nstate definitions of marriage operates to deprive same-sex couples of\nthe benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of\ntheir marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose\nand effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state\nlaw. DOMA\u2019s avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a\ndisadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter\ninto same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority\n4                    UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of the States.\n       DOMA\u2019s history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that\n    interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, conferred\n    by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than\n    an incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence. BLAG\u2019s\n    arguments are just as candid about the congressional purpose.\n    DOMA\u2019s operation in practice confirms this purpose. It frustrates\n    New York\u2019s objective of eliminating inequality by writing inequality\n    into the entire United States Code.\n       DOMA\u2019s principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of\n    state-sanctioned marriages. It contrives to deprive some couples\n    married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights\n    and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes\n    within the same State. It also forces same-sex couples to live as mar-\n    ried for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of\n    federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic\n    personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and\n    protect.

EDITH SCHLAIN\n  WINDSOR, IN HER CAPACITY AS EXECUTOR OF THE\n     ESTATE OF THEA CLARA SPYER, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 26, 2013]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Two women then resident in New York were married\nin a lawful ceremony in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. Edith\nWindsor and Thea Spyer returned to their home in New\nYork City. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire\nestate to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the estate tax\nexemption for surviving spouses. She was barred from\ndoing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Mar-\nriage Act, which excludes a same-sex partner from the\ndefinition of \u201cspouse\u201d as that term is used in federal stat-\nutes. Windsor paid the taxes but filed suit to challenge\nthe constitutionality of this provision. The United States\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that this\nportion of the statute is unconstitutional and ordered the\nUnited States to pay Windsor a refund. This Court granted\ncertiorari and now affirms the judgment in Windsor\u2019s\nfavor.\n                           I\n  In 1996, as some States were beginning to consider the\nconcept of same-sex marriage, see, e.g., Baehr v. Lewin, 74\n2               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHaw. 530, 852 P. 2d 44 (1993), and before any State had\nacted to permit it, Congress enacted the Defense of Mar-\nriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419. DOMA contains two\noperative sections: Section 2, which has not been chal-\nlenged here, allows States to refuse to recognize same-sex\nmarriages performed under the laws of other States. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71738C.\n  Section 3 is at issue here. It amends the Dictionary Act\nin Title 1, \u00a77, of the United States Code to provide a fed-\neral definition of \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cspouse.\u201d Section 3 of\nDOMA provides as follows:\n      \u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Con-\n    gress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of\n    the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the\n    United States, the word \u2018marriage\u2019 means only a\n    legal union between one man and one woman as hus-\n    band and wife, and the word \u2018spouse\u2019 refers only to a\n    person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\u201d\n    1 U. S. C. \u00a77.\n  The definitional provision does not by its terms forbid\nStates from enacting laws permitting same-sex marriages\nor civil unions or providing state benefits to residents in\nthat status. The enactment\u2019s comprehensive definition of\nmarriage for purposes of all federal statutes and other\nregulations or directives covered by its terms, however,\ndoes control over 1,000 federal laws in which marital or\nspousal status is addressed as a matter of federal law. See\nGAO, D. Shah, Defense of Marriage Act: Update to Prior\nReport 1 (GAO\u201304\u2013353R, 2004).\n  Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York City in\n1963 and began a long-term relationship. Windsor and\nSpyer registered as domestic partners when New York\nCity gave that right to same-sex couples in 1993. Con-\ncerned about Spyer\u2019s health, the couple made the 2007 trip\nto Canada for their marriage, but they continued to reside\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nin New York City. The State of New York deems their\nOntario marriage to be a valid one. See 699 F. 3d 169,\n177\u2013178 (CA2 2012).\n  Spyer died in February 2009, and left her entire estate\nto Windsor. Because DOMA denies federal recognition to\nsame-sex spouses, Windsor did not qualify for the marital\nexemption from the federal estate tax, which excludes\nfrom taxation \u201cany interest in property which passes or\nhas passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse.\u201d 26\nU. S. C. \u00a72056(a). Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes\nand sought a refund. The Internal Revenue Service de-\nnied the refund, concluding that, under DOMA, Windsor\nwas not a \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d        Windsor commenced\nthis refund suit in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York.         She contended\nthat DOMA violates the guarantee of equal protection,\nas applied to the Federal Government through the Fifth\nAmendment.\n  While the tax refund suit was pending, the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States notified the Speaker of the\nHouse of Representatives, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7530D,\nthat the Department of Justice would no longer defend the\nconstitutionality of DOMA\u2019s \u00a73. Noting that \u201cthe Depart-\nment has previously defended DOMA against . . . chal-\nlenges involving legally married same-sex couples,\u201d App.\n184, the Attorney General informed Congress that \u201cthe\nPresident has concluded that given a number of factors,\nincluding a documented history of discrimination, classifi-\ncations based on sexual orientation should be subject to\na heightened standard of scrutiny.\u201d Id., at 191. The De-\npartment of Justice has submitted many \u00a7530D letters\nover the years refusing to defend laws it deems unconsti-\ntutional, when, for instance, a federal court has rejected\nthe Government\u2019s defense of a statute and has issued a\njudgment against it. This case is unusual, however, be-\ncause the \u00a7530D letter was not preceded by an adverse\n4               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment. The letter instead reflected the Executive\u2019s\nown conclusion, relying on a definition still being debated\nand considered in the courts, that heightened equal pro-\ntection scrutiny should apply to laws that classify on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.\n   Although \u201cthe President . . . instructed the Department\nnot to defend the statute in Windsor,\u201d he also decided\n\u201cthat Section 3 will continue to be enforced by the Execu-\ntive Branch\u201d and that the United States had an \u201cinterest\nin providing Congress a full and fair opportunity to partic-\nipate in the litigation of those cases.\u201d Id., at 191\u2013193. The\nstated rationale for this dual-track procedure (determina-\ntion of unconstitutionality coupled with ongoing enforce-\nment) was to \u201crecogniz[e] the judiciary as the final arbiter\nof the constitutional claims raised.\u201d Id., at 192.\n   In response to the notice from the Attorney General,\nthe Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House\nof Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to\ndefend the constitutionality of \u00a73 of DOMA. The Depart-\nment of Justice did not oppose limited intervention by\nBLAG. The District Court denied BLAG\u2019s motion to enter\nthe suit as of right, on the rationale that the United States\nalready was represented by the Department of Justice.\nThe District Court, however, did grant intervention by\nBLAG as an interested party. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n24(a)(2).\n   On the merits of the tax refund suit, the District Court\nruled against the United States. It held that \u00a73 of DOMA\nis unconstitutional and ordered the Treasury to refund the\ntax with interest. Both the Justice Department and BLAG\nfiled notices of appeal, and the Solicitor General filed a\npetition for certiorari before judgment. Before this Court\nacted on the petition, the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. It applied\nheightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual\norientation, as both the Department and Windsor had\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nurged. The United States has not complied with the judg-\nment. Windsor has not received her refund, and the Ex-\necutive Branch continues to enforce \u00a73 of DOMA.\n   In granting certiorari on the question of the constitu-\ntionality of \u00a73 of DOMA, the Court requested argument\non two additional questions: whether the United States\u2019\nagreement with Windsor\u2019s legal position precludes further\nreview and whether BLAG has standing to appeal the\ncase. All parties agree that the Court has jurisdiction to\ndecide this case; and, with the case in that framework, the\nCourt appointed Professor Vicki Jackson as amicus curiae\nto argue the position that the Court lacks jurisdiction to\nhear the dispute. 568 U. S. ___ (2012). She has ably\ndischarged her duties.\n   In an unrelated case, the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the First Circuit has also held \u00a73 of DOMA to be\nunconstitutional. A petition for certiorari has been filed in\nthat case. Pet. for Cert. in Bipartisan Legal Advisory\nGroup v. Gill, O. T. 2012, No. 12\u201313.\n                               II\n  It is appropriate to begin by addressing whether either\nthe Government or BLAG, or both of them, were entitled\nto appeal to the Court of Appeals and later to seek certio-\nrari and appear as parties here.\n  There is no dispute that when this case was in the\nDistrict Court it presented a concrete disagreement be-\ntween opposing parties, a dispute suitable for judicial\nresolution. \u201c[A] taxpayer has standing to challenge the\ncollection of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional;\nbeing forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate\neconomic injury to the individual taxpayer.\u201d Hein v. Free\u00ad\ndom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599\n(2007) (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). Windsor\nsuffered a redressable injury when she was required to\npay estate taxes from which, in her view, she was exempt\n6               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut for the alleged invalidity of \u00a73 of DOMA.\n   The decision of the Executive not to defend the constitu-\ntionality of \u00a73 in court while continuing to deny refunds\nand to assess deficiencies does introduce a complication.\nEven though the Executive\u2019s current position was an-\nnounced before the District Court entered its judgment,\nthe Government\u2019s agreement with Windsor\u2019s position would\nnot have deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to\nentertain and resolve the refund suit; for her injury (fail-\nure to obtain a refund allegedly required by law) was\nconcrete, persisting, and unredressed. The Government\u2019s\nposition\u2014agreeing with Windsor\u2019s legal contention but\nrefusing to give it effect\u2014meant that there was a justicia-\nble controversy between the parties, despite what the\nclaimant would find to be an inconsistency in that stance.\nWindsor, the Government, BLAG, and the amicus appear\nto agree upon that point. The disagreement is over the\nstanding of the parties, or aspiring parties, to take an\nappeal in the Court of Appeals and to appear as parties in\nfurther proceedings in this Court.\n   The amicus\u2019 position is that, given the Government\u2019s\nconcession that \u00a73 is unconstitutional, once the District\nCourt ordered the refund the case should have ended;\nand the amicus argues the Court of Appeals should have\ndismissed the appeal. The amicus submits that once\nthe President agreed with Windsor\u2019s legal position and the\nDistrict Court issued its judgment, the parties were no\nlonger adverse. From this standpoint the United States\nwas a prevailing party below, just as Windsor was. Ac-\ncordingly, the amicus reasons, it is inappropriate for this\nCourt to grant certiorari and proceed to rule on the merits;\nfor the United States seeks no redress from the judgment\nentered against it.\n   This position, however, elides the distinction between\ntwo principles: the jurisdictional requirements of Article\nIII and the prudential limits on its exercise. See Warth v.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSeldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975). The latter are \u201cessen-\ntially matters of judicial self-governance.\u201d Id., at 500.\nThe Court has kept these two strands separate: \u201cArticle\nIII standing, which enforces the Constitution\u2019s case-or-\ncontroversy requirement, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 559\u2013562 (1992); and prudential standing,\nwhich embodies \u2018judicially self-imposed limits on the exer-\ncise of federal jurisdiction,\u2019 Allen [v. Wright,] 468 U. S.\n[737,] 751 [(1984)].\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.\nNewdow, 542 U. S. 1, 11\u201312 (2004).\n   The requirements of Article III standing are familiar:\n    \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in\n    fact\u2019\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which\n    is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or\n    imminent, not \u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d \u2019 Second,\n    there must be a causal connection between the injury\n    and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury has to be\n    \u2018fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\n    defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independ-\n    ent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\n    Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018specu-\n    lative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a favor-\n    able decision.\u2019 \u201d Lujan, supra, at 560\u2013561 (footnote and\n    citations omitted).\nRules of prudential standing, by contrast, are more flex-\nible \u201crule[s] . . . of federal appellate practice,\u201d Deposit\nGuaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333 (1980),\ndesigned to protect the courts from \u201cdecid[ing] abstract\nquestions of wide public significance even [when] other\ngovernmental institutions may be more competent to ad-\ndress the questions and even though judicial intervention\nmay be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u201d Warth,\nsupra, at 500.\n  In this case the United States retains a stake sufficient\nto support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in pro-\n8               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings before this Court. The judgment in question\norders the United States to pay Windsor the refund she\nseeks. An order directing the Treasury to pay money is \u201ca\nreal and immediate economic injury,\u201d Hein, 551 U. S., at\n599, indeed as real and immediate as an order directing\nan individual to pay a tax. That the Executive may wel-\ncome this order to pay the refund if it is accompanied by\nthe constitutional ruling it wants does not eliminate the\ninjury to the national Treasury if payment is made, or to\nthe taxpayer if it is not. The judgment orders the United\nStates to pay money that it would not disburse but for the\ncourt\u2019s order. The Government of the United States has a\nvalid legal argument that it is injured even if the Execu-\ntive disagrees with \u00a73 of DOMA, which results in Wind-\nsor\u2019s liability for the tax. Windsor\u2019s ongoing claim for\nfunds that the United States refuses to pay thus estab-\nlishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\nIt would be a different case if the Executive had taken\nthe further step of paying Windsor the refund to which she\nwas entitled under the District Court\u2019s ruling.\n   This Court confronted a comparable case in INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983). A statute by its terms\nallowed one House of Congress to order the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service (INS) to deport the respondent\nChadha. There, as here, the Executive determined that\nthe statute was unconstitutional, and \u201cthe INS presented\nthe Executive\u2019s views on the constitutionality of the House\naction to the Court of Appeals.\u201d Id., at 930. The INS,\nhowever, continued to abide by the statute, and \u201cthe INS\nbrief to the Court of Appeals did not alter the agency\u2019s\ndecision to comply with the House action ordering depor-\ntation of Chadha.\u201d Ibid. This Court held \u201cthat the INS\nwas sufficiently aggrieved by the Court of Appeals deci-\nsion prohibiting it from taking action it would otherwise\ntake,\u201d ibid., regardless of whether the agency welcomed\nthe judgment.

S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfy Article III was defined as a requirement that the\nCourt\u2019s \u201c \u2018decision will have real meaning: if we rule for\nChadha, he will not be deported; if we uphold [the stat-\nute], the INS will execute its order and deport him.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 939\u2013940 (quoting Chadha v. INS, 634 F. 2d 408, 419\n(CA9 1980)). This conclusion was not dictum. It was a\nnecessary predicate to the Court\u2019s holding that \u201cprior to\nCongress\u2019 intervention, there was adequate Art. III ad-\nverseness.\u201d 462 U. S., at 939. The holdings of cases are\ninstructive, and the words of Chadha make clear its hold-\ning that the refusal of the Executive to provide the relief\nsought suffices to preserve a justiciable dispute as re-\nquired by Article III. In short, even where \u201cthe Govern-\nment largely agree[s] with the opposing party on the\nmerits of the controversy,\u201d there is sufficient adverseness\nand an \u201cadequate basis for jurisdiction in the fact that\nthe Government intended to enforce the challenged law\nagainst that party.\u201d Id., at 940, n. 12.\n   It is true that \u201c[a] party who receives all that he has\nsought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment afford-\ning the relief and cannot appeal from it.\u201d Roper, supra, at\n333, see also Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 8) (\u201cAs a matter of practice and prudence, we\nhave generally declined to consider cases at the request of\na prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us\nto do so\u201d). But this rule \u201cdoes not have its source in the\njurisdictional limitations of Art. III. In an appropriate\ncase, appeal may be permitted . . . at the behest of the\nparty who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that\nparty retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the require-\nments of Art. III.\u201d Roper, supra, at 333\u2013334.\n   While these principles suffice to show that this case\npresents a justiciable controversy under Article III, the\nprudential problems inherent in the Executive\u2019s unusual\nposition require some further discussion. The Executive\u2019s\nagreement with Windsor\u2019s legal argument raises the risk\n10               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthat instead of a \u201c \u2018real, earnest and vital controversy,\u2019 \u201d\nthe Court faces a \u201cfriendly, non-adversary, proceeding . . .\n[in which] \u2018a party beaten in the legislature [seeks to]\ntransfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality\nof the legislative act.\u2019 \u201d Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S.\n288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (quoting Chicago\n& Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339,\n345 (1892)). Even when Article III permits the exercise\nof federal jurisdiction, prudential considerations demand\nthat the Court insist upon \u201cthat concrete adverseness\nwhich sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the\ncourt so largely depends for illumination of difficult consti-\ntutional questions.\u201d Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204\n(1962).\n   There are, of course, reasons to hear a case and issue a\nruling even when one party is reluctant to prevail in its\nposition. Unlike Article III requirements\u2014which must\nbe satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is\nappropriate\u2014the relevant prudential factors that counsel\nagainst hearing this case are subject to \u201ccountervailing\nconsiderations [that] may outweigh the concerns underly-\ning the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.\u201d Warth,\n422 U. S., at 500\u2013501. One consideration is the extent to\nwhich adversarial presentation of the issues is assured by\nthe participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with\nvigor the constitutionality of the legislative act. With\nrespect to this prudential aspect of standing as well, the\nChadha Court encountered a similar situation. It noted\nthat \u201cthere may be prudential, as opposed to Art. III,\nconcerns about sanctioning the adjudication of [this case]\nin the absence of any participant supporting the validity of\n[the statute]. The Court of Appeals properly dispelled any\nsuch concerns by inviting and accepting briefs from both\nHouses of Congress.\u201d 462 U. S., at 940. Chadha was not\nan anomaly in this respect. The Court adopts the practice\nof entertaining arguments made by an amicus when the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitor General confesses error with respect to a judg-\nment below, even if the confession is in effect an admission\nthat an Act of Congress is unconstitutional. See, e.g.,\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000).\n   In the case now before the Court the attorneys for BLAG\npresent a substantial argument for the constitutionality\nof \u00a73 of DOMA. BLAG\u2019s sharp adversarial presentation of\nthe issues satisfies the prudential concerns that otherwise\nmight counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision\nwith which the principal parties agree. Were this Court\nto hold that prudential rules require it to dismiss the case,\nand, in consequence, that the Court of Appeals erred in\nfailing to dismiss it as well, extensive litigation would\nensue. The district courts in 94 districts throughout the\nNation would be without precedential guidance not only in\ntax refund suits but also in cases involving the whole of\nDOMA\u2019s sweep involving over 1,000 federal statutes and a\nmyriad of federal regulations. For instance, the opinion of\nthe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, addressing the\nvalidity of DOMA in a case involving regulations of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, likely would\nbe vacated with instructions to dismiss, its ruling and\nguidance also then erased. See Massachusetts v. United\nStates Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F. 3d 1\n(CA1 2012). Rights and privileges of hundreds of thou-\nsands of persons would be adversely affected, pending a\ncase in which all prudential concerns about justiciability\nare absent. That numerical prediction may not be certain,\nbut it is certain that the cost in judicial resources and\nexpense of litigation for all persons adversely affected\nwould be immense. True, the very extent of DOMA\u2019s\nmandate means that at some point a case likely would\narise without the prudential concerns raised here; but the\ncosts, uncertainties, and alleged harm and injuries likely\nwould continue for a time measured in years before the\nissue is resolved. In these unusual and urgent circum-\n12              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances, the very term \u201cprudential\u201d counsels that it is a\nproper exercise of the Court\u2019s responsibility to take juris-\ndiction. For these reasons, the prudential and Article III\nrequirements are met here; and, as a consequence, the\nCourt need not decide whether BLAG would have stand-\ning to challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling and its affir-\nmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG\u2019s own authority.\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion that this petition may be heard\non the merits does not imply that no difficulties would\nensue if this were a common practice in ordinary cases.\nThe Executive\u2019s failure to defend the constitutionality of\nan Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet\nestablished in judicial decisions has created a procedural\ndilemma. On the one hand, as noted, the Government\u2019s\nagreement with Windsor raises questions about the pro-\npriety of entertaining a suit in which it seeks affirmance of\nan order invalidating a federal law and ordering the United\nStates to pay money. On the other hand, if the Execu-\ntive\u2019s agreement with a plaintiff that a law is unconsti-\ntutional is enough to preclude judicial review, then the\nSupreme Court\u2019s primary role in determining the constitu-\ntionality of a law that has inflicted real injury on a plain-\ntiff who has brought a justiciable legal claim would\nbecome only secondary to the President\u2019s. This would\nundermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers\nprinciple that \u201cwhen an Act of Congress is alleged to con-\nflict with the Constitution, \u2018[i]t is emphatically the prov-\nince and duty of the judicial department to say what the\nlaw is.\u2019 \u201d Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 7) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n177 (1803)). Similarly, with respect to the legislative\npower, when Congress has passed a statute and a Presi-\ndent has signed it, it poses grave challenges to the separa-\ntion of powers for the Executive at a particular moment to\nbe able to nullify Congress\u2019 enactment solely on its own\ninitiative and without any determination from the Court.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court\u2019s jurisdictional holding, it must be under-\nscored, does not mean the arguments for dismissing this\ndispute on prudential grounds lack substance. Yet the\ndifficulty the Executive faces should be acknowledged.\nWhen the Executive makes a principled determination\nthat a statute is unconstitutional, it faces a difficult\nchoice. Still, there is no suggestion here that it is appro-\npriate for the Executive as a matter of course to challenge\nstatutes in the judicial forum rather than making the case\nto Congress for their amendment or repeal. The integrity\nof the political process would be at risk if difficult consti-\ntutional issues were simply referred to the Court as a\nroutine exercise. But this case is not routine. And the\ncapable defense of the law by BLAG ensures that these\nprudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which\nis one of immediate importance to the Federal Govern-\nment and to hundreds of thousands of persons. These cir-\ncumstances support the Court\u2019s decision to proceed to the\nmerits.\n                             III\n   When at first Windsor and Spyer longed to marry, nei-\nther New York nor any other State granted them that\nright. After waiting some years, in 2007 they traveled to\nOntario to be married there. It seems fair to conclude\nthat, until recent years, many citizens had not even con-\nsidered the possibility that two persons of the same sex\nmight aspire to occupy the same status and dignity as that\nof a man and woman in lawful marriage. For marriage\nbetween a man and a woman no doubt had been thought\nof by most people as essential to the very definition of that\nterm and to its role and function throughout the history of\ncivilization. That belief, for many who long have held it,\nbecame even more urgent, more cherished when chal-\nlenged. For others, however, came the beginnings of a\nnew perspective, a new insight. Accordingly some States\n14              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluded that same-sex marriage ought to be given\nrecognition and validity in the law for those same-sex\ncouples who wish to define themselves by their commit-\nment to each other. The limitation of lawful marriage\nto heterosexual couples, which for centuries had been\ndeemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be\nseen in New York and certain other States as an unjust\nexclusion.\n   Slowly at first and then in rapid course, the laws of\nNew York came to acknowledge the urgency of this issue for\nsame-sex couples who wanted to affirm their commitment\nto one another before their children, their family, their\nfriends, and their community. And so New York recog-\nnized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere; and then\nit later amended its own marriage laws to permit same-\nsex marriage. New York, in common with, as of this writ-\ning, 11 other States and the District of Columbia, decided\nthat same-sex couples should have the right to marry and\nso live with pride in themselves and their union and in a\nstatus of equality with all other married persons. After a\nstatewide deliberative process that enabled its citizens to\ndiscuss and weigh arguments for and against same-\nsex marriage, New York acted to enlarge the definition of\nmarriage to correct what its citizens and elected repre-\nsentatives perceived to be an injustice that they had not\nearlier known or understood. See Marriage Equality Act,\n2011 N. Y. Laws 749 (codified at N. Y. Dom. Rel. Law Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a710\u2013a, 10\u2013b, 13 (West 2013)).\n   Against this background of lawful same-sex marriage\nin some States, the design, purpose, and effect of DOMA\nshould be considered as the beginning point in deciding\nwhether it is valid under the Constitution. By history and\ntradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will\nbe discussed in more detail, has been treated as being\nwithin the authority and realm of the separate States. Yet\nit is further established that Congress, in enacting dis-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrete statutes, can make determinations that bear on\nmarital rights and privileges. Just this Term the Court\nupheld the authority of the Congress to pre-empt state\nlaws, allowing a former spouse to retain life insurance\nproceeds under a federal program that gave her priority,\nbecause of formal beneficiary designation rules, over the\nwife by a second marriage who survived the husband.\nHillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___ (2013); see also Ridgway\nv. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46 (1981); Wissner v. Wissner, 338\nU. S. 655 (1950). This is one example of the general prin-\nciple that when the Federal Government acts in the exer-\ncise of its own proper authority, it has a wide choice of the\nmechanisms and means to adopt. See McCulloch v. Mary\u00ad\nland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819). Congress has the power\nboth to ensure efficiency in the administration of its pro-\ngrams and to choose what larger goals and policies to\npursue.\n   Other precedents involving congressional statutes which\naffect marriages and family status further illustrate this\npoint. In addressing the interaction of state domestic\nrelations and federal immigration law Congress deter-\nmined that marriages \u201centered into for the purpose of\nprocuring an alien\u2019s admission [to the United States] as an\nimmigrant\u201d will not qualify the noncitizen for that status,\neven if the noncitizen\u2019s marriage is valid and proper for\nstate-law purposes. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71186a(b)(1) (2006 ed. and\nSupp. V). And in establishing income-based criteria for\nSocial Security benefits, Congress decided that although\nstate law would determine in general who qualifies as an\napplicant\u2019s spouse, common-law marriages also should be\nrecognized, regardless of any particular State\u2019s view on\nthese relationships. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71382c(d)(2).\n   Though these discrete examples establish the constitu-\ntionality of limited federal laws that regulate the meaning\nof marriage in order to further federal policy, DOMA has a\nfar greater reach; for it enacts a directive applicable to\n16               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nover 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal\nregulations. And its operation is directed to a class of\npersons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States,\nhave sought to protect. See Goodridge v. Department of\nPublic Health, 440 Mass. 309, 798 N.

State laws defining and regulating marriage, of\ncourse, must respect the constitutional rights of persons,\nsee, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); but, subject\nto those guarantees, \u201cregulation of domestic relations\u201d is\n\u201can area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclu-\nsive province of the States.\u201d Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n404 (1975).\n    The recognition of civil marriages is central to state\ndomestic relations law applicable to its residents and\ncitizens. See Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287,\n298 (1942) (\u201cEach state as a sovereign has a rightful and\nlegitimate concern in the marital status of persons domi-\nciled within its borders\u201d). The definition of marriage is\nthe foundation of the State\u2019s broader authority to regulate\nthe subject of domestic relations with respect to the\n\u201c[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the en-\nforcement of marital responsibilities.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[T]he states,\nat the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed\nfull power over the subject of marriage and divorce\n. . . [and] the Constitution delegated no authority to the\nGovernment of the United States on the subject of mar-\nriage and divorce.\u201d Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562,\n575 (1906); see also In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593\u2013594\n(1890) (\u201cThe whole subject of the domestic relations of\nhusband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws\nof the States and not to the laws of the United States\u201d).\n    Consistent with this allocation of authority, the Federal\nGovernment, through our history, has deferred to state-\nlaw policy decisions with respect to domestic relations. In\nDe Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U. S. 570 (1956), for example,\nthe Court held that, \u201c[t]o decide who is the widow or wid-\nower of a deceased author, or who are his executors or\nnext of kin,\u201d under the Copyright Act \u201crequires a reference\nto the law of the State which created those legal relation-\nships\u201d because \u201cthere is no federal law of domestic rela-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 580. In order to respect this principle, the\nfederal courts, as a general rule, do not adjudicate issues\nof marital status even when there might otherwise be a\nbasis for federal jurisdiction. See Ankenbrandt v. Rich\u00ad\nards, 504 U. S. 689, 703 (1992). Federal courts will not\nhear divorce and custody cases even if they arise in diver-\nsity because of \u201cthe virtually exclusive primacy . . . of the\n18              UNITED STATES v.

Popovici v. Agler, 280\nU. S. 379, 383\u2013384 (1930). Marriage laws vary in some\nrespects from State to State. For example, the required\nminimum age is 16 in Vermont, but only 13 in New\nHampshire. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a75142 (2012),\nwith N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7457:4 (West Supp. 2012).\nLikewise the permissible degree of consanguinity can vary\n(most States permit first cousins to marry, but a handful\u2014\nsuch as Iowa and Washington, see Iowa Code \u00a7595.19\n(2009); Wash. Rev. Code \u00a726.04.020 (2012)\u2014prohibit the\npractice). But these rules are in every event consistent\nwithin each State.\n   Against this background DOMA rejects the long-\nestablished precept that the incidents, benefits, and obli-\ngations of marriage are uniform for all married couples\nwithin each State, though they may vary, subject to con-\nstitutional guarantees, from one State to the next. De-\nspite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide\nwhether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation\nof the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance.\nThe State\u2019s power in defining the marital relation is of\ncentral relevance in this case quite apart from principles\nof federalism. Here the State\u2019s decision to give this class\nof persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity\nand status of immense import. When the State used its\nhistoric and essential authority to define the marital\nrelation in this way, its role and its power in making the\ndecision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection\nof the class in their own community. DOMA, because of\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits reach and extent, departs from this history and tra-\ndition of reliance on state law to define marriage. \u201c \u2018[D]is-\ncriminations of an unusual character especially sug-\ngest careful consideration to determine whether they are\nobnoxious to the constitutional provision.\u2019 \u201d Romer v.\nEvans, 517 U. S. 620, 633 (1996) (quoting Louisville Gas &\nElec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37\u201338 (1928)).\n   The Federal Government uses this state-defined class\nfor the opposite purpose\u2014to impose restrictions and dis-\nabilities. That result requires this Court now to address\nwhether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation\nof an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth\nAmendment. What the State of New York treats as alike\nthe federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure\nthe same class the State seeks to protect.\n   In acting first to recognize and then to allow same-sex\nmarriages, New York was responding \u201cto the initiative of\nthose who [sought] a voice in shaping the destiny of their\nown times.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 9). These actions were without doubt a\nproper exercise of its sovereign authority within our fed-\neral system, all in the way that the Framers of the Constitu-\ntion intended. The dynamics of state government in the\nfederal system are to allow the formation of consensus\nrespecting the way the members of a discrete community\ntreat each other in their daily contact and constant inter-\naction with each other.\n   The States\u2019 interest in defining and regulating the\nmarital relation, subject to constitutional guarantees,\nstems from the understanding that marriage is more than\na routine classification for purposes of certain statutory\nbenefits. Private, consensual sexual intimacy between two\nadult persons of the same sex may not be punished by the\nState, and it can form \u201cbut one element in a personal bond\nthat is more enduring.\u201d Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558,\n567 (2003). By its recognition of the validity of same-sex\n20              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmarriages performed in other jurisdictions and then by\nauthorizing same-sex unions and same-sex marriages,\nNew York sought to give further protection and dignity to\nthat bond. For same-sex couples who wished to be mar-\nried, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful\nstatus. This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledg-\nment of the intimate relationship between two people, a\nrelationship deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the\ncommunity equal with all other marriages. It reflects both\nthe community\u2019s considered perspective on the historical\nroots of the institution of marriage and its evolving under-\nstanding of the meaning of equality.\n                             IV\n   DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to\nprotect. By doing so it violates basic due process and\nequal protection principles applicable to the Federal Gov-\nernment. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; Bolling v. Sharpe,\n347 U. S. 497 (1954). The Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nequality \u201cmust at the very least mean that a bare con-\ngressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group\ncannot\u201d justify disparate treatment of that group. Depart\u00ad\nment of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534\u2013535\n(1973). In determining whether a law is motived by an\nimproper animus or purpose, \u201c \u2018[d]iscriminations of an un-\nusual character\u2019 \u201d especially require careful considera-\ntion. Supra, at 19 (quoting Romer, supra, at 633). DOMA\ncannot survive under these principles. The responsibility\nof the States for the regulation of domestic relations is an\nimportant indicator of the substantial societal impact the\nState\u2019s classifications have in the daily lives and customs\nof its people. DOMA\u2019s unusual deviation from the usual\ntradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of\nmarriage here operates to deprive same-sex couples of the\nbenefits and responsibilities that come with the federal\nrecognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law\nhere in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate\nstatus, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex\nmarriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of\nthe States.\n  The history of DOMA\u2019s enactment and its own text\ndemonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of\nsame-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in\nthe exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an\nincidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence.\nThe House Report announced its conclusion that \u201cit is both\nappropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can\nto defend the institution of traditional heterosexual mar-\nriage. . . . H. R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the \u2018Defense\nof Marriage Act.\u2019 The effort to redefine \u2018marriage\u2019 to ex-\ntend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that\nwould fundamentally alter the institution of marriage.\u201d\nH. R. Rep. No. 104\u2013664, pp. 12\u201313 (1996). The House\nconcluded that DOMA expresses \u201cboth moral disapproval\nof homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexu-\nality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-\nChristian) morality.\u201d Id., at 16 (footnote deleted). The\nstated purpose of the law was to promote an \u201cinterest in\nprotecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in\nheterosexual-only marriage laws.\u201d Ibid. Were there any\ndoubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act\nconfirms it: The Defense of Marriage.\n  The arguments put forward by BLAG are just as candid\nabout the congressional purpose to influence or interfere\nwith state sovereign choices about who may be married.\nAs the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its purpose is\nto discourage enactment of state same-sex marriage laws\nand to restrict the freedom and choice of couples married\nunder those laws if they are enacted. The congressional\ngoal was \u201cto put a thumb on the scales and influence a\n22              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate\u2019s decision as to how to shape its own marriage laws.\u201d\nMassachusetts, 682 F. 3d, at 12\u201313. The Act\u2019s demon-\nstrated purpose is to ensure that if any State decides to\nrecognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated\nas second-class marriages for purposes of federal law.\nThis raises a most serious question under the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s Fifth Amendment.\n   DOMA\u2019s operation in practice confirms this purpose.\nWhen New York adopted a law to permit same-sex mar-\nriage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frus-\ntrates that objective through a system-wide enactment\nwith no identified connection to any particular area of fed-\neral law. DOMA writes inequality into the entire United\nStates Code. The particular case at hand concerns the\nestate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple determi-\nnation of what should or should not be allowed as an\nestate tax refund. Among the over 1,000 statutes and\nnumerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are\nlaws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, crimi-\nnal sanctions, copyright, and veterans\u2019 benefits.\n   DOMA\u2019s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-\nsanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The prin-\ncipal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons\nlike governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as\nrights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.\nAnd DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married\nunder the laws of their State, but not other couples, of\nboth rights and responsibilities. By creating two contra-\ndictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA\nforces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose\nof state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal\nlaw, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of\nbasic personal relations the State has found it proper to\nacknowledge and protect. By this dynamic DOMA under-\nmines both the public and private significance of state-\nsanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages\nare unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex\ncouples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier\nmarriage. The differentiation demeans the couple, whose\nmoral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see\nLawrence, 539 U. S. 558, and whose relationship the State\nhas sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands\nof children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law\nin question makes it even more difficult for the children to\nunderstand the integrity and closeness of their own family\nand its concord with other families in their community\nand in their daily lives.\n   Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their\nlives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible\nand public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many\naspects of married and family life, from the mundane to\nthe profound. It prevents same-sex married couples\nfrom obtaining government healthcare benefits they would\notherwise receive. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a78901(5), 8905. It\ndeprives them of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s special protec-\ntions for domestic-support obligations. See 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7101(14A), 507(a)(1)(A), 523(a)(5), 523(a)(15). It forces\nthem to follow a complicated procedure to file their state\nand federal taxes jointly. Technical Bulletin TB\u201355, 2010\nVt.

National Ceme-\ntery Administration Directive 3210/1, p. 37 (June 4, 2008).\n   For certain married couples, DOMA\u2019s unequal effects\nare even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a\ncrime to \u201cassaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] . . . a member of\nthe immediate family\u201d of \u201ca United States official, a\nUnited States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement officer,\u201d\n18 U.

WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily,\u201d \u00a7115(c)(2), DOMA makes this protection inappli-\ncable to same-sex spouses.\n   DOMA also brings financial harm to children of same-\nsex couples. It raises the cost of health care for families\nby taxing health benefits provided by employers to their\nworkers\u2019 same-sex spouses. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7106; Treas.\nReg. \u00a71.106\u20131, 26 CFR \u00a71.106\u20131 (2012); IRS Private Letter\nRuling 9850011 (Sept. 10, 1998). And it denies or re-\nduces benefits allowed to families upon the loss of a spouse\nand parent, benefits that are an integral part of family\nsecurity. See Social Security Administration, Social Secu-\nrity Survivors Benefits 5 (2012) (benefits available to a\nsurviving spouse caring for the couple\u2019s child), online at\nhttp://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10084.pdf.\n   DOMA divests married same-sex couples of the duties\nand responsibilities that are an essential part of married\nlife and that they in most cases would be honored to accept\nwere DOMA not in force. For instance, because it is ex-\npected that spouses will support each other as they pursue\neducational opportunities, federal law takes into consider-\nation a spouse\u2019s income in calculating a student\u2019s fed-\neral financial aid eligibility. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a71087nn(b).\nSame-sex married couples are exempt from this require-\nment. The same is true with respect to federal ethics\nrules. Federal executive and agency officials are prohibit-\ned from \u201cparticipat[ing] personally and substantially\u201d in\nmatters as to which they or their spouses have a financial\ninterest. 18 U.

This requires\nthe Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconsti-\ntutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person pro-\ntected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\n   The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due\nProcess Clause contains within it the prohibition against\ndenying to any person the equal protection of the laws.\nSee Bolling, 347 U.

While the\nFifth Amendment itself withdraws from Government the\npower to degrade or demean in the way this law does,\nthe equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment makes that Fifth Amendment right all the more\nspecific and all the better understood and preserved.\n   The class to which DOMA directs its restrictions and\nrestraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex\nmarriages made lawful by the State. DOMA singles out a\nclass of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition\nand protection to enhance their own liberty. It imposes a\ndisability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status\nthe State finds to be dignified and proper. DOMA in-\nstructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with\nwhom same-sex couples interact, including their own\nchildren, that their marriage is less worthy than the mar-\nriages of others.

On\nthe merits of the constitutional dispute the Court decides to\ndecide, I also agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that Congress\nacted constitutionally in passing the Defense of Marriage\nAct (DOMA).

Post,\nat 19\u201320 (dissenting opinion).\n   The majority sees a more sinister motive, pointing out\nthat the Federal Government has generally (though not\nuniformly) deferred to state definitions of marriage in the\npast. That is true, of course, but none of those prior state-\nby-state variations had involved differences over some-\nthing\u2014as the majority puts it\u2014\u201cthought of by most people\nas essential to the very definition of [marriage] and to\nits role and function throughout the history of civilization.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. That the Federal Government treated this\nfundamental question differently than it treated variations\nover consanguinity or minimum age is hardly surprising\u2014\nand hardly enough to support a conclusion that the\n\u201cprincipal purpose,\u201d ante, at 22, of the 342 Representa-\n2                UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntives and 85 Senators who voted for it, and the President\nwho signed it, was a bare desire to harm. Nor do the snip-\npets of legislative history and the banal title of the Act\nto which the majority points suffice to make such a show-\ning. At least without some more convincing evidence that\nthe Act\u2019s principal purpose was to codify malice, and that\nit furthered no legitimate government interests, I would\nnot tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry.\n   But while I disagree with the result to which the major-\nity\u2019s analysis leads it in this case, I think it more important\nto point out that its analysis leads no further. The Court\ndoes not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does\nnot decide, the distinct question whether the States, in the\nexercise of their \u201chistoric and essential authority to define\nthe marital relation,\u201d ante, at 18, may continue to utilize\nthe traditional definition of marriage.\n   The majority goes out of its way to make this explicit in\nthe penultimate sentence of its opinion. It states that\n\u201c[t]his opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful\nmarriages,\u201d ante, at 26\u2014referring to same-sex marriages\nthat a State has already recognized as a result of the local\n\u201ccommunity\u2019s considered perspective on the historical\nroots of the institution of marriage and its evolving un-\nderstanding of the meaning of equality.\u201d Ante, at 20.\nJUSTICE SCALIA believes this is a \u201c \u2018bald, unreasoned dis-\nclaime[r].\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22. In my view, though, the disclaimer\nis a logical and necessary consequence of the argument\nthe majority has chosen to adopt. The dominant theme\nof the majority opinion is that the Federal Government\u2019s\nintrusion into an area \u201ccentral to state domestic relations\nlaw applicable to its residents and citizens\u201d is sufficiently\n\u201cunusual\u201d to set off alarm bells.

I think\nthe majority goes off course, as I have said, but it is unde-\nniable that its judgment is based on federalism.\n   The majority extensively chronicles DOMA\u2019s departure\nfrom the normal allocation of responsibility between State\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

But there is\nno such departure when one State adopts or keeps a defi-\nnition of marriage that differs from that of its neighbor,\nfor it is entirely expected that state definitions would\n\u201cvary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State\nto the next.\u201d Ibid. Thus, while \u201c[t]he State\u2019s power in\ndefining the marital relation is of central relevance\u201d to the\nmajority\u2019s decision to strike down DOMA here, ibid., that\npower will come into play on the other side of the board in\nfuture cases about the constitutionality of state marriage\ndefinitions. So too will the concerns for state diversity and\nsovereignty that weigh against DOMA\u2019s constitutionality\nin this case. See ante, at 19.\n   It is not just this central feature of the majority\u2019s analy-\nsis that is unique to DOMA, but many considerations on\nthe periphery as well. For example, the majority focuses\non the legislative history and title of this particular Act,\nante, at 21; those statute-specific considerations will, of\ncourse, be irrelevant in future cases about different stat-\nutes. The majority emphasizes that DOMA was a \u201csystem-\nwide enactment with no identified connection to any\nparticular area of federal law,\u201d but a State\u2019s definition of\nmarriage \u201cis the foundation of the State\u2019s broader author-\nity to regulate the subject of domestic relations with re-\nspect to the \u2018[p]rotection of offspring, property interests,\nand the enforcement of marital responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n22, 17.

The Court\u2019s errors on both points spring forth\nfrom the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the\nrole of this institution in America.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Court is eager\u2014hungry\u2014to tell everyone its view of\nthe legal question at the heart of this case. Standing in\nthe way is an obstacle, a technicality of little interest to\nanyone but the people of We the People, who created it as\na barrier against judges\u2019 intrusion into their lives. They\ngave judges, in Article III, only the \u201cjudicial Power,\u201d a\npower to decide not abstract questions but real, concrete\n2                UNITED STATES v.

They agree that the court below got it right; and\nthey agreed in the court below that the court below that\none got it right as well. What, then, are we doing here?\n   The answer lies at the heart of the jurisdictional portion\nof today\u2019s opinion, where a single sentence lays bare the\nmajority\u2019s vision of our role. The Court says that we have\nthe power to decide this case because if we did not, then\nour \u201cprimary role in determining the constitutionality of\na law\u201d (at least one that \u201chas inflicted real injury on a\nplaintiff \u201d) would \u201cbecome only secondary to the President\u2019s.\u201d\nAnte, at 12. But wait, the reader wonders\u2014Windsor won\nbelow, and so cured her injury, and the President was glad\nto see it. True, says the majority, but judicial review must\nmarch on regardless, lest we \u201cundermine the clear dictate\nof the separation-of-powers principle that when an Act of\nCongress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, it is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted).\n   That is jaw-dropping. It is an assertion of judicial su-\npremacy over the people\u2019s Representatives in Congress\nand the Executive. It envisions a Supreme Court standing\n(or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empow-\nered to decide all constitutional questions, always and every-\nwhere \u201cprimary\u201d in its role.\n   This image of the Court would have been unrecognizable\nto those who wrote and ratified our national charter. They\nknew well the dangers of \u201cprimary\u201d power, and so created\nbranches of government that would be \u201cperfectly co-\nordinate by the terms of their common commission,\u201d none\nof which branches could \u201cpretend to an exclusive or supe-\nrior right of settling the boundaries between their respec-\ntive powers.\u201d The Federalist, No. 49, p. 314 (C. Rossiter\ned. 1961) (J. Madison). The people did this to protect\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nthemselves. They did it to guard their right to self-rule\nagainst the black-robed supremacy that today\u2019s majority\nfinds so attractive. So it was that Madison could confi-\ndently state, with no fear of contradiction, that there was\nnothing of \u201cgreater intrinsic value\u201d or \u201cstamped with the\nauthority of more enlightened patrons of liberty\u201d than a\ngovernment of separate and coordinate powers. Id., No.\n47, at 301.\n   For this reason we are quite forbidden to say what the\nlaw is whenever (as today\u2019s opinion asserts) \u201c \u2018an Act of\nCongress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 12. We can do so only when that allegation will\ndetermine the outcome of a lawsuit, and is contradicted by\nthe other party. The \u201cjudicial Power\u201d is not, as the major-\nity believes, the power \u201c \u2018to say what the law is,\u2019 \u201d ibid.,\ngiving the Supreme Court the \u201cprimary role in determin-\ning the constitutionality of laws.\u201d The majority must have\nin mind one of the foreign constitutions that pronounces\nsuch primacy for its constitutional court and allows that\nprimacy to be exercised in contexts other than a lawsuit.\nSee, e.g., Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany,\nArt. 93. The judicial power as Americans have understood\nit (and their English ancestors before them) is the power\nto adjudicate, with conclusive effect, disputed govern-\nment claims (civil or criminal) against private persons, and\ndisputed claims by private persons against the govern-\nment or other private persons. Sometimes (though not\nalways) the parties before the court disagree not with\nregard to the facts of their case (or not only with regard to\nthe facts) but with regard to the applicable law\u2014in which\nevent (and only in which event) it becomes the \u201c \u2018province\nand duty of the judicial department to say what the law\nis.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12.\n   In other words, declaring the compatibility of state or\nfederal laws with the Constitution is not only not the\n\u201cprimary role\u201d of this Court, it is not a separate, free-\n4                UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nstanding role at all. We perform that role incidentally\u2014by\naccident, as it were\u2014when that is necessary to resolve the\ndispute before us. Then, and only then, does it become\n\u201c \u2018the province and duty of the judicial department to say\nwhat the law is.\u2019 \u201d That is why, in 1793, we politely de-\nclined the Washington Administration\u2019s request to \u201csay\nwhat the law is\u201d on a particular treaty matter that was\nnot the subject of a concrete legal controversy. 3 Corre-\nspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486\u2013489 (H.\nJohnston ed. 1893). And that is why, as our opinions have\nsaid, some questions of law will never be presented to this\nCourt, because there will never be anyone with standing\nto bring a lawsuit. See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to\nStop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227 (1974); United States v.\nRichardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179 (1974). As Justice Bran-\ndeis put it, we cannot \u201cpass upon the constitutionality of\nlegislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding\u201d; ab-\nsent a \u201c \u2018real, earnest and vital controversy between indi-\nviduals,\u2019 \u201d we have neither any work to do nor any power to\ndo it. Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346 (1936) (con-\ncurring opinion) (quoting Chicago & Grand Trunk R. Co.\nv. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339, 345 (1892)). Our authority\nbegins and ends with the need to adjudge the rights of an\ninjured party who stands before us seeking redress. Lujan\nv. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992).\n    That is completely absent here. Windsor\u2019s injury was\ncured by the judgment in her favor. And while, in ordi-\nnary circumstances, the United States is injured by a\ndirective to pay a tax refund, this suit is far from ordinary.\nWhatever injury the United States has suffered will surely\nnot be redressed by the action that it, as a litigant, asks us\nto take. The final sentence of the Solicitor General\u2019s brief\non the merits reads: \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the judg-\nment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States (merits) 54 (emphasis added). That will not\ncure the Government\u2019s injury, but carve it into stone. One\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

And the same was true in the Court of\nAppeals: Neither party sought to undo the judgment for\nWindsor, and so that court should have dismissed the\nappeal (just as we should dismiss) for lack of jurisdiction.\nSince both parties agreed with the judgment of the Dis-\ntrict Court for the Southern District of New York, the suit\nshould have ended there. The further proceedings have\nbeen a contrivance, having no object in mind except to ele-\nvate a District Court judgment that has no precedential\neffect in other courts, to one that has precedential effect\nthroughout the Second Circuit, and then (in this Court)\nprecedential effect throughout the United States.\n   We have never before agreed to speak\u2014to \u201csay what the\nlaw is\u201d\u2014where there is no controversy before us. In the\nmore than two centuries that this Court has existed as an\ninstitution, we have never suggested that we have the\npower to decide a question when every party agrees with\nboth its nominal opponent and the court below on that\nquestion\u2019s answer. The United States reluctantly con-\nceded that at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\u201320.\n   The closest we have ever come to what the Court blesses\ntoday was our opinion in INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919\n(1983). But in that case, two parties to the litigation\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For an even more advanced scavenger hunt, one might search the\n\nannals of Anglo-American law for another \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d like the\none the United States filed in District Court: It argued that the court\nshould agree \u201cwith Plaintiff and the United States\u201d and \u201cnot dismiss\u201d\nthe complaint. (Emphasis mine.) Then, having gotten exactly what it\nasked for, the United States promptly appealed.\n6                   UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n disagreed with the position of the United States and with\nthe court below: the House and Senate, which had inter-\nvened in the case. Because Chadha concerned the validity\nof a mode of congressional action\u2014the one-house legis-\nlative veto\u2014the House and Senate were threatened with\ndestruction of what they claimed to be one of their institu-\ntional powers. The Executive choosing not to defend that\npower,2 we permitted the House and Senate to intervene.\nNothing like that is present here.\n   To be sure, the Court in Chadha said that statutory\naggrieved-party status was \u201cnot altered by the fact that\nthe Executive may agree with the holding that the statute\nin question is unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 930\u2013931. But in\na footnote to that statement, the Court acknowledged Arti-\ncle III\u2019s separate requirement of a \u201cjusticiable case or\ncontroversy,\u201d and stated that this requirement was satis-\nfied \u201cbecause of the presence of the two Houses of Con-\ngress as adverse parties.\u201d Id., at 931, n. 6. Later in its\nopinion, the Chadha Court remarked that the United\nStates\u2019 announced intention to enforce the statute also\nsufficed to permit judicial review, even absent congres-\nsional participation. Id., at 939. That remark is true, as a\ndescription of the judicial review conducted in the Court of\nAppeals, where the Houses of Congress had not inter-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 There the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to defend the legislation\n\nwas in accord with its longstanding (and entirely reasonable) practice of\ndeclining to defend legislation that in its view infringes upon Presiden-\ntial powers. There is no justification for the Justice Department\u2019s\nabandoning the law in the present case. The majority opinion makes a\npoint of scolding the President for his \u201cfailure to defend the constitu-\ntionality of an Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet\nestablished in judicial decisions,\u201d ante, at 12. But the rebuke is tongue-\nin-cheek, for the majority gladly gives the President what he wants.\nContrary to all precedent, it decides this case (and even decides it the\nway the President wishes) despite his abandonment of the defense and\nthe consequent absence of a case or controversy.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nvened. (The case originated in the Court of Appeals, since\nit sought review of agency action under 8 U. S. C. \u00a71105a(a)\n(1976 ed.).) There, absent a judgment setting aside\nthe INS order, Chadha faced deportation. This pas-\nsage of our opinion seems to be addressing that initial\nstanding in the Court of Appeals, as indicated by its quo-\ntation from the lower court\u2019s opinion, 462 U. S., at 939\u2013\n940. But if it was addressing standing to pursue the\nappeal, the remark was both the purest dictum (as con-\ngressional intervention at that point made the required\nadverseness \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d id., at 939), and quite incor-\nrect. When a private party has a judicial decree safely in\nhand to prevent his injury, additional judicial action re-\nquires that a party injured by the decree seek to undo it.\nIn Chadha, the intervening House and Senate fulfilled\nthat requirement. Here no one does.\n   The majority\u2019s discussion of the requirements of Article\nIII bears no resemblance to our jurisprudence. It accuses\nthe amicus (appointed to argue against our jurisdiction) of\n\u201celid[ing] the distinction between . . . the jurisdictional\nrequirements of Article III and the prudential limits on its\nexercise.\u201d Ante, at 6. It then proceeds to call the require-\nment of adverseness a \u201cprudential\u201d aspect of standing. Of\nstanding. That is incomprehensible. A plaintiff (or appel-\nlant) can have all the standing in the world\u2014satisfying all\nthree standing requirements of Lujan that the majority so\ncarefully quotes, ante, at 7\u2014and yet no Article III contro-\nversy may be before the court. Article III requires not just\na plaintiff (or appellant) who has standing to complain\nbut an opposing party who denies the validity of the com-\nplaint. It is not the amicus that has done the eliding of\ndistinctions, but the majority, calling the quite separate\nArticle III requirement of adverseness between the parties\nan element (which it then pronounces a \u201cprudential\u201d ele-\nment) of standing. The question here is not whether, as\nthe majority puts it, \u201cthe United States retains a stake\n8               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to support Article III jurisdiction,\u201d ibid. the\nquestion is whether there is any controversy (which re-\nquires contradiction) between the United States and Ms.\nWindsor. There is not.\n   I find it wryly amusing that the majority seeks to dis-\nmiss the requirement of party-adverseness as nothing\nmore than a \u201cprudential\u201d aspect of the sole Article III\nrequirement of standing. (Relegating a jurisdictional re-\nquirement to \u201cprudential\u201d status is a wondrous device,\nenabling courts to ignore the requirement whenever they\nbelieve it \u201cprudent\u201d\u2014which is to say, a good idea.) Half a\ncentury ago, a Court similarly bent upon announcing its\nview regarding the constitutionality of a federal statute\nachieved that goal by effecting a remarkably similar but\ncompletely opposite distortion of the principles limiting our\njurisdiction. The Court\u2019s notorious opinion in Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83, 98\u2013101 (1968), held that standing\nwas merely an element (which it pronounced to be a\n\u201cprudential\u201d element) of the sole Article III requirement\nof adverseness. We have been living with the chaos created\nby that power-grabbing decision ever since, see Hein v.\nFreedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587\n(2007), as we will have to live with the chaos created by\nthis one.\n   The authorities the majority cites fall miles short of\nsupporting the counterintuitive notion that an Article III\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d can exist without disagreement between the\nparties. In Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445\nU. S. 326 (1980), the District Court had entered judgment\nin the individual plaintiff \u2019s favor based on the defendant\nbank\u2019s offer to pay the full amount claimed. The plaintiff,\nhowever, sought to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of\nclass certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23. There was a continuing dispute between the parties\nconcerning the issue raised on appeal. The same is true of\nthe other case cited by the majority, Camreta v. Greene,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). There the District Court found that\nthe defendant state officers had violated the Fourth\nAmendment, but rendered judgment in their favor because\nthey were entitled to official immunity, application of the\nFourth Amendment to their conduct not having been clear\nat the time of violation. The officers sought to appeal\nthe holding of Fourth Amendment violation, which would\ncircumscribe their future conduct; the plaintiff continued\nto insist that a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred.\nThe \u201cprudential\u201d discretion to which both those cases refer\nwas the discretion to deny an appeal even when a live\ncontroversy exists\u2014not the discretion to grant one when it\ndoes not. The majority can cite no case in which this\nCourt entertained an appeal in which both parties urged\nus to affirm the judgment below. And that is because the\nexistence of a controversy is not a \u201cprudential\u201d require-\nment that we have invented, but an essential element of\nan Article III case or controversy. The majority\u2019s notion\nthat a case between friendly parties can be entertained so\nlong as \u201cadversarial presentation of the issues is assured\nby the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend\nwith vigor\u201d the other side of the issue, ante, at 10, effects a\nbreathtaking revolution in our Article III jurisprudence.\n   It may be argued that if what we say is true some Presi-\ndential determinations that statutes are unconstitutional\nwill not be subject to our review. That is as it should\nbe, when both the President and the plaintiff agree that\nthe statute is unconstitutional. Where the Executive is en-\nforcing an unconstitutional law, suit will of course lie; but\nif, in that suit, the Executive admits the unconstitution-\nality of the law, the litigation should end in an order or a\nconsent decree enjoining enforcement. This suit saw the\nlight of day only because the President enforced the Act\n(and thus gave Windsor standing to sue) even though he\nbelieved it unconstitutional. He could have equally chosen\n(more appropriately, some would say) neither to enforce\n10              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnor to defend the statute he believed to be unconstitu-\ntional, see Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute Un-\nconstitutional Statutes, 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 199\n(Nov. 2, 1994)\u2014in which event Windsor would not have\nbeen injured, the District Court could not have refereed\nthis friendly scrimmage, and the Executive\u2019s determina-\ntion of unconstitutionality would have escaped this Court\u2019s\ndesire to blurt out its view of the law. The matter would\nhave been left, as so many matters ought to be left, to a\ntug of war between the President and the Congress, which\nhas innumerable means (up to and including impeach-\nment) of compelling the President to enforce the laws it\nhas written. Or the President could have evaded presen-\ntation of the constitutional issue to this Court simply by\ndeclining to appeal the District Court and Court of Ap-\npeals dispositions he agreed with. Be sure of this much: If\na President wants to insulate his judgment of unconstitu-\ntionality from our review, he can. What the views urged\nin this dissent produce is not insulation from judicial\nreview but insulation from Executive contrivance.\n   The majority brandishes the famous sentence from\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) that \u201c[i]t is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d Ante, at 12 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But that sentence neither says nor\nimplies that it is always the province and duty of the\nCourt to say what the law is\u2014much less that its responsi-\nbility in that regard is a \u201cprimary\u201d one. The very next\nsentence of Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion makes the\ncrucial qualification that today\u2019s majority ignores: \u201cThose\nwho apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity\nexpound and interpret that rule.\u201d 1 Cranch, at 177 (em-\nphasis added). Only when a \u201cparticular case\u201d is before\nus\u2014that is, a controversy that it is our business to resolve\nunder Article III\u2014do we have the province and duty to\npronounce the law.

Mansfield\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE ALITO attempts to limit his argument by claiming that Con-\ngress is injured (and can therefore appeal) when its statute is held\nunconstitutional without Presidential defense, but is not injured when\nits statute is held unconstitutional despite Presidential defense. I do\nnot understand that line. The injury to Congress is the same whether\nthe President has defended the statute or not. And if the injury is\nthreatened, why should Congress not be able to participate in the suit\nfrom the beginning, just as the President can? And if having a statute\ndeclared unconstitutional (and therefore inoperative) by a court is an\ninjury, why is it not an injury when a statute is declared unconstitu-\ntional by the President and rendered inoperative by his consequent\nfailure to enforce it? Or when the President simply declines to enforce\nit without opining on its constitutionality? If it is the inoperativeness\nthat constitutes the injury\u2014the \u201cimpairment of [the legislative] func-\ntion,\u201d as JUSTICE ALITO puts it, post, at 4\u2014it should make no difference\nwhich of the other two branches inflicts it, and whether the Constitu-\ntion is the pretext. A principled and predictable system of jurispru-\ndence cannot rest upon a shifting concept of injury, designed to support\nstanding when we would like it.

S. 811 (1997),\nwhich involved an original suit by Members of Congress challenging an\nassertedly unconstitutional law, would have been written quite differ-\nently; and JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s distinguishing of that case on grounds quite\nirrelevant to his theory of standing would have been unnecessary.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n& D. Winthrop eds. 2000). That would be replaced by a\nsystem in which Congress and the Executive can pop\nimmediately into court, in their institutional capacity,\nwhenever the President refuses to implement a statute he\nbelieves to be unconstitutional, and whenever he imple-\nments a law in a manner that is not to Congress\u2019s liking.\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s notion of standing will likewise enor-\nmously shrink the area to which \u201cjudicial censure, exer-\ncised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend,\u201d ibid.\nFor example, a bare majority of both Houses could bring\ninto court the assertion that the Executive\u2019s implementa-\ntion of welfare programs is too generous\u2014a failure that no\nother litigant would have standing to complain about.\nMoreover, as we indicated in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S.\n811, 828 (1997), if Congress can sue the Executive for the\nerroneous application of the law that \u201cinjures\u201d its power to\nlegislate, surely the Executive can sue Congress for its\nerroneous adoption of an unconstitutional law that \u201cin-\njures\u201d the Executive\u2019s power to administer\u2014or perhaps for\nits protracted failure to act on one of his nominations. The\nopportunities for dragging the courts into disputes hith-\nerto left for political resolution are endless.\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s dissent is correct that Raines did not\nformally decide this issue, but its reasoning does. The\nopinion spends three pages discussing famous, decades-\nlong disputes between the President and Congress\u2014\nregarding congressional power to forbid the Presidential\nremoval of executive officers, regarding the legislative\nveto, regarding congressional appointment of executive\nofficers, and regarding the pocket veto\u2014that would\nsurely have been promptly resolved by a Congress-vs.-the-\nPresident lawsuit if the impairment of a branch\u2019s powers\nalone conferred standing to commence litigation. But it\ndoes not, and never has; the \u201cenormous power that the\njudiciary would acquire\u201d from the ability to adjudicate\nsuch suits \u201cwould have made a mockery of [Hamilton\u2019s]\n14              UNITED STATES v.

Kline, 759 F. 2d 21, 58 (CADC 1985)\n(Bork, J., dissenting) (quoting The Federalist No. 78 (A.\nHamilton)).\n  To be sure, if Congress cannot invoke our authority in\nthe way that JUSTICE ALITO proposes, then its only re-\ncourse is to confront the President directly. Unimaginable\nevil this is not. Our system is designed for confrontation.\nThat is what \u201c[a]mbition . . . counteract[ing] ambition,\u201d\nThe Federalist, No. 51, at 322 (J. Madison), is all about. If\nmajorities in both Houses of Congress care enough about\nthe matter, they have available innumerable ways to com-\npel executive action without a lawsuit\u2014from refusing\nto confirm Presidential appointees to the elimination of\nfunding. (Nothing says \u201cenforce the Act\u201d quite like \u201c. . . or\nyou will have money for little else.\u201d) But the condition is\ncrucial; Congress must care enough to act against the\nPresident itself, not merely enough to instruct its lawyers\nto ask us to do so. Placing the Constitution\u2019s entirely\nanticipated political arm wrestling into permanent judicial\nreceivership does not do the system a favor. And by the\nway, if the President loses the lawsuit but does not faith-\nfully implement the Court\u2019s decree, just as he did not\nfaithfully implement Congress\u2019s statute, what then? Only\nCongress can bring him to heel by . . . what do you think?\nYes: a direct confrontation with the President.\n                             II\n  For the reasons above, I think that this Court has, and\nthe Court of Appeals had, no power to decide this suit. We\nshould vacate the decision below and remand to the Court\nof Appeals for the Second Circuit, with instructions to\ndismiss the appeal. Given that the majority has volun-\nteered its view of the merits, however, I proceed to discuss\nthat as well.\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

The first is how rootless and shifting its\njustifications are. For example, the opinion starts with\nseven full pages about the traditional power of States to\ndefine domestic relations\u2014initially fooling many readers,\nI am sure, into thinking that this is a federalism opinion.\nBut we are eventually told that \u201cit is unnecessary to de-\ncide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a vio-\nlation of the Constitution,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s power\nin defining the marital relation is of central relevance\nin this case quite apart from principles of federalism\u201d be-\ncause \u201cthe State\u2019s decision to give this class of persons\nthe right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and\nstatus of immense import.\u201d Ante, at 18. But no one ques-\ntions the power of the States to define marriage (with the\nconcomitant conferral of dignity and status), so what is the\npoint of devoting seven pages to describing how long and\nwell established that power is? Even after the opinion has\nformally disclaimed reliance upon principles of federalism,\nmentions of \u201cthe usual tradition of recognizing and accept-\ning state definitions of marriage\u201d continue. See, e.g., ante,\nat 20. What to make of this? The opinion never explains.\nMy guess is that the majority, while reluctant to suggest\nthat defining the meaning of \u201cmarriage\u201d in federal stat-\nutes is unsupported by any of the Federal Government\u2019s\nenumerated powers,4 nonetheless needs some rhetorical\nbasis to support its pretense that today\u2019s prohibition of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Such a suggestion would be impossible, given the Federal Govern-\n\nment\u2019s long history of making pronouncements regarding marriage\u2014for\nexample, conditioning Utah\u2019s entry into the Union upon its prohibition\nof polygamy. See Act of July 16, 1894, ch. 138, \u00a73, 28 Stat. 108 (\u201cThe\nconstitution [of Utah]\u201d must provide \u201cperfect toleration of religious\nsentiment,\u201d \u201cProvided, That polygamous or plural marriages are\nforever prohibited\u201d).\n16                 UNITED STATES v.

But I am only guessing.\n   Equally perplexing are the opinion\u2019s references to \u201cthe\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of equality.\u201d Ibid. Near the end\nof the opinion, we are told that although the \u201cequal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment makes [the]\nFifth Amendment [due process] right all the more specific\nand all the better understood and preserved\u201d\u2014what can\nthat mean?\u2014\u201cthe Fifth Amendment itself withdraws from\nGovernment the power to degrade or demean in the way\nthis law does.\u201d Ante, at 25. The only possible interpreta-\ntion of this statement is that the Equal Protection Clause,\neven the Equal Protection Clause as incorporated in the\nDue Process Clause, is not the basis for today\u2019s holding.\nBut the portion of the majority opinion that explains why\nDOMA is unconstitutional (Part IV) begins by citing Bol-\nling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), Department of Agri-\nculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528 (1973), and Romer v.\nEvans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996)\u2014all of which are equal-\nprotection cases.5 And those three cases are the only\nauthorities that the Court cites in Part IV about the Con-\nstitution\u2019s meaning, except for its citation of Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (not an equal-protection case)\nto support its passing assertion that the Constitution\nprotects the \u201cmoral and sexual choices\u201d of same-sex cou-\nples, ante, at 23.\n   Moreover, if this is meant to be an equal-protection\nopinion, it is a confusing one. The opinion does not resolve\nand indeed does not even mention what had been the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Since the Equal Protection Clause technically applies only against\n\nthe States, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, Bolling and Moreno, dealing\nwith federal action, relied upon \u201cthe equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Moreno, 413 U. S., at\n533.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

That is the issue that divided the parties and\nthe court below, compare Brief for Respondent Bipartisan\nLegal Advisory Group of U. S. House of Representatives\n(merits) 24\u201328 (no), with Brief for Respondent Windsor\n(merits) 17\u201331 and Brief for United States (merits) 18\u201336\n(yes); and compare 699 F. 3d 169, 180\u2013185 (CA2 2012)\n(yes), with id., at 208\u2013211 (Straub, J., dissenting in part\nand concurring in part) (no). In accord with my previously\nexpressed skepticism about the Court\u2019s \u201ctiers of scrutiny\u201d\napproach, I would review this classification only for its\nrationality. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515,\n567\u2013570 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). As nearly as I can\ntell, the Court agrees with that; its opinion does not apply\nstrict scrutiny, and its central propositions are taken from\nrational-basis cases like Moreno. But the Court certainly\ndoes not apply anything that resembles that deferential\nframework. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993)\n(a classification \u201c\u2018must be upheld . . . if there is any reason-\nably conceivable state of facts\u2019 \u201d that could justify it).\n   The majority opinion need not get into the strict-vs.-\nrational-basis scrutiny question, and need not justify its\nholding under either, because it says that DOMA is un-\nconstitutional as \u201ca deprivation of the liberty of the person\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution,\u201d\nante, at 25; that it violates \u201cbasic due process\u201d principles,\nante, at 20; and that it inflicts an \u201cinjury and indignity\u201d of\na kind that denies \u201can essential part of the liberty pro-\ntected by the Fifth Amendment,\u201d ante, at 19. The majority\nnever utters the dread words \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d\nperhaps sensing the disrepute into which that doctrine\nhas fallen, but that is what those statements mean. Yet\nthe opinion does not argue that same-sex marriage is\n\u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d\n18               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720\u2013721\n(1997), a claim that would of course be quite absurd. So\nwould the further suggestion (also necessary, under our\nsubstantive-due-process precedents) that a world in which\nDOMA exists is one bereft of \u201c \u2018ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 721\n(quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937)).\n  Some might conclude that this loaf could have used a\nwhile longer in the oven. But that would be wrong; it is\nalready overcooked. The most expert care in preparation\ncannot redeem a bad recipe. The sum of all the Court\u2019s\nnonspecific hand-waving is that this law is invalid (maybe\non equal-protection grounds, maybe on substantive-due-\nprocess grounds, and perhaps with some amorphous fed-\neralism component playing a role) because it is motivated\nby a \u201c \u2018bare . . . desire to harm\u2019 \u201d couples in same-sex mar-\nriages. Ante, at 20. It is this proposition with which I will\ntherefore engage.\n                             B\n  As I have observed before, the Constitution does not\nforbid the government to enforce traditional moral and\nsexual norms. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 599\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I will not swell the U. S.\nReports with restatements of that point. It is enough to\nsay that the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our\nsociety to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it nei-\nther requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce,\npolygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.\n  However, even setting aside traditional moral disap-\nproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex),\nthere are many perfectly valid\u2014indeed, downright bor-\ning\u2014justifying rationales for this legislation. Their exist-\nence ought to be the end of this case. For they give the lie\nto the Court\u2019s conclusion that only those with hateful\nhearts could have voted \u201caye\u201d on this Act. And more\nimportantly, they serve to make the contents of the legis-\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

O\u2019Brien, 391\nU. S. 367, 383 (1968). Or at least it was a familiar princi-\nple. By holding to the contrary, the majority has declared\nopen season on any law that (in the opinion of the law\u2019s\nopponents and any panel of like-minded federal judges)\ncan be characterized as mean-spirited.\n   The majority concludes that the only motive for this Act\nwas the \u201cbare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular\ngroup.\u201d Ante, at 20. Bear in mind that the object of\nthis condemnation is not the legislature of some once-\nConfederate Southern state (familiar objects of the Court\u2019s\nscorn, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578\n(1987)), but our respected coordinate branches, the Con-\ngress and Presidency of the United States. Laying such a\ncharge against them should require the most extraordi-\nnary evidence, and I would have thought that every\nattempt would be made to indulge a more anodyne expla-\nnation for the statute. The majority does the opposite\u2014\naffirmatively concealing from the reader the arguments\nthat exist in justification. It makes only a passing men-\ntion of the \u201carguments put forward\u201d by the Act\u2019s defenders,\nand does not even trouble to paraphrase or describe them.\nSee ante, at 21. I imagine that this is because it is harder\nto maintain the illusion of the Act\u2019s supporters as unhinged\nmembers of a wild-eyed lynch mob when one first describes\ntheir views as they see them.\n   To choose just one of these defenders\u2019 arguments,\nDOMA avoids difficult choice-of-law issues that will now\narise absent a uniform federal definition of marriage. See,\ne.g., Baude, Beyond DOMA: Choice of State Law in Fed-\neral Statutes, 64 Stan. L. Rev. 1371 (2012). Imagine a pair\nof women who marry in Albany and then move to Ala-\nbama, which does not \u201crecognize as valid any marriage of\n20              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparties of the same sex.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a730\u20131\u201319(e) (2011).\nWhen the couple files their next federal tax return, may it\nbe a joint one? Which State\u2019s law controls, for federal-law\npurposes: their State of celebration (which recognizes the\nmarriage) or their State of domicile (which does not)?\n(Does the answer depend on whether they were just visit-\ning in Albany?) Are these questions to be answered as a\nmatter of federal common law, or perhaps by borrowing a\nState\u2019s choice-of-law rules? If so, which State\u2019s? And what\nabout States where the status of an out-of-state same-sex\nmarriage is an unsettled question under local law? See\nGodfrey v. Spano, 13 N. Y. 3d 358, 920 N. E. 2d 328\n(2009). DOMA avoided all of this uncertainty by speci-\nfying which marriages would be recognized for federal\npurposes. That is a classic purpose for a definitional\nprovision.\n   Further, DOMA preserves the intended effects of prior\nlegislation against then-unforeseen changes in circum-\nstance. When Congress provided (for example) that a\nspecial estate-tax exemption would exist for spouses, this\nexemption reached only opposite-sex spouses\u2014those being\nthe only sort that were recognized in any State at the time\nof DOMA\u2019s passage. When it became clear that changes in\nstate law might one day alter that balance, DOMA\u2019s defi-\nnitional section was enacted to ensure that state-level\nexperimentation did not automatically alter the basic\noperation of federal law, unless and until Congress made\nthe further judgment to do so on its own. That is not\nanimus\u2014just stabilizing prudence. Congress has hardly\ndemonstrated itself unwilling to make such further, revis-\ning judgments upon due deliberation. See, e.g., Don\u2019t Ask,\nDon\u2019t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, 124 Stat. 3515.\n   The Court mentions none of this. Instead, it accuses the\nCongress that enacted this law and the President who\nsigned it of something much worse than, for example,\nhaving acted in excess of enumerated federal powers\u2014or\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\neven having drawn distinctions that prove to be irrational.\nThose legal errors may be made in good faith, errors\nthough they are. But the majority says that the support-\ners of this Act acted with malice\u2014with the \u201cpurpose\u201d (ante,\nat 25) \u201cto disparage and to injure\u201d same-sex couples. It\nsays that the motivation for DOMA was to \u201cdemean,\u201d\nibid.; to \u201cimpose inequality,\u201d ante, at 22; to \u201cimpose . . . a\nstigma,\u201d ante, at 21; to deny people \u201cequal dignity,\u201d ibid.;\nto brand gay people as \u201cunworthy,\u201d ante, at 23; and to\n\u201chumiliat[e]\u201d their children, ibid. (emphasis added).\n   I am sure these accusations are quite untrue. To be\nsure (as the majority points out), the legislation is called\nthe Defense of Marriage Act. But to defend traditional\nmarriage is not to condemn, demean, or humiliate those\nwho would prefer other arrangements, any more than to\ndefend the Constitution of the United States is to con-\ndemn, demean, or humiliate other constitutions. To hurl\nsuch accusations so casually demeans this institution. In\nthe majority\u2019s judgment, any resistance to its holding is\nbeyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its\nhigh-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute\nis to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to \u201cdis-\nparage,\u201d \u201dinjure,\u201d \u201cdegrade,\u201d \u201ddemean,\u201d and \u201chumiliate\u201d our\nfellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homo-\nsexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did\nno more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been\nunquestioned in our society for most of its existence\u2014\nindeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for\nvirtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society\nto elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose\nchange by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani\ngeneris, enemies of the human race.\n                      *      *    *\n  The penultimate sentence of the majority\u2019s opinion is a\nnaked declaration that \u201c[t]his opinion and its holding are\n22               UNITED STATES v.

Now we are told that DOMA is invalid because it\n\u201cdemeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the\nConstitution protects,\u201d ante, at 23\u2014with an accompanying\ncitation of Lawrence. It takes real cheek for today\u2019s major-\nity to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitu-\ntional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex\nmarriage is not at issue here\u2014when what has preceded\nthat assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority\u2019s\nmoral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the\nCongress\u2019s hateful moral judgment against it. I promise\nyou this: The only thing that will \u201cconfine\u201d the Court\u2019s\nholding is its sense of what it can get away with.\n   I do not mean to suggest disagreement with THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE\u2019s view, ante, p. 2\u20134 (dissenting opinion), that\nlower federal courts and state courts can distinguish\ntoday\u2019s case when the issue before them is state denial\nof marital status to same-sex couples\u2014or even that this\nCourt could theoretically do so. Lord, an opinion with such\nscatter-shot rationales as this one (federalism noises\namong them) can be distinguished in many ways. And\ndeserves to be. State and lower federal courts should take\nthe Court at its word and distinguish away.\n   In my opinion, however, the view that this Court will\ntake of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated\nbeyond mistaking by today\u2019s opinion. As I have said, the\nreal rationale of today\u2019s opinion, whatever disappearing\ntrail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to follow, is\nthat DOMA is motivated by \u201c \u2018bare . . . desire to harm\u2019 \u201d\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

How easy it\nis, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion\nwith regard to state laws denying same-sex couples mari-\ntal status.

Responsibilities, as well as rights,\n    enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And\n    DOMA this state law contrives to deprive some cou-\n    ples married under the laws of their State enjoying\n    constitutionally protected sexual relationships, but not\n    other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.\u201d\nOr try this passage, from ante, at 22\u201323:\n    \u201c[DOMA] This state law tells those couples, and all\n    the world, that their otherwise valid marriages rela-\n    tionships are unworthy of federal state recognition.\n    This places same-sex couples in an unstable position\n    of being in a second-tier marriage relationship.

That debate is, at bottom, about the nature\nof the institution of marriage. Respondent Edith Windsor,\nsupported by the United States, asks this Court to inter-\nvene in that debate, and although she couches her argu-\nment in different terms, what she seeks is a holding that\nenshrines in the Constitution a particular understanding\nof marriage under which the sex of the partners makes\nno difference. The Constitution, however, does not dictate\nthat choice. It leaves the choice to the people, acting\nthrough their elected representatives at both the federal\nand state levels. I would therefore hold that Congress did\nnot violate Windsor\u2019s constitutional rights by enacting \u00a73\nof the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419,\nwhich defines the meaning of marriage under federal\nstatutes that either confer upon married persons cer-\ntain federal benefits or impose upon them certain federal\nobligations.\n                              I\n  I turn first to the question of standing. In my view, the\n2                  UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States clearly is not a proper petitioner in this\ncase. The United States does not ask us to overturn the\njudgment of the court below or to alter that judgment in\nany way. Quite to the contrary, the United States argues\nemphatically in favor of the correctness of that judgment.\nWe have never before reviewed a decision at the sole\nbehest of a party that took such a position, and to do so\nwould be to render an advisory opinion, in violation of\nArticle III\u2019s dictates. For the reasons given in JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s dissent, I do not find the Court\u2019s arguments to\nthe contrary to be persuasive.\n   Whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the\nHouse of Representatives (BLAG) has standing to\npetition is a much more difficult question. It is also a signifi-\ncantly closer question than whether the intervenors in Hol\u00ad\nlingsworth v. Perry, ante, p. ___ \u2014which the Court also\ndecides today\u2014have standing to appeal. It is remarkable\nthat the Court has simultaneously decided that the United\nStates, which \u201creceive[d] all that [it] ha[d] sought\u201d below,\nDeposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333\n(1980), is a proper petitioner in this case but that the\nintervenors in Hollingsworth, who represent the party\nthat lost in the lower court, are not. In my view, both the\nHollingsworth intervenors and BLAG have standing.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Our precedents make clear that, in order to support our jurisdic-\n\ntion, BLAG must demonstrate that it had Article III standing in its own\nright, quite apart from its status as an intervenor.

In the present case, the House of Repre-\nsentatives, which has authorized BLAG to represent its\ninterests in this matter,2 suffered just such an injury.\n   In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), the Court held\nthat the two Houses of Congress were \u201cproper parties\u201d to\nfile a petition in defense of the constitutionality of the\none-house veto statute, id., at 930, n. 5 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court granted and\ndecided petitions by both the Senate and the House, in\naddition to the Executive\u2019s petition. Id., at 919, n. *. That\nthe two Houses had standing to petition is not surprising:\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Chadha, by holding the\none-house veto to be unconstitutional, had limited Con-\ngress\u2019 power to legislate. In discussing Article III stand-\ning, the Court suggested that Congress suffered a similar\ninjury whenever federal legislation it had passed was\nstruck down, noting that it had \u201clong held that Congress is\nthe proper party to defend the validity of a statute when\nan agency of government, as a defendant charged with\nenforcing the statute, agrees with plaintiffs that the stat-\nute is inapplicable or unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 940.\n   The United States attempts to distinguish Chadha on\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nat 65 (\u201cAn intervenor cannot step into the shoes of the original party\nunless the intervenor independently fulfills the requirements of Article\nIII\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  2 H.

WINDSOR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe ground that it \u201cinvolved an unusual statute that vested\nthe House and the Senate themselves each with special\nprocedural rights\u2014namely, the right effectively to veto\nExecutive action.\u201d Brief for United States (jurisdiction)\n36. But that is a distinction without a difference: just as\nthe Court of Appeals decision that the Chadha Court\naffirmed impaired Congress\u2019 power by striking down the\none-house veto, so the Second Circuit\u2019s decision here im-\npairs Congress\u2019 legislative power by striking down an Act\nof Congress. The United States has not explained why the\nfact that the impairment at issue in Chadha was \u201cspecial\u201d\nor \u201cprocedural\u201d has any relevance to whether Congress\nsuffered an injury. Indeed, because legislating is Con-\ngress\u2019 central function, any impairment of that function is\na more grievous injury than the impairment of a proce-\ndural add-on.\n   The Court\u2019s decision in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433\n(1939), bolsters this conclusion. In Coleman, we held that\na group of state senators had standing to challenge a lower\ncourt decision approving the procedures used to ratify\nan amendment to the Federal Constitution. We reasoned\nthat the senators\u2019 votes\u2014which would otherwise have\ncarried the day\u2014were nullified by that action. See id., at\n438 (\u201cHere, the plaintiffs include twenty senators, whose\nvotes against ratification have been overridden and virtu-\nally held for naught although if they are right in their\ncontentions their votes would have been sufficient to\ndefeat ratification.

By striking\ndown \u00a73 of DOMA as unconstitutional, the Second Circuit\neffectively \u201cheld for naught\u201d an Act of Congress. Just as\nthe state-senator-petitioners in Coleman were necessary\nparties to the amendment\u2019s ratification, the House of\nRepresentatives was a necessary party to DOMA\u2019s pas-\nsage; indeed, the House\u2019s vote would have been sufficient\nto prevent DOMA\u2019s repeal if the Court had not chosen to\nexecute that repeal judicially.\n  Both the United States and the Court-appointed amicus\nerr in arguing that Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811 (1997), is\nto the contrary. In that case, the Court held that Mem-\nbers of Congress who had voted \u201cnay\u201d to the Line Item\nVeto Act did not have standing to challenge that statute\nin federal court. Raines is inapposite for two reasons.\nFirst, Raines dealt with individual Members of Congress\nand specifically pointed to the individual Members\u2019 lack\nof institutional endorsement as a sign of their standing\nproblem: \u201cWe attach some importance to the fact that\nappellees have not been authorized to represent their\nrespective Houses of Congress in this action, and indeed\nboth Houses actively oppose their suit.\u201d Id., at 829; see\nalso ibid., n. 10 (citing cases to the effect that \u201cmembers of\ncollegial bodies do not have standing to perfect an appeal\nthe body itself has declined to take\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n  Second, the Members in Raines\u2014unlike the state sena-\ntors in Coleman\u2014were not the pivotal figures whose votes\nwould have caused the Act to fail absent some challenged\naction. Indeed, it is telling that Raines characterized\nColeman as standing \u201cfor the proposition that legislators\nwhose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact)\na specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legis-\nlative action goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on\nthe ground that their votes have been completely nulli-\n6                 UNITED STATES v.

I, \u00a77 (bicameralism and presentment requirements for\nlegislation).\n   I appreciate the argument that the Constitution confers\non the President alone the authority to defend federal law\nin litigation, but in my view, as I have explained, that\nargument is contrary to the Court\u2019s holding in Chadha,\nand it is certainly contrary to the Chadha Court\u2019s en-\ndorsement of the principle that \u201cCongress is the proper\nparty to defend the validity of a statute\u201d when the Execu-\ntive refuses to do so on constitutional grounds. 462 U.

But it is well established\nthat any \u201csubstantive\u201d component to the Due Process\nClause protects only \u201cthose fundamental rights and lib-\nerties which are, objectively, \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s\nhistory and tradition,\u2019 \u201d Washington v.

See Goodridge v. Department of\nPublic Health, 440 Mass. 309, 798 N. E. 2d 941. Nor is the\nright to same-sex marriage deeply rooted in the traditions\nof other nations.

WINDSOR\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   What Windsor and the United States seek, therefore, is\nnot the protection of a deeply rooted right but the recogni-\ntion of a very new right, and they seek this innovation not\nfrom a legislative body elected by the people, but from\nunelected judges. Faced with such a request, judges have\ncause for both caution and humility.\n   The family is an ancient and universal human institu-\ntion. Family structure reflects the characteristics of a\ncivilization, and changes in family structure and in the\npopular understanding of marriage and the family can\nhave profound effects. Past changes in the understand-\ning of marriage\u2014for example, the gradual ascendance of\nthe idea that romantic love is a prerequisite to marriage\u2014\nhave had far-reaching consequences. But the process by\nwhich such consequences come about is complex, involving\nthe interaction of numerous factors, and tends to occur\nover an extended period of time.\n   We can expect something similar to take place if same-\nsex marriage becomes widely accepted. The long-term\nconsequences of this change are not now known and are\nunlikely to be ascertainable for some time to come.5 There\nare those who think that allowing same-sex marriage will\nseriously undermine the institution of marriage. See, e.g.,\nS. Girgis, R. Anderson, & R.

The\nMembers of this Court have the authority and the respon-\nsibility to interpret and apply the Constitution. Thus, if\nthe Constitution contained a provision guaranteeing the\nright to marry a person of the same sex, it would be our\nduty to enforce that right. But the Constitution simply\ndoes not speak to the issue of same-sex marriage. In our\nsystem of government, ultimate sovereignty rests with the\npeople, and the people have the right to control their own\ndestiny. Any change on a question so fundamental should\nbe made by the people through their elected officials.\n                             III\n  Perhaps because they cannot show that same-sex mar-\nriage is a fundamental right under our Constitution,\nWindsor and the United States couch their arguments in\nequal protection terms. They argue that \u00a73 of DOMA\ndiscriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, that\nclassifications based on sexual orientation should trigger a\nform of \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, and that \u00a73 cannot survive\nsuch scrutiny. They further maintain that the govern-\nmental interests that \u00a73 purports to serve are not suffi-\nciently important and that it has not been adequately\nshown that \u00a73 serves those interests very well.

Our equal protection frame-\nwork, upon which Windsor and the United States rely,\nis a judicial construct that provides a useful mechanism\nfor analyzing a certain universe of equal protection\ncases. But that framework is ill suited for use in evaluat-\ning the constitutionality of laws based on the traditional\nunderstanding of marriage, which fundamentally turn on\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

That is a striking\nrequest and one that unelected judges should pause before\ngranting. Acceptance of the argument would cast all those\nwho cling to traditional beliefs about the nature of mar-\nriage in the role of bigots or superstitious fools.\n   By asking the Court to strike down DOMA as not satis-\nfying some form of heightened scrutiny, Windsor and the\nUnited States are really seeking to have the Court resolve\na debate between two competing views of marriage.\n   The first and older view, which I will call the \u201ctradi-\ntional\u201d or \u201cconjugal\u201d view, sees marriage as an intrinsically\nopposite-sex institution. BLAG notes that virtually every\nculture, including many not influenced by the Abrahamic\nreligions, has limited marriage to people of the opposite\nsex. Brief for Respondent BLAG (merits) 2 (citing Her\u00ad\nnandez v. Robles, 7 N. Y. 3d 338, 361, 855 N. E. 2d 1, 8\n(2006) (\u201cUntil a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth\nfor almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which\nmarriage existed, that there could be marriages only\nbetween participants of different sex\u201d)). And BLAG at-\ntempts to explain this phenomenon by arguing that the\ninstitution of marriage was created for the purpose of\nchanneling heterosexual intercourse into a structure that\nsupports child rearing. Brief for Respondent BLAG 44\u201346,\n49. Others explain the basis for the institution in more\nphilosophical terms. They argue that marriage is essen-\ntially the solemnizing of a comprehensive, exclusive, per-\nmanent union that is intrinsically ordered to producing\nnew life, even if it does not always do so. See, e.g., Girgis,\nAnderson, & George, What is Marriage? Man and Woman:\n14                  UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nA Defense, at 23\u201328. While modern cultural changes have\nweakened the link between marriage and procreation in\nthe popular mind, there is no doubt that, throughout\nhuman history and across many cultures, marriage has\nbeen viewed as an exclusively opposite-sex institution\nand as one inextricably linked to procreation and biologi-\ncal kinship.\n   The other, newer view is what I will call the \u201cconsent-\nbased\u201d vision of marriage, a vision that primarily defines\nmarriage as the solemnization of mutual commitment\u2014\nmarked by strong emotional attachment and sexual at-\ntraction\u2014between two persons. At least as it applies to\nheterosexual couples, this view of marriage now plays a\nvery prominent role in the popular understanding of the\ninstitution. Indeed, our popular culture is infused with\nthis understanding of marriage. Proponents of same-sex\nmarriage argue that because gender differentiation is not\nrelevant to this vision, the exclusion of same-sex couples\nfrom the institution of marriage is rank discrimination.\n   The Constitution does not codify either of these views of\nmarriage (although I suspect it would have been hard at\nthe time of the adoption of the Constitution or the Fifth\nAmendment to find Americans who did not take the tradi-\ntional view for granted). The silence of the Constitution\non this question should be enough to end the matter as\nfar as the judiciary is concerned. Yet, Windsor and the\nUnited States implicitly ask us to endorse the consent-based\nview of marriage and to reject the traditional view, there-\nby arrogating to ourselves the power to decide a question\nthat philosophers, historians, social scientists, and theolo-\ngians are better qualified to explore.7 Because our consti-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The degree to which this question is intractable to typical judicial\n\nprocesses of decisionmaking was highlighted by the trial in Hol\u00ad\nlingsworth v.

Only an arrogant\nlegal culture that has lost all appreciation of its own limitations could\ntake such a suggestion seriously.\n16              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  Legislatures, however, have little choice but to decide\nbetween the two views. We have long made clear that\nneither the political branches of the Federal Government\nnor state governments are required to be neutral between\ncompeting visions of the good, provided that the vision of\nthe good that they adopt is not countermanded by the\nConstitution. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173,\n192 (1991) (\u201c[T]he government \u2018may make a value judg-\nment favoring childbirth over abortion\u2019 \u201d (quoting Maher v.\nRue, 432 U. S. 464, 474 (1977))). Accordingly, both Con-\ngress and the States are entitled to enact laws recognizing\neither of the two understandings of marriage. And given\nthe size of government and the degree to which it now\nregulates daily life, it seems unlikely that either Congress\nor the States could maintain complete neutrality even if\nthey tried assiduously to do so.\n  Rather than fully embracing the arguments made by\nWindsor and the United States, the Court strikes down \u00a73\nof DOMA as a classification not properly supported by its\nobjectives. The Court reaches this conclusion in part\nbecause it believes that \u00a73 encroaches upon the States\u2019\nsovereign prerogative to define marriage. See ante, at 21\u2013\n22 (\u201cAs the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its\npurpose is to discourage enactment of state same-sex\nmarriage laws and to restrict the freedom and choice of\ncouples married under those laws if they are enacted.

Indeed, the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion is\nthat DOMA falls afoul of the Fifth Amendment because it\n\u201csingles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled\nto recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty\u201d\nand \u201cimposes a disability on the class by refusing to\nacknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

I hope that\nthe Court will ultimately permit the people of each State\nto decide this question for themselves. Unless the Court is\nwilling to allow this to occur, the whiffs of federalism in\nthe today\u2019s opinion of the Court will soon be scattered to\nthe wind.\n   In any event, \u00a73 of DOMA, in my view, does not en-\ncroach on the prerogatives of the States, assuming of\ncourse that the many federal statutes affected by DOMA\nhave not already done so. Section 3 does not prevent any\nState from recognizing same-sex marriage or from extend-\ning to same-sex couples any right, privilege, benefit, or\nobligation stemming from state law. All that \u00a73 does is to\ndefine a class of persons to whom federal law extends cer-\ntain special benefits and upon whom federal law imposes\ncertain special burdens. In these provisions, Congress\nused marital status as a way of defining this class\u2014in\npart, I assume, because it viewed marriage as a valua-\nble institution to be fostered and in part because it viewed\nmarried couples as comprising a unique type of economic\nunit that merits special regulatory treatment. Assuming\nthat Congress has the power under the Constitution to\nenact the laws affected by \u00a73, Congress has the power to\ndefine the category of persons to whom those laws apply.\n                        *   *    *\n  For these reasons, I would hold that \u00a73 of DOMA does\nnot violate the Fifth Amendment.

Argued March 27, 2013\u2014Decided June 26, 2013\nThe State of New York recognizes the marriage of New York residents\n  Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, who wed in Ontario, Canada, in\n  2007. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.\n  Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviv-\n  ing spouses, but was barred from doing so by \u00a73 of the federal De-\n  fense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which amended the Dictionary Act\u2014a\n  law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and\n  the whole realm of federal regulations\u2014to define \u201cmarriage\u201d and\n  \u201cspouse\u201d as excluding same-sex partners. Windsor paid $363,053 in\n  estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service\n  denied. Windsor brought this refund suit, contending that DOMA vi-\n  olates the principles of equal protection incorporated in the Fifth\n  Amendment. While the suit was pending, the Attorney General noti-\n  fied the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Depart-\n  ment of Justice would no longer defend \u00a73\u2019s constitutionality. In re-\n  sponse, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of\n  Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend \u00a73\u2019s\n  constitutionality. The District Court permitted the intervention. On\n  the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding \u00a73 un-\n  constitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsor\u2019s tax\n  with interest. The Second Circuit affirmed. The United States has\n  not complied with the judgment.\nHeld:\n    1. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.\n This case clearly presented a concrete disagreement between oppos-\n ing parties that was suitable for judicial resolution in the District\n Court, but the Executive\u2019s decision not to defend \u00a73\u2019s constitutionali-\n2                     UNITED STATES v.

Given the Government\u2019s concession, ami-\n    cus contends, once the District Court ordered the refund, the case\n    should have ended and the appeal been dismissed. But this argu-\n    ment elides the distinction between Article III\u2019s jurisdictional re-\n    quirements and the prudential limits on its exercise, which are \u201ces-\n    sentially matters of judicial self-governance.\u201d Warth v. Seldin, 422\n    U. S. 490, 500. Here, the United States retains a stake sufficient to\n    support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in this Court. The re-\n    fund it was ordered to pay Windsor is \u201ca real and immediate econom-\n    ic injury,\u201d Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S.\n    587, 599, even if the Executive disagrees with \u00a73 of DOMA. Wind-\n    sor\u2019s ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay\n    thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\n    Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919.\n       Prudential considerations, however, demand that there be \u201ccon-\n    crete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon\n    which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult consti-\n    tutional questions.\u201d Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204. Unlike Article\n    III requirements\u2014which must be satisfied by the parties before judi-\n    cial consideration is appropriate\u2014prudential factors that counsel\n    against hearing this case are subject to \u201ccountervailing considera-\n    tions [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluc-\n    tance to exert judicial power.\u201d Warth, supra, at 500\u2013501. One such\n    consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the\n    issues is ensured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to de-\n    fend with vigor the legislative act\u2019s constitutionality. See Chadha,\n    supra, at 940. Here, BLAG\u2019s substantial adversarial argument for\n    \u00a73\u2019s constitutionality satisfies prudential concerns that otherwise\n    might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which\n    the principal parties agree. This conclusion does not mean that it is\n    appropriate for the Executive as a routine exercise to challenge stat-\n    utes in court instead of making the case to Congress for amendment\n    or repeal. But this case is not routine, and BLAG\u2019s capable defense\n    ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question,\n    which is of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to\n    hundreds of thousands of persons.

S. ____ (2013)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\nthe whole realm of federal regulations, has a far greater reach. Its\noperation is also directed to a class of persons that the laws of New\nYork, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect. Assessing the\nvalidity of that intervention requires discussing the historical and\ntraditional extent of state power and authority over marriage.\n   Subject to certain constitutional guarantees, see, e.g., Loving v.\nVirginia, 388 U. S. 1, \u201cregulation of domestic relations\u201d is \u201can area\nthat has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the\nStates,\u201d Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 404. The significance of state\nresponsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to\nthe Nation\u2019s beginning; for \u201cwhen the Constitution was adopted the\ncommon understanding was that the domestic relations of husband\nand wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States,\u201d\nOhio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379, 383\u2013384. Marriage laws\nmay vary from State to State, but they are consistent within each\nState.\n   DOMA rejects this long-established precept. The State\u2019s decision\nto give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a\ndignity and status of immense import. But the Federal Government\nuses the state-defined class for the opposite purpose\u2014to impose re-\nstrictions and disabilities. The question is whether the resulting in-\njury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment, since what New York treats as\nalike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the\nsame class the State seeks to protect. New York\u2019s actions were a\nproper exercise of its sovereign authority. They reflect both the\ncommunity\u2019s considered perspective on the historical roots of the in-\nstitution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning\nof equality. Pp. 13\u201320.\n     (b) By seeking to injure the very class New York seeks to protect,\nDOMA violates basic due process and equal protection principles ap-\nplicable to the Federal Government. The Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nequality \u201cmust at the very least mean that a bare congressional de-\nsire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot\u201d justify disparate\ntreatment of that group. Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413\nU. S. 528, 534\u2013535. DOMA cannot survive under these principles.\nIts unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting\nstate definitions of marriage operates to deprive same-sex couples of\nthe benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of\ntheir marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose\nand effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state\nlaw. DOMA\u2019s avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a\ndisadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter\ninto same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority\n4                    UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    of the States.\n       DOMA\u2019s history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that\n    interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, conferred\n    by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than\n    an incidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence. BLAG\u2019s\n    arguments are just as candid about the congressional purpose.\n    DOMA\u2019s operation in practice confirms this purpose. It frustrates\n    New York\u2019s objective of eliminating inequality by writing inequality\n    into the entire United States Code.\n       DOMA\u2019s principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of\n    state-sanctioned marriages. It contrives to deprive some couples\n    married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights\n    and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes\n    within the same State. It also forces same-sex couples to live as mar-\n    ried for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of\n    federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic\n    personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and\n    protect.

EDITH SCHLAIN\n  WINDSOR, IN HER CAPACITY AS EXECUTOR OF THE\n     ESTATE OF THEA CLARA SPYER, ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n           APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n                                 [June 26, 2013]\n\n  JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  Two women then resident in New York were married\nin a lawful ceremony in Ontario, Canada, in 2007. Edith\nWindsor and Thea Spyer returned to their home in New\nYork City. When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire\nestate to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the estate tax\nexemption for surviving spouses. She was barred from\ndoing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Mar-\nriage Act, which excludes a same-sex partner from the\ndefinition of \u201cspouse\u201d as that term is used in federal stat-\nutes. Windsor paid the taxes but filed suit to challenge\nthe constitutionality of this provision. The United States\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that this\nportion of the statute is unconstitutional and ordered the\nUnited States to pay Windsor a refund. This Court granted\ncertiorari and now affirms the judgment in Windsor\u2019s\nfavor.\n                           I\n  In 1996, as some States were beginning to consider the\nconcept of same-sex marriage, see, e.g., Baehr v. Lewin, 74\n2               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nHaw. 530, 852 P. 2d 44 (1993), and before any State had\nacted to permit it, Congress enacted the Defense of Mar-\nriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419. DOMA contains two\noperative sections: Section 2, which has not been chal-\nlenged here, allows States to refuse to recognize same-sex\nmarriages performed under the laws of other States. See\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71738C.\n  Section 3 is at issue here. It amends the Dictionary Act\nin Title 1, \u00a77, of the United States Code to provide a fed-\neral definition of \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cspouse.\u201d Section 3 of\nDOMA provides as follows:\n      \u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Con-\n    gress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of\n    the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the\n    United States, the word \u2018marriage\u2019 means only a\n    legal union between one man and one woman as hus-\n    band and wife, and the word \u2018spouse\u2019 refers only to a\n    person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\u201d\n    1 U. S. C. \u00a77.\n  The definitional provision does not by its terms forbid\nStates from enacting laws permitting same-sex marriages\nor civil unions or providing state benefits to residents in\nthat status. The enactment\u2019s comprehensive definition of\nmarriage for purposes of all federal statutes and other\nregulations or directives covered by its terms, however,\ndoes control over 1,000 federal laws in which marital or\nspousal status is addressed as a matter of federal law. See\nGAO, D. Shah, Defense of Marriage Act: Update to Prior\nReport 1 (GAO\u201304\u2013353R, 2004).\n  Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York City in\n1963 and began a long-term relationship. Windsor and\nSpyer registered as domestic partners when New York\nCity gave that right to same-sex couples in 1993. Con-\ncerned about Spyer\u2019s health, the couple made the 2007 trip\nto Canada for their marriage, but they continued to reside\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

See 699 F. 3d 169,\n177\u2013178 (CA2 2012).\n  Spyer died in February 2009, and left her entire estate\nto Windsor. Because DOMA denies federal recognition to\nsame-sex spouses, Windsor did not qualify for the marital\nexemption from the federal estate tax, which excludes\nfrom taxation \u201cany interest in property which passes or\nhas passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse.\u201d 26\nU. S. C. \u00a72056(a). Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes\nand sought a refund. The Internal Revenue Service de-\nnied the refund, concluding that, under DOMA, Windsor\nwas not a \u201csurviving spouse.\u201d        Windsor commenced\nthis refund suit in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York.         She contended\nthat DOMA violates the guarantee of equal protection,\nas applied to the Federal Government through the Fifth\nAmendment.\n  While the tax refund suit was pending, the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States notified the Speaker of the\nHouse of Representatives, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7530D,\nthat the Department of Justice would no longer defend the\nconstitutionality of DOMA\u2019s \u00a73. Noting that \u201cthe Depart-\nment has previously defended DOMA against . . . chal-\nlenges involving legally married same-sex couples,\u201d App.\n184, the Attorney General informed Congress that \u201cthe\nPresident has concluded that given a number of factors,\nincluding a documented history of discrimination, classifi-\ncations based on sexual orientation should be subject to\na heightened standard of scrutiny.\u201d Id., at 191. The De-\npartment of Justice has submitted many \u00a7530D letters\nover the years refusing to defend laws it deems unconsti-\ntutional, when, for instance, a federal court has rejected\nthe Government\u2019s defense of a statute and has issued a\njudgment against it. This case is unusual, however, be-\ncause the \u00a7530D letter was not preceded by an adverse\n4               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\njudgment. The letter instead reflected the Executive\u2019s\nown conclusion, relying on a definition still being debated\nand considered in the courts, that heightened equal pro-\ntection scrutiny should apply to laws that classify on the\nbasis of sexual orientation.\n   Although \u201cthe President . . . instructed the Department\nnot to defend the statute in Windsor,\u201d he also decided\n\u201cthat Section 3 will continue to be enforced by the Execu-\ntive Branch\u201d and that the United States had an \u201cinterest\nin providing Congress a full and fair opportunity to partic-\nipate in the litigation of those cases.\u201d Id., at 191\u2013193. The\nstated rationale for this dual-track procedure (determina-\ntion of unconstitutionality coupled with ongoing enforce-\nment) was to \u201crecogniz[e] the judiciary as the final arbiter\nof the constitutional claims raised.\u201d Id., at 192.\n   In response to the notice from the Attorney General,\nthe Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House\nof Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to\ndefend the constitutionality of \u00a73 of DOMA. The Depart-\nment of Justice did not oppose limited intervention by\nBLAG. The District Court denied BLAG\u2019s motion to enter\nthe suit as of right, on the rationale that the United States\nalready was represented by the Department of Justice.\nThe District Court, however, did grant intervention by\nBLAG as an interested party. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n24(a)(2).\n   On the merits of the tax refund suit, the District Court\nruled against the United States. It held that \u00a73 of DOMA\nis unconstitutional and ordered the Treasury to refund the\ntax with interest. Both the Justice Department and BLAG\nfiled notices of appeal, and the Solicitor General filed a\npetition for certiorari before judgment. Before this Court\nacted on the petition, the Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment. It applied\nheightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual\norientation, as both the Department and Windsor had\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Windsor has not received her refund, and the Ex-\necutive Branch continues to enforce \u00a73 of DOMA.\n   In granting certiorari on the question of the constitu-\ntionality of \u00a73 of DOMA, the Court requested argument\non two additional questions: whether the United States\u2019\nagreement with Windsor\u2019s legal position precludes further\nreview and whether BLAG has standing to appeal the\ncase. All parties agree that the Court has jurisdiction to\ndecide this case; and, with the case in that framework, the\nCourt appointed Professor Vicki Jackson as amicus curiae\nto argue the position that the Court lacks jurisdiction to\nhear the dispute. 568 U. S. ___ (2012). She has ably\ndischarged her duties.\n   In an unrelated case, the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the First Circuit has also held \u00a73 of DOMA to be\nunconstitutional. A petition for certiorari has been filed in\nthat case. Pet. for Cert. in Bipartisan Legal Advisory\nGroup v. Gill, O. T. 2012, No. 12\u201313.\n                               II\n  It is appropriate to begin by addressing whether either\nthe Government or BLAG, or both of them, were entitled\nto appeal to the Court of Appeals and later to seek certio-\nrari and appear as parties here.\n  There is no dispute that when this case was in the\nDistrict Court it presented a concrete disagreement be-\ntween opposing parties, a dispute suitable for judicial\nresolution. \u201c[A] taxpayer has standing to challenge the\ncollection of a specific tax assessment as unconstitutional;\nbeing forced to pay such a tax causes a real and immediate\neconomic injury to the individual taxpayer.\u201d Hein v. Free\u00ad\ndom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587, 599\n(2007) (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted). Windsor\nsuffered a redressable injury when she was required to\npay estate taxes from which, in her view, she was exempt\n6               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut for the alleged invalidity of \u00a73 of DOMA.\n   The decision of the Executive not to defend the constitu-\ntionality of \u00a73 in court while continuing to deny refunds\nand to assess deficiencies does introduce a complication.\nEven though the Executive\u2019s current position was an-\nnounced before the District Court entered its judgment,\nthe Government\u2019s agreement with Windsor\u2019s position would\nnot have deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to\nentertain and resolve the refund suit; for her injury (fail-\nure to obtain a refund allegedly required by law) was\nconcrete, persisting, and unredressed. The Government\u2019s\nposition\u2014agreeing with Windsor\u2019s legal contention but\nrefusing to give it effect\u2014meant that there was a justicia-\nble controversy between the parties, despite what the\nclaimant would find to be an inconsistency in that stance.\nWindsor, the Government, BLAG, and the amicus appear\nto agree upon that point. The disagreement is over the\nstanding of the parties, or aspiring parties, to take an\nappeal in the Court of Appeals and to appear as parties in\nfurther proceedings in this Court.\n   The amicus\u2019 position is that, given the Government\u2019s\nconcession that \u00a73 is unconstitutional, once the District\nCourt ordered the refund the case should have ended;\nand the amicus argues the Court of Appeals should have\ndismissed the appeal. The amicus submits that once\nthe President agreed with Windsor\u2019s legal position and the\nDistrict Court issued its judgment, the parties were no\nlonger adverse. From this standpoint the United States\nwas a prevailing party below, just as Windsor was. Ac-\ncordingly, the amicus reasons, it is inappropriate for this\nCourt to grant certiorari and proceed to rule on the merits;\nfor the United States seeks no redress from the judgment\nentered against it.\n   This position, however, elides the distinction between\ntwo principles: the jurisdictional requirements of Article\nIII and the prudential limits on its exercise.

The latter are \u201cessen-\ntially matters of judicial self-governance.\u201d Id., at 500.\nThe Court has kept these two strands separate: \u201cArticle\nIII standing, which enforces the Constitution\u2019s case-or-\ncontroversy requirement, see Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 559\u2013562 (1992); and prudential standing,\nwhich embodies \u2018judicially self-imposed limits on the exer-\ncise of federal jurisdiction,\u2019 Allen [v. Wright,] 468 U. S.\n[737,] 751 [(1984)].\u201d Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.\nNewdow, 542 U. S. 1, 11\u201312 (2004).\n   The requirements of Article III standing are familiar:\n    \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u2018injury in\n    fact\u2019\u2014an invasion of a legally protected interest which\n    is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) \u2018actual or\n    imminent, not \u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d \u2019 Second,\n    there must be a causal connection between the injury\n    and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury has to be\n    \u2018fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the\n    defendant, and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independ-\n    ent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\n    Third, it must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as opposed to merely \u2018specu-\n    lative,\u2019 that the injury will be \u2018redressed by a favor-\n    able decision.\u2019 \u201d Lujan, supra, at 560\u2013561 (footnote and\n    citations omitted).\nRules of prudential standing, by contrast, are more flex-\nible \u201crule[s] . . . of federal appellate practice,\u201d Deposit\nGuaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333 (1980),\ndesigned to protect the courts from \u201cdecid[ing] abstract\nquestions of wide public significance even [when] other\ngovernmental institutions may be more competent to ad-\ndress the questions and even though judicial intervention\nmay be unnecessary to protect individual rights.\u201d Warth,\nsupra, at 500.\n  In this case the United States retains a stake sufficient\nto support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in pro-\n8               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nceedings before this Court. The judgment in question\norders the United States to pay Windsor the refund she\nseeks. An order directing the Treasury to pay money is \u201ca\nreal and immediate economic injury,\u201d Hein, 551 U. S., at\n599, indeed as real and immediate as an order directing\nan individual to pay a tax. That the Executive may wel-\ncome this order to pay the refund if it is accompanied by\nthe constitutional ruling it wants does not eliminate the\ninjury to the national Treasury if payment is made, or to\nthe taxpayer if it is not. The judgment orders the United\nStates to pay money that it would not disburse but for the\ncourt\u2019s order. The Government of the United States has a\nvalid legal argument that it is injured even if the Execu-\ntive disagrees with \u00a73 of DOMA, which results in Wind-\nsor\u2019s liability for the tax. Windsor\u2019s ongoing claim for\nfunds that the United States refuses to pay thus estab-\nlishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.\nIt would be a different case if the Executive had taken\nthe further step of paying Windsor the refund to which she\nwas entitled under the District Court\u2019s ruling.\n   This Court confronted a comparable case in INS v.\nChadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983). A statute by its terms\nallowed one House of Congress to order the Immigration\nand Naturalization Service (INS) to deport the respondent\nChadha. There, as here, the Executive determined that\nthe statute was unconstitutional, and \u201cthe INS presented\nthe Executive\u2019s views on the constitutionality of the House\naction to the Court of Appeals.\u201d Id., at 930. The INS,\nhowever, continued to abide by the statute, and \u201cthe INS\nbrief to the Court of Appeals did not alter the agency\u2019s\ndecision to comply with the House action ordering depor-\ntation of Chadha.\u201d Ibid. This Court held \u201cthat the INS\nwas sufficiently aggrieved by the Court of Appeals deci-\nsion prohibiting it from taking action it would otherwise\ntake,\u201d ibid., regardless of whether the agency welcomed\nthe judgment.

S. ____ (2013)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsatisfy Article III was defined as a requirement that the\nCourt\u2019s \u201c \u2018decision will have real meaning: if we rule for\nChadha, he will not be deported; if we uphold [the stat-\nute], the INS will execute its order and deport him.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 939\u2013940 (quoting Chadha v. INS, 634 F. 2d 408, 419\n(CA9 1980)). This conclusion was not dictum. It was a\nnecessary predicate to the Court\u2019s holding that \u201cprior to\nCongress\u2019 intervention, there was adequate Art. III ad-\nverseness.\u201d 462 U. S., at 939. The holdings of cases are\ninstructive, and the words of Chadha make clear its hold-\ning that the refusal of the Executive to provide the relief\nsought suffices to preserve a justiciable dispute as re-\nquired by Article III. In short, even where \u201cthe Govern-\nment largely agree[s] with the opposing party on the\nmerits of the controversy,\u201d there is sufficient adverseness\nand an \u201cadequate basis for jurisdiction in the fact that\nthe Government intended to enforce the challenged law\nagainst that party.\u201d Id., at 940, n. 12.\n   It is true that \u201c[a] party who receives all that he has\nsought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment afford-\ning the relief and cannot appeal from it.\u201d Roper, supra, at\n333, see also Camreta v. Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 8) (\u201cAs a matter of practice and prudence, we\nhave generally declined to consider cases at the request of\na prevailing party, even when the Constitution allowed us\nto do so\u201d). But this rule \u201cdoes not have its source in the\njurisdictional limitations of Art. III. In an appropriate\ncase, appeal may be permitted . . . at the behest of the\nparty who has prevailed on the merits, so long as that\nparty retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the require-\nments of Art. III.\u201d Roper, supra, at 333\u2013334.\n   While these principles suffice to show that this case\npresents a justiciable controversy under Article III, the\nprudential problems inherent in the Executive\u2019s unusual\nposition require some further discussion.

TVA, 297 U. S.\n288, 346 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (quoting Chicago\n& Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 U. S. 339,\n345 (1892)). Even when Article III permits the exercise\nof federal jurisdiction, prudential considerations demand\nthat the Court insist upon \u201cthat concrete adverseness\nwhich sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the\ncourt so largely depends for illumination of difficult consti-\ntutional questions.\u201d Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204\n(1962).\n   There are, of course, reasons to hear a case and issue a\nruling even when one party is reluctant to prevail in its\nposition. Unlike Article III requirements\u2014which must\nbe satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is\nappropriate\u2014the relevant prudential factors that counsel\nagainst hearing this case are subject to \u201ccountervailing\nconsiderations [that] may outweigh the concerns underly-\ning the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.\u201d Warth,\n422 U. S., at 500\u2013501. One consideration is the extent to\nwhich adversarial presentation of the issues is assured by\nthe participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with\nvigor the constitutionality of the legislative act. With\nrespect to this prudential aspect of standing as well, the\nChadha Court encountered a similar situation. It noted\nthat \u201cthere may be prudential, as opposed to Art. III,\nconcerns about sanctioning the adjudication of [this case]\nin the absence of any participant supporting the validity of\n[the statute]. The Court of Appeals properly dispelled any\nsuch concerns by inviting and accepting briefs from both\nHouses of Congress.\u201d 462 U. S., at 940. Chadha was not\nan anomaly in this respect. The Court adopts the practice\nof entertaining arguments made by an amicus when the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nSolicitor General confesses error with respect to a judg-\nment below, even if the confession is in effect an admission\nthat an Act of Congress is unconstitutional. See, e.g.,\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428 (2000).\n   In the case now before the Court the attorneys for BLAG\npresent a substantial argument for the constitutionality\nof \u00a73 of DOMA. BLAG\u2019s sharp adversarial presentation of\nthe issues satisfies the prudential concerns that otherwise\nmight counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision\nwith which the principal parties agree. Were this Court\nto hold that prudential rules require it to dismiss the case,\nand, in consequence, that the Court of Appeals erred in\nfailing to dismiss it as well, extensive litigation would\nensue. The district courts in 94 districts throughout the\nNation would be without precedential guidance not only in\ntax refund suits but also in cases involving the whole of\nDOMA\u2019s sweep involving over 1,000 federal statutes and a\nmyriad of federal regulations. For instance, the opinion of\nthe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, addressing the\nvalidity of DOMA in a case involving regulations of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, likely would\nbe vacated with instructions to dismiss, its ruling and\nguidance also then erased. See Massachusetts v. United\nStates Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F. 3d 1\n(CA1 2012). Rights and privileges of hundreds of thou-\nsands of persons would be adversely affected, pending a\ncase in which all prudential concerns about justiciability\nare absent. That numerical prediction may not be certain,\nbut it is certain that the cost in judicial resources and\nexpense of litigation for all persons adversely affected\nwould be immense. True, the very extent of DOMA\u2019s\nmandate means that at some point a case likely would\narise without the prudential concerns raised here; but the\ncosts, uncertainties, and alleged harm and injuries likely\nwould continue for a time measured in years before the\nissue is resolved. In these unusual and urgent circum-\n12              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances, the very term \u201cprudential\u201d counsels that it is a\nproper exercise of the Court\u2019s responsibility to take juris-\ndiction. For these reasons, the prudential and Article III\nrequirements are met here; and, as a consequence, the\nCourt need not decide whether BLAG would have stand-\ning to challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling and its affir-\nmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG\u2019s own authority.\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion that this petition may be heard\non the merits does not imply that no difficulties would\nensue if this were a common practice in ordinary cases.\nThe Executive\u2019s failure to defend the constitutionality of\nan Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet\nestablished in judicial decisions has created a procedural\ndilemma. On the one hand, as noted, the Government\u2019s\nagreement with Windsor raises questions about the pro-\npriety of entertaining a suit in which it seeks affirmance of\nan order invalidating a federal law and ordering the United\nStates to pay money. On the other hand, if the Execu-\ntive\u2019s agreement with a plaintiff that a law is unconsti-\ntutional is enough to preclude judicial review, then the\nSupreme Court\u2019s primary role in determining the constitu-\ntionality of a law that has inflicted real injury on a plain-\ntiff who has brought a justiciable legal claim would\nbecome only secondary to the President\u2019s. This would\nundermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers\nprinciple that \u201cwhen an Act of Congress is alleged to con-\nflict with the Constitution, \u2018[i]t is emphatically the prov-\nince and duty of the judicial department to say what the\nlaw is.\u2019 \u201d Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n(slip op., at 7) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137,\n177 (1803)). Similarly, with respect to the legislative\npower, when Congress has passed a statute and a Presi-\ndent has signed it, it poses grave challenges to the separa-\ntion of powers for the Executive at a particular moment to\nbe able to nullify Congress\u2019 enactment solely on its own\ninitiative and without any determination from the Court.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  The Court\u2019s jurisdictional holding, it must be under-\nscored, does not mean the arguments for dismissing this\ndispute on prudential grounds lack substance. Yet the\ndifficulty the Executive faces should be acknowledged.\nWhen the Executive makes a principled determination\nthat a statute is unconstitutional, it faces a difficult\nchoice. Still, there is no suggestion here that it is appro-\npriate for the Executive as a matter of course to challenge\nstatutes in the judicial forum rather than making the case\nto Congress for their amendment or repeal. The integrity\nof the political process would be at risk if difficult consti-\ntutional issues were simply referred to the Court as a\nroutine exercise. But this case is not routine. And the\ncapable defense of the law by BLAG ensures that these\nprudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which\nis one of immediate importance to the Federal Govern-\nment and to hundreds of thousands of persons. These cir-\ncumstances support the Court\u2019s decision to proceed to the\nmerits.\n                             III\n   When at first Windsor and Spyer longed to marry, nei-\nther New York nor any other State granted them that\nright. After waiting some years, in 2007 they traveled to\nOntario to be married there. It seems fair to conclude\nthat, until recent years, many citizens had not even con-\nsidered the possibility that two persons of the same sex\nmight aspire to occupy the same status and dignity as that\nof a man and woman in lawful marriage. For marriage\nbetween a man and a woman no doubt had been thought\nof by most people as essential to the very definition of that\nterm and to its role and function throughout the history of\ncivilization. That belief, for many who long have held it,\nbecame even more urgent, more cherished when chal-\nlenged. For others, however, came the beginnings of a\nnew perspective, a new insight. Accordingly some States\n14              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nconcluded that same-sex marriage ought to be given\nrecognition and validity in the law for those same-sex\ncouples who wish to define themselves by their commit-\nment to each other. The limitation of lawful marriage\nto heterosexual couples, which for centuries had been\ndeemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be\nseen in New York and certain other States as an unjust\nexclusion.\n   Slowly at first and then in rapid course, the laws of\nNew York came to acknowledge the urgency of this issue for\nsame-sex couples who wanted to affirm their commitment\nto one another before their children, their family, their\nfriends, and their community. And so New York recog-\nnized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere; and then\nit later amended its own marriage laws to permit same-\nsex marriage. New York, in common with, as of this writ-\ning, 11 other States and the District of Columbia, decided\nthat same-sex couples should have the right to marry and\nso live with pride in themselves and their union and in a\nstatus of equality with all other married persons. After a\nstatewide deliberative process that enabled its citizens to\ndiscuss and weigh arguments for and against same-\nsex marriage, New York acted to enlarge the definition of\nmarriage to correct what its citizens and elected repre-\nsentatives perceived to be an injustice that they had not\nearlier known or understood. See Marriage Equality Act,\n2011 N. Y. Laws 749 (codified at N. Y. Dom. Rel. Law Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a710\u2013a, 10\u2013b, 13 (West 2013)).\n   Against this background of lawful same-sex marriage\nin some States, the design, purpose, and effect of DOMA\nshould be considered as the beginning point in deciding\nwhether it is valid under the Constitution. By history and\ntradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will\nbe discussed in more detail, has been treated as being\nwithin the authority and realm of the separate States. Yet\nit is further established that Congress, in enacting dis-\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncrete statutes, can make determinations that bear on\nmarital rights and privileges. Just this Term the Court\nupheld the authority of the Congress to pre-empt state\nlaws, allowing a former spouse to retain life insurance\nproceeds under a federal program that gave her priority,\nbecause of formal beneficiary designation rules, over the\nwife by a second marriage who survived the husband.\nHillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___ (2013); see also Ridgway\nv. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46 (1981); Wissner v. Wissner, 338\nU. S. 655 (1950). This is one example of the general prin-\nciple that when the Federal Government acts in the exer-\ncise of its own proper authority, it has a wide choice of the\nmechanisms and means to adopt. See McCulloch v. Mary\u00ad\nland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421 (1819). Congress has the power\nboth to ensure efficiency in the administration of its pro-\ngrams and to choose what larger goals and policies to\npursue.\n   Other precedents involving congressional statutes which\naffect marriages and family status further illustrate this\npoint. In addressing the interaction of state domestic\nrelations and federal immigration law Congress deter-\nmined that marriages \u201centered into for the purpose of\nprocuring an alien\u2019s admission [to the United States] as an\nimmigrant\u201d will not qualify the noncitizen for that status,\neven if the noncitizen\u2019s marriage is valid and proper for\nstate-law purposes. 8 U. S. C. \u00a71186a(b)(1) (2006 ed. and\nSupp. V). And in establishing income-based criteria for\nSocial Security benefits, Congress decided that although\nstate law would determine in general who qualifies as an\napplicant\u2019s spouse, common-law marriages also should be\nrecognized, regardless of any particular State\u2019s view on\nthese relationships. 42 U. S. C. \u00a71382c(d)(2).\n   Though these discrete examples establish the constitu-\ntionality of limited federal laws that regulate the meaning\nof marriage in order to further federal policy, DOMA has a\nfar greater reach; for it enacts a directive applicable to\n16               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nover 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal\nregulations. And its operation is directed to a class of\npersons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States,\nhave sought to protect. See Goodridge v.

I. Laws ch. 4.\n   In order to assess the validity of that intervention it is\nnecessary to discuss the extent of the state power and au-\nthority over marriage as a matter of history and tradi-\ntion. State laws defining and regulating marriage, of\ncourse, must respect the constitutional rights of persons,\nsee, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); but, subject\nto those guarantees, \u201cregulation of domestic relations\u201d is\n\u201can area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclu-\nsive province of the States.\u201d Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n404 (1975).\n    The recognition of civil marriages is central to state\ndomestic relations law applicable to its residents and\ncitizens. See Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287,\n298 (1942) (\u201cEach state as a sovereign has a rightful and\nlegitimate concern in the marital status of persons domi-\nciled within its borders\u201d). The definition of marriage is\nthe foundation of the State\u2019s broader authority to regulate\nthe subject of domestic relations with respect to the\n\u201c[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the en-\nforcement of marital responsibilities.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[T]he states,\nat the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed\nfull power over the subject of marriage and divorce\n. . . [and] the Constitution delegated no authority to the\nGovernment of the United States on the subject of mar-\nriage and divorce.\u201d Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562,\n575 (1906); see also In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593\u2013594\n(1890) (\u201cThe whole subject of the domestic relations of\nhusband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws\nof the States and not to the laws of the United States\u201d).\n    Consistent with this allocation of authority, the Federal\nGovernment, through our history, has deferred to state-\nlaw policy decisions with respect to domestic relations. In\nDe Sylva v. Ballentine, 351 U. S. 570 (1956), for example,\nthe Court held that, \u201c[t]o decide who is the widow or wid-\nower of a deceased author, or who are his executors or\nnext of kin,\u201d under the Copyright Act \u201crequires a reference\nto the law of the State which created those legal relation-\nships\u201d because \u201cthere is no federal law of domestic rela-\ntions.\u201d Id., at 580. In order to respect this principle, the\nfederal courts, as a general rule, do not adjudicate issues\nof marital status even when there might otherwise be a\nbasis for federal jurisdiction. See Ankenbrandt v. Rich\u00ad\nards, 504 U. S. 689, 703 (1992). Federal courts will not\nhear divorce and custody cases even if they arise in diver-\nsity because of \u201cthe virtually exclusive primacy . . . of the\n18              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates in the regulation of domestic relations.\u201d Id., at 714\n(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).\n   The significance of state responsibilities for the defini-\ntion and regulation of marriage dates to the Nation\u2019s\nbeginning; for \u201cwhen the Constitution was adopted the\ncommon understanding was that the domestic relations of\nhusband and wife and parent and child were matters\nreserved to the States.\u201d Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280\nU. S. 379, 383\u2013384 (1930). Marriage laws vary in some\nrespects from State to State. For example, the required\nminimum age is 16 in Vermont, but only 13 in New\nHampshire. Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \u00a75142 (2012),\nwith N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7457:4 (West Supp. 2012).\nLikewise the permissible degree of consanguinity can vary\n(most States permit first cousins to marry, but a handful\u2014\nsuch as Iowa and Washington, see Iowa Code \u00a7595.19\n(2009); Wash. Rev. Code \u00a726.04.020 (2012)\u2014prohibit the\npractice). But these rules are in every event consistent\nwithin each State.\n   Against this background DOMA rejects the long-\nestablished precept that the incidents, benefits, and obli-\ngations of marriage are uniform for all married couples\nwithin each State, though they may vary, subject to con-\nstitutional guarantees, from one State to the next. De-\nspite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide\nwhether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation\nof the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance.\nThe State\u2019s power in defining the marital relation is of\ncentral relevance in this case quite apart from principles\nof federalism. Here the State\u2019s decision to give this class\nof persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity\nand status of immense import. When the State used its\nhistoric and essential authority to define the marital\nrelation in this way, its role and its power in making the\ndecision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection\nof the class in their own community. DOMA, because of\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nits reach and extent, departs from this history and tra-\ndition of reliance on state law to define marriage. \u201c \u2018[D]is-\ncriminations of an unusual character especially sug-\ngest careful consideration to determine whether they are\nobnoxious to the constitutional provision.\u2019 \u201d Romer v.\nEvans, 517 U. S. 620, 633 (1996) (quoting Louisville Gas &\nElec. Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37\u201338 (1928)).\n   The Federal Government uses this state-defined class\nfor the opposite purpose\u2014to impose restrictions and dis-\nabilities. That result requires this Court now to address\nwhether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation\nof an essential part of the liberty protected by the Fifth\nAmendment. What the State of New York treats as alike\nthe federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure\nthe same class the State seeks to protect.\n   In acting first to recognize and then to allow same-sex\nmarriages, New York was responding \u201cto the initiative of\nthose who [sought] a voice in shaping the destiny of their\nown times.\u201d Bond v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 9). These actions were without doubt a\nproper exercise of its sovereign authority within our fed-\neral system, all in the way that the Framers of the Constitu-\ntion intended. The dynamics of state government in the\nfederal system are to allow the formation of consensus\nrespecting the way the members of a discrete community\ntreat each other in their daily contact and constant inter-\naction with each other.\n   The States\u2019 interest in defining and regulating the\nmarital relation, subject to constitutional guarantees,\nstems from the understanding that marriage is more than\na routine classification for purposes of certain statutory\nbenefits. Private, consensual sexual intimacy between two\nadult persons of the same sex may not be punished by the\nState, and it can form \u201cbut one element in a personal bond\nthat is more enduring.\u201d Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558,\n567 (2003). By its recognition of the validity of same-sex\n20              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmarriages performed in other jurisdictions and then by\nauthorizing same-sex unions and same-sex marriages,\nNew York sought to give further protection and dignity to\nthat bond. For same-sex couples who wished to be mar-\nried, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful\nstatus. This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledg-\nment of the intimate relationship between two people, a\nrelationship deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the\ncommunity equal with all other marriages. It reflects both\nthe community\u2019s considered perspective on the historical\nroots of the institution of marriage and its evolving under-\nstanding of the meaning of equality.\n                             IV\n   DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to\nprotect. By doing so it violates basic due process and\nequal protection principles applicable to the Federal Gov-\nernment. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; Bolling v. Sharpe,\n347 U. S. 497 (1954). The Constitution\u2019s guarantee of\nequality \u201cmust at the very least mean that a bare con-\ngressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group\ncannot\u201d justify disparate treatment of that group. Depart\u00ad\nment of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 534\u2013535\n(1973). In determining whether a law is motived by an\nimproper animus or purpose, \u201c \u2018[d]iscriminations of an un-\nusual character\u2019 \u201d especially require careful considera-\ntion. Supra, at 19 (quoting Romer, supra, at 633). DOMA\ncannot survive under these principles. The responsibility\nof the States for the regulation of domestic relations is an\nimportant indicator of the substantial societal impact the\nState\u2019s classifications have in the daily lives and customs\nof its people. DOMA\u2019s unusual deviation from the usual\ntradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of\nmarriage here operates to deprive same-sex couples of the\nbenefits and responsibilities that come with the federal\nrecognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law\nhere in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate\nstatus, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex\nmarriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of\nthe States.\n  The history of DOMA\u2019s enactment and its own text\ndemonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of\nsame-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in\nthe exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an\nincidental effect of the federal statute. It was its essence.\nThe House Report announced its conclusion that \u201cit is both\nappropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can\nto defend the institution of traditional heterosexual mar-\nriage. . . . H. R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the \u2018Defense\nof Marriage Act.\u2019 The effort to redefine \u2018marriage\u2019 to ex-\ntend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that\nwould fundamentally alter the institution of marriage.\u201d\nH. R. Rep. No. 104\u2013664, pp. 12\u201313 (1996). The House\nconcluded that DOMA expresses \u201cboth moral disapproval\nof homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexu-\nality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-\nChristian) morality.\u201d Id., at 16 (footnote deleted). The\nstated purpose of the law was to promote an \u201cinterest in\nprotecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in\nheterosexual-only marriage laws.\u201d Ibid. Were there any\ndoubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act\nconfirms it: The Defense of Marriage.\n  The arguments put forward by BLAG are just as candid\nabout the congressional purpose to influence or interfere\nwith state sovereign choices about who may be married.\nAs the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its purpose is\nto discourage enactment of state same-sex marriage laws\nand to restrict the freedom and choice of couples married\nunder those laws if they are enacted. The congressional\ngoal was \u201cto put a thumb on the scales and influence a\n22              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstate\u2019s decision as to how to shape its own marriage laws.\u201d\nMassachusetts, 682 F. 3d, at 12\u201313. The Act\u2019s demon-\nstrated purpose is to ensure that if any State decides to\nrecognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated\nas second-class marriages for purposes of federal law.\nThis raises a most serious question under the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s Fifth Amendment.\n   DOMA\u2019s operation in practice confirms this purpose.\nWhen New York adopted a law to permit same-sex mar-\nriage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frus-\ntrates that objective through a system-wide enactment\nwith no identified connection to any particular area of fed-\neral law. DOMA writes inequality into the entire United\nStates Code. The particular case at hand concerns the\nestate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple determi-\nnation of what should or should not be allowed as an\nestate tax refund. Among the over 1,000 statutes and\nnumerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are\nlaws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, crimi-\nnal sanctions, copyright, and veterans\u2019 benefits.\n   DOMA\u2019s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-\nsanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The prin-\ncipal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons\nlike governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as\nrights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.\nAnd DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married\nunder the laws of their State, but not other couples, of\nboth rights and responsibilities. By creating two contra-\ndictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA\nforces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose\nof state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal\nlaw, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of\nbasic personal relations the State has found it proper to\nacknowledge and protect. By this dynamic DOMA under-\nmines both the public and private significance of state-\nsanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples,\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           23\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nand all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages\nare unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex\ncouples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier\nmarriage. The differentiation demeans the couple, whose\nmoral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see\nLawrence, 539 U. S. 558, and whose relationship the State\nhas sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands\nof children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law\nin question makes it even more difficult for the children to\nunderstand the integrity and closeness of their own family\nand its concord with other families in their community\nand in their daily lives.\n   Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their\nlives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible\nand public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many\naspects of married and family life, from the mundane to\nthe profound. It prevents same-sex married couples\nfrom obtaining government healthcare benefits they would\notherwise receive. See 5 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a78901(5), 8905. It\ndeprives them of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s special protec-\ntions for domestic-support obligations. See 11 U. S. C.\n\u00a7\u00a7101(14A), 507(a)(1)(A), 523(a)(5), 523(a)(15). It forces\nthem to follow a complicated procedure to file their state\nand federal taxes jointly. Technical Bulletin TB\u201355, 2010\nVt.

National Ceme-\ntery Administration Directive 3210/1, p. 37 (June 4, 2008).\n   For certain married couples, DOMA\u2019s unequal effects\nare even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a\ncrime to \u201cassaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] . . . a member of\nthe immediate family\u201d of \u201ca United States official, a\nUnited States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement officer,\u201d\n18 U. S. C. \u00a7115(a)(1)(A), with the intent to influence or\nretaliate against that official, \u00a7115(a)(1). Although a\n\u201cspouse\u201d qualifies as a member of the officer\u2019s \u201cimmediate\n24              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfamily,\u201d \u00a7115(c)(2), DOMA makes this protection inappli-\ncable to same-sex spouses.\n   DOMA also brings financial harm to children of same-\nsex couples. It raises the cost of health care for families\nby taxing health benefits provided by employers to their\nworkers\u2019 same-sex spouses. See 26 U. S. C. \u00a7106; Treas.\nReg. \u00a71.106\u20131, 26 CFR \u00a71.106\u20131 (2012); IRS Private Letter\nRuling 9850011 (Sept. 10, 1998). And it denies or re-\nduces benefits allowed to families upon the loss of a spouse\nand parent, benefits that are an integral part of family\nsecurity. See Social Security Administration, Social Secu-\nrity Survivors Benefits 5 (2012) (benefits available to a\nsurviving spouse caring for the couple\u2019s child), online at\nhttp://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10084.pdf.\n   DOMA divests married same-sex couples of the duties\nand responsibilities that are an essential part of married\nlife and that they in most cases would be honored to accept\nwere DOMA not in force. For instance, because it is ex-\npected that spouses will support each other as they pursue\neducational opportunities, federal law takes into consider-\nation a spouse\u2019s income in calculating a student\u2019s fed-\neral financial aid eligibility. See 20 U. S. C. \u00a71087nn(b).\nSame-sex married couples are exempt from this require-\nment. The same is true with respect to federal ethics\nrules. Federal executive and agency officials are prohibit-\ned from \u201cparticipat[ing] personally and substantially\u201d in\nmatters as to which they or their spouses have a financial\ninterest. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7208(a). A similar statute prohibits\nSenators, Senate employees, and their spouses from ac-\ncepting high-value gifts from certain sources, see 2\nU. S. C. \u00a731\u20132(a)(1), and another mandates detailed finan-\ncial disclosures by numerous high-ranking officials and\ntheir spouses. See 5 U. S. C. App. \u00a7\u00a7102(a), (e). Under\nDOMA, however, these Government-integrity rules do not\napply to same-sex spouses.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

This requires\nthe Court to hold, as it now does, that DOMA is unconsti-\ntutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person pro-\ntected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.\n   The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due\nProcess Clause contains within it the prohibition against\ndenying to any person the equal protection of the laws.\nSee Bolling, 347 U.

While the\nFifth Amendment itself withdraws from Government the\npower to degrade or demean in the way this law does,\nthe equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment makes that Fifth Amendment right all the more\nspecific and all the better understood and preserved.\n   The class to which DOMA directs its restrictions and\nrestraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex\nmarriages made lawful by the State. DOMA singles out a\nclass of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition\nand protection to enhance their own liberty. It imposes a\ndisability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status\nthe State finds to be dignified and proper. DOMA in-\nstructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with\nwhom same-sex couples interact, including their own\nchildren, that their marriage is less worthy than the mar-\nriages of others. The federal statute is invalid, for no\nlegitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to\ndisparage and to injure those whom the State, by its mar-\n26               UNITED STATES v.

On\nthe merits of the constitutional dispute the Court decides to\ndecide, I also agree with JUSTICE SCALIA that Congress\nacted constitutionally in passing the Defense of Marriage\nAct (DOMA). Interests in uniformity and stability am-\nply justified Congress\u2019s decision to retain the definition of\nmarriage that, at that point, had been adopted by every\nState in our Nation, and every nation in the world. Post,\nat 19\u201320 (dissenting opinion).\n   The majority sees a more sinister motive, pointing out\nthat the Federal Government has generally (though not\nuniformly) deferred to state definitions of marriage in the\npast. That is true, of course, but none of those prior state-\nby-state variations had involved differences over some-\nthing\u2014as the majority puts it\u2014\u201cthought of by most people\nas essential to the very definition of [marriage] and to\nits role and function throughout the history of civilization.\u201d\nAnte, at 13. That the Federal Government treated this\nfundamental question differently than it treated variations\nover consanguinity or minimum age is hardly surprising\u2014\nand hardly enough to support a conclusion that the\n\u201cprincipal purpose,\u201d ante, at 22, of the 342 Representa-\n2                UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntives and 85 Senators who voted for it, and the President\nwho signed it, was a bare desire to harm. Nor do the snip-\npets of legislative history and the banal title of the Act\nto which the majority points suffice to make such a show-\ning. At least without some more convincing evidence that\nthe Act\u2019s principal purpose was to codify malice, and that\nit furthered no legitimate government interests, I would\nnot tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry.\n   But while I disagree with the result to which the major-\nity\u2019s analysis leads it in this case, I think it more important\nto point out that its analysis leads no further. The Court\ndoes not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does\nnot decide, the distinct question whether the States, in the\nexercise of their \u201chistoric and essential authority to define\nthe marital relation,\u201d ante, at 18, may continue to utilize\nthe traditional definition of marriage.\n   The majority goes out of its way to make this explicit in\nthe penultimate sentence of its opinion. It states that\n\u201c[t]his opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful\nmarriages,\u201d ante, at 26\u2014referring to same-sex marriages\nthat a State has already recognized as a result of the local\n\u201ccommunity\u2019s considered perspective on the historical\nroots of the institution of marriage and its evolving un-\nderstanding of the meaning of equality.\u201d Ante, at 20.\nJUSTICE SCALIA believes this is a \u201c \u2018bald, unreasoned dis-\nclaime[r].\u2019 \u201d Post, at 22. In my view, though, the disclaimer\nis a logical and necessary consequence of the argument\nthe majority has chosen to adopt. The dominant theme\nof the majority opinion is that the Federal Government\u2019s\nintrusion into an area \u201ccentral to state domestic relations\nlaw applicable to its residents and citizens\u201d is sufficiently\n\u201cunusual\u201d to set off alarm bells. Ante, at 17, 20. I think\nthe majority goes off course, as I have said, but it is unde-\nniable that its judgment is based on federalism.\n   The majority extensively chronicles DOMA\u2019s departure\nfrom the normal allocation of responsibility between State\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nand Federal Governments, emphasizing that DOMA \u201cre-\njects the long-established precept that the incidents, bene-\nfits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married\ncouples within each State.\u201d Ante, at 18. But there is\nno such departure when one State adopts or keeps a defi-\nnition of marriage that differs from that of its neighbor,\nfor it is entirely expected that state definitions would\n\u201cvary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State\nto the next.\u201d Ibid. Thus, while \u201c[t]he State\u2019s power in\ndefining the marital relation is of central relevance\u201d to the\nmajority\u2019s decision to strike down DOMA here, ibid., that\npower will come into play on the other side of the board in\nfuture cases about the constitutionality of state marriage\ndefinitions. So too will the concerns for state diversity and\nsovereignty that weigh against DOMA\u2019s constitutionality\nin this case. See ante, at 19.\n   It is not just this central feature of the majority\u2019s analy-\nsis that is unique to DOMA, but many considerations on\nthe periphery as well. For example, the majority focuses\non the legislative history and title of this particular Act,\nante, at 21; those statute-specific considerations will, of\ncourse, be irrelevant in future cases about different stat-\nutes. The majority emphasizes that DOMA was a \u201csystem-\nwide enactment with no identified connection to any\nparticular area of federal law,\u201d but a State\u2019s definition of\nmarriage \u201cis the foundation of the State\u2019s broader author-\nity to regulate the subject of domestic relations with re-\nspect to the \u2018[p]rotection of offspring, property interests,\nand the enforcement of marital responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at\n22, 17. And the federal decision undermined (in the ma-\njority\u2019s view) the \u201cdignity [already] conferred by the States\nin the exercise of their sovereign power,\u201d ante, at 21,\nwhereas a State\u2019s decision whether to expand the defini-\ntion of marriage from its traditional contours involves no\nsimilar concern.\n   We may in the future have to resolve challenges to state\n4               UNITED STATES v.

It is about\nthe power of our people to govern themselves, and the\npower of this Court to pronounce the law.

And even if we did, we have no power under the\nConstitution to invalidate this democratically adopted leg-\nislation. The Court\u2019s errors on both points spring forth\nfrom the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the\nrole of this institution in America.\n                             I\n\n                             A\n\n  The Court is eager\u2014hungry\u2014to tell everyone its view of\nthe legal question at the heart of this case.

They agree that the court below got it right; and\nthey agreed in the court below that the court below that\none got it right as well. What, then, are we doing here?\n   The answer lies at the heart of the jurisdictional portion\nof today\u2019s opinion, where a single sentence lays bare the\nmajority\u2019s vision of our role. The Court says that we have\nthe power to decide this case because if we did not, then\nour \u201cprimary role in determining the constitutionality of\na law\u201d (at least one that \u201chas inflicted real injury on a\nplaintiff \u201d) would \u201cbecome only secondary to the President\u2019s.\u201d\nAnte, at 12. But wait, the reader wonders\u2014Windsor won\nbelow, and so cured her injury, and the President was glad\nto see it. True, says the majority, but judicial review must\nmarch on regardless, lest we \u201cundermine the clear dictate\nof the separation-of-powers principle that when an Act of\nCongress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, it is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks and brackets omitted).\n   That is jaw-dropping. It is an assertion of judicial su-\npremacy over the people\u2019s Representatives in Congress\nand the Executive. It envisions a Supreme Court standing\n(or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empow-\nered to decide all constitutional questions, always and every-\nwhere \u201cprimary\u201d in its role.\n   This image of the Court would have been unrecognizable\nto those who wrote and ratified our national charter.

They did it to guard their right to self-rule\nagainst the black-robed supremacy that today\u2019s majority\nfinds so attractive. So it was that Madison could confi-\ndently state, with no fear of contradiction, that there was\nnothing of \u201cgreater intrinsic value\u201d or \u201cstamped with the\nauthority of more enlightened patrons of liberty\u201d than a\ngovernment of separate and coordinate powers.

We can do so only when that allegation will\ndetermine the outcome of a lawsuit, and is contradicted by\nthe other party. The \u201cjudicial Power\u201d is not, as the major-\nity believes, the power \u201c \u2018to say what the law is,\u2019 \u201d ibid.,\ngiving the Supreme Court the \u201cprimary role in determin-\ning the constitutionality of laws.\u201d The majority must have\nin mind one of the foreign constitutions that pronounces\nsuch primacy for its constitutional court and allows that\nprimacy to be exercised in contexts other than a lawsuit.\nSee, e.g., Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany,\nArt. 93. The judicial power as Americans have understood\nit (and their English ancestors before them) is the power\nto adjudicate, with conclusive effect, disputed govern-\nment claims (civil or criminal) against private persons, and\ndisputed claims by private persons against the govern-\nment or other private persons. Sometimes (though not\nalways) the parties before the court disagree not with\nregard to the facts of their case (or not only with regard to\nthe facts) but with regard to the applicable law\u2014in which\nevent (and only in which event) it becomes the \u201c \u2018province\nand duty of the judicial department to say what the law\nis.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 12.\n   In other words, declaring the compatibility of state or\nfederal laws with the Constitution is not only not the\n\u201cprimary role\u201d of this Court, it is not a separate, free-\n4                UNITED STATES v.

Then, and only then, does it become\n\u201c \u2018the province and duty of the judicial department to say\nwhat the law is.\u2019 \u201d That is why, in 1793, we politely de-\nclined the Washington Administration\u2019s request to \u201csay\nwhat the law is\u201d on a particular treaty matter that was\nnot the subject of a concrete legal controversy. 3 Corre-\nspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486\u2013489 (H.\nJohnston ed. 1893).

Reservists Comm. to\nStop the War, 418 U. S. 208, 227 (1974); United States v.\nRichardson, 418 U. S. 166, 179 (1974).

And while, in ordi-\nnary circumstances, the United States is injured by a\ndirective to pay a tax refund, this suit is far from ordinary.\nWhatever injury the United States has suffered will surely\nnot be redressed by the action that it, as a litigant, asks us\nto take. The final sentence of the Solicitor General\u2019s brief\non the merits reads: \u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the judg-\nment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States (merits) 54 (emphasis added).

And the same was true in the Court of\nAppeals: Neither party sought to undo the judgment for\nWindsor, and so that court should have dismissed the\nappeal (just as we should dismiss) for lack of jurisdiction.\nSince both parties agreed with the judgment of the Dis-\ntrict Court for the Southern District of New York, the suit\nshould have ended there. The further proceedings have\nbeen a contrivance, having no object in mind except to ele-\nvate a District Court judgment that has no precedential\neffect in other courts, to one that has precedential effect\nthroughout the Second Circuit, and then (in this Court)\nprecedential effect throughout the United States.\n   We have never before agreed to speak\u2014to \u201csay what the\nlaw is\u201d\u2014where there is no controversy before us. In the\nmore than two centuries that this Court has existed as an\ninstitution, we have never suggested that we have the\npower to decide a question when every party agrees with\nboth its nominal opponent and the court below on that\nquestion\u2019s answer. The United States reluctantly con-\nceded that at oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\u201320.\n   The closest we have ever come to what the Court blesses\ntoday was our opinion in INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919\n(1983). But in that case, two parties to the litigation\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 For an even more advanced scavenger hunt, one might search the\n\nannals of Anglo-American law for another \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d like the\none the United States filed in District Court: It argued that the court\nshould agree \u201cwith Plaintiff and the United States\u201d and \u201cnot dismiss\u201d\nthe complaint. (Emphasis mine.) Then, having gotten exactly what it\nasked for, the United States promptly appealed.\n6                   UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                          SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n disagreed with the position of the United States and with\nthe court below: the House and Senate, which had inter-\nvened in the case. Because Chadha concerned the validity\nof a mode of congressional action\u2014the one-house legis-\nlative veto\u2014the House and Senate were threatened with\ndestruction of what they claimed to be one of their institu-\ntional powers. The Executive choosing not to defend that\npower,2 we permitted the House and Senate to intervene.\nNothing like that is present here.\n   To be sure, the Court in Chadha said that statutory\naggrieved-party status was \u201cnot altered by the fact that\nthe Executive may agree with the holding that the statute\nin question is unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 930\u2013931. But in\na footnote to that statement, the Court acknowledged Arti-\ncle III\u2019s separate requirement of a \u201cjusticiable case or\ncontroversy,\u201d and stated that this requirement was satis-\nfied \u201cbecause of the presence of the two Houses of Con-\ngress as adverse parties.\u201d Id., at 931, n. 6. Later in its\nopinion, the Chadha Court remarked that the United\nStates\u2019 announced intention to enforce the statute also\nsufficed to permit judicial review, even absent congres-\nsional participation. Id., at 939. That remark is true, as a\ndescription of the judicial review conducted in the Court of\nAppeals, where the Houses of Congress had not inter-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   2 There the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to defend the legislation\n\nwas in accord with its longstanding (and entirely reasonable) practice of\ndeclining to defend legislation that in its view infringes upon Presiden-\ntial powers. There is no justification for the Justice Department\u2019s\nabandoning the law in the present case. The majority opinion makes a\npoint of scolding the President for his \u201cfailure to defend the constitu-\ntionality of an Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet\nestablished in judicial decisions,\u201d ante, at 12. But the rebuke is tongue-\nin-cheek, for the majority gladly gives the President what he wants.\nContrary to all precedent, it decides this case (and even decides it the\nway the President wishes) despite his abandonment of the defense and\nthe consequent absence of a case or controversy.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

C. \u00a71105a(a)\n(1976 ed.).) There, absent a judgment setting aside\nthe INS order, Chadha faced deportation. This pas-\nsage of our opinion seems to be addressing that initial\nstanding in the Court of Appeals, as indicated by its quo-\ntation from the lower court\u2019s opinion, 462 U. S., at 939\u2013\n940. But if it was addressing standing to pursue the\nappeal, the remark was both the purest dictum (as con-\ngressional intervention at that point made the required\nadverseness \u201cbeyond doubt,\u201d id., at 939), and quite incor-\nrect. When a private party has a judicial decree safely in\nhand to prevent his injury, additional judicial action re-\nquires that a party injured by the decree seek to undo it.\nIn Chadha, the intervening House and Senate fulfilled\nthat requirement. Here no one does.\n   The majority\u2019s discussion of the requirements of Article\nIII bears no resemblance to our jurisprudence. It accuses\nthe amicus (appointed to argue against our jurisdiction) of\n\u201celid[ing] the distinction between . . . the jurisdictional\nrequirements of Article III and the prudential limits on its\nexercise.\u201d Ante, at 6. It then proceeds to call the require-\nment of adverseness a \u201cprudential\u201d aspect of standing. Of\nstanding. That is incomprehensible. A plaintiff (or appel-\nlant) can have all the standing in the world\u2014satisfying all\nthree standing requirements of Lujan that the majority so\ncarefully quotes, ante, at 7\u2014and yet no Article III contro-\nversy may be before the court. Article III requires not just\na plaintiff (or appellant) who has standing to complain\nbut an opposing party who denies the validity of the com-\nplaint. It is not the amicus that has done the eliding of\ndistinctions, but the majority, calling the quite separate\nArticle III requirement of adverseness between the parties\nan element (which it then pronounces a \u201cprudential\u201d ele-\nment) of standing. The question here is not whether, as\nthe majority puts it, \u201cthe United States retains a stake\n8               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient to support Article III jurisdiction,\u201d ibid. the\nquestion is whether there is any controversy (which re-\nquires contradiction) between the United States and Ms.\nWindsor. There is not.\n   I find it wryly amusing that the majority seeks to dis-\nmiss the requirement of party-adverseness as nothing\nmore than a \u201cprudential\u201d aspect of the sole Article III\nrequirement of standing. (Relegating a jurisdictional re-\nquirement to \u201cprudential\u201d status is a wondrous device,\nenabling courts to ignore the requirement whenever they\nbelieve it \u201cprudent\u201d\u2014which is to say, a good idea.) Half a\ncentury ago, a Court similarly bent upon announcing its\nview regarding the constitutionality of a federal statute\nachieved that goal by effecting a remarkably similar but\ncompletely opposite distortion of the principles limiting our\njurisdiction. The Court\u2019s notorious opinion in Flast v.\nCohen, 392 U. S. 83, 98\u2013101 (1968), held that standing\nwas merely an element (which it pronounced to be a\n\u201cprudential\u201d element) of the sole Article III requirement\nof adverseness. We have been living with the chaos created\nby that power-grabbing decision ever since, see Hein v.\nFreedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., 551 U. S. 587\n(2007), as we will have to live with the chaos created by\nthis one.\n   The authorities the majority cites fall miles short of\nsupporting the counterintuitive notion that an Article III\n\u201ccontroversy\u201d can exist without disagreement between the\nparties. In Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445\nU. S. 326 (1980), the District Court had entered judgment\nin the individual plaintiff \u2019s favor based on the defendant\nbank\u2019s offer to pay the full amount claimed. The plaintiff,\nhowever, sought to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of\nclass certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23. There was a continuing dispute between the parties\nconcerning the issue raised on appeal. The same is true of\nthe other case cited by the majority, Camreta v. Greene,\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\n563 U. S. ___ (2011). There the District Court found that\nthe defendant state officers had violated the Fourth\nAmendment, but rendered judgment in their favor because\nthey were entitled to official immunity, application of the\nFourth Amendment to their conduct not having been clear\nat the time of violation. The officers sought to appeal\nthe holding of Fourth Amendment violation, which would\ncircumscribe their future conduct; the plaintiff continued\nto insist that a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred.\nThe \u201cprudential\u201d discretion to which both those cases refer\nwas the discretion to deny an appeal even when a live\ncontroversy exists\u2014not the discretion to grant one when it\ndoes not. The majority can cite no case in which this\nCourt entertained an appeal in which both parties urged\nus to affirm the judgment below. And that is because the\nexistence of a controversy is not a \u201cprudential\u201d require-\nment that we have invented, but an essential element of\nan Article III case or controversy. The majority\u2019s notion\nthat a case between friendly parties can be entertained so\nlong as \u201cadversarial presentation of the issues is assured\nby the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend\nwith vigor\u201d the other side of the issue, ante, at 10, effects a\nbreathtaking revolution in our Article III jurisprudence.\n   It may be argued that if what we say is true some Presi-\ndential determinations that statutes are unconstitutional\nwill not be subject to our review. That is as it should\nbe, when both the President and the plaintiff agree that\nthe statute is unconstitutional. Where the Executive is en-\nforcing an unconstitutional law, suit will of course lie; but\nif, in that suit, the Executive admits the unconstitution-\nality of the law, the litigation should end in an order or a\nconsent decree enjoining enforcement. This suit saw the\nlight of day only because the President enforced the Act\n(and thus gave Windsor standing to sue) even though he\nbelieved it unconstitutional. He could have equally chosen\n(more appropriately, some would say) neither to enforce\n10              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nnor to defend the statute he believed to be unconstitu-\ntional, see Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute Un-\nconstitutional Statutes, 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 199\n(Nov. 2, 1994)\u2014in which event Windsor would not have\nbeen injured, the District Court could not have refereed\nthis friendly scrimmage, and the Executive\u2019s determina-\ntion of unconstitutionality would have escaped this Court\u2019s\ndesire to blurt out its view of the law. The matter would\nhave been left, as so many matters ought to be left, to a\ntug of war between the President and the Congress, which\nhas innumerable means (up to and including impeach-\nment) of compelling the President to enforce the laws it\nhas written. Or the President could have evaded presen-\ntation of the constitutional issue to this Court simply by\ndeclining to appeal the District Court and Court of Ap-\npeals dispositions he agreed with. Be sure of this much: If\na President wants to insulate his judgment of unconstitu-\ntionality from our review, he can. What the views urged\nin this dissent produce is not insulation from judicial\nreview but insulation from Executive contrivance.\n   The majority brandishes the famous sentence from\nMarbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803) that \u201c[i]t is\nemphatically the province and duty of the judicial depart-\nment to say what the law is.\u201d Ante, at 12 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). But that sentence neither says nor\nimplies that it is always the province and duty of the\nCourt to say what the law is\u2014much less that its responsi-\nbility in that regard is a \u201cprimary\u201d one. The very next\nsentence of Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion makes the\ncrucial qualification that today\u2019s majority ignores: \u201cThose\nwho apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity\nexpound and interpret that rule.\u201d 1 Cranch, at 177 (em-\nphasis added). Only when a \u201cparticular case\u201d is before\nus\u2014that is, a controversy that it is our business to resolve\nunder Article III\u2014do we have the province and duty to\npronounce the law.

Mansfield\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 JUSTICE ALITO attempts to limit his argument by claiming that Con-\ngress is injured (and can therefore appeal) when its statute is held\nunconstitutional without Presidential defense, but is not injured when\nits statute is held unconstitutional despite Presidential defense. I do\nnot understand that line. The injury to Congress is the same whether\nthe President has defended the statute or not. And if the injury is\nthreatened, why should Congress not be able to participate in the suit\nfrom the beginning, just as the President can? And if having a statute\ndeclared unconstitutional (and therefore inoperative) by a court is an\ninjury, why is it not an injury when a statute is declared unconstitu-\ntional by the President and rendered inoperative by his consequent\nfailure to enforce it? Or when the President simply declines to enforce\nit without opining on its constitutionality? If it is the inoperativeness\nthat constitutes the injury\u2014the \u201cimpairment of [the legislative] func-\ntion,\u201d as JUSTICE ALITO puts it, post, at 4\u2014it should make no difference\nwhich of the other two branches inflicts it, and whether the Constitu-\ntion is the pretext. A principled and predictable system of jurispru-\ndence cannot rest upon a shifting concept of injury, designed to support\nstanding when we would like it. If this Court agreed with JUSTICE\nALITO\u2019s distinction, its opinion in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811 (1997),\nwhich involved an original suit by Members of Congress challenging an\nassertedly unconstitutional law, would have been written quite differ-\nently; and JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s distinguishing of that case on grounds quite\nirrelevant to his theory of standing would have been unnecessary.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

That would be replaced by a\nsystem in which Congress and the Executive can pop\nimmediately into court, in their institutional capacity,\nwhenever the President refuses to implement a statute he\nbelieves to be unconstitutional, and whenever he imple-\nments a law in a manner that is not to Congress\u2019s liking.\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s notion of standing will likewise enor-\nmously shrink the area to which \u201cjudicial censure, exer-\ncised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend,\u201d ibid.\nFor example, a bare majority of both Houses could bring\ninto court the assertion that the Executive\u2019s implementa-\ntion of welfare programs is too generous\u2014a failure that no\nother litigant would have standing to complain about.\nMoreover, as we indicated in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S.\n811, 828 (1997), if Congress can sue the Executive for the\nerroneous application of the law that \u201cinjures\u201d its power to\nlegislate, surely the Executive can sue Congress for its\nerroneous adoption of an unconstitutional law that \u201cin-\njures\u201d the Executive\u2019s power to administer\u2014or perhaps for\nits protracted failure to act on one of his nominations. The\nopportunities for dragging the courts into disputes hith-\nerto left for political resolution are endless.\n   JUSTICE ALITO\u2019s dissent is correct that Raines did not\nformally decide this issue, but its reasoning does. The\nopinion spends three pages discussing famous, decades-\nlong disputes between the President and Congress\u2014\nregarding congressional power to forbid the Presidential\nremoval of executive officers, regarding the legislative\nveto, regarding congressional appointment of executive\nofficers, and regarding the pocket veto\u2014that would\nsurely have been promptly resolved by a Congress-vs.-the-\nPresident lawsuit if the impairment of a branch\u2019s powers\nalone conferred standing to commence litigation. But it\ndoes not, and never has; the \u201cenormous power that the\njudiciary would acquire\u201d from the ability to adjudicate\nsuch suits \u201cwould have made a mockery of [Hamilton\u2019s]\n14              UNITED STATES v.

Kline, 759 F. 2d 21, 58 (CADC 1985)\n(Bork, J., dissenting) (quoting The Federalist No. 78 (A.\nHamilton)).\n  To be sure, if Congress cannot invoke our authority in\nthe way that JUSTICE ALITO proposes, then its only re-\ncourse is to confront the President directly.

If\nmajorities in both Houses of Congress care enough about\nthe matter, they have available innumerable ways to com-\npel executive action without a lawsuit\u2014from refusing\nto confirm Presidential appointees to the elimination of\nfunding. (Nothing says \u201cenforce the Act\u201d quite like \u201c. . . or\nyou will have money for little else.\u201d) But the condition is\ncrucial; Congress must care enough to act against the\nPresident itself, not merely enough to instruct its lawyers\nto ask us to do so. Placing the Constitution\u2019s entirely\nanticipated political arm wrestling into permanent judicial\nreceivership does not do the system a favor. And by the\nway, if the President loses the lawsuit but does not faith-\nfully implement the Court\u2019s decree, just as he did not\nfaithfully implement Congress\u2019s statute, what then?

The first is how rootless and shifting its\njustifications are. For example, the opinion starts with\nseven full pages about the traditional power of States to\ndefine domestic relations\u2014initially fooling many readers,\nI am sure, into thinking that this is a federalism opinion.\nBut we are eventually told that \u201cit is unnecessary to de-\ncide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a vio-\nlation of the Constitution,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s power\nin defining the marital relation is of central relevance\nin this case quite apart from principles of federalism\u201d be-\ncause \u201cthe State\u2019s decision to give this class of persons\nthe right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and\nstatus of immense import.\u201d Ante, at 18. But no one ques-\ntions the power of the States to define marriage (with the\nconcomitant conferral of dignity and status), so what is the\npoint of devoting seven pages to describing how long and\nwell established that power is? Even after the opinion has\nformally disclaimed reliance upon principles of federalism,\nmentions of \u201cthe usual tradition of recognizing and accept-\ning state definitions of marriage\u201d continue. See, e.g., ante,\nat 20. What to make of this? The opinion never explains.\nMy guess is that the majority, while reluctant to suggest\nthat defining the meaning of \u201cmarriage\u201d in federal stat-\nutes is unsupported by any of the Federal Government\u2019s\nenumerated powers,4 nonetheless needs some rhetorical\nbasis to support its pretense that today\u2019s prohibition of\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Such a suggestion would be impossible, given the Federal Govern-\n\nment\u2019s long history of making pronouncements regarding marriage\u2014for\nexample, conditioning Utah\u2019s entry into the Union upon its prohibition\nof polygamy.

But I am only guessing.\n   Equally perplexing are the opinion\u2019s references to \u201cthe\nConstitution\u2019s guarantee of equality.\u201d Ibid. Near the end\nof the opinion, we are told that although the \u201cequal protec-\ntion guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment makes [the]\nFifth Amendment [due process] right all the more specific\nand all the better understood and preserved\u201d\u2014what can\nthat mean?\u2014\u201cthe Fifth Amendment itself withdraws from\nGovernment the power to degrade or demean in the way\nthis law does.\u201d Ante, at 25. The only possible interpreta-\ntion of this statement is that the Equal Protection Clause,\neven the Equal Protection Clause as incorporated in the\nDue Process Clause, is not the basis for today\u2019s holding.\nBut the portion of the majority opinion that explains why\nDOMA is unconstitutional (Part IV) begins by citing Bol-\nling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), Department of Agri-\nculture v. Moreno, 413 U. S. 528 (1973), and Romer v.\nEvans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996)\u2014all of which are equal-\nprotection cases.5 And those three cases are the only\nauthorities that the Court cites in Part IV about the Con-\nstitution\u2019s meaning, except for its citation of Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (not an equal-protection case)\nto support its passing assertion that the Constitution\nprotects the \u201cmoral and sexual choices\u201d of same-sex cou-\nples, ante, at 23.\n   Moreover, if this is meant to be an equal-protection\nopinion, it is a confusing one. The opinion does not resolve\nand indeed does not even mention what had been the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Since the Equal Protection Clause technically applies only against\n\nthe States, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, Bolling and Moreno, dealing\nwith federal action, relied upon \u201cthe equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Moreno, 413 U. S., at\n533.\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             17\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\ncentral question in this litigation: whether, under the\nEqual Protection Clause, laws restricting marriage to a\nman and a woman are reviewed for more than mere ra-\ntionality. That is the issue that divided the parties and\nthe court below, compare Brief for Respondent Bipartisan\nLegal Advisory Group of U. S. House of Representatives\n(merits) 24\u201328 (no), with Brief for Respondent Windsor\n(merits) 17\u201331 and Brief for United States (merits) 18\u201336\n(yes); and compare 699 F. 3d 169, 180\u2013185 (CA2 2012)\n(yes), with id., at 208\u2013211 (Straub, J., dissenting in part\nand concurring in part) (no). In accord with my previously\nexpressed skepticism about the Court\u2019s \u201ctiers of scrutiny\u201d\napproach, I would review this classification only for its\nrationality. See United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515,\n567\u2013570 (1996) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). As nearly as I can\ntell, the Court agrees with that; its opinion does not apply\nstrict scrutiny, and its central propositions are taken from\nrational-basis cases like Moreno. But the Court certainly\ndoes not apply anything that resembles that deferential\nframework. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 320 (1993)\n(a classification \u201c\u2018must be upheld . . . if there is any reason-\nably conceivable state of facts\u2019 \u201d that could justify it).\n   The majority opinion need not get into the strict-vs.-\nrational-basis scrutiny question, and need not justify its\nholding under either, because it says that DOMA is un-\nconstitutional as \u201ca deprivation of the liberty of the person\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution,\u201d\nante, at 25; that it violates \u201cbasic due process\u201d principles,\nante, at 20; and that it inflicts an \u201cinjury and indignity\u201d of\na kind that denies \u201can essential part of the liberty pro-\ntected by the Fifth Amendment,\u201d ante, at 19. The majority\nnever utters the dread words \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d\nperhaps sensing the disrepute into which that doctrine\nhas fallen, but that is what those statements mean. Yet\nthe opinion does not argue that same-sex marriage is\n\u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d\n18               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720\u2013721\n(1997), a claim that would of course be quite absurd. So\nwould the further suggestion (also necessary, under our\nsubstantive-due-process precedents) that a world in which\nDOMA exists is one bereft of \u201c \u2018ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 721\n(quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937)).\n  Some might conclude that this loaf could have used a\nwhile longer in the oven. But that would be wrong; it is\nalready overcooked. The most expert care in preparation\ncannot redeem a bad recipe. The sum of all the Court\u2019s\nnonspecific hand-waving is that this law is invalid (maybe\non equal-protection grounds, maybe on substantive-due-\nprocess grounds, and perhaps with some amorphous fed-\neralism component playing a role) because it is motivated\nby a \u201c \u2018bare . . . desire to harm\u2019 \u201d couples in same-sex mar-\nriages. Ante, at 20. It is this proposition with which I will\ntherefore engage.\n                             B\n  As I have observed before, the Constitution does not\nforbid the government to enforce traditional moral and\nsexual norms. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 599\n(2003) (SCALIA, J., dissenting). I will not swell the U. S.\nReports with restatements of that point. It is enough to\nsay that the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our\nsociety to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it nei-\nther requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce,\npolygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.\n  However, even setting aside traditional moral disap-\nproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex),\nthere are many perfectly valid\u2014indeed, downright bor-\ning\u2014justifying rationales for this legislation. Their exist-\nence ought to be the end of this case. For they give the lie\nto the Court\u2019s conclusion that only those with hateful\nhearts could have voted \u201caye\u201d on this Act. And more\nimportantly, they serve to make the contents of the legis-\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

O\u2019Brien, 391\nU. S. 367, 383 (1968). Or at least it was a familiar princi-\nple. By holding to the contrary, the majority has declared\nopen season on any law that (in the opinion of the law\u2019s\nopponents and any panel of like-minded federal judges)\ncan be characterized as mean-spirited.\n   The majority concludes that the only motive for this Act\nwas the \u201cbare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular\ngroup.\u201d Ante, at 20. Bear in mind that the object of\nthis condemnation is not the legislature of some once-\nConfederate Southern state (familiar objects of the Court\u2019s\nscorn, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578\n(1987)), but our respected coordinate branches, the Con-\ngress and Presidency of the United States. Laying such a\ncharge against them should require the most extraordi-\nnary evidence, and I would have thought that every\nattempt would be made to indulge a more anodyne expla-\nnation for the statute. The majority does the opposite\u2014\naffirmatively concealing from the reader the arguments\nthat exist in justification. It makes only a passing men-\ntion of the \u201carguments put forward\u201d by the Act\u2019s defenders,\nand does not even trouble to paraphrase or describe them.\nSee ante, at 21. I imagine that this is because it is harder\nto maintain the illusion of the Act\u2019s supporters as unhinged\nmembers of a wild-eyed lynch mob when one first describes\ntheir views as they see them.\n   To choose just one of these defenders\u2019 arguments,\nDOMA avoids difficult choice-of-law issues that will now\narise absent a uniform federal definition of marriage. See,\ne.g., Baude, Beyond DOMA: Choice of State Law in Fed-\neral Statutes, 64 Stan. L. Rev. 1371 (2012). Imagine a pair\nof women who marry in Albany and then move to Ala-\nbama, which does not \u201crecognize as valid any marriage of\n20              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                    SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nparties of the same sex.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a730\u20131\u201319(e) (2011).\nWhen the couple files their next federal tax return, may it\nbe a joint one? Which State\u2019s law controls, for federal-law\npurposes: their State of celebration (which recognizes the\nmarriage) or their State of domicile (which does not)?\n(Does the answer depend on whether they were just visit-\ning in Albany?) Are these questions to be answered as a\nmatter of federal common law, or perhaps by borrowing a\nState\u2019s choice-of-law rules? If so, which State\u2019s? And what\nabout States where the status of an out-of-state same-sex\nmarriage is an unsettled question under local law? See\nGodfrey v. Spano, 13 N. Y. 3d 358, 920 N. E. 2d 328\n(2009). DOMA avoided all of this uncertainty by speci-\nfying which marriages would be recognized for federal\npurposes. That is a classic purpose for a definitional\nprovision.\n   Further, DOMA preserves the intended effects of prior\nlegislation against then-unforeseen changes in circum-\nstance. When Congress provided (for example) that a\nspecial estate-tax exemption would exist for spouses, this\nexemption reached only opposite-sex spouses\u2014those being\nthe only sort that were recognized in any State at the time\nof DOMA\u2019s passage. When it became clear that changes in\nstate law might one day alter that balance, DOMA\u2019s defi-\nnitional section was enacted to ensure that state-level\nexperimentation did not automatically alter the basic\noperation of federal law, unless and until Congress made\nthe further judgment to do so on its own. That is not\nanimus\u2014just stabilizing prudence. Congress has hardly\ndemonstrated itself unwilling to make such further, revis-\ning judgments upon due deliberation. See, e.g., Don\u2019t Ask,\nDon\u2019t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, 124 Stat. 3515.\n   The Court mentions none of this. Instead, it accuses the\nCongress that enacted this law and the President who\nsigned it of something much worse than, for example,\nhaving acted in excess of enumerated federal powers\u2014or\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           21\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\neven having drawn distinctions that prove to be irrational.\nThose legal errors may be made in good faith, errors\nthough they are. But the majority says that the support-\ners of this Act acted with malice\u2014with the \u201cpurpose\u201d (ante,\nat 25) \u201cto disparage and to injure\u201d same-sex couples. It\nsays that the motivation for DOMA was to \u201cdemean,\u201d\nibid.; to \u201cimpose inequality,\u201d ante, at 22; to \u201cimpose . . . a\nstigma,\u201d ante, at 21; to deny people \u201cequal dignity,\u201d ibid.;\nto brand gay people as \u201cunworthy,\u201d ante, at 23; and to\n\u201chumiliat[e]\u201d their children, ibid. (emphasis added).\n   I am sure these accusations are quite untrue. To be\nsure (as the majority points out), the legislation is called\nthe Defense of Marriage Act. But to defend traditional\nmarriage is not to condemn, demean, or humiliate those\nwho would prefer other arrangements, any more than to\ndefend the Constitution of the United States is to con-\ndemn, demean, or humiliate other constitutions. To hurl\nsuch accusations so casually demeans this institution. In\nthe majority\u2019s judgment, any resistance to its holding is\nbeyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its\nhigh-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute\nis to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to \u201cdis-\nparage,\u201d \u201dinjure,\u201d \u201cdegrade,\u201d \u201ddemean,\u201d and \u201chumiliate\u201d our\nfellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homo-\nsexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did\nno more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been\nunquestioned in our society for most of its existence\u2014\nindeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for\nvirtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society\nto elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose\nchange by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani\ngeneris, enemies of the human race.\n                      *      *    *\n  The penultimate sentence of the majority\u2019s opinion is a\nnaked declaration that \u201c[t]his opinion and its holding are\n22               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                      SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nconfined\u201d to those couples \u201cjoined in same-sex marriages\nmade lawful by the State.\u201d Ante, at 26, 25. I have heard\nsuch \u201cbald, unreasoned disclaimer[s]\u201d before. Lawrence,\n539 U. S., at 604. When the Court declared a constitu-\ntional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured that\nthe case had nothing, nothing at all to do with \u201cwhether\nthe government must give formal recognition to any rela-\ntionship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\u201d Id., at\n578. Now we are told that DOMA is invalid because it\n\u201cdemeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the\nConstitution protects,\u201d ante, at 23\u2014with an accompanying\ncitation of Lawrence. It takes real cheek for today\u2019s major-\nity to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitu-\ntional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex\nmarriage is not at issue here\u2014when what has preceded\nthat assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority\u2019s\nmoral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the\nCongress\u2019s hateful moral judgment against it. I promise\nyou this: The only thing that will \u201cconfine\u201d the Court\u2019s\nholding is its sense of what it can get away with.\n   I do not mean to suggest disagreement with THE CHIEF\nJUSTICE\u2019s view, ante, p. 2\u20134 (dissenting opinion), that\nlower federal courts and state courts can distinguish\ntoday\u2019s case when the issue before them is state denial\nof marital status to same-sex couples\u2014or even that this\nCourt could theoretically do so. Lord, an opinion with such\nscatter-shot rationales as this one (federalism noises\namong them) can be distinguished in many ways. And\ndeserves to be. State and lower federal courts should take\nthe Court at its word and distinguish away.\n   In my opinion, however, the view that this Court will\ntake of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated\nbeyond mistaking by today\u2019s opinion. As I have said, the\nreal rationale of today\u2019s opinion, whatever disappearing\ntrail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to follow, is\nthat DOMA is motivated by \u201c \u2018bare . . . desire to harm\u2019 \u201d\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

How easy it\nis, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion\nwith regard to state laws denying same-sex couples mari-\ntal status. Consider how easy (inevitable) it is to make the\nfollowing substitutions in a passage from today\u2019s opinion\nante, at 22:\n    \u201cDOMA\u2019s This state law\u2019s principal effect is to identify\n    a subset of state-sanctioned marriages constitution-\n    ally protected sexual relationships, see Lawrence, and\n    make them unequal. The principal purpose is to im-\n    pose inequality, not for other reasons like govern-\n    mental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as rights,\n    enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And\n    DOMA this state law contrives to deprive some cou-\n    ples married under the laws of their State enjoying\n    constitutionally protected sexual relationships, but not\n    other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.\u201d\nOr try this passage, from ante, at 22\u201323:\n    \u201c[DOMA] This state law tells those couples, and all\n    the world, that their otherwise valid marriages rela-\n    tionships are unworthy of federal state recognition.\n    This places same-sex couples in an unstable position\n    of being in a second-tier marriage relationship. The\n    differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral\n    and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see\n    Lawrence, . . . .\u201d\nOr this, from ante, at 23\u2014which does not even require\nalteration, except as to the invented number:\n    \u201cAnd it humiliates tens of thousands of children now\n    being raised by same-sex couples. The law in question\n    makes it even more difficult for the children to under-\n    stand the integrity and closeness of their own family\n    and its concord with other families in their commu-\n    nity and in their daily lives.\u201d\n24               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     SCALIA, J., dissenting\n\nSimilarly transposable passages\u2014deliberately transpos-\nable, I think\u2014abound. In sum, that Court which finds it\nso horrific that Congress irrationally and hatefully robbed\nsame-sex couples of the \u201cpersonhood and dignity\u201d which\nstate legislatures conferred upon them, will of a certitude\nbe similarly appalled by state legislatures\u2019 irrational and\nhateful failure to acknowledge that \u201cpersonhood and dig-\nnity\u201d in the first place. Ante, at 26. As far as this Court is\nconcerned, no one should be fooled; it is just a matter of\nlistening and waiting for the other shoe.\n    By formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex\nmarriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms\nwell every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to\nits traditional definition. Henceforth those challengers\nwill lead with this Court\u2019s declaration that there is \u201cno\nlegitimate purpose\u201d served by such a law, and will claim\nthat the traditional definition has \u201cthe purpose and effect\nto disparage and to injure\u201d the \u201cpersonhood and dignity\u201d\nof same-sex couples, see ante, at 25, 26. The majority\u2019s\nlimiting assurance will be meaningless in the face of lan-\nguage like that, as the majority well knows. That is why\nthe language is there. The result will be a judicial distor-\ntion of our society\u2019s debate over marriage\u2014a debate that\ncan seem in need of our clumsy \u201chelp\u201d only to a member of\nthis institution.\n   As to that debate: Few public controversies touch an\ninstitution so central to the lives of so many, and few\ninspire such attendant passion by good people on all sides.\nFew public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly\nthe beauty of what our Framers gave us, a gift the Court\npawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a\nsystem of government that permits us to rule ourselves.\nSince DOMA\u2019s passage, citizens on all sides of the question\nhave seen victories and they have seen defeats. There\nhave been plebiscites, legislation, persuasion, and loud\nvoices\u2014in other words, democracy. Victories in one place\n                    Cite as: 570 U.

That debate is, at bottom, about the nature\nof the institution of marriage. Respondent Edith Windsor,\nsupported by the United States, asks this Court to inter-\nvene in that debate, and although she couches her argu-\nment in different terms, what she seeks is a holding that\nenshrines in the Constitution a particular understanding\nof marriage under which the sex of the partners makes\nno difference. The Constitution, however, does not dictate\nthat choice. It leaves the choice to the people, acting\nthrough their elected representatives at both the federal\nand state levels. I would therefore hold that Congress did\nnot violate Windsor\u2019s constitutional rights by enacting \u00a73\nof the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 110 Stat. 2419,\nwhich defines the meaning of marriage under federal\nstatutes that either confer upon married persons cer-\ntain federal benefits or impose upon them certain federal\nobligations.\n                              I\n  I turn first to the question of standing. In my view, the\n2                  UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nUnited States clearly is not a proper petitioner in this\ncase. The United States does not ask us to overturn the\njudgment of the court below or to alter that judgment in\nany way. Quite to the contrary, the United States argues\nemphatically in favor of the correctness of that judgment.\nWe have never before reviewed a decision at the sole\nbehest of a party that took such a position, and to do so\nwould be to render an advisory opinion, in violation of\nArticle III\u2019s dictates. For the reasons given in JUSTICE\nSCALIA\u2019s dissent, I do not find the Court\u2019s arguments to\nthe contrary to be persuasive.\n   Whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the\nHouse of Representatives (BLAG) has standing to\npetition is a much more difficult question. It is also a signifi-\ncantly closer question than whether the intervenors in Hol\u00ad\nlingsworth v. Perry, ante, p. ___ \u2014which the Court also\ndecides today\u2014have standing to appeal. It is remarkable\nthat the Court has simultaneously decided that the United\nStates, which \u201creceive[d] all that [it] ha[d] sought\u201d below,\nDeposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, 445 U. S. 326, 333\n(1980), is a proper petitioner in this case but that the\nintervenors in Hollingsworth, who represent the party\nthat lost in the lower court, are not. In my view, both the\nHollingsworth intervenors and BLAG have standing.1\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Our precedents make clear that, in order to support our jurisdic-\n\ntion, BLAG must demonstrate that it had Article III standing in its own\nright, quite apart from its status as an intervenor. See Diamond v.\nCharles, 476 U. S. 54, 68 (1986) (\u201cAlthough intervenors are considered\nparties entitled, among other things, to seek review by this Court, an\nintervenor\u2019s right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on\nwhose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a showing by\nthe intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of Art.

Greene, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5)\n(quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,\n560\u2013561 (1992)). In the present case, the House of Repre-\nsentatives, which has authorized BLAG to represent its\ninterests in this matter,2 suffered just such an injury.\n   In INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919 (1983), the Court held\nthat the two Houses of Congress were \u201cproper parties\u201d to\nfile a petition in defense of the constitutionality of the\none-house veto statute, id., at 930, n. 5 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court granted and\ndecided petitions by both the Senate and the House, in\naddition to the Executive\u2019s petition. Id., at 919, n. *. That\nthe two Houses had standing to petition is not surprising:\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Chadha, by holding the\none-house veto to be unconstitutional, had limited Con-\ngress\u2019 power to legislate. In discussing Article III stand-\ning, the Court suggested that Congress suffered a similar\ninjury whenever federal legislation it had passed was\nstruck down, noting that it had \u201clong held that Congress is\nthe proper party to defend the validity of a statute when\nan agency of government, as a defendant charged with\nenforcing the statute, agrees with plaintiffs that the stat-\nute is inapplicable or unconstitutional.\u201d Id., at 940.\n   The United States attempts to distinguish Chadha on\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nat 65 (\u201cAn intervenor cannot step into the shoes of the original party\nunless the intervenor independently fulfills the requirements of Article\nIII\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  2 H. Res. 5, 113th Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a74(a)(1)(B) (2013) (\u201c[BLAG] con-\n\ntinues to speak for, and articulates the institutional position of, the\nHouse in all litigation matters in which it appears, including in Wind-\nsor v. United States\u201d).\n4               UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nthe ground that it \u201cinvolved an unusual statute that vested\nthe House and the Senate themselves each with special\nprocedural rights\u2014namely, the right effectively to veto\nExecutive action.\u201d Brief for United States (jurisdiction)\n36. But that is a distinction without a difference: just as\nthe Court of Appeals decision that the Chadha Court\naffirmed impaired Congress\u2019 power by striking down the\none-house veto, so the Second Circuit\u2019s decision here im-\npairs Congress\u2019 legislative power by striking down an Act\nof Congress. The United States has not explained why the\nfact that the impairment at issue in Chadha was \u201cspecial\u201d\nor \u201cprocedural\u201d has any relevance to whether Congress\nsuffered an injury. Indeed, because legislating is Con-\ngress\u2019 central function, any impairment of that function is\na more grievous injury than the impairment of a proce-\ndural add-on.\n   The Court\u2019s decision in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433\n(1939), bolsters this conclusion. In Coleman, we held that\na group of state senators had standing to challenge a lower\ncourt decision approving the procedures used to ratify\nan amendment to the Federal Constitution. We reasoned\nthat the senators\u2019 votes\u2014which would otherwise have\ncarried the day\u2014were nullified by that action. See id., at\n438 (\u201cHere, the plaintiffs include twenty senators, whose\nvotes against ratification have been overridden and virtu-\nally held for naught although if they are right in their\ncontentions their votes would have been sufficient to\ndefeat ratification. We think that these senators have a\nplain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the ef-\nfectiveness of their votes\u201d); id., at 446 (\u201c[W]e find no\ndeparture from principle in recognizing in the instant\ncase that at least the twenty senators whose votes, if their\ncontention were sustained, would have been sufficient to\ndefeat the resolution ratifying the proposed constitutional\namendment, have an interest in the controversy which,\ntreated by the state court as a basis for entertaining and\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

By striking\ndown \u00a73 of DOMA as unconstitutional, the Second Circuit\neffectively \u201cheld for naught\u201d an Act of Congress. Just as\nthe state-senator-petitioners in Coleman were necessary\nparties to the amendment\u2019s ratification, the House of\nRepresentatives was a necessary party to DOMA\u2019s pas-\nsage; indeed, the House\u2019s vote would have been sufficient\nto prevent DOMA\u2019s repeal if the Court had not chosen to\nexecute that repeal judicially.\n  Both the United States and the Court-appointed amicus\nerr in arguing that Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811 (1997), is\nto the contrary. In that case, the Court held that Mem-\nbers of Congress who had voted \u201cnay\u201d to the Line Item\nVeto Act did not have standing to challenge that statute\nin federal court. Raines is inapposite for two reasons.\nFirst, Raines dealt with individual Members of Congress\nand specifically pointed to the individual Members\u2019 lack\nof institutional endorsement as a sign of their standing\nproblem: \u201cWe attach some importance to the fact that\nappellees have not been authorized to represent their\nrespective Houses of Congress in this action, and indeed\nboth Houses actively oppose their suit.\u201d Id., at 829; see\nalso ibid., n. 10 (citing cases to the effect that \u201cmembers of\ncollegial bodies do not have standing to perfect an appeal\nthe body itself has declined to take\u201d (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n  Second, the Members in Raines\u2014unlike the state sena-\ntors in Coleman\u2014were not the pivotal figures whose votes\nwould have caused the Act to fail absent some challenged\naction. Indeed, it is telling that Raines characterized\nColeman as standing \u201cfor the proposition that legislators\nwhose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact)\na specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legis-\nlative action goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on\nthe ground that their votes have been completely nulli-\n6                 UNITED STATES v.

I, \u00a77 (bicameralism and presentment requirements for\nlegislation).\n   I appreciate the argument that the Constitution confers\non the President alone the authority to defend federal law\nin litigation, but in my view, as I have explained, that\nargument is contrary to the Court\u2019s holding in Chadha,\nand it is certainly contrary to the Chadha Court\u2019s en-\ndorsement of the principle that \u201cCongress is the proper\nparty to defend the validity of a statute\u201d when the Execu-\ntive refuses to do so on constitutional grounds. 462 U. S.,\nat 940. See also 2 U. S. C. \u00a7288h(7) (Senate Legal Counsel\nshall defend the constitutionality of Acts of Congress when\nplaced in issue).3 Accordingly, in the narrow category of\ncases in which a court strikes down an Act of Congress\nand the Executive declines to defend the Act, Congress\nboth has standing to defend the undefended statute and is\na proper party to do so.\n                             II\n   Windsor and the United States argue that \u00a73 of DOMA\nviolates the equal protection principles that the Court has\nfound in the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. See\nBrief for Respondent Windsor (merits) 17\u201362; Brief for\nUnited States (merits) 16\u201354; cf. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347\nU. S. 497 (1954). The Court rests its holding on related\narguments.

And the\nCourt\u2019s holding that \u201cDOMA is unconstitutional as a dep-\nrivation of the liberty of the person protected by the\nFifth Amendment of the Constitution,\u201d ante, at 25, sug-\ngests that substantive due process may partially underlie\nthe Court\u2019s decision today.       But it is well established\nthat any \u201csubstantive\u201d component to the Due Process\nClause protects only \u201cthose fundamental rights and lib-\nerties which are, objectively, \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s\nhistory and tradition,\u2019 \u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 720\u2013721 (1997); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291\nU. S. 97, 105 (1934) (referring to fundamental rights as\nthose that are so \u201crooted in the traditions and conscience\nof our people as to be ranked as fundamental\u201d), as well as\n\u201c \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u2019 such that\n\u2018neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacri-\nficed.\u2019 \u201d Glucksberg, supra, at 721 (quoting Palko v. Con\u00ad\nnecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325\u2013326 (1937)).\n    It is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage\nis not deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\nIn this country, no State permitted same-sex marriage\nuntil the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held in\n2003 that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated\nthe State Constitution. See Goodridge v. Department of\nPublic Health, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798 N.

No country allowed same-sex couples to\nmarry until the Netherlands did so in 2000.4\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 4 Curry-Sumner,   A Patchwork of Partnerships: Comparative Over-\n8                  UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n   What Windsor and the United States seek, therefore, is\nnot the protection of a deeply rooted right but the recogni-\ntion of a very new right, and they seek this innovation not\nfrom a legislative body elected by the people, but from\nunelected judges. Faced with such a request, judges have\ncause for both caution and humility.\n   The family is an ancient and universal human institu-\ntion. Family structure reflects the characteristics of a\ncivilization, and changes in family structure and in the\npopular understanding of marriage and the family can\nhave profound effects. Past changes in the understand-\ning of marriage\u2014for example, the gradual ascendance of\nthe idea that romantic love is a prerequisite to marriage\u2014\nhave had far-reaching consequences. But the process by\nwhich such consequences come about is complex, involving\nthe interaction of numerous factors, and tends to occur\nover an extended period of time.\n   We can expect something similar to take place if same-\nsex marriage becomes widely accepted. The long-term\nconsequences of this change are not now known and are\nunlikely to be ascertainable for some time to come.5 There\nare those who think that allowing same-sex marriage will\nseriously undermine the institution of marriage. See, e.g.,\nS. Girgis, R. Anderson, & R. George, What is Marriage?\nMan and Woman: A Defense 53\u201358 (2012); Finnis, Mar-\nriage: A Basic and Exigent Good, 91 The Monist 388, 398\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nview of Registration Schemes in Europe, in Legal Recognition of Same-\nSex Partnerships 71, 72 (K. Boele-Woelki & A. Fuchs eds., rev. 2d ed.,\n2012).\n  5 As sociologists have documented, it sometimes takes decades to doc-\n\nument the effects of social changes\u2014like the sharp rise in divorce\nrates following the advent of no-fault divorce\u2014on children and society.\nSee generally J. Wallerstein, J. Lewis, & S. Blakeslee, The Unexpected\nLegacy of Divorce: The 25 Year Landmark Study (2000).\n                     Cite as: 570 U.

See, e.g., A.\nSullivan, Virtually Normal: An Argument About Homo-\nsexuality 202\u2013203 (1996); J. Rauch, Gay Marriage: Why It\nIs Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for Amer-\nica 94 (2004).\n  At present, no one\u2014including social scientists, philoso-\nphers, and historians\u2014can predict with any certainty\nwhat the long-term ramifications of widespread ac-\nceptance of same-sex marriage will be. And judges are\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Among those holding that position, some deplore and some applaud\n\nthis predicted development. Compare, e.g., Wardle, \u201cMultiply and\nReplenish\u201d: Considering Same-Sex Marriage in Light of State Interests\nin Marital Procreation, 24 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y 771, 799 (2001)\n(\u201cCulturally, the legalization of same-sex marriage would send a mes-\nsage that would undermine the social boundaries relating to mar-\nriage and family relations. The confusion of social roles linked with\nmarriage and parenting would be tremendous, and the message of\n\u2018anything goes\u2019 in the way of sexual behavior, procreation, and\nparenthood would wreak its greatest havoc among groups of vulnerable\nindividuals who most need the encouragement of bright line laws\nand clear social mores concerning procreative responsibility\u201d) and Gal-\nlagher, (How) Will Gay Marriage Weaken Marriage as a Social Institu-\ntion: A Reply to Andrew Koppelman, 2 U.

The\nMembers of this Court have the authority and the respon-\nsibility to interpret and apply the Constitution. Thus, if\nthe Constitution contained a provision guaranteeing the\nright to marry a person of the same sex, it would be our\nduty to enforce that right. But the Constitution simply\ndoes not speak to the issue of same-sex marriage. In our\nsystem of government, ultimate sovereignty rests with the\npeople, and the people have the right to control their own\ndestiny. Any change on a question so fundamental should\nbe made by the people through their elected officials.\n                             III\n  Perhaps because they cannot show that same-sex mar-\nriage is a fundamental right under our Constitution,\nWindsor and the United States couch their arguments in\nequal protection terms. They argue that \u00a73 of DOMA\ndiscriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, that\nclassifications based on sexual orientation should trigger a\nform of \u201cheightened\u201d scrutiny, and that \u00a73 cannot survive\nsuch scrutiny. They further maintain that the govern-\nmental interests that \u00a73 purports to serve are not suffi-\nciently important and that it has not been adequately\nshown that \u00a73 serves those interests very well. The\nCourt\u2019s holding, too, seems to rest on \u201cthe equal protection\nguarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d ante, at 25\u2014\nalthough the Court is careful not to adopt most of Wind-\nsor\u2019s and the United States\u2019 argument.\n  In my view, the approach that Windsor and the United\nStates advocate is misguided. Our equal protection frame-\nwork, upon which Windsor and the United States rely,\nis a judicial construct that provides a useful mechanism\nfor analyzing a certain universe of equal protection\ncases. But that framework is ill suited for use in evaluat-\ning the constitutionality of laws based on the traditional\nunderstanding of marriage, which fundamentally turn on\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

For example, the Court\nhas held that statutory rape laws that criminalize sexual\nintercourse with a woman under the age of 18 years, but\nplace no similar liability on partners of underage men, are\ngrounded in the very real distinction that \u201cyoung men and\nyoung women are not similarly situated with respect to\nthe problems and the risks of sexual intercourse.\u201d Michael\nM. v. Superior Court, Sonoma Cty., 450 U. S. 464, 471\n(1981) (plurality opnion). The plurality reasoned that\n\u201c[o]nly women may become pregnant, and they suffer\ndisproportionately the profound physical, emotional, and\npsychological consequences of sexual activity.\u201d Ibid. In\nother contexts, however, the Court has found that classifi-\ncations based on gender are \u201carbitrary,\u201d Reed, supra, at\n76, and based on \u201coutmoded notions of the relative capa-\nbilities of men and women,\u201d Cleburne, supra, at 441, as\nwhen a State provides that a man must always be pre-\nferred to an equally qualified woman when both seek to\nadminister the estate of a deceased party, see Reed, supra,\nat 76\u201377.\n   Finally, so-called rational-basis review applies to classi-\nfications based on \u201cdistinguishing characteristics relevant\nto interests the State has the authority to implement.\u201d\nCleburne, supra, at 441. We have long recognized that\n\u201cthe equal protection of the laws must coexist with the\npractical necessity that most legislation classifies for one\npurpose or another, with resulting disadvantages to vari-\nous groups or persons.\u201d Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620,\n631 (1996). As a result, in rational-basis cases, where the\ncourt does not view the classification at issue as \u201cinher-\nently suspect,\u201d Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

That is a striking\nrequest and one that unelected judges should pause before\ngranting. Acceptance of the argument would cast all those\nwho cling to traditional beliefs about the nature of mar-\nriage in the role of bigots or superstitious fools.\n   By asking the Court to strike down DOMA as not satis-\nfying some form of heightened scrutiny, Windsor and the\nUnited States are really seeking to have the Court resolve\na debate between two competing views of marriage.\n   The first and older view, which I will call the \u201ctradi-\ntional\u201d or \u201cconjugal\u201d view, sees marriage as an intrinsically\nopposite-sex institution. BLAG notes that virtually every\nculture, including many not influenced by the Abrahamic\nreligions, has limited marriage to people of the opposite\nsex. Brief for Respondent BLAG (merits) 2 (citing Her\u00ad\nnandez v. Robles, 7 N. Y. 3d 338, 361, 855 N. E. 2d 1, 8\n(2006) (\u201cUntil a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth\nfor almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which\nmarriage existed, that there could be marriages only\nbetween participants of different sex\u201d)). And BLAG at-\ntempts to explain this phenomenon by arguing that the\ninstitution of marriage was created for the purpose of\nchanneling heterosexual intercourse into a structure that\nsupports child rearing. Brief for Respondent BLAG 44\u201346,\n49. Others explain the basis for the institution in more\nphilosophical terms. They argue that marriage is essen-\ntially the solemnizing of a comprehensive, exclusive, per-\nmanent union that is intrinsically ordered to producing\nnew life, even if it does not always do so. See, e.g., Girgis,\nAnderson, & George, What is Marriage? Man and Woman:\n14                  UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nA Defense, at 23\u201328. While modern cultural changes have\nweakened the link between marriage and procreation in\nthe popular mind, there is no doubt that, throughout\nhuman history and across many cultures, marriage has\nbeen viewed as an exclusively opposite-sex institution\nand as one inextricably linked to procreation and biologi-\ncal kinship.\n   The other, newer view is what I will call the \u201cconsent-\nbased\u201d vision of marriage, a vision that primarily defines\nmarriage as the solemnization of mutual commitment\u2014\nmarked by strong emotional attachment and sexual at-\ntraction\u2014between two persons. At least as it applies to\nheterosexual couples, this view of marriage now plays a\nvery prominent role in the popular understanding of the\ninstitution. Indeed, our popular culture is infused with\nthis understanding of marriage. Proponents of same-sex\nmarriage argue that because gender differentiation is not\nrelevant to this vision, the exclusion of same-sex couples\nfrom the institution of marriage is rank discrimination.\n   The Constitution does not codify either of these views of\nmarriage (although I suspect it would have been hard at\nthe time of the adoption of the Constitution or the Fifth\nAmendment to find Americans who did not take the tradi-\ntional view for granted). The silence of the Constitution\non this question should be enough to end the matter as\nfar as the judiciary is concerned. Yet, Windsor and the\nUnited States implicitly ask us to endorse the consent-based\nview of marriage and to reject the traditional view, there-\nby arrogating to ourselves the power to decide a question\nthat philosophers, historians, social scientists, and theolo-\ngians are better qualified to explore.7 Because our consti-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   7 The degree to which this question is intractable to typical judicial\n\nprocesses of decisionmaking was highlighted by the trial in Hol\u00ad\nlingsworth v.

Only an arrogant\nlegal culture that has lost all appreciation of its own limitations could\ntake such a suggestion seriously.\n16              UNITED STATES v. WINDSOR\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\n  Legislatures, however, have little choice but to decide\nbetween the two views. We have long made clear that\nneither the political branches of the Federal Government\nnor state governments are required to be neutral between\ncompeting visions of the good, provided that the vision of\nthe good that they adopt is not countermanded by the\nConstitution. See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173,\n192 (1991) (\u201c[T]he government \u2018may make a value judg-\nment favoring childbirth over abortion\u2019 \u201d (quoting Maher v.\nRue, 432 U. S. 464, 474 (1977))). Accordingly, both Con-\ngress and the States are entitled to enact laws recognizing\neither of the two understandings of marriage. And given\nthe size of government and the degree to which it now\nregulates daily life, it seems unlikely that either Congress\nor the States could maintain complete neutrality even if\nthey tried assiduously to do so.\n  Rather than fully embracing the arguments made by\nWindsor and the United States, the Court strikes down \u00a73\nof DOMA as a classification not properly supported by its\nobjectives. The Court reaches this conclusion in part\nbecause it believes that \u00a73 encroaches upon the States\u2019\nsovereign prerogative to define marriage. See ante, at 21\u2013\n22 (\u201cAs the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its\npurpose is to discourage enactment of state same-sex\nmarriage laws and to restrict the freedom and choice of\ncouples married under those laws if they are enacted. The\ncongressional goal was \u2018to put a thumb on the scales and\ninfluence a state\u2019s decision as to how to shape its own\nmarriage laws\u2019 \u201d (quoting Massachusetts v. United States\nDept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F. 3d 1, 12\u201313\n(CA1 2012))). Indeed, the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion is\nthat DOMA falls afoul of the Fifth Amendment because it\n\u201csingles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled\nto recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty\u201d\nand \u201cimposes a disability on the class by refusing to\nacknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          17\n\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\n\nproper.\u201d Ante, at 25 (emphasis added).\n   To the extent that the Court takes the position that the\nquestion of same-sex marriage should be resolved primar-\nily at the state level, I wholeheartedly agree. I hope that\nthe Court will ultimately permit the people of each State\nto decide this question for themselves. Unless the Court is\nwilling to allow this to occur, the whiffs of federalism in\nthe today\u2019s opinion of the Court will soon be scattered to\nthe wind.\n   In any event, \u00a73 of DOMA, in my view, does not en-\ncroach on the prerogatives of the States, assuming of\ncourse that the many federal statutes affected by DOMA\nhave not already done so. Section 3 does not prevent any\nState from recognizing same-sex marriage or from extend-\ning to same-sex couples any right, privilege, benefit, or\nobligation stemming from state law. All that \u00a73 does is to\ndefine a class of persons to whom federal law extends cer-\ntain special benefits and upon whom federal law imposes\ncertain special burdens. In these provisions, Congress\nused marital status as a way of defining this class\u2014in\npart, I assume, because it viewed marriage as a valua-\nble institution to be fostered and in part because it viewed\nmarried couples as comprising a unique type of economic\nunit that merits special regulatory treatment. Assuming\nthat Congress has the power under the Constitution to\nenact the laws affected by \u00a73, Congress has the power to\ndefine the category of persons to whom those laws apply.\n                        *   *    *\n  For these reasons, I would hold that \u00a73 of DOMA does\nnot violate the Fifth Amendment. I respectfully dissent.\n</pre>",
