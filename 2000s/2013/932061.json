PERRY ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 12–144.      Argued March 26, 2013—Decided June 26, 2013\nAfter the California Supreme Court held that limiting marriage to op-\n  posite-sex couples violated the California Constitution, state voters\n  passed a ballot initiative known as Proposition 8, amending the State\n  Constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a\n  woman. Respondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, filed suit\n  in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under the Due Process and\n  Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and naming\n  as defendants California’s Governor and other state and local officials\n  responsible for enforcing California’s marriage laws. The officials re-\n  fused to defend the law, so the District Court allowed petitioners—\n  the initiative’s official proponents—to intervene to defend it. After a\n  bench trial, the court declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional and en-\n  joined the public officials named as defendants from enforcing the\n  law. Those officials elected not to appeal, but petitioners did. The\n  Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court:\n  whether official proponents of a ballot initiative have authority to as-\n  sert the State’s interest in defending the constitutionality of the ini-\n  tiative when public officials refuse to do so. After the California Su-\n  preme Court answered in the affirmative, the Ninth Circuit\n  concluded that petitioners had standing under federal law to defend\n  Proposition 8’s constitutionality. On the merits, the court affirmed\n  the District Court’s order.\nHeld: Petitioners did not have standing to appeal the District Court’s\n order. Pp. 5–17.\n    (a) Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of fed-\n eral courts to deciding actual “Cases” or “Controversies.” §2. One es-\n sential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the\n power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. In oth-\n2                      HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    er words, the litigant must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible\n    harm. Although most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has\n    satisfied the requirement when filing suit, Article III demands that\n    an “actual controversy” persist throughout all stages of litigation. Al-\n    ready, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___. Standing “must be met\n    by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by per-\n    sons appearing in courts of first instance.” Arizonans for Official\n    English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64. The parties do not contest that\n    respondents had standing to initiate this case against the California\n    officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8. But once the District\n    Court issued its order, respondents no longer had any injury to re-\n    dress, and the state officials chose not to appeal. The only individu-\n    als who sought to appeal were petitioners, who had intervened in the\n    District Court, but they had not been ordered to do or refrain from\n    doing anything. Their only interest was to vindicate the constitu-\n    tional validity of a generally applicable California law. As this Court\n    has repeatedly held, such a “generalized grievance”—no matter how\n    sincere—is insufficient to confer standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of\n    Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573–574. Petitioners claim that the Califor-\n    nia Constitution and election laws give them a “ ‘unique,’ ‘special,’\n    and ‘distinct’ role in the initiative process,” Reply Brief 5, but that is\n    only true during the process of enacting the law. Once Proposition 8\n    was approved, it became a duly enacted constitutional amendment.\n    Petitioners have no role—special or otherwise—in its enforcement.\n    They therefore have no “personal stake” in defending its enforcement\n    that is distinguishable from the general interest of every California\n    citizen. No matter how deeply committed petitioners may be to up-\n    holding Proposition 8, that is not a particularized interest sufficient\n    to create a case or controversy under Article III. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Petitioners’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 9–\n    16.\n         (1) They claim that they may assert the State’s interest on the\n    State’s behalf, but it is a “fundamental restriction on our authority”\n    that “[i]n the ordinary course, a litigant . . . cannot rest a claim to re-\n    lief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Powers v. Ohio,\n    499 U. S. 400, 410. In Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, for example,\n    a pediatrician engaged in private practice was not permitted to de-\n    fend the constitutionality of Illinois’ abortion law after the State\n    chose not to appeal an adverse ruling. The state attorney general’s\n    “letter of interest,” explaining that the State’s interest in the proceed-\n    ing was “ ‘essentially co-terminous with’ ” Diamond’s position, id., at\n    61, was insufficient, since Diamond was unable to assert an injury of\n    his own, id, at 65. Pp. 9–10.\n         (2) Petitioners contend the California Supreme Court’s determi-\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nnation that they were authorized under California law to assert the\nState’s interest in the validity of Proposition 8 means that they “need\nno more show a personal injury, separate from the State’s indisputa-\nble interest in the validity of its law, than would California’s Attor-\nney General or did the legislative leaders held to have standing in\nKarcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72 (1987).” Reply Brief 6. But far from\nsupporting petitioners’ standing, Karcher is compelling precedent\nagainst it. In that case, after the New Jersey attorney general re-\nfused to defend the constitutionality of a state law, leaders of New\nJersey’s Legislature were permitted to appear, in their official capaci-\nties, in the District Court and Court of Appeals to defend the law.\nWhat is significant about Karcher, however, is what happened after\nthe Court of Appeals decision. The legislators lost their leadership\npositions, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court. The Court\nheld that they could not do so. Although they could participate in the\nlawsuit in their official capacities as presiding officers of the legisla-\nture, as soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing. Id., at 81.\nPetitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this\nlitigation solely as private parties. Pp. 10–13.\n     (3) Nor is support found in dicta in Arizonans for Official English\nv. Arizona, supra. There, in expressing “grave doubts” about the\nstanding of ballot initiative sponsors to defend the constitutionality of\nan Arizona initiative, the Court noted that it was “aware of no Arizo-\nna law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Ari-\nzona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initi-\natives made law of the State.” Id., at 65. Petitioners argue that, by\nvirtue of the California Supreme Court’s decision, they are authorized\nto act as “agents of the people of California.” Brief for Petitioners 15.\nBut that Court never described petitioners as “agents of the people.”\nAll the California Supreme Court’s decision stands for is that, so far\nas California is concerned, petitioners may “assert legal arguments in\ndefense of the state’s interest in the validity of the initiative meas-\nure” in federal court. 628 F. 3d 1191, 1193. That interest is by defi-\nnition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert\nsuch an interest that they lack standing under this Court’s prece-\ndents. Petitioners are also plainly not agents of the State. As an ini-\ntial matter, petitioners’ newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with\ntheir representations to the District Court, where they claimed to\nrepresent their own interests as official proponents. More to the\npoint, the basic features of an agency relationship are missing here:\nPetitioners are not subject to the control of any principal, and they\nowe no fiduciary obligation to anyone. As one amicus puts it, “the\nproponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspec-\nified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to\n4                      HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    whatever extent they choose to defend it.” Brief for Walter Dellinger\n    23. Pp. 13–16.\n      (c) The Court does not question California’s sovereign right to\n    maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to\n    defend their initiatives in California courts. But standing in federal\n    court is a question of federal law, not state law. No matter its rea-\n    sons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have stand-\n    ing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this\n    Court’s settled law to the contrary. Article III’s requirement that a\n    party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a per-\n    sonal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of\n    the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers. States can-\n    not alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise\n    lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.

That question has also given rise to litigation.\nIn this case, petitioners, who oppose same-sex marriage,\nask us to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause\n“prohibits the State of California from defining marriage\nas the union of a man and a woman.” Pet. for Cert. i.\nRespondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, view\nthe issue in somewhat different terms: For them, it is\nwhether California—having previously recognized the\nright of same-sex couples to marry—may reverse that\ndecision through a referendum.\n  Federal courts have authority under the Constitution to\nanswer such questions only if necessary to do so in the\ncourse of deciding an actual “case” or “controversy.” As\nused in the Constitution, those words do not include every\nsort of dispute, but only those “historically viewed as\ncapable of resolution through the judicial process.” Flast\nv.

PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlimit on our power: It ensures that we act as judges, and\ndo not engage in policymaking properly left to elected\nrepresentatives.\n  For there to be such a case or controversy, it is not\nenough that the party invoking the power of the court\nhave a keen interest in the issue. That party must also\nhave “standing,” which requires, among other things, that\nit have suffered a concrete and particularized injury.\nBecause we find that petitioners do not have standing, we\nhave no authority to decide this case on the merits, and\nneither did the Ninth Circuit.\n                               I\n   In 2008, the California Supreme Court held that limit-\ning the official designation of marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the Califor-\nnia Constitution.

Later that year, California voters passed\nthe ballot initiative at the center of this dispute, known as\nProposition 8. That proposition amended the California\nConstitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”\nCal. Const., Art. I, §7.5. Shortly thereafter, the California\nSupreme Court rejected a procedural challenge to the\namendment, and held that the Proposition was properly\nenacted under California law. Strauss v. Horton, 46 Cal.\n4th 364, 474–475, 207 P. 3d 48, 122 (2009).\n   According to the California Supreme Court, Proposition\n8 created a “narrow and limited exception” to the state\nconstitutional rights otherwise guaranteed to same-sex\ncouples. Id., at 388, 207 P. 3d, at 61. Under California\nlaw, same-sex couples have a right to enter into relation-\nships recognized by the State as “domestic partnerships,”\nwhich carry “the same rights, protections, and benefits,\nand shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obliga-\ntions, and duties under law . . . as are granted to and\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposed upon spouses.” Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §297.5(a)\n(West 2004). In In re Marriage Cases, the California\nSupreme Court concluded that the California Constitution\nfurther guarantees same-sex couples “all of the constitu-\ntionally based incidents of marriage,” including the right\nto have that marriage “officially recognized” as such by the\nState. 43 Cal. 4th, at 829, 183 P. 3d, at 433–434. Proposi-\ntion 8, the court explained in Strauss, left those rights\nlargely undisturbed, reserving only “the official designa-\ntion of the term ‘marriage’ for the union of opposite-sex\ncouples as a matter of state constitutional law.” 46 Cal.\n4th, at 388, 207 P. 3d, at 61.\n   Respondents, two same-sex couples who wish to marry,\nfiled suit in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The\ncomplaint named as defendants California’s Governor,\nattorney general, and various other state and local offi-\ncials responsible for enforcing California’s marriage laws.\nThose officials refused to defend the law, although they\nhave continued to enforce it throughout this litigation.\nThe District Court allowed petitioners—the official propo-\nnents of the initiative, see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §342 (West\n2003)—to intervene to defend it. After a 12-day bench\ntrial, the District Court declared Proposition 8 uncon-\nstitutional, permanently enjoining the California officials\nnamed as defendants from enforcing the law, and “direct-\ning the official defendants that all persons under their\ncontrol or supervision” shall not enforce it. Perry v.\nSchwarzenegger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440578\"><a href=\"/cand/8oey/perry-v-schwarzenegger/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

When petitioners did, the Ninth Circuit asked\nthem to address “why this appeal should not be dismissed\nfor lack of Article III standing.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger,\nCiv. No. 10–16696 (CA9, Aug. 16, 2010), p. 2. After brief-\n4                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning and argument, the Ninth Circuit certified a question to\nthe California Supreme Court:\n    “Whether under Article II, Section 8 of the California\n    Constitution, or otherwise under California law, the\n    official proponents of an initiative measure possess\n    either a particularized interest in the initiative’s valid-\n    ity or the authority to assert the State’s interest in the\n    initiative’s validity, which would enable them to de-\n    fend the constitutionality of the initiative upon its\n    adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the initia-\n    tive, when the public officials charged with that duty\n    refuse to do so.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 628 F. 3d\n    1191, 1193 (2011).\n   The California Supreme Court agreed to decide the\ncertified question, and answered in the affirmative. With-\nout addressing whether the proponents have a particular-\nized interest of their own in an initiative’s validity, the\ncourt concluded that “[i]n a postelection challenge to a\nvoter-approved initiative measure, the official proponents\nof the initiative are authorized under California law to\nappear and assert the state’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity and to appeal a judgment invalidating the meas-\nure when the public officials who ordinarily defend the\nmeasure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.”\nPerry v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2318357\"><a href=\"/dc/cTaF/brown-v-does/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1127, 265 P. 3d 1002,\n1007 (2011).\n   Relying on that answer, the Ninth Circuit concluded\nthat petitioners had standing under federal law to defend\nthe constitutionality of Proposition 8. California, it rea-\nsoned, “ ‘has standing to defend the constitutionality of its\n[laws],’ ” and States have the “prerogative, as independent\nsovereigns, to decide for themselves who may assert their\ninterests.” Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3d 1052, 1070, 1071\n(2012) (quoting Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 62\n(1986)). “All a federal court need determine is that the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate has suffered a harm sufficient to confer standing and\nthat the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt is authorized by the state to represent its interest in\nremedying that harm.” 671 F. 3d, at 1072.\n   On the merits, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt. The court held the Proposition unconstitutional\nunder the rationale of our decision in Romer v. Evans, 517\nU. S. 620 (1996). 671 F. 3d, at 1076, 1095. In the Ninth\nCircuit’s view, Romer stands for the proposition that “the\nEqual Protection Clause requires the state to have a legit-\nimate reason for withdrawing a right or benefit from one\ngroup but not others, whether or not it was required to\nconfer that right or benefit in the first place.” 671 F. 3d, at\n1083–1084. The Ninth Circuit concluded that “taking\naway the official designation” of “marriage” from same-sex\ncouples, while continuing to afford those couples all the\nrights and obligations of marriage, did not further any\nlegitimate interest of the State. Id., at 1095. Proposition\n8, in the court’s view, violated the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause it served no purpose “but to impose on gays and\nlesbians, through the public law, a majority’s private\ndisapproval of them and their relationships.” Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari to review that determination, and\ndirected that the parties also brief and argue “Whether\npetitioners have standing under Article III, §2, of the\nConstitution in this case.” 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n  Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power\nof federal courts to deciding actual “Cases” or “Controver-\nsies.” §2. One essential aspect of this requirement is that\nany person invoking the power of a federal court must\ndemonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant\nto prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized\ninjury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,\nand is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial deci-\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsion. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–\n561 (1992). In other words, for a federal court to have\nauthority under the Constitution to settle a dispute, the\nparty before it must seek a remedy for a personal and\ntangible harm. “The presence of a disagreement, however\nsharp and acrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to\nmeet Art. III’s requirements.” Diamond, supra, at 62.\n   The doctrine of standing, we recently explained, “serves\nto prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp\nthe powers of the political branches.” Clapper v. Amnesty\nInt’l USA, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In light\nof this “overriding and time-honored concern about keep-\ning the Judiciary’s power within its proper constitu-\ntional sphere, we must put aside the natural urge to\nproceed directly to the merits of [an] important dispute\nand to ‘settle’ it for the sake of convenience and effi-\nciency.” Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 820 (1997) (footnote\nomitted).\n   Most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has\nsatisfied the requirement when filing suit, but Article III\ndemands that an “actual controversy” persist throughout\nall stages of litigation. Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). That means that standing “must be met\nby persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be\nmet by persons appearing in courts of first instance.”\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64\n(1997). We therefore must decide whether petitioners had\nstanding to appeal the District Court’s order.\n   Respondents initiated this case in the District Court\nagainst the California officials responsible for enforcing\nProposition 8. The parties do not contest that respondents\nhad Article III standing to do so. Each couple expressed a\ndesire to marry and obtain “official sanction” from the\nState, which was unavailable to them given the declara-\ntion in Proposition 8 that “marriage” in California is solely\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbetween a man and a woman. App. 59.\n  After the District Court declared Proposition 8 unconsti-\ntutional and enjoined the state officials named as defend-\nants from enforcing it, however, the inquiry under Article\nIII changed. Respondents no longer had any injury to\nredress—they had won—and the state officials chose not\nto appeal.\n  The only individuals who sought to appeal that order\nwere petitioners, who had intervened in the District\nCourt. But the District Court had not ordered them to do\nor refrain from doing anything. To have standing, a liti-\ngant must seek relief for an injury that affects him in\na “personal and individual way.” Defenders of Wildlife,\nsupra, at 560, n. 1. He must possess a “direct stake in\nthe outcome” of the case. Arizonans for Official English,\nsupra, at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here,\nhowever, petitioners had no “direct stake” in the outcome\nof their appeal. Their only interest in having the District\nCourt order reversed was to vindicate the constitutional\nvalidity of a generally applicable California law.\n  We have repeatedly held that such a “generalized griev-\nance,” no matter how sincere, is insufficient to confer\nstanding. A litigant “raising only a generally available\ngrievance about government—claiming only harm to his\nand every citizen’s interest in proper application of the\nConstitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more\ndirectly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public\nat large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.”\nDefenders of Wildlife, supra, at 573–574; see Lance v.\nCoffman, 549 U. S. 437, 439 (2007) (per curiam) (“Our\nrefusal to serve as a forum for generalized grievances has\na lengthy pedigree.”); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 754\n(1984) (“an asserted right to have the Government act in\naccordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to\nconfer jurisdiction on a federal court”); Massachusetts v.\nMellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (“The party who invokes\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v.

True enough—but only when it comes to the pro-\ncess of enacting the law. Upon submitting the proposed\ninitiative to the attorney general, petitioners became the\nofficial “proponents” of Proposition 8. Cal. Elec. Code Ann.\n§342 (West 2003). As such, they were responsible for\ncollecting the signatures required to qualify the measure\nfor the ballot. §§9607–9609. After those signatures were\ncollected, the proponents alone had the right to file the\nmeasure with election officials to put it on the ballot.\n§9032. Petitioners also possessed control over the argu-\nments in favor of the initiative that would appear in Cali-\nfornia’s ballot pamphlets. §§9064, 9065, 9067, 9069.\n    But once Proposition 8 was approved by the voters, the\nmeasure became “a duly enacted constitutional amend-\nment or statute.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1147, 265 P. 3d, at 1021.\nPetitioners have no role—special or otherwise—in the\nenforcement of Proposition 8. See id., at 1159, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1029 (petitioners do not “possess any official authority\n. . . to directly enforce the initiative measure in question”).\nThey therefore have no “personal stake” in defending its\nenforcement that is distinguishable from the general\ninterest of every citizen of California. Defenders of Wild-\nlife, supra, at 560–561.\n    Article III standing “is not to be placed in the hands of\n‘concerned bystanders,’ who will use it simply as a ‘vehicle\nfor the vindication of value interests.’ ” Diamond, 476\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

No matter how deeply committed petitioners\nmay be to upholding Proposition 8 or how “zealous [their]\nadvocacy,” post, at 4 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), that is not\na “particularized” interest sufficient to create a case or\ncontroversy under Article III. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S., at 560, and n. 1; see Arizonans for Official English,\n520 U. S., at 65 (“Nor has this Court ever identified ini-\ntiative proponents as Article-III-qualified defenders of the\nmeasures they advocated.”); Don’t Bankrupt Washington\nCommittee v. Continental Ill. Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of\nChicago, 460 U. S. 1077 (1983) (summarily dismissing, for\nlack of standing, appeal by an initiative proponent from a\ndecision holding the initiative unconstitutional).\n                              III\n\n                               A\n\n   Without a judicially cognizable interest of their own,\npetitioners attempt to invoke that of someone else. They\nassert that even if they have no cognizable interest in\nappealing the District Court’s judgment, the State of\nCalifornia does, and they may assert that interest on the\nState’s behalf. It is, however, a “fundamental restriction\non our authority” that “[i]n the ordinary course, a litigant\nmust assert his or her own legal rights and interests,\nand cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or inter-\nests of third parties.” Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410\n(1991). There are “certain, limited exceptions” to that rule.\nIbid. But even when we have allowed litigants to assert\nthe interests of others, the litigants themselves still\n“must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving [them] a\nsufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in\ndispute.” Id., at 411 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In Diamond v. Charles, for example, we refused to allow\nDiamond, a pediatrician engaged in private practice in\nIllinois, to defend the constitutionality of the State’s abor-\ntion law. In that case, a group of physicians filed a con-\n10                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutional challenge to the Illinois statute in federal\ncourt. The State initially defended the law, and Diamond,\na professed “conscientious object[or] to abortions,” in-\ntervened to defend it alongside the State. 476 U. S., at\n57–58.\n    After the Seventh Circuit affirmed a permanent injunc-\ntion against enforcing several provisions of the law, the\nState chose not to pursue an appeal to this Court. But\nwhen Diamond did, the state attorney general filed a\n“ ‘letter of interest,’ ” explaining that the State’s interest in\nthe proceeding was “ ‘essentially co-terminous with the\nposition on the issues set forth by [Diamond].’ ” Id., at 61.\nThat was not enough, we held, to allow the appeal to\nproceed. As the Court explained, “[e]ven if there were cir-\ncumstances in which a private party would have stand-\ning to defend the constitutionality of a challenged statute,\nthis [was] not one of them,” because Diamond was not able\nto assert an injury in fact of his own. Id., at 65 (footnote\nomitted). And without “any judicially cognizable interest,”\nDiamond could not “maintain the litigation abandoned by\nthe State.” Id., at 71.\n    For the reasons we have explained, petitioners have\nlikewise not suffered an injury in fact, and therefore would\nordinarily have no standing to assert the State’s interests.\n                             B\n  Petitioners contend that this case is different, because\nthe California Supreme Court has determined that they\nare “authorized under California law to appear and assert\nthe state’s interest” in the validity of Proposition 8. 52\nCal. 4th, at 1127, 265 P. 3d, at 1007. The court below\nagreed: “All a federal court need determine is that the\nstate has suffered a harm sufficient to confer standing and\nthat the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt is authorized by the state to represent its interest in\nremedying that harm.” 671 F. 3d, at 1072. As petitioners\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nput it, they “need no more show a personal injury, sepa-\nrate from the State’s indisputable interest in the validity\nof its law, than would California’s Attorney General or did\nthe legislative leaders held to have standing in Karcher v.\nMay, 484 U. S. 72 (1987).” Reply Brief 6.\n   In Karcher, we held that two New Jersey state legis-\nlators—Speaker of the General Assembly Alan Karcher\nand President of the Senate Carmen Orechio—could inter-\nvene in a suit against the State to defend the constitutionality\nof a New Jersey law, after the New Jersey attorney gen-\neral had declined to do so. 484 U. S., at 75, 81–82. “Since\nthe New Jersey Legislature had authority under state law\nto represent the State’s interests in both the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals,” we held that the Speaker and\nthe President, in their official capacities, could vindicate\nthat interest in federal court on the legislature’s behalf.\nId., at 82.\n   Far from supporting petitioners’ standing, however,\nKarcher is compelling precedent against it. The legislators\nin that case intervened in their official capacities as\nSpeaker and President of the legislature. No one doubts\nthat a State has a cognizable interest “in the continued\nenforceability” of its laws that is harmed by a judicial\ndecision declaring a state law unconstitutional. Maine v.\nTaylor, 477 U. S. 131, 137 (1986). To vindicate that inter-\nest or any other, a State must be able to designate agents\nto represent it in federal court. See Poindexter v. Green-\nhow, 114 U. S. 270, 288 (1885) (“The State is a political\ncorporate body [that] can act only through agents”). That\nagent is typically the State’s attorney general. But state\nlaw may provide for other officials to speak for the State in\nfederal court, as New Jersey law did for the State’s presid-\ning legislative officers in Karcher. See 484 U. S., at 81–82.\n   What is significant about Karcher is what happened\nafter the Court of Appeals decision in that case. Karcher\nand Orechio lost their positions as Speaker and President,\n12              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court. We held\nthat they could not do so. We explained that while they\nwere able to participate in the lawsuit in their official\ncapacities as presiding officers of the incumbent legisla-\nture, “since they no longer hold those offices, they lack\nauthority to pursue this appeal.” Id., at 81.\n   The point of Karcher is not that a State could authorize\nprivate parties to represent its interests; Karcher and\nOrechio were permitted to proceed only because they were\nstate officers, acting in an official capacity. As soon as\nthey lost that capacity, they lost standing. Petitioners\nhere hold no office and have always participated in this\nlitigation solely as private parties.\n   The cases relied upon by the dissent, see post, at 11–12,\nprovide petitioners no more support. The dissent’s primary\nauthorities, in fact, do not discuss standing at all. See\nYoung v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481\nU. S. 787 (1987); United States v. Providence Journal Co.,\n485 U. S. 693 (1988). And none comes close to establish-\ning that mere authorization to represent a third party’s\ninterests is sufficient to confer Article III standing on\nprivate parties with no injury of their own.\n   The dissent highlights the discretion exercised by spe-\ncial prosecutors appointed by federal courts to pursue\ncontempt charges. See post, at 11 (citing Young, supra, at\n807). Such prosecutors do enjoy a degree of independence\nin carrying out their appointed role, but no one would\nsuppose that they are not subject to the ultimate au-\nthority of the court that appointed them. See also Prov-\nidence Journal, supra, at 698–707 (recognizing further\ncontrol exercised by the Solicitor General over special\nprosecutors).\n   The dissent’s remaining cases, which at least consider\nstanding, are readily distinguishable. See Vermont Agency\nof Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens,\n529 U. S. 765, 771–778 (2000) (justifying qui tam actions\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Arizona, 520\nU. S. 43. The plaintiff in Arizonans for Official English\nfiled a constitutional challenge to an Arizona ballot initia-\ntive declaring English “ ‘the official language of the State\nof Arizona.’ ” Id., at 48. After the District Court declared\nthe initiative unconstitutional, Arizona’s Governor an-\nnounced that she would not pursue an appeal. Instead,\nthe principal sponsor of the ballot initiative—the Arizo-\nnans for Official English Committee—sought to defend the\nmeasure in the Ninth Circuit. Id., at 55–56, 58. Analogiz-\ning the sponsors to the Arizona Legislature, the Ninth\nCircuit held that the Committee was “qualified to defend\n[the initiative] on appeal,” and affirmed the District Court.\nId., at 58, 61.\n   Before finding the case mooted by other events, this\nCourt expressed “grave doubts” about the Ninth Circuit’s\nstanding analysis.      Id., at 66.      We reiterated that\n“[s]tanding to defend on appeal in the place of an original\ndefendant . . . demands that the litigant possess ‘a direct\n14               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstake in the outcome.’ ” Id., at 64 (quoting Diamond, 476\nU. S., at 62). We recognized that a legislator authorized\nby state law to represent the State’s interest may satisfy\nstanding requirements, as in Karcher, supra, at 82, but\nnoted that the Arizona committee and its members were\n“not elected representatives, and we [we]re aware of no\nArizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the\npeople of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the\nconstitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.”\nArizonans for Official English, supra, at 65.\n   Petitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Su-\npreme Court’s decision, they are authorized to act “ ‘as\nagents of the people’ of California.” Brief for Petitioners\n15 (quoting Arizonans for Official English, supra, at 65).\nBut that Court never described petitioners as “agents of\nthe people,” or of anyone else. Nor did the Ninth Circuit.\nThe Ninth Circuit asked—and the California Supreme\nCourt answered—only whether petitioners had “the au-\nthority to assert the State’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity.” 628 F. 3d, at 1193; 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265\nP. 3d, at 1005. All that the California Supreme Court\ndecision stands for is that, so far as California is con-\ncerned, petitioners may argue in defense of Proposition 8.\nThis “does not mean that the proponents become de facto\npublic officials”; the authority they enjoy is “simply the\nauthority to participate as parties in a court action and to\nassert legal arguments in defense of the state’s interest in\nthe validity of the initiative measure.” Id., at 1159, 265\nP. 3d, at 1029. That interest is by definition a generalized\none, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an\ninterest that they lack standing under our precedents.\n   And petitioners are plainly not agents of the State—\n“formal” or otherwise, see post, at 7. As an initial matter,\npetitioners’ newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with\ntheir representations to the District Court. When the\nproponents sought to intervene in this case, they did not\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npurport to be agents of California. They argued instead\nthat “no other party in this case w[ould] adequately rep-\nresent their interests as official proponents.” Motion to\nIntervene in No. 09–2292 (ND Cal.), p. 6 (emphasis\nadded). It was their “unique legal status” as official\nproponents—not an agency relationship with the people of\nCalifornia—that petitioners claimed “endow[ed] them with\na significantly protectable interest” in ensuring that the\nDistrict Court not “undo[ ] all that they ha[d] done in\nobtaining . . . enactment” of Proposition 8. Id., at 10, 11.\n    More to the point, the most basic features of an agency\nrelationship are missing here. Agency requires more than\nmere authorization to assert a particular interest. “An\nessential element of agency is the principal’s right to\ncontrol the agent’s actions.” 1 Restatement (Third) of\nAgency §1.01, Comment f (2005) (hereinafter Restate-\nment). Yet petitioners answer to no one; they decide for\nthemselves, with no review, what arguments to make and\nhow to make them. Unlike California’s attorney general,\nthey are not elected at regular intervals—or elected at all.\nSee Cal. Const., Art. V, §11. No provision provides for\ntheir removal. As one amicus explains, “the proponents\napparently have an unelected appointment for an unspeci-\nfied period of time as defenders of the initiative, however\nand to whatever extent they choose to defend it.” Brief for\nWalter Dellinger 23.\n    “If the relationship between two persons is one of agency\n. . . , the agent owes a fiduciary obligation to the princi-\npal.” 1 Restatement §1.01, Comment e. But petitioners\nowe nothing of the sort to the people of California. Unlike\nCalifornia’s elected officials, they have taken no oath of\noffice. E.g., Cal. Const., Art. XX, §3 (prescribing the oath\nfor “all public officers and employees, executive, legisla-\ntive, and judicial”). As the California Supreme Court\nexplained, petitioners are bound simply by “the same\nethical constraints that apply to all other parties in a legal\n16               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproceeding.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P. 3d, at 1029.\nThey are free to pursue a purely ideological commit-\nment to the law’s constitutionality without the need to\ntake cognizance of resource constraints, changes in\npublic opinion, or potential ramifications for other state\npriorities.\n   Finally, the California Supreme Court stated that “[t]he\nquestion of who should bear responsibility for any attorney\nfee award . . . is entirely distinct from the question” before\nit. Id., at 1161, 265 P. 3d, at 1031. (emphasis added). But\nit is hornbook law that “a principal has a duty to indem-\nnify the agent against expenses and other losses incurred\nby the agent in defending against actions brought by third\nparties if the agent acted with actual authority in taking\nthe action challenged by the third party’s suit.” 2 Re-\nstatement §8.14, Comment d. If the issue of fees is entirely\ndistinct from the authority question, then authority cannot\nbe based on agency.\n   Neither the California Supreme Court nor the Ninth\nCircuit ever described the proponents as agents of the\nState, and they plainly do not qualify as such.\n                              IV\n  The dissent eloquently recounts the California Supreme\nCourt’s reasons for deciding that state law authorizes\npetitioners to defend Proposition 8. See post, at 3–5. We\ndo not “disrespect[ ]” or “disparage[ ]” those reasons. Post,\nat 12. Nor do we question California’s sovereign right to\nmaintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative\nproponents to defend their initiatives in California courts,\nwhere Article III does not apply. But as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 1, standing in federal court is a\nquestion of federal law, not state law. And no matter its\nreasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should\nhave standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance\ncannot override our settled law to the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Proper resolution of the\njusticiability question requires, in this case, a threshold\ndetermination of state law. The state-law question is how\nCalifornia defines and elaborates the status and authority\nof an initiative’s proponents who seek to intervene in court\nto defend the initiative after its adoption by the electorate.\nThose state-law issues have been addressed in a metic-\nulous and unanimous opinion by the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia.\n   Under California law, a proponent has the authority to\nappear in court and assert the State’s interest in defend-\ning an enacted initiative when the public officials charged\nwith that duty refuse to do so. The State deems such an\nappearance essential to the integrity of its initiative pro-\ncess. Yet the Court today concludes that this state-defined\nstatus and this state-conferred right fall short of meeting\nfederal requirements because the proponents cannot point\nto a formal delegation of authority that tracks the re-\nquirements of the Restatement of Agency. But the State\nSupreme Court’s definition of proponents’ powers is bind-\n2                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ning on this Court. And that definition is fully sufficient to\nestablish the standing and adversity that are requisites\nfor justiciability under Article III of the United States\nConstitution.\n   In my view Article III does not require California, when\ndeciding who may appear in court to defend an initiative\non its behalf, to comply with the Restatement of Agency or\nwith this Court’s view of how a State should make its laws\nor structure its government. The Court’s reasoning does\nnot take into account the fundamental principles or the\npractical dynamics of the initiative system in California,\nwhich uses this mechanism to control and to bypass pub-\nlic officials—the same officials who would not defend the\ninitiative, an injury the Court now leaves unremedied.\nThe Court’s decision also has implications for the 26 other\nStates that use an initiative or popular referendum sys-\ntem and which, like California, may choose to have initia-\ntive proponents stand in for the State when public officials\ndecline to defend an initiative in litigation. See M. Waters,\nInitiative and Referendum Almanac 12 (2003). In my sub-\nmission, the Article III requirement for a justiciable case\nor controversy does not prevent proponents from having\ntheir day in court.\n   These are the premises for this respectful dissent.\n                               I\n  As the Court explains, the State of California sustained\na concrete injury, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of\nArticle III, when a United States District Court nullified a\nportion of its State Constitution. See ante, at 11 (citing\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 137 (1986)). To determine\nwhether justiciability continues in appellate proceedings\nafter the State Executive acquiesced in the District Court’s\nadverse judgment, it is necessary to ascertain what per-\nsons, if any, have “authority under state law to represent\nthe State’s interests” in federal court.

Arizona, 520 U.

Ante,\nat 8. If that were the end of the matter, the Court’s analy-\nsis would have somewhat more force. But it is not the end\nof the matter. It is for California, not this Court, to de-\ntermine whether and to what extent the Elections Code\nprovisions are instructive and relevant in determining the\nauthority of proponents to assert the State’s interest in\npostenactment judicial proceedings. And it is likewise not\nfor this Court to say that a State must determine the\nsubstance and meaning of its laws by statute, or by judi-\ncial decision, or by a combination of the two. See Sweezy\nv. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 255 (1957) (plurality\nopinion); Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71, 84 (1902). That,\ntoo, is for the State to decide.\n   This Court, in determining the substance of state law, is\n“bound by a state court’s construction of a state statute.”\nWisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 483 (1993). And the\nSupreme Court of California, in response to the certified\nquestion submitted to it in this case, has determined that\nState Elections Code provisions directed to initiative\nproponents do inform and instruct state law respecting the\nrights and status of proponents in postelection judicial\nproceedings. Here, in reliance on these statutes and the\nCalifornia Constitution, the State Supreme Court has held\nthat proponents do have authority “under California law\nto appear and assert the state’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity and appeal a judgment invalidating the measure\nwhen the public officials who ordinarily defend the meas-\nure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.” Perry\nv.

As a class, official proponents are\na small, identifiable group. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann.\n§9001(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2013). Because many of their\ndecisions must be unanimous, see §§9001(b)(1), 9002(b),\nthey are necessarily few in number. Their identities\nare public. §9001(b)(2). Their commitment is substantial.\nSee §§9607–9609 (West Cum. Supp. 2013) (obtaining pe-\ntition signatures); §9001(c) (monetary fee); §§9065(d),\n9067, 9069 (West 2003) (drafting arguments for official\nballot pamphlet). They know and understand the purpose\nand operation of the proposed law, an important requisite\nin defending initiatives on complex matters such as taxa-\ntion and insurance. Having gone to great lengths to con-\nvince voters to enact an initiative, they have a stake in the\noutcome and the necessary commitment to provide zealous\nadvocacy.\n   Thus, in California, proponents play a “unique role . . .\nin the initiative process.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1024. They “have a unique relationship to the voter-\napproved measure that makes them especially likely to be\nreliable and vigorous advocates for the measure and to\nbe so viewed by those whose votes secured the initiative’s\nenactment into law.” Ibid.; see also id., at 1160, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1030 (because of “their special relationship to the ini-\ntiative measure,” proponents are “the most obvious and\nlogical private individuals to ably and vigorously defend\nthe validity of the challenged measure on behalf of the\ninterests of the voters who adopted the initiative into\nlaw”). Proponents’ authority under state law is not a\ncontrivance. It is not a fictional construct. It is the prod-\nuct of the California Constitution and the California Elec-\ntions Code.

The Alaska Supreme\nCourt reached a similar unanimous result in Alaskans\nfor a Common Language Inc., v. Kritz, 3 P. 3d 906 (2000).\nIt noted that, except in extraordinary cases, “a sponsor’s\ndirect interest in legislation enacted through the initiative\nprocess and the concomitant need to avoid the appearance\nof [a conflict of interest] will ordinarily preclude courts\nfrom denying intervention as of right to a sponsoring group.”\nId., at 914.\n   For these and other reasons, the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia held that the California Elections Code and\nArticle II, §8, of the California Constitution afford propo-\nnents “the authority . . . to assert the state’s interest in the\nvalidity of the initiative” when State officials decline to do\nso. 52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P. 3d, at 1024. The court\nrepeated this unanimous holding more than a half-dozen\ntimes and in no uncertain terms. See id., at 1126, 1127,\n1139, 1149, 1151, 1152, 1165, 256 P. 3d, at 1006, 1007,\n1015, 1022, 1024, 1025, 1033; see also id., at 1169–1170,\n265 P. 3d, at 1036–1037 (Kennard, J., concurring). That\nshould suffice to resolve the central issue on which the\nfederal question turns.\n6                 HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   The Court concludes that proponents lack sufficient\nties to the state government. It notes that they “are not\nelected,” “answer to no one,” and lack “‘a fiduciary obligation’”\nto the State. Ante, at 15 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) of\nAgency §1.01, Comments e, f (2005)). But what the Court\ndeems deficiencies in the proponents’ connection to the\nState government, the State Supreme Court saw as essen-\ntial qualifications to defend the initiative system. The\nvery object of the initiative system is to establish a law-\nmaking process that does not depend upon state officials.\nIn California, the popular initiative is necessary to imple-\nment “the theory that all power of government ultimately\nresides in the people.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1140, 265 P. 3d, at\n1016 (internal quotation marks omitted). The right to\nadopt initiatives has been described by the California\ncourts as “one of the most precious rights of [the State’s]\ndemocratic process.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That historic role for the initiative system “grew\nout of dissatisfaction with the then governing public offi-\ncials and a widespread belief that the people had lost\ncontrol of the political process.” Ibid. The initiative’s\n“primary purpose,” then, “was to afford the people the\nability to propose and to adopt constitutional amendments\nor statutory provisions that their elected public officials\nhad refused or declined to adopt.” Ibid.\n   The California Supreme Court has determined that this\npurpose is undermined if the very officials the initiative\nprocess seeks to circumvent are the only parties who can\ndefend an enacted initiative when it is challenged in a\nlegal proceeding. See id., at 1160, 265 P. 3d, at 1030; cf.\nAlaskans for a Common Language, supra, at 914 (noting\nthat proponents must be allowed to defend an enacted\ninitiative in order to avoid the perception, correct or\nnot, “that the interests of [the proponents] were not being\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ndefended vigorously by the executive branch”). Giving the\nGovernor and attorney general this de facto veto will erode\none of the cornerstones of the State’s governmental struc-\nture. See 52 Cal. 4th, at 1126–1128, 265 P. 3d, at 1006–\n1007. And in light of the frequency with which initiatives’\nopponents resort to litigation, the impact of that veto\ncould be substantial. K. Miller, Direct Democracy and the\nCourts 106 (2009) (185 of the 455 initiatives approved in\nArizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington\nbetween 1900 and 2008 were challenged in court). As a\nconsequence, California finds it necessary to vest the re-\nsponsibility and right to defend a voter-approved initiative\nin the initiative’s proponents when the State Executive\ndeclines to do so.\n   Yet today the Court demands that the State follow the\nRestatement of Agency. See ante, at 15–16. There are\nreasons, however, why California might conclude that a\nconventional agency relationship is inconsistent with the\nhistory, design, and purpose of the initiative process. The\nState may not wish to associate itself with proponents or\ntheir views outside of the “extremely narrow and limited”\ncontext of this litigation, 52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P. 3d, at\n1029, or to bear the cost of proponents’ legal fees. The\nState may also wish to avoid the odd conflict of having a\nformal agent of the State (the initiative’s proponent) argu-\ning in favor of a law’s validity while state officials (e.g., the\nattorney general) contend in the same proceeding that it\nshould be found invalid.\n   Furthermore, it is not clear who the principal in an\nagency relationship would be. It would make little sense if\nit were the Governor or attorney general, for that would\nfrustrate the initiative system’s purpose of circumventing\nelected officials who fail or refuse to effect the public will.\nId., at 1139–1140, 265 P. 3d, at 1016. If there is to be a\nprincipal, then, it must be the people of California, as the\nultimate sovereign in the State. See ibid., 265 P. 3d, at\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n1015–1016 (quoting Cal. Const., Art. II, §1) (“ ‘All political\npower is inherent in the people’ ”). But the Restatement\nmay offer no workable example of an agent representing\na principal composed of nearly 40 million residents of a\nState. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency, p. 2, Scope\nNote (1957) (noting that the Restatement “does not state\nthe special rules applicable to public officers”); 1 Restate-\nment (First) of Agency, p. 4, Scope Note (1933) (same).\n   And if the Court’s concern is that the proponents are\nunaccountable, that fear is neither well founded nor suf-\nficient to overcome the contrary judgment of the State\nSupreme Court. It must be remembered that both elected\nofficials and initiative proponents receive their authority\nto speak for the State of California directly from the peo-\nple. The Court apparently believes that elected officials\nare acceptable “agents” of the State, see ante, at 11–12,\nbut they are no more subject to ongoing supervision of\ntheir principal—i.e., the people of the State—than are\ninitiative proponents. At most, a Governor or attorney\ngeneral can be recalled or voted out of office in a subse-\nquent election, but proponents, too, can have their authority\nterminated or their initiative overridden by a subsequent\nballot measure. Finally, proponents and their attor-\nneys, like all other litigants and counsel who appear before\na federal court, are subject to duties of candor, deco-\nrum, and respect for the tribunal and co-parties alike, all\nof which guard against the possibility that initiative pro-\nponents will somehow fall short of the appropriate stan-\ndards for federal litigation.\n                            B\n  Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, this Court’s prece-\ndents do not indicate that a formal agency relationship is\nnecessary. In Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72 (1987), the\nSpeaker of the New Jersey Assembly (Karcher) and Presi-\ndent of the New Jersey Senate (Orechio) intervened in\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsupport of a school moment-of-silence law that the State’s\nGovernor and attorney general declined to defend in court.\nIn considering the question of standing, the Court looked\nto New Jersey law to determine whether Karcher and\nOrechio “had authority under state law to represent the\nState’s interest in both the District Court and Court of\nAppeals.” Id., at 82. The Court concluded that they did.\nBecause the “New Jersey Supreme Court ha[d] granted\napplications of the Speaker of the General Assembly and\nthe President of the Senate to intervene as parties-\nrespondent on behalf of the legislature in defense of a\nlegislative enactment,” the Karcher Court held that stand-\ning had been proper in the District Court and Court of\nAppeals. Ibid. By the time the case arrived in this Court,\nKarcher and Orechio had lost their presiding legislative\noffices, without which they lacked the authority to repre-\nsent the State under New Jersey law. This, the Court\nheld, deprived them of standing. Id., at 81. Here, by\ncontrast, proponents’ authority under California law is not\ncontingent on officeholder status, so their standing is\nunaffected by the fact that they “hold no office” in Califor-\nnia’s Government. Ante, at 12.\n  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43\n(1997), is consistent with the premises of this dissent, not\nwith the rationale of the Court’s opinion. See ante, at 13–\n14. There, the Court noted its serious doubts as to the\naspiring defenders’ standing because there was “no Ari-\nzona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the\npeople of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the\nconstitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.”\n520 U. S., at 65. The Court did use the word “agents”; but,\nread in context, it is evident that the Court’s intention was\nnot to demand a formal agency relationship in compliance\nwith the Restatement. Rather, the Court used the term\nas shorthand for a party whom “state law authorizes” to\n“represent the State’s interests” in court. Ibid.\n10               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   Both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia were mindful of these precedents and sought to\ncomply with them. The state court, noting the importance\nof Arizonans for Official English, expressed its under-\nstanding that “the high court’s doubts as to the official\ninitiative proponents’ standing in that case were based, at\nleast in substantial part, on the fact that the court was not\naware of any ‘Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors\nas agents of the people of Arizona to defend . . . the consti-\ntutionality of initiatives made law of the State.’ ” 52 Cal.\n4th, at 1136–1137, 265 P. 3d, at 1013–1014 (quoting 520\nU. S., at 65). Based on this passage, it concluded that\n“nothing in [Arizonans for Official English] indicates that\nif a state’s law does authorize the official proponents of an\ninitiative to assert the state’s interest in the validity of a\nchallenged state initiative when the public officials who\nordinarily assert that interest have declined to do so, the\nproponents would not have standing to assert the state’s\ninterest in the initiative’s validity in a federal lawsuit.”\nId., at 1137, 265 P. 3d, at 1014.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, was mindful of this require-\nment. Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3d 1052, 1072–1073 (CA9\n2012). Although that panel divided on the proper resolu-\ntion of the merits of this case, it was unanimous in con-\ncluding that proponents satisfy the requirements of Article\nIII. Compare id., at 1070–1075 (majority opinion), with\nid., at 1096–1097 (N. R. Smith, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). Its central premise, ignored by the\nCourt today, was that the “State’s highest court [had] held\nthat California law provides precisely what the Arizonans\nCourt found lacking in Arizona law: it confers on the\nofficial proponents of an initiative the authority to assert\nthe State’s interests in defending the constitutionality of\nthat initiative, where state officials who would ordinarily\nassume that responsibility choose not to do so.” Id., at\n1072 (majority opinion). The Court of Appeals and the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nState Supreme Court did not ignore Arizonans for Official\nEnglish; they were faithful to it.\n                               C\n   The Court’s approach in this case is also in tension with\nother cases in which the Court has permitted individuals\nto assert claims on behalf of the government or others.\nFor instance, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a)(2)\nallows a court to appoint a private attorney to investigate\nand prosecute potential instances of criminal contempt.\nUnder the Rule, this special prosecutor is not the agent of\nthe appointing judge; indeed, the prosecutor’s “determina-\ntion of which persons should be targets of the investiga-\ntion, what methods of investigation should be used, what\ninformation will be sought as evidence,” whom to charge,\nand other “decisions . . . critical to the conduct of a prose-\ncution, are all made outside the supervision of the court.”\nYoung v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481\nU. S. 787, 807 (1987). Also, just as proponents have been\nauthorized to represent the State of California, “ ‘[p]rivate\nattorneys appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt\naction represent the United States,’ ” United States v. Prov-\nidence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693, 700 (1988). They are\n“appointed solely to pursue the public interest in vindica-\ntion of the court’s authority,” Young, supra, at 804, an\ninterest that—like California’s interest in the validity of\nits laws—is “unique to the sovereign,” Providence Journal\nCo., supra, at 700. And, although the Court dismisses the\nproponents’ standing claim because initiative proponents\n“are not elected” and “decide for themselves, with no re-\nview, what arguments to make and how to make them” in\ndefense of the enacted initiative, ante, at 15, those same\ncharges could be leveled with equal if not greater force at\nthe special prosecutors just discussed. See Young, supra,\nat 807.\n   Similar questions might also arise regarding qui tam\n12               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nactions, see, e.g., Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v.\nUnited States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 771–778\n(2000); suits involving “next friends” litigating on behalf of\na real party in interest, see, e.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas,\n495 U. S. 149, 161–166 (1990); or shareholder-derivative\nsuits, see, e.g., Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U. S. 115, 125–126\n(1991). There is no more of an agency relationship in any\nof these settings than in the instant case, yet the Court\nhas nonetheless permitted a party to assert the interests\nof another. That qui tam actions and “next friend” litiga-\ntion may have a longer historical pedigree than the initia-\ntive process, see ante, at 12–13, is no basis for finding\nArticle III’s standing requirement met in those cases\nbut lacking here. In short, the Court today unsettles its\nlongtime understanding of the basis for jurisdiction in\nrepresentative-party litigation, leaving the law unclear and\nthe District Court’s judgment, and its accompanying state-\nwide injunction, effectively immune from appellate review.\n                              III\n   There is much irony in the Court’s approach to justicia-\nbility in this case. A prime purpose of justiciability is to\nensure vigorous advocacy, yet the Court insists upon\nlitigation conducted by state officials whose preference is\nto lose the case. The doctrine is meant to ensure that\ncourts are responsible and constrained in their power, but\nthe Court’s opinion today means that a single district\ncourt can make a decision with far-reaching effects that\ncannot be reviewed. And rather than honor the principle\nthat justiciability exists to allow disputes of public policy\nto be resolved by the political process rather than the\ncourts, see, e.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750–752\n(1984), here the Court refuses to allow a State’s authorized\nrepresentatives to defend the outcome of a democratic\nelection.\n   The Court’s opinion disrespects and disparages both the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npolitical process in California and the well-stated opinion\nof the California Supreme Court in this case. The Califor-\nnia Supreme Court, not this Court, expresses concern for\nvigorous representation; the California Supreme Court,\nnot this Court, recognizes the necessity to avoid conflicts\nof interest; the California Supreme Court, not this Court,\ncomprehends the real interest at stake in this litigation\nand identifies the most proper party to defend that inter-\nest. The California Supreme Court’s opinion reflects a\nbetter understanding of the dynamics and principles of\nArticle III than does this Court’s opinion.\n   Of course, the Court must be cautious before entering a\nrealm of controversy where the legal community and\nsociety at large are still formulating ideas and approaches\nto a most difficult subject. But it is shortsighted to mis-\nconstrue principles of justiciability to avoid that subject.\nAs the California Supreme Court recognized, “the question\nbefore us involves a fundamental procedural issue that\nmay arise with respect to any initiative measure, without\nregard to its subject matter.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265\nP. 3d, at 1005 (emphasis in original). If a federal court\nmust rule on a constitutional point that either confirms or\nrejects the will of the people expressed in an initiative,\nthat is when it is most necessary, not least necessary, to\ninsist on rules that ensure the most committed and vigor-\nous adversary arguments to inform the rulings of the\ncourts.\n                        *     *    *\n  In the end, what the Court fails to grasp or accept is the\nbasic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The\nessence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in\nthe people and flows to the government, not the other way\naround. Freedom resides first in the people without need\nof a grant from government. The California initiative\nprocess embodies these principles and has done so for over\n14              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\na century. “Through the structure of its government, and\nthe character of those who exercise government authority,\na State defines itself as sovereign.” Gregory v. Ashcroft,\n501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991). In California and the 26 other\nStates that permit initiatives and popular referendums,\nthe people have exercised their own inherent sovereign\nright to govern themselves. The Court today frustrates\nthat choice by nullifying, for failure to comply with the\nRestatement of Agency, a State Supreme Court decision\nholding that state law authorizes an enacted initiative’s\nproponents to defend the law if and when the State’s usual\nlegal advocates decline to do so. The Court’s opinion fails\nto abide by precedent and misapplies basic principles\nof justiciability. Those errors necessitate this respectful\ndissent.\n</pre>", "id": 932061, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2013/06/26/hollingsworth_v._perry.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2012                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued March 26, 2013—Decided June 26, 2013\nAfter the California Supreme Court held that limiting marriage to op-\n  posite-sex couples violated the California Constitution, state voters\n  passed a ballot initiative known as Proposition 8, amending the State\n  Constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a\n  woman. Respondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, filed suit\n  in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under the Due Process and\n  Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and naming\n  as defendants California’s Governor and other state and local officials\n  responsible for enforcing California’s marriage laws. The officials re-\n  fused to defend the law, so the District Court allowed petitioners—\n  the initiative’s official proponents—to intervene to defend it. After a\n  bench trial, the court declared Proposition 8 unconstitutional and en-\n  joined the public officials named as defendants from enforcing the\n  law. Those officials elected not to appeal, but petitioners did. The\n  Ninth Circuit certified a question to the California Supreme Court:\n  whether official proponents of a ballot initiative have authority to as-\n  sert the State’s interest in defending the constitutionality of the ini-\n  tiative when public officials refuse to do so. After the California Su-\n  preme Court answered in the affirmative, the Ninth Circuit\n  concluded that petitioners had standing under federal law to defend\n  Proposition 8’s constitutionality. On the merits, the court affirmed\n  the District Court’s order.\nHeld: Petitioners did not have standing to appeal the District Court’s\n order. Pp. 5–17.\n    (a) Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of fed-\n eral courts to deciding actual “Cases” or “Controversies.” §2. One es-\n sential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the\n power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. In oth-\n2                      HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    er words, the litigant must seek a remedy for a personal and tangible\n    harm. Although most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has\n    satisfied the requirement when filing suit, Article III demands that\n    an “actual controversy” persist throughout all stages of litigation. Al-\n    ready, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U. S. ___, ___. Standing “must be met\n    by persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by per-\n    sons appearing in courts of first instance.” Arizonans for Official\n    English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64. The parties do not contest that\n    respondents had standing to initiate this case against the California\n    officials responsible for enforcing Proposition 8. But once the District\n    Court issued its order, respondents no longer had any injury to re-\n    dress, and the state officials chose not to appeal. The only individu-\n    als who sought to appeal were petitioners, who had intervened in the\n    District Court, but they had not been ordered to do or refrain from\n    doing anything. Their only interest was to vindicate the constitu-\n    tional validity of a generally applicable California law. As this Court\n    has repeatedly held, such a “generalized grievance”—no matter how\n    sincere—is insufficient to confer standing. See Lujan v. Defenders of\n    Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 573–574. Petitioners claim that the Califor-\n    nia Constitution and election laws give them a “ ‘unique,’ ‘special,’\n    and ‘distinct’ role in the initiative process,” Reply Brief 5, but that is\n    only true during the process of enacting the law. Once Proposition 8\n    was approved, it became a duly enacted constitutional amendment.\n    Petitioners have no role—special or otherwise—in its enforcement.\n    They therefore have no “personal stake” in defending its enforcement\n    that is distinguishable from the general interest of every California\n    citizen. No matter how deeply committed petitioners may be to up-\n    holding Proposition 8, that is not a particularized interest sufficient\n    to create a case or controversy under Article III. Pp. 5–9.\n       (b) Petitioners’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 9–\n    16.\n         (1) They claim that they may assert the State’s interest on the\n    State’s behalf, but it is a “fundamental restriction on our authority”\n    that “[i]n the ordinary course, a litigant . . . cannot rest a claim to re-\n    lief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.” Powers v. Ohio,\n    499 U. S. 400, 410. In Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, for example,\n    a pediatrician engaged in private practice was not permitted to de-\n    fend the constitutionality of Illinois’ abortion law after the State\n    chose not to appeal an adverse ruling. The state attorney general’s\n    “letter of interest,” explaining that the State’s interest in the proceed-\n    ing was “ ‘essentially co-terminous with’ ” Diamond’s position, id., at\n    61, was insufficient, since Diamond was unable to assert an injury of\n    his own, id, at 65. Pp. 9–10.\n         (2) Petitioners contend the California Supreme Court’s determi-\n                    Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                        3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\nnation that they were authorized under California law to assert the\nState’s interest in the validity of Proposition 8 means that they “need\nno more show a personal injury, separate from the State’s indisputa-\nble interest in the validity of its law, than would California’s Attor-\nney General or did the legislative leaders held to have standing in\nKarcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72 (1987).” Reply Brief 6. But far from\nsupporting petitioners’ standing, Karcher is compelling precedent\nagainst it. In that case, after the New Jersey attorney general re-\nfused to defend the constitutionality of a state law, leaders of New\nJersey’s Legislature were permitted to appear, in their official capaci-\nties, in the District Court and Court of Appeals to defend the law.\nWhat is significant about Karcher, however, is what happened after\nthe Court of Appeals decision. The legislators lost their leadership\npositions, but nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court. The Court\nheld that they could not do so. Although they could participate in the\nlawsuit in their official capacities as presiding officers of the legisla-\nture, as soon as they lost that capacity, they lost standing. Id., at 81.\nPetitioners here hold no office and have always participated in this\nlitigation solely as private parties. Pp. 10–13.\n     (3) Nor is support found in dicta in Arizonans for Official English\nv. Arizona, supra. There, in expressing “grave doubts” about the\nstanding of ballot initiative sponsors to defend the constitutionality of\nan Arizona initiative, the Court noted that it was “aware of no Arizo-\nna law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Ari-\nzona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality of initi-\natives made law of the State.” Id., at 65. Petitioners argue that, by\nvirtue of the California Supreme Court’s decision, they are authorized\nto act as “agents of the people of California.” Brief for Petitioners 15.\nBut that Court never described petitioners as “agents of the people.”\nAll the California Supreme Court’s decision stands for is that, so far\nas California is concerned, petitioners may “assert legal arguments in\ndefense of the state’s interest in the validity of the initiative meas-\nure” in federal court. 628 F. 3d 1191, 1193. That interest is by defi-\nnition a generalized one, and it is precisely because proponents assert\nsuch an interest that they lack standing under this Court’s prece-\ndents. Petitioners are also plainly not agents of the State. As an ini-\ntial matter, petitioners’ newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with\ntheir representations to the District Court, where they claimed to\nrepresent their own interests as official proponents. More to the\npoint, the basic features of an agency relationship are missing here:\nPetitioners are not subject to the control of any principal, and they\nowe no fiduciary obligation to anyone. As one amicus puts it, “the\nproponents apparently have an unelected appointment for an unspec-\nified period of time as defenders of the initiative, however and to\n4                      HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    whatever extent they choose to defend it.” Brief for Walter Dellinger\n    23. Pp. 13–16.\n      (c) The Court does not question California’s sovereign right to\n    maintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative proponents to\n    defend their initiatives in California courts. But standing in federal\n    court is a question of federal law, not state law. No matter its rea-\n    sons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should have stand-\n    ing to seek relief for a generalized grievance cannot override this\n    Court’s settled law to the contrary. Article III’s requirement that a\n    party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court seek relief for a per-\n    sonal, particularized injury serves vital interests going to the role of\n    the Judiciary in the federal system of separated powers. States can-\n    not alter that role simply by issuing to private parties who otherwise\n    lack standing a ticket to the federal courthouse.

That question has also given rise to litigation.\nIn this case, petitioners, who oppose same-sex marriage,\nask us to decide whether the Equal Protection Clause\n“prohibits the State of California from defining marriage\nas the union of a man and a woman.” Pet. for Cert. i.\nRespondents, same-sex couples who wish to marry, view\nthe issue in somewhat different terms: For them, it is\nwhether California—having previously recognized the\nright of same-sex couples to marry—may reverse that\ndecision through a referendum.\n  Federal courts have authority under the Constitution to\nanswer such questions only if necessary to do so in the\ncourse of deciding an actual “case” or “controversy.” As\nused in the Constitution, those words do not include every\nsort of dispute, but only those “historically viewed as\ncapable of resolution through the judicial process.” Flast\nv. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 95 (1968). This is an essential\n2                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nlimit on our power: It ensures that we act as judges, and\ndo not engage in policymaking properly left to elected\nrepresentatives.\n  For there to be such a case or controversy, it is not\nenough that the party invoking the power of the court\nhave a keen interest in the issue. That party must also\nhave “standing,” which requires, among other things, that\nit have suffered a concrete and particularized injury.\nBecause we find that petitioners do not have standing, we\nhave no authority to decide this case on the merits, and\nneither did the Ninth Circuit.\n                               I\n   In 2008, the California Supreme Court held that limit-\ning the official designation of marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the Califor-\nnia Constitution. In re Marriage Cases, 43 Cal. 4th 757,\n183 P. 3d 384. Later that year, California voters passed\nthe ballot initiative at the center of this dispute, known as\nProposition 8. That proposition amended the California\nConstitution to provide that “[o]nly marriage between a\nman and a woman is valid or recognized in California.”\nCal. Const., Art. I, §7.5. Shortly thereafter, the California\nSupreme Court rejected a procedural challenge to the\namendment, and held that the Proposition was properly\nenacted under California law. Strauss v. Horton, 46 Cal.\n4th 364, 474–475, 207 P. 3d 48, 122 (2009).\n   According to the California Supreme Court, Proposition\n8 created a “narrow and limited exception” to the state\nconstitutional rights otherwise guaranteed to same-sex\ncouples. Id., at 388, 207 P. 3d, at 61. Under California\nlaw, same-sex couples have a right to enter into relation-\nships recognized by the State as “domestic partnerships,”\nwhich carry “the same rights, protections, and benefits,\nand shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obliga-\ntions, and duties under law . . . as are granted to and\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nimposed upon spouses.” Cal. Fam. Code Ann. §297.5(a)\n(West 2004). In In re Marriage Cases, the California\nSupreme Court concluded that the California Constitution\nfurther guarantees same-sex couples “all of the constitu-\ntionally based incidents of marriage,” including the right\nto have that marriage “officially recognized” as such by the\nState. 43 Cal. 4th, at 829, 183 P. 3d, at 433–434. Proposi-\ntion 8, the court explained in Strauss, left those rights\nlargely undisturbed, reserving only “the official designa-\ntion of the term ‘marriage’ for the union of opposite-sex\ncouples as a matter of state constitutional law.” 46 Cal.\n4th, at 388, 207 P. 3d, at 61.\n   Respondents, two same-sex couples who wish to marry,\nfiled suit in federal court, challenging Proposition 8 under\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The\ncomplaint named as defendants California’s Governor,\nattorney general, and various other state and local offi-\ncials responsible for enforcing California’s marriage laws.\nThose officials refused to defend the law, although they\nhave continued to enforce it throughout this litigation.\nThe District Court allowed petitioners—the official propo-\nnents of the initiative, see Cal. Elec. Code Ann. §342 (West\n2003)—to intervene to defend it. After a 12-day bench\ntrial, the District Court declared Proposition 8 uncon-\nstitutional, permanently enjoining the California officials\nnamed as defendants from enforcing the law, and “direct-\ning the official defendants that all persons under their\ncontrol or supervision” shall not enforce it. Perry v.\nSchwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 1004 (ND Cal.\n2010).\n   Those officials elected not to appeal the District Court\norder. When petitioners did, the Ninth Circuit asked\nthem to address “why this appeal should not be dismissed\nfor lack of Article III standing.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger,\nCiv. No. 10–16696 (CA9, Aug. 16, 2010), p. 2. After brief-\n4                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ning and argument, the Ninth Circuit certified a question to\nthe California Supreme Court:\n    “Whether under Article II, Section 8 of the California\n    Constitution, or otherwise under California law, the\n    official proponents of an initiative measure possess\n    either a particularized interest in the initiative’s valid-\n    ity or the authority to assert the State’s interest in the\n    initiative’s validity, which would enable them to de-\n    fend the constitutionality of the initiative upon its\n    adoption or appeal a judgment invalidating the initia-\n    tive, when the public officials charged with that duty\n    refuse to do so.” Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 628 F. 3d\n    1191, 1193 (2011).\n   The California Supreme Court agreed to decide the\ncertified question, and answered in the affirmative. With-\nout addressing whether the proponents have a particular-\nized interest of their own in an initiative’s validity, the\ncourt concluded that “[i]n a postelection challenge to a\nvoter-approved initiative measure, the official proponents\nof the initiative are authorized under California law to\nappear and assert the state’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity and to appeal a judgment invalidating the meas-\nure when the public officials who ordinarily defend the\nmeasure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.”\nPerry v. Brown, 52 Cal. 4th 1116, 1127, 265 P. 3d 1002,\n1007 (2011).\n   Relying on that answer, the Ninth Circuit concluded\nthat petitioners had standing under federal law to defend\nthe constitutionality of Proposition 8. California, it rea-\nsoned, “ ‘has standing to defend the constitutionality of its\n[laws],’ ” and States have the “prerogative, as independent\nsovereigns, to decide for themselves who may assert their\ninterests.” Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3d 1052, 1070, 1071\n(2012) (quoting Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54, 62\n(1986)). “All a federal court need determine is that the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nstate has suffered a harm sufficient to confer standing and\nthat the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt is authorized by the state to represent its interest in\nremedying that harm.” 671 F. 3d, at 1072.\n   On the merits, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt. The court held the Proposition unconstitutional\nunder the rationale of our decision in Romer v. Evans, 517\nU. S. 620 (1996). 671 F. 3d, at 1076, 1095. In the Ninth\nCircuit’s view, Romer stands for the proposition that “the\nEqual Protection Clause requires the state to have a legit-\nimate reason for withdrawing a right or benefit from one\ngroup but not others, whether or not it was required to\nconfer that right or benefit in the first place.” 671 F. 3d, at\n1083–1084. The Ninth Circuit concluded that “taking\naway the official designation” of “marriage” from same-sex\ncouples, while continuing to afford those couples all the\nrights and obligations of marriage, did not further any\nlegitimate interest of the State. Id., at 1095. Proposition\n8, in the court’s view, violated the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause it served no purpose “but to impose on gays and\nlesbians, through the public law, a majority’s private\ndisapproval of them and their relationships.” Ibid.\n   We granted certiorari to review that determination, and\ndirected that the parties also brief and argue “Whether\npetitioners have standing under Article III, §2, of the\nConstitution in this case.” 568 U. S. ___ (2012).\n                              II\n  Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power\nof federal courts to deciding actual “Cases” or “Controver-\nsies.” §2. One essential aspect of this requirement is that\nany person invoking the power of a federal court must\ndemonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant\nto prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized\ninjury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct,\nand is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial deci-\n6                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsion. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–\n561 (1992). In other words, for a federal court to have\nauthority under the Constitution to settle a dispute, the\nparty before it must seek a remedy for a personal and\ntangible harm. “The presence of a disagreement, however\nsharp and acrimonious it may be, is insufficient by itself to\nmeet Art. III’s requirements.” Diamond, supra, at 62.\n   The doctrine of standing, we recently explained, “serves\nto prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp\nthe powers of the political branches.” Clapper v. Amnesty\nInt’l USA, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9). In light\nof this “overriding and time-honored concern about keep-\ning the Judiciary’s power within its proper constitu-\ntional sphere, we must put aside the natural urge to\nproceed directly to the merits of [an] important dispute\nand to ‘settle’ it for the sake of convenience and effi-\nciency.” Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 820 (1997) (footnote\nomitted).\n   Most standing cases consider whether a plaintiff has\nsatisfied the requirement when filing suit, but Article III\ndemands that an “actual controversy” persist throughout\nall stages of litigation. Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). That means that standing “must be met\nby persons seeking appellate review, just as it must be\nmet by persons appearing in courts of first instance.”\nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 64\n(1997). We therefore must decide whether petitioners had\nstanding to appeal the District Court’s order.\n   Respondents initiated this case in the District Court\nagainst the California officials responsible for enforcing\nProposition 8. The parties do not contest that respondents\nhad Article III standing to do so. Each couple expressed a\ndesire to marry and obtain “official sanction” from the\nState, which was unavailable to them given the declara-\ntion in Proposition 8 that “marriage” in California is solely\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

App. 59.\n  After the District Court declared Proposition 8 unconsti-\ntutional and enjoined the state officials named as defend-\nants from enforcing it, however, the inquiry under Article\nIII changed. Respondents no longer had any injury to\nredress—they had won—and the state officials chose not\nto appeal.\n  The only individuals who sought to appeal that order\nwere petitioners, who had intervened in the District\nCourt. But the District Court had not ordered them to do\nor refrain from doing anything. To have standing, a liti-\ngant must seek relief for an injury that affects him in\na “personal and individual way.” Defenders of Wildlife,\nsupra, at 560, n. 1. He must possess a “direct stake in\nthe outcome” of the case. Arizonans for Official English,\nsupra, at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here,\nhowever, petitioners had no “direct stake” in the outcome\nof their appeal. Their only interest in having the District\nCourt order reversed was to vindicate the constitutional\nvalidity of a generally applicable California law.\n  We have repeatedly held that such a “generalized griev-\nance,” no matter how sincere, is insufficient to confer\nstanding. A litigant “raising only a generally available\ngrievance about government—claiming only harm to his\nand every citizen’s interest in proper application of the\nConstitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more\ndirectly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public\nat large—does not state an Article III case or controversy.”\nDefenders of Wildlife, supra, at 573–574; see Lance v.\nCoffman, 549 U. S. 437, 439 (2007) (per curiam) (“Our\nrefusal to serve as a forum for generalized grievances has\na lengthy pedigree.”); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 754\n(1984) (“an asserted right to have the Government act in\naccordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to\nconfer jurisdiction on a federal court”); Massachusetts v.\nMellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923) (“The party who invokes\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v.

True enough—but only when it comes to the pro-\ncess of enacting the law. Upon submitting the proposed\ninitiative to the attorney general, petitioners became the\nofficial “proponents” of Proposition 8. Cal. Elec. Code Ann.\n§342 (West 2003). As such, they were responsible for\ncollecting the signatures required to qualify the measure\nfor the ballot. §§9607–9609. After those signatures were\ncollected, the proponents alone had the right to file the\nmeasure with election officials to put it on the ballot.\n§9032. Petitioners also possessed control over the argu-\nments in favor of the initiative that would appear in Cali-\nfornia’s ballot pamphlets. §§9064, 9065, 9067, 9069.\n    But once Proposition 8 was approved by the voters, the\nmeasure became “a duly enacted constitutional amend-\nment or statute.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1147, 265 P. 3d, at 1021.\nPetitioners have no role—special or otherwise—in the\nenforcement of Proposition 8. See id., at 1159, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1029 (petitioners do not “possess any official authority\n. . . to directly enforce the initiative measure in question”).\nThey therefore have no “personal stake” in defending its\nenforcement that is distinguishable from the general\ninterest of every citizen of California. Defenders of Wild-\nlife, supra, at 560–561.\n    Article III standing “is not to be placed in the hands of\n‘concerned bystanders,’ who will use it simply as a ‘vehicle\nfor the vindication of value interests.’ ” Diamond, 476\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU. S., at 560, and n. 1; see Arizonans for Official English,\n520 U.

It is, however, a “fundamental restriction\non our authority” that “[i]n the ordinary course, a litigant\nmust assert his or her own legal rights and interests,\nand cannot rest a claim to relief on the legal rights or inter-\nests of third parties.” Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410\n(1991). There are “certain, limited exceptions” to that rule.\nIbid. But even when we have allowed litigants to assert\nthe interests of others, the litigants themselves still\n“must have suffered an injury in fact, thus giving [them] a\nsufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of the issue in\ndispute.” Id., at 411 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   In Diamond v. Charles, for example, we refused to allow\nDiamond, a pediatrician engaged in private practice in\nIllinois, to defend the constitutionality of the State’s abor-\ntion law. In that case, a group of physicians filed a con-\n10                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstitutional challenge to the Illinois statute in federal\ncourt. The State initially defended the law, and Diamond,\na professed “conscientious object[or] to abortions,” in-\ntervened to defend it alongside the State. 476 U. S., at\n57–58.\n    After the Seventh Circuit affirmed a permanent injunc-\ntion against enforcing several provisions of the law, the\nState chose not to pursue an appeal to this Court. But\nwhen Diamond did, the state attorney general filed a\n“ ‘letter of interest,’ ” explaining that the State’s interest in\nthe proceeding was “ ‘essentially co-terminous with the\nposition on the issues set forth by [Diamond].’ ” Id., at 61.\nThat was not enough, we held, to allow the appeal to\nproceed. As the Court explained, “[e]ven if there were cir-\ncumstances in which a private party would have stand-\ning to defend the constitutionality of a challenged statute,\nthis [was] not one of them,” because Diamond was not able\nto assert an injury in fact of his own. Id., at 65 (footnote\nomitted). And without “any judicially cognizable interest,”\nDiamond could not “maintain the litigation abandoned by\nthe State.” Id., at 71.\n    For the reasons we have explained, petitioners have\nlikewise not suffered an injury in fact, and therefore would\nordinarily have no standing to assert the State’s interests.\n                             B\n  Petitioners contend that this case is different, because\nthe California Supreme Court has determined that they\nare “authorized under California law to appear and assert\nthe state’s interest” in the validity of Proposition 8. 52\nCal. 4th, at 1127, 265 P. 3d, at 1007. The court below\nagreed: “All a federal court need determine is that the\nstate has suffered a harm sufficient to confer standing and\nthat the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the\ncourt is authorized by the state to represent its interest in\nremedying that harm.” 671 F. 3d, at 1072. As petitioners\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nput it, they “need no more show a personal injury, sepa-\nrate from the State’s indisputable interest in the validity\nof its law, than would California’s Attorney General or did\nthe legislative leaders held to have standing in Karcher v.\nMay, 484 U. S. 72 (1987).” Reply Brief 6.\n   In Karcher, we held that two New Jersey state legis-\nlators—Speaker of the General Assembly Alan Karcher\nand President of the Senate Carmen Orechio—could inter-\nvene in a suit against the State to defend the constitutionality\nof a New Jersey law, after the New Jersey attorney gen-\neral had declined to do so. 484 U. S., at 75, 81–82. “Since\nthe New Jersey Legislature had authority under state law\nto represent the State’s interests in both the District Court\nand the Court of Appeals,” we held that the Speaker and\nthe President, in their official capacities, could vindicate\nthat interest in federal court on the legislature’s behalf.\nId., at 82.\n   Far from supporting petitioners’ standing, however,\nKarcher is compelling precedent against it. The legislators\nin that case intervened in their official capacities as\nSpeaker and President of the legislature. No one doubts\nthat a State has a cognizable interest “in the continued\nenforceability” of its laws that is harmed by a judicial\ndecision declaring a state law unconstitutional. Maine v.\nTaylor, 477 U. S. 131, 137 (1986). To vindicate that inter-\nest or any other, a State must be able to designate agents\nto represent it in federal court. See Poindexter v. Green-\nhow, 114 U. S. 270, 288 (1885) (“The State is a political\ncorporate body [that] can act only through agents”). That\nagent is typically the State’s attorney general. But state\nlaw may provide for other officials to speak for the State in\nfederal court, as New Jersey law did for the State’s presid-\ning legislative officers in Karcher. See 484 U. S., at 81–82.\n   What is significant about Karcher is what happened\nafter the Court of Appeals decision in that case. Karcher\nand Orechio lost their positions as Speaker and President,\n12              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbut nevertheless sought to appeal to this Court. We held\nthat they could not do so. We explained that while they\nwere able to participate in the lawsuit in their official\ncapacities as presiding officers of the incumbent legisla-\nture, “since they no longer hold those offices, they lack\nauthority to pursue this appeal.” Id., at 81.\n   The point of Karcher is not that a State could authorize\nprivate parties to represent its interests; Karcher and\nOrechio were permitted to proceed only because they were\nstate officers, acting in an official capacity. As soon as\nthey lost that capacity, they lost standing. Petitioners\nhere hold no office and have always participated in this\nlitigation solely as private parties.\n   The cases relied upon by the dissent, see post, at 11–12,\nprovide petitioners no more support. The dissent’s primary\nauthorities, in fact, do not discuss standing at all. See\nYoung v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481\nU. S. 787 (1987); United States v. Providence Journal Co.,\n485 U. S. 693 (1988). And none comes close to establish-\ning that mere authorization to represent a third party’s\ninterests is sufficient to confer Article III standing on\nprivate parties with no injury of their own.\n   The dissent highlights the discretion exercised by spe-\ncial prosecutors appointed by federal courts to pursue\ncontempt charges. See post, at 11 (citing Young, supra, at\n807). Such prosecutors do enjoy a degree of independence\nin carrying out their appointed role, but no one would\nsuppose that they are not subject to the ultimate au-\nthority of the court that appointed them. See also Prov-\nidence Journal, supra, at 698–707 (recognizing further\ncontrol exercised by the Solicitor General over special\nprosecutors).\n   The dissent’s remaining cases, which at least consider\nstanding, are readily distinguishable. See Vermont Agency\nof Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens,\n529 U. S. 765, 771–778 (2000) (justifying qui tam actions\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

Arizona, 520\nU. S. 43. The plaintiff in Arizonans for Official English\nfiled a constitutional challenge to an Arizona ballot initia-\ntive declaring English “ ‘the official language of the State\nof Arizona.’ ” Id., at 48. After the District Court declared\nthe initiative unconstitutional, Arizona’s Governor an-\nnounced that she would not pursue an appeal. Instead,\nthe principal sponsor of the ballot initiative—the Arizo-\nnans for Official English Committee—sought to defend the\nmeasure in the Ninth Circuit. Id., at 55–56, 58. Analogiz-\ning the sponsors to the Arizona Legislature, the Ninth\nCircuit held that the Committee was “qualified to defend\n[the initiative] on appeal,” and affirmed the District Court.\nId., at 58, 61.\n   Before finding the case mooted by other events, this\nCourt expressed “grave doubts” about the Ninth Circuit’s\nstanding analysis.      Id., at 66.      We reiterated that\n“[s]tanding to defend on appeal in the place of an original\ndefendant . . . demands that the litigant possess ‘a direct\n14               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstake in the outcome.’ ” Id., at 64 (quoting Diamond, 476\nU. S., at 62). We recognized that a legislator authorized\nby state law to represent the State’s interest may satisfy\nstanding requirements, as in Karcher, supra, at 82, but\nnoted that the Arizona committee and its members were\n“not elected representatives, and we [we]re aware of no\nArizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the\npeople of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the\nconstitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.”\nArizonans for Official English, supra, at 65.\n   Petitioners argue that, by virtue of the California Su-\npreme Court’s decision, they are authorized to act “ ‘as\nagents of the people’ of California.” Brief for Petitioners\n15 (quoting Arizonans for Official English, supra, at 65).\nBut that Court never described petitioners as “agents of\nthe people,” or of anyone else. Nor did the Ninth Circuit.\nThe Ninth Circuit asked—and the California Supreme\nCourt answered—only whether petitioners had “the au-\nthority to assert the State’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity.” 628 F. 3d, at 1193; 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265\nP. 3d, at 1005. All that the California Supreme Court\ndecision stands for is that, so far as California is con-\ncerned, petitioners may argue in defense of Proposition 8.\nThis “does not mean that the proponents become de facto\npublic officials”; the authority they enjoy is “simply the\nauthority to participate as parties in a court action and to\nassert legal arguments in defense of the state’s interest in\nthe validity of the initiative measure.” Id., at 1159, 265\nP. 3d, at 1029. That interest is by definition a generalized\none, and it is precisely because proponents assert such an\ninterest that they lack standing under our precedents.\n   And petitioners are plainly not agents of the State—\n“formal” or otherwise, see post, at 7. As an initial matter,\npetitioners’ newfound claim of agency is inconsistent with\ntheir representations to the District Court. When the\nproponents sought to intervene in this case, they did not\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           15\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npurport to be agents of California. They argued instead\nthat “no other party in this case w[ould] adequately rep-\nresent their interests as official proponents.” Motion to\nIntervene in No. 09–2292 (ND Cal.), p. 6 (emphasis\nadded). It was their “unique legal status” as official\nproponents—not an agency relationship with the people of\nCalifornia—that petitioners claimed “endow[ed] them with\na significantly protectable interest” in ensuring that the\nDistrict Court not “undo[ ] all that they ha[d] done in\nobtaining . . . enactment” of Proposition 8. Id., at 10, 11.\n    More to the point, the most basic features of an agency\nrelationship are missing here. Agency requires more than\nmere authorization to assert a particular interest. “An\nessential element of agency is the principal’s right to\ncontrol the agent’s actions.” 1 Restatement (Third) of\nAgency §1.01, Comment f (2005) (hereinafter Restate-\nment). Yet petitioners answer to no one; they decide for\nthemselves, with no review, what arguments to make and\nhow to make them. Unlike California’s attorney general,\nthey are not elected at regular intervals—or elected at all.\nSee Cal. Const., Art. V, §11. No provision provides for\ntheir removal. As one amicus explains, “the proponents\napparently have an unelected appointment for an unspeci-\nfied period of time as defenders of the initiative, however\nand to whatever extent they choose to defend it.” Brief for\nWalter Dellinger 23.\n    “If the relationship between two persons is one of agency\n. . . , the agent owes a fiduciary obligation to the princi-\npal.” 1 Restatement §1.01, Comment e. But petitioners\nowe nothing of the sort to the people of California. Unlike\nCalifornia’s elected officials, they have taken no oath of\noffice. E.g., Cal. Const., Art. XX, §3 (prescribing the oath\nfor “all public officers and employees, executive, legisla-\ntive, and judicial”). As the California Supreme Court\nexplained, petitioners are bound simply by “the same\nethical constraints that apply to all other parties in a legal\n16               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproceeding.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P. 3d, at 1029.\nThey are free to pursue a purely ideological commit-\nment to the law’s constitutionality without the need to\ntake cognizance of resource constraints, changes in\npublic opinion, or potential ramifications for other state\npriorities.\n   Finally, the California Supreme Court stated that “[t]he\nquestion of who should bear responsibility for any attorney\nfee award . . . is entirely distinct from the question” before\nit. Id., at 1161, 265 P. 3d, at 1031. (emphasis added). But\nit is hornbook law that “a principal has a duty to indem-\nnify the agent against expenses and other losses incurred\nby the agent in defending against actions brought by third\nparties if the agent acted with actual authority in taking\nthe action challenged by the third party’s suit.” 2 Re-\nstatement §8.14, Comment d. If the issue of fees is entirely\ndistinct from the authority question, then authority cannot\nbe based on agency.\n   Neither the California Supreme Court nor the Ninth\nCircuit ever described the proponents as agents of the\nState, and they plainly do not qualify as such.\n                              IV\n  The dissent eloquently recounts the California Supreme\nCourt’s reasons for deciding that state law authorizes\npetitioners to defend Proposition 8. See post, at 3–5. We\ndo not “disrespect[ ]” or “disparage[ ]” those reasons. Post,\nat 12. Nor do we question California’s sovereign right to\nmaintain an initiative process, or the right of initiative\nproponents to defend their initiatives in California courts,\nwhere Article III does not apply. But as the dissent\nacknowledges, see post, at 1, standing in federal court is a\nquestion of federal law, not state law. And no matter its\nreasons, the fact that a State thinks a private party should\nhave standing to seek relief for a generalized grievance\ncannot override our settled law to the contrary.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Proper resolution of the\njusticiability question requires, in this case, a threshold\ndetermination of state law. The state-law question is how\nCalifornia defines and elaborates the status and authority\nof an initiative’s proponents who seek to intervene in court\nto defend the initiative after its adoption by the electorate.\nThose state-law issues have been addressed in a metic-\nulous and unanimous opinion by the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia.\n   Under California law, a proponent has the authority to\nappear in court and assert the State’s interest in defend-\ning an enacted initiative when the public officials charged\nwith that duty refuse to do so. The State deems such an\nappearance essential to the integrity of its initiative pro-\ncess. Yet the Court today concludes that this state-defined\nstatus and this state-conferred right fall short of meeting\nfederal requirements because the proponents cannot point\nto a formal delegation of authority that tracks the re-\nquirements of the Restatement of Agency. But the State\nSupreme Court’s definition of proponents’ powers is bind-\n2                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ning on this Court. And that definition is fully sufficient to\nestablish the standing and adversity that are requisites\nfor justiciability under Article III of the United States\nConstitution.\n   In my view Article III does not require California, when\ndeciding who may appear in court to defend an initiative\non its behalf, to comply with the Restatement of Agency or\nwith this Court’s view of how a State should make its laws\nor structure its government. The Court’s reasoning does\nnot take into account the fundamental principles or the\npractical dynamics of the initiative system in California,\nwhich uses this mechanism to control and to bypass pub-\nlic officials—the same officials who would not defend the\ninitiative, an injury the Court now leaves unremedied.\nThe Court’s decision also has implications for the 26 other\nStates that use an initiative or popular referendum sys-\ntem and which, like California, may choose to have initia-\ntive proponents stand in for the State when public officials\ndecline to defend an initiative in litigation. See M. Waters,\nInitiative and Referendum Almanac 12 (2003). In my sub-\nmission, the Article III requirement for a justiciable case\nor controversy does not prevent proponents from having\ntheir day in court.\n   These are the premises for this respectful dissent.\n                               I\n  As the Court explains, the State of California sustained\na concrete injury, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of\nArticle III, when a United States District Court nullified a\nportion of its State Constitution. See ante, at 11 (citing\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 137 (1986)). To determine\nwhether justiciability continues in appellate proceedings\nafter the State Executive acquiesced in the District Court’s\nadverse judgment, it is necessary to ascertain what per-\nsons, if any, have “authority under state law to represent\nthe State’s interests” in federal court. Karcher v. May, 484\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 72, 82 (1987); see also Arizonans for Official English\nv. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43, 65 (1997).\n   As the Court notes, the California Elections Code does\nnot on its face prescribe in express terms the duties or\nrights of proponents once the initiative becomes law. Ante,\nat 8. If that were the end of the matter, the Court’s analy-\nsis would have somewhat more force. But it is not the end\nof the matter. It is for California, not this Court, to de-\ntermine whether and to what extent the Elections Code\nprovisions are instructive and relevant in determining the\nauthority of proponents to assert the State’s interest in\npostenactment judicial proceedings. And it is likewise not\nfor this Court to say that a State must determine the\nsubstance and meaning of its laws by statute, or by judi-\ncial decision, or by a combination of the two. See Sweezy\nv. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 255 (1957) (plurality\nopinion); Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71, 84 (1902). That,\ntoo, is for the State to decide.\n   This Court, in determining the substance of state law, is\n“bound by a state court’s construction of a state statute.”\nWisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 483 (1993). And the\nSupreme Court of California, in response to the certified\nquestion submitted to it in this case, has determined that\nState Elections Code provisions directed to initiative\nproponents do inform and instruct state law respecting the\nrights and status of proponents in postelection judicial\nproceedings. Here, in reliance on these statutes and the\nCalifornia Constitution, the State Supreme Court has held\nthat proponents do have authority “under California law\nto appear and assert the state’s interest in the initiative’s\nvalidity and appeal a judgment invalidating the measure\nwhen the public officials who ordinarily defend the meas-\nure or appeal such a judgment decline to do so.” Perry\nv. Brown, 52 Cal. 4th 1116, 1127, 265 P. 3d 1002, 1007\n(2011).\n   The reasons the Supreme Court of California gave for its\n4                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nholding have special relevance in the context of determin-\ning whether proponents have the authority to seek a\nfederal-court remedy for the State’s concrete, substantial,\nand continuing injury. As a class, official proponents are\na small, identifiable group. See Cal. Elec. Code Ann.\n§9001(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2013). Because many of their\ndecisions must be unanimous, see §§9001(b)(1), 9002(b),\nthey are necessarily few in number. Their identities\nare public. §9001(b)(2). Their commitment is substantial.\nSee §§9607–9609 (West Cum. Supp. 2013) (obtaining pe-\ntition signatures); §9001(c) (monetary fee); §§9065(d),\n9067, 9069 (West 2003) (drafting arguments for official\nballot pamphlet). They know and understand the purpose\nand operation of the proposed law, an important requisite\nin defending initiatives on complex matters such as taxa-\ntion and insurance. Having gone to great lengths to con-\nvince voters to enact an initiative, they have a stake in the\noutcome and the necessary commitment to provide zealous\nadvocacy.\n   Thus, in California, proponents play a “unique role . . .\nin the initiative process.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1024. They “have a unique relationship to the voter-\napproved measure that makes them especially likely to be\nreliable and vigorous advocates for the measure and to\nbe so viewed by those whose votes secured the initiative’s\nenactment into law.” Ibid.; see also id., at 1160, 265 P. 3d,\nat 1030 (because of “their special relationship to the ini-\ntiative measure,” proponents are “the most obvious and\nlogical private individuals to ably and vigorously defend\nthe validity of the challenged measure on behalf of the\ninterests of the voters who adopted the initiative into\nlaw”). Proponents’ authority under state law is not a\ncontrivance. It is not a fictional construct. It is the prod-\nuct of the California Constitution and the California Elec-\ntions Code. There is no basis for this Court to set aside\nthe California Supreme Court’s determination of state\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

Id., at 1161–1165, 265 P. 3d, at 1031–1033. In\nSportsmen for I–143 v. Fifteenth Jud. Ct., 2002 MT 18,\n308 Mont. 189, 40 P. 3d 400, the Montana Supreme Court\nunanimously held that because initiative sponsors “may be\nin the best position to defend their interpretation” of the\ninitiative and had a “direct, substantial, legally protecta-\nble interest in” the lawsuit challenging that interpreta-\ntion, they were “entitled to intervene as a matter of right.”\nId., at 194–195, 40 P. 3d, at 403. The Alaska Supreme\nCourt reached a similar unanimous result in Alaskans\nfor a Common Language Inc., v. Kritz, 3 P. 3d 906 (2000).\nIt noted that, except in extraordinary cases, “a sponsor’s\ndirect interest in legislation enacted through the initiative\nprocess and the concomitant need to avoid the appearance\nof [a conflict of interest] will ordinarily preclude courts\nfrom denying intervention as of right to a sponsoring group.”\nId., at 914.\n   For these and other reasons, the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia held that the California Elections Code and\nArticle II, §8, of the California Constitution afford propo-\nnents “the authority . . . to assert the state’s interest in the\nvalidity of the initiative” when State officials decline to do\nso. 52 Cal. 4th, at 1152, 265 P. 3d, at 1024. The court\nrepeated this unanimous holding more than a half-dozen\ntimes and in no uncertain terms. See id., at 1126, 1127,\n1139, 1149, 1151, 1152, 1165, 256 P. 3d, at 1006, 1007,\n1015, 1022, 1024, 1025, 1033; see also id., at 1169–1170,\n265 P. 3d, at 1036–1037 (Kennard, J., concurring). That\nshould suffice to resolve the central issue on which the\nfederal question turns.\n6                 HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n                               II\n\n                               A\n\n   The Court concludes that proponents lack sufficient\nties to the state government. It notes that they “are not\nelected,” “answer to no one,” and lack “‘a fiduciary obligation’”\nto the State. Ante, at 15 (quoting 1 Restatement (Third) of\nAgency §1.01, Comments e, f (2005)). But what the Court\ndeems deficiencies in the proponents’ connection to the\nState government, the State Supreme Court saw as essen-\ntial qualifications to defend the initiative system. The\nvery object of the initiative system is to establish a law-\nmaking process that does not depend upon state officials.\nIn California, the popular initiative is necessary to imple-\nment “the theory that all power of government ultimately\nresides in the people.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1140, 265 P. 3d, at\n1016 (internal quotation marks omitted). The right to\nadopt initiatives has been described by the California\ncourts as “one of the most precious rights of [the State’s]\ndemocratic process.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That historic role for the initiative system “grew\nout of dissatisfaction with the then governing public offi-\ncials and a widespread belief that the people had lost\ncontrol of the political process.” Ibid. The initiative’s\n“primary purpose,” then, “was to afford the people the\nability to propose and to adopt constitutional amendments\nor statutory provisions that their elected public officials\nhad refused or declined to adopt.” Ibid.\n   The California Supreme Court has determined that this\npurpose is undermined if the very officials the initiative\nprocess seeks to circumvent are the only parties who can\ndefend an enacted initiative when it is challenged in a\nlegal proceeding. See id., at 1160, 265 P. 3d, at 1030; cf.\nAlaskans for a Common Language, supra, at 914 (noting\nthat proponents must be allowed to defend an enacted\ninitiative in order to avoid the perception, correct or\nnot, “that the interests of [the proponents] were not being\n                   Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)              7\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ndefended vigorously by the executive branch”). Giving the\nGovernor and attorney general this de facto veto will erode\none of the cornerstones of the State’s governmental struc-\nture. See 52 Cal. 4th, at 1126–1128, 265 P. 3d, at 1006–\n1007. And in light of the frequency with which initiatives’\nopponents resort to litigation, the impact of that veto\ncould be substantial. K. Miller, Direct Democracy and the\nCourts 106 (2009) (185 of the 455 initiatives approved in\nArizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington\nbetween 1900 and 2008 were challenged in court). As a\nconsequence, California finds it necessary to vest the re-\nsponsibility and right to defend a voter-approved initiative\nin the initiative’s proponents when the State Executive\ndeclines to do so.\n   Yet today the Court demands that the State follow the\nRestatement of Agency. See ante, at 15–16. There are\nreasons, however, why California might conclude that a\nconventional agency relationship is inconsistent with the\nhistory, design, and purpose of the initiative process. The\nState may not wish to associate itself with proponents or\ntheir views outside of the “extremely narrow and limited”\ncontext of this litigation, 52 Cal. 4th, at 1159, 265 P. 3d, at\n1029, or to bear the cost of proponents’ legal fees. The\nState may also wish to avoid the odd conflict of having a\nformal agent of the State (the initiative’s proponent) argu-\ning in favor of a law’s validity while state officials (e.g., the\nattorney general) contend in the same proceeding that it\nshould be found invalid.\n   Furthermore, it is not clear who the principal in an\nagency relationship would be. It would make little sense if\nit were the Governor or attorney general, for that would\nfrustrate the initiative system’s purpose of circumventing\nelected officials who fail or refuse to effect the public will.\nId., at 1139–1140, 265 P. 3d, at 1016. If there is to be a\nprincipal, then, it must be the people of California, as the\nultimate sovereign in the State. See ibid., 265 P. 3d, at\n8                HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n1015–1016 (quoting Cal. Const., Art. II, §1) (“ ‘All political\npower is inherent in the people’ ”). But the Restatement\nmay offer no workable example of an agent representing\na principal composed of nearly 40 million residents of a\nState. Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency, p. 2, Scope\nNote (1957) (noting that the Restatement “does not state\nthe special rules applicable to public officers”); 1 Restate-\nment (First) of Agency, p. 4, Scope Note (1933) (same).\n   And if the Court’s concern is that the proponents are\nunaccountable, that fear is neither well founded nor suf-\nficient to overcome the contrary judgment of the State\nSupreme Court. It must be remembered that both elected\nofficials and initiative proponents receive their authority\nto speak for the State of California directly from the peo-\nple. The Court apparently believes that elected officials\nare acceptable “agents” of the State, see ante, at 11–12,\nbut they are no more subject to ongoing supervision of\ntheir principal—i.e., the people of the State—than are\ninitiative proponents. At most, a Governor or attorney\ngeneral can be recalled or voted out of office in a subse-\nquent election, but proponents, too, can have their authority\nterminated or their initiative overridden by a subsequent\nballot measure. Finally, proponents and their attor-\nneys, like all other litigants and counsel who appear before\na federal court, are subject to duties of candor, deco-\nrum, and respect for the tribunal and co-parties alike, all\nof which guard against the possibility that initiative pro-\nponents will somehow fall short of the appropriate stan-\ndards for federal litigation.\n                            B\n  Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, this Court’s prece-\ndents do not indicate that a formal agency relationship is\nnecessary. In Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72 (1987), the\nSpeaker of the New Jersey Assembly (Karcher) and Presi-\ndent of the New Jersey Senate (Orechio) intervened in\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsupport of a school moment-of-silence law that the State’s\nGovernor and attorney general declined to defend in court.\nIn considering the question of standing, the Court looked\nto New Jersey law to determine whether Karcher and\nOrechio “had authority under state law to represent the\nState’s interest in both the District Court and Court of\nAppeals.” Id., at 82. The Court concluded that they did.\nBecause the “New Jersey Supreme Court ha[d] granted\napplications of the Speaker of the General Assembly and\nthe President of the Senate to intervene as parties-\nrespondent on behalf of the legislature in defense of a\nlegislative enactment,” the Karcher Court held that stand-\ning had been proper in the District Court and Court of\nAppeals. Ibid. By the time the case arrived in this Court,\nKarcher and Orechio had lost their presiding legislative\noffices, without which they lacked the authority to repre-\nsent the State under New Jersey law. This, the Court\nheld, deprived them of standing. Id., at 81. Here, by\ncontrast, proponents’ authority under California law is not\ncontingent on officeholder status, so their standing is\nunaffected by the fact that they “hold no office” in Califor-\nnia’s Government. Ante, at 12.\n  Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U. S. 43\n(1997), is consistent with the premises of this dissent, not\nwith the rationale of the Court’s opinion. See ante, at 13–\n14. There, the Court noted its serious doubts as to the\naspiring defenders’ standing because there was “no Ari-\nzona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the\npeople of Arizona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the\nconstitutionality of initiatives made law of the State.”\n520 U. S., at 65. The Court did use the word “agents”; but,\nread in context, it is evident that the Court’s intention was\nnot to demand a formal agency relationship in compliance\nwith the Restatement. Rather, the Court used the term\nas shorthand for a party whom “state law authorizes” to\n“represent the State’s interests” in court. Ibid.\n10               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   Both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia were mindful of these precedents and sought to\ncomply with them. The state court, noting the importance\nof Arizonans for Official English, expressed its under-\nstanding that “the high court’s doubts as to the official\ninitiative proponents’ standing in that case were based, at\nleast in substantial part, on the fact that the court was not\naware of any ‘Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors\nas agents of the people of Arizona to defend . . . the consti-\ntutionality of initiatives made law of the State.’ ” 52 Cal.\n4th, at 1136–1137, 265 P. 3d, at 1013–1014 (quoting 520\nU. S., at 65). Based on this passage, it concluded that\n“nothing in [Arizonans for Official English] indicates that\nif a state’s law does authorize the official proponents of an\ninitiative to assert the state’s interest in the validity of a\nchallenged state initiative when the public officials who\nordinarily assert that interest have declined to do so, the\nproponents would not have standing to assert the state’s\ninterest in the initiative’s validity in a federal lawsuit.”\nId., at 1137, 265 P. 3d, at 1014.\n   The Court of Appeals, too, was mindful of this require-\nment. Perry v. Brown, 671 F. 3d 1052, 1072–1073 (CA9\n2012). Although that panel divided on the proper resolu-\ntion of the merits of this case, it was unanimous in con-\ncluding that proponents satisfy the requirements of Article\nIII. Compare id., at 1070–1075 (majority opinion), with\nid., at 1096–1097 (N. R. Smith, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). Its central premise, ignored by the\nCourt today, was that the “State’s highest court [had] held\nthat California law provides precisely what the Arizonans\nCourt found lacking in Arizona law: it confers on the\nofficial proponents of an initiative the authority to assert\nthe State’s interests in defending the constitutionality of\nthat initiative, where state officials who would ordinarily\nassume that responsibility choose not to do so.” Id., at\n1072 (majority opinion). The Court of Appeals and the\n                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nState Supreme Court did not ignore Arizonans for Official\nEnglish; they were faithful to it.\n                               C\n   The Court’s approach in this case is also in tension with\nother cases in which the Court has permitted individuals\nto assert claims on behalf of the government or others.\nFor instance, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a)(2)\nallows a court to appoint a private attorney to investigate\nand prosecute potential instances of criminal contempt.\nUnder the Rule, this special prosecutor is not the agent of\nthe appointing judge; indeed, the prosecutor’s “determina-\ntion of which persons should be targets of the investiga-\ntion, what methods of investigation should be used, what\ninformation will be sought as evidence,” whom to charge,\nand other “decisions . . . critical to the conduct of a prose-\ncution, are all made outside the supervision of the court.”\nYoung v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481\nU. S. 787, 807 (1987). Also, just as proponents have been\nauthorized to represent the State of California, “ ‘[p]rivate\nattorneys appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt\naction represent the United States,’ ” United States v. Prov-\nidence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693, 700 (1988). They are\n“appointed solely to pursue the public interest in vindica-\ntion of the court’s authority,” Young, supra, at 804, an\ninterest that—like California’s interest in the validity of\nits laws—is “unique to the sovereign,” Providence Journal\nCo., supra, at 700. And, although the Court dismisses the\nproponents’ standing claim because initiative proponents\n“are not elected” and “decide for themselves, with no re-\nview, what arguments to make and how to make them” in\ndefense of the enacted initiative, ante, at 15, those same\ncharges could be leveled with equal if not greater force at\nthe special prosecutors just discussed. See Young, supra,\nat 807.\n   Similar questions might also arise regarding qui tam\n12               HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nactions, see, e.g., Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v.\nUnited States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765, 771–778\n(2000); suits involving “next friends” litigating on behalf of\na real party in interest, see, e.g., Whitmore v. Arkansas,\n495 U. S. 149, 161–166 (1990); or shareholder-derivative\nsuits, see, e.g., Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U. S. 115, 125–126\n(1991). There is no more of an agency relationship in any\nof these settings than in the instant case, yet the Court\nhas nonetheless permitted a party to assert the interests\nof another. That qui tam actions and “next friend” litiga-\ntion may have a longer historical pedigree than the initia-\ntive process, see ante, at 12–13, is no basis for finding\nArticle III’s standing requirement met in those cases\nbut lacking here. In short, the Court today unsettles its\nlongtime understanding of the basis for jurisdiction in\nrepresentative-party litigation, leaving the law unclear and\nthe District Court’s judgment, and its accompanying state-\nwide injunction, effectively immune from appellate review.\n                              III\n   There is much irony in the Court’s approach to justicia-\nbility in this case. A prime purpose of justiciability is to\nensure vigorous advocacy, yet the Court insists upon\nlitigation conducted by state officials whose preference is\nto lose the case. The doctrine is meant to ensure that\ncourts are responsible and constrained in their power, but\nthe Court’s opinion today means that a single district\ncourt can make a decision with far-reaching effects that\ncannot be reviewed. And rather than honor the principle\nthat justiciability exists to allow disputes of public policy\nto be resolved by the political process rather than the\ncourts, see, e.g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750–752\n(1984), here the Court refuses to allow a State’s authorized\nrepresentatives to defend the outcome of a democratic\nelection.\n   The Court’s opinion disrespects and disparages both the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)          13\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\npolitical process in California and the well-stated opinion\nof the California Supreme Court in this case. The Califor-\nnia Supreme Court, not this Court, expresses concern for\nvigorous representation; the California Supreme Court,\nnot this Court, recognizes the necessity to avoid conflicts\nof interest; the California Supreme Court, not this Court,\ncomprehends the real interest at stake in this litigation\nand identifies the most proper party to defend that inter-\nest. The California Supreme Court’s opinion reflects a\nbetter understanding of the dynamics and principles of\nArticle III than does this Court’s opinion.\n   Of course, the Court must be cautious before entering a\nrealm of controversy where the legal community and\nsociety at large are still formulating ideas and approaches\nto a most difficult subject. But it is shortsighted to mis-\nconstrue principles of justiciability to avoid that subject.\nAs the California Supreme Court recognized, “the question\nbefore us involves a fundamental procedural issue that\nmay arise with respect to any initiative measure, without\nregard to its subject matter.” 52 Cal. 4th, at 1124, 265\nP. 3d, at 1005 (emphasis in original). If a federal court\nmust rule on a constitutional point that either confirms or\nrejects the will of the people expressed in an initiative,\nthat is when it is most necessary, not least necessary, to\ninsist on rules that ensure the most committed and vigor-\nous adversary arguments to inform the rulings of the\ncourts.\n                        *     *    *\n  In the end, what the Court fails to grasp or accept is the\nbasic premise of the initiative process. And it is this. The\nessence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in\nthe people and flows to the government, not the other way\naround. Freedom resides first in the people without need\nof a grant from government. The California initiative\nprocess embodies these principles and has done so for over\n14              HOLLINGSWORTH v. PERRY\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\na century. “Through the structure of its government, and\nthe character of those who exercise government authority,\na State defines itself as sovereign.” Gregory v. Ashcroft,\n501 U. S. 452, 460 (1991). In California and the 26 other\nStates that permit initiatives and popular referendums,\nthe people have exercised their own inherent sovereign\nright to govern themselves. The Court today frustrates\nthat choice by nullifying, for failure to comply with the\nRestatement of Agency, a State Supreme Court decision\nholding that state law authorizes an enacted initiative’s\nproponents to defend the law if and when the State’s usual\nlegal advocates decline to do so. The Court’s opinion fails\nto abide by precedent and misapplies basic principles\nof justiciability. Those errors necessitate this respectful\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/932061/", "sha1": "597c91d8853f55af4daeaca3c97877031bc5cec5", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2012-077", "time_retrieved": "2013-06-26T08:57:01.466742"}
