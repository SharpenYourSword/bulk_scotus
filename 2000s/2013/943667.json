S. ____ (2013)          1\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n LINDA LANUS, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE\n  ESTATE OF ERIC K. LANUS v. UNITED STATES\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED\n  STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n              No. 12\u2013862.   Decided June 27, 2013\n\n   The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS, dissenting from denial of certiorari.\n   Petitioner Linda Lanus asks the Court to revisit our\ndecision in Feres v. United States, 340 U. S. 135 (1950),\nwhich interpreted the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) to\ndeny military personnel the ability to recover for injuries\nresulting from the negligence of federal employees. I would\ngrant the petition to reconsider Feres\u2019 exclusion of claims\nby military personnel from the scope of the FTCA.\n   The FTCA is a sweeping waiver of sovereign immunity\nthat, under specified circumstances, renders the Govern-\nment liable for money damages for a variety of injuries\ncaused by the negligence of Government employees. 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71346(b)(1). As written, the FTCA \u201crenders the\nUnited States liable to all persons, including service-\nmen, injured by the negligence of Government employ-\nees.\u201d United States v. Johnson, 481 U. S. 681, 693 (1987)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). While the Act contains a number\nof exceptions to this broad waiver of immunity, \u201cnone\ngenerally precludes FTCA suits brought by servicemen.\u201d\nIbid. Congress contemplated such an exception, Feres,\nsupra, at 139, but codified language that is far more lim-\nited. See \u00a72680(j) (excluding from waiver \u201c[a]ny claim\narising out of the combatant activities of the military or\nnaval forces, or the Coast Guard, during time of war\u201d\n(emphasis added)).\n   Nevertheless, in Feres, the Court held that \u201cthe Gov-\nernment is not liable under the [FTCA] for injuries to\n2                 LANUS v. UNITED STATES\n\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\n\nservicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the\ncourse of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U. S., at 146.\nThere is no support for this conclusion in the text of the\nstatute, and it has the unfortunate consequence of depriv-\ning servicemen of any remedy when they are injured by\nthe negligence of the Government or its employees. I tend\nto agree with Justice Scalia that \u201cFeres was wrongly de-\ncided and heartily deserves the widespread, almost uni-\nversal criticism it has received.\u201d Johnson, supra, at 700\n(internal quotation marks omitted). At a bare minimum,\nit should be reconsidered.\n   The instant petition asks the Court to do just that. I\nwould grant this request. Private reliance interests on a\ndecision that precludes tort recoveries by military person-\nnel are nonexistent, and I see no other reason why the\nCourt should hesitate to bring its interpretation of the FTCA\nin line with the plain meaning of the statute. I, there-\nfore, respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to deny\nthis petition.\n",
