LYNN COOPER,\n                  WARDEN\n   ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED \n\n    STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n              No. 12\u20137516. Decided June 27, 2013\n\n\n  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n  Statement of JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR joins, respecting the denial of the petition for\nwrit of certiorari.\n  Petitioner Elrick Gallow, like the petitioner in the re-\ncently decided case of Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U. S. ___\n(2013), alleges that he received ineffective assistance of\ncounsel both at his criminal trial and during his first state\npostconviction proceeding. Specifically, petitioner\u2019s trial\ncounsel has admitted in an affidavit and testimony be-\nfore the State\u2019s Disciplinary Board that \u201che was unable to\neffectively cross-examine the victim because he was suffer-\ning from panic attacks and, more importantly, is related to\nthe victim. Because of this, [he] advised Gallow to plead\nguilty despite Gallow\u2019s reluctance to do so, and failed to in-\nform both Gallow and the State that he had evidence to\nimpeach the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d 1 App. to Pet. for Cert. 3.\nIn reliance on this conflicted advice, Gallow pleaded guilty\nmidway through trial. His trial counsel was subsequently\ndisbarred. When Gallow, represented by a different attor-\nney, filed for state postconviction relief, his new attorney\nfailed to bring forward \u201cany admissible evidence\u201d to sup-\nport his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Id.,\nat 15. Namely, in state court Gallow\u2019s habeas counsel\nrepeatedly neglected to subpoena the trial counsel, which\nled the state court to reject the counsel\u2019s affidavit on state\nevidentiary grounds. This meant that Gallow was left\nwith a claim that had virtually no evidentiary support.\n2                    GALLOW v. COOPER\n\n                    Statement of BREYER, J.\n\n  In my view, a petitioner like Gallow is in a situation\nindistinguishable from that of a petitioner like Trevino:\nEach of these two petitioners failed to obtain a hearing\non the merits of his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaim because state habeas counsel neglected to \u201cproperly\npresen[t]\u201d the petitioner\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim in\nstate court. Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U. S. 1, ___ (2012) (slip\nop., at 2). A claim without any evidence to support it\nmight as well be no claim at all. In such circumstances,\nwhere state habeas counsel deficiently neglects to bring\nforward \u201cany admissible evidence\u201d to support a substantial\nclaim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, there seems\nto me to be a strong argument that the state habeas coun-\nsel\u2019s ineffective assistance results in a procedural default\nof that claim. The ineffective assistance of state habeas\ncounsel might provide cause to excuse the default of the\nclaim, thereby allowing the federal habeas court to con-\nsider the full contours of Gallow\u2019s ineffective-assistance\nclaim. For that reason, the Fifth Circuit should not neces-\nsarily have found that it could not consider the affidavit\nand testimony supporting Gallow\u2019s claim because of Cul-\nlen v. Pinholster, 563 U. S. ___ (2011).\n  Nonetheless, I recognize that no United States Court of\nAppeals has clearly adopted a position that might give\nGallow relief. But I stress that the denial of certiorari\nhere is not a reflection of the merits of Gallow\u2019s claims.\n",
