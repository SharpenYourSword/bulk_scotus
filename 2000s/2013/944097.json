UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n       No. 12\u2013357.      Argued April 23, 2013\u2014Decided June 26, 2013\nInvestments for the employee pension fund of the State of New York\n  and its local governments are chosen by the fund\u2019s sole trustee, the\n  State Comptroller. After the Comptroller\u2019s general counsel recom-\n  mended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ven-\n  tures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding\n  that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to\n  disclose information about the general counsel\u2019s alleged affair to his\n  wife, government officials, and the media. Some of the e-mails were\n  traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing part-\n  ner of FA Technology Ventures. Petitioner was convicted of attempt-\n  ed extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71951(a),\n  which defines \u201cextortion\u201d to mean \u201cthe obtaining of property from an-\n  other, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-\n  ened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,\u201d\n  \u00a71951(b)(2). The jury specified that the property petitioner attempt-\n  ed to extort was the general counsel\u2019s recommendation to approve the\n  investment. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer\n approve an investment does not constitute \u201cthe obtaining of property\n from another\u201d under the Hobbs Act. Pp. 3\u20139.\n    (a) Absent other indication, \u201cCongress intends to incorporate the\n well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d Neder v.\n United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23. As far as is known, no case predating\n the Hobbs Act\u2014English, federal, or state\u2014ever identified conduct\n such as that charged here as extortionate. Extortion required the ob-\n taining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim. The Act\u2019s\n text confirms that obtaining property requires \u201cnot only the depriva-\n2                     SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    tion but also the acquisition of property.\u201d Scheidler v. National Or-\n    ganization for Women, Inc., 537 U. S. 393, 404. The property extort-\n    ed must therefore be transferable\u2014that is, capable of passing from\n    one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged prop-\n    erty here. The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\n    Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a\n    1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that\n    statute. And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts\n    had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that oc-\n    curred here was coercion. Finally, this Court\u2019s own precedent de-\n    mands reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions. See id., at 404\u2013405.\n    Pp. 3\u20138.\n       (b) The Government\u2019s defense of the theory of conviction is unper-\n    suasive. No fluent speaker of English would say that \u201cpetitioner ob-\n    tained and exercised the general counsel\u2019s right to make a recom-\n    mendation,\u201d any more than he would say that a person \u201cobtained and\n    exercised another\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d He would say that \u201cpetition-\n    er forced the general counsel to make a particular recommendation,\u201d\n    just as he would say that a person \u201cforced another to make a state-\n    ment.\u201d Adopting the Government\u2019s theory here would not only make\n    nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction be-\n    tween extortion and coercion and ignore Congress\u2019s choice to penalize\n    one but not the other.

S. C. \u00a71951(b)(2).\n                              I\n  New York\u2019s Common Retirement Fund is an employee\npension fund for the State of New York and its local gov-\nernments. As sole trustee of the Fund, the State Comp-\ntroller chooses Fund investments. When the Comptroller\ndecides to approve an investment he issues a \u201cCommit-\nment.\u201d A Commitment, however, does not actually bind\nthe Fund. For that to happen, the Fund and the recipient\nof the investment must enter into a limited partnership\nagreement. 683 F. 3d 436, 438 (CA2 2012).\n  Petitioner Giridhar Sekhar was a managing partner of\nFA Technology Ventures. In October 2009, the Comptrol-\nler\u2019s office was considering whether to invest in a fund\nmanaged by that firm. The office\u2019s general counsel made a\nwritten recommendation to the Comptroller not to invest\nin the fund, after learning that the Office of the New York\n2                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General was investigating another fund man-\naged by the firm. The Comptroller decided not to issue a\nCommitment and notified a partner of FA Technology\nVentures. That partner had previously heard rumors that\nthe general counsel was having an extramarital affair.\n   The general counsel then received a series of anony-\nmous e-mails demanding that he recommend moving for-\nward with the investment and threatening, if he did not,\nto disclose information about his alleged affair to his wife,\ngovernment officials, and the media. App. 59\u201361. The\ngeneral counsel contacted law enforcement, which traced\nsome of the e-mails to petitioner\u2019s home computer and\nother e-mails to offices of FA Technology Ventures.\n   Petitioner was indicted for, and a jury convicted him of,\nattempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71951(a). That Act subjects a person to criminal\nliability if he \u201cin any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\naffects commerce or the movement of any article or com-\nmodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts\nor conspires so to do.\u201d \u00a71951(a). The Act defines \u201cextor-\ntion\u201d to mean \u201cthe obtaining of property from another,\nwith his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or\nthreatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d \u00a71951(b)(2).1 On the verdict form, the jury was\nasked to specify the property that petitioner attempted to\nextort: (1) \u201cthe Commitment\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Comptroller\u2019s ap-\nproval of the Commitment\u201d; or (3) \u201cthe General Counsel\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Petitioner was also convicted of several counts of interstate trans-\n\nmission of extortionate threats, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7875(d).\nUnder \u00a7875(d), a person is criminally liable if he, \u201cwith intent to extort\nfrom any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other\nthing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any com-\nmunication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation\nof the addressee.\u201d In this case, both parties concede that the definition\nof \u201cextortion\u201d under the Hobbs Act also applies to the \u00a7875(d) counts.\nWe express no opinion on the validity of that concession.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nrecommendation to approve the Commitment.\u201d App. 141\u2013\n142. The jury chose only the third option.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed\nthe conviction. The court held that the general counsel\n\u201chad a property right in rendering sound legal advice to\nthe Comptroller and, specifically, to recommend\u2014free from\nthreats\u2014whether the Comptroller should issue a Com-\nmitment for [the funds].\u201d 683 F. 3d, at 441. The court\nconcluded that petitioner not only attempted to deprive\nthe general counsel of his \u201cproperty right,\u201d but that peti-\ntioner also \u201cattempted to exercise that right by forcing the\nGeneral Counsel to make a recommendation determined\nby [petitioner].\u201d Id., at 442.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II\n                             A\n  Whether viewed from the standpoint of the common\nlaw, the text and genesis of the statute at issue here, or\nthe jurisprudence of this Court\u2019s prior cases, what was\ncharged in this case was not extortion.\n  It is a settled principle of interpretation that, absent\nother indication, \u201cCongress intends to incorporate the\nwell-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d\nNeder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999).\n    \u201c[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are\n    accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of cen-\n    turies of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the\n    cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed\n    word in the body of learning from which it was taken\n    and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\n    mind unless otherwise instructed.\u201d Morissette v.\n    United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).\nOr as Justice Frankfurter colorfully put it, \u201cif a word is\nobviously transplanted from another legal source, whether\n4                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil\nwith it.\u201d Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47\nColum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947).\n   The Hobbs Act punishes \u201cextortion,\u201d one of the oldest\ncrimes in our legal tradition, see E. Coke, The Third Part\nof the Institutes of the Laws of England 148\u2013150 (1648)\n(reprint 2008). The crime originally applied only to extor-\ntionate action by public officials, but was later extended\nby statute to private extortion. See 4 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s\nCriminal Law \u00a7\u00a7695, 699 (14th ed. 1981). As far as is\nknown, no case predating the Hobbs Act\u2014English, federal,\nor state\u2014ever identified conduct such as that charged\nhere as extortionate. Extortion required the obtaining of\nitems of value, typically cash, from the victim. See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Whaley, 6 Cow. 661 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1827) (justice\nof the peace properly indicted for extorting money); Com-\nmonwealth v. Bagley, 24 Mass. 279 (1828) (officer properly\nconvicted for demanding a fee for letting a man out of\nprison); Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 66 Ky. 25 (1867)\n(jailer properly indicted for extorting money from pris-\noner); Queen v. Woodward, 11 Mod. 137, 88 Eng. Rep. 949\n(K. B. 1707) (upholding indictment for extorting \u201cmoney\nand a note\u201d). It did not cover mere coercion to act, or to\nrefrain from acting. See, e.g., King v. Burdett, 1 Ld. Raym.\n149, 91 Eng. Rep. 996 (K. B. 1696) (dictum) (extortion\nconsisted of the \u201ctaking of money for the use of the stalls,\u201d\nnot the deprivation of \u201cfree liberty to sell [one\u2019s] wares in\nthe market according to law\u201d).\n   The text of the statute at issue confirms that the\nalleged property here cannot be extorted. Enacted in 1946,\nthe Hobbs Act defines its crime of \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cthe ob-\ntaining of property from another, with his consent, induced\nby wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence,\nor fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71951(b)(2) (emphasis added). Obtaining property re-\nquires \u201cnot only the deprivation but also the acquisition of\n                      Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     5\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nproperty.\u201d Scheidler v. National Organization for Women,\nInc., 537 U. S. 393, 404 (2003) (citing United States v.\nEnmons, 410 U. S. 396, 400 (1973)). That is, it requires\nthat the victim \u201cpart with\u201d his property, R. Perkins & R.\nBoyce, Criminal Law 451 (3d ed. 1982), and that the extor-\ntionist \u201cgain possession\u201d of it, Scheidler, supra, at 403,\nn. 8; see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1682\n(2d ed. 1949) (defining \u201cobtain\u201d); Murray, Note, Protesters,\nExtortion, and Coercion: Preventing RICO from Chilling\nFirst Amendment Freedoms, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 691,\n706 (1999) (Murray). The property extorted must there-\nfore be transferable\u2014that is, capable of passing from one\nperson to another. The alleged property here lacks that\ndefining feature.2\n   The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\nThe Act was modeled after \u00a7850 of the New York Penal\nLaw (1909), which was derived from the famous Field\nCode, a 19th-century model penal code, see 4 Commission-\ners of the Code, Penal Code of the State of New York \u00a7613,\np. 220 (1865) (reprint 1998). Congress borrowed, nearly\nverbatim, the New York statute\u2019s definition of extortion.\nSee Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 403. The New York statute\ncontained, in addition to the felony crime of extortion, a\nnew (that is to say, nonexistent at common law) misde-\nmeanor crime of coercion. Whereas the former required,\nas we have said, \u201c \u2018the criminal acquisition of . . . property,\u2019 \u201d\nibid., the latter required merely the use of threats \u201cto\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 It may well be proper under the Hobbs Act for the Government to\n\ncharge a person who obtains money by threatening a third party, who\nobtains funds belonging to a corporate or governmental entity by\nthreatening the entity\u2019s agent, see 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7408, p.\n334, and n. 3 (9th ed. 1923) (citing State v. Moore, 1 Ind. 548 (1849)), or\nwho obtains \u201cgoodwill and customer revenues\u201d by threatening a market\ncompetitor, see, e.g., United States v. Zemek, 634 F. 2d 1159, 1173 (CA9\n1980). Each of these might be considered \u201cobtaining property from\nanother.\u201d We need not consider those situations, however, because the\nGovernment did not charge any of them here.\n6                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompel another person to do or to abstain from doing an\nact which such other such person has a legal right to do\nor to abstain from doing.\u201d N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7530 (1909),\nearlier codified in N. Y. Penal Code \u00a7653 (1881). Congress\ndid not copy the coercion provision. The omission must\nhave been deliberate, since it was perfectly clear that\nextortion did not include coercion. At the time of the\nborrowing (1946), New York courts had consistently held\nthat the sort of interference with rights that occurred here\nwas coercion. See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N. Y. 556,\n188 N. E. 62 (1933) (per curiam) (compelling store owner\nto become a member of a trade association and to remove\nadvertisements); People v. Scotti, 266 N. Y. 480, 195 N. E.\n162 (App. Div. 1934) (compelling victim to enter into\nagreement with union); People v. Kaplan, 240 App. Div.\n72, 74\u201375, 269 N. Y. S. 161, 163\u2013164, aff \u2019d, 264 N. Y. 675,\n191 N. E. 621 (1934) (compelling union members to drop\nlawsuits against union leadership).3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Also revealing, the New York code prohibited conspiracy \u201c[t]o pre-\n\nvent another from exercising a lawful trade or calling, or doing any\nother lawful act, by force, threats, intimidation.\u201d N. Y. Penal Law\n\u00a7580(5) (1909) (emphasis added). That separate codification, which Con-\ngress did not adopt, is further evidence that the New York crime of\nextortion (and hence the federal crime) did not reach interference with\na person\u2019s right to ply a lawful trade, similar to the right claimed here.\n   Seeking to extract something from the void, the Government relies\non cases that interpret a provision of the New York code defining\nthe kinds of threats that qualify as threats to do \u201cunlawful injury to the\nperson or property,\u201d which is what the extortion statute requires. See\nN. Y. Penal Code \u00a7553 (1881); N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7851 (1909). Those\ncases held that they include threats to injure a business by preventing\nthe return of workers from a strike, People v. Barondess, 133 N. Y. 649,\n31 N. E. 240, 241\u2013242 (1892) (per curiam), and threats to terminate a\nperson\u2019s employment, People ex rel. Short v. Warden, 145 App. Div. 861,\n130 N. Y. S. 698, 700\u2013701 (1911), aff\u2019d, 206 N. Y. 632, 99 N. E. 1116\n(1912) (per curiam). Those cases are entirely inapposite here, where\nthe issue is not what constitutes a qualifying threat but what consti-\ntutes obtainable property.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   And finally, this Court\u2019s own precedent similarly de-\nmands reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions. In Scheidler,\nwe held that protesters did not commit extortion under the\nHobbs Act, even though they \u201cinterfered with, disrupted,\nand in some instances completely deprived\u201d abortion\nclinics of their ability to run their business. 537 U. S., at\n404\u2013405. We reasoned that the protesters may have\ndeprived the clinics of an \u201calleged property right,\u201d but they\ndid not pursue or receive \u201c \u2018something of value from\u2019 \u201d the\nclinics that they could then \u201cexercise, transfer, or sell\u201d\nthemselves. Id., at 405. The opinion supported its holding\nby citing the three New York coercion cases discussed\nabove. See id., at 405\u2013406.\n   This case is easier than Scheidler, where one might at\nleast have said that physical occupation of property\namounted to obtaining that property. The deprivation\nalleged here is far more abstract. Scheidler rested its\ndecision, as we do, on the term \u201cobtaining.\u201d Id., at 402,\nn. 6. The principle announced there\u2014that a defendant\nmust pursue something of value from the victim that can\nbe exercised, transferred, or sold\u2014applies with equal force\nhere.4 Whether one considers the personal right at issue\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  Government\u2019s attempt to distinguish Scheidler is unconvinc-\ning. In its view, had the protesters sought to force the clinics to pro-\nvide services other than abortion, extortion would have been a proper\ncharge. Petitioner committed extortion here, the Government says,\nbecause he did not merely attempt to prevent the general counsel from\ngiving a recommendation but tried instead to force him to issue one.\nThat distinction is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsensical. It is\ncoercion, not extortion, when a person is forced to do something and\nwhen he is forced to do nothing. See, e.g., N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7530 (1909)\n(it is a misdemeanor to coerce a \u201cperson to do or to abstain from doing\nan act\u201d). Congress\u2019s enactment of the Hobbs Act did not, through the\nphrase \u201cobtaining of property from another,\u201d suddenly transform every\nact that coerces affirmative conduct into a crime punishable for up to 20\nyears, while leaving those who \u201cmerely\u201d coerce inaction immune from\nfederal punishment.\n8                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto be \u201cproperty\u201d in a broad sense or not, it certainly was\nnot obtainable property under the Hobbs Act.5\n                               B\n   The Government\u2019s shifting and imprecise characteriza-\ntion of the alleged property at issue betrays the weakness\nof its case. According to the jury\u2019s verdict form, the \u201cprop-\nerty\u201d that petitioner attempted to extort was \u201cthe General\nCounsel\u2019s recommendation to approve the Commitment.\u201d\nApp. 142. But the Government expends minuscule effort\nin defending that theory of conviction. And for good\nreason\u2014to wit, our decision in Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12 (2000), which reversed a business owner\u2019s\nmail-fraud conviction for \u201cobtaining money or property\u201d\nthrough misrepresentations made in an application for a\nvideo-poker license issued by the State. We held that\na \u201clicense\u201d is not \u201cproperty\u201d while in the State\u2019s hands and\nso cannot be \u201cobtained\u201d from the State. Id., at 20\u201322.\nEven less so can an employee\u2019s yet-to-be-issued recom-\nmendation be called obtainable property, and less so still\na yet-to-be-issued recommendation that would merely ap-\nprove (but not effect) a particular investment.\n   Hence the Government\u2019s reliance on an alternative,\nmore sophisticated (and sophistic) description of the\nproperty. Instead of defending the jury\u2019s description, the Gov-\nernment hinges its case on the general counsel\u2019s \u201cintangi-\nble property right to give his disinterested legal opinion to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The concurrence contends that the \u201cright to make [a] recommenda-\n\ntion\u201d is not property. Post, at 4 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). We\nare not sure of that. If one defines property to include anything of\nvalue, surely some rights to make recommendations would qualify\u2014for\nexample, a member of the Pulitzer Prize Committee\u2019s right to recom-\nmend the recipient of the prize. We suppose that a prominent journal-\nist would not give up that right (he cannot, of course, transfer it) for a\nsignificant sum of money\u2014so it must be valuable. But the point\nrelevant to the present case is that it cannot be transferred, so it cannot\nbe the object of extortion under the statute.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

But what, exactly, would the petitioner\nhave obtained for himself? A right to give his own disin-\nterested legal opinion to his own client free of improper\ninterference? Or perhaps, a right to give the general coun-\nsel\u2019s disinterested legal opinion to the general counsel\u2019s\nclient?\n   Either formulation sounds absurd, because it is. Clearly,\npetitioner\u2019s goal was not to acquire the general coun-\nsel\u2019s \u201cintangible property right to give disinterested legal\nadvice.\u201d It was to force the general counsel to offer advice\nthat accorded with petitioner\u2019s wishes. But again, that is\ncoercion, not extortion. See Murray 721\u2013722. No fluent\nspeaker of English would say that \u201cpetitioner obtained\nand exercised the general counsel\u2019s right to make a rec-\nommendation,\u201d any more than he would say that a person\n\u201cobtained and exercised another\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d He\nwould say that \u201cpetitioner forced the general counsel to\nmake a particular recommendation,\u201d just as he would\nsay that a person \u201cforced another to make a statement.\u201d\nAdopting the Government\u2019s theory here would not only\nmake nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstand-\ning distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore\nCongress\u2019s choice to penalize one but not the other.

In my view,\nthey are not.\n                             I\n   The jury in this case returned a special verdict form\nand stated that the property that petitioner attempted\nto extort was \u201cthe General Counsel\u2019s recommendation to\napprove the Commitment.\u201d What the jury obviously\nmeant by this was the general counsel\u2019s internal sugges-\ntion to his superior that the state government issue a\nnonbinding commitment to invest in a fund managed by\nFA Technology Ventures. We must therefore decide\nwhether this nonbinding internal recommendation by a\nsalaried state employee constitutes \u201cproperty\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act, which defines \u201cextortion\u201d as\n\u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his con-\nsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened\nforce, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d\n\u00a71951(b)(2).\n2                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Hobbs Act does not define the term \u201cproperty,\u201d but\neven at common law the offense of extortion was under-\nstood to include the obtaining of any thing of value. 2 E.\nCoke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of\nEngland 368b (18th English ed. 1823) (\u201cExtortion . . . is a\ngreat misprison, by wresting or unlawfully taking by any\nofficer, by colour of his office, any money or valuable thing\nof or from any man\u201d); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*141 (extortion is \u201can abuse of public, justice which con-\nsists in any officer\u2019s unlawfully taking, by colour of his\noffice, from any man, any money or thing of value\u201d). See\nalso 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7401, pp. 331\u2013332 (9th ed.\n1923) (\u201cIn most cases, the thing obtained is money. . . . But\nprobably anything of value will suffice\u201d); 3 F. Wharton, A\nTreatise on Criminal Law \u00a71898, p. 2095 (11th ed. 1912)\n(\u201c[I]t is enough if any valuable thing is received\u201d).\n   At the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, the con-\ntemporary edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary included an\nexpansive definition of the term. See Black\u2019s Law Diction-\nary 1446 (3d ed. 1933). It stated that \u201c[t]he term is said to\nextend to every species of valuable right and interest. . . .\nThe word is also commonly used to denote everything\nwhich is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal,\ntangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal;\neverything that has an exchangeable value or which goes\nto make up wealth or estate.\u201d Id., at 1446\u20131447. And the\nlower courts have long given the term a similarly expan-\nsive construction. See, e.g., United States v. Tropiano,\n418 F. 2d 1069, 1075 (CA2 1969) (\u201cThe concept of prop-\nerty under the Hobbs Act . . . includes, in a broad sense,\nany valuable right considered as a source or element of\nwealth\u201d).\n   Despite the breadth of some of these formulations,\nhowever, the term \u201cproperty\u201d plainly does not reach every-\nthing that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to\neverything that might in some indirect way portend the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\npossibility of future economic gain. I do not suggest that\nthe current lower court case law is necessarily correct, but\nit seems clear that the case now before us is an outlier and\nthat the jury\u2019s verdict stretches the concept of property\nbeyond the breaking point.\n   It is not customary to refer to an internal recommenda-\ntion to make a government decision as a form of property.\nIt would seem strange to say that the government or its\nemployees have a property interest in their internal rec-\nommendations regarding such things as the issuance of\na building permit, the content of an environmental impact\nstatement, the approval of a new drug, or the indictment\nof an individual or a corporation. And it would be even\nstranger to say that a private party who might be affected\nby the government\u2019s decision can obtain a property inter-\nest in a recommendation to make the decision. See, e.g.,\nDoyle v. University of Alabama, 680 F. 2d 1323, 1326\n(CA11 1982) (\u201cDoyle had no protected property interest\nin the mere recommendation for a raise; thus she was not\nentitled to due process safeguards when the recommended\nraise was disapproved by the University\u201d).\n   Our decision in Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12\n(2000), supports the conclusion that internal recommenda-\ntions regarding government decisions are not property. In\nCleveland, we vacated a business owner\u2019s conviction under\nthe federal mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71341, for \u201cob-\ntaining money or property\u201d through misrepresentations\nmade in an application for a video poker license issued by\nthe State. We held that a video poker license is not prop-\nerty in the hands of the State. Cleveland, supra, at 15. I\ndo not suggest that the concepts of property under the\nmail fraud statute and the Hobbs Act are necessarily the\nsame. But surely a video poker license has a stronger\nclaim to be classified as property than a mere internal\nrecommendation that a state government take an initial\nstep that might lead eventually to an investment that\n4                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be beneficial to private parties.\n   The Government has not cited any Hobbs Act case\nholding that an internal recommendation regarding a gov-\nernment decision constitutes property. Nor has the Gov-\nernment cited any other example of the use of the term\n\u201cproperty\u201d in this sense.*\n   The Second Circuit recharacterized the property that\npetitioner attempted to obtain as the general counsel\u2019s\n\u201cright to make a recommendation consistent with his legal\njudgment.\u201d 683 F. 3d 436, 442 (2012). And the Govern-\nment also presses that theory in this Court. Brief for\nUnited States 15, 34\u201345. According to the Government,\nthe general counsel\u2019s property interest in his recommenda-\ntion encompasses the right to make the recommendation.\nId., at 35\u201336. But this argument assumes that the rec-\nommendation itself is property. See id., at 35 (the general\ncounsel\u2019s \u201c \u2018recommendation\u2019 and his \u2018right to make the\nrecommendation\u2019 are merely different expressions of the\nsame property\u201d). If an internal recommendation regarding\na government decision does not constitute property, then\nsurely a government employee\u2019s right to make such a\nrecommendation is not property either (nor could it be\ndeemed a property right).\n                           II\n  The Government argues that the recommendation was\nthe general counsel\u2019s personal property because it was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * To recognize that an internal recommendation regarding a govern-\nment decision is not property does not foreclose the possibility that\nthreatening a government employee, as the government\u2019s agent, in\norder to secure government property could qualify as Hobbs Act extor-\ntion. Here, after all, petitioner\u2019s ultimate goal was to secure an invest-\nment of money from the government. But the jury found only that\npetitioner had attempted to obtain the general counsel\u2019s recommenda-\ntion, so I have no occasion to consider whether a Hobbs Act conviction\ncould have been sustained on a different legal theory.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

But that argument is\nclearly wrong: If the general counsel had left the State\u2019s\nemploy before submitting the recommendation, he could\nnot have taken the recommendation with him, and he\ncertainly could not have given it or sold it to someone else.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the recommendation (and the\nright to make it) were inextricably related to the general\ncounsel\u2019s position with the government, and not to his\nbroader personal right to pursue the practice of law.\n   The general counsel\u2019s job surely had economic value to\nhim, as did his labor as a lawyer, his law license, and his\nreputation as an attorney. But the indictment did not\nallege, and the jury did not find, that petitioner attempted\nto obtain those things. Nor would such a theory make\nsense in the context of this case. Petitioner did not, for\nexample, seek the general counsel\u2019s legal advice or de-\nmand that the general counsel represent him in a legal\nproceeding. Cf. United States v. Thompson, 647 F. 3d 180,\n186\u2013187 (CA5 2011) (a person\u2019s labor is property capable\nof being extorted). Nor did petitioner attempt to enhance\nhis own ability to compete with the general counsel for\nlegal work by threatening to do something that would, say,\ntarnish the general counsel\u2019s reputation or cause his law\nlicense to be revoked. Cf. Tropiano, 418 F. 2d, at 1071\u2013\n1072, 1075\u20131077 (threats to competitor in order to obtain\ncustomers constitute extortion); United States v. Zemek,\n634 F. 2d 1159, 1173\u20131174 (CA9 1980) (same); United\nStates v. Coffey, 361 F. Supp. 2d 102, 108\u2013109 (EDNY\n2005) (the right to pursue a lawful business is extortable\nproperty under the Hobbs Act).\n   The Court holds that petitioner\u2019s conduct does not\namount to attempted extortion, but for a different reason:\nAccording to the Court, the alleged property that petition-\ner pursued was not transferrable and therefore is not\ncapable of being \u201cobtained.\u201d Ante, at 4\u20135, 7\u20138. Because I\n6                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndo not believe that the item in question constitutes prop-\nerty, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether or not\npetitioner sought to obtain it.\n                         *      *   *\n  If Congress had wanted to classify internal recommen-\ndations pertaining to government decisions as property,\nI think it would have spoken more clearly than it did in\nthe Hobbs Act. But even if the Hobbs Act were ambiguous\non this point, the rule of lenity would counsel in favor of an\ninterpretation of the statute that does not reach so broadly,\nsee Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003). This is not to say that the\nGovernment could not have prosecuted petitioner for ex-\ntortion on these same facts under some other theory.\nThe question before us is whether the general counsel\u2019s\nrecommendation\u2014or the right to make it\u2014constitutes\nproperty under the Hobbs Act. In my view, they do not.\n  For these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n",

Argued April 23, 2013\u2014Decided June 26, 2013\nInvestments for the employee pension fund of the State of New York\n  and its local governments are chosen by the fund\u2019s sole trustee, the\n  State Comptroller. After the Comptroller\u2019s general counsel recom-\n  mended against investing in a fund managed by FA Technology Ven-\n  tures, the general counsel received anonymous e-mails demanding\n  that he recommend the investment and threatening, if he did not, to\n  disclose information about the general counsel\u2019s alleged affair to his\n  wife, government officials, and the media. Some of the e-mails were\n  traced to the home computer of petitioner Sekhar, a managing part-\n  ner of FA Technology Ventures. Petitioner was convicted of attempt-\n  ed extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71951(a),\n  which defines \u201cextortion\u201d to mean \u201cthe obtaining of property from an-\n  other, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-\n  ened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right,\u201d\n  \u00a71951(b)(2). The jury specified that the property petitioner attempt-\n  ed to extort was the general counsel\u2019s recommendation to approve the\n  investment. The Second Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: Attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer\n approve an investment does not constitute \u201cthe obtaining of property\n from another\u201d under the Hobbs Act. Pp. 3\u20139.\n    (a) Absent other indication, \u201cCongress intends to incorporate the\n well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses.\u201d Neder v.\n United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23. As far as is known, no case predating\n the Hobbs Act\u2014English, federal, or state\u2014ever identified conduct\n such as that charged here as extortionate. Extortion required the ob-\n taining of items of value, typically cash, from the victim. The Act\u2019s\n text confirms that obtaining property requires \u201cnot only the depriva-\n2                     SEKHAR v.

The property extort-\n    ed must therefore be transferable\u2014that is, capable of passing from\n    one person to another, a defining feature lacking in the alleged prop-\n    erty here. The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\n    Congress borrowed nearly verbatim the definition of extortion from a\n    1909 New York statute but did not copy the coercion provision of that\n    statute. And in 1946, the time of the borrowing, New York courts\n    had consistently held that the sort of interference with rights that oc-\n    curred here was coercion. Finally, this Court\u2019s own precedent de-\n    mands reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions.

S. C. \u00a71951(b)(2).\n                              I\n  New York\u2019s Common Retirement Fund is an employee\npension fund for the State of New York and its local gov-\nernments. As sole trustee of the Fund, the State Comp-\ntroller chooses Fund investments. When the Comptroller\ndecides to approve an investment he issues a \u201cCommit-\nment.\u201d A Commitment, however, does not actually bind\nthe Fund. For that to happen, the Fund and the recipient\nof the investment must enter into a limited partnership\nagreement. 683 F. 3d 436, 438 (CA2 2012).\n  Petitioner Giridhar Sekhar was a managing partner of\nFA Technology Ventures. In October 2009, the Comptrol-\nler\u2019s office was considering whether to invest in a fund\nmanaged by that firm. The office\u2019s general counsel made a\nwritten recommendation to the Comptroller not to invest\nin the fund, after learning that the Office of the New York\n2                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nAttorney General was investigating another fund man-\naged by the firm. The Comptroller decided not to issue a\nCommitment and notified a partner of FA Technology\nVentures. That partner had previously heard rumors that\nthe general counsel was having an extramarital affair.\n   The general counsel then received a series of anony-\nmous e-mails demanding that he recommend moving for-\nward with the investment and threatening, if he did not,\nto disclose information about his alleged affair to his wife,\ngovernment officials, and the media. App. 59\u201361. The\ngeneral counsel contacted law enforcement, which traced\nsome of the e-mails to petitioner\u2019s home computer and\nother e-mails to offices of FA Technology Ventures.\n   Petitioner was indicted for, and a jury convicted him of,\nattempted extortion, in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18\nU. S. C. \u00a71951(a). That Act subjects a person to criminal\nliability if he \u201cin any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\naffects commerce or the movement of any article or com-\nmodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts\nor conspires so to do.\u201d \u00a71951(a). The Act defines \u201cextor-\ntion\u201d to mean \u201cthe obtaining of property from another,\nwith his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or\nthreatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.\u201d \u00a71951(b)(2).1 On the verdict form, the jury was\nasked to specify the property that petitioner attempted to\nextort: (1) \u201cthe Commitment\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Comptroller\u2019s ap-\nproval of the Commitment\u201d; or (3) \u201cthe General Counsel\u2019s\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 Petitioner was also convicted of several counts of interstate trans-\n\nmission of extortionate threats, in violation of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7875(d).\nUnder \u00a7875(d), a person is criminally liable if he, \u201cwith intent to extort\nfrom any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other\nthing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any com-\nmunication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation\nof the addressee.\u201d In this case, both parties concede that the definition\nof \u201cextortion\u201d under the Hobbs Act also applies to the \u00a7875(d) counts.\nWe express no opinion on the validity of that concession.\n                 Cite as: 570 U.

The jury chose only the third option.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed\nthe conviction. The court held that the general counsel\n\u201chad a property right in rendering sound legal advice to\nthe Comptroller and, specifically, to recommend\u2014free from\nthreats\u2014whether the Comptroller should issue a Com-\nmitment for [the funds].\u201d 683 F. 3d, at 441. The court\nconcluded that petitioner not only attempted to deprive\nthe general counsel of his \u201cproperty right,\u201d but that peti-\ntioner also \u201cattempted to exercise that right by forcing the\nGeneral Counsel to make a recommendation determined\nby [petitioner].\u201d Id., at 442.\n   We granted certiorari. 568 U.

United States, 527 U. S. 1, 23 (1999).\n    \u201c[W]here Congress borrows terms of art in which are\n    accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of cen-\n    turies of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the\n    cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed\n    word in the body of learning from which it was taken\n    and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial\n    mind unless otherwise instructed.\u201d Morissette v.\n    United States, 342 U.

Rev. 527, 537 (1947).\n   The Hobbs Act punishes \u201cextortion,\u201d one of the oldest\ncrimes in our legal tradition, see E. Coke, The Third Part\nof the Institutes of the Laws of England 148\u2013150 (1648)\n(reprint 2008). The crime originally applied only to extor-\ntionate action by public officials, but was later extended\nby statute to private extortion. See 4 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s\nCriminal Law \u00a7\u00a7695, 699 (14th ed. 1981). As far as is\nknown, no case predating the Hobbs Act\u2014English, federal,\nor state\u2014ever identified conduct such as that charged\nhere as extortionate. Extortion required the obtaining of\nitems of value, typically cash, from the victim. See, e.g.,\nPeople v. Whaley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N. Y. Sup.

See, e.g., King v. Burdett, 1 Ld. Raym.\n149, 91 Eng. Rep. 996 (K. B. 1696) (dictum) (extortion\nconsisted of the \u201ctaking of money for the use of the stalls,\u201d\nnot the deprivation of \u201cfree liberty to sell [one\u2019s] wares in\nthe market according to law\u201d).\n   The text of the statute at issue confirms that the\nalleged property here cannot be extorted. Enacted in 1946,\nthe Hobbs Act defines its crime of \u201cextortion\u201d as \u201cthe ob-\ntaining of property from another, with his consent, induced\nby wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence,\nor fear, or under color of official right.\u201d 18 U.

S. 393, 404 (2003) (citing United States v.\nEnmons, 410 U. S. 396, 400 (1973)). That is, it requires\nthat the victim \u201cpart with\u201d his property, R. Perkins & R.\nBoyce, Criminal Law 451 (3d ed. 1982), and that the extor-\ntionist \u201cgain possession\u201d of it, Scheidler, supra, at 403,\nn. 8; see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1682\n(2d ed. 1949) (defining \u201cobtain\u201d); Murray, Note, Protesters,\nExtortion, and Coercion: Preventing RICO from Chilling\nFirst Amendment Freedoms, 75 Notre Dame L. Rev. 691,\n706 (1999) (Murray). The property extorted must there-\nfore be transferable\u2014that is, capable of passing from one\nperson to another. The alleged property here lacks that\ndefining feature.2\n   The genesis of the Hobbs Act reinforces that conclusion.\nThe Act was modeled after \u00a7850 of the New York Penal\nLaw (1909), which was derived from the famous Field\nCode, a 19th-century model penal code, see 4 Commission-\ners of the Code, Penal Code of the State of New York \u00a7613,\np. 220 (1865) (reprint 1998). Congress borrowed, nearly\nverbatim, the New York statute\u2019s definition of extortion.\nSee Scheidler, 537 U. S., at 403. The New York statute\ncontained, in addition to the felony crime of extortion, a\nnew (that is to say, nonexistent at common law) misde-\nmeanor crime of coercion. Whereas the former required,\nas we have said, \u201c \u2018the criminal acquisition of . . . property,\u2019 \u201d\nibid., the latter required merely the use of threats \u201cto\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 It may well be proper under the Hobbs Act for the Government to\n\ncharge a person who obtains money by threatening a third party, who\nobtains funds belonging to a corporate or governmental entity by\nthreatening the entity\u2019s agent, see 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7408, p.\n334, and n. 3 (9th ed. 1923) (citing State v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1849)), or\nwho obtains \u201cgoodwill and customer revenues\u201d by threatening a market\ncompetitor, see, e.g., United States v. Zemek, 634 F. 2d 1159, 1173 (CA9\n1980). Each of these might be considered \u201cobtaining property from\nanother.\u201d We need not consider those situations, however, because the\nGovernment did not charge any of them here.\n6                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompel another person to do or to abstain from doing an\nact which such other such person has a legal right to do\nor to abstain from doing.\u201d N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7530 (1909),\nearlier codified in N. Y. Penal Code \u00a7653 (1881). Congress\ndid not copy the coercion provision. The omission must\nhave been deliberate, since it was perfectly clear that\nextortion did not include coercion. At the time of the\nborrowing (1946), New York courts had consistently held\nthat the sort of interference with rights that occurred here\nwas coercion. See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N. Y. 556,\n188 N. E. 62 (1933) (per curiam) (compelling store owner\nto become a member of a trade association and to remove\nadvertisements); People v. Scotti, 266 N. Y. 480, 195 N. E.\n162 (App. Div. 1934) (compelling victim to enter into\nagreement with union); People v. Kaplan, 240 App. Div.\n72, 74\u201375, 269 N. Y. S. 161, 163\u2013164, aff \u2019d, 264 N. Y. 675,\n191 N. E. 621 (1934) (compelling union members to drop\nlawsuits against union leadership).3\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 Also revealing, the New York code prohibited conspiracy \u201c[t]o pre-\n\nvent another from exercising a lawful trade or calling, or doing any\nother lawful act, by force, threats, intimidation.\u201d N. Y. Penal Law\n\u00a7580(5) (1909) (emphasis added). That separate codification, which Con-\ngress did not adopt, is further evidence that the New York crime of\nextortion (and hence the federal crime) did not reach interference with\na person\u2019s right to ply a lawful trade, similar to the right claimed here.\n   Seeking to extract something from the void, the Government relies\non cases that interpret a provision of the New York code defining\nthe kinds of threats that qualify as threats to do \u201cunlawful injury to the\nperson or property,\u201d which is what the extortion statute requires. See\nN. Y. Penal Code \u00a7553 (1881); N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7851 (1909). Those\ncases held that they include threats to injure a business by preventing\nthe return of workers from a strike, People v. Barondess, 133 N. Y. 649,\n31 N. E. 240, 241\u2013242 (1892) (per curiam), and threats to terminate a\nperson\u2019s employment, People ex rel. Short v. Warden, 145 App. Div. 861,\n130 N. Y. S. 698, 700\u2013701 (1911), aff\u2019d, 206 N. Y. 632, 99 N. E. 1116\n(1912) (per curiam). Those cases are entirely inapposite here, where\nthe issue is not what constitutes a qualifying threat but what consti-\ntutes obtainable property.\n                     Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)                     7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   And finally, this Court\u2019s own precedent similarly de-\nmands reversal of petitioner\u2019s convictions. In Scheidler,\nwe held that protesters did not commit extortion under the\nHobbs Act, even though they \u201cinterfered with, disrupted,\nand in some instances completely deprived\u201d abortion\nclinics of their ability to run their business. 537 U. S., at\n404\u2013405. We reasoned that the protesters may have\ndeprived the clinics of an \u201calleged property right,\u201d but they\ndid not pursue or receive \u201c \u2018something of value from\u2019 \u201d the\nclinics that they could then \u201cexercise, transfer, or sell\u201d\nthemselves. Id., at 405. The opinion supported its holding\nby citing the three New York coercion cases discussed\nabove. See id., at 405\u2013406.\n   This case is easier than Scheidler, where one might at\nleast have said that physical occupation of property\namounted to obtaining that property. The deprivation\nalleged here is far more abstract. Scheidler rested its\ndecision, as we do, on the term \u201cobtaining.\u201d Id., at 402,\nn. 6. The principle announced there\u2014that a defendant\nmust pursue something of value from the victim that can\nbe exercised, transferred, or sold\u2014applies with equal force\nhere.4 Whether one considers the personal right at issue\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 The  Government\u2019s attempt to distinguish Scheidler is unconvinc-\ning. In its view, had the protesters sought to force the clinics to pro-\nvide services other than abortion, extortion would have been a proper\ncharge. Petitioner committed extortion here, the Government says,\nbecause he did not merely attempt to prevent the general counsel from\ngiving a recommendation but tried instead to force him to issue one.\nThat distinction is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsensical. It is\ncoercion, not extortion, when a person is forced to do something and\nwhen he is forced to do nothing. See, e.g., N. Y. Penal Law \u00a7530 (1909)\n(it is a misdemeanor to coerce a \u201cperson to do or to abstain from doing\nan act\u201d). Congress\u2019s enactment of the Hobbs Act did not, through the\nphrase \u201cobtaining of property from another,\u201d suddenly transform every\nact that coerces affirmative conduct into a crime punishable for up to 20\nyears, while leaving those who \u201cmerely\u201d coerce inaction immune from\nfederal punishment.\n8                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nto be \u201cproperty\u201d in a broad sense or not, it certainly was\nnot obtainable property under the Hobbs Act.5\n                               B\n   The Government\u2019s shifting and imprecise characteriza-\ntion of the alleged property at issue betrays the weakness\nof its case. According to the jury\u2019s verdict form, the \u201cprop-\nerty\u201d that petitioner attempted to extort was \u201cthe General\nCounsel\u2019s recommendation to approve the Commitment.\u201d\nApp. 142. But the Government expends minuscule effort\nin defending that theory of conviction. And for good\nreason\u2014to wit, our decision in Cleveland v. United States,\n531 U. S. 12 (2000), which reversed a business owner\u2019s\nmail-fraud conviction for \u201cobtaining money or property\u201d\nthrough misrepresentations made in an application for a\nvideo-poker license issued by the State. We held that\na \u201clicense\u201d is not \u201cproperty\u201d while in the State\u2019s hands and\nso cannot be \u201cobtained\u201d from the State. Id., at 20\u201322.\nEven less so can an employee\u2019s yet-to-be-issued recom-\nmendation be called obtainable property, and less so still\na yet-to-be-issued recommendation that would merely ap-\nprove (but not effect) a particular investment.\n   Hence the Government\u2019s reliance on an alternative,\nmore sophisticated (and sophistic) description of the\nproperty. Instead of defending the jury\u2019s description, the Gov-\nernment hinges its case on the general counsel\u2019s \u201cintangi-\nble property right to give his disinterested legal opinion to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   5 The concurrence contends that the \u201cright to make [a] recommenda-\n\ntion\u201d is not property. Post, at 4 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). We\nare not sure of that. If one defines property to include anything of\nvalue, surely some rights to make recommendations would qualify\u2014for\nexample, a member of the Pulitzer Prize Committee\u2019s right to recom-\nmend the recipient of the prize. We suppose that a prominent journal-\nist would not give up that right (he cannot, of course, transfer it) for a\nsignificant sum of money\u2014so it must be valuable. But the point\nrelevant to the present case is that it cannot be transferred, so it cannot\nbe the object of extortion under the statute.\n                  Cite as: 570 U.

But what, exactly, would the petitioner\nhave obtained for himself? A right to give his own disin-\nterested legal opinion to his own client free of improper\ninterference? Or perhaps, a right to give the general coun-\nsel\u2019s disinterested legal opinion to the general counsel\u2019s\nclient?\n   Either formulation sounds absurd, because it is. Clearly,\npetitioner\u2019s goal was not to acquire the general coun-\nsel\u2019s \u201cintangible property right to give disinterested legal\nadvice.\u201d It was to force the general counsel to offer advice\nthat accorded with petitioner\u2019s wishes. But again, that is\ncoercion, not extortion. See Murray 721\u2013722. No fluent\nspeaker of English would say that \u201cpetitioner obtained\nand exercised the general counsel\u2019s right to make a rec-\nommendation,\u201d any more than he would say that a person\n\u201cobtained and exercised another\u2019s right to free speech.\u201d He\nwould say that \u201cpetitioner forced the general counsel to\nmake a particular recommendation,\u201d just as he would\nsay that a person \u201cforced another to make a statement.\u201d\nAdopting the Government\u2019s theory here would not only\nmake nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstand-\ning distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore\nCongress\u2019s choice to penalize one but not the other.

We must therefore decide\nwhether this nonbinding internal recommendation by a\nsalaried state employee constitutes \u201cproperty\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Hobbs Act, which defines \u201cextortion\u201d as\n\u201cthe obtaining of property from another, with his con-\nsent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened\nforce, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\u201d\n\u00a71951(b)(2).\n2                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   The Hobbs Act does not define the term \u201cproperty,\u201d but\neven at common law the offense of extortion was under-\nstood to include the obtaining of any thing of value. 2 E.\nCoke, The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of\nEngland 368b (18th English ed. 1823) (\u201cExtortion . . . is a\ngreat misprison, by wresting or unlawfully taking by any\nofficer, by colour of his office, any money or valuable thing\nof or from any man\u201d); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries\n*141 (extortion is \u201can abuse of public, justice which con-\nsists in any officer\u2019s unlawfully taking, by colour of his\noffice, from any man, any money or thing of value\u201d). See\nalso 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7401, pp. 331\u2013332 (9th ed.\n1923) (\u201cIn most cases, the thing obtained is money. . . . But\nprobably anything of value will suffice\u201d); 3 F. Wharton, A\nTreatise on Criminal Law \u00a71898, p. 2095 (11th ed. 1912)\n(\u201c[I]t is enough if any valuable thing is received\u201d).\n   At the time Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, the con-\ntemporary edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary included an\nexpansive definition of the term. See Black\u2019s Law Diction-\nary 1446 (3d ed. 1933). It stated that \u201c[t]he term is said to\nextend to every species of valuable right and interest. . . .\nThe word is also commonly used to denote everything\nwhich is the subject of ownership, corporeal or incorporeal,\ntangible or intangible, visible or invisible, real or personal;\neverything that has an exchangeable value or which goes\nto make up wealth or estate.\u201d Id., at 1446\u20131447. And the\nlower courts have long given the term a similarly expan-\nsive construction. See, e.g., United States v. Tropiano,\n418 F. 2d 1069, 1075 (CA2 1969) (\u201cThe concept of prop-\nerty under the Hobbs Act . . . includes, in a broad sense,\nany valuable right considered as a source or element of\nwealth\u201d).\n   Despite the breadth of some of these formulations,\nhowever, the term \u201cproperty\u201d plainly does not reach every-\nthing that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to\neverything that might in some indirect way portend the\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\npossibility of future economic gain. I do not suggest that\nthe current lower court case law is necessarily correct, but\nit seems clear that the case now before us is an outlier and\nthat the jury\u2019s verdict stretches the concept of property\nbeyond the breaking point.\n   It is not customary to refer to an internal recommenda-\ntion to make a government decision as a form of property.\nIt would seem strange to say that the government or its\nemployees have a property interest in their internal rec-\nommendations regarding such things as the issuance of\na building permit, the content of an environmental impact\nstatement, the approval of a new drug, or the indictment\nof an individual or a corporation. And it would be even\nstranger to say that a private party who might be affected\nby the government\u2019s decision can obtain a property inter-\nest in a recommendation to make the decision. See, e.g.,\nDoyle v. University of Alabama, 680 F. 2d 1323, 1326\n(CA11 1982) (\u201cDoyle had no protected property interest\nin the mere recommendation for a raise; thus she was not\nentitled to due process safeguards when the recommended\nraise was disapproved by the University\u201d).\n   Our decision in Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12\n(2000), supports the conclusion that internal recommenda-\ntions regarding government decisions are not property. In\nCleveland, we vacated a business owner\u2019s conviction under\nthe federal mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. \u00a71341, for \u201cob-\ntaining money or property\u201d through misrepresentations\nmade in an application for a video poker license issued by\nthe State. We held that a video poker license is not prop-\nerty in the hands of the State. Cleveland, supra, at 15. I\ndo not suggest that the concepts of property under the\nmail fraud statute and the Hobbs Act are necessarily the\nsame. But surely a video poker license has a stronger\nclaim to be classified as property than a mere internal\nrecommendation that a state government take an initial\nstep that might lead eventually to an investment that\n4                    SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\nwould be beneficial to private parties.\n   The Government has not cited any Hobbs Act case\nholding that an internal recommendation regarding a gov-\nernment decision constitutes property. Nor has the Gov-\nernment cited any other example of the use of the term\n\u201cproperty\u201d in this sense.*\n   The Second Circuit recharacterized the property that\npetitioner attempted to obtain as the general counsel\u2019s\n\u201cright to make a recommendation consistent with his legal\njudgment.\u201d 683 F. 3d 436, 442 (2012). And the Govern-\nment also presses that theory in this Court. Brief for\nUnited States 15, 34\u201345. According to the Government,\nthe general counsel\u2019s property interest in his recommenda-\ntion encompasses the right to make the recommendation.\nId., at 35\u201336. But this argument assumes that the rec-\nommendation itself is property. See id., at 35 (the general\ncounsel\u2019s \u201c \u2018recommendation\u2019 and his \u2018right to make the\nrecommendation\u2019 are merely different expressions of the\nsame property\u201d). If an internal recommendation regarding\na government decision does not constitute property, then\nsurely a government employee\u2019s right to make such a\nrecommendation is not property either (nor could it be\ndeemed a property right).\n                           II\n  The Government argues that the recommendation was\nthe general counsel\u2019s personal property because it was\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * To recognize that an internal recommendation regarding a govern-\nment decision is not property does not foreclose the possibility that\nthreatening a government employee, as the government\u2019s agent, in\norder to secure government property could qualify as Hobbs Act extor-\ntion. Here, after all, petitioner\u2019s ultimate goal was to secure an invest-\nment of money from the government. But the jury found only that\npetitioner had attempted to obtain the general counsel\u2019s recommenda-\ntion, so I have no occasion to consider whether a Hobbs Act conviction\ncould have been sustained on a different legal theory.\n                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ninextricably related to his right to pursue his profession as\nan attorney. See id., at 34\u201335. But that argument is\nclearly wrong: If the general counsel had left the State\u2019s\nemploy before submitting the recommendation, he could\nnot have taken the recommendation with him, and he\ncertainly could not have given it or sold it to someone else.\nTherefore, it is obvious that the recommendation (and the\nright to make it) were inextricably related to the general\ncounsel\u2019s position with the government, and not to his\nbroader personal right to pursue the practice of law.\n   The general counsel\u2019s job surely had economic value to\nhim, as did his labor as a lawyer, his law license, and his\nreputation as an attorney. But the indictment did not\nallege, and the jury did not find, that petitioner attempted\nto obtain those things. Nor would such a theory make\nsense in the context of this case. Petitioner did not, for\nexample, seek the general counsel\u2019s legal advice or de-\nmand that the general counsel represent him in a legal\nproceeding. Cf. United States v. Thompson, 647 F. 3d 180,\n186\u2013187 (CA5 2011) (a person\u2019s labor is property capable\nof being extorted). Nor did petitioner attempt to enhance\nhis own ability to compete with the general counsel for\nlegal work by threatening to do something that would, say,\ntarnish the general counsel\u2019s reputation or cause his law\nlicense to be revoked. Cf. Tropiano, 418 F. 2d, at 1071\u2013\n1072, 1075\u20131077 (threats to competitor in order to obtain\ncustomers constitute extortion); United States v. Zemek,\n634 F. 2d 1159, 1173\u20131174 (CA9 1980) (same); United\nStates v. Coffey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2500085\"><a href=\"/nyed/dPbV/united-states-v-coffey/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Because I\n6                SEKHAR v. UNITED STATES\n\n                ALITO, J., concurring in judgment\n\ndo not believe that the item in question constitutes prop-\nerty, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether or not\npetitioner sought to obtain it.\n                         *      *   *\n  If Congress had wanted to classify internal recommen-\ndations pertaining to government decisions as property,\nI think it would have spoken more clearly than it did in\nthe Hobbs Act. But even if the Hobbs Act were ambiguous\non this point, the rule of lenity would counsel in favor of an\ninterpretation of the statute that does not reach so broadly,\nsee Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc.,\n537 U. S. 393, 409 (2003). This is not to say that the\nGovernment could not have prosecuted petitioner for ex-\ntortion on these same facts under some other theory.\nThe question before us is whether the general counsel\u2019s\nrecommendation\u2014or the right to make it\u2014constitutes\nproperty under the Hobbs Act. In my view, they do not.\n  For these reasons, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.\n</pre>",
