United States,\n570 U.S. ___ (2013).\n   JUSTICE ALITO, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY joins,\ndissenting.\n   The Court\u2019s decision to grant, vacate, and remand shows\nthat the Court\u2019s elaboration of its \u201cmodified categorical\u201d\napproach has completely lost touch with reality.\n   In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nheld that petitioner qualifies as a career offender for pur-\nposes of the United States Sentencing Commission, Guide-\nlines Manual \u00a74B1.1 (Nov. 2012), based in part on a prior\nconviction under Pennsylvania law for simple assault, Pa.\nStat.

United States,\nante, at 1\u20132, 6. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, the mod-\nified categorical approach applies to divisible statutes, see\nante, at 6, 23, and courts applying that approach may\nconsult the plea colloquy to \u201cdetermin[e] which statutory\nphrase . . . covered a prior conviction,\u201d Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 U. S. 29, 41 (2009); see Shepard v. United States,\n544 U. S. 13, 20 (2005).\n   When petitioner pleaded guilty, this is what was said:\n    \u201c \u2018[Assistant District Attorney]: On . . . April 27, 2004,\n    . . . [petitioner] grabbed Mrs. Marrero by the neck, at-\n    tempting to drag her upstairs to the second floor.\n    When she tried to make a phone call, he ripped the\n    phone cord out of the wall as she was attempting to\n    call 911.\u2019 \u201d\n    \u201c \u2018The Court: Do you admit those facts?\u2019 \u201d\n    \u201c \u2018The Defendant: Yes, Sir.\u2019 \u201d 677 F. 3d, at 158 (quoting\n    plea colloquy).\n  In sending this case back to the Third Circuit for a\nsecond look, this Court is apparently troubled by the pos-\nsibility that petitioner was convicted merely for reck-\nless conduct, and it is of course true that he did not say\nexpressly that he intentionally or knowingly grabbed Mrs.\nMarrero by the neck or that he intentionally or knowingly\nattempted to drag her up a flight of stairs. The Court may\nbe entertaining the possibility that what petitioner meant\nwas that he grabbed what he believed to be some inani-\nmate object with a neck\u2014perhaps a mannequin named\nMrs. Marrero\u2014and attempted to drag that object up the\nsteps. In that event, his conduct might have been merely\nreckless and not intentional or knowing.\n  The remand in this case is pointless. I would deny the\npetition and therefore dissent.\n",
