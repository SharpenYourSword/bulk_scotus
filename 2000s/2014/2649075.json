HOOD, ATTORNEY GENERAL v.\n           AU OPTRONICS CORP. ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12\u20131036. Argued November 6, 2013\u2014Decided January 14, 2014\nCongress enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) to low-\n  er diversity jurisdiction requirements in class actions and, as rele-\n  vant here, in mass actions, i.e., civil actions \u201cin which monetary relief\n  claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the\n  ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions of law or\n  fact,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). Petitioner Mississippi sued re-\n  spondent liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers in state court,\n  alleging violations of state law and seeking, inter alia, restitution for\n  LCD purchases made by itself and its citizens. Respondents sought\n  to remove the case to federal court. The District Court held that the\n  suit qualified as a mass action under \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i), but remand-\n  ed the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within CAFA\u2019s\n  \u201cgeneral public\u201d exception, \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III). The Fifth Circuit\n  reversed, agreeing with the District Court that the suit was a mass\n  action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.\nHeld: Because Mississippi is the only named plaintiff, this suit does not\n constitute a mass action under CAFA. Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) Contrary to respondents\u2019 argument, CAFA\u2019s \u201c100 or more per-\n sons\u201d phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real par-\n ties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs. Congress knew\n how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning,\n see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(5)(B), 1332(d)(1)(D). That it did not do so in the\n mass action provision indicates that Congress did not want the provi-\n sion\u2019s numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed\n individuals who possess an interest in the suit.\n    Respondents\u2019 understanding also cannot be reconciled with the fact\n that the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d are not unspecified individuals with\n2        MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    no participation in the suit but are the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d subsequently re-\n    ferred to in the provision, i.e., the very parties proposing to join their\n    claims in a single trial. This is evident in two key ways. First, CAFA\n    uses \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d the same way they are used in Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 20, which refers to \u201cpersons\u201d as individuals\n    who are proposing to join as \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in a single action. Second, it\n    is difficult to imagine how the \u201cclaims of 100 or more\u201d unnamed indi-\n    viduals could be \u201cproposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the\n    . . . claims\u201d of some completely different group of named plaintiffs\n    \u201cinvolve common questions of law or fact.\u201d\n        Construing \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to include both named and unnamed real\n    parties in interest would stretch the meaning of \u201cplaintiff\u201d beyond\n    recognition. A \u201cplaintiff\u201d is commonly understood to be a party who\n    brings a civil suit in a court of law, not anyone, named or unnamed,\n    whom a suit may benefit. Moreover, respondents\u2019 definition would\n    also have to apply to the mass action provision\u2019s subsequent refer-\n    ence to \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in the phrase \u201cjurisdiction shall exist only over\n    those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000],\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n    See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118. This would result in an\n    administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have in-\n    tended, see Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 575,\n    where district courts would have to identify hundreds (or in this case,\n    hundreds of thousands) of unnamed parties whose claims are for less\n    than $75,000 and then decide how to dispose of their claims. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n        (b) Statutory context reinforces this Court\u2019s reading of the mass ac-\n    tion provision. CAFA provides that once removal occurs, a case shall\n    not be transferred to another court \u201cunless a majority of the plaintiffs\n    in the action request transfer.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(C)(i). If \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in-\n    cluded unnamed parties, it would be surpassingly difficult for a court\n    to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide\n    whether an action may be transferred. Moreover, respondents\u2019 posi-\n    tion that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a\n    class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions\n    largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\u2019s relaxed class action ju-\n    risdictional rules cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of\n    plaintiffs rather than using the class device. Had Congress wanted\n    CAFA to authorize removal of representative actions brought by\n    States as sole plaintiffs on respondents\u2019 theory, it would have done so\n    through the class action provision, not the mass action provision.\n    Pp. 10\u201311.\n        (c) This Court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to\n    require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to en-\n    sure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

S. 176, 185\u2013186, but Congress did not intend this background\n  inquiry to apply to the mass action provision. First, it could make\n  sense to incorporate the background inquiry into the mass action\n  provision if the inquiry had previously been applied in a similar\n  manner. That is not the case here, however, and so any presumption\n  that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists at all,\n  would be comparatively weak. Second, even if the background prin-\n  ciple had previously been applied in this manner, Congress expressly\n  indicated that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass ac-\n  tion provision both through the textual indicators described above\n  and by prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a\n  lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II).\n  Requiring district courts to identify unnamed persons interested in\n  the suit would run afoul of that intent.

JIM HOOD, ATTORNEY \n\n      GENERAL, PETITIONER v. AU OPTRONICS \n\n               CORPORATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 14, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA or\nAct), defendants in civil suits may remove \u201cmass actions\u201d\nfrom state to federal court. CAFA defines a \u201cmass action\u201d\nas \u201cany civil action . . . in which monetary relief claims of\n100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the\nground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common ques-\ntions of law or fact.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). The\nquestion presented is whether a suit filed by a State as the\nsole plaintiff constitutes a \u201cmass action\u201d under CAFA\nwhere it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries\nsuffered by the State\u2019s citizens. We hold that it does not.\nAccording to CAFA\u2019s plain text, a \u201cmass action\u201d must\ninvolve monetary claims brought by 100 or more persons\nwho propose to try those claims jointly as named plain-\ntiffs. Because the State of Mississippi is the only named\nplaintiff in the instant action, the case must be remanded\nto state court.\n2     MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress enacted CAFA in order to \u201camend the proce-\ndures that apply to consideration of interstate class ac-\ntions.\u201d 119 Stat. 4. In doing so, Congress recognized that\n\u201c[c]lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part\nof the legal system.\u201d CAFA \u00a72. It was concerned, however,\nthat certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdic-\ntion, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, had functioned to \u201ckee[p] cases of\nnational importance\u201d in state courts rather than federal\ncourts. CAFA \u00a72.\n   CAFA accordingly loosened the requirements for diver-\nsity jurisdiction for two types of cases\u2014\u201cclass actions\u201d and\n\u201cmass actions.\u201d The Act defines \u201cclass action\u201d to mean\n\u201cany civil action filed under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure or similar State statute or rule of judicial\nprocedure.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(1)(B). And it defines\n\u201cmass action\u201d to mean \u201cany civil action . . . in which mone-\ntary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed\nto be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims involve common questions of law or fact.\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n   For class and mass actions, CAFA expanded diversity\njurisdiction in two key ways. First, it replaced the ordi-\nnary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship\namong all plaintiffs and defendants, see State Farm Fire\n& Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530\u2013531 (1967),\nwith a requirement of minimal diversity. Under that re-\nquirement, a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a\nclass action if \u201cany member of a class of plaintiffs is\na citizen of a State different from any defendant.\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(2)(A). The same rule applies to mass actions.\nSee \u00a71332(d)(11)(A) (\u201c[A] mass action shall be deemed . . .\nremovable under [\u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2) through (d)(10)]\u201d). Second,\nwhereas \u00a71332(a) ordinarily requires each plaintiff\u2019s claim\nto exceed the sum or value of $75,000, see Exxon Mobil\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 554\u2013555\n(2005), CAFA grants federal jurisdiction over class and\nmass actions in which the aggregate amount in contro-\nversy exceeds $5 million. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), (d)(6), (d)(11)(A).\nClass and mass actions filed in state court that satisfy\nCAFA\u2019s requirements may be removed to federal court, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71453, but federal jurisdiction in a mass action,\nunlike a class action, \u201cshall exist only over those plaintiffs\u201d\nwhose claims individually satisfy the $75,000 amount in\ncontroversy requirement, \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).1\n                              B\n   Respondents manufacture liquid crystal displays, or\nLCDs. In March 2011, the State of Mississippi sued them\nin state court, alleging that they had formed an interna-\ntional cartel to restrict competition and raise prices in\nthe LCD market. The State claimed that these actions vio-\nlated two Mississippi statutes: the Mississippi Antitrust Act,\nMiss. Code Ann. \u00a775\u201321\u20131 et seq. (2009), and the Missis-\nsippi Consumer Protection Act, \u00a775\u201324\u20131 et seq. (2009 and\nCum. Supp. 2013). The State sought injunctive relief and\ncivil penalties under both statutes, along with punitive\ndamages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. It also sought restitu-\ntion for its own purchases \u201cof LCD products and the pur-\nchases of its citizens.\u201d App. to Brief in Opposition 65a;\n\u00a775\u201324\u201311.\n   Respondents filed a notice to remove the case from state\nto federal court, arguing that the case was removable\nunder CAFA as either a \u201cclass action\u201d or a \u201cmass action.\u201d\nThe District Court ruled that the suit did not qualify as\na \u201cclass action\u201d because it was \u201cnot brought pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or a \u2018similar State\nstatute or rule of judicial procedure.\u2019 \u201d 876 F. Supp. 2d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 CAFA provides certain exceptions for class actions that involve mat-\n\nters of principally local or state concern. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(3)\u2013\n(5). None of them are at issue in this case.\n4        MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n758, 769 (SD Miss. 2012). But it held that the suit did\nqualify as a \u201cmass action,\u201d because \u201c[i]t is a civil action \u2018in\nwhich monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are\nproposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions of law or fact.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 771. The District Court reached that conclusion on the\nbasis of Fifth Circuit precedent in Louisiana ex rel. Cald-\nwell v. Allstate Ins. Co., 536 F. 3d 418 (CA5 2008), which it\nunderstood to \u201cstan[d] for the proposition that the words\n\u2018persons\u2019 and \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 in [the mass action definition] are\nto be defined as \u2018real parties in interest.\u2019 \u201d 876 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 771. Applying that rule, the court found that 100 or\nmore unidentified Mississippi consumers had purchased\nLCD screens and were therefore real parties in interest to\nthe State\u2019s restitution claim. Ibid. The court noted the\n\u201cpossibility that a \u2018mass action\u2019 should be thought of as a\n\u2018mass joinder,\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, as a suit involving 100 or more\n\u201cnamed plaintiffs.\u201d Ibid., n. 9. But it deemed that inter-\npretation to be foreclosed by Caldwell.\n   The District Court nonetheless remanded the case to\nstate court on the basis of CAFA\u2019s \u201cgeneral public excep-\ntion,\u201d which excludes from the \u201cmass action\u201d definition\n\u201cany civil action in which . . . all of the claims in the action\nare asserted on behalf of the general public (and not on\nbehalf of individual claimants or members of a purported\nclass) pursuant to a State statute specifically authorizing\nsuch action.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed. 701 F. 3d 796 (CA5\n2012). It agreed with the District Court\u2019s determination\nthat Mississippi\u2019s suit is not a \u201cclass action\u201d under CAFA.2\nId., at 799. It also agreed that, under Caldwell, the suit\nqualifies as a \u201cmass action\u201d because \u201c[t]he real parties in\ninterest in Mississippi\u2019s suit are those more than 100 . . .\nindividual citizens who purchased the [LCD] products\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Respondents   do not challenge this ruling before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

It disagreed, how-\never, with the District Court\u2019s ruling that the suit falls\nwithin the general public exception. Id., at 802\u2013803.3\nJudge Elrod concurred in the judgment, noting that after\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in Caldwell, three Courts of\nAppeals had deemed similar lawsuits not to be mass ac-\ntions removable under CAFA.4 We granted certiorari to\nresolve this split of authority, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), and\nnow reverse.\n                              II\n\n                              A\n\n  Our analysis begins with the statutory text. Sebelius v.\nCloer, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6). The statute\nprovides:\n     \u201c[T]he term mass action means any civil action (except\n     a [class action]) in which monetary relief claims of 100\n     or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on\n     the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common\n     questions of law or fact, except that jurisdiction shall\n     exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass\n     action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements\n     under subsection (a).\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n  The parties do not dispute that this provision encom-\npasses suits that are brought jointly by 100 or more\nnamed plaintiffs who propose to try their claims together.\nThe question is whether the provision also includes suits\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court of Appeals did so on the rationale that because individual\n\nMississippi consumers are real parties in interest to the State\u2019s restitu-\ntion claim, the general public exception\u2019s requirement that \u201call of\nthe claims\u201d must be \u201casserted on behalf of the general public (and not\non behalf of individual claimants)\u201d was not satisfied. 28 U.

AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought by fewer than 100 named plaintiffs on the theory\nthat there may be 100 or more unnamed persons who are\nreal parties in interest as beneficiaries to any of the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims. Respondents argue that the provision covers\nsuch suits because \u201cclaims of 100 or more persons\u201d refers\nto \u201cthe persons to whom the claim belongs, i.e., the real\nparties in interest to the claims,\u201d regardless of whether\nthose persons are named or unnamed. Brief for Respond-\nents 19 (emphasis in original). We disagree.\n   To start, the statute says \u201c100 or more persons,\u201d not\n\u201c100 or more named or unnamed real parties in interest.\u201d\nHad Congress intended the latter, it easily could have\ndrafted language to that effect. Indeed, when Congress\nwanted a numerosity requirement in CAFA to be satisfied\nby counting unnamed parties in interest in addition to\nnamed plaintiffs, it explicitly said so: CAFA provides that\nin order for a class action to be removable, \u201cthe number\nof members of all proposed plaintiff classes\u201d must be 100\nor greater, \u00a71332(d)(5)(B), and it defines \u201cclass members\u201d\nto mean \u201cthe persons (named or unnamed) who fall within\nthe definition of the proposed or certified class,\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(1)(D). Congress chose not to use the phrase\n\u201cnamed or unnamed\u201d in CAFA\u2019s mass action provision, a\ndecision we understand to be intentional. See Dean v.\nUnited States, 556 U. S. 568, 573 (2009) (\u201c \u2018[W]here Con-\ngress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\u2019 \u201d).\n   More fundamentally, respondents\u2019 interpretation cannot\nbe reconciled with the fact that the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d\nreferred to in the statute are not unspecified individuals\nwho have no actual participation in the suit, but instead\nthe very \u201cplaintiffs\u201d referred to later in the sentence\u2014the\nparties who are proposing to join their claims in a single\ntrial. Congress made this understanding evident in two\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nkey ways.\n   First, we presume that \u201c \u2018Congress is aware of existing\nlaw when it passes legislation.\u2019 \u201d Hall v. United States,\n566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 9). Here, Congress\nused the terms \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d just as they are\nused in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, governing\nparty joinder. Where \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i) requires that the\n\u201cclaims of 100 or more persons [must be] proposed to be\ntried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in-\nvolve common questions of law or fact,\u201d Rule 20 provides\nthat \u201c[p]ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they\nassert any right to relief jointly . . . and any question of\nlaw or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the ac-\ntion.\u201d Thus, just as it is used in Rule 20, the term \u201cper-\nsons\u201d in \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i) refers to the individuals who\nare proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.\n   Second, respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u201cpersons\u201d cannot\nsquare with the statute\u2019s requirement that the claims of\nthe \u201c100 or more persons\u201d must be proposed for joint trial\n\u201con the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common\nquestions of law or fact.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). It is difficult\nto imagine how the claims of one set of unnamed individ-\nuals could be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the\nclaims of some completely different group of named plain-\ntiffs share common questions. The better understanding\nis that Congress meant for the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d and\nthe proposed \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to be one and the same.\n   Recognizing that the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cpersons\u201d\ncould be a reference to proposed plaintiffs, respondents\nassert that \u201cplaintiffs,\u201d like \u201cpersons,\u201d should be construed\nto \u201cinclud[e] both named and unnamed real parties in in-\nterest.\u201d Brief for Respondents 24. But that stretches\nthe meaning of \u201cplaintiff\u201d beyond recognition. The term\n\u201cplaintiff\u201d is among the most commonly understood of\nlegal terms of art: It means a \u201cparty who brings a civil suit\nin a court of law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed.\n8      MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary 1729 (1961) (defining \u201cplaintiff\u201d to mean \u201cone who\ncommences a personal action or lawsuit,\u201d or \u201cthe complain-\ning party in any litigation\u201d). It certainly does not mean\n\u201canyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit,\u201d as\nrespondents suggest.5\n   Moreover, Congress used the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d twice in\nthe mass action provision. The provision encompasses\nactions in which monetary \u201cclaims of 100 or more persons\nare proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions,\u201d and it then\nprovides that \u201cjurisdiction shall exist only over those\nplaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the juris-\ndictional amount requiremen[t]\u201d of $75,000.          \u00a71332(d)\n(11)(B)(i). If respondents are correct that \u201cplaintiffs\u201d\nmeans unnamed parties in interest where it is used the\nfirst time, then so too the second. After all, the \u201cpre-\nsumption that a given term is used to mean the same\nthing throughout a statute\u201d is \u201cat its most vigorous when a\nterm is repeated within a given sentence.\u201d Brown v.\nGardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n   Yet if the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d is stretched to include all\nunnamed individuals with an interest in the suit, then\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i)\u2019s requirement that \u201cjurisdiction shall\nexist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed\n$75,000]\u201d becomes an administrative nightmare that\nCongress could not possibly have intended, see Griffin v.\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 575 (1982). How\nis a district court to identify the unnamed parties whose\nclaims in a given case are for less than $75,000? Would\nthe court in this case, for instance, have to hold an eviden-\ntiary hearing to determine the identity of each of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Congress could of course require a real party in interest inquiry in a\n\nstatute that uses the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d simply by saying so. But it has\nnot done that here.\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nhundreds of thousands of unnamed Mississippi citizens\nwho purchased one of respondents\u2019 LCD products between\n1996 and 2006 (the period alleged in the complaint)? Even\nif it could identify every such person, how would it ascer-\ntain the amount in controversy for each individual claim?\nRespondents suggest that \u201c[i]n some circumstances, de-\nfendants may be able to identify from their payment rec-\nords any persons who may have claims for overpayments,\u201d\nbut they stop notably short of claiming to possess such\ndecades-old records themselves. Brief for Respondents 25.\n   Furthermore, what would happen with individuals\nwhose claims were valued at less than $75,000? The\nDistrict Court in this case suggested that if the suit were\ndeemed a mass action, it would sever the claim for \u201cresti-\ntution for losses incurred by individuals claiming less than\nor equal to $75,000 each\u201d and remand that claim back to\nstate court, while allowing the other claims (including the\nrestitution claims exceeding $75,000) to proceed in federal\ncourt. 876 F. Supp. 2d, at 775. Even respondents do not\ndefend that outcome, presumably because it would mean\nthat much of the State\u2019s lawsuit could proceed in state\ncourt after all, simultaneously with the newly severed\nparallel federal action.6\n   We think it unlikely that Congress intended that federal\ndistrict courts engage in these unwieldy inquiries. By\ncontrast, interpreting \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in accordance with its\nusual meaning\u2014to refer to the actual named parties who\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Respondents suggest that a district court might be able to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the claims that fall beneath $75,000,\nthereby avoiding the problem of identifying and remanding such claims\nto the state court. We need not decide the issue here, but we note that\nat least one Court of Appeals has rejected that view. See Lowery v.\nAlabama Power Co., 483 F. 3d 1184, 1206, n. 51 (CA11 2007) (holding\nthat because supplemental jurisdiction does not apply where a federal\nstatute \u201c \u2018expressly provide[s] otherwise,\u2019 \u201d 28 U.

HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbring an action\u2014leads to a straightforward, easy to ad-\nminister rule under which a court would examine whether\nthe plaintiffs have pleaded in good faith the requisite\namount. See Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367 U. S.\n348, 353 (1961). Our decision thus comports with the\ncommonsense observation that \u201cwhen judges must decide\njurisdictional matters, simplicity is a virtue.\u201d See Stand-\nard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 6).\n                               B\n   Our reading of the mass action provision\u2019s text is rein-\nforced by the statutory context. See Mohamad v. Palestin-\nian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20136).\n   First, the provision of CAFA governing transfer motions\nconfirms our view that the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d refers to actual\nnamed parties as opposed to unnamed real parties in\ninterest. That provision, \u00a71332(d)(11)(C)(i), provides that\nonce a mass action has been removed to federal court, it\n\u201cshall not thereafter be transferred to any other court . . .\nunless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request\ntransfer.\u201d If respondents are correct that \u201cplaintiffs\u201d\nmeans \u201cunnamed parties in interest,\u201d it will be surpass-\ningly difficult for a court to decide in a case like this one\nwhether an action may be transferred. The District Court\nitself acknowledged this problem, noting that it would\nhave to identify and communicate with \u201chundreds of thou-\nsands if not millions of real parties in interest\u201d to \u201cpol[l]\n[them] about their preferred forum\u201d if respondents\u2019 inter-\npretation were correct. 876 F. Supp. 2d, at 777.\n   The context in which the mass action provision was\nenacted lends further support to our conclusion. Congress\u2019\noverriding concern in enacting CAFA was with class ac-\ntions. See Preamble, 119 Stat. 4 (describing CAFA as an\n\u201c[a]ct to amend the procedures that apply to consideration\nof interstate class actions\u201d); CAFA \u00a72 (Congress\u2019 findings\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwith respect to class actions). The mass action provision\nthus functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\u2019s\nrelaxed jurisdictional rules for class actions cannot be\nevaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather\nthan using the class device. Respondents\u2019 argument fails\nto recognize this key distinction. Their position is ulti-\nmately that \u201c[t]his action is similar to a class action,\u201d such\nthat it should be removed. Brief for Respondents 27. But\nif Congress had wanted representative actions brought by\nStates as sole plaintiffs to be removable under CAFA on\nthe theory that they are in substance no different from\nclass actions, it would have done so through the class\naction provision, not the one governing mass actions.7\n                             III\n   Rather than relying on the text of CAFA as the source of\nits real party in interest inquiry, the Court of Appeals\nappeared to find such an inquiry necessary on the basis of\nwhat it understood to be a background principle: that\n\u201cfederal courts look to the substance of the action and not\nonly at the labels that the parties may attach.\u201d Caldwell,\n536 F. 3d, at 424. This was error.\n   We have interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to\nrequire courts in certain contexts to look behind the plead-\nings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or\ndestroying diversity jurisdiction. We have held, for exam-\nple, that a plaintiff may not keep a case out of federal\ncourt by fraudulently naming a nondiverse defendant.\nWecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co., 204 U. S.\n176, 185\u2013186 (1907). Nor may a plaintiff create diversity\nby collusively assigning his interest in an action. Kramer\nv. Caribbean Mills, Inc., 394 U. S. 823, 825\u2013830 (1969);\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  parties both point to the \u201cgeneral public exception,\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III), in support of their respective positions. But\nbecause the foregoing arguments resolve this case, we need not con-\nstrue that provision here.\n12    MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also 28 U. S. C. \u00a71359. And in cases involving a State\nor state official, we have inquired into the real party in\ninterest because a State\u2019s presence as a party will destroy\ncomplete diversity. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Missouri\nRailroad and Warehouse Comm\u2019rs, 183 U. S. 53, 58\u201359\n(1901).\n  But the question in this case is not simply whether\nthere exists some background principle of analyzing the\nreal parties in interest to a suit; the question is whether\nCongress intended that courts engage in that analysis\nwhen deciding whether a suit is a mass action. Recogniz-\ning this fact, respondents do not argue that the real party\nin interest inquiry employed in the above cases somehow\nsupersedes the text of CAFA; they instead argue that we\nshould read CAFA in light of those cases because \u201c \u2018Con-\ngress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with\nthis Court\u2019s precedents.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 19 (quot-\ning United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495 (1997)). For\ntwo reasons, however, we conclude that Congress did not\nintend the background inquiry to apply to the mass action\nprovision.\n  First, it makes sense to infer Congress\u2019 intent to incor-\nporate a background principle into a new statute where\nthe principle has previously been applied in a similar\nmanner. But that is not the case here. The background\nreal party in interest inquiry identifies what party\u2019s (or\nparties\u2019) citizenship should be considered in determining\ndiversity. The inquiry that respondents urge is quite dif-\nferent: It is an attempt to count up additional unnamed\nparties in order to satisfy the mass action provision\u2019s\nnumerosity requirement. Respondents offer no reason to\nbelieve that Congress intended to extend the real party\ninquiry to this new circumstance, and so any presumption\nthat Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it\nexists in this case at all, would be comparatively weak. Cf.\nMeyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 286 (2003) (\u201cCongress\u2019\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsilence, while permitting an inference that Congress in-\ntended to apply ordinary background tort principles,\ncannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modifi-\ncation of those rules\u201d).8\n   Second, even if the background principle had previously\nbeen applied in the manner sought by respondents, Con-\ngress provided express indications that it did not want the\nprinciple to apply to the mass action provision. It speci-\nfied that \u201cthe term \u2018mass action\u2019 shall not include any civil\naction in which . . . the claims are joined upon motion of a\ndefendant.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II). By prohibiting de-\nfendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in\norder to turn it into a mass action, Congress demonstrated\nits focus on the persons who are actually proposing to join\ntogether as named plaintiffs in the suit. Requiring district\ncourts to pierce the pleadings to identify unnamed persons\ninterested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.\nMoreover, as already discussed, Congress repeatedly used\nthe word \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to describe the 100 or more persons\nwhose claims must be proposed for a joint trial. That word\nrefers to actual, named parties\u2014a concept inherently at\nodds with the background inquiry into unnamed real\nparties in interest, who by definition are never plaintiffs.\nCongress thus clearly displaced a background real party in\ninterest inquiry, even assuming one might otherwise\napply. Cf. Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438,\n459, n. 16 (2002).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We have also applied a real party in interest inquiry in contexts\n\nother than that of determining citizenship for purposes of diversity\njurisdiction. See North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 374\u2013376\n(1923) (state sovereign immunity); Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook,\n304 U. S. 387, 392\u2013393 (1938) (original jurisdiction). But even if we\nwere to indulge in a presumption that Congress somehow intended to\nimport the inquiry applied in those particular contexts into the mass\naction provision\u2019s distinct numerosity requirement, we would find any\nsuch presumption overridden by CAFA\u2019s text.\n14    MISSISSIPPI EX REL.

Argued November 6, 2013\u2014Decided January 14, 2014\nCongress enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) to low-\n  er diversity jurisdiction requirements in class actions and, as rele-\n  vant here, in mass actions, i.e., civil actions \u201cin which monetary relief\n  claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the\n  ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions of law or\n  fact,\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). Petitioner Mississippi sued re-\n  spondent liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers in state court,\n  alleging violations of state law and seeking, inter alia, restitution for\n  LCD purchases made by itself and its citizens. Respondents sought\n  to remove the case to federal court. The District Court held that the\n  suit qualified as a mass action under \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i), but remand-\n  ed the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within CAFA\u2019s\n  \u201cgeneral public\u201d exception, \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III). The Fifth Circuit\n  reversed, agreeing with the District Court that the suit was a mass\n  action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.\nHeld: Because Mississippi is the only named plaintiff, this suit does not\n constitute a mass action under CAFA. Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) Contrary to respondents\u2019 argument, CAFA\u2019s \u201c100 or more per-\n sons\u201d phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real par-\n ties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs. Congress knew\n how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning,\n see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(5)(B), 1332(d)(1)(D). That it did not do so in the\n mass action provision indicates that Congress did not want the provi-\n sion\u2019s numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed\n individuals who possess an interest in the suit.\n    Respondents\u2019 understanding also cannot be reconciled with the fact\n that the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d are not unspecified individuals with\n2        MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    no participation in the suit but are the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d subsequently re-\n    ferred to in the provision, i.e., the very parties proposing to join their\n    claims in a single trial. This is evident in two key ways. First, CAFA\n    uses \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d the same way they are used in Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 20, which refers to \u201cpersons\u201d as individuals\n    who are proposing to join as \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in a single action. Second, it\n    is difficult to imagine how the \u201cclaims of 100 or more\u201d unnamed indi-\n    viduals could be \u201cproposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the\n    . . . claims\u201d of some completely different group of named plaintiffs\n    \u201cinvolve common questions of law or fact.\u201d\n        Construing \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to include both named and unnamed real\n    parties in interest would stretch the meaning of \u201cplaintiff\u201d beyond\n    recognition. A \u201cplaintiff\u201d is commonly understood to be a party who\n    brings a civil suit in a court of law, not anyone, named or unnamed,\n    whom a suit may benefit. Moreover, respondents\u2019 definition would\n    also have to apply to the mass action provision\u2019s subsequent refer-\n    ence to \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in the phrase \u201cjurisdiction shall exist only over\n    those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000],\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n    See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118. This would result in an\n    administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have in-\n    tended, see Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 575,\n    where district courts would have to identify hundreds (or in this case,\n    hundreds of thousands) of unnamed parties whose claims are for less\n    than $75,000 and then decide how to dispose of their claims. Pp. 5\u2013\n    10.\n        (b) Statutory context reinforces this Court\u2019s reading of the mass ac-\n    tion provision. CAFA provides that once removal occurs, a case shall\n    not be transferred to another court \u201cunless a majority of the plaintiffs\n    in the action request transfer.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(C)(i). If \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in-\n    cluded unnamed parties, it would be surpassingly difficult for a court\n    to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide\n    whether an action may be transferred. Moreover, respondents\u2019 posi-\n    tion that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a\n    class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions\n    largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\u2019s relaxed class action ju-\n    risdictional rules cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of\n    plaintiffs rather than using the class device. Had Congress wanted\n    CAFA to authorize removal of representative actions brought by\n    States as sole plaintiffs on respondents\u2019 theory, it would have done so\n    through the class action provision, not the mass action provision.\n    Pp. 10\u201311.\n        (c) This Court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to\n    require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to en-\n    sure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

AU OPTRONICS \n\n               CORPORATION ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n                               [January 14, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA or\nAct), defendants in civil suits may remove \u201cmass actions\u201d\nfrom state to federal court. CAFA defines a \u201cmass action\u201d\nas \u201cany civil action . . . in which monetary relief claims of\n100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the\nground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common ques-\ntions of law or fact.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). The\nquestion presented is whether a suit filed by a State as the\nsole plaintiff constitutes a \u201cmass action\u201d under CAFA\nwhere it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries\nsuffered by the State\u2019s citizens. We hold that it does not.\nAccording to CAFA\u2019s plain text, a \u201cmass action\u201d must\ninvolve monetary claims brought by 100 or more persons\nwho propose to try those claims jointly as named plain-\ntiffs. Because the State of Mississippi is the only named\nplaintiff in the instant action, the case must be remanded\nto state court.\n2     MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n   Congress enacted CAFA in order to \u201camend the proce-\ndures that apply to consideration of interstate class ac-\ntions.\u201d 119 Stat. 4. In doing so, Congress recognized that\n\u201c[c]lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part\nof the legal system.\u201d CAFA \u00a72. It was concerned, however,\nthat certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdic-\ntion, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332, had functioned to \u201ckee[p] cases of\nnational importance\u201d in state courts rather than federal\ncourts. CAFA \u00a72.\n   CAFA accordingly loosened the requirements for diver-\nsity jurisdiction for two types of cases\u2014\u201cclass actions\u201d and\n\u201cmass actions.\u201d The Act defines \u201cclass action\u201d to mean\n\u201cany civil action filed under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure or similar State statute or rule of judicial\nprocedure.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(1)(B). And it defines\n\u201cmass action\u201d to mean \u201cany civil action . . . in which mone-\ntary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed\nto be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019\nclaims involve common questions of law or fact.\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n   For class and mass actions, CAFA expanded diversity\njurisdiction in two key ways. First, it replaced the ordi-\nnary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship\namong all plaintiffs and defendants, see State Farm Fire\n& Casualty Co. v. Tashire, 386 U. S. 523, 530\u2013531 (1967),\nwith a requirement of minimal diversity. Under that re-\nquirement, a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a\nclass action if \u201cany member of a class of plaintiffs is\na citizen of a State different from any defendant.\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(2)(A). The same rule applies to mass actions.\nSee \u00a71332(d)(11)(A) (\u201c[A] mass action shall be deemed . . .\nremovable under [\u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2) through (d)(10)]\u201d). Second,\nwhereas \u00a71332(a) ordinarily requires each plaintiff\u2019s claim\nto exceed the sum or value of $75,000, see Exxon Mobil\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nCorp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U. S. 546, 554\u2013555\n(2005), CAFA grants federal jurisdiction over class and\nmass actions in which the aggregate amount in contro-\nversy exceeds $5 million. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(2), (d)(6), (d)(11)(A).\nClass and mass actions filed in state court that satisfy\nCAFA\u2019s requirements may be removed to federal court, 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71453, but federal jurisdiction in a mass action,\nunlike a class action, \u201cshall exist only over those plaintiffs\u201d\nwhose claims individually satisfy the $75,000 amount in\ncontroversy requirement, \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).1\n                              B\n   Respondents manufacture liquid crystal displays, or\nLCDs. In March 2011, the State of Mississippi sued them\nin state court, alleging that they had formed an interna-\ntional cartel to restrict competition and raise prices in\nthe LCD market. The State claimed that these actions vio-\nlated two Mississippi statutes: the Mississippi Antitrust Act,\nMiss. Code Ann. \u00a775\u201321\u20131 et seq. (2009), and the Missis-\nsippi Consumer Protection Act, \u00a775\u201324\u20131 et seq. (2009 and\nCum. Supp. 2013). The State sought injunctive relief and\ncivil penalties under both statutes, along with punitive\ndamages, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees. It also sought restitu-\ntion for its own purchases \u201cof LCD products and the pur-\nchases of its citizens.\u201d App. to Brief in Opposition 65a;\n\u00a775\u201324\u201311.\n   Respondents filed a notice to remove the case from state\nto federal court, arguing that the case was removable\nunder CAFA as either a \u201cclass action\u201d or a \u201cmass action.\u201d\nThe District Court ruled that the suit did not qualify as\na \u201cclass action\u201d because it was \u201cnot brought pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or a \u2018similar State\nstatute or rule of judicial procedure.\u2019 \u201d 876 F. Supp. 2d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 CAFA provides certain exceptions for class actions that involve mat-\n\nters of principally local or state concern. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a71332(d)(3)\u2013\n(5). None of them are at issue in this case.\n4        MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                             Opinion of the Court\n\n758, 769 (SD Miss. 2012). But it held that the suit did\nqualify as a \u201cmass action,\u201d because \u201c[i]t is a civil action \u2018in\nwhich monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are\nproposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions of law or fact.\u2019 \u201d Id.,\nat 771. The District Court reached that conclusion on the\nbasis of Fifth Circuit precedent in Louisiana ex rel. Cald-\nwell v. Allstate Ins. Co., 536 F. 3d 418 (CA5 2008), which it\nunderstood to \u201cstan[d] for the proposition that the words\n\u2018persons\u2019 and \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 in [the mass action definition] are\nto be defined as \u2018real parties in interest.\u2019 \u201d 876 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 771. Applying that rule, the court found that 100 or\nmore unidentified Mississippi consumers had purchased\nLCD screens and were therefore real parties in interest to\nthe State\u2019s restitution claim. Ibid. The court noted the\n\u201cpossibility that a \u2018mass action\u2019 should be thought of as a\n\u2018mass joinder,\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, as a suit involving 100 or more\n\u201cnamed plaintiffs.\u201d Ibid., n. 9. But it deemed that inter-\npretation to be foreclosed by Caldwell.\n   The District Court nonetheless remanded the case to\nstate court on the basis of CAFA\u2019s \u201cgeneral public excep-\ntion,\u201d which excludes from the \u201cmass action\u201d definition\n\u201cany civil action in which . . . all of the claims in the action\nare asserted on behalf of the general public (and not on\nbehalf of individual claimants or members of a purported\nclass) pursuant to a State statute specifically authorizing\nsuch action.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).\n   The Court of Appeals reversed. 701 F. 3d 796 (CA5\n2012). It agreed with the District Court\u2019s determination\nthat Mississippi\u2019s suit is not a \u201cclass action\u201d under CAFA.2\nId., at 799. It also agreed that, under Caldwell, the suit\nqualifies as a \u201cmass action\u201d because \u201c[t]he real parties in\ninterest in Mississippi\u2019s suit are those more than 100 . . .\nindividual citizens who purchased the [LCD] products\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 Respondents   do not challenge this ruling before this Court.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

It disagreed, how-\never, with the District Court\u2019s ruling that the suit falls\nwithin the general public exception. Id., at 802\u2013803.3\nJudge Elrod concurred in the judgment, noting that after\nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in Caldwell, three Courts of\nAppeals had deemed similar lawsuits not to be mass ac-\ntions removable under CAFA.4 We granted certiorari to\nresolve this split of authority, 569 U.

S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6). The statute\nprovides:\n     \u201c[T]he term mass action means any civil action (except\n     a [class action]) in which monetary relief claims of 100\n     or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on\n     the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common\n     questions of law or fact, except that jurisdiction shall\n     exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass\n     action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements\n     under subsection (a).\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n  The parties do not dispute that this provision encom-\npasses suits that are brought jointly by 100 or more\nnamed plaintiffs who propose to try their claims together.\nThe question is whether the provision also includes suits\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   3 The Court of Appeals did so on the rationale that because individual\n\nMississippi consumers are real parties in interest to the State\u2019s restitu-\ntion claim, the general public exception\u2019s requirement that \u201call of\nthe claims\u201d must be \u201casserted on behalf of the general public (and not\non behalf of individual claimants)\u201d was not satisfied. 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III).\n   4 See AU Optronics Corp. v. South Carolina, 699 F. 3d 385 (CA4\n\n2012); Nevada v. Bank of Am. Corp., 672 F. 3d 661 (CA9 2012); LG\nDisplay Co. v. Madigan, 665 F. 3d 768 (CA7 2011).\n6     MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbrought by fewer than 100 named plaintiffs on the theory\nthat there may be 100 or more unnamed persons who are\nreal parties in interest as beneficiaries to any of the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 claims. Respondents argue that the provision covers\nsuch suits because \u201cclaims of 100 or more persons\u201d refers\nto \u201cthe persons to whom the claim belongs, i.e., the real\nparties in interest to the claims,\u201d regardless of whether\nthose persons are named or unnamed. Brief for Respond-\nents 19 (emphasis in original). We disagree.\n   To start, the statute says \u201c100 or more persons,\u201d not\n\u201c100 or more named or unnamed real parties in interest.\u201d\nHad Congress intended the latter, it easily could have\ndrafted language to that effect. Indeed, when Congress\nwanted a numerosity requirement in CAFA to be satisfied\nby counting unnamed parties in interest in addition to\nnamed plaintiffs, it explicitly said so: CAFA provides that\nin order for a class action to be removable, \u201cthe number\nof members of all proposed plaintiff classes\u201d must be 100\nor greater, \u00a71332(d)(5)(B), and it defines \u201cclass members\u201d\nto mean \u201cthe persons (named or unnamed) who fall within\nthe definition of the proposed or certified class,\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(1)(D). Congress chose not to use the phrase\n\u201cnamed or unnamed\u201d in CAFA\u2019s mass action provision, a\ndecision we understand to be intentional. See Dean v.\nUnited States, 556 U. S. 568, 573 (2009) (\u201c \u2018[W]here Con-\ngress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\u2019 \u201d).\n   More fundamentally, respondents\u2019 interpretation cannot\nbe reconciled with the fact that the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d\nreferred to in the statute are not unspecified individuals\nwho have no actual participation in the suit, but instead\nthe very \u201cplaintiffs\u201d referred to later in the sentence\u2014the\nparties who are proposing to join their claims in a single\ntrial. Congress made this understanding evident in two\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nkey ways.\n   First, we presume that \u201c \u2018Congress is aware of existing\nlaw when it passes legislation.\u2019 \u201d Hall v. United States,\n566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 9). Here, Congress\nused the terms \u201cpersons\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs\u201d just as they are\nused in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, governing\nparty joinder. Where \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i) requires that the\n\u201cclaims of 100 or more persons [must be] proposed to be\ntried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in-\nvolve common questions of law or fact,\u201d Rule 20 provides\nthat \u201c[p]ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they\nassert any right to relief jointly . . . and any question of\nlaw or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the ac-\ntion.\u201d Thus, just as it is used in Rule 20, the term \u201cper-\nsons\u201d in \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i) refers to the individuals who\nare proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.\n   Second, respondents\u2019 interpretation of \u201cpersons\u201d cannot\nsquare with the statute\u2019s requirement that the claims of\nthe \u201c100 or more persons\u201d must be proposed for joint trial\n\u201con the ground that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common\nquestions of law or fact.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i). It is difficult\nto imagine how the claims of one set of unnamed individ-\nuals could be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the\nclaims of some completely different group of named plain-\ntiffs share common questions. The better understanding\nis that Congress meant for the \u201c100 or more persons\u201d and\nthe proposed \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to be one and the same.\n   Recognizing that the statute\u2019s use of the term \u201cpersons\u201d\ncould be a reference to proposed plaintiffs, respondents\nassert that \u201cplaintiffs,\u201d like \u201cpersons,\u201d should be construed\nto \u201cinclud[e] both named and unnamed real parties in in-\nterest.\u201d Brief for Respondents 24. But that stretches\nthe meaning of \u201cplaintiff\u201d beyond recognition. The term\n\u201cplaintiff\u201d is among the most commonly understood of\nlegal terms of art: It means a \u201cparty who brings a civil suit\nin a court of law.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed.\n8      MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary 1729 (1961) (defining \u201cplaintiff\u201d to mean \u201cone who\ncommences a personal action or lawsuit,\u201d or \u201cthe complain-\ning party in any litigation\u201d). It certainly does not mean\n\u201canyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit,\u201d as\nrespondents suggest.5\n   Moreover, Congress used the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d twice in\nthe mass action provision. The provision encompasses\nactions in which monetary \u201cclaims of 100 or more persons\nare proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the\nplaintiffs\u2019 claims involve common questions,\u201d and it then\nprovides that \u201cjurisdiction shall exist only over those\nplaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the juris-\ndictional amount requiremen[t]\u201d of $75,000.          \u00a71332(d)\n(11)(B)(i). If respondents are correct that \u201cplaintiffs\u201d\nmeans unnamed parties in interest where it is used the\nfirst time, then so too the second. After all, the \u201cpre-\nsumption that a given term is used to mean the same\nthing throughout a statute\u201d is \u201cat its most vigorous when a\nterm is repeated within a given sentence.\u201d Brown v.\nGardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994).\n   Yet if the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d is stretched to include all\nunnamed individuals with an interest in the suit, then\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(i)\u2019s requirement that \u201cjurisdiction shall\nexist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed\n$75,000]\u201d becomes an administrative nightmare that\nCongress could not possibly have intended, see Griffin v.\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 575 (1982). How\nis a district court to identify the unnamed parties whose\nclaims in a given case are for less than $75,000? Would\nthe court in this case, for instance, have to hold an eviden-\ntiary hearing to determine the identity of each of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Congress could of course require a real party in interest inquiry in a\n\nstatute that uses the term \u201cplaintiff\u201d simply by saying so. But it has\nnot done that here.\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

Supp. 2d, at 775. Even respondents do not\ndefend that outcome, presumably because it would mean\nthat much of the State\u2019s lawsuit could proceed in state\ncourt after all, simultaneously with the newly severed\nparallel federal action.6\n   We think it unlikely that Congress intended that federal\ndistrict courts engage in these unwieldy inquiries. By\ncontrast, interpreting \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in accordance with its\nusual meaning\u2014to refer to the actual named parties who\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 Respondents suggest that a district court might be able to exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the claims that fall beneath $75,000,\nthereby avoiding the problem of identifying and remanding such claims\nto the state court. We need not decide the issue here, but we note that\nat least one Court of Appeals has rejected that view. See Lowery v.\nAlabama Power Co., 483 F. 3d 1184, 1206, n. 51 (CA11 2007) (holding\nthat because supplemental jurisdiction does not apply where a federal\nstatute \u201c \u2018expressly provide[s] otherwise,\u2019 \u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a71367(a), the\nmass action provision\u2019s explicit exclusion of jurisdiction over claims\nbeneath $75,000 negates supplemental jurisdiction over such claims).\n10    MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbring an action\u2014leads to a straightforward, easy to ad-\nminister rule under which a court would examine whether\nthe plaintiffs have pleaded in good faith the requisite\namount. See Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367 U. S.\n348, 353 (1961). Our decision thus comports with the\ncommonsense observation that \u201cwhen judges must decide\njurisdictional matters, simplicity is a virtue.\u201d See Stand-\nard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip\nop., at 6).\n                               B\n   Our reading of the mass action provision\u2019s text is rein-\nforced by the statutory context. See Mohamad v. Palestin-\nian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 5\u20136).\n   First, the provision of CAFA governing transfer motions\nconfirms our view that the term \u201cplaintiffs\u201d refers to actual\nnamed parties as opposed to unnamed real parties in\ninterest. That provision, \u00a71332(d)(11)(C)(i), provides that\nonce a mass action has been removed to federal court, it\n\u201cshall not thereafter be transferred to any other court . . .\nunless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request\ntransfer.\u201d If respondents are correct that \u201cplaintiffs\u201d\nmeans \u201cunnamed parties in interest,\u201d it will be surpass-\ningly difficult for a court to decide in a case like this one\nwhether an action may be transferred. The District Court\nitself acknowledged this problem, noting that it would\nhave to identify and communicate with \u201chundreds of thou-\nsands if not millions of real parties in interest\u201d to \u201cpol[l]\n[them] about their preferred forum\u201d if respondents\u2019 inter-\npretation were correct. 876 F. Supp. 2d, at 777.\n   The context in which the mass action provision was\nenacted lends further support to our conclusion. Congress\u2019\noverriding concern in enacting CAFA was with class ac-\ntions. See Preamble, 119 Stat. 4 (describing CAFA as an\n\u201c[a]ct to amend the procedures that apply to consideration\nof interstate class actions\u201d); CAFA \u00a72 (Congress\u2019 findings\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwith respect to class actions). The mass action provision\nthus functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA\u2019s\nrelaxed jurisdictional rules for class actions cannot be\nevaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather\nthan using the class device. Respondents\u2019 argument fails\nto recognize this key distinction. Their position is ulti-\nmately that \u201c[t]his action is similar to a class action,\u201d such\nthat it should be removed. Brief for Respondents 27. But\nif Congress had wanted representative actions brought by\nStates as sole plaintiffs to be removable under CAFA on\nthe theory that they are in substance no different from\nclass actions, it would have done so through the class\naction provision, not the one governing mass actions.7\n                             III\n   Rather than relying on the text of CAFA as the source of\nits real party in interest inquiry, the Court of Appeals\nappeared to find such an inquiry necessary on the basis of\nwhat it understood to be a background principle: that\n\u201cfederal courts look to the substance of the action and not\nonly at the labels that the parties may attach.\u201d Caldwell,\n536 F. 3d, at 424. This was error.\n   We have interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to\nrequire courts in certain contexts to look behind the plead-\nings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or\ndestroying diversity jurisdiction. We have held, for exam-\nple, that a plaintiff may not keep a case out of federal\ncourt by fraudulently naming a nondiverse defendant.\nWecker v. National Enameling & Stamping Co., 204 U. S.\n176, 185\u2013186 (1907). Nor may a plaintiff create diversity\nby collusively assigning his interest in an action. Kramer\nv. Caribbean Mills, Inc., 394 U. S. 823, 825\u2013830 (1969);\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  parties both point to the \u201cgeneral public exception,\u201d\n\u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III), in support of their respective positions. But\nbecause the foregoing arguments resolve this case, we need not con-\nstrue that provision here.\n12    MISSISSIPPI EX REL. HOOD v. AU OPTRONICS CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nsee also 28 U. S. C. \u00a71359. And in cases involving a State\nor state official, we have inquired into the real party in\ninterest because a State\u2019s presence as a party will destroy\ncomplete diversity. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Missouri\nRailroad and Warehouse Comm\u2019rs, 183 U. S. 53, 58\u201359\n(1901).\n  But the question in this case is not simply whether\nthere exists some background principle of analyzing the\nreal parties in interest to a suit; the question is whether\nCongress intended that courts engage in that analysis\nwhen deciding whether a suit is a mass action. Recogniz-\ning this fact, respondents do not argue that the real party\nin interest inquiry employed in the above cases somehow\nsupersedes the text of CAFA; they instead argue that we\nshould read CAFA in light of those cases because \u201c \u2018Con-\ngress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with\nthis Court\u2019s precedents.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 19 (quot-\ning United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 495 (1997)). For\ntwo reasons, however, we conclude that Congress did not\nintend the background inquiry to apply to the mass action\nprovision.\n  First, it makes sense to infer Congress\u2019 intent to incor-\nporate a background principle into a new statute where\nthe principle has previously been applied in a similar\nmanner. But that is not the case here. The background\nreal party in interest inquiry identifies what party\u2019s (or\nparties\u2019) citizenship should be considered in determining\ndiversity. The inquiry that respondents urge is quite dif-\nferent: It is an attempt to count up additional unnamed\nparties in order to satisfy the mass action provision\u2019s\nnumerosity requirement. Respondents offer no reason to\nbelieve that Congress intended to extend the real party\ninquiry to this new circumstance, and so any presumption\nthat Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it\nexists in this case at all, would be comparatively weak. Cf.\nMeyer v. Holley, 537 U. S. 280, 286 (2003) (\u201cCongress\u2019\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                13\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsilence, while permitting an inference that Congress in-\ntended to apply ordinary background tort principles,\ncannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modifi-\ncation of those rules\u201d).8\n   Second, even if the background principle had previously\nbeen applied in the manner sought by respondents, Con-\ngress provided express indications that it did not want the\nprinciple to apply to the mass action provision. It speci-\nfied that \u201cthe term \u2018mass action\u2019 shall not include any civil\naction in which . . . the claims are joined upon motion of a\ndefendant.\u201d \u00a71332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II). By prohibiting de-\nfendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in\norder to turn it into a mass action, Congress demonstrated\nits focus on the persons who are actually proposing to join\ntogether as named plaintiffs in the suit. Requiring district\ncourts to pierce the pleadings to identify unnamed persons\ninterested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.\nMoreover, as already discussed, Congress repeatedly used\nthe word \u201cplaintiffs\u201d to describe the 100 or more persons\nwhose claims must be proposed for a joint trial. That word\nrefers to actual, named parties\u2014a concept inherently at\nodds with the background inquiry into unnamed real\nparties in interest, who by definition are never plaintiffs.\nCongress thus clearly displaced a background real party in\ninterest inquiry, even assuming one might otherwise\napply. Cf. Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U. S. 438,\n459, n. 16 (2002).\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 We have also applied a real party in interest inquiry in contexts\n\nother than that of determining citizenship for purposes of diversity\njurisdiction. See North Dakota v. Minnesota, 263 U. S. 365, 374\u2013376\n(1923) (state sovereign immunity); Oklahoma ex rel. Johnson v. Cook,\n304 U. S. 387, 392\u2013393 (1938) (original jurisdiction). But even if we\nwere to indulge in a presumption that Congress somehow intended to\nimport the inquiry applied in those particular contexts into the mass\naction provision\u2019s distinct numerosity requirement, we would find any\nsuch presumption overridden by CAFA\u2019s text.\n14    MISSISSIPPI EX REL.
