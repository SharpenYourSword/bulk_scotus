BAUMAN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11–965.      Argued October 15, 2013—Decided January 14, 2014\nPlaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who\n  filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant\n  DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public\n  stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.\n  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argenti-\n  na), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state se-\n  curity forces during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War” to kidnap,\n  detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them,\n  plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those alle-\n  gations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and\n  the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California\n  and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicat-\n  ed on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\n  another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its\n  principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daim-\n  ler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the\n  United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the\n  action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plain-\n  tiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the\n  California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler’s\n  motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the\n  Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the\n  California courts’ all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler’s “agent” for\n  jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be an-\n  swerable to suit in that State.\nHeld: Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries alleged-\n ly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside\n the United States. Pp. 6–24.\n2                       DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) California’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal ju-\n    risdiction to the full extent permissible under the U. S. Constitution.\n    Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit’s holding com-\n    ports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule\n    Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 6.\n       (b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over\n    persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the fo-\n    rum. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. That rigidly territorial focus\n    eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by\n    the Court’s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Wash-\n    ington, 326 U. S. 310. International Shoe presaged the recognition of\n    two personal jurisdiction categories: One category, today called “spe-\n    cific jurisdiction,” see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.\n    Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit\n    “arise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the fo-\n    rum,” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n    408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific,\n    case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as “general ju-\n    risdiction,” exercisable when a foreign corporation’s “continuous cor-\n    porate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a na-\n    ture as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from\n    dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n       Since International Shoe, “specific jurisdiction has become the cen-\n    terpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n    This Court’s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.\n    See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, Helicopte-\n    ros, 466 U. S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. As is evident\n    from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdic-\n    tion has been cut loose from Pennoyer’s sway, general jurisdiction has\n    not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 6–14.\n       (c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qual-\n    ifies as at home in California, Daimler’s affiliations with California\n    are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that\n    State’s courts. Pp. 14–23.\n          (1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of\n    general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals’ analysis in this case can-\n    not be sustained. The Ninth Circuit’s agency determination rested\n    primarily on its observation that MBUSA’s services were “important”\n    to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to perform\n    those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if “importan[ce]” in\n    this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign\n    corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever\n    they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would\n    sweep beyond even the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” re-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  jected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___. Pp. 15–17.\n       (2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and\n  that MBUSA’s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be\n  no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The\n  paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corpora-\n  tion’s place of incorporation and principal place of business. Good-\n  year, 564 U. S., at ___. Plaintiffs’ reasoning, however, would reach\n  well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general\n  jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation “engages in a sub-\n  stantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.” Brief for\n  Respondents 16–17, and nn. 7–8. The words “continuous and sys-\n  tematic,” plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in\n  International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of spe-\n  cific jurisdiction would be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317. With\n  respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead\n  of “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n  state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit . . . on\n  causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those ac-\n  tivities.” Id., at 318. Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has\n  explained, is whether a foreign corporation’s “affiliations with the\n  State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to render [it] essentially\n  at home in the forum State.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n     Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor\n  does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daim-\n  ler’s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argen-\n  tina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presuma-\n  bly be available in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\n  sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general juris-\n  diction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to\n  conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to it,\n  was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims\n  by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred\n  or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 18–21.\n       (3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears atten-\n  tion. This Court’s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs’\n  Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See Ki-\n  obel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___, and Mohamad\n  v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___. The Ninth Circuit, more-\n  over, paid little heed to the risks to international comity posed by its\n  expansive view of general jurisdiction.

The litigation com-\nmenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents1\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California against DaimlerChrysler\nAktiengesellschaft (Daimler),2 a German public stock\ncompany, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures\nMercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.           The complaint\nalleged that during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War,”\nDaimler’s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argen-\ntina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security\nforces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB\n——————\n   1 One plaintiff is a resident of Argentina and a citizen of Chile; all\n\nother plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Argentina.\n   2 Daimler was restructured in 2007 and is now known as Daimler AG.\n\nNo party contends that any postsuit corporate reorganization bears on\nour disposition of this case. This opinion refers to members of the\nDaimler corporate family by the names current at the time plaintiffs\nfiled suit.\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArgentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons\nclosely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged\nhuman-rights violations were sought from Daimler under\nthe laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.\nJurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the Cali-\nfornia contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\na subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with\nits principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA\ndistributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independ-\nent dealerships throughout the United States, including\nCalifornia.\n   The question presented is whether the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the Dis-\ntrict Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case, given the absence of any California connection\nto the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court’s general or all-\npurpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place\nwhere Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against\nit, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For exam-\nple, as plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed, under the proffered\njurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle\noverturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passen-\nger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit\nin California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. Exercises of\npersonal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by\ndue process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory\nauthority.\n   In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between\ngeneral or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-\nlinked jurisdiction. As to the former, we held that a court\nmay assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation “to hear\nany and all claims against [it]” only when the corporation’s\naffiliations with the State in which suit is brought are\nso constant and pervasive “as to render [it] essentially at\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In-\nstructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not “at\nhome” in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries\nplaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina’s conduct in Argentina.\n                              I\n  In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with\nArgentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, tor-\nture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the\nmilitary dictatorship in place there from 1976 through\n1983, a period known as Argentina’s “Dirty War.” Based\non those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the\nAlien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, and the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following\n28 U. S. C. §1350, as well as claims for wrongful death and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws\nof California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in\nthe complaint center on MB Argentina’s plant in Gonzalez\nCatan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina’s alleged col-\nlaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in Cali-\nfornia or anywhere else in the United States.\n  Plaintiffs’ operative complaint names only one corporate\ndefendant: Daimler, the petitioner here. Plaintiffs seek to\nhold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina’s alleged\nmalfeasance. Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft\n(public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz\nvehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in\nStuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina\nwas a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler’s predecessor\nin interest.\n  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal\njurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted\ndeclarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the\npresence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively,\n4                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could\nbe founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a dis-\ntinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should\nbe treated as Daimler’s agent for jurisdictional purposes.\n  MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Dela-\nware limited liability corporation.3 MBUSA serves as\nDaimler’s exclusive importer and distributor in the United\nStates, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from\nDaimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and\nultimately distributing them to independent dealerships\nlocated throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA’s prin-\ncipal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has\nmultiple California-based facilities, including a regional\noffice in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in\nCarson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the\nrecord developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of\nluxury vehicles to the California market. In particular,\nover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States\ntake place in California, and MBUSA’s California sales\naccount for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales.\n  The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delin-\neated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets\nforth requirements for MBUSA’s distribution of Mercedes-\nBenz vehicles in the United States. That agreement\nestablished MBUSA as an “independent contracto[r]”\nthat “buy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] . . . as an independent\nbusiness for [its] own account.” App. 179a. The agree-\nment “does not make [MBUSA] . . . a general or special\nagent, partner, joint venturer or employee of\nDAIMLERCHRYSLER or any DaimlerChrysler Group\nCompany”; MBUSA “ha[s] no authority to make binding\nobligations for or act on behalf of DAIMLERCHRYSLER\nor any DaimlerChrysler Group Company.” Ibid.\n——————\n 3 At times relevant to this suit, MBUSA was wholly owned by Daimler-\n\nChrysler North America Holding Corporation, a Daimler subsidiary.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After allowing jurisdictional discovery on plaintiffs’\nagency allegations, the District Court granted Daimler’s\nmotion to dismiss. Daimler’s own affiliations with Cali-\nfornia, the court first determined, were insufficient to\nsupport the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the\ncorporation. Bauman v.

Addressing solely the question of agency, the\nCourt of Appeals held that plaintiffs had not shown the\nexistence of an agency relationship of the kind that might\nwarrant attribution of MBUSA’s contacts to Daimler.\nBauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 579 F. 3d 1088, 1096–\n1097 (2009). Judge Reinhardt dissented. In his view, the\nagency test was satisfied and considerations of “reason-\nableness” did not bar the exercise of jurisdiction. Id., at\n1098–1106. Granting plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing, the\npanel withdrew its initial opinion and replaced it with one\nauthored by Judge Reinhardt, which elaborated on reason-\ning he initially expressed in dissent. Bauman v. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909 (CA9 2011).\n  Daimler petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nurging that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over\nDaimler could not be reconciled with this Court’s decision\nin Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011). Over the dissent of eight judges, the\nNinth Circuit denied Daimler’s petition. See Bauman v.\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 676 F. 3d 774 (2011) (O’Scannlain,\n6                  DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nDaimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims\ninvolving only foreign plaintiffs and conduct occurring\nentirely abroad. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determin-\ning the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to\nestablish personal jurisdiction over a defendant “who is\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction\nin the state where the district court is located”). Under\nCalifornia’s long-arm statute, California state courts may\nexercise personal jurisdiction “on any basis not incon-\nsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United\nStates.” Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §410.10 (West 2004).\nCalifornia’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the\nU. S. Constitution. We therefore inquire whether the\nNinth Circuit’s holding comports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 464 (1985).\n                               III\n   In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878), decided shortly\nafter the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\nCourt held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over persons\nreaches no farther than the geographic bounds of the\nforum. See id., at 720 (“The authority of every tribunal is\nnecessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State\nin which it is established.”). See also Shaffer v. Heitner,\n433 U. S. 186, 197 (1977) (Under Pennoyer, “any attempt\n‘directly’ to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons\nor property would offend sister States and exceed the\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

In time, however,\nthat strict territorial approach yielded to a less rigid un-\nderstanding, spurred by “changes in the technology of\ntransportation and communication, and the tremendous\ngrowth of interstate business activity.” Burnham v. Supe-\nrior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 617\n(1990) (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\n   “The canonical opinion in this area remains Interna-\ntional Shoe [Co. v. Washington], 326 U. S. 310 [(1945)], in\nwhich we held that a State may authorize its courts to\nexercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defend-\nant if the defendant has ‘certain minimum contacts with\n[the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not\noffend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.” ’ ” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quot-\ning International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316). Following\nInternational Shoe, “the relationship among the defend-\nant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually\nexclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of\nPennoyer rest, became the central concern of the inquiry\ninto personal jurisdiction.” Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204.\n   International Shoe’s conception of “fair play and sub-\nstantial justice” presaged the development of two catego-\nries of personal jurisdiction. The first category is repre-\nsented by International Shoe itself, a case in which the in-\nstate activities of the corporate defendant “ha[d] not only\nbeen continuous and systematic, but also g[a]ve rise to the\nliabilities sued on.” 326 U.

The\ndefendant in Perkins, Benguet, was a company incorpo-\nrated under the laws of the Philippines, where it operated\ngold and silver mines.

See post, at 11–12, n. 8 (opinion concurring in\njudgment) (“By the time the suit [in Perkins] was commenced, the\ncompany had resumed its considerable operations in the Philippines,”\n“rebuilding its properties there” and “purchasing machinery, supplies\nand equipment.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). See also post, at\n7–8, n. 5 (many of the corporation’s “key management decisions” were\nmade by the out-of-state purchasing agent and chief of staff ). JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR’s account overlooks this Court’s opinion in Perkins and the\npoint on which that opinion turned: All of Benguet’s activities were\ndirected by the company’s president from within Ohio. See Perkins v.\nBenguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, 447–448 (1952) (company’s\nPhilippine mining operations “were completely halted during the\noccupation . . . by the Japanese”; and the company’s president, from his\nOhio office, “supervised policies dealing with the rehabilitation of the\ncorporation’s properties in the Philippines and . . . dispatched funds to\ncover purchases of machinery for such rehabilitation”). On another\nday, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joined a unanimous Court in recognizing: “To\nthe extent that the company was conducting any business during and\nimmediately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was\ndoing so in Ohio . . . .” Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.

S. citizens\nperished in that accident; their survivors and representa-\ntives brought suit in Texas state court against the helicop-\nter’s owner and operator, a Colombian corporation. That\ncompany’s contacts with Texas were confined to “sending\nits chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-\nnegotiation session; accepting into its New York bank\naccount checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing\nhelicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\nTexas-based helicopter company] for substantial sums;\nand sending personnel to [Texas] for training.” Id., at 416.\nNotably, those contacts bore no apparent relationship to\nthe accident that gave rise to the suit. We held that the\ncompany’s Texas connections did not resemble the “con-\ntinuous and systematic general business contacts . . .\nfound to exist in Perkins.” Ibid. “[M]ere purchases, even\nif occurring at regular intervals,” we clarified, “are not\nenough to warrant a State’s assertion of in personam\njurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of\naction not related to those purchase transactions.” Id., at\n418.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear, we answered the question:\n“Are foreign subsidiaries of a United States parent corpo-\nration amenable to suit in state court on claims unrelated\nto any activity of the subsidiaries in the forum State?” 564\nU.

Those\nforeign subsidiaries, which manufactured tires for sale in\nEurope and Asia, lacked any affiliation with North Caro-\nlina. A small percentage of tires manufactured by the\nforeign subsidiaries were distributed in North Carolina,\nhowever, and on that ground, the North Carolina Court of\nAppeals held the subsidiaries amenable to the general\njurisdiction of North Carolina courts.\n   We reversed, observing that the North Carolina court’s\nanalysis “elided the essential difference between case-\nspecific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10).

As International Shoe itself\nteaches, a corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts\nwithin a state is not enough to support the demand that\nthe corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that\nactivity.” 326 U.

Chi. Legal\nForum 119, 139 (“[G]eneral jurisdiction exists as an imperfect safety\nvalve that sometimes allows plaintiffs access to a reasonable forum in\ncases when specific jurisdiction would deny it.”).\n   10 Remarkably, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR treats specific jurisdiction as\n\nthough it were barely there. Given the many decades in which specific\njurisdiction has flourished, it would be hard to conjure up an example of\nthe “deep injustice” JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR predicts as a consequence of\nour holding that California is not an all-purpose forum for suits against\nDaimler. Post, at 16. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR identifies “the concept of\nreciprocal fairness” as the “touchstone principle of due process in this\nfield.” Post, at 10 (citing International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319). She over-\nlooks, however, that in the very passage of International Shoe on which\nshe relies, the Court left no doubt that it was addressing specific—\nnot general—jurisdiction. See id., at 319 (“The exercise of th[e]\nprivilege [of conducting corporate activities within a State] may give\nrise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are\nconnected with the activities within the state, a procedure which re-\nquires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can,\nin most instances, hardly be said to be undue.” (emphasis added)).\n   11 As the Court made plain in Goodyear and repeats here, general\n\njurisdiction requires affiliations “so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to\nrender [the foreign corporation] essentially at home in the forum State.”\n564 U.

In the proceedings\nbelow, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain\npoints we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never at-\ntempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction cate-\ngory. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District\nCourt’s holding that Daimler’s own contacts with Califor-\nnia were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exer-\ncise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately\npersuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA’s Califor-\nnia contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point\nhave they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of\nDaimler.\n   Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to\nplaintiffs’ assertion that the California courts could exer-\ncise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.12 But see Brief\nfor Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of Good-\nyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction\nin California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16, n. 5 (hereinafter U. S. Brief) (same). We will assume\nthen, for purposes of this decision only, that MBUSA\nqualifies as at home in California.\n                             A\n  In sustaining the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nDaimler, the Ninth Circuit relied on an agency theory,\ndetermining that MBUSA acted as Daimler’s agent for\njurisdictional purposes and then attributing MBUSA’s\nCalifornia contacts to Daimler. The Ninth Circuit’s agency\nanalysis derived from Circuit precedent considering\nprincipally whether the subsidiary “performs services that\nare sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if\nit did not have a representative to perform them, the\n——————\n 12 MBUSA   is not a defendant in this case.\n16                     DAIMLER AG v.

Unocal Corp., 248 F. 3d 915, 928 (CA9 2001); em-\nphasis deleted).\n   This Court has not yet addressed whether a foreign\ncorporation may be subjected to a court’s general jurisdic-\ntion based on the contacts of its in-state subsidiary. Daim-\nler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a\nsubsidiary’s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its\nparent only when the former is so dominated by the latter\nas to be its alter ego. The Ninth Circuit adopted a less\nrigorous test based on what it described as an “agency”\nrelationship. Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and\nshapes: “One may be an agent for some business purposes\nand not others so that the fact that one may be an agent\nfor one purpose does not make him or her an agent for\nevery purpose.” 2A C. J. S., Agency §43, p. 367 (2013)\n(footnote omitted).13 A subsidiary, for example, might be\n——————\n  13 Agency   relationships, we have recognized, may be relevant to the\nexistence of specific jurisdiction. “[T]he corporate personality,” Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), observed, “is a\nfiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a\nfact.” Id., at 316. See generally 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of\nCorporations §30, p. 30 (Supp. 2012–2013) (“A corporation is a distinct\nlegal entity that can act only through its agents.”). As such, a corpora-\ntion can purposefully avail itself of a forum by directing its agents or\ndistributors to take action there. See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U. S., at 112\n(opinion of O’Connor, J.) (defendant’s act of “marketing [a] product\nthrough a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the\nforum State” may amount to purposeful availment); International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (“the commission of some single or occasional acts of\nthe corporate agent in a state” may sometimes “be deemed sufficient to\nrender the corporation liable to suit” on related claims). See also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24 (acknowledging that “an agency relationship may be\nsufficient in some circumstances to give rise to specific jurisdiction”). It\ndoes not inevitably follow, however, that similar reasoning applies to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Cf. Goodyear, 564 U.

The Court of Appeals did not advert to\nthat prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invoca-\ntion of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdic-\ntion, for in no event can the appeals court’s analysis be\nsustained.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s agency finding rested primarily on\nits observation that MBUSA’s services were “important” to\nDaimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to\nperform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.\nFormulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks\nthe deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer:\n“Anything a corporation does through an independent\ncontractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably some-\nthing that the corporation would do ‘by other means’ if the\nindependent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not\nexist.” 676 F. 3d, at 777 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).14 The Ninth Circuit’s agency\ntheory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to\ngeneral jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state sub-\nsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond\neven the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” we re-\njected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).15\n——————\n  14 Indeed, plaintiffs do not defend this aspect of the Ninth Circuit’s\n\nanalysis. See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 18 (“We do not believe that\nthis gloss is particularly helpful.”).\n  15 The Ninth Circuit’s agency analysis also looked to whether the\n\nparent enjoys “the right to substantially control” the subsidiary’s\nactivities. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909, 924\n(2011). The Court of Appeals found the requisite “control” demon-\nstrated by the General Distributor Agreement between Daimler and\nMBUSA, which gives Daimler the right to oversee certain of MBUSA’s\noperations, even though that agreement expressly disavowed the\ncreation of any agency relationship. Thus grounded, the separate\ninquiry into control hardly curtails the overbreadth of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s agency holding.\n18                     DAIMLER AG v.

Post, at 5–6. That assertion is doubly flawed.\nFirst, the question on which we granted certiorari, as stated in Daim-\nler’s petition, is “whether it violates due process for a court to exercise\ngeneral personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based solely on\nthe fact that an indirect corporate subsidiary performs services on\nbehalf of the defendant in the forum State.” Pet. for Cert. i. That\nquestion fairly encompasses an inquiry into whether, in light of Good-\nyear, Daimler can be considered at home in California based on\nMBUSA’s in-state activities. See also this Court’s Rule 14.1(a) (a\nparty’s statement of the question presented “is deemed to comprise\nevery subsidiary question fairly included therein”). Moreover, both in\nthe Ninth Circuit, see, e.g., Brief for Federation of German Industries\net al. as Amici Curiae in No. 07–15386 (CA9), p. 3, and in this Court,\nsee, e.g., U. S.

Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559\nU. S. 77, 94 (2010) (“Simple jurisdictional rules . . . pro-\nmote greater predictability.”). These bases afford plain-\ntiffs recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in\nwhich a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all\nclaims.\n   Goodyear did not hold that a corporation may be subject\nto general jurisdiction only in a forum where it is incor-\nporated or has its principal place of business; it simply\ntyped those places paradigm all-purpose forums. Plaintiffs\nwould have us look beyond the exemplar bases Goodyear\nidentified, and approve the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin every State in which a corporation “engages in a sub-\nstantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.”\nBrief for Respondents 16–17, and nn. 7–8. That formula-\ntion, we hold, is unacceptably grasping.\n   As noted, see supra, at 7–8, the words “continuous and\nsystematic” were used in International Shoe to describe\ninstances in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction\nwould be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317 (jurisdiction\ncan be asserted where a corporation’s in-state activities\nare not only “continuous and systematic, but also give rise\nto the liabilities sued on”).17 Turning to all-purpose juris-\ndiction, in contrast, International Shoe speaks of “instances\nin which the continuous corporate operations within a\nstate [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify\n——————\n    17 International Shoe also recognized, as noted above, see supra, at 7–8,\n\nthat “some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state\n. . . , because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their\ncommission, may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable\nto suit.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n20                     DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nsuit . . . on causes of action arising from dealings en-\ntirely distinct from those activities.” Id., at 318 (emphasis\nadded). See also Twitchell, Why We Keep Doing Business\nWith Doing-Business Jurisdiction, 2001 U. Chi. Legal\nForum 171, 184 (International Shoe “is clearly not saying\nthat dispute-blind jurisdiction exists whenever ‘continuous\nand systematic’ contacts are found.”).18 Accordingly, the\ninquiry under Goodyear is not whether a foreign corpora-\ntion’s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense\n“continuous and systematic,” it is whether that corpora-\ntion’s “affiliations with the State are so ‘continuous and\nsystematic’ as to render [it] essentially at home in the\nforum State.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).19\n   Here, neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in\n——————\n  18 Plaintiffs emphasize two decisions, Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, 170\nU. S. 100 (1898), and Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259,\n115 N. E. 915 (1917) (Cardozo, J.), both cited in Perkins v. Benguet\nConsol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), just after the statement that\na corporation’s continuous operations in-state may suffice to establish\ngeneral jurisdiction. Id., at 446, and n. 6. See also International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (citing Tauza). Barrow and Tauza indeed upheld the\nexercise of general jurisdiction based on the presence of a local office,\nwhich signaled that the corporation was “doing business” in the forum.\nPerkins’ unadorned citations to these cases, both decided in the era\ndominated by Pennoyer’s territorial thinking, see supra, at 6–7, should\nnot attract heavy reliance today. See generally Feder, Goodyear,\n“Home,” and the Uncertain Future of Doing Business Jurisdiction, 63\nS. C. L. Rev. 671 (2012) (questioning whether “doing business” should\npersist as a basis for general jurisdiction).\n   19 We do not foreclose the possibility that in an exceptional case, see,\n\ne.g., Perkins, described supra, at 10–12, and n. 8, a corporation’s opera-\ntions in a forum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal\nplace of business may be so substantial and of such a nature as to\nrender the corporation at home in that State. But this case presents no\noccasion to explore that question, because Daimler’s activities in\nCalifornia plainly do not approach that level. It is one thing to hold a\ncorporation answerable for operations in the forum State, see infra, at\n23, quite another to expose it to suit on claims having no connection\nwhatever to the forum State.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

If Daimler’s California activities suf-\nficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in\nCalifornia, the same global reach would presumably be\navailable in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\nsizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdic-\ntion would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants “to\nstructure their primary conduct with some minimum\nassurance as to where that conduct will and will not ren-\nder them liable to suit.” Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at\n472 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude\nthat Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to\nit, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit\nthere on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do\nwith anything that occurred or had its principal impact in\nCalifornia.20\n——————\n   20 To clarify in light of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion concurring in the\n\njudgment, the general jurisdiction inquiry does not “focu[s] solely on the\nmagnitude of the defendant’s in-state contacts.” Post, at 8. General\njurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation’s activities in\ntheir entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A corporation that operates\nin many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Other-\nwise, “at home” would be synonymous with “doing business” tests\nframed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States. See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1142–1144. Nothing in International Shoe\nand its progeny suggests that “a particular quantum of local activity”\nshould give a State authority over a “far larger quantum of . . . activity”\nhaving no connection to any in-state activity. Feder, supra, at 694.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reach the same result, but for a different\nreason. Rather than concluding that Daimler is not at home in Cali-\nfornia, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would hold that the exercise of general\njurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable “in the unique circum-\nstances of this case.” Post, at 1. In other words, she favors a resolution\nfit for this day and case only. True, a multipronged reasonableness\ncheck was articulated in Asahi, 480 U. S., at 113–114, but not as a free-\nfloating test. Instead, the check was to be essayed when specific\njurisdiction is at issue. See also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\nU. S. 462, 476–478 (1985). First, a court is to determine whether the\n22                     DAIMLER AG v.

The Court of Appeals emphasized, as support-\nive of the exercise of general jurisdiction, plaintiffs’ asser-\ntion of claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28\nU. S. C. §1350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of\n1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C.\n§1350. See 644 F. 3d, at 927 (“American federal courts, be\nthey in California or any other state, have a strong inter-\nest in adjudicating and redressing international human\nrights abuses.”). Recent decisions of this Court, however,\nhave rendered plaintiffs’ ATS and TVPA claims infirm.\nSee Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (presumption against extra-\nterritorial application controls claims under the ATS);\nMohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n——————\nconnection between the forum and the episode-in-suit could justify the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction. Then, in a second step, the court is to\nconsider several additional factors to assess the reasonableness of\nentertaining the case. When a corporation is genuinely at home in the\nforum State, however, any second-step inquiry would be superfluous.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR fears that our holding will “lead to greater un-\npredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional dis-\ncovery.” Post, at 14. But it is hard to see why much in the way of\ndiscovery would be needed to determine where a corporation is at home.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s proposal to import Asahi’s “reasonableness” check\ninto the general jurisdiction determination, on the other hand, would\nindeed compound the jurisdictional inquiry. The reasonableness factors\nidentified in Asahi include “the burden on the defendant,” “the interests\nof the forum State,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining relief,” “the\ninterstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient\nresolution of controversies,” “the shared interest of the several States in\nfurthering fundamental substantive social policies,” and, in the inter-\nnational context, “the procedural and substantive policies of other\nnations whose interests are affected by the assertion of jurisdiction.”\n480 U. S., at 113–115 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Impos-\ning such a checklist in cases of general jurisdiction would hardly\npromote the efficient disposition of an issue that should be resolved\nexpeditiously at the outset of litigation.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

Other nations do not share the uninhibited\napproach to personal jurisdiction advanced by the Court of\nAppeals in this case. In the European Union, for example,\na corporation may generally be sued in the nation in which\nit is “domiciled,” a term defined to refer only to the loca-\ntion of the corporation’s “statutory seat,” “central admin-\nistration,” or “principal place of business.” European\nParliament and Council Reg. 1215/2012, Arts. 4(1), and\n63(1), 2012 O. J. (L. 351) 7, 18. See also id., Art. 7(5), 2012\nO. J. 7 (as to “a dispute arising out of the operations of a\nbranch, agency or other establishment,” a corporation may\nbe sued “in the courts for the place where the branch,\nagency or other establishment is situated” (emphasis\nadded)). The Solicitor General informs us, in this regard,\nthat “foreign governments’ objections to some domestic\ncourts’ expansive views of general jurisdiction have in the\npast impeded negotiations of international agreements on\nthe reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments.”\nU.

It has multiple facilities\nin the State, including a regional headquarters. Each\nyear, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars,\nthe sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year\nthis suit was brought. And it provides service and sales\nsupport to customers throughout the State. Daimler has\nconceded that California courts may exercise general\njurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts,\nand the Court assumes that MBUSA’s contacts may be\nattributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether\nDaimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.\n  Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that\nthey are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process\njurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that\nDaimler’s contacts with California are too few, but that its\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncontacts with other forums are too many. In other words,\nthe Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple\noffices, the direct distribution of thousands of products\naccounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous\ninteraction with customers throughout a State would be\nenough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nsome businesses. Daimler is just not one of those busi­\nnesses, the Court concludes, because its California con­\ntacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive “na­\ntionwide and worldwide” operations. Ante, at 21, n. 20. In\nrecent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the\nconcept of multinational corporations that are supposedly\n“too big to fail”; today the Court deems Daimler “too big for\ngeneral jurisdiction.”\n   The Court’s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both\nprocess and substance. As to process, the Court decides\nthis case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed\non below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a\nfootnote to its brief. Brief for Petitioner 31–32, n. 5. As\nto substance, the Court’s focus on Daimler’s operations out­\nside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal\njurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defend­\nant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently\ntaken advantage of the State’s laws and protections\nthrough its contacts in the State; whether the defendant\nhas contacts elsewhere is immaterial.\n   Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can\nand should decide this case on the far simpler ground that,\nno matter how extensive Daimler’s contacts with Califor­\nnia, that State’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unrea­\nsonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs\nsuing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and\ngiven that a more appropriate forum is available. Because\nI would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I\nconcur in the judgment only.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

The contacts prong asks whether the defendant\nhas sufficient contacts with the forum State to support\npersonal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks\nwhether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable\nunder the circumstances. Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475–478 (1985). As the majority\npoints out, all of the cases in which we have applied the\nreasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Ante, at 21, n. 20. Whether the\nreasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdic­\ntion context is therefore a question we have never decided,1\nand it is one on which I can appreciate the arguments on\nboth sides. But it would be imprudent to decide that\nquestion in this case given that respondents have failed to\nargue against the application of the reasonableness prong\nduring the entire 8-year history of this litigation. See\nBrief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application\n\n——————\n   1 The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that the reasonableness\n\nprong does in fact apply in the general jurisdiction context. See Metro-\npolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F. 3d 560, 573 (CA2\n1996) (“[E]very circuit that has considered the question has held,\nimplicitly or explicitly, that the reasonableness inquiry is applicable to\nall questions of personal jurisdiction, general or specific”); see also, e.g.,\nLakin v.

Without the\nbenefit of a single page of briefing on the issue, the majority casually\nadds each of these cases to the mounting list of decisions jettisoned as a\nconsequence of today’s ruling. See ante, at 21, n. 20.\n4                     DAIMLER AG v.

Superior Court of Cal., Solano\nCty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987): “the burden on the defendant,\nthe interests of the forum State,” “the plaintiff ’s interest\nin obtaining relief ” in the forum State, and the interests of\nother sovereigns in resolving the dispute. Id., at 113–114.\nWe held in Asahi that it would be “unreasonable and\nunfair” for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a\nclaim between a Taiwanese plaintiff and a Japanese de­\nfendant that arose out of a transaction in Taiwan, particu­\nlarly where the Taiwanese plaintiff had not shown that it\nwould be more convenient to litigate in California than in\nTaiwan or Japan. Id., at 114.\n  The same considerations resolve this case. It involves\nArgentine plaintiffs suing a German defendant for conduct\nthat took place in Argentina. Like the plaintiffs in Asahi,\nrespondents have failed to show that it would be more\nconvenient to litigate in California than in Germany, a\n——————\n    2 While\n          our decisions rejecting the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nhave typically done so under the minimum-contacts prong, we have\nnever required that prong to be decided first. See Asahi Metal Industry\nCo. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102, 121 (1987)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting\npersonal jurisdiction under the reasonableness prong and declining to\nconsider the minimum-contacts prong because doing so would not be\n“necessary”). And although the majority frets that deciding this case on\nthe reasonableness ground would be “a resolution fit for this day and\ncase only,” ante, at 21, n. 20, I do not understand our constitutional\nduty to require otherwise.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Asahi thus makes clear that it would be unrea­\nsonable for a court in California to subject Daimler to its\njurisdiction.\n                              II\n  The majority evidently agrees that, if the reasonable­\nness prong were to apply, it would be unreasonable for\nCalifornia courts to exercise jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case. See ante, at 20–21 (noting that it would be “exor­\nbitant” for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction\nover Daimler, a German defendant, in this “Argentina­\nrooted case” brought by “foreign plaintiffs”). But instead\nof resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the\nmajority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued\nnor decided below.3\n  We generally do not pass on arguments that lower\ncourts have not addressed. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). After all, “we are a court of\nreview, not of first view.” Ibid. This principle carries even\ngreater force where the argument at issue was never\npressed below. See Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198,\n205 (2001). Yet the majority disregards this principle,\nbasing its decision on an argument raised for the first time\n——————\n  3 The majority appears to suggest that Daimler may have presented\n\nthe argument in its petition for rehearing en banc before the Ninth\nCircuit. See ante, at 5 (stating that Daimler “urg[ed] that the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction . . . could not be reconciled with this Court’s\ndecision in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011)”). But Daimler’s petition for rehearing did not argue\nwhat the Court holds today. The Court holds that Daimler’s Califor-\nnia contacts would be insufficient for general jurisdiction even assum­\ning that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to Daimler. Daimler’s\nrehearing petition made a distinct argument—that attribution of\nMBUSA’s contacts should not be permitted under an “ ‘agency’ theory”\nbecause doing so would “rais[e] significant constitutional concerns”\nunder Goodyear. Petition for Rehearing or Rehearing En Banc in No.\n07–15386 (CA9), p. 9.\n6                  DAIMLER AG v.

We granted\ncertiorari on the question “whether it violates due process\nfor a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a\nforeign corporation based solely on the fact that an indi­\nrect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of\nthe defendant in the forum State.” Pet. for Cert. i. At no\npoint in Daimler’s petition for certiorari did the company\ncontend that, even if this attribution question were de­\ncided against it, its contacts in California would still be in-\nsufficient to support general jurisdiction. The parties’ merits\nbriefs accordingly focused on the attribution-of-contacts\nquestion, addressing the reasonableness inquiry (which\nhad been litigated and decided below) in most of the space\nthat remained. See Brief for Petitioner 17–37, 37–43;\nBrief for Respondents 18–47, 47–59.\n  In bypassing the question on which we granted certio­\nrari to decide an issue not litigated below, the Court leaves\nrespondents “without an unclouded opportunity to air\nthe issue the Court today decides against them,” Comcast\nCorp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (GINSBURG and\nBREYER, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 3). Doing so “does\n‘not reflect well on the processes of the Court.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Redrup v.

MBUSA imports\nmore than 200,000 vehicles into the United States and\ndistributes many of them to independent dealerships in\nCalifornia, where they are sold. Declaration of Dr. Peter\nWaskönig in Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., No. 04–\n00194–RMW (ND Cal.), ¶ 10, p. 2. MBUSA’s California\nsales account for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales, which\nwere $192 billion in 2004.4 And 2.4% of $192 billion is\n$4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure. MBUSA\nalso has multiple offices and facilities in California, in­\ncluding a regional headquarters.\n  But the record does not answer a number of other\nimportant questions. Are any of Daimler’s key files main­\ntained in MBUSA’s California offices? How many employ­\nees work in those offices? Do those employees make\nimportant strategic decisions or oversee in any manner\nDaimler’s activities? These questions could well affect\nwhether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction. After\nall, this Court upheld the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437,\n447–448 (1952)—which the majority refers to as a “text­\nbook case” of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10—on the basis\nthat the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio,\nkept corporate files there, and oversaw the company’s\nactivities from the State. California-based MBUSA em­\nployees may well have done similar things on Daimler’s\nbehalf.5 But because the Court decides the issue without a\n——————\n  4 See DaimlerChrysler, Innovations for our Customers: Annual Report\n2004, p. 22, http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/\n1364377_2004_DaimlerChrysler_Annual_Report.pdf (as visited on Jan. 8,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n  5 To be sure, many of Daimler’s key management decisions are un­\n\ndoubtedly made by employees outside California.

International Shoe Co. v.\nWashington, 326 U. S. 310, 318 (1945); see also Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,\n416 (1984) (asking whether defendant had “continuous\nand systematic general business contacts”).6 In every case\nwhere we have applied this test, we have focused solely on\nthe magnitude of the defendant’s in-state contacts, not the\nrelative magnitude of those contacts in comparison to the\ndefendant’s contacts with other States.\n  In Perkins, for example, we found an Ohio court’s exer­\n——————\ndecisions made by the company’s chief of staff in Manila and a purchas­\ning agent in California); see also n. 8, infra.\n  6 While Helicopteros formulated the general jurisdiction inquiry as\n\nasking whether a foreign defendant possesses “continuous and system­\natic general business contacts,” 466 U. S., at 416, the majority correctly\nnotes, ante, at 19, that International Shoe used the phrase “continuous\nand systematic” in the context of discussing specific jurisdiction, 326\nU. S., at 317. But the majority recognizes that International Shoe\nseparately described the type of contacts needed for general jurisdiction\nas “continuous corporate operations” that are “so substantial” as to\njustify suit on unrelated causes of action. Id., at 318. It is unclear why\nour precedents departed from International Shoe’s “continuous and\nsubstantial” formulation in favor of the “continuous and systematic”\nformulation, but the majority does not contend—nor do I perceive—that\nthere is a material difference between the two.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

Ante, at 11, n. 8. The majority is quite correct that it\nhas found a sentence in Perkins that does not address whether most of\nthe Philippine corporation’s activities took place outside of Ohio. See\nante, at 11, n. 8 (noting that Perkins described the company’s “wartime\nactivities” as “necessarily limited,” 342 U. S., at 448). That is why I did\nnot mention it. I instead rely on a sentence in Perkins’ opening para­\ngraph: “The [Philippine] corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a\ncontinuous and systematic, but limited, part of its general business.”\nId., at 438. That sentence obviously does convey that most of the\ncorporation’s activities occurred in “places other than Ohio,” ante, at 11,\nn. 8. This is not surprising given that the company’s Ohio contacts\ninvolved a single officer working from a home office, while its non-Ohio\ncontacts included significant mining properties and machinery operated\nthroughout the Philippines, Philippine employees (including a chief of\nstaff), a purchasing agent based in California, and board of directors\nmeetings held in Washington, New York, and San Francisco.

BAUMAN\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTexas.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), our analysis again\nfocused on the defendant’s in-state contacts. Goodyear\ninvolved a suit against foreign tire manufacturers by\nNorth Carolina residents whose children had died in a bus\naccident in France. We held that North Carolina courts\ncould not exercise general jurisdiction over the foreign\ndefendants. Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our\nopinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants’ con­\ntacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the\ndefendants’ lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and\nbusiness operations within the State.\n   This approach follows from the touchstone principle of\ndue process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.\nWhen a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and\nprotections of a State in which it operates, the State ac­\nquires the authority to subject the company to suit in its\ncourts. See International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319 (“[T]o the\nextent that a corporation exercises the privilege of con­\nducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and\nprotection of the laws of that state” such that an “obliga­\ntio[n] arise[s]” to respond there to suit); J. McIntyre Ma-\nchinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5) (same principle for general\njurisdiction). The majority’s focus on the extent of a corpo­\nrate defendant’s out-of-forum contacts is untethered from\nthis rationale. After all, the degree to which a company\nintentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its\ninteractions with that State, not its interactions else­\nwhere. An article on which the majority relies (and on\nwhich Goodyear relied as well, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7)) expresses the point well: “We should not treat de­\nfendants as less amenable to suit merely because they\ncarry on more substantial business in other states . . . .\n[T]he amount of activity elsewhere seems virtually irrele­\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Rev. 721, 742 (1988).\n   Had the majority applied our settled approach, it would\nhave had little trouble concluding that Daimler’s Califor­\nnia contacts rise to the requisite level, given the majority’s\nassumption that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to\nDaimler and given Daimler’s concession that those con­\ntacts render MBUSA “at home” in California. Our cases\nhave long stated the rule that a defendant’s contacts with\na forum State must be continuous, substantial, and sys­\ntematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that\nState’s general jurisdiction. See Perkins, 342 U. S., at 446.\nWe offered additional guidance in Goodyear, adding the\nphrase “essentially at home” to our prior formulation of\nthe rule. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (a State may\nexercise general jurisdiction where a defendant’s “affilia­\ntions with the State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as\nto render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum\nState”). We used the phrase “at home” to signify that in\norder for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general\njurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a\nforum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise\nthat actually is “at home” in the State. See Brilmayer,\nsupra, at 742.8\n——————\n  8 The majority views the phrase “at home” as serving a different\n\npurpose—that of requiring a comparison between a defendant’s in-state\nand out-of-state contacts. Ante, at 21, n. 20. That cannot be the correct\nunderstanding though, because among other things it would cast grave\ndoubt on Perkins—a case that Goodyear pointed to as an exemplar of\ngeneral jurisdiction, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). For if Perkins\nhad applied the majority’s newly minted proportionality test, it would\nhave come out the other way.\n  The majority apparently thinks that the Philippine corporate defend­\nant in Perkins did not have meaningful operations in places other than\nOhio. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 8. But one cannot get past the second\nsentence of Perkins before realizing that is wrong. That sentence reads:\n12                      DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Under this standard, Daimler’s concession that MBUSA\nis subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession\nthe Court accepts, ante, at 15, 17) should be dispositive.\nFor if MBUSA’s California contacts are so substantial and\nthe resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make\nMBUSA “at home” in California, the same must be true of\nDaimler when MBUSA’s contacts and benefits are viewed\nas its own. Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this\nCourt, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for\neight years of the litigation.\n                             B\n     The majority today concludes otherwise. Referring to\n——————\n“The corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a continuous and sys­\ntematic, but limited, part of its general business.” 342 U. S., at 438.\nIndeed, the facts of the case set forth by the Ohio Court of Appeals\nshow just how “limited” the company’s Ohio contacts—which included a\nsingle officer keeping files and managing affairs from his Ohio home\noffice—were in comparison with its “general business” operations\nelsewhere. By the time the suit was commenced, the company had\nresumed its considerable mining operations in the Philippines, “ ‘re­\nbuilding its properties’ ” there and purchasing “ ‘machinery, supplies\nand equipment.’ ” 88 Ohio App., at 123–124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. More­\nover, the company employed key managers in other forums, including a\npurchasing agent in San Francisco and a chief of staff in the Philip­\npines. Id., at 124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. The San Francisco purchasing\nagent negotiated the purchase of the company’s machinery and supplies\n“ ‘on the direction of the Company’s Chief of Staff in Manila,’ ” ibid., a\nfact that squarely refutes the majority’s assertion that “[a]ll of Ben­\nguet’s activities were directed by the company’s president from within\nOhio,” ante, at 11, n. 8. And the vast majority of the company’s board of\ndirectors meetings took place outside Ohio, in locations such as Wash­\nington, New York, and San Francisco. 88 Ohio App., at 125, 94 N. E.\n2d, at 8.\n    In light of these facts, it is all but impossible to reconcile the result in\nPerkins with the proportionality test the majority announces today.\nGoodyear’s use of the phrase “at home” is thus better understood to\nrequire the same general jurisdiction inquiry that Perkins required: An\nout-of-state business must have the kind of continuous and substantial\nin-state presence that a parallel local company would have.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe “continuous and systematic” contacts inquiry that has\nbeen taught to generations of first-year law students as\n“unacceptably grasping,” ante, at 19, the majority an­\nnounces the new rule that in order for a foreign defendant\nto be subject to general jurisdiction, it must not only pos­\nsess continuous and systematic contacts with a forum\nState, but those contacts must also surpass some unspeci­\nfied level when viewed in comparison to the company’s\n“nationwide and worldwide” activities. Ante, at 21, n. 20.9\n   Neither of the majority’s two rationales for this propor­\ntionality requirement is persuasive. First, the majority\nsuggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of\npredictability. Permitting general jurisdiction in every\nState where a corporation has continuous and substantial\ncontacts, the majority asserts, would “scarcely permit out­\nof-state defendants ‘to structure their primary conduct\nwith some minimum assurance as to where that conduct\nwill and will not render them liable to suit.’ ” Ante, at 21\n(quoting Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at 472). But there\nis nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multi­\nnational corporations that if they engage in continuous\nand substantial contacts with more than one State, they\nwill be subject to general jurisdiction in each one. The\nmajority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but\nsuch disagreement does not render an otherwise routine\n——————\n  9 I accept at face value the majority’s declaration that general juris­\n\ndiction is not limited to a corporation’s place of incorporation and\nprincipal place of business because “a corporation’s operations in a\nforum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the\ncorporation at home in the State.” Ante, at 20, n. 19; see also ante, at\n19. Were that not so, our analysis of the defendants’ in-state contacts\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408 (1984), and\nGoodyear would have been irrelevant, as none of the defendants in\nthose cases was sued in its place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness.\n14                DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntest unpredictable.\n   Nor is the majority’s proportionality inquiry any more\npredictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the\nmajority’s approach injects an additional layer of uncer­\ntainty because a corporate defendant must now try to\nforetell a court’s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its\ncontacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative\nsufficiency of those contacts in light of the company’s\noperations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not\neven try to explain just how extensive the company’s\nin-state contacts must be in the context of its global oper-\nations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.\n   The majority’s approach will also lead to greater unpre­\ndictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdic­\ntional discovery. Rather than ascertaining the extent of a\ncorporate defendant’s forum-state contacts alone, courts\nwill now have to identify the extent of a company’s con­\ntacts in every other forum where it does business in order\nto compare them against the company’s in-state contacts.\nThat considerable burden runs headlong into the major-\nity’s recitation of the familiar principle that “ ‘[s]imple\njurisdictional rules . . . promote greater predictability.’ ”\nAnte, at 18–19 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S.\n77, 94 (2010)).\n   Absent the predictability rationale, the majority’s sole\nremaining justification for its proportionality approach is\nits unadorned concern for the consequences. “If Daimler’s\nCalifornia activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this\nArgentina-rooted case in California,” the majority la­\nments, “the same global reach would presumably be avail­\nable in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\nsizable.” Ante, at 20.\n   The majority characterizes this result as “exorbitant,”\nibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the\nrule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that\nthere are “instances in which [a company’s] continuous\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncorporate operations within a state” are “so substantial\nand of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes\nof action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those\nactivities,” International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 318. In the\nera of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to\nhave such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be\nsubject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.\nToday, that circumstance is less rare. But that is as it\nshould be. What has changed since International Shoe is\nnot the due process principle of fundamental fairness but\nrather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was\nfair to say in the 1940’s that an out-of-state company could\nenjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it\n“essentially at home” in the State, it is fair to say today that\na multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive\nbenefits in multiple forum States that it is “essentially\nat home” in each one.\n   In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned\nwith the modern-day consequences of International Shoe’s\nconception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other\njudicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting un­\nfairness to large corporate defendants. Here, for instance,\nthe reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief. See\nsupra, at 3–4. In other cases, a defendant can assert the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a\nhighly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute. See Gulf\nOil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 508–509 (1947). In still\nother cases, the federal change of venue statute can pro­\nvide protection. See 28 U. S. C. §1404(a) (permitting\ntransfers to other districts “[f]or the convenience of parties\nand witnesses” and “in the interests of justice”). And to\nthe degree that the majority worries these doctrines are\nnot enough to protect the economic interests of multina­\ntional businesses (or that our longstanding approach to\ngeneral jurisdiction poses “risks to international comity,”\nante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns\n16                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbelongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state\nand federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the\ndemocratic process. Unfortunately, the majority short\ncircuits that process by enshrining today’s narrow rule of\ngeneral jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.\n                             C\n   The majority’s concern for the consequences of its deci­\nsion should have led it the other way, because the rule\nthat it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four\nrespects.\n   First, the majority’s approach unduly curtails the\nStates’ sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against\ncorporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and\nsubstantial business operations within their boundaries.10\nThe majority does not dispute that a State can exercise\ngeneral jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its\ncorporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of\nbusiness within the State. Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U. S., at\n93. Yet it never explains why the State should lose that\npower when, as is increasingly common, a corporation\n“divide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among\nofficers who work at several different locations.” Id., at\n95–96. Suppose a company divides its management func­\ntions equally among three offices in different States, with\none office nominally deemed the company’s corporate\nheadquarters. If the State where the headquarters is\nlocated can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the\n\n——————\n  10 States  will of course continue to exercise specific jurisdiction in\nmany cases, but we have never held that to be the outer limit of the\nStates’ authority under the Due Process Clause. That is because the\ntwo forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific\njurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant’s chal­\nlenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the\ndefendant’s substantial presence in the State irrespective of the loca­\ntion of the challenged conduct.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nother two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the\nsame? Indeed, under the majority’s approach, the result\nwould be unchanged even if the company has substantial\noperations within the latter two States (and even if the\ncompany has no sales or other business operations in the\nfirst State). Put simply, the majority’s rule defines the\nDue Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to\ncontravene the States’ sovereign prerogative to subject to\njudgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified\n“intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit\nto the[ir] laws,” J. McIntyre, 564 U. S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5).\n   Second, the proportionality approach will treat small\nbusinesses unfairly in comparison to national and multi­\nnational conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will\noften be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on\naccount of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small\nbusiness will not be. For instance, the majority holds\ntoday that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in\nCalifornia despite its multiple offices, continuous opera­\ntions, and billions of dollars’ worth of sales there. But\nimagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehi­\ncles principally targeting the California market and that\nhas substantially all of its sales and operations in the\nState—even though those sales and operations may\namount to one-thousandth of Daimler’s. Under the major­\nity’s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in\nCalifornia on any cause of action involving any of its activ­\nities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive\ncompetitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if\nthe small business incorporates and sets up its headquar­\nters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business’\nCalifornia sales and operations would still predominate\nwhen “apprais[ed]” in proportion to its minimal “nation­\nwide and worldwide” operations, ante, at 21, n. 20.\n   Third, the majority’s approach creates the incongruous\n18                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nresult that an individual defendant whose only contact\nwith a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction if served with process during that\nvisit, Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n495 U. S. 604 (1990), but a large corporation that owns\nproperty, employs workers, and does billions of dollars’\nworth of business in the State will not be, simply because\nthe corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the\nvisiting individual surely does as well).\n   Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of\nthe majority’s approach will be to shift the risk of loss\nfrom multinational corporations to the individuals harmed\nby their actions. Under the majority’s rule, for example, a\nparent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a\nforeign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will\nbe unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U. S.\ncourt, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in\nmultiple States. See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int’l Hotels, Ltd.,\n288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).11 Similarly, a U. S. business\nthat enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its\nproducts to a multinational company there may be unable\nto seek relief in any U. S. court if the multinational com­\npany breaches the contract, even if that company has\nconsiderable operations in numerous U. S. forums. See,\ne.g., Walpex Trading Co. v.

Argued October 15, 2013—Decided January 14, 2014\nPlaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who\n  filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant\n  DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public\n  stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.\n  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argenti-\n  na), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state se-\n  curity forces during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War” to kidnap,\n  detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them,\n  plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those alle-\n  gations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and\n  the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California\n  and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicat-\n  ed on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\n  another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its\n  principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daim-\n  ler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the\n  United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the\n  action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plain-\n  tiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the\n  California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler’s\n  motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court’s judgment, the\n  Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the\n  California courts’ all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler’s “agent” for\n  jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be an-\n  swerable to suit in that State.\nHeld: Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries alleged-\n ly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside\n the United States. Pp. 6–24.\n2                       DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) California’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal ju-\n    risdiction to the full extent permissible under the U. S. Constitution.\n    Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit’s holding com-\n    ports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule\n    Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 6.\n       (b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over\n    persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the fo-\n    rum. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. That rigidly territorial focus\n    eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by\n    the Court’s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Wash-\n    ington, 326 U. S. 310. International Shoe presaged the recognition of\n    two personal jurisdiction categories: One category, today called “spe-\n    cific jurisdiction,” see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.\n    Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit\n    “arise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant’s contacts with the fo-\n    rum,” Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n    408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific,\n    case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as “general ju-\n    risdiction,” exercisable when a foreign corporation’s “continuous cor-\n    porate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a na-\n    ture as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from\n    dealings entirely distinct from those activities.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n       Since International Shoe, “specific jurisdiction has become the cen-\n    terpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n    This Court’s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.\n    See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, Helicopte-\n    ros, 466 U. S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. As is evident\n    from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdic-\n    tion has been cut loose from Pennoyer’s sway, general jurisdiction has\n    not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 6–14.\n       (c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qual-\n    ifies as at home in California, Daimler’s affiliations with California\n    are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that\n    State’s courts. Pp. 14–23.\n          (1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of\n    general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals’ analysis in this case can-\n    not be sustained. The Ninth Circuit’s agency determination rested\n    primarily on its observation that MBUSA’s services were “important”\n    to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to perform\n    those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if “importan[ce]” in\n    this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign\n    corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever\n    they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would\n    sweep beyond even the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” re-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  jected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___. Pp. 15–17.\n       (2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and\n  that MBUSA’s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be\n  no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The\n  paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corpora-\n  tion’s place of incorporation and principal place of business. Good-\n  year, 564 U. S., at ___. Plaintiffs’ reasoning, however, would reach\n  well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general\n  jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation “engages in a sub-\n  stantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.” Brief for\n  Respondents 16–17, and nn. 7–8. The words “continuous and sys-\n  tematic,” plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in\n  International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of spe-\n  cific jurisdiction would be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317. With\n  respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead\n  of “instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n  state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit . . . on\n  causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those ac-\n  tivities.” Id., at 318. Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has\n  explained, is whether a foreign corporation’s “affiliations with the\n  State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to render [it] essentially\n  at home in the forum State.” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n     Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor\n  does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daim-\n  ler’s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argen-\n  tina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presuma-\n  bly be available in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\n  sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general juris-\n  diction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to\n  conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to it,\n  was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims\n  by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred\n  or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 18–21.\n       (3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears atten-\n  tion. This Court’s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs’\n  Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See Ki-\n  obel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___, and Mohamad\n  v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___. The Ninth Circuit, more-\n  over, paid little heed to the risks to international comity posed by its\n  expansive view of general jurisdiction.

The litigation com-\nmenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents1\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California against DaimlerChrysler\nAktiengesellschaft (Daimler),2 a German public stock\ncompany, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures\nMercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.           The complaint\nalleged that during Argentina’s 1976–1983 “Dirty War,”\nDaimler’s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argen-\ntina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security\nforces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB\n——————\n   1 One plaintiff is a resident of Argentina and a citizen of Chile; all\n\nother plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Argentina.\n   2 Daimler was restructured in 2007 and is now known as Daimler AG.\n\nNo party contends that any postsuit corporate reorganization bears on\nour disposition of this case. This opinion refers to members of the\nDaimler corporate family by the names current at the time plaintiffs\nfiled suit.\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArgentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons\nclosely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged\nhuman-rights violations were sought from Daimler under\nthe laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.\nJurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the Cali-\nfornia contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\na subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with\nits principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA\ndistributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independ-\nent dealerships throughout the United States, including\nCalifornia.\n   The question presented is whether the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the Dis-\ntrict Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case, given the absence of any California connection\nto the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court’s general or all-\npurpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place\nwhere Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against\nit, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For exam-\nple, as plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed, under the proffered\njurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle\noverturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passen-\nger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit\nin California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–29. Exercises of\npersonal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by\ndue process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory\nauthority.\n   In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between\ngeneral or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-\nlinked jurisdiction. As to the former, we held that a court\nmay assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation “to hear\nany and all claims against [it]” only when the corporation’s\naffiliations with the State in which suit is brought are\nso constant and pervasive “as to render [it] essentially at\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In-\nstructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not “at\nhome” in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries\nplaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina’s conduct in Argentina.\n                              I\n  In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with\nArgentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, tor-\nture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the\nmilitary dictatorship in place there from 1976 through\n1983, a period known as Argentina’s “Dirty War.” Based\non those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the\nAlien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. §1350, and the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following\n28 U. S. C. §1350, as well as claims for wrongful death and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws\nof California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in\nthe complaint center on MB Argentina’s plant in Gonzalez\nCatan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina’s alleged col-\nlaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in Cali-\nfornia or anywhere else in the United States.\n  Plaintiffs’ operative complaint names only one corporate\ndefendant: Daimler, the petitioner here. Plaintiffs seek to\nhold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina’s alleged\nmalfeasance. Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft\n(public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz\nvehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in\nStuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina\nwas a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler’s predecessor\nin interest.\n  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal\njurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted\ndeclarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the\npresence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively,\n4                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could\nbe founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a dis-\ntinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should\nbe treated as Daimler’s agent for jurisdictional purposes.\n  MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Dela-\nware limited liability corporation.3 MBUSA serves as\nDaimler’s exclusive importer and distributor in the United\nStates, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from\nDaimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and\nultimately distributing them to independent dealerships\nlocated throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA’s prin-\ncipal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has\nmultiple California-based facilities, including a regional\noffice in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in\nCarson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the\nrecord developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of\nluxury vehicles to the California market. In particular,\nover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States\ntake place in California, and MBUSA’s California sales\naccount for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales.\n  The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delin-\neated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets\nforth requirements for MBUSA’s distribution of Mercedes-\nBenz vehicles in the United States. That agreement\nestablished MBUSA as an “independent contracto[r]”\nthat “buy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] . . . as an independent\nbusiness for [its] own account.” App. 179a. The agree-\nment “does not make [MBUSA] . . . a general or special\nagent, partner, joint venturer or employee of\nDAIMLERCHRYSLER or any DaimlerChrysler Group\nCompany”; MBUSA “ha[s] no authority to make binding\nobligations for or act on behalf of DAIMLERCHRYSLER\nor any DaimlerChrysler Group Company.” Ibid.\n——————\n 3 At times relevant to this suit, MBUSA was wholly owned by Daimler-\n\nChrysler North America Holding Corporation, a Daimler subsidiary.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Daimler’s own affiliations with Cali-\nfornia, the court first determined, were insufficient to\nsupport the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the\ncorporation. Bauman v.

Next, the\ncourt declined to attribute MBUSA’s California contacts to\nDaimler on an agency theory, concluding that plaintiffs\nfailed to demonstrate that MBUSA acted as Daimler’s\nagent.

Addressing solely the question of agency, the\nCourt of Appeals held that plaintiffs had not shown the\nexistence of an agency relationship of the kind that might\nwarrant attribution of MBUSA’s contacts to Daimler.\nBauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 579 F. 3d 1088, 1096–\n1097 (2009). Judge Reinhardt dissented. In his view, the\nagency test was satisfied and considerations of “reason-\nableness” did not bar the exercise of jurisdiction. Id., at\n1098–1106. Granting plaintiffs’ petition for rehearing, the\npanel withdrew its initial opinion and replaced it with one\nauthored by Judge Reinhardt, which elaborated on reason-\ning he initially expressed in dissent. Bauman v. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909 (CA9 2011).\n  Daimler petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nurging that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over\nDaimler could not be reconciled with this Court’s decision\nin Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011). Over the dissent of eight judges, the\nNinth Circuit denied Daimler’s petition. See Bauman v.\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 676 F. 3d 774 (2011) (O’Scannlain,\n6                  DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nDaimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims\ninvolving only foreign plaintiffs and conduct occurring\nentirely abroad. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determin-\ning the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to\nestablish personal jurisdiction over a defendant “who is\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction\nin the state where the district court is located”). Under\nCalifornia’s long-arm statute, California state courts may\nexercise personal jurisdiction “on any basis not incon-\nsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United\nStates.” Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. §410.10 (West 2004).\nCalifornia’s long-arm statute allows the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the\nU. S. Constitution. We therefore inquire whether the\nNinth Circuit’s holding comports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 464 (1985).\n                               III\n   In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878), decided shortly\nafter the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\nCourt held that a tribunal’s jurisdiction over persons\nreaches no farther than the geographic bounds of the\nforum. See id., at 720 (“The authority of every tribunal is\nnecessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State\nin which it is established.”). See also Shaffer v. Heitner,\n433 U. S. 186, 197 (1977) (Under Pennoyer, “any attempt\n‘directly’ to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons\nor property would offend sister States and exceed the\n                    Cite as: 571 U.

In time, however,\nthat strict territorial approach yielded to a less rigid un-\nderstanding, spurred by “changes in the technology of\ntransportation and communication, and the tremendous\ngrowth of interstate business activity.” Burnham v. Supe-\nrior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 617\n(1990) (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\n   “The canonical opinion in this area remains Interna-\ntional Shoe [Co. v. Washington], 326 U. S. 310 [(1945)], in\nwhich we held that a State may authorize its courts to\nexercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defend-\nant if the defendant has ‘certain minimum contacts with\n[the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not\noffend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.” ’ ” Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quot-\ning International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316). Following\nInternational Shoe, “the relationship among the defend-\nant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually\nexclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of\nPennoyer rest, became the central concern of the inquiry\ninto personal jurisdiction.” Shaffer, 433 U.

The\ndefendant in Perkins, Benguet, was a company incorpo-\nrated under the laws of the Philippines, where it operated\ngold and silver mines.

See post, at 11–12, n. 8 (opinion concurring in\njudgment) (“By the time the suit [in Perkins] was commenced, the\ncompany had resumed its considerable operations in the Philippines,”\n“rebuilding its properties there” and “purchasing machinery, supplies\nand equipment.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). See also post, at\n7–8, n. 5 (many of the corporation’s “key management decisions” were\nmade by the out-of-state purchasing agent and chief of staff ). JUSTICE\nSOTOMAYOR’s account overlooks this Court’s opinion in Perkins and the\npoint on which that opinion turned: All of Benguet’s activities were\ndirected by the company’s president from within Ohio. See Perkins v.\nBenguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, 447–448 (1952) (company’s\nPhilippine mining operations “were completely halted during the\noccupation . . . by the Japanese”; and the company’s president, from his\nOhio office, “supervised policies dealing with the rehabilitation of the\ncorporation’s properties in the Philippines and . . . dispatched funds to\ncover purchases of machinery for such rehabilitation”). On another\nday, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joined a unanimous Court in recognizing: “To\nthe extent that the company was conducting any business during and\nimmediately after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, it was\ndoing so in Ohio . . . .” Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.

S. citizens\nperished in that accident; their survivors and representa-\ntives brought suit in Texas state court against the helicop-\nter’s owner and operator, a Colombian corporation. That\ncompany’s contacts with Texas were confined to “sending\nits chief executive officer to Houston for a contract-\nnegotiation session; accepting into its New York bank\naccount checks drawn on a Houston bank; purchasing\nhelicopters, equipment, and training services from [a\nTexas-based helicopter company] for substantial sums;\nand sending personnel to [Texas] for training.” Id., at 416.\nNotably, those contacts bore no apparent relationship to\nthe accident that gave rise to the suit. We held that the\ncompany’s Texas connections did not resemble the “con-\ntinuous and systematic general business contacts . . .\nfound to exist in Perkins.” Ibid. “[M]ere purchases, even\nif occurring at regular intervals,” we clarified, “are not\nenough to warrant a State’s assertion of in personam\njurisdiction over a nonresident corporation in a cause of\naction not related to those purchase transactions.” Id., at\n418.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear, we answered the question:\n“Are foreign subsidiaries of a United States parent corpo-\nration amenable to suit in state court on claims unrelated\nto any activity of the subsidiaries in the forum State?” 564\nU.

Those\nforeign subsidiaries, which manufactured tires for sale in\nEurope and Asia, lacked any affiliation with North Caro-\nlina. A small percentage of tires manufactured by the\nforeign subsidiaries were distributed in North Carolina,\nhowever, and on that ground, the North Carolina Court of\nAppeals held the subsidiaries amenable to the general\njurisdiction of North Carolina courts.\n   We reversed, observing that the North Carolina court’s\nanalysis “elided the essential difference between case-\nspecific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10). Although the placement of a product into\nthe stream of commerce “may bolster an affiliation ger-\nmane to specific jurisdiction,” we explained, such contacts\n“do not warrant a determination that, based on those ties,\nthe forum has general jurisdiction over a defendant.” Id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 10–11). As International Shoe itself\nteaches, a corporation’s “continuous activity of some sorts\nwithin a state is not enough to support the demand that\nthe corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that\nactivity.” 326 U.

Chi. Legal\nForum 119, 139 (“[G]eneral jurisdiction exists as an imperfect safety\nvalve that sometimes allows plaintiffs access to a reasonable forum in\ncases when specific jurisdiction would deny it.”).\n   10 Remarkably, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR treats specific jurisdiction as\n\nthough it were barely there. Given the many decades in which specific\njurisdiction has flourished, it would be hard to conjure up an example of\nthe “deep injustice” JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR predicts as a consequence of\nour holding that California is not an all-purpose forum for suits against\nDaimler. Post, at 16. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR identifies “the concept of\nreciprocal fairness” as the “touchstone principle of due process in this\nfield.” Post, at 10 (citing International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319). She over-\nlooks, however, that in the very passage of International Shoe on which\nshe relies, the Court left no doubt that it was addressing specific—\nnot general—jurisdiction. See id., at 319 (“The exercise of th[e]\nprivilege [of conducting corporate activities within a State] may give\nrise to obligations, and, so far as those obligations arise out of or are\nconnected with the activities within the state, a procedure which re-\nquires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can,\nin most instances, hardly be said to be undue.” (emphasis added)).\n   11 As the Court made plain in Goodyear and repeats here, general\n\njurisdiction requires affiliations “so ‘continuous and systematic’ as to\nrender [the foreign corporation] essentially at home in the forum State.”\n564 U.

In the proceedings\nbelow, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain\npoints we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never at-\ntempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction cate-\ngory. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District\nCourt’s holding that Daimler’s own contacts with Califor-\nnia were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exer-\ncise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately\npersuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA’s Califor-\nnia contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point\nhave they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of\nDaimler.\n   Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to\nplaintiffs’ assertion that the California courts could exer-\ncise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.12 But see Brief\nfor Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of Good-\nyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction\nin California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16, n. 5 (hereinafter U. S. Brief) (same). We will assume\nthen, for purposes of this decision only, that MBUSA\nqualifies as at home in California.\n                             A\n  In sustaining the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nDaimler, the Ninth Circuit relied on an agency theory,\ndetermining that MBUSA acted as Daimler’s agent for\njurisdictional purposes and then attributing MBUSA’s\nCalifornia contacts to Daimler. The Ninth Circuit’s agency\nanalysis derived from Circuit precedent considering\nprincipally whether the subsidiary “performs services that\nare sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if\nit did not have a representative to perform them, the\n——————\n 12 MBUSA   is not a defendant in this case.\n16                     DAIMLER AG v.

Unocal Corp., 248 F. 3d 915, 928 (CA9 2001); em-\nphasis deleted).\n   This Court has not yet addressed whether a foreign\ncorporation may be subjected to a court’s general jurisdic-\ntion based on the contacts of its in-state subsidiary. Daim-\nler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a\nsubsidiary’s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its\nparent only when the former is so dominated by the latter\nas to be its alter ego. The Ninth Circuit adopted a less\nrigorous test based on what it described as an “agency”\nrelationship. Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and\nshapes: “One may be an agent for some business purposes\nand not others so that the fact that one may be an agent\nfor one purpose does not make him or her an agent for\nevery purpose.” 2A C. J. S., Agency §43, p. 367 (2013)\n(footnote omitted).13 A subsidiary, for example, might be\n——————\n  13 Agency   relationships, we have recognized, may be relevant to the\nexistence of specific jurisdiction. “[T]he corporate personality,” Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), observed, “is a\nfiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a\nfact.” Id., at 316. See generally 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of\nCorporations §30, p. 30 (Supp. 2012–2013) (“A corporation is a distinct\nlegal entity that can act only through its agents.”). As such, a corpora-\ntion can purposefully avail itself of a forum by directing its agents or\ndistributors to take action there. See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U. S., at 112\n(opinion of O’Connor, J.) (defendant’s act of “marketing [a] product\nthrough a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the\nforum State” may amount to purposeful availment); International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (“the commission of some single or occasional acts of\nthe corporate agent in a state” may sometimes “be deemed sufficient to\nrender the corporation liable to suit” on related claims). See also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24 (acknowledging that “an agency relationship may be\nsufficient in some circumstances to give rise to specific jurisdiction”). It\ndoes not inevitably follow, however, that similar reasoning applies to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Cf. Goodyear, 564 U.

The Court of Appeals did not advert to\nthat prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invoca-\ntion of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdic-\ntion, for in no event can the appeals court’s analysis be\nsustained.\n   The Ninth Circuit’s agency finding rested primarily on\nits observation that MBUSA’s services were “important” to\nDaimler, as gauged by Daimler’s hypothetical readiness to\nperform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.\nFormulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks\nthe deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer:\n“Anything a corporation does through an independent\ncontractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably some-\nthing that the corporation would do ‘by other means’ if the\nindependent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not\nexist.” 676 F. 3d, at 777 (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).14 The Ninth Circuit’s agency\ntheory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to\ngeneral jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state sub-\nsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond\neven the “sprawling view of general jurisdiction” we re-\njected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).15\n——————\n  14 Indeed, plaintiffs do not defend this aspect of the Ninth Circuit’s\n\nanalysis. See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 18 (“We do not believe that\nthis gloss is particularly helpful.”).\n  15 The Ninth Circuit’s agency analysis also looked to whether the\n\nparent enjoys “the right to substantially control” the subsidiary’s\nactivities. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909, 924\n(2011). The Court of Appeals found the requisite “control” demon-\nstrated by the General Distributor Agreement between Daimler and\nMBUSA, which gives Daimler the right to oversee certain of MBUSA’s\noperations, even though that agreement expressly disavowed the\ncreation of any agency relationship. Thus grounded, the separate\ninquiry into control hardly curtails the overbreadth of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit’s agency holding.\n18                     DAIMLER AG v.

Post, at 5–6. That assertion is doubly flawed.\nFirst, the question on which we granted certiorari, as stated in Daim-\nler’s petition, is “whether it violates due process for a court to exercise\ngeneral personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based solely on\nthe fact that an indirect corporate subsidiary performs services on\nbehalf of the defendant in the forum State.” Pet. for Cert. i. That\nquestion fairly encompasses an inquiry into whether, in light of Good-\nyear, Daimler can be considered at home in California based on\nMBUSA’s in-state activities. See also this Court’s Rule 14.1(a) (a\nparty’s statement of the question presented “is deemed to comprise\nevery subsidiary question fairly included therein”). Moreover, both in\nthe Ninth Circuit, see, e.g., Brief for Federation of German Industries\net al. as Amici Curiae in No. 07–15386 (CA9), p. 3, and in this Court,\nsee, e.g., U. S.

These bases afford plain-\ntiffs recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in\nwhich a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all\nclaims.\n   Goodyear did not hold that a corporation may be subject\nto general jurisdiction only in a forum where it is incor-\nporated or has its principal place of business; it simply\ntyped those places paradigm all-purpose forums. Plaintiffs\nwould have us look beyond the exemplar bases Goodyear\nidentified, and approve the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin every State in which a corporation “engages in a sub-\nstantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.”\nBrief for Respondents 16–17, and nn. 7–8. That formula-\ntion, we hold, is unacceptably grasping.\n   As noted, see supra, at 7–8, the words “continuous and\nsystematic” were used in International Shoe to describe\ninstances in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction\nwould be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317 (jurisdiction\ncan be asserted where a corporation’s in-state activities\nare not only “continuous and systematic, but also give rise\nto the liabilities sued on”).17 Turning to all-purpose juris-\ndiction, in contrast, International Shoe speaks of “instances\nin which the continuous corporate operations within a\nstate [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify\n——————\n    17 International Shoe also recognized, as noted above, see supra, at 7–8,\n\nthat “some single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state\n. . . , because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their\ncommission, may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable\nto suit.” 326 U. S., at 318.\n20                     DAIMLER AG v.

See also Twitchell, Why We Keep Doing Business\nWith Doing-Business Jurisdiction, 2001 U. Chi. Legal\nForum 171, 184 (International Shoe “is clearly not saying\nthat dispute-blind jurisdiction exists whenever ‘continuous\nand systematic’ contacts are found.”).18 Accordingly, the\ninquiry under Goodyear is not whether a foreign corpora-\ntion’s in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense\n“continuous and systematic,” it is whether that corpora-\ntion’s “affiliations with the State are so ‘continuous and\nsystematic’ as to render [it] essentially at home in the\nforum State.” 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).19\n   Here, neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in\n——————\n  18 Plaintiffs emphasize two decisions, Barrow S. S. Co. v. Kane, 170\nU. S. 100 (1898), and Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259,\n115 N. E. 915 (1917) (Cardozo, J.), both cited in Perkins v. Benguet\nConsol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), just after the statement that\na corporation’s continuous operations in-state may suffice to establish\ngeneral jurisdiction. Id., at 446, and n. 6. See also International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (citing Tauza). Barrow and Tauza indeed upheld the\nexercise of general jurisdiction based on the presence of a local office,\nwhich signaled that the corporation was “doing business” in the forum.\nPerkins’ unadorned citations to these cases, both decided in the era\ndominated by Pennoyer’s territorial thinking, see supra, at 6–7, should\nnot attract heavy reliance today. See generally Feder, Goodyear,\n“Home,” and the Uncertain Future of Doing Business Jurisdiction, 63\nS. C. L. Rev. 671 (2012) (questioning whether “doing business” should\npersist as a basis for general jurisdiction).\n   19 We do not foreclose the possibility that in an exceptional case, see,\n\ne.g., Perkins, described supra, at 10–12, and n. 8, a corporation’s opera-\ntions in a forum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal\nplace of business may be so substantial and of such a nature as to\nrender the corporation at home in that State. But this case presents no\noccasion to explore that question, because Daimler’s activities in\nCalifornia plainly do not approach that level. It is one thing to hold a\ncorporation answerable for operations in the forum State, see infra, at\n23, quite another to expose it to suit on claims having no connection\nwhatever to the forum State.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

If Daimler’s California activities suf-\nficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in\nCalifornia, the same global reach would presumably be\navailable in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\nsizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdic-\ntion would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants “to\nstructure their primary conduct with some minimum\nassurance as to where that conduct will and will not ren-\nder them liable to suit.” Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at\n472 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude\nthat Daimler, even with MBUSA’s contacts attributed to\nit, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit\nthere on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do\nwith anything that occurred or had its principal impact in\nCalifornia.20\n——————\n   20 To clarify in light of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s opinion concurring in the\n\njudgment, the general jurisdiction inquiry does not “focu[s] solely on the\nmagnitude of the defendant’s in-state contacts.” Post, at 8. General\njurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation’s activities in\ntheir entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A corporation that operates\nin many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Other-\nwise, “at home” would be synonymous with “doing business” tests\nframed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States. See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1142–1144. Nothing in International Shoe\nand its progeny suggests that “a particular quantum of local activity”\nshould give a State authority over a “far larger quantum of . . . activity”\nhaving no connection to any in-state activity. Feder, supra, at 694.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reach the same result, but for a different\nreason. Rather than concluding that Daimler is not at home in Cali-\nfornia, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would hold that the exercise of general\njurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable “in the unique circum-\nstances of this case.” Post, at 1. In other words, she favors a resolution\nfit for this day and case only. True, a multipronged reasonableness\ncheck was articulated in Asahi, 480 U. S., at 113–114, but not as a free-\nfloating test. Instead, the check was to be essayed when specific\njurisdiction is at issue. See also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\nU. S. 462, 476–478 (1985). First, a court is to determine whether the\n22                     DAIMLER AG v.

The Court of Appeals emphasized, as support-\nive of the exercise of general jurisdiction, plaintiffs’ asser-\ntion of claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28\nU. S. C. §1350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of\n1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C.\n§1350. See 644 F. 3d, at 927 (“American federal courts, be\nthey in California or any other state, have a strong inter-\nest in adjudicating and redressing international human\nrights abuses.”). Recent decisions of this Court, however,\nhave rendered plaintiffs’ ATS and TVPA claims infirm.\nSee Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (presumption against extra-\nterritorial application controls claims under the ATS);\nMohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n——————\nconnection between the forum and the episode-in-suit could justify the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction. Then, in a second step, the court is to\nconsider several additional factors to assess the reasonableness of\nentertaining the case. When a corporation is genuinely at home in the\nforum State, however, any second-step inquiry would be superfluous.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR fears that our holding will “lead to greater un-\npredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional dis-\ncovery.” Post, at 14. But it is hard to see why much in the way of\ndiscovery would be needed to determine where a corporation is at home.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s proposal to import Asahi’s “reasonableness” check\ninto the general jurisdiction determination, on the other hand, would\nindeed compound the jurisdictional inquiry. The reasonableness factors\nidentified in Asahi include “the burden on the defendant,” “the interests\nof the forum State,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining relief,” “the\ninterstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient\nresolution of controversies,” “the shared interest of the several States in\nfurthering fundamental substantive social policies,” and, in the inter-\nnational context, “the procedural and substantive policies of other\nnations whose interests are affected by the assertion of jurisdiction.”\n480 U. S., at 113–115 (some internal quotation marks omitted). Impos-\ning such a checklist in cases of general jurisdiction would hardly\npromote the efficient disposition of an issue that should be resolved\nexpeditiously at the outset of litigation.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

Other nations do not share the uninhibited\napproach to personal jurisdiction advanced by the Court of\nAppeals in this case. In the European Union, for example,\na corporation may generally be sued in the nation in which\nit is “domiciled,” a term defined to refer only to the loca-\ntion of the corporation’s “statutory seat,” “central admin-\nistration,” or “principal place of business.” European\nParliament and Council Reg. 1215/2012, Arts. 4(1), and\n63(1), 2012 O. J. (L. 351) 7, 18. See also id., Art. 7(5), 2012\nO. J. 7 (as to “a dispute arising out of the operations of a\nbranch, agency or other establishment,” a corporation may\nbe sued “in the courts for the place where the branch,\nagency or other establishment is situated” (emphasis\nadded)). The Solicitor General informs us, in this regard,\nthat “foreign governments’ objections to some domestic\ncourts’ expansive views of general jurisdiction have in the\npast impeded negotiations of international agreements on\nthe reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments.”\nU.

It has multiple facilities\nin the State, including a regional headquarters. Each\nyear, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars,\nthe sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year\nthis suit was brought. And it provides service and sales\nsupport to customers throughout the State. Daimler has\nconceded that California courts may exercise general\njurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts,\nand the Court assumes that MBUSA’s contacts may be\nattributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether\nDaimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.\n  Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that\nthey are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process\njurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that\nDaimler’s contacts with California are too few, but that its\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncontacts with other forums are too many. In other words,\nthe Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple\noffices, the direct distribution of thousands of products\naccounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous\ninteraction with customers throughout a State would be\nenough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nsome businesses. Daimler is just not one of those busi­\nnesses, the Court concludes, because its California con­\ntacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive “na­\ntionwide and worldwide” operations. Ante, at 21, n. 20. In\nrecent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the\nconcept of multinational corporations that are supposedly\n“too big to fail”; today the Court deems Daimler “too big for\ngeneral jurisdiction.”\n   The Court’s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both\nprocess and substance. As to process, the Court decides\nthis case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed\non below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a\nfootnote to its brief. Brief for Petitioner 31–32, n. 5. As\nto substance, the Court’s focus on Daimler’s operations out­\nside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal\njurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defend­\nant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently\ntaken advantage of the State’s laws and protections\nthrough its contacts in the State; whether the defendant\nhas contacts elsewhere is immaterial.\n   Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can\nand should decide this case on the far simpler ground that,\nno matter how extensive Daimler’s contacts with Califor­\nnia, that State’s exercise of jurisdiction would be unrea­\nsonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs\nsuing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and\ngiven that a more appropriate forum is available. Because\nI would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I\nconcur in the judgment only.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

The contacts prong asks whether the defendant\nhas sufficient contacts with the forum State to support\npersonal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks\nwhether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable\nunder the circumstances. Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475–478 (1985). As the majority\npoints out, all of the cases in which we have applied the\nreasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Ante, at 21, n. 20. Whether the\nreasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdic­\ntion context is therefore a question we have never decided,1\nand it is one on which I can appreciate the arguments on\nboth sides. But it would be imprudent to decide that\nquestion in this case given that respondents have failed to\nargue against the application of the reasonableness prong\nduring the entire 8-year history of this litigation. See\nBrief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application\n\n——————\n   1 The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that the reasonableness\n\nprong does in fact apply in the general jurisdiction context. See Metro-\npolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F. 3d 560, 573 (CA2\n1996) (“[E]very circuit that has considered the question has held,\nimplicitly or explicitly, that the reasonableness inquiry is applicable to\nall questions of personal jurisdiction, general or specific”); see also, e.g.,\nLakin v.

Without the\nbenefit of a single page of briefing on the issue, the majority casually\nadds each of these cases to the mounting list of decisions jettisoned as a\nconsequence of today’s ruling. See ante, at 21, n. 20.\n4                     DAIMLER AG v.

Superior Court of Cal., Solano\nCty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987): “the burden on the defendant,\nthe interests of the forum State,” “the plaintiff ’s interest\nin obtaining relief ” in the forum State, and the interests of\nother sovereigns in resolving the dispute. Id., at 113–114.\nWe held in Asahi that it would be “unreasonable and\nunfair” for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a\nclaim between a Taiwanese plaintiff and a Japanese de­\nfendant that arose out of a transaction in Taiwan, particu­\nlarly where the Taiwanese plaintiff had not shown that it\nwould be more convenient to litigate in California than in\nTaiwan or Japan. Id., at 114.\n  The same considerations resolve this case. It involves\nArgentine plaintiffs suing a German defendant for conduct\nthat took place in Argentina. Like the plaintiffs in Asahi,\nrespondents have failed to show that it would be more\nconvenient to litigate in California than in Germany, a\n——————\n    2 While\n          our decisions rejecting the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nhave typically done so under the minimum-contacts prong, we have\nnever required that prong to be decided first. See Asahi Metal Industry\nCo. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102, 121 (1987)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting\npersonal jurisdiction under the reasonableness prong and declining to\nconsider the minimum-contacts prong because doing so would not be\n“necessary”). And although the majority frets that deciding this case on\nthe reasonableness ground would be “a resolution fit for this day and\ncase only,” ante, at 21, n. 20, I do not understand our constitutional\nduty to require otherwise.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Asahi thus makes clear that it would be unrea­\nsonable for a court in California to subject Daimler to its\njurisdiction.\n                              II\n  The majority evidently agrees that, if the reasonable­\nness prong were to apply, it would be unreasonable for\nCalifornia courts to exercise jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case. See ante, at 20–21 (noting that it would be “exor­\nbitant” for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction\nover Daimler, a German defendant, in this “Argentina­\nrooted case” brought by “foreign plaintiffs”). But instead\nof resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the\nmajority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued\nnor decided below.3\n  We generally do not pass on arguments that lower\ncourts have not addressed. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). After all, “we are a court of\nreview, not of first view.” Ibid. This principle carries even\ngreater force where the argument at issue was never\npressed below. See Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198,\n205 (2001). Yet the majority disregards this principle,\nbasing its decision on an argument raised for the first time\n——————\n  3 The majority appears to suggest that Daimler may have presented\n\nthe argument in its petition for rehearing en banc before the Ninth\nCircuit. See ante, at 5 (stating that Daimler “urg[ed] that the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction . . . could not be reconciled with this Court’s\ndecision in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011)”). But Daimler’s petition for rehearing did not argue\nwhat the Court holds today. The Court holds that Daimler’s Califor-\nnia contacts would be insufficient for general jurisdiction even assum­\ning that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to Daimler. Daimler’s\nrehearing petition made a distinct argument—that attribution of\nMBUSA’s contacts should not be permitted under an “ ‘agency’ theory”\nbecause doing so would “rais[e] significant constitutional concerns”\nunder Goodyear.

We granted\ncertiorari on the question “whether it violates due process\nfor a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a\nforeign corporation based solely on the fact that an indi­\nrect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of\nthe defendant in the forum State.” Pet. for Cert. i. At no\npoint in Daimler’s petition for certiorari did the company\ncontend that, even if this attribution question were de­\ncided against it, its contacts in California would still be in-\nsufficient to support general jurisdiction. The parties’ merits\nbriefs accordingly focused on the attribution-of-contacts\nquestion, addressing the reasonableness inquiry (which\nhad been litigated and decided below) in most of the space\nthat remained. See Brief for Petitioner 17–37, 37–43;\nBrief for Respondents 18–47, 47–59.\n  In bypassing the question on which we granted certio­\nrari to decide an issue not litigated below, the Court leaves\nrespondents “without an unclouded opportunity to air\nthe issue the Court today decides against them,” Comcast\nCorp. v. Behrend, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (GINSBURG and\nBREYER, JJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 3). Doing so “does\n‘not reflect well on the processes of the Court.’ ” Ibid.\n(quoting Redrup v.

MBUSA imports\nmore than 200,000 vehicles into the United States and\ndistributes many of them to independent dealerships in\nCalifornia, where they are sold. Declaration of Dr. Peter\nWaskönig in Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., No. 04–\n00194–RMW (ND Cal.), ¶ 10, p. 2. MBUSA’s California\nsales account for 2.4% of Daimler’s worldwide sales, which\nwere $192 billion in 2004.4 And 2.4% of $192 billion is\n$4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure. MBUSA\nalso has multiple offices and facilities in California, in­\ncluding a regional headquarters.\n  But the record does not answer a number of other\nimportant questions. Are any of Daimler’s key files main­\ntained in MBUSA’s California offices? How many employ­\nees work in those offices? Do those employees make\nimportant strategic decisions or oversee in any manner\nDaimler’s activities? These questions could well affect\nwhether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction.

S. 437,\n447–448 (1952)—which the majority refers to as a “text­\nbook case” of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10—on the basis\nthat the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio,\nkept corporate files there, and oversaw the company’s\nactivities from the State. California-based MBUSA em­\nployees may well have done similar things on Daimler’s\nbehalf.5 But because the Court decides the issue without a\n——————\n  4 See DaimlerChrysler, Innovations for our Customers: Annual Report\n2004, p. 22, http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/\n1364377_2004_DaimlerChrysler_Annual_Report.pdf (as visited on Jan. 8,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\n  5 To be sure, many of Daimler’s key management decisions are un­\n\ndoubtedly made by employees outside California.

International Shoe Co. v.\nWashington, 326 U. S. 310, 318 (1945); see also Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,\n416 (1984) (asking whether defendant had “continuous\nand systematic general business contacts”).6 In every case\nwhere we have applied this test, we have focused solely on\nthe magnitude of the defendant’s in-state contacts, not the\nrelative magnitude of those contacts in comparison to the\ndefendant’s contacts with other States.\n  In Perkins, for example, we found an Ohio court’s exer­\n——————\ndecisions made by the company’s chief of staff in Manila and a purchas­\ning agent in California); see also n. 8, infra.\n  6 While Helicopteros formulated the general jurisdiction inquiry as\n\nasking whether a foreign defendant possesses “continuous and system­\natic general business contacts,” 466 U. S., at 416, the majority correctly\nnotes, ante, at 19, that International Shoe used the phrase “continuous\nand systematic” in the context of discussing specific jurisdiction, 326\nU. S., at 317. But the majority recognizes that International Shoe\nseparately described the type of contacts needed for general jurisdiction\nas “continuous corporate operations” that are “so substantial” as to\njustify suit on unrelated causes of action. Id., at 318. It is unclear why\nour precedents departed from International Shoe’s “continuous and\nsubstantial” formulation in favor of the “continuous and systematic”\nformulation, but the majority does not contend—nor do I perceive—that\nthere is a material difference between the two.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

See id., at 438 (noting that the defendant’s\nOhio contacts, while “continuous and systematic,” were\nbut a “limited . . . part of its general business”).7\n   We engaged in the same inquiry in Helicopteros. There,\nwe held that a Colombian corporation was not subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction in Texas simply because it occasion­\nally sent its employees into the State, accepted checks\ndrawn on a Texas bank, and purchased equipment and\nservices from a Texas company.

Ante, at 11, n. 8. The majority is quite correct that it\nhas found a sentence in Perkins that does not address whether most of\nthe Philippine corporation’s activities took place outside of Ohio. See\nante, at 11, n. 8 (noting that Perkins described the company’s “wartime\nactivities” as “necessarily limited,” 342 U. S., at 448). That is why I did\nnot mention it. I instead rely on a sentence in Perkins’ opening para­\ngraph: “The [Philippine] corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a\ncontinuous and systematic, but limited, part of its general business.”\nId., at 438. That sentence obviously does convey that most of the\ncorporation’s activities occurred in “places other than Ohio,” ante, at 11,\nn. 8. This is not surprising given that the company’s Ohio contacts\ninvolved a single officer working from a home office, while its non-Ohio\ncontacts included significant mining properties and machinery operated\nthroughout the Philippines, Philippine employees (including a chief of\nstaff), a purchasing agent based in California, and board of directors\nmeetings held in Washington, New York, and San Francisco.

BAUMAN\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTexas.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), our analysis again\nfocused on the defendant’s in-state contacts. Goodyear\ninvolved a suit against foreign tire manufacturers by\nNorth Carolina residents whose children had died in a bus\naccident in France. We held that North Carolina courts\ncould not exercise general jurisdiction over the foreign\ndefendants. Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our\nopinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants’ con­\ntacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the\ndefendants’ lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and\nbusiness operations within the State.\n   This approach follows from the touchstone principle of\ndue process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.\nWhen a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and\nprotections of a State in which it operates, the State ac­\nquires the authority to subject the company to suit in its\ncourts. See International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319 (“[T]o the\nextent that a corporation exercises the privilege of con­\nducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and\nprotection of the laws of that state” such that an “obliga­\ntio[n] arise[s]” to respond there to suit); J. McIntyre Ma-\nchinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5) (same principle for general\njurisdiction). The majority’s focus on the extent of a corpo­\nrate defendant’s out-of-forum contacts is untethered from\nthis rationale. After all, the degree to which a company\nintentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its\ninteractions with that State, not its interactions else­\nwhere. An article on which the majority relies (and on\nwhich Goodyear relied as well, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7)) expresses the point well: “We should not treat de­\nfendants as less amenable to suit merely because they\ncarry on more substantial business in other states . . . .\n[T]he amount of activity elsewhere seems virtually irrele­\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Rev. 721, 742 (1988).\n   Had the majority applied our settled approach, it would\nhave had little trouble concluding that Daimler’s Califor­\nnia contacts rise to the requisite level, given the majority’s\nassumption that MBUSA’s contacts may be attributed to\nDaimler and given Daimler’s concession that those con­\ntacts render MBUSA “at home” in California. Our cases\nhave long stated the rule that a defendant’s contacts with\na forum State must be continuous, substantial, and sys­\ntematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that\nState’s general jurisdiction. See Perkins, 342 U. S., at 446.\nWe offered additional guidance in Goodyear, adding the\nphrase “essentially at home” to our prior formulation of\nthe rule. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (a State may\nexercise general jurisdiction where a defendant’s “affilia­\ntions with the State are so ‘continuous and systematic’ as\nto render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum\nState”). We used the phrase “at home” to signify that in\norder for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general\njurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a\nforum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise\nthat actually is “at home” in the State. See Brilmayer,\nsupra, at 742.8\n——————\n  8 The majority views the phrase “at home” as serving a different\n\npurpose—that of requiring a comparison between a defendant’s in-state\nand out-of-state contacts. Ante, at 21, n. 20. That cannot be the correct\nunderstanding though, because among other things it would cast grave\ndoubt on Perkins—a case that Goodyear pointed to as an exemplar of\ngeneral jurisdiction, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). For if Perkins\nhad applied the majority’s newly minted proportionality test, it would\nhave come out the other way.\n  The majority apparently thinks that the Philippine corporate defend­\nant in Perkins did not have meaningful operations in places other than\nOhio. See ante, at 10–11, and n. 8. But one cannot get past the second\nsentence of Perkins before realizing that is wrong. That sentence reads:\n12                      DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Under this standard, Daimler’s concession that MBUSA\nis subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession\nthe Court accepts, ante, at 15, 17) should be dispositive.\nFor if MBUSA’s California contacts are so substantial and\nthe resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make\nMBUSA “at home” in California, the same must be true of\nDaimler when MBUSA’s contacts and benefits are viewed\nas its own. Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this\nCourt, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for\neight years of the litigation.\n                             B\n     The majority today concludes otherwise. Referring to\n——————\n“The corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a continuous and sys­\ntematic, but limited, part of its general business.” 342 U. S., at 438.\nIndeed, the facts of the case set forth by the Ohio Court of Appeals\nshow just how “limited” the company’s Ohio contacts—which included a\nsingle officer keeping files and managing affairs from his Ohio home\noffice—were in comparison with its “general business” operations\nelsewhere. By the time the suit was commenced, the company had\nresumed its considerable mining operations in the Philippines, “ ‘re­\nbuilding its properties’ ” there and purchasing “ ‘machinery, supplies\nand equipment.’ ” 88 Ohio App., at 123–124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. More­\nover, the company employed key managers in other forums, including a\npurchasing agent in San Francisco and a chief of staff in the Philip­\npines. Id., at 124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. The San Francisco purchasing\nagent negotiated the purchase of the company’s machinery and supplies\n“ ‘on the direction of the Company’s Chief of Staff in Manila,’ ” ibid., a\nfact that squarely refutes the majority’s assertion that “[a]ll of Ben­\nguet’s activities were directed by the company’s president from within\nOhio,” ante, at 11, n. 8. And the vast majority of the company’s board of\ndirectors meetings took place outside Ohio, in locations such as Wash­\nington, New York, and San Francisco. 88 Ohio App., at 125, 94 N. E.\n2d, at 8.\n    In light of these facts, it is all but impossible to reconcile the result in\nPerkins with the proportionality test the majority announces today.\nGoodyear’s use of the phrase “at home” is thus better understood to\nrequire the same general jurisdiction inquiry that Perkins required: An\nout-of-state business must have the kind of continuous and substantial\nin-state presence that a parallel local company would have.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nthe “continuous and systematic” contacts inquiry that has\nbeen taught to generations of first-year law students as\n“unacceptably grasping,” ante, at 19, the majority an­\nnounces the new rule that in order for a foreign defendant\nto be subject to general jurisdiction, it must not only pos­\nsess continuous and systematic contacts with a forum\nState, but those contacts must also surpass some unspeci­\nfied level when viewed in comparison to the company’s\n“nationwide and worldwide” activities. Ante, at 21, n. 20.9\n   Neither of the majority’s two rationales for this propor­\ntionality requirement is persuasive. First, the majority\nsuggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of\npredictability. Permitting general jurisdiction in every\nState where a corporation has continuous and substantial\ncontacts, the majority asserts, would “scarcely permit out­\nof-state defendants ‘to structure their primary conduct\nwith some minimum assurance as to where that conduct\nwill and will not render them liable to suit.’ ” Ante, at 21\n(quoting Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at 472). But there\nis nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multi­\nnational corporations that if they engage in continuous\nand substantial contacts with more than one State, they\nwill be subject to general jurisdiction in each one. The\nmajority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but\nsuch disagreement does not render an otherwise routine\n——————\n  9 I accept at face value the majority’s declaration that general juris­\n\ndiction is not limited to a corporation’s place of incorporation and\nprincipal place of business because “a corporation’s operations in a\nforum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the\ncorporation at home in the State.” Ante, at 20, n. 19; see also ante, at\n19. Were that not so, our analysis of the defendants’ in-state contacts\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408 (1984), and\nGoodyear would have been irrelevant, as none of the defendants in\nthose cases was sued in its place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness.\n14                DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntest unpredictable.\n   Nor is the majority’s proportionality inquiry any more\npredictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the\nmajority’s approach injects an additional layer of uncer­\ntainty because a corporate defendant must now try to\nforetell a court’s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its\ncontacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative\nsufficiency of those contacts in light of the company’s\noperations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not\neven try to explain just how extensive the company’s\nin-state contacts must be in the context of its global oper-\nations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.\n   The majority’s approach will also lead to greater unpre­\ndictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdic­\ntional discovery. Rather than ascertaining the extent of a\ncorporate defendant’s forum-state contacts alone, courts\nwill now have to identify the extent of a company’s con­\ntacts in every other forum where it does business in order\nto compare them against the company’s in-state contacts.\nThat considerable burden runs headlong into the major-\nity’s recitation of the familiar principle that “ ‘[s]imple\njurisdictional rules . . . promote greater predictability.’ ”\nAnte, at 18–19 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S.\n77, 94 (2010)).\n   Absent the predictability rationale, the majority’s sole\nremaining justification for its proportionality approach is\nits unadorned concern for the consequences. “If Daimler’s\nCalifornia activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this\nArgentina-rooted case in California,” the majority la­\nments, “the same global reach would presumably be avail­\nable in every other State in which MBUSA’s sales are\nsizable.” Ante, at 20.\n   The majority characterizes this result as “exorbitant,”\nibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the\nrule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that\nthere are “instances in which [a company’s] continuous\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncorporate operations within a state” are “so substantial\nand of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes\nof action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those\nactivities,” International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 318. In the\nera of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to\nhave such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be\nsubject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.\nToday, that circumstance is less rare. But that is as it\nshould be. What has changed since International Shoe is\nnot the due process principle of fundamental fairness but\nrather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was\nfair to say in the 1940’s that an out-of-state company could\nenjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it\n“essentially at home” in the State, it is fair to say today that\na multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive\nbenefits in multiple forum States that it is “essentially\nat home” in each one.\n   In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned\nwith the modern-day consequences of International Shoe’s\nconception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other\njudicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting un­\nfairness to large corporate defendants. Here, for instance,\nthe reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief. See\nsupra, at 3–4. In other cases, a defendant can assert the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a\nhighly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute. See Gulf\nOil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 508–509 (1947). In still\nother cases, the federal change of venue statute can pro­\nvide protection. See 28 U. S. C. §1404(a) (permitting\ntransfers to other districts “[f]or the convenience of parties\nand witnesses” and “in the interests of justice”). And to\nthe degree that the majority worries these doctrines are\nnot enough to protect the economic interests of multina­\ntional businesses (or that our longstanding approach to\ngeneral jurisdiction poses “risks to international comity,”\nante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns\n16                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbelongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state\nand federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the\ndemocratic process. Unfortunately, the majority short\ncircuits that process by enshrining today’s narrow rule of\ngeneral jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.\n                             C\n   The majority’s concern for the consequences of its deci­\nsion should have led it the other way, because the rule\nthat it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four\nrespects.\n   First, the majority’s approach unduly curtails the\nStates’ sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against\ncorporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and\nsubstantial business operations within their boundaries.10\nThe majority does not dispute that a State can exercise\ngeneral jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its\ncorporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of\nbusiness within the State. Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U. S., at\n93. Yet it never explains why the State should lose that\npower when, as is increasingly common, a corporation\n“divide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among\nofficers who work at several different locations.” Id., at\n95–96. Suppose a company divides its management func­\ntions equally among three offices in different States, with\none office nominally deemed the company’s corporate\nheadquarters. If the State where the headquarters is\nlocated can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the\n\n——————\n  10 States  will of course continue to exercise specific jurisdiction in\nmany cases, but we have never held that to be the outer limit of the\nStates’ authority under the Due Process Clause. That is because the\ntwo forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific\njurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant’s chal­\nlenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the\ndefendant’s substantial presence in the State irrespective of the loca­\ntion of the challenged conduct.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nother two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the\nsame? Indeed, under the majority’s approach, the result\nwould be unchanged even if the company has substantial\noperations within the latter two States (and even if the\ncompany has no sales or other business operations in the\nfirst State). Put simply, the majority’s rule defines the\nDue Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to\ncontravene the States’ sovereign prerogative to subject to\njudgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified\n“intention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit\nto the[ir] laws,” J. McIntyre, 564 U. S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5).\n   Second, the proportionality approach will treat small\nbusinesses unfairly in comparison to national and multi­\nnational conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will\noften be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on\naccount of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small\nbusiness will not be. For instance, the majority holds\ntoday that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in\nCalifornia despite its multiple offices, continuous opera­\ntions, and billions of dollars’ worth of sales there. But\nimagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehi­\ncles principally targeting the California market and that\nhas substantially all of its sales and operations in the\nState—even though those sales and operations may\namount to one-thousandth of Daimler’s. Under the major­\nity’s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in\nCalifornia on any cause of action involving any of its activ­\nities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive\ncompetitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if\nthe small business incorporates and sets up its headquar­\nters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business’\nCalifornia sales and operations would still predominate\nwhen “apprais[ed]” in proportion to its minimal “nation­\nwide and worldwide” operations, ante, at 21, n. 20.\n   Third, the majority’s approach creates the incongruous\n18                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nresult that an individual defendant whose only contact\nwith a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction if served with process during that\nvisit, Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n495 U. S. 604 (1990), but a large corporation that owns\nproperty, employs workers, and does billions of dollars’\nworth of business in the State will not be, simply because\nthe corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the\nvisiting individual surely does as well).\n   Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of\nthe majority’s approach will be to shift the risk of loss\nfrom multinational corporations to the individuals harmed\nby their actions. Under the majority’s rule, for example, a\nparent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a\nforeign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will\nbe unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U. S.\ncourt, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in\nmultiple States. See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int’l Hotels, Ltd.,\n288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).11 Similarly, a U. S. business\nthat enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its\nproducts to a multinational company there may be unable\nto seek relief in any U. S. court if the multinational com­\npany breaches the contract, even if that company has\nconsiderable operations in numerous U. S. forums. See,\ne.g., Walpex Trading Co. v. Yacimientos Petroliferos\nFiscales Bolivianos, 712 F. Supp. 383 (SDNY 1989).12\n——————\n  11 See  also, e.g., Woods v. Nova Companies Belize Ltd., 739 So. 2d\n617, 620–621 (Fla. App. 1999) (estate of decedent killed in an overseas\nplane crash permitted to sue responsible Belizean corporate defendant\nin Florida courts, rather than Belizean courts, based on defendant’s\ncontinuous and systematic business contacts in Florida).\n   12 The present case and the examples posited involve foreign corpo­\n\nrate defendants, but the principle announced by the majority would\napply equally to preclude general jurisdiction over a U. S. company that\nis incorporated and has its principal place of business in another U. S.\nState. Under the majority’s rule, for example, a General Motors auto­\nworker who retires to Florida would be unable to sue GM in that State\n                     Cite as: 571 U.
