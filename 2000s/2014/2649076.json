BAUMAN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 11\u2013965.      Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided January 14, 2014\nPlaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who\n  filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant\n  DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public\n  stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.\n  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argenti-\n  na), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state se-\n  curity forces during Argentina\u2019s 1976\u20131983 \u201cDirty War\u201d to kidnap,\n  detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them,\n  plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those alle-\n  gations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and\n  the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California\n  and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicat-\n  ed on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\n  another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its\n  principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daim-\n  ler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the\n  United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the\n  action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plain-\n  tiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the\n  California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler\u2019s\n  motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court\u2019s judgment, the\n  Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the\n  California courts\u2019 all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d for\n  jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be an-\n  swerable to suit in that State.\nHeld: Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries alleged-\n ly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside\n the United States. Pp. 6\u201324.\n2                       DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) California\u2019s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal ju-\n    risdiction to the full extent permissible under the U. S. Constitution.\n    Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding com-\n    ports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule\n    Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 6.\n       (b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over\n    persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the fo-\n    rum. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. That rigidly territorial focus\n    eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by\n    the Court\u2019s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Wash-\n    ington, 326 U. S. 310. International Shoe presaged the recognition of\n    two personal jurisdiction categories: One category, today called \u201cspe-\n    cific jurisdiction,\u201d see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.\n    Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit\n    \u201carise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the fo-\n    rum,\u201d Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n    408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific,\n    case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as \u201cgeneral ju-\n    risdiction,\u201d exercisable when a foreign corporation\u2019s \u201ccontinuous cor-\n    porate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a na-\n    ture as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from\n    dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\u201d 326 U. S., at 318.\n       Since International Shoe, \u201cspecific jurisdiction has become the cen-\n    terpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.\u201d Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n    This Court\u2019s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.\n    See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, Helicopte-\n    ros, 466 U. S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. As is evident\n    from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdic-\n    tion has been cut loose from Pennoyer\u2019s sway, general jurisdiction has\n    not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qual-\n    ifies as at home in California, Daimler\u2019s affiliations with California\n    are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that\n    State\u2019s courts. Pp. 14\u201323.\n          (1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of\n    general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in this case can-\n    not be sustained. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency determination rested\n    primarily on its observation that MBUSA\u2019s services were \u201cimportant\u201d\n    to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler\u2019s hypothetical readiness to perform\n    those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if \u201cimportan[ce]\u201d in\n    this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign\n    corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever\n    they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would\n    sweep beyond even the \u201csprawling view of general jurisdiction\u201d re-\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2013)                       3\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  jected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___. Pp. 15\u201317.\n       (2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and\n  that MBUSA\u2019s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be\n  no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The\n  paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corpora-\n  tion\u2019s place of incorporation and principal place of business. Good-\n  year, 564 U. S., at ___. Plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning, however, would reach\n  well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general\n  jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation \u201cengages in a sub-\n  stantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\u201d Brief for\n  Respondents 16\u201317, and nn. 7\u20138. The words \u201ccontinuous and sys-\n  tematic,\u201d plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in\n  International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of spe-\n  cific jurisdiction would be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317. With\n  respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead\n  of \u201cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n  state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit . . . on\n  causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those ac-\n  tivities.\u201d Id., at 318. Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has\n  explained, is whether a foreign corporation\u2019s \u201caffiliations with the\n  State are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render [it] essentially\n  at home in the forum State.\u201d Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n     Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor\n  does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daim-\n  ler\u2019s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argen-\n  tina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presuma-\n  bly be available in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\n  sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general juris-\n  diction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to\n  conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA\u2019s contacts attributed to it,\n  was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims\n  by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred\n  or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 18\u201321.\n       (3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears atten-\n  tion. This Court\u2019s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs\u2019\n  Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See Ki-\n  obel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___, ___, and Mohamad\n  v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___. The Ninth Circuit, more-\n  over, paid little heed to the risks to international comity posed by its\n  expansive view of general jurisdiction.

BARBARA\n\n                   BAUMAN ET AL. \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [January 14, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   This case concerns the authority of a court in the United\nStates to entertain a claim brought by foreign plaintiffs\nagainst a foreign defendant based on events occurring\nentirely outside the United States. The litigation com-\nmenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents1\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California against DaimlerChrysler\nAktiengesellschaft (Daimler),2 a German public stock\ncompany, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures\nMercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.           The complaint\nalleged that during Argentina\u2019s 1976\u20131983 \u201cDirty War,\u201d\nDaimler\u2019s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argen-\ntina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security\nforces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 One plaintiff is a resident of Argentina and a citizen of Chile; all\n\nother plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Argentina.\n   2 Daimler was restructured in 2007 and is now known as Daimler AG.\n\nNo party contends that any postsuit corporate reorganization bears on\nour disposition of this case. This opinion refers to members of the\nDaimler corporate family by the names current at the time plaintiffs\nfiled suit.\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArgentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons\nclosely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged\nhuman-rights violations were sought from Daimler under\nthe laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.\nJurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the Cali-\nfornia contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\na subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with\nits principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA\ndistributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independ-\nent dealerships throughout the United States, including\nCalifornia.\n   The question presented is whether the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the Dis-\ntrict Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case, given the absence of any California connection\nto the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court\u2019s general or all-\npurpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place\nwhere Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against\nit, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For exam-\nple, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel affirmed, under the proffered\njurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle\noverturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passen-\nger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit\nin California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201329. Exercises of\npersonal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by\ndue process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory\nauthority.\n   In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between\ngeneral or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-\nlinked jurisdiction. As to the former, we held that a court\nmay assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation \u201cto hear\nany and all claims against [it]\u201d only when the corporation\u2019s\naffiliations with the State in which suit is brought are\nso constant and pervasive \u201cas to render [it] essentially at\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhome in the forum State.\u201d Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2). In-\nstructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not \u201cat\nhome\u201d in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries\nplaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina\u2019s conduct in Argentina.\n                              I\n  In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with\nArgentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, tor-\nture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the\nmilitary dictatorship in place there from 1976 through\n1983, a period known as Argentina\u2019s \u201cDirty War.\u201d Based\non those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the\nAlien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, as well as claims for wrongful death and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws\nof California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in\nthe complaint center on MB Argentina\u2019s plant in Gonzalez\nCatan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina\u2019s alleged col-\nlaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in Cali-\nfornia or anywhere else in the United States.\n  Plaintiffs\u2019 operative complaint names only one corporate\ndefendant: Daimler, the petitioner here. Plaintiffs seek to\nhold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina\u2019s alleged\nmalfeasance. Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft\n(public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz\nvehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in\nStuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina\nwas a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler\u2019s predecessor\nin interest.\n  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal\njurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted\ndeclarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the\npresence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively,\n4                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could\nbe founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a dis-\ntinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should\nbe treated as Daimler\u2019s agent for jurisdictional purposes.\n  MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Dela-\nware limited liability corporation.3 MBUSA serves as\nDaimler\u2019s exclusive importer and distributor in the United\nStates, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from\nDaimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and\nultimately distributing them to independent dealerships\nlocated throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA\u2019s prin-\ncipal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has\nmultiple California-based facilities, including a regional\noffice in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in\nCarson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the\nrecord developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of\nluxury vehicles to the California market. In particular,\nover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States\ntake place in California, and MBUSA\u2019s California sales\naccount for 2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales.\n  The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delin-\neated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets\nforth requirements for MBUSA\u2019s distribution of Mercedes-\nBenz vehicles in the United States. That agreement\nestablished MBUSA as an \u201cindependent contracto[r]\u201d\nthat \u201cbuy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] . . . as an independent\nbusiness for [its] own account.\u201d App. 179a. The agree-\nment \u201cdoes not make [MBUSA] . . . a general or special\nagent, partner, joint venturer or employee of\nDAIMLERCHRYSLER or any DaimlerChrysler Group\nCompany\u201d; MBUSA \u201cha[s] no authority to make binding\nobligations for or act on behalf of DAIMLERCHRYSLER\nor any DaimlerChrysler Group Company.\u201d Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 At times relevant to this suit, MBUSA was wholly owned by Daimler-\n\nChrysler North America Holding Corporation, a Daimler subsidiary.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After allowing jurisdictional discovery on plaintiffs\u2019\nagency allegations, the District Court granted Daimler\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Daimler\u2019s own affiliations with Cali-\nfornia, the court first determined, were insufficient to\nsupport the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the\ncorporation. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler AG, No. C\u201304\u2013\n00194 RMW (ND Cal., Nov. 22, 2005), App. to Pet. for\nCert. 111a\u2013112a, 2005 WL 3157472, *9\u2013*10. Next, the\ncourt declined to attribute MBUSA\u2019s California contacts to\nDaimler on an agency theory, concluding that plaintiffs\nfailed to demonstrate that MBUSA acted as Daimler\u2019s\nagent. Id., at 117a, 133a, 2005 WL 3157472, *12, *19;\nBauman v. DaimlerChrysler AG, No. C\u201304\u201300194 RMW\n(ND Cal., Feb. 12, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a\u201385a,\n2007 WL 486389, *2.\n  The Ninth Circuit at first affirmed the District Court\u2019s\njudgment. Addressing solely the question of agency, the\nCourt of Appeals held that plaintiffs had not shown the\nexistence of an agency relationship of the kind that might\nwarrant attribution of MBUSA\u2019s contacts to Daimler.\nBauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 579 F. 3d 1088, 1096\u2013\n1097 (2009). Judge Reinhardt dissented. In his view, the\nagency test was satisfied and considerations of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d did not bar the exercise of jurisdiction. Id., at\n1098\u20131106. Granting plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing, the\npanel withdrew its initial opinion and replaced it with one\nauthored by Judge Reinhardt, which elaborated on reason-\ning he initially expressed in dissent. Bauman v. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909 (CA9 2011).\n  Daimler petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nurging that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over\nDaimler could not be reconciled with this Court\u2019s decision\nin Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011). Over the dissent of eight judges, the\nNinth Circuit denied Daimler\u2019s petition. See Bauman v.\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 676 F. 3d 774 (2011) (O\u2019Scannlain,\n6                  DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nDaimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims\ninvolving only foreign plaintiffs and conduct occurring\nentirely abroad. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determin-\ning the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to\nestablish personal jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cwho is\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction\nin the state where the district court is located\u201d). Under\nCalifornia\u2019s long-arm statute, California state courts may\nexercise personal jurisdiction \u201con any basis not incon-\nsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United\nStates.\u201d Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7410.10 (West 2004).\nCalifornia\u2019s long-arm statute allows the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the\nU. S. Constitution. We therefore inquire whether the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s holding comports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 464 (1985).\n                               III\n   In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878), decided shortly\nafter the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\nCourt held that a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over persons\nreaches no farther than the geographic bounds of the\nforum.

In the proceedings\nbelow, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain\npoints we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never at-\ntempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction cate-\ngory. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District\nCourt\u2019s holding that Daimler\u2019s own contacts with Califor-\nnia were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exer-\ncise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately\npersuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA\u2019s Califor-\nnia contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point\nhave they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of\nDaimler.\n   Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to\nplaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the California courts could exer-\ncise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.12 But see Brief\nfor Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of Good-\nyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction\nin California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16, n. 5 (hereinafter U.

The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency\nanalysis derived from Circuit precedent considering\nprincipally whether the subsidiary \u201cperforms services that\nare sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if\nit did not have a representative to perform them, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 12 MBUSA   is not a defendant in this case.\n16                     DAIMLER AG v.

Daim-\nler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its\nparent only when the former is so dominated by the latter\nas to be its alter ego.

Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and\nshapes: \u201cOne may be an agent for some business purposes\nand not others so that the fact that one may be an agent\nfor one purpose does not make him or her an agent for\nevery purpose.\u201d 2A C. J. S., Agency \u00a743, p. 367 (2013)\n(footnote omitted).13 A subsidiary, for example, might be\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 Agency   relationships, we have recognized, may be relevant to the\nexistence of specific jurisdiction. \u201c[T]he corporate personality,\u201d Interna-\ntional Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), observed, \u201cis a\nfiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a\nfact.\u201d Id., at 316. See generally 1 W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of\nCorporations \u00a730, p. 30 (Supp. 2012\u20132013) (\u201cA corporation is a distinct\nlegal entity that can act only through its agents.\u201d). As such, a corpora-\ntion can purposefully avail itself of a forum by directing its agents or\ndistributors to take action there. See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U. S., at 112\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (defendant\u2019s act of \u201cmarketing [a] product\nthrough a distributor who has agreed to serve as the sales agent in the\nforum State\u201d may amount to purposeful availment); International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (\u201cthe commission of some single or occasional acts of\nthe corporate agent in a state\u201d may sometimes \u201cbe deemed sufficient to\nrender the corporation liable to suit\u201d on related claims). See also Brief\nfor Petitioner 24 (acknowledging that \u201can agency relationship may be\nsufficient in some circumstances to give rise to specific jurisdiction\u201d). It\ndoes not inevitably follow, however, that similar reasoning applies to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Cf. Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10)\n(faulting analysis that \u201celided the essential difference between case-\nspecific and all-purpose (general) jurisdiction\u201d).\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The Court of Appeals did not advert to\nthat prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invoca-\ntion of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdic-\ntion, for in no event can the appeals court\u2019s analysis be\nsustained.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency finding rested primarily on\nits observation that MBUSA\u2019s services were \u201cimportant\u201d to\nDaimler, as gauged by Daimler\u2019s hypothetical readiness to\nperform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.\nFormulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks\nthe deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer:\n\u201cAnything a corporation does through an independent\ncontractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably some-\nthing that the corporation would do \u2018by other means\u2019 if the\nindependent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not\nexist.\u201d 676 F. 3d, at 777 (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).14 The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency\ntheory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to\ngeneral jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state sub-\nsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond\neven the \u201csprawling view of general jurisdiction\u201d we re-\njected in Goodyear. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).15\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  14 Indeed, plaintiffs do not defend this aspect of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\n\nanalysis. See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 18 (\u201cWe do not believe that\nthis gloss is particularly helpful.\u201d).\n  15 The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency analysis also looked to whether the\n\nparent enjoys \u201cthe right to substantially control\u201d the subsidiary\u2019s\nactivities. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909, 924\n(2011). The Court of Appeals found the requisite \u201ccontrol\u201d demon-\nstrated by the General Distributor Agreement between Daimler and\nMBUSA, which gives Daimler the right to oversee certain of MBUSA\u2019s\noperations, even though that agreement expressly disavowed the\ncreation of any agency relationship. Thus grounded, the separate\ninquiry into control hardly curtails the overbreadth of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s agency holding.\n18                     DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n                              B\n   Even if we were to assume that MBUSA is at home in\nCalifornia, and further to assume MBUSA\u2019s contacts are\nimputable to Daimler, there would still be no basis to\nsubject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California, for\nDaimler\u2019s slim contacts with the State hardly render it at\nhome there.16\n   Goodyear made clear that only a limited set of affilia-\ntions with a forum will render a defendant amenable to\nall-purpose jurisdiction there. \u201cFor an individual, the\nparadigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is\nthe individual\u2019s domicile; for a corporation, it is an equiva-\nlent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded\nas at home.\u201d 564 U.

With respect to a corpora-\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  16 By addressing this point, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR asserts, we have\n\nstrayed from the question on which we granted certiorari to decide an\nissue not argued below. Post, at 5\u20136. That assertion is doubly flawed.\nFirst, the question on which we granted certiorari, as stated in Daim-\nler\u2019s petition, is \u201cwhether it violates due process for a court to exercise\ngeneral personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation based solely on\nthe fact that an indirect corporate subsidiary performs services on\nbehalf of the defendant in the forum State.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. That\nquestion fairly encompasses an inquiry into whether, in light of Good-\nyear, Daimler can be considered at home in California based on\nMBUSA\u2019s in-state activities. See also this Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a) (a\nparty\u2019s statement of the question presented \u201cis deemed to comprise\nevery subsidiary question fairly included therein\u201d). Moreover, both in\nthe Ninth Circuit, see, e.g., Brief for Federation of German Industries\net al. as Amici Curiae in No. 07\u201315386 (CA9), p. 3, and in this Court,\nsee, e.g., U. S.

In short, and in light of our pathmarking opinion in Good-\nyear, we perceive no unfairness in deciding today that California is not\nan all-purpose forum for claims against Daimler.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559\nU. S. 77, 94 (2010) (\u201cSimple jurisdictional rules . . . pro-\nmote greater predictability.\u201d). These bases afford plain-\ntiffs recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in\nwhich a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all\nclaims.\n   Goodyear did not hold that a corporation may be subject\nto general jurisdiction only in a forum where it is incor-\nporated or has its principal place of business; it simply\ntyped those places paradigm all-purpose forums. Plaintiffs\nwould have us look beyond the exemplar bases Goodyear\nidentified, and approve the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin every State in which a corporation \u201cengages in a sub-\nstantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 16\u201317, and nn. 7\u20138. That formula-\ntion, we hold, is unacceptably grasping.\n   As noted, see supra, at 7\u20138, the words \u201ccontinuous and\nsystematic\u201d were used in International Shoe to describe\ninstances in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction\nwould be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317 (jurisdiction\ncan be asserted where a corporation\u2019s in-state activities\nare not only \u201ccontinuous and systematic, but also give rise\nto the liabilities sued on\u201d).17 Turning to all-purpose juris-\ndiction, in contrast, International Shoe speaks of \u201cinstances\nin which the continuous corporate operations within a\nstate [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    17 International Shoe also recognized, as noted above, see supra, at 7\u20138,\n\nthat \u201csome single or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state\n. . . , because of their nature and quality and the circumstances of their\ncommission, may be deemed sufficient to render the corporation liable\nto suit.\u201d 326 U.

S. 100 (1898), and Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259,\n115 N. E. 915 (1917) (Cardozo, J.), both cited in Perkins v. Benguet\nConsol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), just after the statement that\na corporation\u2019s continuous operations in-state may suffice to establish\ngeneral jurisdiction. Id., at 446, and n. 6. See also International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (citing Tauza). Barrow and Tauza indeed upheld the\nexercise of general jurisdiction based on the presence of a local office,\nwhich signaled that the corporation was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the forum.\nPerkins\u2019 unadorned citations to these cases, both decided in the era\ndominated by Pennoyer\u2019s territorial thinking, see supra, at 6\u20137, should\nnot attract heavy reliance today.

But this case presents no\noccasion to explore that question, because Daimler\u2019s activities in\nCalifornia plainly do not approach that level. It is one thing to hold a\ncorporation answerable for operations in the forum State, see infra, at\n23, quite another to expose it to suit on claims having no connection\nwhatever to the forum State.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

If Daimler\u2019s California activities suf-\nficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in\nCalifornia, the same global reach would presumably be\navailable in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\nsizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdic-\ntion would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants \u201cto\nstructure their primary conduct with some minimum\nassurance as to where that conduct will and will not ren-\nder them liable to suit.\u201d Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at\n472 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude\nthat Daimler, even with MBUSA\u2019s contacts attributed to\nit, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit\nthere on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do\nwith anything that occurred or had its principal impact in\nCalifornia.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 To clarify in light of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s opinion concurring in the\n\njudgment, the general jurisdiction inquiry does not \u201cfocu[s] solely on the\nmagnitude of the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts.\u201d Post, at 8. General\njurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation\u2019s activities in\ntheir entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A corporation that operates\nin many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Other-\nwise, \u201cat home\u201d would be synonymous with \u201cdoing business\u201d tests\nframed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States. See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1142\u20131144. Nothing in International Shoe\nand its progeny suggests that \u201ca particular quantum of local activity\u201d\nshould give a State authority over a \u201cfar larger quantum of . . . activity\u201d\nhaving no connection to any in-state activity. Feder, supra, at 694.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reach the same result, but for a different\nreason. Rather than concluding that Daimler is not at home in Cali-\nfornia, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would hold that the exercise of general\njurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable \u201cin the unique circum-\nstances of this case.\u201d Post, at 1. In other words, she favors a resolution\nfit for this day and case only. True, a multipronged reasonableness\ncheck was articulated in Asahi, 480 U. S., at 113\u2013114, but not as a free-\nfloating test. Instead, the check was to be essayed when specific\njurisdiction is at issue. See also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\nU. S. 462, 476\u2013478 (1985). First, a court is to determine whether the\n22                     DAIMLER AG v.

The Court of Appeals emphasized, as support-\nive of the exercise of general jurisdiction, plaintiffs\u2019 asser-\ntion of claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of\n1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71350. See 644 F. 3d, at 927 (\u201cAmerican federal courts, be\nthey in California or any other state, have a strong inter-\nest in adjudicating and redressing international human\nrights abuses.\u201d). Recent decisions of this Court, however,\nhave rendered plaintiffs\u2019 ATS and TVPA claims infirm.\nSee Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (presumption against extra-\nterritorial application controls claims under the ATS);\nMohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconnection between the forum and the episode-in-suit could justify the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction. Then, in a second step, the court is to\nconsider several additional factors to assess the reasonableness of\nentertaining the case. When a corporation is genuinely at home in the\nforum State, however, any second-step inquiry would be superfluous.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR fears that our holding will \u201clead to greater un-\npredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional dis-\ncovery.\u201d Post, at 14. But it is hard to see why much in the way of\ndiscovery would be needed to determine where a corporation is at home.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s proposal to import Asahi\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d check\ninto the general jurisdiction determination, on the other hand, would\nindeed compound the jurisdictional inquiry. The reasonableness factors\nidentified in Asahi include \u201cthe burden on the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe interests\nof the forum State,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining relief,\u201d \u201cthe\ninterstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient\nresolution of controversies,\u201d \u201cthe shared interest of the several States in\nfurthering fundamental substantive social policies,\u201d and, in the inter-\nnational context, \u201cthe procedural and substantive policies of other\nnations whose interests are affected by the assertion of jurisdiction.\u201d\n480 U. S., at 113\u2013115 (some internal quotation marks omitted).

It has multiple facilities\nin the State, including a regional headquarters. Each\nyear, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars,\nthe sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year\nthis suit was brought. And it provides service and sales\nsupport to customers throughout the State. Daimler has\nconceded that California courts may exercise general\njurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts,\nand the Court assumes that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be\nattributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether\nDaimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.\n  Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that\nthey are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process\njurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that\nDaimler\u2019s contacts with California are too few, but that its\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncontacts with other forums are too many. In other words,\nthe Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple\noffices, the direct distribution of thousands of products\naccounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous\ninteraction with customers throughout a State would be\nenough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nsome businesses. Daimler is just not one of those busi\u00ad\nnesses, the Court concludes, because its California con\u00ad\ntacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive \u201cna\u00ad\ntionwide and worldwide\u201d operations. Ante, at 21, n. 20. In\nrecent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the\nconcept of multinational corporations that are supposedly\n\u201ctoo big to fail\u201d; today the Court deems Daimler \u201ctoo big for\ngeneral jurisdiction.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both\nprocess and substance. As to process, the Court decides\nthis case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed\non below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a\nfootnote to its brief.

As\nto substance, the Court\u2019s focus on Daimler\u2019s operations out\u00ad\nside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal\njurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defend\u00ad\nant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently\ntaken advantage of the State\u2019s laws and protections\nthrough its contacts in the State; whether the defendant\nhas contacts elsewhere is immaterial.\n   Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can\nand should decide this case on the far simpler ground that,\nno matter how extensive Daimler\u2019s contacts with Califor\u00ad\nnia, that State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would be unrea\u00ad\nsonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs\nsuing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and\ngiven that a more appropriate forum is available. Because\nI would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I\nconcur in the judgment only.\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                        3\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                              I\n   I begin with the point on which the majority and I agree:\nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed.\n   Our personal jurisdiction precedents call for a two-part\nanalysis. The contacts prong asks whether the defendant\nhas sufficient contacts with the forum State to support\npersonal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks\nwhether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable\nunder the circumstances. Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475\u2013478 (1985). As the majority\npoints out, all of the cases in which we have applied the\nreasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Ante, at 21, n. 20. Whether the\nreasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdic\u00ad\ntion context is therefore a question we have never decided,1\nand it is one on which I can appreciate the arguments on\nboth sides. But it would be imprudent to decide that\nquestion in this case given that respondents have failed to\nargue against the application of the reasonableness prong\nduring the entire 8-year history of this litigation. See\nBrief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that the reasonableness\n\nprong does in fact apply in the general jurisdiction context. See Metro-\npolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F. 3d 560, 573 (CA2\n1996) (\u201c[E]very circuit that has considered the question has held,\nimplicitly or explicitly, that the reasonableness inquiry is applicable to\nall questions of personal jurisdiction, general or specific\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nLakin v. Prudential Securities, Inc., 348 F. 3d 704, 713 (CA8 2003);\nBase Metal Trading, Ltd. v. OJSC \u201cNovokuznetsky Aluminum Factory,\u201d\n283 F. 3d 208, 213\u2013214 (CA4 2002); Trierwelier v. Croxton & Trench\nHolding Corp., 90 F. 3d 1523, 1533 (CA10 1996); Amoco Egypt Oil Co.\nv.

Without the\nbenefit of a single page of briefing on the issue, the majority casually\nadds each of these cases to the mounting list of decisions jettisoned as a\nconsequence of today\u2019s ruling. See ante, at 21, n. 20.\n4                     DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nof the reasonableness inquiry); Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to\nDefendant\u2019s Motion to Quash Service of Process and to\nDismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction in No. 04\u2013\n00194\u2013RMW (ND Cal., May 16, 2005), pp. 14\u201323 (same).\nAs a result, I would decide this case under the reasonable\u00ad\nness prong without foreclosing future consideration of\nwhether that prong should be limited to the specific juris\u00ad\ndiction context.2\n  We identified the factors that bear on reasonableness in\nAsahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano\nCty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987): \u201cthe burden on the defendant,\nthe interests of the forum State,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff \u2019s interest\nin obtaining relief \u201d in the forum State, and the interests of\nother sovereigns in resolving the dispute. Id., at 113\u2013114.\nWe held in Asahi that it would be \u201cunreasonable and\nunfair\u201d for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a\nclaim between a Taiwanese plaintiff and a Japanese de\u00ad\nfendant that arose out of a transaction in Taiwan, particu\u00ad\nlarly where the Taiwanese plaintiff had not shown that it\nwould be more convenient to litigate in California than in\nTaiwan or Japan. Id., at 114.\n  The same considerations resolve this case. It involves\nArgentine plaintiffs suing a German defendant for conduct\nthat took place in Argentina. Like the plaintiffs in Asahi,\nrespondents have failed to show that it would be more\nconvenient to litigate in California than in Germany, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 While\n          our decisions rejecting the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nhave typically done so under the minimum-contacts prong, we have\nnever required that prong to be decided first. See Asahi Metal Industry\nCo. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102, 121 (1987)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting\npersonal jurisdiction under the reasonableness prong and declining to\nconsider the minimum-contacts prong because doing so would not be\n\u201cnecessary\u201d). And although the majority frets that deciding this case on\nthe reasonableness ground would be \u201ca resolution fit for this day and\ncase only,\u201d ante, at 21, n. 20, I do not understand our constitutional\nduty to require otherwise.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   5\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nsovereign with a far greater interest in resolving the\ndispute. Asahi thus makes clear that it would be unrea\u00ad\nsonable for a court in California to subject Daimler to its\njurisdiction.\n                              II\n  The majority evidently agrees that, if the reasonable\u00ad\nness prong were to apply, it would be unreasonable for\nCalifornia courts to exercise jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case. See ante, at 20\u201321 (noting that it would be \u201cexor\u00ad\nbitant\u201d for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction\nover Daimler, a German defendant, in this \u201cArgentina\u00ad\nrooted case\u201d brought by \u201cforeign plaintiffs\u201d). But instead\nof resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the\nmajority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued\nnor decided below.3\n  We generally do not pass on arguments that lower\ncourts have not addressed. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). After all, \u201cwe are a court of\nreview, not of first view.\u201d Ibid. This principle carries even\ngreater force where the argument at issue was never\npressed below. See Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198,\n205 (2001). Yet the majority disregards this principle,\nbasing its decision on an argument raised for the first time\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority appears to suggest that Daimler may have presented\n\nthe argument in its petition for rehearing en banc before the Ninth\nCircuit. See ante, at 5 (stating that Daimler \u201curg[ed] that the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction . . . could not be reconciled with this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011)\u201d). But Daimler\u2019s petition for rehearing did not argue\nwhat the Court holds today. The Court holds that Daimler\u2019s Califor-\nnia contacts would be insufficient for general jurisdiction even assum\u00ad\ning that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be attributed to Daimler. Daimler\u2019s\nrehearing petition made a distinct argument\u2014that attribution of\nMBUSA\u2019s contacts should not be permitted under an \u201c \u2018agency\u2019 theory\u201d\nbecause doing so would \u201crais[e] significant constitutional concerns\u201d\nunder Goodyear.

BAUMAN\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nin a footnote of Daimler\u2019s merits brief before this Court.\nBrief for Petitioner 32, n. 5 (\u201cEven if MBUSA were a divi\u00ad\nsion of Daimler AG rather than a separate corporation,\nDaimler AG would still . . . not be \u2018at home\u2019 in California\u201d).\n  The majority\u2019s decision is troubling all the more because\nthe parties were not asked to brief this issue. We granted\ncertiorari on the question \u201cwhether it violates due process\nfor a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a\nforeign corporation based solely on the fact that an indi\u00ad\nrect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of\nthe defendant in the forum State.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. At no\npoint in Daimler\u2019s petition for certiorari did the company\ncontend that, even if this attribution question were de\u00ad\ncided against it, its contacts in California would still be in-\nsufficient to support general jurisdiction. The parties\u2019 merits\nbriefs accordingly focused on the attribution-of-contacts\nquestion, addressing the reasonableness inquiry (which\nhad been litigated and decided below) in most of the space\nthat remained. See Brief for Petitioner 17\u201337, 37\u201343;\nBrief for Respondents 18\u201347, 47\u201359.\n  In bypassing the question on which we granted certio\u00ad\nrari to decide an issue not litigated below, the Court leaves\nrespondents \u201cwithout an unclouded opportunity to air\nthe issue the Court today decides against them,\u201d Comcast\nCorp. v.

MBUSA imports\nmore than 200,000 vehicles into the United States and\ndistributes many of them to independent dealerships in\nCalifornia, where they are sold. Declaration of Dr. Peter\nWask\u00f6nig in Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., No. 04\u2013\n00194\u2013RMW (ND Cal.), \u00b6 10, p. 2. MBUSA\u2019s California\nsales account for 2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales, which\nwere $192 billion in 2004.4 And 2.4% of $192 billion is\n$4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure. MBUSA\nalso has multiple offices and facilities in California, in\u00ad\ncluding a regional headquarters.\n  But the record does not answer a number of other\nimportant questions. Are any of Daimler\u2019s key files main\u00ad\ntained in MBUSA\u2019s California offices? How many employ\u00ad\nees work in those offices? Do those employees make\nimportant strategic decisions or oversee in any manner\nDaimler\u2019s activities? These questions could well affect\nwhether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction. After\nall, this Court upheld the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437,\n447\u2013448 (1952)\u2014which the majority refers to as a \u201ctext\u00ad\nbook case\u201d of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10\u2014on the basis\nthat the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio,\nkept corporate files there, and oversaw the company\u2019s\nactivities from the State. California-based MBUSA em\u00ad\nployees may well have done similar things on Daimler\u2019s\nbehalf.5 But because the Court decides the issue without a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See DaimlerChrysler, Innovations for our Customers: Annual Report\n2004, p. 22, http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/\n1364377_2004_DaimlerChrysler_Annual_Report.pdf (as visited on Jan. 8,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n  5 To be sure, many of Daimler\u2019s key management decisions are un\u00ad\n\ndoubtedly made by employees outside California. But the same was\ntrue in Perkins. See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Min. Co., 88 Ohio App.\n118, 124, 95 N. E. 2d 5, 8 (1950) (per curiam) (describing management\n8                     DAIMLER AG v.

International Shoe Co. v.\nWashington, 326 U. S. 310, 318 (1945); see also Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408,\n416 (1984) (asking whether defendant had \u201ccontinuous\nand systematic general business contacts\u201d).6 In every case\nwhere we have applied this test, we have focused solely on\nthe magnitude of the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts, not the\nrelative magnitude of those contacts in comparison to the\ndefendant\u2019s contacts with other States.\n  In Perkins, for example, we found an Ohio court\u2019s exer\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ndecisions made by the company\u2019s chief of staff in Manila and a purchas\u00ad\ning agent in California); see also n. 8, infra.\n  6 While Helicopteros formulated the general jurisdiction inquiry as\n\nasking whether a foreign defendant possesses \u201ccontinuous and system\u00ad\natic general business contacts,\u201d 466 U. S., at 416, the majority correctly\nnotes, ante, at 19, that International Shoe used the phrase \u201ccontinuous\nand systematic\u201d in the context of discussing specific jurisdiction, 326\nU. S., at 317. But the majority recognizes that International Shoe\nseparately described the type of contacts needed for general jurisdiction\nas \u201ccontinuous corporate operations\u201d that are \u201cso substantial\u201d as to\njustify suit on unrelated causes of action. Id., at 318. It is unclear why\nour precedents departed from International Shoe\u2019s \u201ccontinuous and\nsubstantial\u201d formulation in favor of the \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d\nformulation, but the majority does not contend\u2014nor do I perceive\u2014that\nthere is a material difference between the two.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 447\u2013448. At no point did\nwe attempt to catalog the company\u2019s contacts in forums\nother than Ohio or to compare them with its Ohio con\u00ad\ntacts. If anything, we intimated that the defendant\u2019s Ohio\ncontacts were not substantial in comparison to its contacts\nelsewhere. See id., at 438 (noting that the defendant\u2019s\nOhio contacts, while \u201ccontinuous and systematic,\u201d were\nbut a \u201climited . . . part of its general business\u201d).7\n   We engaged in the same inquiry in Helicopteros. There,\nwe held that a Colombian corporation was not subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction in Texas simply because it occasion\u00ad\nally sent its employees into the State, accepted checks\ndrawn on a Texas bank, and purchased equipment and\nservices from a Texas company. In no sense did our anal\u00ad\nysis turn on the extent of the company\u2019s operations beyond\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The  majority suggests that I misinterpret language in Perkins that I\ndo not even cite. Ante, at 11, n. 8. The majority is quite correct that it\nhas found a sentence in Perkins that does not address whether most of\nthe Philippine corporation\u2019s activities took place outside of Ohio. See\nante, at 11, n. 8 (noting that Perkins described the company\u2019s \u201cwartime\nactivities\u201d as \u201cnecessarily limited,\u201d 342 U. S., at 448). That is why I did\nnot mention it. I instead rely on a sentence in Perkins\u2019 opening para\u00ad\ngraph: \u201cThe [Philippine] corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a\ncontinuous and systematic, but limited, part of its general business.\u201d\nId., at 438. That sentence obviously does convey that most of the\ncorporation\u2019s activities occurred in \u201cplaces other than Ohio,\u201d ante, at 11,\nn. 8. This is not surprising given that the company\u2019s Ohio contacts\ninvolved a single officer working from a home office, while its non-Ohio\ncontacts included significant mining properties and machinery operated\nthroughout the Philippines, Philippine employees (including a chief of\nstaff), a purchasing agent based in California, and board of directors\nmeetings held in Washington, New York, and San Francisco. Perkins,\n88 Ohio App., at 123\u2013124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8; see also n. 8, infra.\n10                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTexas.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), our analysis again\nfocused on the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts. Goodyear\ninvolved a suit against foreign tire manufacturers by\nNorth Carolina residents whose children had died in a bus\naccident in France. We held that North Carolina courts\ncould not exercise general jurisdiction over the foreign\ndefendants. Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our\nopinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants\u2019 con\u00ad\ntacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the\ndefendants\u2019 lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and\nbusiness operations within the State.\n   This approach follows from the touchstone principle of\ndue process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.\nWhen a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and\nprotections of a State in which it operates, the State ac\u00ad\nquires the authority to subject the company to suit in its\ncourts. See International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319 (\u201c[T]o the\nextent that a corporation exercises the privilege of con\u00ad\nducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and\nprotection of the laws of that state\u201d such that an \u201cobliga\u00ad\ntio[n] arise[s]\u201d to respond there to suit); J. McIntyre Ma-\nchinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5) (same principle for general\njurisdiction). The majority\u2019s focus on the extent of a corpo\u00ad\nrate defendant\u2019s out-of-forum contacts is untethered from\nthis rationale. After all, the degree to which a company\nintentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its\ninteractions with that State, not its interactions else\u00ad\nwhere. An article on which the majority relies (and on\nwhich Goodyear relied as well, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7)) expresses the point well: \u201cWe should not treat de\u00ad\nfendants as less amenable to suit merely because they\ncarry on more substantial business in other states . . . .\n[T]he amount of activity elsewhere seems virtually irrele\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Rev. 721, 742 (1988).\n   Had the majority applied our settled approach, it would\nhave had little trouble concluding that Daimler\u2019s Califor\u00ad\nnia contacts rise to the requisite level, given the majority\u2019s\nassumption that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be attributed to\nDaimler and given Daimler\u2019s concession that those con\u00ad\ntacts render MBUSA \u201cat home\u201d in California. Our cases\nhave long stated the rule that a defendant\u2019s contacts with\na forum State must be continuous, substantial, and sys\u00ad\ntematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that\nState\u2019s general jurisdiction. See Perkins, 342 U. S., at 446.\nWe offered additional guidance in Goodyear, adding the\nphrase \u201cessentially at home\u201d to our prior formulation of\nthe rule. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (a State may\nexercise general jurisdiction where a defendant\u2019s \u201caffilia\u00ad\ntions with the State are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as\nto render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum\nState\u201d). We used the phrase \u201cat home\u201d to signify that in\norder for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general\njurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a\nforum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise\nthat actually is \u201cat home\u201d in the State. See Brilmayer,\nsupra, at 742.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority views the phrase \u201cat home\u201d as serving a different\n\npurpose\u2014that of requiring a comparison between a defendant\u2019s in-state\nand out-of-state contacts. Ante, at 21, n. 20. That cannot be the correct\nunderstanding though, because among other things it would cast grave\ndoubt on Perkins\u2014a case that Goodyear pointed to as an exemplar of\ngeneral jurisdiction, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). For if Perkins\nhad applied the majority\u2019s newly minted proportionality test, it would\nhave come out the other way.\n  The majority apparently thinks that the Philippine corporate defend\u00ad\nant in Perkins did not have meaningful operations in places other than\nOhio. See ante, at 10\u201311, and n. 8. But one cannot get past the second\nsentence of Perkins before realizing that is wrong. That sentence reads:\n12                      DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Under this standard, Daimler\u2019s concession that MBUSA\nis subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession\nthe Court accepts, ante, at 15, 17) should be dispositive.\nFor if MBUSA\u2019s California contacts are so substantial and\nthe resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make\nMBUSA \u201cat home\u201d in California, the same must be true of\nDaimler when MBUSA\u2019s contacts and benefits are viewed\nas its own. Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this\nCourt, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for\neight years of the litigation.\n                             B\n     The majority today concludes otherwise. Referring to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cThe corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a continuous and sys\u00ad\ntematic, but limited, part of its general business.\u201d 342 U. S., at 438.\nIndeed, the facts of the case set forth by the Ohio Court of Appeals\nshow just how \u201climited\u201d the company\u2019s Ohio contacts\u2014which included a\nsingle officer keeping files and managing affairs from his Ohio home\noffice\u2014were in comparison with its \u201cgeneral business\u201d operations\nelsewhere. By the time the suit was commenced, the company had\nresumed its considerable mining operations in the Philippines, \u201c \u2018re\u00ad\nbuilding its properties\u2019 \u201d there and purchasing \u201c \u2018machinery, supplies\nand equipment.\u2019 \u201d 88 Ohio App., at 123\u2013124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. More\u00ad\nover, the company employed key managers in other forums, including a\npurchasing agent in San Francisco and a chief of staff in the Philip\u00ad\npines. Id., at 124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8. The San Francisco purchasing\nagent negotiated the purchase of the company\u2019s machinery and supplies\n\u201c \u2018on the direction of the Company\u2019s Chief of Staff in Manila,\u2019 \u201d ibid., a\nfact that squarely refutes the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a]ll of Ben\u00ad\nguet\u2019s activities were directed by the company\u2019s president from within\nOhio,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 8. And the vast majority of the company\u2019s board of\ndirectors meetings took place outside Ohio, in locations such as Wash\u00ad\nington, New York, and San Francisco. 88 Ohio App., at 125, 94 N. E.\n2d, at 8.\n    In light of these facts, it is all but impossible to reconcile the result in\nPerkins with the proportionality test the majority announces today.\nGoodyear\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cat home\u201d is thus better understood to\nrequire the same general jurisdiction inquiry that Perkins required: An\nout-of-state business must have the kind of continuous and substantial\nin-state presence that a parallel local company would have.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Ante, at 21, n. 20.9\n   Neither of the majority\u2019s two rationales for this propor\u00ad\ntionality requirement is persuasive. First, the majority\nsuggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of\npredictability. Permitting general jurisdiction in every\nState where a corporation has continuous and substantial\ncontacts, the majority asserts, would \u201cscarcely permit out\u00ad\nof-state defendants \u2018to structure their primary conduct\nwith some minimum assurance as to where that conduct\nwill and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 21\n(quoting Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at 472). But there\nis nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multi\u00ad\nnational corporations that if they engage in continuous\nand substantial contacts with more than one State, they\nwill be subject to general jurisdiction in each one. The\nmajority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but\nsuch disagreement does not render an otherwise routine\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 I accept at face value the majority\u2019s declaration that general juris\u00ad\n\ndiction is not limited to a corporation\u2019s place of incorporation and\nprincipal place of business because \u201ca corporation\u2019s operations in a\nforum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the\ncorporation at home in the State.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 19; see also ante, at\n19. Were that not so, our analysis of the defendants\u2019 in-state contacts\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408 (1984), and\nGoodyear would have been irrelevant, as none of the defendants in\nthose cases was sued in its place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness.\n14                DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntest unpredictable.\n   Nor is the majority\u2019s proportionality inquiry any more\npredictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the\nmajority\u2019s approach injects an additional layer of uncer\u00ad\ntainty because a corporate defendant must now try to\nforetell a court\u2019s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its\ncontacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative\nsufficiency of those contacts in light of the company\u2019s\noperations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not\neven try to explain just how extensive the company\u2019s\nin-state contacts must be in the context of its global oper-\nations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.\n   The majority\u2019s approach will also lead to greater unpre\u00ad\ndictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdic\u00ad\ntional discovery. Rather than ascertaining the extent of a\ncorporate defendant\u2019s forum-state contacts alone, courts\nwill now have to identify the extent of a company\u2019s con\u00ad\ntacts in every other forum where it does business in order\nto compare them against the company\u2019s in-state contacts.\nThat considerable burden runs headlong into the major-\nity\u2019s recitation of the familiar principle that \u201c \u2018[s]imple\njurisdictional rules . . . promote greater predictability.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 18\u201319 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S.\n77, 94 (2010)).\n   Absent the predictability rationale, the majority\u2019s sole\nremaining justification for its proportionality approach is\nits unadorned concern for the consequences. \u201cIf Daimler\u2019s\nCalifornia activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this\nArgentina-rooted case in California,\u201d the majority la\u00ad\nments, \u201cthe same global reach would presumably be avail\u00ad\nable in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\nsizable.\u201d Ante, at 20.\n   The majority characterizes this result as \u201cexorbitant,\u201d\nibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the\nrule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that\nthere are \u201cinstances in which [a company\u2019s] continuous\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncorporate operations within a state\u201d are \u201cso substantial\nand of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes\nof action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those\nactivities,\u201d International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 318. In the\nera of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to\nhave such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be\nsubject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.\nToday, that circumstance is less rare. But that is as it\nshould be. What has changed since International Shoe is\nnot the due process principle of fundamental fairness but\nrather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was\nfair to say in the 1940\u2019s that an out-of-state company could\nenjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it\n\u201cessentially at home\u201d in the State, it is fair to say today that\na multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive\nbenefits in multiple forum States that it is \u201cessentially\nat home\u201d in each one.\n   In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned\nwith the modern-day consequences of International Shoe\u2019s\nconception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other\njudicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting un\u00ad\nfairness to large corporate defendants. Here, for instance,\nthe reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief. See\nsupra, at 3\u20134. In other cases, a defendant can assert the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a\nhighly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute. See Gulf\nOil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 508\u2013509 (1947). In still\nother cases, the federal change of venue statute can pro\u00ad\nvide protection. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71404(a) (permitting\ntransfers to other districts \u201c[f]or the convenience of parties\nand witnesses\u201d and \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d). And to\nthe degree that the majority worries these doctrines are\nnot enough to protect the economic interests of multina\u00ad\ntional businesses (or that our longstanding approach to\ngeneral jurisdiction poses \u201crisks to international comity,\u201d\nante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns\n16                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbelongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state\nand federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the\ndemocratic process. Unfortunately, the majority short\ncircuits that process by enshrining today\u2019s narrow rule of\ngeneral jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.\n                             C\n   The majority\u2019s concern for the consequences of its deci\u00ad\nsion should have led it the other way, because the rule\nthat it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four\nrespects.\n   First, the majority\u2019s approach unduly curtails the\nStates\u2019 sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against\ncorporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and\nsubstantial business operations within their boundaries.10\nThe majority does not dispute that a State can exercise\ngeneral jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its\ncorporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of\nbusiness within the State. Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U. S., at\n93. Yet it never explains why the State should lose that\npower when, as is increasingly common, a corporation\n\u201cdivide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among\nofficers who work at several different locations.\u201d Id., at\n95\u201396. Suppose a company divides its management func\u00ad\ntions equally among three offices in different States, with\none office nominally deemed the company\u2019s corporate\nheadquarters. If the State where the headquarters is\nlocated can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 States  will of course continue to exercise specific jurisdiction in\nmany cases, but we have never held that to be the outer limit of the\nStates\u2019 authority under the Due Process Clause. That is because the\ntwo forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific\njurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant\u2019s chal\u00ad\nlenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the\ndefendant\u2019s substantial presence in the State irrespective of the loca\u00ad\ntion of the challenged conduct.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nother two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the\nsame? Indeed, under the majority\u2019s approach, the result\nwould be unchanged even if the company has substantial\noperations within the latter two States (and even if the\ncompany has no sales or other business operations in the\nfirst State). Put simply, the majority\u2019s rule defines the\nDue Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to\ncontravene the States\u2019 sovereign prerogative to subject to\njudgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified\n\u201cintention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit\nto the[ir] laws,\u201d J. McIntyre, 564 U. S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5).\n   Second, the proportionality approach will treat small\nbusinesses unfairly in comparison to national and multi\u00ad\nnational conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will\noften be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on\naccount of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small\nbusiness will not be. For instance, the majority holds\ntoday that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in\nCalifornia despite its multiple offices, continuous opera\u00ad\ntions, and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of sales there. But\nimagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehi\u00ad\ncles principally targeting the California market and that\nhas substantially all of its sales and operations in the\nState\u2014even though those sales and operations may\namount to one-thousandth of Daimler\u2019s. Under the major\u00ad\nity\u2019s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in\nCalifornia on any cause of action involving any of its activ\u00ad\nities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive\ncompetitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if\nthe small business incorporates and sets up its headquar\u00ad\nters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business\u2019\nCalifornia sales and operations would still predominate\nwhen \u201capprais[ed]\u201d in proportion to its minimal \u201cnation\u00ad\nwide and worldwide\u201d operations, ante, at 21, n. 20.\n   Third, the majority\u2019s approach creates the incongruous\n18                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nresult that an individual defendant whose only contact\nwith a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction if served with process during that\nvisit, Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n495 U. S. 604 (1990), but a large corporation that owns\nproperty, employs workers, and does billions of dollars\u2019\nworth of business in the State will not be, simply because\nthe corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the\nvisiting individual surely does as well).\n   Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of\nthe majority\u2019s approach will be to shift the risk of loss\nfrom multinational corporations to the individuals harmed\nby their actions. Under the majority\u2019s rule, for example, a\nparent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a\nforeign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will\nbe unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U. S.\ncourt, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in\nmultiple States. See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int\u2019l Hotels, Ltd.,\n288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).11 Similarly, a U. S. business\nthat enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its\nproducts to a multinational company there may be unable\nto seek relief in any U. S. court if the multinational com\u00ad\npany breaches the contract, even if that company has\nconsiderable operations in numerous U. S. forums. See,\ne.g., Walpex Trading Co. v. Yacimientos Petroliferos\nFiscales Bolivianos, 712 F. Supp. 383 (SDNY 1989).12\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  11 See  also, e.g., Woods v.

App. 1999) (estate of decedent killed in an overseas\nplane crash permitted to sue responsible Belizean corporate defendant\nin Florida courts, rather than Belizean courts, based on defendant\u2019s\ncontinuous and systematic business contacts in Florida).\n   12 The present case and the examples posited involve foreign corpo\u00ad\n\nrate defendants, but the principle announced by the majority would\napply equally to preclude general jurisdiction over a U. S. company that\nis incorporated and has its principal place of business in another U. S.\nState. Under the majority\u2019s rule, for example, a General Motors auto\u00ad\nworker who retires to Florida would be unable to sue GM in that State\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

I cannot agree with the major-\nity\u2019s conclusion that the Due Process Clause requires these\nresults.\n                           * * *\n  The Court rules against respondents today on a ground\nthat no court has considered in the history of this case,\nthat this Court did not grant certiorari to decide, and that\nDaimler raised only in a footnote of its brief. In doing so,\nthe Court adopts a new rule of constitutional law that is\nunmoored from decades of precedent.

Argued October 15, 2013\u2014Decided January 14, 2014\nPlaintiffs (respondents here) are twenty-two residents of Argentina who\n  filed suit in California Federal District Court, naming as a defendant\n  DaimlerChrysler Aktiengesellschaft (Daimler), a German public\n  stock company that is the predecessor to petitioner Daimler AG.\n  Their complaint alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina (MB Argenti-\n  na), an Argentinian subsidiary of Daimler, collaborated with state se-\n  curity forces during Argentina\u2019s 1976\u20131983 \u201cDirty War\u201d to kidnap,\n  detain, torture, and kill certain MB Argentina workers, among them,\n  plaintiffs or persons closely related to plaintiffs. Based on those alle-\n  gations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the Alien Tort Statute and\n  the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, as well as under California\n  and Argentina law. Personal jurisdiction over Daimler was predicat-\n  ed on the California contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\n  another Daimler subsidiary, one incorporated in Delaware with its\n  principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA distributes Daim-\n  ler-manufactured vehicles to independent dealerships throughout the\n  United States, including California. Daimler moved to dismiss the\n  action for want of personal jurisdiction. Opposing that motion, plain-\n  tiffs argued that jurisdiction over Daimler could be founded on the\n  California contacts of MBUSA. The District Court granted Daimler\u2019s\n  motion to dismiss. Reversing the District Court\u2019s judgment, the\n  Ninth Circuit held that MBUSA, which it assumed to fall within the\n  California courts\u2019 all-purpose jurisdiction, was Daimler\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d for\n  jurisdictional purposes, so that Daimler, too, should generally be an-\n  swerable to suit in that State.\nHeld: Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries alleged-\n ly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside\n the United States.

BAUMAN\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n       (a) California\u2019s long-arm statute allows the exercise of personal ju-\n    risdiction to the full extent permissible under the U. S. Constitution.\n    Thus, the inquiry here is whether the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding com-\n    ports with the limits imposed by federal due process. See Fed. Rule\n    Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A). P. 6.\n       (b) For a time, this Court held that a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over\n    persons was necessarily limited by the geographic bounds of the fo-\n    rum. See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. That rigidly territorial focus\n    eventually yielded to a less wooden understanding, exemplified by\n    the Court\u2019s pathmarking decision in International Shoe Co. v. Wash-\n    ington, 326 U. S. 310. International Shoe presaged the recognition of\n    two personal jurisdiction categories: One category, today called \u201cspe-\n    cific jurisdiction,\u201d see Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.\n    Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___, encompasses cases in which the suit\n    \u201carise[s] out of or relate[s] to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the fo-\n    rum,\u201d Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S.\n    408, 414, n. 8. International Shoe distinguished exercises of specific,\n    case-based jurisdiction from a category today known as \u201cgeneral ju-\n    risdiction,\u201d exercisable when a foreign corporation\u2019s \u201ccontinuous cor-\n    porate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a na-\n    ture as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from\n    dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\u201d 326 U. S., at 318.\n       Since International Shoe, \u201cspecific jurisdiction has become the cen-\n    terpiece of modern jurisdiction theory.\u201d Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n    This Court\u2019s general jurisdiction opinions, in contrast, have been few.\n    See Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437, Helicopte-\n    ros, 466 U. S., at 416, and Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___. As is evident\n    from these post-International Shoe decisions, while specific jurisdic-\n    tion has been cut loose from Pennoyer\u2019s sway, general jurisdiction has\n    not been stretched beyond limits traditionally recognized. Pp. 6\u201314.\n       (c) Even assuming, for purposes of this decision, that MBUSA qual-\n    ifies as at home in California, Daimler\u2019s affiliations with California\n    are not sufficient to subject it to the general jurisdiction of that\n    State\u2019s courts. Pp. 14\u201323.\n          (1) Whatever role agency theory might play in the context of\n    general jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis in this case can-\n    not be sustained. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency determination rested\n    primarily on its observation that MBUSA\u2019s services were \u201cimportant\u201d\n    to Daimler, as gauged by Daimler\u2019s hypothetical readiness to perform\n    those services itself if MBUSA did not exist. But if \u201cimportan[ce]\u201d in\n    this sense were sufficient to justify jurisdictional attribution, foreign\n    corporations would be amenable to suit on any or all claims wherever\n    they have an in-state subsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would\n    sweep beyond even the \u201csprawling view of general jurisdiction\u201d re-\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

Pp. 15\u201317.\n       (2) Even assuming that MBUSA is at home in California and\n  that MBUSA\u2019s contacts are imputable to Daimler, there would still be\n  no basis to subject Daimler to general jurisdiction in California. The\n  paradigm all-purpose forums for general jurisdiction are a corpora-\n  tion\u2019s place of incorporation and principal place of business. Good-\n  year, 564 U. S., at ___. Plaintiffs\u2019 reasoning, however, would reach\n  well beyond these exemplar bases to approve the exercise of general\n  jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation \u201cengages in a sub-\n  stantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\u201d Brief for\n  Respondents 16\u201317, and nn. 7\u20138. The words \u201ccontinuous and sys-\n  tematic,\u201d plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals overlooked, were used in\n  International Shoe to describe situations in which the exercise of spe-\n  cific jurisdiction would be appropriate. See 326 U. S., at 317. With\n  respect to all-purpose jurisdiction, International Shoe spoke instead\n  of \u201cinstances in which the continuous corporate operations within a\n  state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit . . . on\n  causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those ac-\n  tivities.\u201d Id., at 318. Accordingly, the proper inquiry, this Court has\n  explained, is whether a foreign corporation\u2019s \u201caffiliations with the\n  State are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render [it] essentially\n  at home in the forum State.\u201d Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___.\n     Neither Daimler nor MBUSA is incorporated in California, nor\n  does either entity have its principal place of business there. If Daim-\n  ler\u2019s California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argen-\n  tina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presuma-\n  bly be available in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\n  sizable. No decision of this Court sanctions a view of general juris-\n  diction so grasping. The Ninth Circuit, therefore, had no warrant to\n  conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA\u2019s contacts attributed to it,\n  was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims\n  by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred\n  or had its principal impact in California. Pp. 18\u201321.\n       (3) Finally, the transnational context of this dispute bears atten-\n  tion. This Court\u2019s recent precedents have rendered infirm plaintiffs\u2019\n  Alien Tort Statute and Torture Victim Protection Act claims. See Ki-\n  obel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.

The litigation com-\nmenced in 2004, when twenty-two Argentinian residents1\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California against DaimlerChrysler\nAktiengesellschaft (Daimler),2 a German public stock\ncompany, headquartered in Stuttgart, that manufactures\nMercedes-Benz vehicles in Germany.           The complaint\nalleged that during Argentina\u2019s 1976\u20131983 \u201cDirty War,\u201d\nDaimler\u2019s Argentinian subsidiary, Mercedes-Benz Argen-\ntina (MB Argentina) collaborated with state security\nforces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill certain MB\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 One plaintiff is a resident of Argentina and a citizen of Chile; all\n\nother plaintiffs are residents and citizens of Argentina.\n   2 Daimler was restructured in 2007 and is now known as Daimler AG.\n\nNo party contends that any postsuit corporate reorganization bears on\nour disposition of this case. This opinion refers to members of the\nDaimler corporate family by the names current at the time plaintiffs\nfiled suit.\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nArgentina workers, among them, plaintiffs or persons\nclosely related to plaintiffs. Damages for the alleged\nhuman-rights violations were sought from Daimler under\nthe laws of the United States, California, and Argentina.\nJurisdiction over the lawsuit was predicated on the Cali-\nfornia contacts of Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA),\na subsidiary of Daimler incorporated in Delaware with\nits principal place of business in New Jersey. MBUSA\ndistributes Daimler-manufactured vehicles to independ-\nent dealerships throughout the United States, including\nCalifornia.\n   The question presented is whether the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes the Dis-\ntrict Court from exercising jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case, given the absence of any California connection\nto the atrocities, perpetrators, or victims described in the\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs invoked the court\u2019s general or all-\npurpose jurisdiction. California, they urge, is a place\nwhere Daimler may be sued on any and all claims against\nit, wherever in the world the claims may arise. For exam-\nple, as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel affirmed, under the proffered\njurisdictional theory, if a Daimler-manufactured vehicle\noverturned in Poland, injuring a Polish driver and passen-\nger, the injured parties could maintain a design defect suit\nin California. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\u201329. Exercises of\npersonal jurisdiction so exorbitant, we hold, are barred by\ndue process constraints on the assertion of adjudicatory\nauthority.\n   In Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown,\n564 U. S. ___ (2011), we addressed the distinction between\ngeneral or all-purpose jurisdiction, and specific or conduct-\nlinked jurisdiction. As to the former, we held that a court\nmay assert jurisdiction over a foreign corporation \u201cto hear\nany and all claims against [it]\u201d only when the corporation\u2019s\naffiliations with the State in which suit is brought are\nso constant and pervasive \u201cas to render [it] essentially at\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In-\nstructed by Goodyear, we conclude Daimler is not \u201cat\nhome\u201d in California, and cannot be sued there for injuries\nplaintiffs attribute to MB Argentina\u2019s conduct in Argentina.\n                              I\n  In 2004, plaintiffs (respondents here) filed suit in the\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that MB Argentina collaborated with\nArgentinian state security forces to kidnap, detain, tor-\nture, and kill plaintiffs and their relatives during the\nmilitary dictatorship in place there from 1976 through\n1983, a period known as Argentina\u2019s \u201cDirty War.\u201d Based\non those allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims under the\nAlien Tort Statute, 28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Torture\nVictim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following\n28 U. S. C. \u00a71350, as well as claims for wrongful death and\nintentional infliction of emotional distress under the laws\nof California and Argentina. The incidents recounted in\nthe complaint center on MB Argentina\u2019s plant in Gonzalez\nCatan, Argentina; no part of MB Argentina\u2019s alleged col-\nlaboration with Argentinian authorities took place in Cali-\nfornia or anywhere else in the United States.\n  Plaintiffs\u2019 operative complaint names only one corporate\ndefendant: Daimler, the petitioner here. Plaintiffs seek to\nhold Daimler vicariously liable for MB Argentina\u2019s alleged\nmalfeasance. Daimler is a German Aktiengesellschaft\n(public stock company) that manufactures Mercedes-Benz\nvehicles in Germany and has its headquarters in\nStuttgart. At times relevant to this case, MB Argentina\nwas a subsidiary wholly owned by Daimler\u2019s predecessor\nin interest.\n  Daimler moved to dismiss the action for want of personal\njurisdiction. Opposing the motion, plaintiffs submitted\ndeclarations and exhibits purporting to demonstrate the\npresence of Daimler itself in California. Alternatively,\n4                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nplaintiffs maintained that jurisdiction over Daimler could\nbe founded on the California contacts of MBUSA, a dis-\ntinct corporate entity that, according to plaintiffs, should\nbe treated as Daimler\u2019s agent for jurisdictional purposes.\n  MBUSA, an indirect subsidiary of Daimler, is a Dela-\nware limited liability corporation.3 MBUSA serves as\nDaimler\u2019s exclusive importer and distributor in the United\nStates, purchasing Mercedes-Benz automobiles from\nDaimler in Germany, then importing those vehicles, and\nultimately distributing them to independent dealerships\nlocated throughout the Nation. Although MBUSA\u2019s prin-\ncipal place of business is in New Jersey, MBUSA has\nmultiple California-based facilities, including a regional\noffice in Costa Mesa, a Vehicle Preparation Center in\nCarson, and a Classic Center in Irvine. According to the\nrecord developed below, MBUSA is the largest supplier of\nluxury vehicles to the California market. In particular,\nover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the United States\ntake place in California, and MBUSA\u2019s California sales\naccount for 2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales.\n  The relationship between Daimler and MBUSA is delin-\neated in a General Distributor Agreement, which sets\nforth requirements for MBUSA\u2019s distribution of Mercedes-\nBenz vehicles in the United States. That agreement\nestablished MBUSA as an \u201cindependent contracto[r]\u201d\nthat \u201cbuy[s] and sell[s] [vehicles] . . . as an independent\nbusiness for [its] own account.\u201d App. 179a. The agree-\nment \u201cdoes not make [MBUSA] . . . a general or special\nagent, partner, joint venturer or employee of\nDAIMLERCHRYSLER or any DaimlerChrysler Group\nCompany\u201d; MBUSA \u201cha[s] no authority to make binding\nobligations for or act on behalf of DAIMLERCHRYSLER\nor any DaimlerChrysler Group Company.\u201d Ibid.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 3 At times relevant to this suit, MBUSA was wholly owned by Daimler-\n\nChrysler North America Holding Corporation, a Daimler subsidiary.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  After allowing jurisdictional discovery on plaintiffs\u2019\nagency allegations, the District Court granted Daimler\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Daimler\u2019s own affiliations with Cali-\nfornia, the court first determined, were insufficient to\nsupport the exercise of all-purpose jurisdiction over the\ncorporation. Bauman v.

Addressing solely the question of agency, the\nCourt of Appeals held that plaintiffs had not shown the\nexistence of an agency relationship of the kind that might\nwarrant attribution of MBUSA\u2019s contacts to Daimler.\nBauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 579 F. 3d 1088, 1096\u2013\n1097 (2009). Judge Reinhardt dissented. In his view, the\nagency test was satisfied and considerations of \u201creason-\nableness\u201d did not bar the exercise of jurisdiction. Id., at\n1098\u20131106. Granting plaintiffs\u2019 petition for rehearing, the\npanel withdrew its initial opinion and replaced it with one\nauthored by Judge Reinhardt, which elaborated on reason-\ning he initially expressed in dissent. Bauman v. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909 (CA9 2011).\n  Daimler petitioned for rehearing and rehearing en banc,\nurging that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over\nDaimler could not be reconciled with this Court\u2019s decision\nin Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564\nU. S. ___ (2011). Over the dissent of eight judges, the\nNinth Circuit denied Daimler\u2019s petition. See Bauman v.\nDaimlerChrysler Corp., 676 F. 3d 774 (2011) (O\u2019Scannlain,\n6                  DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nJ., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether, consistent with\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nDaimler is amenable to suit in California courts for claims\ninvolving only foreign plaintiffs and conduct occurring\nentirely abroad. 569 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                              II\n  Federal courts ordinarily follow state law in determin-\ning the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons. See Fed.\nRule Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A) (service of process is effective to\nestablish personal jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cwho is\nsubject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction\nin the state where the district court is located\u201d). Under\nCalifornia\u2019s long-arm statute, California state courts may\nexercise personal jurisdiction \u201con any basis not incon-\nsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United\nStates.\u201d Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7410.10 (West 2004).\nCalifornia\u2019s long-arm statute allows the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction to the full extent permissible under the\nU. S. Constitution. We therefore inquire whether the\nNinth Circuit\u2019s holding comports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 464 (1985).\n                               III\n   In Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714 (1878), decided shortly\nafter the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\nCourt held that a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over persons\nreaches no farther than the geographic bounds of the\nforum. See id., at 720 (\u201cThe authority of every tribunal is\nnecessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State\nin which it is established.\u201d). See also Shaffer v. Heitner,\n433 U.

Supe-\nrior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 617\n(1990) (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\n   \u201cThe canonical opinion in this area remains Interna-\ntional Shoe [Co. v. Washington], 326 U. S. 310 [(1945)], in\nwhich we held that a State may authorize its courts to\nexercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defend-\nant if the defendant has \u2018certain minimum contacts with\n[the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not\noffend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Goodyear, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quot-\ning International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316). Following\nInternational Shoe, \u201cthe relationship among the defend-\nant, the forum, and the litigation, rather than the mutually\nexclusive sovereignty of the States on which the rules of\nPennoyer rest, became the central concern of the inquiry\ninto personal jurisdiction.\u201d Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204.\n   International Shoe\u2019s conception of \u201cfair play and sub-\nstantial justice\u201d presaged the development of two catego-\nries of personal jurisdiction.

In the proceedings\nbelow, the parties agreed on, or failed to contest, certain\npoints we now take as given. Plaintiffs have never at-\ntempted to fit this case into the specific jurisdiction cate-\ngory. Nor did plaintiffs challenge on appeal the District\nCourt\u2019s holding that Daimler\u2019s own contacts with Califor-\nnia were, by themselves, too sporadic to justify the exer-\ncise of general jurisdiction. While plaintiffs ultimately\npersuaded the Ninth Circuit to impute MBUSA\u2019s Califor-\nnia contacts to Daimler on an agency theory, at no point\nhave they maintained that MBUSA is an alter ego of\nDaimler.\n   Daimler, on the other hand, failed to object below to\nplaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the California courts could exer-\ncise all-purpose jurisdiction over MBUSA.12 But see Brief\nfor Petitioner 23, n. 4 (suggestion that in light of Good-\nyear, MBUSA may not be amenable to general jurisdiction\nin California); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\n16, n. 5 (hereinafter U.

We will assume\nthen, for purposes of this decision only, that MBUSA\nqualifies as at home in California.\n                             A\n  In sustaining the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nDaimler, the Ninth Circuit relied on an agency theory,\ndetermining that MBUSA acted as Daimler\u2019s agent for\njurisdictional purposes and then attributing MBUSA\u2019s\nCalifornia contacts to Daimler. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency\nanalysis derived from Circuit precedent considering\nprincipally whether the subsidiary \u201cperforms services that\nare sufficiently important to the foreign corporation that if\nit did not have a representative to perform them, the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n 12 MBUSA   is not a defendant in this case.\n16                     DAIMLER AG v.

Unocal Corp., 248 F. 3d 915, 928 (CA9 2001); em-\nphasis deleted).\n   This Court has not yet addressed whether a foreign\ncorporation may be subjected to a court\u2019s general jurisdic-\ntion based on the contacts of its in-state subsidiary. Daim-\nler argues, and several Courts of Appeals have held, that a\nsubsidiary\u2019s jurisdictional contacts can be imputed to its\nparent only when the former is so dominated by the latter\nas to be its alter ego. The Ninth Circuit adopted a less\nrigorous test based on what it described as an \u201cagency\u201d\nrelationship. Agencies, we note, come in many sizes and\nshapes: \u201cOne may be an agent for some business purposes\nand not others so that the fact that one may be an agent\nfor one purpose does not make him or her an agent for\nevery purpose.\u201d 2A C.

Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), observed, \u201cis a\nfiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a\nfact.\u201d Id., at 316. See generally 1 W.

As such, a corpora-\ntion can purposefully avail itself of a forum by directing its agents or\ndistributors to take action there. See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U. S., at 112\n(opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.)

The Court of Appeals did not advert to\nthat prospect. But we need not pass judgment on invoca-\ntion of an agency theory in the context of general jurisdic-\ntion, for in no event can the appeals court\u2019s analysis be\nsustained.\n   The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency finding rested primarily on\nits observation that MBUSA\u2019s services were \u201cimportant\u201d to\nDaimler, as gauged by Daimler\u2019s hypothetical readiness to\nperform those services itself if MBUSA did not exist.\nFormulated this way, the inquiry into importance stacks\nthe deck, for it will always yield a pro-jurisdiction answer:\n\u201cAnything a corporation does through an independent\ncontractor, subsidiary, or distributor is presumably some-\nthing that the corporation would do \u2018by other means\u2019 if the\nindependent contractor, subsidiary, or distributor did not\nexist.\u201d 676 F. 3d, at 777 (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc).14 The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency\ntheory thus appears to subject foreign corporations to\ngeneral jurisdiction whenever they have an in-state sub-\nsidiary or affiliate, an outcome that would sweep beyond\neven the \u201csprawling view of general jurisdiction\u201d we re-\njected in Goodyear. 564 U.

See Brief for Respondents 39, n. 18 (\u201cWe do not believe that\nthis gloss is particularly helpful.\u201d).\n  15 The Ninth Circuit\u2019s agency analysis also looked to whether the\n\nparent enjoys \u201cthe right to substantially control\u201d the subsidiary\u2019s\nactivities. Bauman v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 644 F. 3d 909, 924\n(2011). The Court of Appeals found the requisite \u201ccontrol\u201d demon-\nstrated by the General Distributor Agreement between Daimler and\nMBUSA, which gives Daimler the right to oversee certain of MBUSA\u2019s\noperations, even though that agreement expressly disavowed the\ncreation of any agency relationship. Thus grounded, the separate\ninquiry into control hardly curtails the overbreadth of the Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s agency holding.\n18                     DAIMLER AG v.

These bases afford plain-\ntiffs recourse to at least one clear and certain forum in\nwhich a corporate defendant may be sued on any and all\nclaims.\n   Goodyear did not hold that a corporation may be subject\nto general jurisdiction only in a forum where it is incor-\nporated or has its principal place of business; it simply\ntyped those places paradigm all-purpose forums. Plaintiffs\nwould have us look beyond the exemplar bases Goodyear\nidentified, and approve the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin every State in which a corporation \u201cengages in a sub-\nstantial, continuous, and systematic course of business.\u201d\nBrief for Respondents 16\u201317, and nn. 7\u20138. That formula-\ntion, we hold, is unacceptably grasping.\n   As noted, see supra, at 7\u20138, the words \u201ccontinuous and\nsystematic\u201d were used in International Shoe to describe\ninstances in which the exercise of specific jurisdiction\nwould be appropriate. See 326 U.

S. 100 (1898), and Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259,\n115 N. E. 915 (1917) (Cardozo, J.), both cited in Perkins v. Benguet\nConsol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), just after the statement that\na corporation\u2019s continuous operations in-state may suffice to establish\ngeneral jurisdiction. Id., at 446, and n. 6. See also International Shoe,\n326 U. S., at 318 (citing Tauza). Barrow and Tauza indeed upheld the\nexercise of general jurisdiction based on the presence of a local office,\nwhich signaled that the corporation was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the forum.\nPerkins\u2019 unadorned citations to these cases, both decided in the era\ndominated by Pennoyer\u2019s territorial thinking, see supra, at 6\u20137, should\nnot attract heavy reliance today. See generally Feder, Goodyear,\n\u201cHome,\u201d and the Uncertain Future of Doing Business Jurisdiction, 63\nS. C. L. Rev. 671 (2012) (questioning whether \u201cdoing business\u201d should\npersist as a basis for general jurisdiction).\n   19 We do not foreclose the possibility that in an exceptional case, see,\n\ne.g., Perkins, described supra, at 10\u201312, and n. 8, a corporation\u2019s opera-\ntions in a forum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal\nplace of business may be so substantial and of such a nature as to\nrender the corporation at home in that State. But this case presents no\noccasion to explore that question, because Daimler\u2019s activities in\nCalifornia plainly do not approach that level. It is one thing to hold a\ncorporation answerable for operations in the forum State, see infra, at\n23, quite another to expose it to suit on claims having no connection\nwhatever to the forum State.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

If Daimler\u2019s California activities suf-\nficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in\nCalifornia, the same global reach would presumably be\navailable in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\nsizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdic-\ntion would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants \u201cto\nstructure their primary conduct with some minimum\nassurance as to where that conduct will and will not ren-\nder them liable to suit.\u201d Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at\n472 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude\nthat Daimler, even with MBUSA\u2019s contacts attributed to\nit, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit\nthere on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do\nwith anything that occurred or had its principal impact in\nCalifornia.20\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   20 To clarify in light of JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s opinion concurring in the\n\njudgment, the general jurisdiction inquiry does not \u201cfocu[s] solely on the\nmagnitude of the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts.\u201d Post, at 8. General\njurisdiction instead calls for an appraisal of a corporation\u2019s activities in\ntheir entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A corporation that operates\nin many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them. Other-\nwise, \u201cat home\u201d would be synonymous with \u201cdoing business\u201d tests\nframed before specific jurisdiction evolved in the United States. See\nvon Mehren & Trautman 1142\u20131144. Nothing in International Shoe\nand its progeny suggests that \u201ca particular quantum of local activity\u201d\nshould give a State authority over a \u201cfar larger quantum of . . . activity\u201d\nhaving no connection to any in-state activity. Feder, supra, at 694.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would reach the same result, but for a different\nreason. Rather than concluding that Daimler is not at home in Cali-\nfornia, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR would hold that the exercise of general\njurisdiction over Daimler would be unreasonable \u201cin the unique circum-\nstances of this case.\u201d Post, at 1. In other words, she favors a resolution\nfit for this day and case only. True, a multipronged reasonableness\ncheck was articulated in Asahi, 480 U. S., at 113\u2013114, but not as a free-\nfloating test. Instead, the check was to be essayed when specific\njurisdiction is at issue. See also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471\nU. S. 462, 476\u2013478 (1985). First, a court is to determine whether the\n22                     DAIMLER AG v.

The Court of Appeals emphasized, as support-\nive of the exercise of general jurisdiction, plaintiffs\u2019 asser-\ntion of claims under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71350, and the Torture Victim Protection Act of\n1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C.\n\u00a71350. See 644 F. 3d, at 927 (\u201cAmerican federal courts, be\nthey in California or any other state, have a strong inter-\nest in adjudicating and redressing international human\nrights abuses.\u201d). Recent decisions of this Court, however,\nhave rendered plaintiffs\u2019 ATS and TVPA claims infirm.\nSee Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U. S. ___,\n___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) (presumption against extra-\nterritorial application controls claims under the ATS);\nMohamad v. Palestinian Authority, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nconnection between the forum and the episode-in-suit could justify the\nexercise of specific jurisdiction. Then, in a second step, the court is to\nconsider several additional factors to assess the reasonableness of\nentertaining the case. When a corporation is genuinely at home in the\nforum State, however, any second-step inquiry would be superfluous.\n  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR fears that our holding will \u201clead to greater un-\npredictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdictional dis-\ncovery.\u201d Post, at 14. But it is hard to see why much in the way of\ndiscovery would be needed to determine where a corporation is at home.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR\u2019s proposal to import Asahi\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d check\ninto the general jurisdiction determination, on the other hand, would\nindeed compound the jurisdictional inquiry. The reasonableness factors\nidentified in Asahi include \u201cthe burden on the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe interests\nof the forum State,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining relief,\u201d \u201cthe\ninterstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient\nresolution of controversies,\u201d \u201cthe shared interest of the several States in\nfurthering fundamental substantive social policies,\u201d and, in the inter-\nnational context, \u201cthe procedural and substantive policies of other\nnations whose interests are affected by the assertion of jurisdiction.\u201d\n480 U. S., at 113\u2013115 (some internal quotation marks omitted).

It has multiple facilities\nin the State, including a regional headquarters. Each\nyear, it distributes in California tens of thousands of cars,\nthe sale of which generated billions of dollars in the year\nthis suit was brought. And it provides service and sales\nsupport to customers throughout the State. Daimler has\nconceded that California courts may exercise general\njurisdiction over MBUSA on the basis of these contacts,\nand the Court assumes that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be\nattributed to Daimler for the purpose of deciding whether\nDaimler is also subject to general jurisdiction.\n  Are these contacts sufficient to permit the exercise of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Daimler? The Court holds that\nthey are not, for a reason wholly foreign to our due process\njurisprudence. The problem, the Court says, is not that\nDaimler\u2019s contacts with California are too few, but that its\n2                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncontacts with other forums are too many. In other words,\nthe Court does not dispute that the presence of multiple\noffices, the direct distribution of thousands of products\naccounting for billions of dollars in sales, and continuous\ninteraction with customers throughout a State would be\nenough to support the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nsome businesses. Daimler is just not one of those busi\u00ad\nnesses, the Court concludes, because its California con\u00ad\ntacts must be viewed in the context of its extensive \u201cna\u00ad\ntionwide and worldwide\u201d operations. Ante, at 21, n. 20. In\nrecent years, Americans have grown accustomed to the\nconcept of multinational corporations that are supposedly\n\u201ctoo big to fail\u201d; today the Court deems Daimler \u201ctoo big for\ngeneral jurisdiction.\u201d\n   The Court\u2019s conclusion is wrong as a matter of both\nprocess and substance. As to process, the Court decides\nthis case on a ground that was neither argued nor passed\non below, and that Daimler raised for the first time in a\nfootnote to its brief. Brief for Petitioner 31\u201332, n. 5. As\nto substance, the Court\u2019s focus on Daimler\u2019s operations out\u00ad\nside of California ignores the lodestar of our personal\njurisdiction jurisprudence: A State may subject a defend\u00ad\nant to the burden of suit if the defendant has sufficiently\ntaken advantage of the State\u2019s laws and protections\nthrough its contacts in the State; whether the defendant\nhas contacts elsewhere is immaterial.\n   Regrettably, these errors are unforced. The Court can\nand should decide this case on the far simpler ground that,\nno matter how extensive Daimler\u2019s contacts with Califor\u00ad\nnia, that State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would be unrea\u00ad\nsonable given that the case involves foreign plaintiffs\nsuing a foreign defendant based on foreign conduct, and\ngiven that a more appropriate forum is available. Because\nI would reverse the judgment below on this ground, I\nconcur in the judgment only.\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                        3\n\n                 SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n                              I\n   I begin with the point on which the majority and I agree:\nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed.\n   Our personal jurisdiction precedents call for a two-part\nanalysis. The contacts prong asks whether the defendant\nhas sufficient contacts with the forum State to support\npersonal jurisdiction; the reasonableness prong asks\nwhether the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable\nunder the circumstances. Burger King Corp. v. Rudze-\nwicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475\u2013478 (1985). As the majority\npoints out, all of the cases in which we have applied the\nreasonableness prong have involved specific as opposed to\ngeneral jurisdiction. Ante, at 21, n. 20. Whether the\nreasonableness prong should apply in the general jurisdic\u00ad\ntion context is therefore a question we have never decided,1\nand it is one on which I can appreciate the arguments on\nboth sides. But it would be imprudent to decide that\nquestion in this case given that respondents have failed to\nargue against the application of the reasonableness prong\nduring the entire 8-year history of this litigation. See\nBrief for Respondents 11, 12, 13, 16 (conceding application\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 The Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that the reasonableness\n\nprong does in fact apply in the general jurisdiction context. See Metro-\npolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F. 3d 560, 573 (CA2\n1996) (\u201c[E]very circuit that has considered the question has held,\nimplicitly or explicitly, that the reasonableness inquiry is applicable to\nall questions of personal jurisdiction, general or specific\u201d); see also, e.g.,\nLakin v. Prudential Securities, Inc., 348 F. 3d 704, 713 (CA8 2003);\nBase Metal Trading, Ltd. v. OJSC \u201cNovokuznetsky Aluminum Factory,\u201d\n283 F. 3d 208, 213\u2013214 (CA4 2002); Trierwelier v.

Without the\nbenefit of a single page of briefing on the issue, the majority casually\nadds each of these cases to the mounting list of decisions jettisoned as a\nconsequence of today\u2019s ruling. See ante, at 21, n. 20.\n4                     DAIMLER AG v.

Superior Court of Cal., Solano\nCty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987): \u201cthe burden on the defendant,\nthe interests of the forum State,\u201d \u201cthe plaintiff \u2019s interest\nin obtaining relief \u201d in the forum State, and the interests of\nother sovereigns in resolving the dispute. Id., at 113\u2013114.\nWe held in Asahi that it would be \u201cunreasonable and\nunfair\u201d for a California court to exercise jurisdiction over a\nclaim between a Taiwanese plaintiff and a Japanese de\u00ad\nfendant that arose out of a transaction in Taiwan, particu\u00ad\nlarly where the Taiwanese plaintiff had not shown that it\nwould be more convenient to litigate in California than in\nTaiwan or Japan. Id., at 114.\n  The same considerations resolve this case. It involves\nArgentine plaintiffs suing a German defendant for conduct\nthat took place in Argentina. Like the plaintiffs in Asahi,\nrespondents have failed to show that it would be more\nconvenient to litigate in California than in Germany, a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 While\n          our decisions rejecting the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nhave typically done so under the minimum-contacts prong, we have\nnever required that prong to be decided first. See Asahi Metal Industry\nCo. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102, 121 (1987)\n(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting\npersonal jurisdiction under the reasonableness prong and declining to\nconsider the minimum-contacts prong because doing so would not be\n\u201cnecessary\u201d). And although the majority frets that deciding this case on\nthe reasonableness ground would be \u201ca resolution fit for this day and\ncase only,\u201d ante, at 21, n. 20, I do not understand our constitutional\nduty to require otherwise.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Asahi thus makes clear that it would be unrea\u00ad\nsonable for a court in California to subject Daimler to its\njurisdiction.\n                              II\n  The majority evidently agrees that, if the reasonable\u00ad\nness prong were to apply, it would be unreasonable for\nCalifornia courts to exercise jurisdiction over Daimler in\nthis case. See ante, at 20\u201321 (noting that it would be \u201cexor\u00ad\nbitant\u201d for California courts to exercise general jurisdiction\nover Daimler, a German defendant, in this \u201cArgentina\u00ad\nrooted case\u201d brought by \u201cforeign plaintiffs\u201d). But instead\nof resolving the case on this uncontroversial basis, the\nmajority reaches out to decide it on a ground neither argued\nnor decided below.3\n  We generally do not pass on arguments that lower\ncourts have not addressed. See, e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n544 U. S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005). After all, \u201cwe are a court of\nreview, not of first view.\u201d Ibid. This principle carries even\ngreater force where the argument at issue was never\npressed below. See Glover v. United States, 531 U. S. 198,\n205 (2001). Yet the majority disregards this principle,\nbasing its decision on an argument raised for the first time\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The majority appears to suggest that Daimler may have presented\n\nthe argument in its petition for rehearing en banc before the Ninth\nCircuit. See ante, at 5 (stating that Daimler \u201curg[ed] that the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction . . . could not be reconciled with this Court\u2019s\ndecision in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S.\n___ (2011)\u201d). But Daimler\u2019s petition for rehearing did not argue\nwhat the Court holds today. The Court holds that Daimler\u2019s Califor-\nnia contacts would be insufficient for general jurisdiction even assum\u00ad\ning that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be attributed to Daimler. Daimler\u2019s\nrehearing petition made a distinct argument\u2014that attribution of\nMBUSA\u2019s contacts should not be permitted under an \u201c \u2018agency\u2019 theory\u201d\nbecause doing so would \u201crais[e] significant constitutional concerns\u201d\nunder Goodyear.

We granted\ncertiorari on the question \u201cwhether it violates due process\nfor a court to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a\nforeign corporation based solely on the fact that an indi\u00ad\nrect corporate subsidiary performs services on behalf of\nthe defendant in the forum State.\u201d Pet. for Cert. i. At no\npoint in Daimler\u2019s petition for certiorari did the company\ncontend that, even if this attribution question were de\u00ad\ncided against it, its contacts in California would still be in-\nsufficient to support general jurisdiction. The parties\u2019 merits\nbriefs accordingly focused on the attribution-of-contacts\nquestion, addressing the reasonableness inquiry (which\nhad been litigated and decided below) in most of the space\nthat remained. See Brief for Petitioner 17\u201337, 37\u201343;\nBrief for Respondents 18\u201347, 47\u201359.\n  In bypassing the question on which we granted certio\u00ad\nrari to decide an issue not litigated below, the Court leaves\nrespondents \u201cwithout an unclouded opportunity to air\nthe issue the Court today decides against them,\u201d Comcast\nCorp. v.

MBUSA imports\nmore than 200,000 vehicles into the United States and\ndistributes many of them to independent dealerships in\nCalifornia, where they are sold.

MBUSA\u2019s California\nsales account for 2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales, which\nwere $192 billion in 2004.4 And 2.4% of $192 billion is\n$4.6 billion, a considerable sum by any measure. MBUSA\nalso has multiple offices and facilities in California, in\u00ad\ncluding a regional headquarters.\n  But the record does not answer a number of other\nimportant questions. Are any of Daimler\u2019s key files main\u00ad\ntained in MBUSA\u2019s California offices? How many employ\u00ad\nees work in those offices? Do those employees make\nimportant strategic decisions or oversee in any manner\nDaimler\u2019s activities? These questions could well affect\nwhether Daimler is subject to general jurisdiction. After\nall, this Court upheld the exercise of general jurisdiction\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437,\n447\u2013448 (1952)\u2014which the majority refers to as a \u201ctext\u00ad\nbook case\u201d of general jurisdiction, ante, at 10\u2014on the basis\nthat the foreign defendant maintained an office in Ohio,\nkept corporate files there, and oversaw the company\u2019s\nactivities from the State. California-based MBUSA em\u00ad\nployees may well have done similar things on Daimler\u2019s\nbehalf.5 But because the Court decides the issue without a\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 See DaimlerChrysler, Innovations for our Customers: Annual Report\n2004, p. 22, http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/\n1364377_2004_DaimlerChrysler_Annual_Report.pdf (as visited on Jan. 8,\n2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file).\n  5 To be sure, many of Daimler\u2019s key management decisions are un\u00ad\n\ndoubtedly made by employees outside California.

But the majority recognizes that International Shoe\nseparately described the type of contacts needed for general jurisdiction\nas \u201ccontinuous corporate operations\u201d that are \u201cso substantial\u201d as to\njustify suit on unrelated causes of action. Id., at 318. It is unclear why\nour precedents departed from International Shoe\u2019s \u201ccontinuous and\nsubstantial\u201d formulation in favor of the \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d\nformulation, but the majority does not contend\u2014nor do I perceive\u2014that\nthere is a material difference between the two.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

If anything, we intimated that the defendant\u2019s Ohio\ncontacts were not substantial in comparison to its contacts\nelsewhere.

Ante, at 11, n. 8. The majority is quite correct that it\nhas found a sentence in Perkins that does not address whether most of\nthe Philippine corporation\u2019s activities took place outside of Ohio. See\nante, at 11, n. 8 (noting that Perkins described the company\u2019s \u201cwartime\nactivities\u201d as \u201cnecessarily limited,\u201d 342 U. S., at 448). That is why I did\nnot mention it.

That sentence obviously does convey that most of the\ncorporation\u2019s activities occurred in \u201cplaces other than Ohio,\u201d ante, at 11,\nn. 8. This is not surprising given that the company\u2019s Ohio contacts\ninvolved a single officer working from a home office, while its non-Ohio\ncontacts included significant mining properties and machinery operated\nthroughout the Philippines, Philippine employees (including a chief of\nstaff), a purchasing agent based in California, and board of directors\nmeetings held in Washington, New York, and San Francisco. Perkins,\n88 Ohio App., at 123\u2013124, 95 N. E. 2d, at 8; see also n. 8, infra.\n10                 DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nTexas.\n   Most recently, in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___ (2011), our analysis again\nfocused on the defendant\u2019s in-state contacts. Goodyear\ninvolved a suit against foreign tire manufacturers by\nNorth Carolina residents whose children had died in a bus\naccident in France. We held that North Carolina courts\ncould not exercise general jurisdiction over the foreign\ndefendants. Just as in Perkins and Helicopteros, our\nopinion in Goodyear did not identify the defendants\u2019 con\u00ad\ntacts outside of the forum State, but focused instead on the\ndefendants\u2019 lack of offices, employees, direct sales, and\nbusiness operations within the State.\n   This approach follows from the touchstone principle of\ndue process in this field, the concept of reciprocal fairness.\nWhen a corporation chooses to invoke the benefits and\nprotections of a State in which it operates, the State ac\u00ad\nquires the authority to subject the company to suit in its\ncourts. See International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 319 (\u201c[T]o the\nextent that a corporation exercises the privilege of con\u00ad\nducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and\nprotection of the laws of that state\u201d such that an \u201cobliga\u00ad\ntio[n] arise[s]\u201d to respond there to suit); J. McIntyre Ma-\nchinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5) (same principle for general\njurisdiction). The majority\u2019s focus on the extent of a corpo\u00ad\nrate defendant\u2019s out-of-forum contacts is untethered from\nthis rationale. After all, the degree to which a company\nintentionally benefits from a forum State depends on its\ninteractions with that State, not its interactions else\u00ad\nwhere. An article on which the majority relies (and on\nwhich Goodyear relied as well, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7)) expresses the point well: \u201cWe should not treat de\u00ad\nfendants as less amenable to suit merely because they\ncarry on more substantial business in other states . . . .\n[T]he amount of activity elsewhere seems virtually irrele\u00ad\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Rev. 721, 742 (1988).\n   Had the majority applied our settled approach, it would\nhave had little trouble concluding that Daimler\u2019s Califor\u00ad\nnia contacts rise to the requisite level, given the majority\u2019s\nassumption that MBUSA\u2019s contacts may be attributed to\nDaimler and given Daimler\u2019s concession that those con\u00ad\ntacts render MBUSA \u201cat home\u201d in California. Our cases\nhave long stated the rule that a defendant\u2019s contacts with\na forum State must be continuous, substantial, and sys\u00ad\ntematic in order for the defendant to be subject to that\nState\u2019s general jurisdiction. See Perkins, 342 U. S., at 446.\nWe offered additional guidance in Goodyear, adding the\nphrase \u201cessentially at home\u201d to our prior formulation of\nthe rule. 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (a State may\nexercise general jurisdiction where a defendant\u2019s \u201caffilia\u00ad\ntions with the State are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as\nto render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum\nState\u201d). We used the phrase \u201cat home\u201d to signify that in\norder for an out-of-state defendant to be subject to general\njurisdiction, its continuous and substantial contacts with a\nforum State must be akin to those of a local enterprise\nthat actually is \u201cat home\u201d in the State. See Brilmayer,\nsupra, at 742.8\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 The majority views the phrase \u201cat home\u201d as serving a different\n\npurpose\u2014that of requiring a comparison between a defendant\u2019s in-state\nand out-of-state contacts. Ante, at 21, n. 20. That cannot be the correct\nunderstanding though, because among other things it would cast grave\ndoubt on Perkins\u2014a case that Goodyear pointed to as an exemplar of\ngeneral jurisdiction, 564 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). For if Perkins\nhad applied the majority\u2019s newly minted proportionality test, it would\nhave come out the other way.\n  The majority apparently thinks that the Philippine corporate defend\u00ad\nant in Perkins did not have meaningful operations in places other than\nOhio. See ante, at 10\u201311, and n. 8. But one cannot get past the second\nsentence of Perkins before realizing that is wrong. That sentence reads:\n12                      DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\n   Under this standard, Daimler\u2019s concession that MBUSA\nis subject to general jurisdiction in California (a concession\nthe Court accepts, ante, at 15, 17) should be dispositive.\nFor if MBUSA\u2019s California contacts are so substantial and\nthe resulting benefits to MBUSA so significant as to make\nMBUSA \u201cat home\u201d in California, the same must be true of\nDaimler when MBUSA\u2019s contacts and benefits are viewed\nas its own. Indeed, until a footnote in its brief before this\nCourt, even Daimler did not dispute this conclusion for\neight years of the litigation.\n                             B\n     The majority today concludes otherwise. Referring to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u201cThe corporation has been carrying on in Ohio a continuous and sys\u00ad\ntematic, but limited, part of its general business.\u201d 342 U.

By the time the suit was commenced, the company had\nresumed its considerable mining operations in the Philippines, \u201c \u2018re\u00ad\nbuilding its properties\u2019 \u201d there and purchasing \u201c \u2018machinery, supplies\nand equipment.\u2019 \u201d 88 Ohio App., at 123\u2013124, 95 N.

E. 2d, at 8. The San Francisco purchasing\nagent negotiated the purchase of the company\u2019s machinery and supplies\n\u201c \u2018on the direction of the Company\u2019s Chief of Staff in Manila,\u2019 \u201d ibid., a\nfact that squarely refutes the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[a]ll of Ben\u00ad\nguet\u2019s activities were directed by the company\u2019s president from within\nOhio,\u201d ante, at 11, n. 8.

E.\n2d, at 8.\n    In light of these facts, it is all but impossible to reconcile the result in\nPerkins with the proportionality test the majority announces today.\nGoodyear\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cat home\u201d is thus better understood to\nrequire the same general jurisdiction inquiry that Perkins required: An\nout-of-state business must have the kind of continuous and substantial\nin-state presence that a parallel local company would have.\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Ante, at 21, n. 20.9\n   Neither of the majority\u2019s two rationales for this propor\u00ad\ntionality requirement is persuasive. First, the majority\nsuggests that its approach is necessary for the sake of\npredictability. Permitting general jurisdiction in every\nState where a corporation has continuous and substantial\ncontacts, the majority asserts, would \u201cscarcely permit out\u00ad\nof-state defendants \u2018to structure their primary conduct\nwith some minimum assurance as to where that conduct\nwill and will not render them liable to suit.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 21\n(quoting Burger King Corp., 471 U. S., at 472). But there\nis nothing unpredictable about a rule that instructs multi\u00ad\nnational corporations that if they engage in continuous\nand substantial contacts with more than one State, they\nwill be subject to general jurisdiction in each one. The\nmajority may not favor that rule as a matter of policy, but\nsuch disagreement does not render an otherwise routine\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 I accept at face value the majority\u2019s declaration that general juris\u00ad\n\ndiction is not limited to a corporation\u2019s place of incorporation and\nprincipal place of business because \u201ca corporation\u2019s operations in a\nforum other than its formal place of incorporation or principal place of\nbusiness may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the\ncorporation at home in the State.\u201d Ante, at 20, n. 19; see also ante, at\n19. Were that not so, our analysis of the defendants\u2019 in-state contacts\nin Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U. S. 437 (1952), Helicop-\nteros Nacionales de Colombia, S. A. v. Hall, 466 U.

BAUMAN\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ntest unpredictable.\n   Nor is the majority\u2019s proportionality inquiry any more\npredictable than the approach it rejects. If anything, the\nmajority\u2019s approach injects an additional layer of uncer\u00ad\ntainty because a corporate defendant must now try to\nforetell a court\u2019s analysis as to both the sufficiency of its\ncontacts with the forum State itself, as well as the relative\nsufficiency of those contacts in light of the company\u2019s\noperations elsewhere. Moreover, the majority does not\neven try to explain just how extensive the company\u2019s\nin-state contacts must be in the context of its global oper-\nations in order for general jurisdiction to be proper.\n   The majority\u2019s approach will also lead to greater unpre\u00ad\ndictability by radically expanding the scope of jurisdic\u00ad\ntional discovery. Rather than ascertaining the extent of a\ncorporate defendant\u2019s forum-state contacts alone, courts\nwill now have to identify the extent of a company\u2019s con\u00ad\ntacts in every other forum where it does business in order\nto compare them against the company\u2019s in-state contacts.\nThat considerable burden runs headlong into the major-\nity\u2019s recitation of the familiar principle that \u201c \u2018[s]imple\njurisdictional rules . . . promote greater predictability.\u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 18\u201319 (quoting Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U. S.\n77, 94 (2010)).\n   Absent the predictability rationale, the majority\u2019s sole\nremaining justification for its proportionality approach is\nits unadorned concern for the consequences. \u201cIf Daimler\u2019s\nCalifornia activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this\nArgentina-rooted case in California,\u201d the majority la\u00ad\nments, \u201cthe same global reach would presumably be avail\u00ad\nable in every other State in which MBUSA\u2019s sales are\nsizable.\u201d Ante, at 20.\n   The majority characterizes this result as \u201cexorbitant,\u201d\nibid., but in reality it is an inevitable consequence of the\nrule of due process we set forth nearly 70 years ago, that\nthere are \u201cinstances in which [a company\u2019s] continuous\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             15\n\n              SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\ncorporate operations within a state\u201d are \u201cso substantial\nand of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes\nof action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those\nactivities,\u201d International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 318. In the\nera of International Shoe, it was rare for a corporation to\nhave such substantial nationwide contacts that it would be\nsubject to general jurisdiction in a large number of States.\nToday, that circumstance is less rare. But that is as it\nshould be. What has changed since International Shoe is\nnot the due process principle of fundamental fairness but\nrather the nature of the global economy. Just as it was\nfair to say in the 1940\u2019s that an out-of-state company could\nenjoy the benefits of a forum State enough to make it\n\u201cessentially at home\u201d in the State, it is fair to say today that\na multinational conglomerate can enjoy such extensive\nbenefits in multiple forum States that it is \u201cessentially\nat home\u201d in each one.\n   In any event, to the extent the majority is concerned\nwith the modern-day consequences of International Shoe\u2019s\nconception of personal jurisdiction, there remain other\njudicial doctrines available to mitigate any resulting un\u00ad\nfairness to large corporate defendants. Here, for instance,\nthe reasonableness prong may afford petitioner relief. See\nsupra, at 3\u20134. In other cases, a defendant can assert the\ndoctrine of forum non conveniens if a given State is a\nhighly inconvenient place to litigate a dispute. See Gulf\nOil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U. S. 501, 508\u2013509 (1947). In still\nother cases, the federal change of venue statute can pro\u00ad\nvide protection. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a71404(a) (permitting\ntransfers to other districts \u201c[f]or the convenience of parties\nand witnesses\u201d and \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d). And to\nthe degree that the majority worries these doctrines are\nnot enough to protect the economic interests of multina\u00ad\ntional businesses (or that our longstanding approach to\ngeneral jurisdiction poses \u201crisks to international comity,\u201d\nante, at 22), the task of weighing those policy concerns\n16                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nbelongs ultimately to legislators, who may amend state\nand federal long-arm statutes in accordance with the\ndemocratic process. Unfortunately, the majority short\ncircuits that process by enshrining today\u2019s narrow rule of\ngeneral jurisdiction as a matter of constitutional law.\n                             C\n   The majority\u2019s concern for the consequences of its deci\u00ad\nsion should have led it the other way, because the rule\nthat it adopts will produce deep injustice in at least four\nrespects.\n   First, the majority\u2019s approach unduly curtails the\nStates\u2019 sovereign authority to adjudicate disputes against\ncorporate defendants who have engaged in continuous and\nsubstantial business operations within their boundaries.10\nThe majority does not dispute that a State can exercise\ngeneral jurisdiction where a corporate defendant has its\ncorporate headquarters, and hence its principal place of\nbusiness within the State. Cf. Hertz Corp., 559 U. S., at\n93. Yet it never explains why the State should lose that\npower when, as is increasingly common, a corporation\n\u201cdivide[s] [its] command and coordinating functions among\nofficers who work at several different locations.\u201d Id., at\n95\u201396. Suppose a company divides its management func\u00ad\ntions equally among three offices in different States, with\none office nominally deemed the company\u2019s corporate\nheadquarters. If the State where the headquarters is\nlocated can exercise general jurisdiction, why should the\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 States  will of course continue to exercise specific jurisdiction in\nmany cases, but we have never held that to be the outer limit of the\nStates\u2019 authority under the Due Process Clause. That is because the\ntwo forms of jurisdiction address different concerns. Whereas specific\njurisdiction focuses on the relationship between a defendant\u2019s chal\u00ad\nlenged conduct and the forum State, general jurisdiction focuses on the\ndefendant\u2019s substantial presence in the State irrespective of the loca\u00ad\ntion of the challenged conduct.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n             SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nother two States be constitutionally forbidden to do the\nsame? Indeed, under the majority\u2019s approach, the result\nwould be unchanged even if the company has substantial\noperations within the latter two States (and even if the\ncompany has no sales or other business operations in the\nfirst State). Put simply, the majority\u2019s rule defines the\nDue Process Clause so narrowly and arbitrarily as to\ncontravene the States\u2019 sovereign prerogative to subject to\njudgment defendants who have manifested an unqualified\n\u201cintention to benefit from and thus an intention to submit\nto the[ir] laws,\u201d J. McIntyre, 564 U. S., at ___ (plurality\nopinion) (slip op., at 5).\n   Second, the proportionality approach will treat small\nbusinesses unfairly in comparison to national and multi\u00ad\nnational conglomerates. Whereas a larger company will\noften be immunized from general jurisdiction in a State on\naccount of its extensive contacts outside the forum, a small\nbusiness will not be. For instance, the majority holds\ntoday that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in\nCalifornia despite its multiple offices, continuous opera\u00ad\ntions, and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of sales there. But\nimagine a small business that manufactures luxury vehi\u00ad\ncles principally targeting the California market and that\nhas substantially all of its sales and operations in the\nState\u2014even though those sales and operations may\namount to one-thousandth of Daimler\u2019s. Under the major\u00ad\nity\u2019s rule, that small business will be subject to suit in\nCalifornia on any cause of action involving any of its activ\u00ad\nities anywhere in the world, while its far more pervasive\ncompetitor, Daimler, will not be. That will be so even if\nthe small business incorporates and sets up its headquar\u00ad\nters elsewhere (as Daimler does), since the small business\u2019\nCalifornia sales and operations would still predominate\nwhen \u201capprais[ed]\u201d in proportion to its minimal \u201cnation\u00ad\nwide and worldwide\u201d operations, ante, at 21, n. 20.\n   Third, the majority\u2019s approach creates the incongruous\n18                    DAIMLER AG v. BAUMAN\n\n                SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in judgment\n\nresult that an individual defendant whose only contact\nwith a forum State is a one-time visit will be subject to\ngeneral jurisdiction if served with process during that\nvisit, Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin,\n495 U. S. 604 (1990), but a large corporation that owns\nproperty, employs workers, and does billions of dollars\u2019\nworth of business in the State will not be, simply because\nthe corporation has similar contacts elsewhere (though the\nvisiting individual surely does as well).\n   Finally, it should be obvious that the ultimate effect of\nthe majority\u2019s approach will be to shift the risk of loss\nfrom multinational corporations to the individuals harmed\nby their actions. Under the majority\u2019s rule, for example, a\nparent whose child is maimed due to the negligence of a\nforeign hotel owned by a multinational conglomerate will\nbe unable to hold the hotel to account in a single U. S.\ncourt, even if the hotel company has a massive presence in\nmultiple States. See, e.g., Meier v. Sun Int\u2019l Hotels, Ltd.,\n288 F. 3d 1264 (CA11 2002).11 Similarly, a U. S. business\nthat enters into a contract in a foreign country to sell its\nproducts to a multinational company there may be unable\nto seek relief in any U. S. court if the multinational com\u00ad\npany breaches the contract, even if that company has\nconsiderable operations in numerous U. S. forums. See,\ne.g., Walpex Trading Co. v.
