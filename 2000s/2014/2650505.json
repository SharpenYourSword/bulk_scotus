Argued November 5, 2013—Decided January 22, 2014\nPetitioner Medtronic, Inc., designs, makes, and sells medical devices.\n  Respondent Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, owns patents relating\n  to implantable heart stimulators. They have a licensing agreement\n  that permits Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in ex-\n  change for royalty payments, and that specifies procedures to identify\n  products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the\n  parties. Pursuant to those procedures, Mirowski notified Medtronic\n  of its belief that several of Medtronic’s products infringed the licensed\n  patents, and Medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringe-\n  ment in a declaratory judgment action, while accumulating disputed\n  royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party.\n  The District Court concluded that Mirowski, as the party asserting\n  infringement, had the burden of proving infringement and that\n  Mirowski had not met that burden. The Federal Circuit disagreed.\n  It acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof,\n  but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment de-\n  fendant and, like Mirowski, is foreclosed from asserting an infringe-\n  ment counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agree-\n  ment, the party seeking the declaratory judgment, namely Medtronic,\n  bears the burden of persuasion.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction in\n this case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1338(a) gives federal district courts ex-\n clusive jurisdiction over “any civil action arising under any Act of\n Congress relating to patents,” and §1295(a)(1) gives the Federal Cir-\n cuit appellate jurisdiction over any case where jurisdiction in the dis-\n trict court “was based, in whole or in part, on section 1338.” The De-\n2     MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    claratory Judgment Act does not “extend” the federal courts’ “juris-\n    diction,” Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 671;\n    and federal courts determining declaratory judgment jurisdiction of-\n    ten look to the “character” of the declaratory judgment defendant’s\n    “threatened action,” Public Serv. Comm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344\n    U. S. 237, 248, i.e., whether the defendant’s hypothetical “coercive ac-\n    tion” “would necessarily present a federal question,” Franchise Tax\n    Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n    463 U. S. 1, 19. Here, if Medtronic had acted consistent with the un-\n    derstanding of its rights that it seeks to establish through the declar-\n    atory judgment suit (by ceasing to pay royalties), Mirowski could\n    terminate the license and bring a suit for infringement. That suit\n    would arise under federal patent law because “patent law creates the\n    cause of action.” Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486\n    U. S. 800, 809. Thus, this declaratory judgment action, which avoids\n    that hypothetical threatened action, also “arises under” federal pa-\n    tent law. See, e.g., Security-First Nat. Bank of Los Angeles v. Fran-\n    chise Tax Bd. of Cal., 368 U. S. 3, 19. Pp. 4–6.\n       2. When a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee\n    that its products do not infringe the licensed patent, the patentee\n    bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of infringement. Pp. 6–\n    11.\n          (a) This conclusion is strongly supported by three settled legal\n    propositions: First, a patentee ordinarily bears the burden of proving\n    infringement, see, e.g., Agawam Co. v. Jordan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 609; sec-\n    ond, the “operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act” is only “proce-\n    dural,” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240, leaving\n    “substantive rights unchanged,” Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover,\n    359 U. S. 500, 509; and third, “the burden of proof” is a “ ‘substantive’\n    aspect of a claim,” Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530 U. S. 15,\n    20–21. Practical considerations lead to the same conclusion. Shifting\n    the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation\n    uncertainty about a patent’s scope. It may also create unnecessary\n    complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative. Finally,\n    burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the Declaratory Judg-\n    ment Act’s purpose of ameliorating the “dilemma” posed by “putting”\n    one challenging a patent’s scope “to the choice between abandoning\n    his rights or risking” suit, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549\n    U. S. 118, 129. To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s burden shift-\n    ing rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous,\n    that rule recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act\n    sought to avoid. Pp. 6–9.\n          (b) Several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. First,\n    Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, which noted the “ordinary default\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  rule” that “plaintiffs” have the “risk of failing to prove their claims,”\n  does not support the Federal Circuit’s conclusion. Schaffer was not a\n  declaratory judgment case, and it described exceptions to its basic\n  burden of proof rule. For reasons explained in this case, declaratory\n  judgment suits like this one are an exception to Schaffer’s default\n  rule. Second, the fact that the Federal Circuit limited its holding to\n  the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counter-\n  claim by a patentee cannot, by itself, show that the holding is legally\n  justified. Third, contrary to one amicus’ concern that this Court’s\n  holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into full-blown\n  infringement litigation, such litigation can occur only when there is a\n  genuine and sufficiently “immedia[te]” dispute about a patent’s valid-\n  ity or application, MedImmune, supra, at 127. Here, Mirowski set\n  this dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement, and\n  there is no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor\n  the patentee. General considerations relating to the public interest\n  in maintaining a well-functioning patent system are, at most, in bal-\n  ance, and do not favor changing the ordinary burden of proof rule.\n  Pp. 9–11.\n695 F. 3d 1266, reversed and remanded.\n\n  BREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 571 U.

This case asks us to decide whether the burden of\nproof shifts when the patentee is a defendant in a declara-\ntory judgment action, and the plaintiff (the potential\ninfringer) seeks a judgment that he does not infringe the\npatent. We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory\njudgment against a patentee to establish that there is no\ninfringement, the burden of proving infringement remains\nwith the patentee. We reverse the Federal Circuit’s de-\ntermination to the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   We set forth a simplified version of the facts. The par-\nties are Medtronic, Inc., a firm that (among other things)\ndesigns, makes, and sells medical devices, and Mirowski\nFamily Ventures, LLC, a firm that owns patents relating\nto implantable heart stimulators. In 1991 Medtronic and\nMirowski entered into an agreement permitting Medtronic\nto practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty\n2   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayments.\n   In less simplified form: Mirowski entered into a license\nagreement with Eli Lilly & Co., which then sublicensed\nthe Mirowski patents to Medtronic. Guidant Corp. is Eli\nLilly’s successor in interest. For present purposes we shall\nignore Eli Lilly, Guidant, and other parties on Mirowski’s\nside, using “Mirowski” to refer to any and all of them.\n   The 1991 agreement also provided that, if Mirowski\ngave notice to Medtronic that a new Medtronic product\n“infringe[d]” a Mirowski patent, Medtronic had a choice.\nApp. 13. Medtronic could simply “cure the nonpayment of\nroyalties.” Ibid. Or it could pay royalties and, at the same\ntime, “challenge” the “assertion of infringement of any of\nthe Mirowski patents through a Declaratory Judgment\naction.” Ibid. Medtronic, of course, might just ignore the\nagreement and decide not to pay royalties at all, in which\ncase Mirowski would have “the right to terminate the\n[l]icense,” ibid., and, if it wished, bring an infringement\naction.\n   In 2006 the parties entered into a further agreement\nthat slightly modified the procedure for resolving disputes.\nIf Medtronic, having received “timely written notice of\ninfringement,” chose to pursue a declaratory judgment\naction “challenging infringement,” it could “accumulate\ndisputed royalties” in an escrow account. Id., at 24, 27.\nThe prevailing party in the declaratory judgment action\nwould receive the royalties. Id., at 28.\n   In 2007 the parties found themselves in the midst of\nan “infringement” dispute. Mirowski gave Medtronic notice\nthat it believed seven new Medtronic products violated\nvarious claims contained in two of its patents (related to\ndevices that cause the heart’s ventricles to contract simul-\ntaneously as the heart beats). Medtronic thought that its\nproducts did not infringe Mirowski’s patents, either be-\ncause the products fell outside the scope of the patent\nclaims or because the patents were invalid.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n  In 2007 Medtronic brought this declaratory judgment\naction in Federal District Court in Delaware. It sought a\ndeclaration that its products did not infringe Mirowski’s\npatents and that the patents were invalid. But, as its\nagreement with Mirowski provided, Medtronic paid all the\nrelevant royalties into an escrow account.\n  The District Court recognized that Mirowski was the\ndefendant in the action. But it nonetheless believed that\nMirowski, “[a]s the part[y] asserting infringement,” bore\nthe burden of proving infringement. Medtronic, Inc. v.\nBoston Scientific Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766 (Del.\n2011); see Under Sea Industries, Inc. v. Dacor Corp., 833\nF. 2d 1551, 1557 (CA Fed. 1987) (“The burden always is on\nthe patentee to show infringement”). After a bench trial,\nthe court found that Mirowski had not proved infringe-\nment, either directly or under the doctrine of equivalents.\nAnd since Mirowski, the patentee, bore the burden of\nproof, it lost. 777 F. Supp. 2d, at 767–770.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered\nthe burden of proof question, and it came to the opposite\nconclusion. It held that Medtronic, the declaratory judg-\nment plaintiff, bore the burden. It acknowledged that\nnormally the patentee, not the accused infringer, bears the\nburden of proving infringement, and that the burden\nnormally will not “shift” even when the patentee is “a\ncounterclaiming defendant in a declaratory judgment\naction.” 695 F. 3d 1266, 1272 (2012). Nonetheless, the\nCourt of Appeals believed that a different rule applies\nwhere that patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant\nand, like Mirowski, that patentee/defendant is “foreclosed”\nfrom asserting an “infringement counterclaim” by the\n“continued existence of a license.” Id., at 1274. In that\ncase, the Court of Appeals held, the party “seeking a de-\nclaratory judgment of noninfringement,” namely Medtronic,\n“bears the burden of persuasion.” Ibid.\n4   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Medtronic sought certiorari, asking us to review the\nFederal Circuit’s burden of proof rule. In light of the\nimportance of burdens of proof in patent litigation, we\ngranted the petition.\n                             II\n   We begin with a jurisdictional matter. An amicus\nclaims that we must vacate the Federal Circuit’s decision\nbecause that court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.\nAmicus agrees with the parties that 28 U. S. C. §1338(a)\ngives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over\n“any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relat-\ning to patents” (emphasis added). Moreover, the version of\n§1295(a)(1) governing this appeal gives the Federal Circuit\nexclusive appellate jurisdiction over any case where juris-\ndiction in the district court “was based, in whole or in\npart, on section 1338.” But, amicus says, in determining\nwhether this case is a “civil action arising under” an “Act\nof Congress relating to patents,” we must look to the na-\nture of the action that the declaratory judgment defend-\nant, namely the patentee, Mirowski, could have brought in\nthe absence of a declaratory judgment. And that action,\namicus adds (in its most significant argument against\njurisdiction), would not be a patent infringement action\nbut, rather, an action for damages for breach of contract,\nnamely an action for breach of the Mirowski-Medtronic\nlicensing contract, in which patent infringement is the\ncentral issue. See Brief for Tessera Technologies, Inc., as\nAmicus Curiae 2–3.\n   We agree with amicus that the Declaratory Judgment\nAct does not “extend” the “jurisdiction” of the federal\ncourts. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S.\n667, 671 (1950). We also agree that federal courts, when\ndetermining declaratory judgment jurisdiction, often look\nto the “character of the threatened action.” Public Serv.\nComm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 248 (1952).\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThat is to say, they ask whether “a coercive action”\nbrought by “the declaratory judgment defendant” (here\nMirowski) “would necessarily present a federal question.”\nFranchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vaca-\ntion Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19 (1983).\n    But we do not agree with amicus’ characterization of\nthe “threatened” or “coercive” action that Mirowski might\nhave brought. The patent licensing agreement specifies\nthat, if Medtronic stops paying royalties, Mirowski can\nterminate the contract and bring an ordinary patent in-\nfringement action. Such an action would arise under\nfederal patent law because “federal patent law creates the\ncause of action.” Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating\nCorp., 486 U. S. 800, 809 (1988).\n    Amicus says that an infringement suit would be un-\nlikely. But that is not the relevant question. The relevant\nquestion concerns the nature of the threatened action in\nthe absence of the declaratory judgment suit. Medtronic\nbelieves—and seeks to establish in this declaratory judg-\nment suit—that it does not owe royalties because its prod-\nucts are noninfringing. If Medtronic were to act on that\nbelief (by not paying royalties and not bringing a declara-\ntory judgment action), Mirowski could terminate the\nlicense and bring an ordinary federal patent law action for\ninfringement. See Brief for Respondent 48 (acknowledg-\ning that if Medtronic had “chosen not to pay the royalties\n. . . it would have subjected itself to a suit for infringe-\nment”). Consequently this declaratory judgment action,\nwhich avoids that threatened action, also “arises under”\nfederal patent law. See Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 19;\nWycoff Co., supra, at 248. See also MedImmune, Inc. v.\nGenentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 128 (2007) (concluding\nthat Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement was satis-\nfied where a patent licensee faced the threat of suit if it\nceased making payments under a license agreement, not-\nwithstanding that the licensee’s continued royalty pay-\n6   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nments rendered the prospect of such a suit “remote, if not\nnonexistent”).\n  For this reason we believe that the hypothetical threat-\nened action is properly characterized as an action “arising\nunder an Act of Congress relating to patents.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1338(a).\n                             III\n  We now turn to the question presented. A patent li-\ncensee paying royalties into an escrow account under a pat-\nent licensing agreement seeks a declaratory judgment that\nsome of its products are not covered by or do not infringe\nthe patent, and that it therefore does not owe royalties for\nthose products. In that suit, who bears the burden of\nproof, or, to be more precise, the burden of persuasion?\nMust the patentee prove infringement or must the licensee\nprove noninfringement? In our view, the burden of per-\nsuasion is with the patentee, just as it would be had the\npatentee brought an infringement suit.\n                               A\n   Simple legal logic, resting upon settled case law, strongly\nsupports our conclusion. It is well established that the\nburden of proving infringement generally rests upon the\npatentee. See, e.g., Imhaeuser v. Buerk, 101 U. S. 647, 662\n(1880) (“[T]he burden to prove infringement never shifts\n[to the alleged infringer] if the charge is denied in the plea\nor answer”); Agawam Co., 7 Wall., at 609 (“Infringement is\nan affirmative allegation made by the complainant, and\nthe burden of proving it is upon him . . .”). See also Under\nSea Industries, 833 F. 2d, at 1557 (“The burden always is\non the patentee to show infringement”); 5B Chisum\n§18.06[1][a], at 18–1180 (2007) (“[T]he burden of proof on\nfactual issues relating to infringement rests upon the\npatent owner”).\n   We have long considered “the operation of the Declara-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntory Judgment Act” to be only “procedural,” Aetna Life Ins.\nCo. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937), leaving “sub-\nstantive rights unchanged,” Beacon Theatres, Inc. v.\nWestover, 359 U. S. 500, 509 (1959). See also Vaden v.\nDiscover Bank, 556 U. S. 49, 70, n. 19 (2009); Skelly Oil\nCo., 339 U. S., at 674 (noting the “limited procedural\npurpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act”).\n   And we have held that “the burden of proof ” is a “ ‘sub-\nstantive’ aspect of a claim.” Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of\nRevenue, 530 U. S. 15, 20–21 (2000); Director, Office of\nWorkers’ Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries,\n512 U. S. 267, 271 (1994) (“[T]he assignment of the burden\nof proof is a rule of substantive law . . .”); Garrett v. Moore-\nMcCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239, 249 (1942) (“[T]he burden\nof proof . . . [is] part of the very substance of [the plain-\ntiff ’s] claim and cannot be considered a mere incident of a\nform of procedure”).\n   Taken together these three legal propositions indicate\nthat, in a licensee’s declaratory judgment action, the\nburden of proving infringement should remain with the\npatentee.\n   Several practical considerations lead to the same con-\nclusion. To shift the burden depending upon the form of\nthe action could create postlitigation uncertainty about the\nscope of the patent. Suppose the evidence is inconclusive,\nand an alleged infringer loses his declaratory judgment\naction because he failed to prove noninfringement. The\nalleged infringer, or others, might continue to engage in\nthe same allegedly infringing behavior, leaving it to the\npatentee to bring an infringement action. If the burden\nshifts, the patentee might lose that action because, the\nevidence being inconclusive, he failed to prove infringe-\nment. So, both sides might lose as to infringement,\nleaving the infringement question undecided, creating\nuncertainty among the parties and others who seek to\nknow just what products and processes they are free to use.\n8   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The example is not fanciful. The Restatement (Second)\nof Judgments says that relitigation of an issue (say, in-\nfringement) decided in one suit “is not precluded” in a\nsubsequent suit where the burden of persuasion “has\nshifted” from the “party against whom preclusion is sought\n. . . to his adversary.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n§28(4) (1980). Rather, the\n    “[f ]ailure of one party to carry the burden of persua-\n    sion on an issue should not establish the issue in favor\n    of an adversary who otherwise would have the burden\n    of persuasion on that issue in later litigation.” 18 C.\n    Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and\n    Procedure §4422, p. 592 (2d ed. 2002).\nThus the declaratory judgment suit in the example above\nwould have failed to achieve its object: to provide “an\nimmediate and definitive determination of the legal rights\nof the parties.” Aetna, supra, at 241.\n   Moreover, to shift the burden can, at least on occasion,\ncreate unnecessary complexity by making it difficult for\nthe licensee to understand upon just what theory the\npatentee’s infringement claim rests. A complex patent can\ncontain many pages of claims and limitations. A patent\nholder is in a better position than an alleged infringer to\nknow, and to be able to point out, just where, how, and\nwhy a product (or process) infringes a claim of that patent.\nUntil he does so, however, the alleged infringer may have\nto work in the dark, seeking, in his declaratory judg-\nment complaint, to negate every conceivable infringement\ntheory.\n   Finally burden shifting here is difficult to reconcile with\na basic purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act. In\nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., a case that similarly\nconcerned a patent licensee that brought a declaratory\njudgment action after the patentee accused it of infringe-\nment, we wrote that the “ ‘very purpose’ ” of that Act is to\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“ ‘ameliorate’ ” the “dilemma” posed by “putting” one who\nchallenges a patent’s scope “to the choice between aban-\ndoning his rights or risking” suit. 549 U. S., at 129 (quot-\ning Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 152\n(1967)). In the absence of the declaratory judgment proce-\ndure, Medtronic would face the precise dilemma that\nMedImmune describes. Either Medtronic would have to\nabandon its right to challenge the scope of Mirowski’s\npatents, or it would have to stop paying royalties, risk\nlosing an ordinary patent infringement lawsuit, and\nthereby risk liability for treble damages and attorney’s\nfees as well as injunctive relief. See 35 U. S. C. §§283–285\n(providing for injunctive relief, treble damages, and—in\n“exceptional cases”—attorney’s fees as remedies for patent\ninfringement). As in MedImmune, the declaratory judg-\nment action rescues Medtronic from this dilemma.\n    The Federal Circuit’s burden shifting rule does not\ndeprive Medtronic of the right to seek a declaratory judg-\nment. But it does create a significant obstacle to use of that\naction. It makes the declaratory judgment procedure—\ncompared to, say, just refusing to pay royalties—dis-\nadvantageous. To that extent it recreates the dilemma\nthat the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid. As we\nhave made clear (and as we explain below), we are un-\naware of any strong reason for creating that obstacle.\n                               B\n   We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the\ncontrary. First, the Federal Circuit thought it had found\nsupport in a recent case of this Court, Schaffer v. Weast,\n546 U. S. 49 (2005). In that case we referred to the “ordi-\nnary default rule” as placing upon the “plaintiffs” the “risk\nof failing to prove their claims.” Id., at 56. We added that\nthat is because the plaintiffs are normally the parties\n“seeking relief.” Id., at 58. And Medtronic, not Mirowski,\nis the declaratory judgment “plaintif[f ]” here.\n10 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Schaffer, however, was not a declaratory judgment case.\nAnd Schaffer described exceptions to its basic burden of\nproof rule. E.g., id., at 57 (when an element of a claim\n“can fairly be characterized as [an] affirmative defens[e],”\nthe burden of proof “may be shifted to [the] defendants”);\nid., at 60 (“ ‘[T]he ordinary rule, based on considerations\nof fairness, does not place the burden upon a litigant of\nestablishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his\nadversary’ ” (quoting United States v. New York, N. H. &\nH. R. Co., 355 U. S. 253, 256, n. 5 (1957)). For the reasons\nwe have set forth in Part III–A, supra, declaratory judg-\nment suits like the one at issue here constitute a further\nexception to the basic rule Schaffer described.\n   Second, the Federal Circuit emphasized that its holding\napplied only in “the limited circumstance when an in-\nfringement counterclaim by a patentee is foreclosed by the\ncontinued existence of a license.” 695 F. 3d, at 1274. The\nfact that the Federal Circuit’s opinion is limited, how-\never, does not support its conclusion. The “limited cir-\ncumstance” it described is often present when a patent\nlicensee faces an ordinary but disputed claim of infringe-\nment. And that “circumstance” is virtually identical to\nMedImmune, where we found a declaratory judgment action\nconstitutionally permissible. In any event, the fact that a\nrule’s scope is limited cannot, by itself, show that the rule\nis legally justified.\n   Third, an amicus supporting Mirowski fears that our\nholding, unlike the Federal Circuit’s rule, will “burden . . .\npatent owners” by permitting “a licensee . . . —at its sole\ndiscretion—[to] force the patentee into full-blown patent-\ninfringement litigation.” Brief for Intellectual Property\nOwners Association as Amicus Curiae 9. The short an-\nswer to this argument, however, is that litigation can\noccur only in the presence of a genuine dispute, “ ‘of suffi-\ncient immediacy and reality,’ ” about the patent’s validity\nor its application. MedImmune, supra, at 127 (quoting\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMaryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U. S.\n270, 273 (1941)). Indeed, it was Mirowski that set the\npresent dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of in-\nfringement. And in such an instance, we see no convinc-\ning reason why burden of proof law should favor the\npatentee.\n    The public interest, of course, favors the maintenance of\na well-functioning patent system. But the “public” also\nhas a “paramount interest in seeing that patent monopo-\nlies . . . are kept within their legitimate scope.” Precision\nInstrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machin-\nery Co., 324 U. S. 806, 816 (1945). A patentee “should\nnot be . . . allowed to exact royalties for the use of an idea\n. . . that is beyond the scope of the patent monopoly\ngranted.” Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of\nIll. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 349–350 (1971). And\n“[l]icensees may often be the only individuals with enough\neconomic incentive” to litigate questions of a patent’s\nscope. Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653, 670 (1969). The\ngeneral public interest considerations are, at most, in\nbalance. They do not favor a change in the ordinary rule\nimposing the burden of proving infringement upon the\npatentee.\n    For these reasons the judgment of the Federal Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2650505, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/01/22/medtronic_inc._v._mirowski_family_ventures_llc.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 5, 2013—Decided January 22, 2014\nPetitioner Medtronic, Inc., designs, makes, and sells medical devices.\n  Respondent Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, owns patents relating\n  to implantable heart stimulators. They have a licensing agreement\n  that permits Medtronic to practice certain Mirowski patents in ex-\n  change for royalty payments, and that specifies procedures to identify\n  products covered by the license and to resolve disputes between the\n  parties. Pursuant to those procedures, Mirowski notified Medtronic\n  of its belief that several of Medtronic’s products infringed the licensed\n  patents, and Medtronic then challenged that assertion of infringe-\n  ment in a declaratory judgment action, while accumulating disputed\n  royalties in an escrow account for distribution to the prevailing party.\n  The District Court concluded that Mirowski, as the party asserting\n  infringement, had the burden of proving infringement and that\n  Mirowski had not met that burden. The Federal Circuit disagreed.\n  It acknowledged that a patentee normally bears the burden of proof,\n  but concluded that where the patentee is a declaratory judgment de-\n  fendant and, like Mirowski, is foreclosed from asserting an infringe-\n  ment counterclaim by the continued existence of a licensing agree-\n  ment, the party seeking the declaratory judgment, namely Medtronic,\n  bears the burden of persuasion.\nHeld:\n    1. The Federal Circuit did not lack subject-matter jurisdiction in\n this case. Title 28 U. S. C. §1338(a) gives federal district courts ex-\n clusive jurisdiction over “any civil action arising under any Act of\n Congress relating to patents,” and §1295(a)(1) gives the Federal Cir-\n cuit appellate jurisdiction over any case where jurisdiction in the dis-\n trict court “was based, in whole or in part, on section 1338.” The De-\n2     MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    claratory Judgment Act does not “extend” the federal courts’ “juris-\n    diction,” Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S. 667, 671;\n    and federal courts determining declaratory judgment jurisdiction of-\n    ten look to the “character” of the declaratory judgment defendant’s\n    “threatened action,” Public Serv. Comm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344\n    U. S. 237, 248, i.e., whether the defendant’s hypothetical “coercive ac-\n    tion” “would necessarily present a federal question,” Franchise Tax\n    Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal.,\n    463 U. S. 1, 19. Here, if Medtronic had acted consistent with the un-\n    derstanding of its rights that it seeks to establish through the declar-\n    atory judgment suit (by ceasing to pay royalties), Mirowski could\n    terminate the license and bring a suit for infringement. That suit\n    would arise under federal patent law because “patent law creates the\n    cause of action.” Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486\n    U. S. 800, 809. Thus, this declaratory judgment action, which avoids\n    that hypothetical threatened action, also “arises under” federal pa-\n    tent law. See, e.g., Security-First Nat. Bank of Los Angeles v. Fran-\n    chise Tax Bd. of Cal., 368 U. S. 3, 19. Pp. 4–6.\n       2. When a licensee seeks a declaratory judgment against a patentee\n    that its products do not infringe the licensed patent, the patentee\n    bears the burden of persuasion on the issue of infringement. Pp. 6–\n    11.\n          (a) This conclusion is strongly supported by three settled legal\n    propositions: First, a patentee ordinarily bears the burden of proving\n    infringement, see, e.g., Agawam Co. v. Jordan, 7 Wall. 583, 609; sec-\n    ond, the “operation of the Declaratory Judgment Act” is only “proce-\n    dural,” Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240, leaving\n    “substantive rights unchanged,” Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover,\n    359 U. S. 500, 509; and third, “the burden of proof” is a “ ‘substantive’\n    aspect of a claim,” Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530 U. S. 15,\n    20–21. Practical considerations lead to the same conclusion. Shifting\n    the burden based on the form of the action could create postlitigation\n    uncertainty about a patent’s scope. It may also create unnecessary\n    complexity by compelling a licensee to prove a negative. Finally,\n    burden shifting is difficult to reconcile with the Declaratory Judg-\n    ment Act’s purpose of ameliorating the “dilemma” posed by “putting”\n    one challenging a patent’s scope “to the choice between abandoning\n    his rights or risking” suit, MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549\n    U. S. 118, 129. To the extent that the Federal Circuit’s burden shift-\n    ing rule makes the declaratory judgment procedure disadvantageous,\n    that rule recreates the dilemma that the Declaratory Judgment Act\n    sought to avoid. Pp. 6–9.\n          (b) Several arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. First,\n    Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U. S. 49, which noted the “ordinary default\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                      3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  rule” that “plaintiffs” have the “risk of failing to prove their claims,”\n  does not support the Federal Circuit’s conclusion. Schaffer was not a\n  declaratory judgment case, and it described exceptions to its basic\n  burden of proof rule. For reasons explained in this case, declaratory\n  judgment suits like this one are an exception to Schaffer’s default\n  rule. Second, the fact that the Federal Circuit limited its holding to\n  the circumstance where a license forecloses an infringement counter-\n  claim by a patentee cannot, by itself, show that the holding is legally\n  justified. Third, contrary to one amicus’ concern that this Court’s\n  holding will permit licensees to force patent holders into full-blown\n  infringement litigation, such litigation can occur only when there is a\n  genuine and sufficiently “immedia[te]” dispute about a patent’s valid-\n  ity or application, MedImmune, supra, at 127. Here, Mirowski set\n  this dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of infringement, and\n  there is no convincing reason why burden of proof law should favor\n  the patentee. General considerations relating to the public interest\n  in maintaining a well-functioning patent system are, at most, in bal-\n  ance, and do not favor changing the ordinary burden of proof rule.\n  Pp. 9–11.\n695 F. 3d 1266, reversed and remanded.\n\n  BREYER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n                        Cite as: 571 U.

Agawam Co. v. Jordan, 7 Wall. 583, 609\n(1869). This case asks us to decide whether the burden of\nproof shifts when the patentee is a defendant in a declara-\ntory judgment action, and the plaintiff (the potential\ninfringer) seeks a judgment that he does not infringe the\npatent. We hold that, when a licensee seeks a declaratory\njudgment against a patentee to establish that there is no\ninfringement, the burden of proving infringement remains\nwith the patentee. We reverse the Federal Circuit’s de-\ntermination to the contrary.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   We set forth a simplified version of the facts. The par-\nties are Medtronic, Inc., a firm that (among other things)\ndesigns, makes, and sells medical devices, and Mirowski\nFamily Ventures, LLC, a firm that owns patents relating\nto implantable heart stimulators. In 1991 Medtronic and\nMirowski entered into an agreement permitting Medtronic\nto practice certain Mirowski patents in exchange for royalty\n2   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\npayments.\n   In less simplified form: Mirowski entered into a license\nagreement with Eli Lilly & Co., which then sublicensed\nthe Mirowski patents to Medtronic. Guidant Corp. is Eli\nLilly’s successor in interest. For present purposes we shall\nignore Eli Lilly, Guidant, and other parties on Mirowski’s\nside, using “Mirowski” to refer to any and all of them.\n   The 1991 agreement also provided that, if Mirowski\ngave notice to Medtronic that a new Medtronic product\n“infringe[d]” a Mirowski patent, Medtronic had a choice.\nApp. 13. Medtronic could simply “cure the nonpayment of\nroyalties.” Ibid. Or it could pay royalties and, at the same\ntime, “challenge” the “assertion of infringement of any of\nthe Mirowski patents through a Declaratory Judgment\naction.” Ibid. Medtronic, of course, might just ignore the\nagreement and decide not to pay royalties at all, in which\ncase Mirowski would have “the right to terminate the\n[l]icense,” ibid., and, if it wished, bring an infringement\naction.\n   In 2006 the parties entered into a further agreement\nthat slightly modified the procedure for resolving disputes.\nIf Medtronic, having received “timely written notice of\ninfringement,” chose to pursue a declaratory judgment\naction “challenging infringement,” it could “accumulate\ndisputed royalties” in an escrow account. Id., at 24, 27.\nThe prevailing party in the declaratory judgment action\nwould receive the royalties. Id., at 28.\n   In 2007 the parties found themselves in the midst of\nan “infringement” dispute. Mirowski gave Medtronic notice\nthat it believed seven new Medtronic products violated\nvarious claims contained in two of its patents (related to\ndevices that cause the heart’s ventricles to contract simul-\ntaneously as the heart beats). Medtronic thought that its\nproducts did not infringe Mirowski’s patents, either be-\ncause the products fell outside the scope of the patent\nclaims or because the patents were invalid.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                              B\n\n  In 2007 Medtronic brought this declaratory judgment\naction in Federal District Court in Delaware. It sought a\ndeclaration that its products did not infringe Mirowski’s\npatents and that the patents were invalid. But, as its\nagreement with Mirowski provided, Medtronic paid all the\nrelevant royalties into an escrow account.\n  The District Court recognized that Mirowski was the\ndefendant in the action. But it nonetheless believed that\nMirowski, “[a]s the part[y] asserting infringement,” bore\nthe burden of proving infringement. Medtronic, Inc. v.\nBoston Scientific Corp., 777 F. Supp. 2d 750, 766 (Del.\n2011); see Under Sea Industries, Inc. v. Dacor Corp., 833\nF. 2d 1551, 1557 (CA Fed. 1987) (“The burden always is on\nthe patentee to show infringement”). After a bench trial,\nthe court found that Mirowski had not proved infringe-\nment, either directly or under the doctrine of equivalents.\nAnd since Mirowski, the patentee, bore the burden of\nproof, it lost. 777 F. Supp. 2d, at 767–770.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered\nthe burden of proof question, and it came to the opposite\nconclusion. It held that Medtronic, the declaratory judg-\nment plaintiff, bore the burden. It acknowledged that\nnormally the patentee, not the accused infringer, bears the\nburden of proving infringement, and that the burden\nnormally will not “shift” even when the patentee is “a\ncounterclaiming defendant in a declaratory judgment\naction.” 695 F. 3d 1266, 1272 (2012). Nonetheless, the\nCourt of Appeals believed that a different rule applies\nwhere that patentee is a declaratory judgment defendant\nand, like Mirowski, that patentee/defendant is “foreclosed”\nfrom asserting an “infringement counterclaim” by the\n“continued existence of a license.” Id., at 1274. In that\ncase, the Court of Appeals held, the party “seeking a de-\nclaratory judgment of noninfringement,” namely Medtronic,\n“bears the burden of persuasion.” Ibid.\n4   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n  Medtronic sought certiorari, asking us to review the\nFederal Circuit’s burden of proof rule. In light of the\nimportance of burdens of proof in patent litigation, we\ngranted the petition.\n                             II\n   We begin with a jurisdictional matter. An amicus\nclaims that we must vacate the Federal Circuit’s decision\nbecause that court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.\nAmicus agrees with the parties that 28 U. S. C. §1338(a)\ngives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over\n“any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relat-\ning to patents” (emphasis added). Moreover, the version of\n§1295(a)(1) governing this appeal gives the Federal Circuit\nexclusive appellate jurisdiction over any case where juris-\ndiction in the district court “was based, in whole or in\npart, on section 1338.” But, amicus says, in determining\nwhether this case is a “civil action arising under” an “Act\nof Congress relating to patents,” we must look to the na-\nture of the action that the declaratory judgment defend-\nant, namely the patentee, Mirowski, could have brought in\nthe absence of a declaratory judgment. And that action,\namicus adds (in its most significant argument against\njurisdiction), would not be a patent infringement action\nbut, rather, an action for damages for breach of contract,\nnamely an action for breach of the Mirowski-Medtronic\nlicensing contract, in which patent infringement is the\ncentral issue. See Brief for Tessera Technologies, Inc., as\nAmicus Curiae 2–3.\n   We agree with amicus that the Declaratory Judgment\nAct does not “extend” the “jurisdiction” of the federal\ncourts. Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U. S.\n667, 671 (1950). We also agree that federal courts, when\ndetermining declaratory judgment jurisdiction, often look\nto the “character of the threatened action.” Public Serv.\nComm’n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 248 (1952).\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nThat is to say, they ask whether “a coercive action”\nbrought by “the declaratory judgment defendant” (here\nMirowski) “would necessarily present a federal question.”\nFranchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vaca-\ntion Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 19 (1983).\n    But we do not agree with amicus’ characterization of\nthe “threatened” or “coercive” action that Mirowski might\nhave brought. The patent licensing agreement specifies\nthat, if Medtronic stops paying royalties, Mirowski can\nterminate the contract and bring an ordinary patent in-\nfringement action. Such an action would arise under\nfederal patent law because “federal patent law creates the\ncause of action.” Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating\nCorp., 486 U. S. 800, 809 (1988).\n    Amicus says that an infringement suit would be un-\nlikely. But that is not the relevant question. The relevant\nquestion concerns the nature of the threatened action in\nthe absence of the declaratory judgment suit. Medtronic\nbelieves—and seeks to establish in this declaratory judg-\nment suit—that it does not owe royalties because its prod-\nucts are noninfringing. If Medtronic were to act on that\nbelief (by not paying royalties and not bringing a declara-\ntory judgment action), Mirowski could terminate the\nlicense and bring an ordinary federal patent law action for\ninfringement. See Brief for Respondent 48 (acknowledg-\ning that if Medtronic had “chosen not to pay the royalties\n. . . it would have subjected itself to a suit for infringe-\nment”). Consequently this declaratory judgment action,\nwhich avoids that threatened action, also “arises under”\nfederal patent law. See Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 19;\nWycoff Co., supra, at 248. See also MedImmune, Inc. v.\nGenentech, Inc., 549 U. S. 118, 128 (2007) (concluding\nthat Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement was satis-\nfied where a patent licensee faced the threat of suit if it\nceased making payments under a license agreement, not-\nwithstanding that the licensee’s continued royalty pay-\n6   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nments rendered the prospect of such a suit “remote, if not\nnonexistent”).\n  For this reason we believe that the hypothetical threat-\nened action is properly characterized as an action “arising\nunder an Act of Congress relating to patents.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1338(a).\n                             III\n  We now turn to the question presented. A patent li-\ncensee paying royalties into an escrow account under a pat-\nent licensing agreement seeks a declaratory judgment that\nsome of its products are not covered by or do not infringe\nthe patent, and that it therefore does not owe royalties for\nthose products. In that suit, who bears the burden of\nproof, or, to be more precise, the burden of persuasion?\nMust the patentee prove infringement or must the licensee\nprove noninfringement? In our view, the burden of per-\nsuasion is with the patentee, just as it would be had the\npatentee brought an infringement suit.\n                               A\n   Simple legal logic, resting upon settled case law, strongly\nsupports our conclusion. It is well established that the\nburden of proving infringement generally rests upon the\npatentee. See, e.g., Imhaeuser v. Buerk, 101 U. S. 647, 662\n(1880) (“[T]he burden to prove infringement never shifts\n[to the alleged infringer] if the charge is denied in the plea\nor answer”); Agawam Co., 7 Wall., at 609 (“Infringement is\nan affirmative allegation made by the complainant, and\nthe burden of proving it is upon him . . .”). See also Under\nSea Industries, 833 F. 2d, at 1557 (“The burden always is\non the patentee to show infringement”); 5B Chisum\n§18.06[1][a], at 18–1180 (2007) (“[T]he burden of proof on\nfactual issues relating to infringement rests upon the\npatent owner”).\n   We have long considered “the operation of the Declara-\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)              7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ntory Judgment Act” to be only “procedural,” Aetna Life Ins.\nCo. v. Haworth, 300 U. S. 227, 240 (1937), leaving “sub-\nstantive rights unchanged,” Beacon Theatres, Inc. v.\nWestover, 359 U. S. 500, 509 (1959). See also Vaden v.\nDiscover Bank, 556 U. S. 49, 70, n. 19 (2009); Skelly Oil\nCo., 339 U. S., at 674 (noting the “limited procedural\npurpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act”).\n   And we have held that “the burden of proof ” is a “ ‘sub-\nstantive’ aspect of a claim.” Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of\nRevenue, 530 U. S. 15, 20–21 (2000); Director, Office of\nWorkers’ Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries,\n512 U. S. 267, 271 (1994) (“[T]he assignment of the burden\nof proof is a rule of substantive law . . .”); Garrett v. Moore-\nMcCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239, 249 (1942) (“[T]he burden\nof proof . . . [is] part of the very substance of [the plain-\ntiff ’s] claim and cannot be considered a mere incident of a\nform of procedure”).\n   Taken together these three legal propositions indicate\nthat, in a licensee’s declaratory judgment action, the\nburden of proving infringement should remain with the\npatentee.\n   Several practical considerations lead to the same con-\nclusion. To shift the burden depending upon the form of\nthe action could create postlitigation uncertainty about the\nscope of the patent. Suppose the evidence is inconclusive,\nand an alleged infringer loses his declaratory judgment\naction because he failed to prove noninfringement. The\nalleged infringer, or others, might continue to engage in\nthe same allegedly infringing behavior, leaving it to the\npatentee to bring an infringement action. If the burden\nshifts, the patentee might lose that action because, the\nevidence being inconclusive, he failed to prove infringe-\nment. So, both sides might lose as to infringement,\nleaving the infringement question undecided, creating\nuncertainty among the parties and others who seek to\nknow just what products and processes they are free to use.\n8   MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n    The example is not fanciful. The Restatement (Second)\nof Judgments says that relitigation of an issue (say, in-\nfringement) decided in one suit “is not precluded” in a\nsubsequent suit where the burden of persuasion “has\nshifted” from the “party against whom preclusion is sought\n. . . to his adversary.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments\n§28(4) (1980). Rather, the\n    “[f ]ailure of one party to carry the burden of persua-\n    sion on an issue should not establish the issue in favor\n    of an adversary who otherwise would have the burden\n    of persuasion on that issue in later litigation.” 18 C.\n    Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and\n    Procedure §4422, p. 592 (2d ed. 2002).\nThus the declaratory judgment suit in the example above\nwould have failed to achieve its object: to provide “an\nimmediate and definitive determination of the legal rights\nof the parties.” Aetna, supra, at 241.\n   Moreover, to shift the burden can, at least on occasion,\ncreate unnecessary complexity by making it difficult for\nthe licensee to understand upon just what theory the\npatentee’s infringement claim rests. A complex patent can\ncontain many pages of claims and limitations. A patent\nholder is in a better position than an alleged infringer to\nknow, and to be able to point out, just where, how, and\nwhy a product (or process) infringes a claim of that patent.\nUntil he does so, however, the alleged infringer may have\nto work in the dark, seeking, in his declaratory judg-\nment complaint, to negate every conceivable infringement\ntheory.\n   Finally burden shifting here is difficult to reconcile with\na basic purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act. In\nMedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., a case that similarly\nconcerned a patent licensee that brought a declaratory\njudgment action after the patentee accused it of infringe-\nment, we wrote that the “ ‘very purpose’ ” of that Act is to\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“ ‘ameliorate’ ” the “dilemma” posed by “putting” one who\nchallenges a patent’s scope “to the choice between aban-\ndoning his rights or risking” suit. 549 U. S., at 129 (quot-\ning Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 152\n(1967)). In the absence of the declaratory judgment proce-\ndure, Medtronic would face the precise dilemma that\nMedImmune describes. Either Medtronic would have to\nabandon its right to challenge the scope of Mirowski’s\npatents, or it would have to stop paying royalties, risk\nlosing an ordinary patent infringement lawsuit, and\nthereby risk liability for treble damages and attorney’s\nfees as well as injunctive relief. See 35 U. S. C. §§283–285\n(providing for injunctive relief, treble damages, and—in\n“exceptional cases”—attorney’s fees as remedies for patent\ninfringement). As in MedImmune, the declaratory judg-\nment action rescues Medtronic from this dilemma.\n    The Federal Circuit’s burden shifting rule does not\ndeprive Medtronic of the right to seek a declaratory judg-\nment. But it does create a significant obstacle to use of that\naction. It makes the declaratory judgment procedure—\ncompared to, say, just refusing to pay royalties—dis-\nadvantageous. To that extent it recreates the dilemma\nthat the Declaratory Judgment Act sought to avoid. As we\nhave made clear (and as we explain below), we are un-\naware of any strong reason for creating that obstacle.\n                               B\n   We are not convinced by the arguments raised to the\ncontrary. First, the Federal Circuit thought it had found\nsupport in a recent case of this Court, Schaffer v. Weast,\n546 U. S. 49 (2005). In that case we referred to the “ordi-\nnary default rule” as placing upon the “plaintiffs” the “risk\nof failing to prove their claims.” Id., at 56. We added that\nthat is because the plaintiffs are normally the parties\n“seeking relief.” Id., at 58. And Medtronic, not Mirowski,\nis the declaratory judgment “plaintif[f ]” here.\n10 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. MIROWSKI FAMILY VENTURES, LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Schaffer, however, was not a declaratory judgment case.\nAnd Schaffer described exceptions to its basic burden of\nproof rule. E.g., id., at 57 (when an element of a claim\n“can fairly be characterized as [an] affirmative defens[e],”\nthe burden of proof “may be shifted to [the] defendants”);\nid., at 60 (“ ‘[T]he ordinary rule, based on considerations\nof fairness, does not place the burden upon a litigant of\nestablishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his\nadversary’ ” (quoting United States v. New York, N. H. &\nH. R. Co., 355 U. S. 253, 256, n. 5 (1957)). For the reasons\nwe have set forth in Part III–A, supra, declaratory judg-\nment suits like the one at issue here constitute a further\nexception to the basic rule Schaffer described.\n   Second, the Federal Circuit emphasized that its holding\napplied only in “the limited circumstance when an in-\nfringement counterclaim by a patentee is foreclosed by the\ncontinued existence of a license.” 695 F. 3d, at 1274. The\nfact that the Federal Circuit’s opinion is limited, how-\never, does not support its conclusion. The “limited cir-\ncumstance” it described is often present when a patent\nlicensee faces an ordinary but disputed claim of infringe-\nment. And that “circumstance” is virtually identical to\nMedImmune, where we found a declaratory judgment action\nconstitutionally permissible. In any event, the fact that a\nrule’s scope is limited cannot, by itself, show that the rule\nis legally justified.\n   Third, an amicus supporting Mirowski fears that our\nholding, unlike the Federal Circuit’s rule, will “burden . . .\npatent owners” by permitting “a licensee . . . —at its sole\ndiscretion—[to] force the patentee into full-blown patent-\ninfringement litigation.” Brief for Intellectual Property\nOwners Association as Amicus Curiae 9. The short an-\nswer to this argument, however, is that litigation can\noccur only in the presence of a genuine dispute, “ ‘of suffi-\ncient immediacy and reality,’ ” about the patent’s validity\nor its application. MedImmune, supra, at 127 (quoting\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nMaryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U. S.\n270, 273 (1941)). Indeed, it was Mirowski that set the\npresent dispute in motion by accusing Medtronic of in-\nfringement. And in such an instance, we see no convinc-\ning reason why burden of proof law should favor the\npatentee.\n    The public interest, of course, favors the maintenance of\na well-functioning patent system. But the “public” also\nhas a “paramount interest in seeing that patent monopo-\nlies . . . are kept within their legitimate scope.” Precision\nInstrument Mfg. Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machin-\nery Co., 324 U. S. 806, 816 (1945). A patentee “should\nnot be . . . allowed to exact royalties for the use of an idea\n. . . that is beyond the scope of the patent monopoly\ngranted.” Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of\nIll. Foundation, 402 U. S. 313, 349–350 (1971). And\n“[l]icensees may often be the only individuals with enough\neconomic incentive” to litigate questions of a patent’s\nscope. Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U. S. 653, 670 (1969). The\ngeneral public interest considerations are, at most, in\nbalance. They do not favor a change in the ordinary rule\nimposing the burden of proving infringement upon the\npatentee.\n    For these reasons the judgment of the Federal Circuit is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                               It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2650505/", "sha1": "f6e61583cab5bd29f4c096b8e4a9837605e27d8e", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-014", "time_retrieved": "2014-01-22T17:01:28.324600"}
