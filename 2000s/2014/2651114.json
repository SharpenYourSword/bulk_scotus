UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 12\u2013417.      Argued November 4, 2013\u2014Decided January 27, 2014\nPetitioner Sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under\n  the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent\n  donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert re-\n  spondent United States Steel Corporation requires workers to wear\n  because of hazards at its steel plants. U. S. Steel contends that this\n  donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable\n  under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collective-\n  bargaining agreement with petitioners\u2019 union. That provision\u2019s valid-\n  ity depends on 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(o), which allows parties to collectively\n  bargain over whether \u201ctime spent in changing clothes . . . at the be-\n  ginning or end of each workday\u201d must be compensated. The District\n  Court granted U. S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, hold-\n  ing that petitioners\u2019 donning and doffing constituted \u201cchanging\n  clothes\u201d under \u00a7203(o). It also assumed that any time spent donning\n  and doffing items that were not \u201cclothes\u201d was \u201cde minimis\u201d and hence\n  noncompensable. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective\n gear is not compensable by operation of \u00a7203(o). Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) This Court initially construed compensability under the Fair\n Labor Standards Act expansively. See, e.g., Anderson v. Mt. Clemens\n Pottery Co., 328 U. S. 680. The Act was amended in 1949, however,\n to provide that the compensability of time spent \u201cchanging clothes or\n washing at the beginning or end of each workday\u201d is a subject appro-\n priately committed to collective bargaining, \u00a7203(o). Whether peti-\n tioners\u2019 donning and doffing qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d depends\n on the meaning of that statutory phrase. Pp. 3\u20136.\n    (b) The term \u201cclothes,\u201d which is otherwise undefined, is \u201cinterpret-\n ed as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d Perrin\n2            SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42. In dictionaries from the era of\n    \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment, \u201cclothes\u201d denotes items that are both designed\n    and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of\n    dress. Nothing in \u00a7203(o)\u2019s text or context suggests anything other\n    than this ordinary meaning. There is no basis for petitioners\u2019 propo-\n    sition that the unmodified term \u201cclothes\u201d somehow omits protective\n    clothing. Section 203(o)\u2019s exception applies only when the changing\n    of clothes is \u201can integral and indispensable part of the principal activ-\n    ities for which covered workmen are employed,\u201d Steiner v. Mitchell,\n    350 U. S. 247, 256, and thus otherwise compensable under the Act.\n    See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a). And protective gear is the only clothing that\n    is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such\n    as butchers and longshoremen. Petitioners\u2019 position is also incompat-\n    ible with the historical context of \u00a7203(o)\u2019s passage, contradicting\n    contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in Stei-\n    ner, see 350 U. S., at 248, 254\u2013255. The interpretation adopted here\n    leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items\n    that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices. The view\n    of respondent and its amici that \u201cclothes\u201d encompasses the entire out-\n    fit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual\n    foundation. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (c) While the normal meaning of \u201cchanging clothes\u201d connotes sub-\n    stitution, \u201cchanging\u201d also carried the meaning to \u201calter\u201d at the time of\n    \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment. The broader statutory context makes plain that\n    \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d includes time spent in altering\n    dress. Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or\n    simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely\n    personal choice, and \u00a7203(o) should not be read to allow workers to\n    opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another\n    reading is textually permissible. Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (d) Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning\n    and doffing in this case qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d under \u00a7203(o).\n    Of the 12 items at issue, only 3\u2014safety glasses, earplugs, and a res-\n    pirator\u2014do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of \u201cclothes.\u201d\n    Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the\n    minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes de-\n    voted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of\n    Appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law\n    does not take account of trifles). But that doctrine does not fit com-\n    fortably within this statute, which is all about trifles. A more appro-\n    priate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue\n    can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as \u201ctime spent in changing\n    clothes or washing.\u201d If an employee devotes the vast majority of that\n    time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  entire period would not qualify as \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d\n  under \u00a7203(o), even if some clothes items were also donned and\n  doffed. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and\n  doffing \u201cclothes\u201d as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the\n  time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.\n  Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court\u2019s conclusion\n  that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs\n  was minimal. And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District\n  Court\u2019s additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Cir-\n  cuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during\n  the normal workday and thus fell beyond \u00a7203(o)\u2019s scope.

UNITED\n         STATES STEEL CORPORATION\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n           APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                                [January 27, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.*\n  The question before us is the meaning of the phrase\n\u201cchanging clothes\u201d as it appears in the Fair Labor Stand-\nards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7201 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n              I. Facts and Procedural History\n  Petitioner Clifton Sandifer, among others, filed suit\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act against respondent\nUnited States Steel Corporation in the District Court for\nthe Northern District of Indiana. The plaintiffs in this\nputative collective action are a group of current or former\nemployees of respondent\u2019s steelmaking facilities.1 As\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins this opinion except as to footnote 7.\n   1 Petitioners filed this action under 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), which estab-\n\nlishes a cause of action that may be maintained \u201cby any one or more\nemployees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employ-\nees similarly situated.\u201d Pending resolution of the instant summary-\njudgment dispute, a Magistrate Judge set aside a motion to certify the\nsuit as a collective action, see No. 2:07\u2013CV\u2013443 RM, 2009 WL 3430222,\n*1, n. 1 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009), but petitioners assert that their ranks\nare about 800 strong.\n2           SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, they seek backpay for time spent donning\nand doffing various pieces of protective gear. Petitioners\nassert that respondent requires workers to wear all of the\nitems because of hazards regularly encountered in steel\nplants.\n   Petitioners point specifically to 12 of what they state are\nthe most common kinds of required protective gear: a\nflame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat;\na \u201csnood\u201d; \u201cwristlets\u201d; work gloves; leggings; \u201cmetatarsal\u201d\nboots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator.2 At bot-\ntom, petitioners want to be paid for the time they have\nspent putting on and taking off those objects. In the ag-\ngregate, the amount of time\u2014and thus money\u2014involved is\nlikely to be quite large. Because this donning-and-doffing\ntime would otherwise be compensable under the Act, U. S.\nSteel\u2019s contention of noncompensability stands or falls\nupon the validity of a provision of its collective-bargaining\nagreement with petitioners\u2019 union, which says that this\ntime is noncompensable.3 The validity of that provision\ndepends, in turn, upon the applicability of 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7203(o) to the time at issue. That subsection allows par-\nties to decide, as part of a collective-bargaining agreement,\nthat \u201ctime spent in changing clothes . . . at the beginning\nor end of each workday\u201d is noncompensable.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment in perti-\nnent part to U. S. Steel, holding that donning and doffing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        opinions below include descriptions of some of the items. See\n678 F. 3d 590, 592 (CA7 2012); 2009 WL 3430222, *2, *6. And the\nopinion of the Court of Appeals provides a photograph of a male model\nwearing the jacket, pants, hardhat, snood, gloves, boots, and glasses.\n678 F. 3d, at 593.\n  3 The District Court concluded that the collective-bargaining agree-\n\nment provided that the activities at issue here were noncompensable,\n2009 WL 3430222, *10, and the Seventh Circuit upheld that conclusion,\n678 F. 3d, at 595. That issue was not among the questions on which we\ngranted certiorari, and we take the import of the collective-bargaining\nagreement to be a given.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe protective gear constituted \u201cchanging clothes\u201d within\nthe meaning of \u00a7203(o). No. 2:07\u2013CV\u2013443 RM, 2009 WL\n3430222, *4\u2013*10 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009). The District\nCourt further assumed that even if certain items\u2014the\nhardhat, glasses, and earplugs\u2014were not \u201cclothes,\u201d the\ntime spent donning and doffing them was \u201cde minimis\u201d\nand hence noncompensable. Id., at *6. The Court of\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld those conclusions.\n678 F. 3d 590, 593\u2013595 (2012).4\n  We granted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\naffirm.\n                    II. Legal Background\n   The Fair Labor Standards Act, enacted in 1938, governs\nminimum wages and maximum hours for non-exempt\n\u201cemployees who in any workweek [are] engaged in com-\nmerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or [are]\nemployed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the\nproduction of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7206(a)\n(minimum wages); \u00a7207(a) (maximum hours); see \u00a7213\n(exemptions). The Act provides that \u201cemployee\u201d generally\nmeans \u201cany individual employed by an employer,\u201d\n\u00a7203(e)(1), and, in turn, provides that to \u201cemploy\u201d is \u201cto\nsuffer or permit to work,\u201d \u00a7203(g).\n   The Act did not, however, define the key terms \u201cwork\u201d\nand \u201cworkweek\u201d\u2014an omission that soon let loose a land-\nslide of litigation. See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n25\u201326 (2005). This Court gave those terms a broad read-\ning, culminating in its holding in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens\nPottery Co., 328 U. S. 680 (1946), that \u201cthe statutory\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Petitioners also sought, inter alia, backpay for time spent traveling\n\nbetween the locker rooms where they don and doff at least some of the\nprotective gear and their workstations. The District Court denied that\nportion of respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, 2009 WL\n3430222, *11, and the Seventh Circuit reversed, 678 F. 3d, at 595\u2013598.\nThat issue is not before this Court, so we express no opinion on it.\n4        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nworkweek includes all time during which an employee is\nnecessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s premises, on\nduty or at a prescribed workplace.\u201d Id., at 690\u2013691. That\nperiod, Anderson explained, encompassed time spent\n\u201cpursu[ing] certain preliminary activities after arriving\n. . . , such as putting on aprons and overalls [and] remov-\ning shirts.\u201d Id., at 692\u2013693. \u201cThese activities,\u201d the Court\ndeclared, \u201care clearly work\u201d under the Act. Id., at 693.\n    Organized labor seized on the Court\u2019s expansive con-\nstruction of compensability by filing what became known\nas \u201cportal\u201d actions (a reference to the \u201cportals\u201d or entranc-\nes to mines, at which workers put on their gear).\n\u201cPORTAL PAY SUITS EXCEED A BILLION,\u201d announced\na newspaper headline in late 1946. N. Y. Times, Dec. 29,\n1946, p. 1. Stating that the Fair Labor Standards Act\nhad been \u201cinterpreted judicially in disregard of long-\nestablished customs, practices, and contracts between\nemployers and employees,\u201d Congress responded by passing\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 84, as amended,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7251 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. V). \u00a7251(a).\n    The Portal-to-Portal Act limited the scope of employers\u2019\nliability in various ways. As relevant here, it excluded\nfrom mandatorily compensable time\n    \u201cactivities which are preliminary to or postliminary to\n    [the] principal activity or activities [that an employee\n    is employed to perform], which occur either prior to\n    the time on any particular workday at which such\n    employee commences, or subsequent to the time on\n    any particular workday at which he ceases, such prin-\n    cipal activity or activities.\u201d 61 Stat. 87, 29 U. S. C.\n    \u00a7254(a)(2).\n   The Department of Labor promulgated a regulation\nexplaining that the Portal-to-Portal Act did not alter what\nis known as the \u201ccontinuous workday rule,\u201d under which\ncompensable time comprises \u201cthe period between the\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

Of particular importance to this case, a Labor\nDepartment interpretive bulletin also specified that\nwhereas \u201cchanging clothes\u201d and \u201cwashing up or shower-\ning\u201d \u201cwould be considered \u2018preliminary\u2019 or \u2018postliminary\u2019\nactivities\u201d when \u201cperformed outside the workday and . . .\nunder the conditions normally present,\u201d those same activi-\nties \u201cmay in certain situations be so directly related to the\nspecific work the employee is employed to perform that\n[they] would be regarded as an integral part of the em-\nployee\u2019s \u2018principal activity.\u2019 \u201d 12 Fed. Reg. 7659, and n. 49;\n29 CFR \u00a7790.7, and n. 49.\n   In 1949, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards\nAct to address the conduct discussed in that interpretive\nbulletin\u2014changing clothes and washing\u2014by adding the\nprovision presently at issue:\n    \u201cHours Worked.\u2014In determining for the purposes of\n    [the minimum-wage and maximum-hours sections] of\n    this title the hours for which an employee is em-\n    ployed, there shall be excluded any time spent in\n    changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n    of each workday which was excluded from measured\n    working time during the week involved by the express\n    terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide\n    collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the par-\n    ticular employee.\u201d 63 Stat. 911, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(o).\nSimply put, the statute provides that the compensability\nof time spent changing clothes or washing is a subject\nappropriately committed to collective bargaining.\n  In Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247 (1956), the Court\nechoed the Labor Department\u2019s 1947 regulations by hold-\ning that \u201cchanging clothes and showering\u201d can, under\n6            SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsome circumstances, be considered \u201can integral and indis-\npensable part of the principal activities for which covered\nworkmen are employed,\u201d reasoning that \u00a7203(o) \u201cclear[ly]\nimpli[ed]\u201d as much. Id., at 254\u2013256. And in IBP, we\napplied Steiner to treat as compensable the donning and\ndoffing of protective gear somewhat similar to that at\nissue here, 546 U. S., at 30. We said that \u201cany activity\nthat is \u2018integral and indispensable\u2019 to a \u2018principal activity\u2019\nis itself a \u2018principal activity\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7254(a), id., at 37.\n   As relevant to the question before us, U. S. Steel does\nnot dispute the Seventh Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[h]ad\nthe clothes-changing time in this case not been rendered\nnoncompensable pursuant to [\u00a7]203(o), it would have been\na principal activity.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 596. Petitioners, how-\never, quarrel with the premise, arguing that the donning\nand doffing of protective gear does not qualify as \u201cchang-\ning clothes.\u201d\n                        III. Analysis\n                        A. \u201cClothes\u201d\n   We begin by examining the meaning of the word\n\u201cclothes.\u201d5 It is a \u201cfundamental canon of statutory con-\nstruction\u201d that, \u201cunless otherwise defined, words will be\ninterpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, com-\nmon meaning.\u201d Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42\n(1979).\n   Dictionaries from the era of \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment indicate\nthat \u201cclothes\u201d denotes items that are both designed and\nused to cover the body and are commonly regarded as\narticles of dress. See Webster\u2019s New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 507 (2d ed. 1950) (Web-\nster\u2019s Second) (defining \u201cclothes\u201d as \u201c[c]overing for the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Althoughthe Labor Department has construed \u00a7203(o) on a number\nof occasions, the Government has expressly declined to ask us to defer\nto those interpretations, which have vacillated considerably over the\nyears.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhuman body; dress; vestments; vesture\u201d); see also, e.g., 2\nOxford English Dictionary 524 (1933) (defining \u201cclothes\u201d\nas \u201c[c]overing for the person; wearing apparel; dress,\nraiment, vesture\u201d). That is what we hold to be the mean-\ning of the word as used in \u00a7203(o). Although a statute\nmay make \u201ca departure from the natural and popular\nacceptation of language,\u201d Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U. S.\n278, 284\u2013285 (1880) (citing Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How.\n251 (1854)), nothing in the text or context of \u00a7203(o) sug-\ngests anything other than the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cclothes.\u201d\n   Petitioners argue that the word \u201cclothes\u201d is too indeter-\nminate to be ascribed any general meaning but that,\nwhatever it includes, it necessarily excludes items de-\nsigned and used to protect against workplace hazards.\nThat position creates a distinction between \u201cprotection,\u201d\non the one hand, and \u201cdecency or comfort,\u201d on the other\u2014a\ndistinction that petitioners appear to have derived from\nWebster\u2019s Second, which elaborates that \u201cclothes\u201d is \u201ca\ngeneral term for whatever covering is worn, or is made to\nbe worn, for decency or comfort.\u201d Webster\u2019s Second 507\n(emphasis added). But that definition does not exclude,\neither explicitly or implicitly, items with a protective\nfunction, since \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201ccomfort\u201d are not incom-\npatible, and are often synonymous. A parasol protects\nagainst the sun, enhancing the comfort of the bearer\u2014just\nas work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts, enhanc-\ning the comfort of the wearer. Petitioners further assert\nthat protective items of apparel are referred to as \u201ccloth-\ning\u201d rather than \u201cclothes.\u201d They point out that, when\nintroduced by the adjective \u201cprotective,\u201d the noun \u201ccloth-\ning\u201d is used more commonly than \u201cclothes.\u201d That is true\nenough, but it seems to us explained by euphonic prefer-\nence rather than difference in meaning. We see no basis\nfor the proposition that the unmodified term \u201cclothes\u201d\nsomehow omits protective clothing.\n8         SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners\u2019 proffered distinction, moreover, runs the risk\nof reducing \u00a7203(o) to near nothingness. The statutory\ncompensation requirement to which \u00a7203(o) provides an\nexception embraces the changing of clothes only when that\nconduct constitutes \u201can integral and indispensable part of\nthe principal activities for which covered workmen are\nemployed.\u201d Steiner, 350 U. S., at 256. But protective gear\nis the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to\nthe work of factory workers, butchers, longshoremen, and\na host of other occupations. Petitioners\u2019 definition of\n\u201cclothes\u201d would largely limit the application of \u00a7203(o) to\nwhat might be called workers\u2019 costumes, worn by such\nemployees as waiters, doormen, and train conductors.\nPetitioners insist that their definition excludes only items\nwith some specific work-hazard-related protective func-\ntion, but that limitation essentially abandons the asser-\ntion that clothes are for decency or comfort, leaving no\nbasis whatever for the distinction.\n   Petitioners\u2019 position is also incompatible with the histor-\nical context surrounding \u00a7203(o)\u2019s passage, since it flatly\ncontradicts an illustration provided by the Labor Depart-\nment\u2019s 1947 regulations to show how \u201cchanging clothes\u201d\ncould be intimately related to a principal activity. See 29\nCFR \u00a7790.7, and n. 49. Those regulations cited the situa-\ntion in which \u201can employee in a chemical plant . . . cannot\nperform his [job] without putting on certain clothes\u201d and\nspecified that \u201c[s]uch a situation may exist where the\nchanging of clothes on the employer\u2019s premises is required\nby law, by rules of the employer, or by the nature of the\nwork.\u201d 12 Fed. Reg. 7660, and n. 65; 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(c),\nand n. 65. And petitioners\u2019 position contradicts this\nCourt\u2019s only prior opinion purporting to interpret \u00a7203(o).\nSteiner, announced less than a decade after the statute\u2019s\npassage, suggested in dictum that, were there a pertinent\nprovision of a collective-bargaining agreement, \u00a7203(o)\nwould have applied to the facts of that case\u2014where work-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ners \u201cma[d]e extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic\nmaterials, and [we]re compelled by circumstances, includ-\ning vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change\nclothes\u201d on the job site. 350 U. S., at 248, 254\u2013255.\n  Petitioners contend that any attempt at a general defi-\nnition of \u201cclothes\u201d will cast a net so vast as to capture all\nmanner of marginal things\u2014from bandoliers to barrettes\nto bandages. Yet even acknowledging that it may be\nimpossible to eliminate all vagueness when interpreting a\nword as wide-ranging as \u201cclothes,\u201d petitioners\u2019 fanciful\nhypotheticals give us little pause. The statutory context\nmakes clear that the \u201cclothes\u201d referred to are items that\nare integral to job performance; the donning and doffing of\nother items would create no claim to compensation under\nthe Act, and hence no need for the \u00a7203(o) exception.\nMoreover, even with respect to items that can be regarded\nas integral to job performance, our definition does not\nembrace the view, adopted by some Courts of Appeals,\nthat \u201cclothes\u201d means essentially anything worn on the\nbody\u2014including accessories, tools, and so forth. See, e.g.,\nSalazar v. Butterball, LLC, 644 F. 3d 1130, 1139\u20131140\n(CA10 2011) (\u201cclothes\u201d are \u201citems or garments worn by a\nperson\u201d and include \u201cknife holders\u201d). The construction\nwe adopt today is considerably more contained. Many\naccessories\u2014necklaces and knapsacks, for instance\u2014are not\n\u201cboth designed and used to cover the body.\u201d Nor are tools\n\u201ccommonly regarded as articles of dress.\u201d Our definition\nleaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wear-\nable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment\nand devices.6\n  Respondent and its amici, by contrast, give the term in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Petitioners and their amici insist that equipment can never be\n\nclothes. While we do not believe that every wearable piece of equip-\nment qualifies\u2014for example, a wristwatch\u2014our construction of\n\u201cclothes\u201d does not exclude all objects that could conceivably be charac-\nterized as equipment.\n10       SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion a capacious construction, effectively echoing the\nCourts of Appeals mentioned above.          On this view,\n\u201cclothes\u201d encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to\nbe ready for work. That interpretation is, to be sure, more\nreadily administrable, but it is even more devoid of a\ntextual foundation than petitioners\u2019 offering. Congress\ncould have declared bargainable under \u00a7203(o) \u201ctime spent\nin changing outfits,\u201d or \u201ctime spent in putting on and off\nall the items needed for work.\u201d For better or worse, it used\nthe narrower word \u201cclothes.\u201d \u201cThe role of this Court is to\napply the statute as it is written\u2014even if we think some\nother approach might accord with good policy.\u201d Burrage v.\nUnited States, ante at 14 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted).\n                          B. \u201cChanging\u201d\n    Having settled upon the meaning of \u201cclothes,\u201d we must\nnow consider the meaning of \u201cchanging.\u201d Petitioners\nassert that when used with certain objects\u2014such as \u201ctire,\u201d\n\u201cdiaper,\u201d or, indeed, \u201cclothes\u201d\u2014the term \u201cchanging\u201d connotes\nsubstitution. That is undoubtedly true. See Webster\u2019s\nSecond 448 (defining \u201cchange\u201d as \u201cto make substitution\nof, for, or among, often among things of the same kind\n. . . ; as, to change one\u2019s clothes\u201d). One would not normally\nsay he has changed clothes when he puts on an overcoat.\nPetitioners conclude from this that items of protective gear\nthat are put on over the employee\u2019s street clothes are not\ncovered by \u00a7203(o).\n    We disagree. Although it is true that the normal mean-\ning of \u201cchanging clothes\u201d connotes substitution, the phrase\nis certainly able to have a different import. The term\n\u201cchanging\u201d carried two common meanings at the time of\n\u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment: to \u201csubstitute\u201d and to \u201calter.\u201d See,\ne.g., 2 Oxford English Dictionary 268 (defining \u201cchange,\u201d\namong other verb forms, as \u201cto substitute another (or\nothers) for, replace by another (or others)\u201d and \u201c[t]o make\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(a thing) other than it was; to render different, alter,\nmodify, transmute\u201d). We think that despite the usual\nmeaning of \u201cchanging clothes,\u201d the broader statutory\ncontext makes it plain that \u201ctime spent in changing\nclothes\u201d includes time spent in altering dress.\n  The object of \u00a7203(o) is to permit collective bargaining\nover the compensability of clothes-changing time and to\npromote the predictability achieved through mutually\nbeneficial negotiation. There can be little predictability,\nand hence little meaningful negotiation, if \u201cchanging\u201d\nmeans only \u201csubstituting.\u201d Whether one actually ex-\nchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply layers\ngarments atop one another after arriving on the job site is\noften a matter of purely personal choice. That choice may\nbe influenced by such happenstances and vagaries as what\nmonth it is, what styles are in vogue, what time the em-\nployee wakes up, what mode of transportation he uses,\nand so on. As the Fourth Circuit has put it, if the statute\nimposed a substitution requirement \u201ccompensation for\nputting on a company-issued shirt might turn on some-\nthing as trivial as whether the employee did or did not\ntake off the t-shirt he wore into work that day.\u201d Sepulveda\nv. Allen Family Foods, Inc., 591 F. 3d 209, 216 (2009).\nWhere another reading is textually permissible, \u00a7203(o)\nshould not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its\ncoverage at random or at will.7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 This Court has stated that \u201cexemptions\u201d in the Fair Labor Stand-\n\nards Act \u201care to be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to\nassert them.\u201d Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S. 388, 392 (1960).\nWe need not disapprove that statement to resolve the present case.\nThe exemptions from the Act generally reside in \u00a7213, which is entitled\n\u201cExemptions\u201d and classifies certain kinds of workers as uncovered by\nvarious provisions. Thus, in Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n567 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___, n. 21 (2012) (slip op., at 19\u201320, n. 21), we de-\nclared the narrow-construction principle inapplicable to a provision\nappearing in \u00a7203, entitled \u201cDefinitions.\u201d\n12        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                        C. Application\n  Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this\ncase, we hold that petitioners\u2019 donning and doffing of the\nprotective gear at issue qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7203(o).\n  Petitioners have pointed to 12 particular items: a flame-\nretardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a\nsnood; wristlets; work gloves; leggings; metatarsal boots;\nsafety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator. The first nine\nclearly fit within the interpretation of \u201cclothes\u201d elaborated\nabove: they are both designed and used to cover the body\nand are commonly regarded as articles of dress. That\nproposition is obvious with respect to the jacket, pants,\nhood, and gloves. The hardhat is simply a type of hat.\nThe snood is basically a hood that also covers the neck and\nupper shoulder area; on the ski slopes, one might call it a\n\u201cbalaclava.\u201d The wristlets are essentially detached shirt-\nsleeves. The leggings look much like traditional legwarm-\ners, but with straps. And the metatarsal boots\u2014more\ncommonly known as \u201csteel-toed\u201d boots\u2014are just a special\nkind of shoe.\n  The remaining three items, by contrast, do not satisfy\nour standard. Whereas glasses and earplugs may have a\ncovering function, we do not believe that they are commonly\nregarded as articles of dress. And a respirator obviously\nfalls short on both grounds. The question is whether the\ntime devoted to the putting on and off of these items must\nbe deducted from the noncompensable time. If so, federal\njudges must be assigned the task of separating the\nminutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the\nminutes devoted to other activities during the period in\nquestion.\n  Some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals\nin this case, have sought to avoid, or at least mitigate, this\ndifficulty by invoking the doctrine de minimis non curat\nlex (the law does not take account of trifles). This, they\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhold, enables them to declare noncompensable a few\nminutes actually spent on something other than clothes-\nchanging\u2014to wit, donning and doffing non-clothes items.\n    Although the roots of the de minimis doctrine stretch to\nancient soil, its application in the present context began\nwith Anderson. There, the Court declared that because\n\u201c[s]plit-second absurdities are not justified by the actuali-\nties of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair\nLabor Standards Act,\u201d such \u201ctrifles\u201d as \u201ca few seconds or\nminutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours\u201d\nmay be \u201cdisregarded.\u201d 328 U. S., at 692. \u201cWe [thus] do not\n. . . preclude the application of a de minimis rule.\u201d Ibid.\n    We doubt that the de minimis doctrine can properly be\napplied to the present case. To be sure, Anderson included\n\u201cputting on aprons and overalls\u201d and \u201cremoving shirts\u201d as\nactivities to which \u201cit is appropriate to apply a de minimis\ndoctrine.\u201d Id., at 692\u2013693. It said that, however, in the\ncontext of determining what preliminary activities had to\nbe counted as part of the gross workweek under \u00a7207(a) of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.8 A de minimis doctrine\ndoes not fit comfortably within the statute at issue here,\nwhich, it can fairly be said, is all about trifles\u2014the rela-\ntively insignificant periods of time in which employees\nwash up and put on various items of clothing needed for\ntheir jobs. Or to put it in the context of the present case,\nthere is no more reason to disregard the minute or so\nnecessary to put on glasses, earplugs, and respirators,\nthan there is to regard the minute or so necessary to put\non a snood. If the statute in question requires courts to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 We note, moreover, that even in that context, the current regula-\n\ntions of the Labor Department apply a stricter de minimis standard\nthan Anderson expressed. They specify that \u201c[a]n employer may not\narbitrarily fail to count as hours worked any part, however small, of the\nemployee\u2019s fixed or regular working time or practically ascertainable\nperiod of time he is regularly required to spend on duties assigned to\nhim.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7785.47.\n14        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nselect among trifles, de minimis non curat lex is not Latin\nfor close enough for government work.\n   That said, we nonetheless agree with the basic percep-\ntion of the Courts of Appeals that it is most unlikely\nCongress meant \u00a7203(o) to convert federal judges into\ntime-study professionals. That is especially so since the conse-\nquence of dispensing with the intricate exercise of separat-\ning the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from\nthe minutes devoted to other activities is not to prevent\ncompensation for the uncovered segments, but merely to\nleave the issue of compensation to the process of collective\nbargaining. We think it is possible to give the text of\n\u00a7203(o) a meaning that avoids such relatively inconse-\nquential judicial involvement in \u201ca morass of difficult, fact-\nspecific determinations,\u201d Sepulveda, 591 F. 3d, at 218.\n   The forerunner of \u00a7203(o)\u2014the Portal-to-Portal Act\nprovision whose interpretation by the Labor Department\nprompted its enactment\u2014focused narrowly on the activi-\nties involved: \u201cactivities which are preliminary to or\npostliminary to [the employee\u2019s] principal activity or activ-\nities.\u201d \u00a7254(a)(2). Section 203(o), by contrast, is addressed\nnot to certain \u201cactivities,\u201d but to \u201ctime spent\u201d on certain\nactivities, viz., \u201cchanging clothes or washing.\u201d Just as one\ncan speak of \u201cspending the day skiing\u201d even when less-\nthan-negligible portions of the day are spent having lunch\nor drinking hot toddies, so also one can speak of \u201ctime\nspent changing clothes and washing\u201d when the vast pre-\nponderance of the period in question is devoted to those\nactivities. To be sure, such an imprecise and colloquial\nusage will not ordinarily be attributed to a statutory text,\nbut for the reasons we have discussed we think that ap-\npropriate here. The question for courts is whether the\nperiod at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as\n\u201ctime spent in changing clothes or washing.\u201d If an em-\nployee devotes the vast majority of the time in question to\nputting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                 15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(perhaps a diver\u2019s suit and tank) the entire period would\nnot qualify as \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d under\n\u00a7203(o), even if some clothes items were donned and doffed\nas well. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in\ndonning and doffing \u201cclothes\u201d as we have defined that\nterm, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent put-\nting on and off other items need not be subtracted.\n  In the present case, the District Court stated that \u201cthe\ntime expended by each employee donning and doffing\u201d\nsafety glasses and earplugs \u201cis minimal,\u201d 2009 WL\n3430222, *6, a conclusion with which the Seventh Circuit\nagreed, 678 F. 3d, at 593. As for respirators, the District\nCourt stated that they \u201care kept and put on as needed at\njob locations,\u201d 2009 WL 3430222, *2, which would render\nthe time spent donning and doffing them part of an em-\nployee\u2019s normal workday and thus beyond the scope of\n\u00a7203(o). The Seventh Circuit did not address respirators\nat all, and we are not inclined to disturb the District\nCourt\u2019s factual conclusion.\n                      *    *     * \n\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n\n\n                                                  It is so ordered.\n",

UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 12\u2013417.      Argued November 4, 2013\u2014Decided January 27, 2014\nPetitioner Sandifer and others filed a putative collective action under\n  the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking backpay for time spent\n  donning and doffing pieces of protective gear that they assert re-\n  spondent United States Steel Corporation requires workers to wear\n  because of hazards at its steel plants. U. S. Steel contends that this\n  donning-and-doffing time, which would otherwise be compensable\n  under the Act, is noncompensable under a provision of its collective-\n  bargaining agreement with petitioners\u2019 union. That provision\u2019s valid-\n  ity depends on 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(o), which allows parties to collectively\n  bargain over whether \u201ctime spent in changing clothes . . . at the be-\n  ginning or end of each workday\u201d must be compensated. The District\n  Court granted U. S. Steel summary judgment in pertinent part, hold-\n  ing that petitioners\u2019 donning and doffing constituted \u201cchanging\n  clothes\u201d under \u00a7203(o). It also assumed that any time spent donning\n  and doffing items that were not \u201cclothes\u201d was \u201cde minimis\u201d and hence\n  noncompensable. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The time petitioners spend donning and doffing their protective\n gear is not compensable by operation of \u00a7203(o). Pp. 3\u201315.\n    (a) This Court initially construed compensability under the Fair\n Labor Standards Act expansively. See, e.g., Anderson v. Mt. Clemens\n Pottery Co., 328 U. S. 680. The Act was amended in 1949, however,\n to provide that the compensability of time spent \u201cchanging clothes or\n washing at the beginning or end of each workday\u201d is a subject appro-\n priately committed to collective bargaining, \u00a7203(o). Whether peti-\n tioners\u2019 donning and doffing qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d depends\n on the meaning of that statutory phrase. Pp. 3\u20136.\n    (b) The term \u201cclothes,\u201d which is otherwise undefined, is \u201cinterpret-\n ed as taking [its] ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d Perrin\n2            SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42. In dictionaries from the era of\n    \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment, \u201cclothes\u201d denotes items that are both designed\n    and used to cover the body and are commonly regarded as articles of\n    dress. Nothing in \u00a7203(o)\u2019s text or context suggests anything other\n    than this ordinary meaning. There is no basis for petitioners\u2019 propo-\n    sition that the unmodified term \u201cclothes\u201d somehow omits protective\n    clothing. Section 203(o)\u2019s exception applies only when the changing\n    of clothes is \u201can integral and indispensable part of the principal activ-\n    ities for which covered workmen are employed,\u201d Steiner v. Mitchell,\n    350 U. S. 247, 256, and thus otherwise compensable under the Act.\n    See 29 U. S. C. \u00a7254(a). And protective gear is the only clothing that\n    is integral and indispensable to the work of many occupations, such\n    as butchers and longshoremen. Petitioners\u2019 position is also incompat-\n    ible with the historical context of \u00a7203(o)\u2019s passage, contradicting\n    contemporaneous Labor Department regulations and dictum in Stei-\n    ner, see 350 U. S., at 248, 254\u2013255. The interpretation adopted here\n    leaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wearable items\n    that are not clothes, such as some equipment and devices. The view\n    of respondent and its amici that \u201cclothes\u201d encompasses the entire out-\n    fit that one puts on to be ready for work is also devoid of any textual\n    foundation. Pp. 6\u201310.\n       (c) While the normal meaning of \u201cchanging clothes\u201d connotes sub-\n    stitution, \u201cchanging\u201d also carried the meaning to \u201calter\u201d at the time of\n    \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment. The broader statutory context makes plain that\n    \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d includes time spent in altering\n    dress. Whether one exchanges street clothes for work clothes or\n    simply chooses to layer one over the other may be a matter of purely\n    personal choice, and \u00a7203(o) should not be read to allow workers to\n    opt into or out of its coverage at random or at will when another\n    reading is textually permissible. Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (d) Applying these principles here, it is evident that the donning\n    and doffing in this case qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d under \u00a7203(o).\n    Of the 12 items at issue, only 3\u2014safety glasses, earplugs, and a res-\n    pirator\u2014do not fit within the elaborated interpretation of \u201cclothes.\u201d\n    Apparently concerned that federal judges would have to separate the\n    minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the minutes de-\n    voted to other activities during the relevant period, some Courts of\n    Appeals have invoked the doctrine de minimis non curat lex (the law\n    does not take account of trifles). But that doctrine does not fit com-\n    fortably within this statute, which is all about trifles. A more appro-\n    priate way to proceed is for courts to ask whether the period at issue\n    can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as \u201ctime spent in changing\n    clothes or washing.\u201d If an employee devotes the vast majority of that\n    time to putting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items, the\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  entire period would not qualify as \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d\n  under \u00a7203(o), even if some clothes items were also donned and\n  doffed. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in donning and\n  doffing \u201cclothes\u201d as defined here, the entire period qualifies, and the\n  time spent putting on and off other items need not be subtracted.\n  Here, the Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court\u2019s conclusion\n  that the time spent donning and doffing safety glasses and earplugs\n  was minimal. And this Court is disinclined to disturb the District\n  Court\u2019s additional factual finding, not addressed by the Seventh Cir-\n  cuit, that the respirators were donned and doffed as needed during\n  the normal workday and thus fell beyond \u00a7203(o)\u2019s scope.

S. C.\n\u00a7201 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. V).\n              I. Facts and Procedural History\n  Petitioner Clifton Sandifer, among others, filed suit\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act against respondent\nUnited States Steel Corporation in the District Court for\nthe Northern District of Indiana. The plaintiffs in this\nputative collective action are a group of current or former\nemployees of respondent\u2019s steelmaking facilities.1 As\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR joins this opinion except as to footnote 7.\n   1 Petitioners filed this action under 29 U. S. C. \u00a7216(b), which estab-\n\nlishes a cause of action that may be maintained \u201cby any one or more\nemployees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employ-\nees similarly situated.\u201d Pending resolution of the instant summary-\njudgment dispute, a Magistrate Judge set aside a motion to certify the\nsuit as a collective action, see No. 2:07\u2013CV\u2013443 RM, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3430222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n*1, n. 1 (ND Ind., Oct. 15, 2009), but petitioners assert that their ranks\nare about 800 strong.\n2           SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nrelevant here, they seek backpay for time spent donning\nand doffing various pieces of protective gear. Petitioners\nassert that respondent requires workers to wear all of the\nitems because of hazards regularly encountered in steel\nplants.\n   Petitioners point specifically to 12 of what they state are\nthe most common kinds of required protective gear: a\nflame-retardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat;\na \u201csnood\u201d; \u201cwristlets\u201d; work gloves; leggings; \u201cmetatarsal\u201d\nboots; safety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator.2 At bot-\ntom, petitioners want to be paid for the time they have\nspent putting on and taking off those objects. In the ag-\ngregate, the amount of time\u2014and thus money\u2014involved is\nlikely to be quite large. Because this donning-and-doffing\ntime would otherwise be compensable under the Act, U. S.\nSteel\u2019s contention of noncompensability stands or falls\nupon the validity of a provision of its collective-bargaining\nagreement with petitioners\u2019 union, which says that this\ntime is noncompensable.3 The validity of that provision\ndepends, in turn, upon the applicability of 29 U. S. C.\n\u00a7203(o) to the time at issue. That subsection allows par-\nties to decide, as part of a collective-bargaining agreement,\nthat \u201ctime spent in changing clothes . . . at the beginning\nor end of each workday\u201d is noncompensable.\n   The District Court granted summary judgment in perti-\nnent part to U. S. Steel, holding that donning and doffing\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 The\n        opinions below include descriptions of some of the items.

Legal Background\n   The Fair Labor Standards Act, enacted in 1938, governs\nminimum wages and maximum hours for non-exempt\n\u201cemployees who in any workweek [are] engaged in com-\nmerce or in the production of goods for commerce, or [are]\nemployed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the\nproduction of goods for commerce.\u201d 29 U. S. C. \u00a7206(a)\n(minimum wages); \u00a7207(a) (maximum hours); see \u00a7213\n(exemptions). The Act provides that \u201cemployee\u201d generally\nmeans \u201cany individual employed by an employer,\u201d\n\u00a7203(e)(1), and, in turn, provides that to \u201cemploy\u201d is \u201cto\nsuffer or permit to work,\u201d \u00a7203(g).\n   The Act did not, however, define the key terms \u201cwork\u201d\nand \u201cworkweek\u201d\u2014an omission that soon let loose a land-\nslide of litigation. See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21,\n25\u201326 (2005). This Court gave those terms a broad read-\ning, culminating in its holding in Anderson v. Mt. Clemens\nPottery Co., 328 U. S. 680 (1946), that \u201cthe statutory\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  4 Petitioners also sought, inter alia, backpay for time spent traveling\n\nbetween the locker rooms where they don and doff at least some of the\nprotective gear and their workstations. The District Court denied that\nportion of respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3430222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *11, and the Seventh Circuit reversed, 678 F. 3d, at 595\u2013598.\nThat issue is not before this Court, so we express no opinion on it.\n4        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nworkweek includes all time during which an employee is\nnecessarily required to be on the employer\u2019s premises, on\nduty or at a prescribed workplace.\u201d Id., at 690\u2013691. That\nperiod, Anderson explained, encompassed time spent\n\u201cpursu[ing] certain preliminary activities after arriving\n. . . , such as putting on aprons and overalls [and] remov-\ning shirts.\u201d Id., at 692\u2013693. \u201cThese activities,\u201d the Court\ndeclared, \u201care clearly work\u201d under the Act. Id., at 693.\n    Organized labor seized on the Court\u2019s expansive con-\nstruction of compensability by filing what became known\nas \u201cportal\u201d actions (a reference to the \u201cportals\u201d or entranc-\nes to mines, at which workers put on their gear).\n\u201cPORTAL PAY SUITS EXCEED A BILLION,\u201d announced\na newspaper headline in late 1946. N. Y. Times, Dec. 29,\n1946, p. 1. Stating that the Fair Labor Standards Act\nhad been \u201cinterpreted judicially in disregard of long-\nestablished customs, practices, and contracts between\nemployers and employees,\u201d Congress responded by passing\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 84, as amended,\n29 U. S. C. \u00a7251 et seq. (2006 ed. and Supp. V). \u00a7251(a).\n    The Portal-to-Portal Act limited the scope of employers\u2019\nliability in various ways. As relevant here, it excluded\nfrom mandatorily compensable time\n    \u201cactivities which are preliminary to or postliminary to\n    [the] principal activity or activities [that an employee\n    is employed to perform], which occur either prior to\n    the time on any particular workday at which such\n    employee commences, or subsequent to the time on\n    any particular workday at which he ceases, such prin-\n    cipal activity or activities.\u201d 61 Stat. 87, 29 U.

Of particular importance to this case, a Labor\nDepartment interpretive bulletin also specified that\nwhereas \u201cchanging clothes\u201d and \u201cwashing up or shower-\ning\u201d \u201cwould be considered \u2018preliminary\u2019 or \u2018postliminary\u2019\nactivities\u201d when \u201cperformed outside the workday and . . .\nunder the conditions normally present,\u201d those same activi-\nties \u201cmay in certain situations be so directly related to the\nspecific work the employee is employed to perform that\n[they] would be regarded as an integral part of the em-\nployee\u2019s \u2018principal activity.\u2019 \u201d 12 Fed. Reg. 7659, and n. 49;\n29 CFR \u00a7790.7, and n. 49.\n   In 1949, Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards\nAct to address the conduct discussed in that interpretive\nbulletin\u2014changing clothes and washing\u2014by adding the\nprovision presently at issue:\n    \u201cHours Worked.\u2014In determining for the purposes of\n    [the minimum-wage and maximum-hours sections] of\n    this title the hours for which an employee is em-\n    ployed, there shall be excluded any time spent in\n    changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n    of each workday which was excluded from measured\n    working time during the week involved by the express\n    terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide\n    collective-bargaining agreement applicable to the par-\n    ticular employee.\u201d 63 Stat. 911, 29 U. S. C. \u00a7203(o).\nSimply put, the statute provides that the compensability\nof time spent changing clothes or washing is a subject\nappropriately committed to collective bargaining.\n  In Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247 (1956), the Court\nechoed the Labor Department\u2019s 1947 regulations by hold-\ning that \u201cchanging clothes and showering\u201d can, under\n6            SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nsome circumstances, be considered \u201can integral and indis-\npensable part of the principal activities for which covered\nworkmen are employed,\u201d reasoning that \u00a7203(o) \u201cclear[ly]\nimpli[ed]\u201d as much. Id., at 254\u2013256. And in IBP, we\napplied Steiner to treat as compensable the donning and\ndoffing of protective gear somewhat similar to that at\nissue here, 546 U. S., at 30. We said that \u201cany activity\nthat is \u2018integral and indispensable\u2019 to a \u2018principal activity\u2019\nis itself a \u2018principal activity\u2019 \u201d under \u00a7254(a), id., at 37.\n   As relevant to the question before us, U. S. Steel does\nnot dispute the Seventh Circuit\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[h]ad\nthe clothes-changing time in this case not been rendered\nnoncompensable pursuant to [\u00a7]203(o), it would have been\na principal activity.\u201d 678 F. 3d, at 596. Petitioners, how-\never, quarrel with the premise, arguing that the donning\nand doffing of protective gear does not qualify as \u201cchang-\ning clothes.\u201d\n                        III. Analysis\n                        A. \u201cClothes\u201d\n   We begin by examining the meaning of the word\n\u201cclothes.\u201d5 It is a \u201cfundamental canon of statutory con-\nstruction\u201d that, \u201cunless otherwise defined, words will be\ninterpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, com-\nmon meaning.\u201d Perrin v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42\n(1979).\n   Dictionaries from the era of \u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment indicate\nthat \u201cclothes\u201d denotes items that are both designed and\nused to cover the body and are commonly regarded as\narticles of dress. See Webster\u2019s New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 507 (2d ed. 1950) (Web-\nster\u2019s Second) (defining \u201cclothes\u201d as \u201c[c]overing for the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    5 Althoughthe Labor Department has construed \u00a7203(o) on a number\nof occasions, the Government has expressly declined to ask us to defer\nto those interpretations, which have vacillated considerably over the\nyears.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

That is what we hold to be the mean-\ning of the word as used in \u00a7203(o). Although a statute\nmay make \u201ca departure from the natural and popular\nacceptation of language,\u201d Greenleaf v. Goodrich, 101 U. S.\n278, 284\u2013285 (1880) (citing Maillard v.

But that definition does not exclude,\neither explicitly or implicitly, items with a protective\nfunction, since \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201ccomfort\u201d are not incom-\npatible, and are often synonymous. A parasol protects\nagainst the sun, enhancing the comfort of the bearer\u2014just\nas work gloves protect against scrapes and cuts, enhanc-\ning the comfort of the wearer. Petitioners further assert\nthat protective items of apparel are referred to as \u201ccloth-\ning\u201d rather than \u201cclothes.\u201d They point out that, when\nintroduced by the adjective \u201cprotective,\u201d the noun \u201ccloth-\ning\u201d is used more commonly than \u201cclothes.\u201d That is true\nenough, but it seems to us explained by euphonic prefer-\nence rather than difference in meaning. We see no basis\nfor the proposition that the unmodified term \u201cclothes\u201d\nsomehow omits protective clothing.\n8         SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n   Petitioners\u2019 proffered distinction, moreover, runs the risk\nof reducing \u00a7203(o) to near nothingness. The statutory\ncompensation requirement to which \u00a7203(o) provides an\nexception embraces the changing of clothes only when that\nconduct constitutes \u201can integral and indispensable part of\nthe principal activities for which covered workmen are\nemployed.\u201d Steiner, 350 U. S., at 256. But protective gear\nis the only clothing that is integral and indispensable to\nthe work of factory workers, butchers, longshoremen, and\na host of other occupations. Petitioners\u2019 definition of\n\u201cclothes\u201d would largely limit the application of \u00a7203(o) to\nwhat might be called workers\u2019 costumes, worn by such\nemployees as waiters, doormen, and train conductors.\nPetitioners insist that their definition excludes only items\nwith some specific work-hazard-related protective func-\ntion, but that limitation essentially abandons the asser-\ntion that clothes are for decency or comfort, leaving no\nbasis whatever for the distinction.\n   Petitioners\u2019 position is also incompatible with the histor-\nical context surrounding \u00a7203(o)\u2019s passage, since it flatly\ncontradicts an illustration provided by the Labor Depart-\nment\u2019s 1947 regulations to show how \u201cchanging clothes\u201d\ncould be intimately related to a principal activity. See 29\nCFR \u00a7790.7, and n. 49. Those regulations cited the situa-\ntion in which \u201can employee in a chemical plant . . . cannot\nperform his [job] without putting on certain clothes\u201d and\nspecified that \u201c[s]uch a situation may exist where the\nchanging of clothes on the employer\u2019s premises is required\nby law, by rules of the employer, or by the nature of the\nwork.\u201d 12 Fed. Reg. 7660, and n. 65; 29 CFR \u00a7790.8(c),\nand n. 65. And petitioners\u2019 position contradicts this\nCourt\u2019s only prior opinion purporting to interpret \u00a7203(o).\nSteiner, announced less than a decade after the statute\u2019s\npassage, suggested in dictum that, were there a pertinent\nprovision of a collective-bargaining agreement, \u00a7203(o)\nwould have applied to the facts of that case\u2014where work-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ners \u201cma[d]e extensive use of dangerously caustic and toxic\nmaterials, and [we]re compelled by circumstances, includ-\ning vital considerations of health and hygiene, to change\nclothes\u201d on the job site. 350 U. S., at 248, 254\u2013255.\n  Petitioners contend that any attempt at a general defi-\nnition of \u201cclothes\u201d will cast a net so vast as to capture all\nmanner of marginal things\u2014from bandoliers to barrettes\nto bandages. Yet even acknowledging that it may be\nimpossible to eliminate all vagueness when interpreting a\nword as wide-ranging as \u201cclothes,\u201d petitioners\u2019 fanciful\nhypotheticals give us little pause. The statutory context\nmakes clear that the \u201cclothes\u201d referred to are items that\nare integral to job performance; the donning and doffing of\nother items would create no claim to compensation under\nthe Act, and hence no need for the \u00a7203(o) exception.\nMoreover, even with respect to items that can be regarded\nas integral to job performance, our definition does not\nembrace the view, adopted by some Courts of Appeals,\nthat \u201cclothes\u201d means essentially anything worn on the\nbody\u2014including accessories, tools, and so forth. See, e.g.,\nSalazar v. Butterball, LLC, 644 F. 3d 1130, 1139\u20131140\n(CA10 2011) (\u201cclothes\u201d are \u201citems or garments worn by a\nperson\u201d and include \u201cknife holders\u201d). The construction\nwe adopt today is considerably more contained. Many\naccessories\u2014necklaces and knapsacks, for instance\u2014are not\n\u201cboth designed and used to cover the body.\u201d Nor are tools\n\u201ccommonly regarded as articles of dress.\u201d Our definition\nleaves room for distinguishing between clothes and wear-\nable items that are not clothes, such as some equipment\nand devices.6\n  Respondent and its amici, by contrast, give the term in\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   6 Petitioners and their amici insist that equipment can never be\n\nclothes. While we do not believe that every wearable piece of equip-\nment qualifies\u2014for example, a wristwatch\u2014our construction of\n\u201cclothes\u201d does not exclude all objects that could conceivably be charac-\nterized as equipment.\n10       SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nquestion a capacious construction, effectively echoing the\nCourts of Appeals mentioned above.          On this view,\n\u201cclothes\u201d encompasses the entire outfit that one puts on to\nbe ready for work. That interpretation is, to be sure, more\nreadily administrable, but it is even more devoid of a\ntextual foundation than petitioners\u2019 offering. Congress\ncould have declared bargainable under \u00a7203(o) \u201ctime spent\nin changing outfits,\u201d or \u201ctime spent in putting on and off\nall the items needed for work.\u201d For better or worse, it used\nthe narrower word \u201cclothes.\u201d \u201cThe role of this Court is to\napply the statute as it is written\u2014even if we think some\nother approach might accord with good policy.\u201d Burrage v.\nUnited States, ante at 14 (internal quotation marks and\nbrackets omitted).\n                          B. \u201cChanging\u201d\n    Having settled upon the meaning of \u201cclothes,\u201d we must\nnow consider the meaning of \u201cchanging.\u201d Petitioners\nassert that when used with certain objects\u2014such as \u201ctire,\u201d\n\u201cdiaper,\u201d or, indeed, \u201cclothes\u201d\u2014the term \u201cchanging\u201d connotes\nsubstitution. That is undoubtedly true. See Webster\u2019s\nSecond 448 (defining \u201cchange\u201d as \u201cto make substitution\nof, for, or among, often among things of the same kind\n. . . ; as, to change one\u2019s clothes\u201d). One would not normally\nsay he has changed clothes when he puts on an overcoat.\nPetitioners conclude from this that items of protective gear\nthat are put on over the employee\u2019s street clothes are not\ncovered by \u00a7203(o).\n    We disagree. Although it is true that the normal mean-\ning of \u201cchanging clothes\u201d connotes substitution, the phrase\nis certainly able to have a different import. The term\n\u201cchanging\u201d carried two common meanings at the time of\n\u00a7203(o)\u2019s enactment: to \u201csubstitute\u201d and to \u201calter.\u201d See,\ne.g., 2 Oxford English Dictionary 268 (defining \u201cchange,\u201d\namong other verb forms, as \u201cto substitute another (or\nothers) for, replace by another (or others)\u201d and \u201c[t]o make\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n(a thing) other than it was; to render different, alter,\nmodify, transmute\u201d). We think that despite the usual\nmeaning of \u201cchanging clothes,\u201d the broader statutory\ncontext makes it plain that \u201ctime spent in changing\nclothes\u201d includes time spent in altering dress.\n  The object of \u00a7203(o) is to permit collective bargaining\nover the compensability of clothes-changing time and to\npromote the predictability achieved through mutually\nbeneficial negotiation. There can be little predictability,\nand hence little meaningful negotiation, if \u201cchanging\u201d\nmeans only \u201csubstituting.\u201d Whether one actually ex-\nchanges street clothes for work clothes or simply layers\ngarments atop one another after arriving on the job site is\noften a matter of purely personal choice. That choice may\nbe influenced by such happenstances and vagaries as what\nmonth it is, what styles are in vogue, what time the em-\nployee wakes up, what mode of transportation he uses,\nand so on. As the Fourth Circuit has put it, if the statute\nimposed a substitution requirement \u201ccompensation for\nputting on a company-issued shirt might turn on some-\nthing as trivial as whether the employee did or did not\ntake off the t-shirt he wore into work that day.\u201d Sepulveda\nv. Allen Family Foods, Inc., 591 F. 3d 209, 216 (2009).\nWhere another reading is textually permissible, \u00a7203(o)\nshould not be read to allow workers to opt into or out of its\ncoverage at random or at will.7\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 This Court has stated that \u201cexemptions\u201d in the Fair Labor Stand-\n\nards Act \u201care to be narrowly construed against the employers seeking to\nassert them.\u201d Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., 361 U. S. 388, 392 (1960).\nWe need not disapprove that statement to resolve the present case.\nThe exemptions from the Act generally reside in \u00a7213, which is entitled\n\u201cExemptions\u201d and classifies certain kinds of workers as uncovered by\nvarious provisions. Thus, in Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,\n567 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___, n. 21 (2012) (slip op., at 19\u201320, n. 21), we de-\nclared the narrow-construction principle inapplicable to a provision\nappearing in \u00a7203, entitled \u201cDefinitions.\u201d\n12        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                        C. Application\n  Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this\ncase, we hold that petitioners\u2019 donning and doffing of the\nprotective gear at issue qualifies as \u201cchanging clothes\u201d\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7203(o).\n  Petitioners have pointed to 12 particular items: a flame-\nretardant jacket, pair of pants, and hood; a hardhat; a\nsnood; wristlets; work gloves; leggings; metatarsal boots;\nsafety glasses; earplugs; and a respirator. The first nine\nclearly fit within the interpretation of \u201cclothes\u201d elaborated\nabove: they are both designed and used to cover the body\nand are commonly regarded as articles of dress. That\nproposition is obvious with respect to the jacket, pants,\nhood, and gloves. The hardhat is simply a type of hat.\nThe snood is basically a hood that also covers the neck and\nupper shoulder area; on the ski slopes, one might call it a\n\u201cbalaclava.\u201d The wristlets are essentially detached shirt-\nsleeves. The leggings look much like traditional legwarm-\ners, but with straps. And the metatarsal boots\u2014more\ncommonly known as \u201csteel-toed\u201d boots\u2014are just a special\nkind of shoe.\n  The remaining three items, by contrast, do not satisfy\nour standard. Whereas glasses and earplugs may have a\ncovering function, we do not believe that they are commonly\nregarded as articles of dress. And a respirator obviously\nfalls short on both grounds. The question is whether the\ntime devoted to the putting on and off of these items must\nbe deducted from the noncompensable time. If so, federal\njudges must be assigned the task of separating the\nminutes spent clothes-changing and washing from the\nminutes devoted to other activities during the period in\nquestion.\n  Some Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals\nin this case, have sought to avoid, or at least mitigate, this\ndifficulty by invoking the doctrine de minimis non curat\nlex (the law does not take account of trifles). This, they\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nhold, enables them to declare noncompensable a few\nminutes actually spent on something other than clothes-\nchanging\u2014to wit, donning and doffing non-clothes items.\n    Although the roots of the de minimis doctrine stretch to\nancient soil, its application in the present context began\nwith Anderson. There, the Court declared that because\n\u201c[s]plit-second absurdities are not justified by the actuali-\nties of working conditions or by the policy of the Fair\nLabor Standards Act,\u201d such \u201ctrifles\u201d as \u201ca few seconds or\nminutes of work beyond the scheduled working hours\u201d\nmay be \u201cdisregarded.\u201d 328 U. S., at 692. \u201cWe [thus] do not\n. . . preclude the application of a de minimis rule.\u201d Ibid.\n    We doubt that the de minimis doctrine can properly be\napplied to the present case. To be sure, Anderson included\n\u201cputting on aprons and overalls\u201d and \u201cremoving shirts\u201d as\nactivities to which \u201cit is appropriate to apply a de minimis\ndoctrine.\u201d Id., at 692\u2013693. It said that, however, in the\ncontext of determining what preliminary activities had to\nbe counted as part of the gross workweek under \u00a7207(a) of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act.8 A de minimis doctrine\ndoes not fit comfortably within the statute at issue here,\nwhich, it can fairly be said, is all about trifles\u2014the rela-\ntively insignificant periods of time in which employees\nwash up and put on various items of clothing needed for\ntheir jobs. Or to put it in the context of the present case,\nthere is no more reason to disregard the minute or so\nnecessary to put on glasses, earplugs, and respirators,\nthan there is to regard the minute or so necessary to put\non a snood. If the statute in question requires courts to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   8 We note, moreover, that even in that context, the current regula-\n\ntions of the Labor Department apply a stricter de minimis standard\nthan Anderson expressed. They specify that \u201c[a]n employer may not\narbitrarily fail to count as hours worked any part, however small, of the\nemployee\u2019s fixed or regular working time or practically ascertainable\nperiod of time he is regularly required to spend on duties assigned to\nhim.\u201d 29 CFR \u00a7785.47.\n14        SANDIFER v. UNITED STATES STEEL CORP.\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nselect among trifles, de minimis non curat lex is not Latin\nfor close enough for government work.\n   That said, we nonetheless agree with the basic percep-\ntion of the Courts of Appeals that it is most unlikely\nCongress meant \u00a7203(o) to convert federal judges into\ntime-study professionals. That is especially so since the conse-\nquence of dispensing with the intricate exercise of separat-\ning the minutes spent clothes-changing and washing from\nthe minutes devoted to other activities is not to prevent\ncompensation for the uncovered segments, but merely to\nleave the issue of compensation to the process of collective\nbargaining. We think it is possible to give the text of\n\u00a7203(o) a meaning that avoids such relatively inconse-\nquential judicial involvement in \u201ca morass of difficult, fact-\nspecific determinations,\u201d Sepulveda, 591 F. 3d, at 218.\n   The forerunner of \u00a7203(o)\u2014the Portal-to-Portal Act\nprovision whose interpretation by the Labor Department\nprompted its enactment\u2014focused narrowly on the activi-\nties involved: \u201cactivities which are preliminary to or\npostliminary to [the employee\u2019s] principal activity or activ-\nities.\u201d \u00a7254(a)(2). Section 203(o), by contrast, is addressed\nnot to certain \u201cactivities,\u201d but to \u201ctime spent\u201d on certain\nactivities, viz., \u201cchanging clothes or washing.\u201d Just as one\ncan speak of \u201cspending the day skiing\u201d even when less-\nthan-negligible portions of the day are spent having lunch\nor drinking hot toddies, so also one can speak of \u201ctime\nspent changing clothes and washing\u201d when the vast pre-\nponderance of the period in question is devoted to those\nactivities. To be sure, such an imprecise and colloquial\nusage will not ordinarily be attributed to a statutory text,\nbut for the reasons we have discussed we think that ap-\npropriate here. The question for courts is whether the\nperiod at issue can, on the whole, be fairly characterized as\n\u201ctime spent in changing clothes or washing.\u201d If an em-\nployee devotes the vast majority of the time in question to\nputting on and off equipment or other non-clothes items\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                 15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(perhaps a diver\u2019s suit and tank) the entire period would\nnot qualify as \u201ctime spent in changing clothes\u201d under\n\u00a7203(o), even if some clothes items were donned and doffed\nas well. But if the vast majority of the time is spent in\ndonning and doffing \u201cclothes\u201d as we have defined that\nterm, the entire period qualifies, and the time spent put-\nting on and off other items need not be subtracted.\n  In the present case, the District Court stated that \u201cthe\ntime expended by each employee donning and doffing\u201d\nsafety glasses and earplugs \u201cis minimal,\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3430222</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6, a conclusion with which the Seventh Circuit\nagreed, 678 F. 3d, at 593.
