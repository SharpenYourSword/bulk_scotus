UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 12–7515. Argued November 12, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014\nLong-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that in-\n  cluded using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage\n  pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,\n  that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that “death . . . result-\n  ed from the use of th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to a\n  20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhance-\n  ment provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.\n  §841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka\n  might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved\n  for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka’s death could only\n  “result from” heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-\n  for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant\n  here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that\n  heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Bur-\n  rage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the\n  Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court’s jury instruction.\nHeld: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not\n an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s death or serious bod-\n ily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement un-\n der §841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or in-\n jury. Pp. 4–15.\n     (a) Section 841(b)(1)(C)’s “death results” enhancement, which in-\n creased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\n exposed, is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found\n beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570\n U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.\n    (b) Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define “results\n from,” the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\n2                     BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. Ordinarily, that phrase\n    imposes a requirement of actual causality, i.e., proof “ ‘that the harm\n    would not have occurred’ in the absence of—that is, but for—the de-\n    fendant’s conduct.” University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center\n    v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___. Similar statutory phrases—“because\n    of,” see id., at ___, “ ‘based on,’ ” Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,\n    551 U. S. 47, 63, and “ ‘by reason of,’ ” Gross v. FBL Financial Ser-\n    vices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176—have been read to impose a but-for\n    causation requirement. This Court declines to adopt the Govern-\n    ment’s permissive interpretation of “results from” to mean that use of\n    a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggre-\n    gate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause\n    of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for\n    cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concur-\n    rently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka’s hero-\n    in use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And\n    though Congress could have written §841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or\n    omission a cause-in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” fac-\n    tor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that\n    imports but-for causality. Pp. 6–12.\n       (c) Whether adopting the but-for causation requirement or the\n    Government’s interpretation raises policy concerns is beside the\n    point, for the Court’s role is to apply the statute as written.

S. C. §841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)–(C) (2012 ed.). We consider\nwhether the mandatory-minimum provision applies when\nuse of a covered drug supplied by the defendant contrib­\nutes to, but is not a but-for cause of, the victim’s death or\ninjury.\n                             I\n  Joshua Banka, a long-time drug user, died on April 15,\n2010, following an extended drug binge. The episode\nbegan on the morning of April 14, when Banka smoked\nmarijuana at a former roommate’s home. Banka stole\noxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and\nlater crushed, cooked, and injected the oxycodone. Banka\nand his wife, Tammy Noragon Banka (Noragon), then met\nwith petitioner Marcus Burrage and purchased one gram\n——————\n *JUSTICE ALITO joins all but Part III–B of this opinion.\n2               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof heroin from him. Banka immediately cooked and in­\njected some of the heroin and, after returning home, in­\njected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April\n15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after\nwitnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When\nNoragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead\nin the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple’s\nhome and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,\nalprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a\nbottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\n   Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment\nalleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of\n§841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at\nissue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of\nheroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2\nalleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on\nApril 14, 2010, and that “death . . . resulted from the use\nof th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to the 20­\nyear mandatory minimum of §841(b)(1)(C).\n   Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the\ncause of Banka’s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic\ntoxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present\nin Banka’s system at the time of his death, including\nheroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-\nolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a “product of\nmetabolism,” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it,\n“what a drug breaks down into in the body,” 687 F. 3d\n1015, 1018, n. 2 (CA8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin\nmetabolite, was the only drug present at a level above\nthe therapeutic range—i.e., the concentration normally\npresent when a person takes a drug as prescribed—Dr.\nSchwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived\nhad he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless\nconcluded that heroin “was a contributing factor” in\nBanka’s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The heroin, in other words, contributed\nto an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.\nDr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner,\ncame to similar conclusions. She described the cause of\ndeath as “mixed drug intoxication” with heroin, oxycodone,\nalprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a “contributing”\nrole. Id., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether\nBanka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but\nobserved that Banka’s death would have been “[v]ery less\nlikely.” Id., at 171.\n   The District Court denied Burrage’s motion for a judg­\nment of acquittal, which argued that Banka’s death did\nnot “result from” heroin use because there was no evidence\nthat heroin was a but-for cause of death. Id., at 30. The\ncourt also declined to give Burrage’s proposed jury instruc­\ntions regarding causation. One of those instructions\nwould have required the Government to prove that heroin\nuse “was the proximate cause of [Banka’s] death.” Id., at\n236. Another would have defined proximate cause as\n“a cause of death that played a substantial part in bring­\ning about the death,” meaning that “[t]he death must\nhave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable\nconsequence of the cause and except for the cause the\ndeath would not have occurred.” Id., at 238. The court\ninstead gave an instruction requiring the Government to\nprove “that the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a\ncontributing cause of Joshua Banka’s death.” Id., at 241–\n242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the\ncourt sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment, consistent\nwith §841(b)(1)(C)’s prescribed minimum.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed\nBurrage’s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015. As to the causation­\nin-fact element of count 2, the court held that the\nDistrict Court’s contributing-cause instruction was con­\nsistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Mon-\n4                   BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnier, 412 F. 3d 859, 862 (CA8 2005). See 687 F. 3d, at\n1021. As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage’s\nproposed instructions “d[id] not correctly state the law”\nbecause “a showing of ‘proximate cause’ is not required.”\nId., at 1020 (quoting United States v. McIntosh, 236 F. 3d\n968, 972–973 (CA8 2001)).\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: Whether the\ndefendant may be convicted under the “death results” pro­\nvision (1) when the use of the controlled substance was a\n“contributing cause” of the death, and (2) without sepa­\nrately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the\nvictim’s death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of\nthe defendant’s drug-trafficking offense. 569 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                              II\n   As originally enacted, the Controlled Substances Act, 84\nStat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq., “tied the penalties for\ndrug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity\ninvolved, with no provision for mandatory minimum sen­\ntences.” DePierre v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 3–4). That changed in 1986 when\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 100 Stat.\n3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the\nmaximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many\noffenders, including the “death results” enhancement at\nissue here. See id., at 3207–4. With respect to violations\ninvolving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the\ntypes of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addic­\ntive1) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to\n——————\n  1 Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have “a high potential for abuse,”\n\n“no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates,” and “a lack of accepted safety” even “under medical supervision.”\n§812(b)(1). Schedule II drugs, such as methamphetamine, likewise\nhave “a high potential for abuse” and a propensity to cause “severe\npsychological or physical dependence” if misused. 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(2).\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlife imprisonment for large-scale distributions, §841(b)\n(1)(A), from 5 to 40 years for medium-scale distribu­\ntions, §841(b)(1)(B), and not more than 20 years for\nsmaller distributions, §841(b)(1)(C), the type of offense at\nissue here. These default sentencing rules do not apply,\nhowever, when “death or serious bodily injury results from\nthe use of [the distributed] substance.” §841(b)(1)(A)–(C).\nIn those instances, the defendant “shall be sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than\ntwenty years or more than life,” a substantial fine, “or\nboth.”2 Ibid.\n   Because the “death results” enhancement increased the\nminimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\nexposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See Alleyne v.\nUnited States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14–15);\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Thus,\nthe crime charged in count 2 of Burrage’s superseding\nindictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or\nintentional distribution of heroin, §841(a)(1),3 and (ii)\ndeath caused by (“resulting from”) the use of that drug,\n§841(b)(1)(C).\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may\n\nimpose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the “death\nresults” provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have\nconcluded, in effect, that the “or” is a scrivener’s error, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The\nbest evidence of that is the concluding sentence of §841(b)(1)(C), which\nstates that a court “shall not place on probation or suspend the sen­\ntence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara­\ngraph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or\nserious bodily injury results.” (Emphasis added.)\n  3 Violation of §841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime\n\ncharged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that\nlesser included offense.\n6               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n    The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,\nconsisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal\ncause. H. Hart & A. Honoré, Causation in the Law 104\n(1959). When a crime requires “not merely conduct but\nalso a specified result of conduct,” a defendant generally\nmay not be convicted unless his conduct is “both (1) the\nactual cause, and (2) the ‘legal’ cause (often called the\n‘proximate cause’) of the result.” 1 W. LaFave, Substan­\ntive Criminal Law §6.4(a), pp. 464–466 (2d ed. 2003) (here­\ninafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code §2.03,\np. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with\nthe two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find\nit necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of\nheroin was the actual cause of Banka’s death in the sense\nthat §841(b)(1)(C) requires.\n    The Controlled Substances Act does not define the\nphrase “results from,” so we give it its ordinary meaning.\nSee Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995). A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect,\nissue, or outcome from some action, process or design.”\n2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).\n“Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of\nactual causality. “In the usual course,” this requires proof\n“ ‘that the harm would not have occurred’ in the absence\nof—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Restatement of\nTorts §431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code\nreflects this traditional understanding; it states that\n“[c]onduct is the cause of a result” if “it is an antecedent\nbut for which the result in question would not have oc­\ncurred.” §2.03(1)(a). That formulation represents “the\nminimum requirement for a finding of causation when a\ncrime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult.” Id., Explanatory Note (emphasis added); see also\nUnited States v. Hatfield, 591 F. 3d 945, 948 (CA7 2010)\n(but for “is the minimum concept of cause”); Callahan v.\nCardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862 (Mo.\n1993) (same).\n   Thus, “where A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say\nthat A [actually] caused B’s death, since but for A’s con­\nduct B would not have died.” LaFave 467–468 (italics\nomitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act\ncombines with other factors to produce the result, so long\nas the other factors alone would not have done so—if, so to\nspeak, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Thus,\nif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those\ndiseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without\nthe incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\nSee, e.g., State v. Frazier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mo.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974–975, 98 S. W.\n2d 707, 712–713 (1936).\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common under­\nstanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the\nvisiting team’s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of\nthe first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a\nscore of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English\nlanguage and familiar with the American pastime would\nagree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is\nso because it is natural to say that one event is the out­\ncome or consequence of another when the former would\nnot have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point\nthat the victory also resulted from a host of other neces­\nsary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach’s decision\nto put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league’s\ndecision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little\nsense to say that an event resulted from or was the out­\ncome of some earlier action if the action merely played a\nnonessential contributing role in producing the event. If\nthe visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than\n8                BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page\nthat the victory resulted from the leadoff batter’s early,\nnon-dispositive home run.\n  Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the\ncontrary, courts regularly read phrases like “results from”\nto require but-for causality. Our interpretation of statutes\nthat prohibit adverse employment action “because of ” an\nemployee’s age or complaints about unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed\nTitle VII’s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:\n    “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer . . . to discriminate against any individual\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an un­\n    lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or be-\n    cause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42\n    U. S. C. §2000e–3(a) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\nGiven the ordinary meaning of the word “because,” we\nheld that §2000e–3(a) “require[s] proof that the desire to\nretaliate was [a] but-for cause of the challenged employ­\nment action.” Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).\nThe same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a\nprovision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\nthat makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi­\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi­\nvidual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nRelying on dictionary definitions of “[t]he words ‘because\nof ’ ”—which resemble the definition of “results from”\nrecited above—we held that “[t]o establish a disparate­\ntreatment claim under the plain language of [§623(a)(1)]\n. . . a plaintiff must prove that age was [a] ‘but for’ cause of\nthe employer’s adverse decision.” Gross v.

S. 167, 176 (2009).4\n    Our insistence on but-for causality has not been re­\nstricted to statutes using the term “because of.” We have,\nfor instance, observed that “[i]n common talk, the phrase\n‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship,” Safeco\nIns.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n323, 245 S. E. 2d 754, 763 (1978) (statute requiring sup­\npression of evidence “ ‘obtained as a result of ’ ” police\nmisconduct “requires, at a minimum,” a but-for causal\nrelationship between the misconduct and collection of the\nevidence).\n   In sum, it is one of the traditional background principles\n“against which Congress legislate[s],” Nassar, 570 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6–7), that a phrase such as “results from”\nimposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern­\nment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated\nwith drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with\nthe usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often\ntake drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention\nand Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010\ninvolved more than one drug. See Brief for United States\n28–29. This consideration leads the Government to urge\nan interpretation of “results from” under which use of a\ndrug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for\ncause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause\ndeath, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such\nas mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of\ndeath.\n   In support of its argument, the Government can point to\nthe undoubted reality that courts have not always re­\nquired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil­\nity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in­\nstance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes\nindependently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\nNassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467\n(describing these cases as “unusual” and “numerically in\nthe minority”). To illustrate, if “A stabs B, inflicting a\nfatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde­\npendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]\nwound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two\nwounds,” A will generally be liable for homicide even\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough his conduct was not a but-for cause of B’s death\n(since B would have died from X’s actions in any event).\nId., at 468 (italics omitted). We need not accept or reject\nthe special rule developed for these cases, since there was\nno evidence here that Banka’s heroin use was an inde­\npendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was\nprepared to say that Banka would have died from the\nheroin use alone.\n   Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less\ndemanding (but also less well established) line of author­\nity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause­\nin-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in\nproducing a given result. Several state courts have adopted\nsuch a rule, see State v. Christman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

One promi­\nnent authority on tort law asserts that “a broader rule . . .\nhas found general acceptance: The defendant’s conduct is\na cause of the event if it was a material element and a\nsubstantial factor in bringing it about.” W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts §41, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But\nthe authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the\ntort context, “[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated” (an\napparent reference to the situation where each of two\ncauses is independently effective) “no case has been found\nwhere the defendant’s act could be called a substantial\nfactor when the event would have occurred without it.”\nId., at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative\nrule—functionally identical to the one the Government\n12              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues here—that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con­\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.” Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, “no judicial opin­\nion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.” Ibid., n. 40. The\n“death results” enhancement became law just two years\nlater.\n   We decline to adopt the Government’s permissive inter­\npretation of §841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted\nrequires death to “result from” use of the unlawfully dis­\ntributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which\ndrug use merely contributed. Congress could have written\n§841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the\nunderlying crime “contributes to” death or serious bodily\ninjury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to\ncases involving concurrent causes, as five States have\ndone, see Ala. Code §13A–2–5(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.\n§5–2–205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §33\n(2006); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. §12.1–02–05 (Lexis 2012);\nTex. Penal Code Ann. §6.04 (West 2011). It chose instead\nto use language that imports but-for causality. Especially\nin the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the\nrule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,\n107–108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is\ndifferent from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that\ndisfavors the defendant.\n                             B\n  The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of\n“results from” will “unduly limi[t] criminal responsibility”\nand “cannot be reconciled with sound policy.” Brief for\nUnited States 24. We doubt that the requirement of but­\nfor causation for this incremental punishment will prove a\npolicy disaster. A cursory search of the Federal Reporter\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuper­\nable barrier the Government makes it out to be. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Krieger, 628 F. 3d 857, 870–871 (CA7\n2010) (affirming “death results” conviction based on expert\ntestimony that, although the victim had several drugs in\nher system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a\nbut-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F. 3d\n1238, 1254–1255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same). More­\nover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for\ncausation, the defendant will still be liable for violating\n§841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence\nunder §841(b)(1).\n   Indeed, it is more likely the Government’s proposal that\n“cannot be reconciled with sound policy,” given the need\nfor clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial\nauthorities invoking a “substantial” or “contributing”\nfactor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica­\ntion of it. Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1893) (an act is an actual cause if it\n“contributed materially” to a result, even if other concur­\nrent acts would have produced that result on their own),\nwith Cox v.

Code Ann. §5–2–205 (1987)).5 Here the Gov­\nernment is uncertain about the precise application of the\ntest that it proposes. Taken literally, its “contributing­\ncause” test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or\nomission that makes a positive incremental contribution,\n——————\n  5 Some cases apply what they call a “substantial factor” test only\n\nwhen multiple independently sufficient causes “operat[e] together to\ncause the result.” Eversley v.

UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever small, to a particular result. See Brief for State\nof Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black’s Law\nDictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “contributing\ncause” as “[a] factor that—though not the primary cause—\nplays a part in producing a result”). But at oral argument\nthe Government insisted that its test excludes causes that\nare “not important enough” or “too insubstantial.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how\nimportant or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.\nSee id., at 41–42. Presumably the lower courts would be\nleft to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since\nthe evidence in §841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms\nof probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in\nthis case, for example, testified that Banka’s death would\nhave been “[v]ery less likely” had he not used the heroin\nthat Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use\nof a drug made the victim’s death 50 percent more likely?\nFifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that\nkind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable­\ndoubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the\nneed to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons\ncan comprehend. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery\nCo., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).\n   But in the last analysis, these always-fascinating policy\ndiscussions are beside the point.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 12–7515. Argued November 12, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014\nLong-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that in-\n  cluded using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage\n  pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,\n  that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that “death . . . result-\n  ed from the use of th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to a\n  20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhance-\n  ment provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.\n  §841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka\n  might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved\n  for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka’s death could only\n  “result from” heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-\n  for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant\n  here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that\n  heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Bur-\n  rage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the\n  Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court’s jury instruction.\nHeld: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not\n an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s death or serious bod-\n ily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement un-\n der §841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or in-\n jury. Pp. 4–15.\n     (a) Section 841(b)(1)(C)’s “death results” enhancement, which in-\n creased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\n exposed, is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found\n beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570\n U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.\n    (b) Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define “results\n from,” the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\n2                     BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. Ordinarily, that phrase\n    imposes a requirement of actual causality, i.e., proof “ ‘that the harm\n    would not have occurred’ in the absence of—that is, but for—the de-\n    fendant’s conduct.” University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center\n    v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___. Similar statutory phrases—“because\n    of,” see id., at ___, “ ‘based on,’ ” Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,\n    551 U. S. 47, 63, and “ ‘by reason of,’ ” Gross v. FBL Financial Ser-\n    vices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176—have been read to impose a but-for\n    causation requirement. This Court declines to adopt the Govern-\n    ment’s permissive interpretation of “results from” to mean that use of\n    a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggre-\n    gate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause\n    of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for\n    cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concur-\n    rently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka’s hero-\n    in use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And\n    though Congress could have written §841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or\n    omission a cause-in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” fac-\n    tor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that\n    imports but-for causality. Pp. 6–12.\n       (c) Whether adopting the but-for causation requirement or the\n    Government’s interpretation raises policy concerns is beside the\n    point, for the Court’s role is to apply the statute as written.

Banka immediately cooked and in­\njected some of the heroin and, after returning home, in­\njected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April\n15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after\nwitnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When\nNoragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead\nin the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple’s\nhome and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,\nalprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a\nbottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\n   Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment\nalleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of\n§841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at\nissue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of\nheroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2\nalleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on\nApril 14, 2010, and that “death . . . resulted from the use\nof th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to the 20­\nyear mandatory minimum of §841(b)(1)(C).\n   Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the\ncause of Banka’s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic\ntoxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present\nin Banka’s system at the time of his death, including\nheroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-\nolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a “product of\nmetabolism,” Webster’s New International Dictionary\n1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it,\n“what a drug breaks down into in the body,” 687 F. 3d\n1015, 1018, n. 2 (CA8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin\nmetabolite, was the only drug present at a level above\nthe therapeutic range—i.e., the concentration normally\npresent when a person takes a drug as prescribed—Dr.\nSchwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived\nhad he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless\nconcluded that heroin “was a contributing factor” in\nBanka’s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The heroin, in other words, contributed\nto an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.\nDr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner,\ncame to similar conclusions. She described the cause of\ndeath as “mixed drug intoxication” with heroin, oxycodone,\nalprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a “contributing”\nrole. Id., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether\nBanka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but\nobserved that Banka’s death would have been “[v]ery less\nlikely.” Id., at 171.\n   The District Court denied Burrage’s motion for a judg­\nment of acquittal, which argued that Banka’s death did\nnot “result from” heroin use because there was no evidence\nthat heroin was a but-for cause of death. Id., at 30. The\ncourt also declined to give Burrage’s proposed jury instruc­\ntions regarding causation. One of those instructions\nwould have required the Government to prove that heroin\nuse “was the proximate cause of [Banka’s] death.” Id., at\n236. Another would have defined proximate cause as\n“a cause of death that played a substantial part in bring­\ning about the death,” meaning that “[t]he death must\nhave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable\nconsequence of the cause and except for the cause the\ndeath would not have occurred.” Id., at 238. The court\ninstead gave an instruction requiring the Government to\nprove “that the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a\ncontributing cause of Joshua Banka’s death.” Id., at 241–\n242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the\ncourt sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment, consistent\nwith §841(b)(1)(C)’s prescribed minimum.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed\nBurrage’s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015. As to the causation­\nin-fact element of count 2, the court held that the\nDistrict Court’s contributing-cause instruction was con­\nsistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Mon-\n4                   BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnier, 412 F. 3d 859, 862 (CA8 2005). See 687 F. 3d, at\n1021. As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage’s\nproposed instructions “d[id] not correctly state the law”\nbecause “a showing of ‘proximate cause’ is not required.”\nId., at 1020 (quoting United States v. McIntosh, 236 F. 3d\n968, 972–973 (CA8 2001)).\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: Whether the\ndefendant may be convicted under the “death results” pro­\nvision (1) when the use of the controlled substance was a\n“contributing cause” of the death, and (2) without sepa­\nrately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the\nvictim’s death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of\nthe defendant’s drug-trafficking offense. 569 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                              II\n   As originally enacted, the Controlled Substances Act, 84\nStat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. §801 et seq., “tied the penalties for\ndrug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity\ninvolved, with no provision for mandatory minimum sen­\ntences.” DePierre v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 3–4). That changed in 1986 when\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 100 Stat.\n3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the\nmaximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many\noffenders, including the “death results” enhancement at\nissue here. See id., at 3207–4. With respect to violations\ninvolving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the\ntypes of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addic­\ntive1) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to\n——————\n  1 Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have “a high potential for abuse,”\n\n“no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates,” and “a lack of accepted safety” even “under medical supervision.”\n§812(b)(1). Schedule II drugs, such as methamphetamine, likewise\nhave “a high potential for abuse” and a propensity to cause “severe\npsychological or physical dependence” if misused. 21 U. S. C. §812(b)(2).\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

These default sentencing rules do not apply,\nhowever, when “death or serious bodily injury results from\nthe use of [the distributed] substance.” §841(b)(1)(A)–(C).\nIn those instances, the defendant “shall be sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than\ntwenty years or more than life,” a substantial fine, “or\nboth.”2 Ibid.\n   Because the “death results” enhancement increased the\nminimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\nexposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See Alleyne v.\nUnited States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14–15);\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Thus,\nthe crime charged in count 2 of Burrage’s superseding\nindictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or\nintentional distribution of heroin, §841(a)(1),3 and (ii)\ndeath caused by (“resulting from”) the use of that drug,\n§841(b)(1)(C).\n\n\n\n——————\n  2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may\n\nimpose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the “death\nresults” provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have\nconcluded, in effect, that the “or” is a scrivener’s error, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The\nbest evidence of that is the concluding sentence of §841(b)(1)(C), which\nstates that a court “shall not place on probation or suspend the sen­\ntence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara­\ngraph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or\nserious bodily injury results.” (Emphasis added.)\n  3 Violation of §841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime\n\ncharged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that\nlesser included offense.\n6               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n    The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,\nconsisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal\ncause. H. Hart & A. Honoré, Causation in the Law 104\n(1959). When a crime requires “not merely conduct but\nalso a specified result of conduct,” a defendant generally\nmay not be convicted unless his conduct is “both (1) the\nactual cause, and (2) the ‘legal’ cause (often called the\n‘proximate cause’) of the result.” 1 W. LaFave, Substan­\ntive Criminal Law §6.4(a), pp. 464–466 (2d ed. 2003) (here­\ninafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code §2.03,\np. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with\nthe two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find\nit necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of\nheroin was the actual cause of Banka’s death in the sense\nthat §841(b)(1)(C) requires.\n    The Controlled Substances Act does not define the\nphrase “results from,” so we give it its ordinary meaning.\nSee Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995). A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect,\nissue, or outcome from some action, process or design.”\n2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).\n“Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of\nactual causality. “In the usual course,” this requires proof\n“ ‘that the harm would not have occurred’ in the absence\nof—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Restatement of\nTorts §431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code\nreflects this traditional understanding; it states that\n“[c]onduct is the cause of a result” if “it is an antecedent\nbut for which the result in question would not have oc­\ncurred.” §2.03(1)(a). That formulation represents “the\nminimum requirement for a finding of causation when a\ncrime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nresult.” Id., Explanatory Note (emphasis added); see also\nUnited States v. Hatfield, 591 F. 3d 945, 948 (CA7 2010)\n(but for “is the minimum concept of cause”); Callahan v.\nCardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862 (Mo.\n1993) (same).\n   Thus, “where A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say\nthat A [actually] caused B’s death, since but for A’s con­\nduct B would not have died.” LaFave 467–468 (italics\nomitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act\ncombines with other factors to produce the result, so long\nas the other factors alone would not have done so—if, so to\nspeak, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Thus,\nif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those\ndiseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without\nthe incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\nSee, e.g., State v. Frazier, 339 Mo. 966, 974–975, 98 S. W.\n2d 707, 712–713 (1936).\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common under­\nstanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the\nvisiting team’s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of\nthe first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a\nscore of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English\nlanguage and familiar with the American pastime would\nagree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is\nso because it is natural to say that one event is the out­\ncome or consequence of another when the former would\nnot have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point\nthat the victory also resulted from a host of other neces­\nsary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach’s decision\nto put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league’s\ndecision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little\nsense to say that an event resulted from or was the out­\ncome of some earlier action if the action merely played a\nnonessential contributing role in producing the event. If\nthe visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than\n8                BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page\nthat the victory resulted from the leadoff batter’s early,\nnon-dispositive home run.\n  Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the\ncontrary, courts regularly read phrases like “results from”\nto require but-for causality. Our interpretation of statutes\nthat prohibit adverse employment action “because of ” an\nemployee’s age or complaints about unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed\nTitle VII’s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:\n    “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer . . . to discriminate against any individual\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an un­\n    lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or be-\n    cause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42\n    U. S. C. §2000e–3(a) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\nGiven the ordinary meaning of the word “because,” we\nheld that §2000e–3(a) “require[s] proof that the desire to\nretaliate was [a] but-for cause of the challenged employ­\nment action.” Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).\nThe same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a\nprovision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\nthat makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to discharge\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi­\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi­\nvidual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a)(1) (emphasis added).\nRelying on dictionary definitions of “[t]he words ‘because\nof ’ ”—which resemble the definition of “results from”\nrecited above—we held that “[t]o establish a disparate­\ntreatment claim under the plain language of [§623(a)(1)]\n. . . a plaintiff must prove that age was [a] ‘but for’ cause of\nthe employer’s adverse decision.” Gross v.

S. 167, 176 (2009).4\n    Our insistence on but-for causality has not been re­\nstricted to statutes using the term “because of.” We have,\nfor instance, observed that “[i]n common talk, the phrase\n‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship,” Safeco\nIns. Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63 (2007), and\nthat “the phrase, ‘by reason of,’ requires at least a showing\nof ‘but for’ causation,” Gross, supra, at 176 (citing Bridge\nv. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 653–654\n(2008)). See also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation, 503 U. S. 258, 265–268 (1992) (explaining\nthat a statute permitting recovery for injuries suffered\n“ ‘by reason of ’ ” the defendant’s unlawful conduct “re­\nquire[s] a showing that the defendant’s violation . . . was,”\namong other things, “a ‘but for’ cause of his injury”). State\ncourts, which hear and decide the bulk of the Nation’s\ncriminal matters, usually interpret similarly worded crim-\ninal statutes in the same manner. See, e.g., People v.\nWood, 276 Mich. App. 669, 671, 741 N. W. 2d 574, 575–578\n(2007) (construing the phrase “[i]f the violation results in\nthe death of another individual” to require proof of but-for\ncausation (emphasis deleted)); State v.

The three opinions of six Justices in that case did not eliminate\nthe but-for-cause requirement imposed by the “because of ” provision of\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a), but allowed a showing that discrimination was\na “motivating” or “substantial” factor to shift the burden of persuasion\nto the employer to establish the absence of but-for cause. See Univer-\nsity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 7–10). Congress later amended the statute to\ndispense with but-for causality.

UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n323, 245 S. E. 2d 754, 763 (1978) (statute requiring sup­\npression of evidence “ ‘obtained as a result of ’ ” police\nmisconduct “requires, at a minimum,” a but-for causal\nrelationship between the misconduct and collection of the\nevidence).\n   In sum, it is one of the traditional background principles\n“against which Congress legislate[s],” Nassar, 570 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6–7), that a phrase such as “results from”\nimposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern­\nment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated\nwith drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with\nthe usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often\ntake drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention\nand Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010\ninvolved more than one drug. See Brief for United States\n28–29. This consideration leads the Government to urge\nan interpretation of “results from” under which use of a\ndrug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for\ncause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause\ndeath, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such\nas mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of\ndeath.\n   In support of its argument, the Government can point to\nthe undoubted reality that courts have not always re­\nquired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil­\nity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in­\nstance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes\nindependently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\nNassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467\n(describing these cases as “unusual” and “numerically in\nthe minority”). To illustrate, if “A stabs B, inflicting a\nfatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde­\npendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]\nwound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two\nwounds,” A will generally be liable for homicide even\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

We need not accept or reject\nthe special rule developed for these cases, since there was\nno evidence here that Banka’s heroin use was an inde­\npendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was\nprepared to say that Banka would have died from the\nheroin use alone.\n   Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less\ndemanding (but also less well established) line of author­\nity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause­\nin-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in\nproducing a given result. Several state courts have adopted\nsuch a rule, see State v. Christman, 160 Wash. App.\n741, 745, 249 P. 3d 680, 687 (2011); People v. Jennings, 50\nCal. 4th 616, 643, 237 P. 3d 474, 496 (2010); People v.\nBailey, 451 Mich. 657, 676–678, 549 N. W. 2d 325, 334–\n336 (1996); Commonwealth v. Osachuk, 43 Mass. App. 71,\n72–73, 681 N. E. 2d 292, 294 (1997), but the American\nLaw Institute declined to do so in its Model Penal Code,\nsee ALI, 39th Annual Meeting Proceedings 135–141\n(1962); see also Model Penal Code §2.03(1)(a). One promi­\nnent authority on tort law asserts that “a broader rule . . .\nhas found general acceptance: The defendant’s conduct is\na cause of the event if it was a material element and a\nsubstantial factor in bringing it about.” W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts §41, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But\nthe authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the\ntort context, “[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated” (an\napparent reference to the situation where each of two\ncauses is independently effective) “no case has been found\nwhere the defendant’s act could be called a substantial\nfactor when the event would have occurred without it.”\nId., at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative\nrule—functionally identical to the one the Government\n12              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues here—that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con­\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.” Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, “no judicial opin­\nion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.” Ibid., n. 40. The\n“death results” enhancement became law just two years\nlater.\n   We decline to adopt the Government’s permissive inter­\npretation of §841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted\nrequires death to “result from” use of the unlawfully dis­\ntributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which\ndrug use merely contributed. Congress could have written\n§841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the\nunderlying crime “contributes to” death or serious bodily\ninjury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to\ncases involving concurrent causes, as five States have\ndone, see Ala. Code §13A–2–5(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.\n§5–2–205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §33\n(2006); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. §12.1–02–05 (Lexis 2012);\nTex. Penal Code Ann. §6.04 (West 2011). It chose instead\nto use language that imports but-for causality. Especially\nin the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the\nrule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,\n107–108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is\ndifferent from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that\ndisfavors the defendant.\n                             B\n  The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of\n“results from” will “unduly limi[t] criminal responsibility”\nand “cannot be reconciled with sound policy.” Brief for\nUnited States 24.

More­\nover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for\ncausation, the defendant will still be liable for violating\n§841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence\nunder §841(b)(1).\n   Indeed, it is more likely the Government’s proposal that\n“cannot be reconciled with sound policy,” given the need\nfor clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial\nauthorities invoking a “substantial” or “contributing”\nfactor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica­\ntion of it. Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1893) (an act is an actual cause if it\n“contributed materially” to a result, even if other concur­\nrent acts would have produced that result on their own),\nwith Cox v. State, 305 Ark. 244, 248, 808 S. W. 2d 306, 309\n(1991) (causation cannot be found where other concurrent\ncauses were clearly sufficient to produce the result and the\ndefendant’s act was clearly insufficient to produce it (ap­\nplying Ark. Code Ann. §5–2–205 (1987)).5 Here the Gov­\nernment is uncertain about the precise application of the\ntest that it proposes. Taken literally, its “contributing­\ncause” test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or\nomission that makes a positive incremental contribution,\n——————\n  5 Some cases apply what they call a “substantial factor” test only\n\nwhen multiple independently sufficient causes “operat[e] together to\ncause the result.” Eversley v. Florida, 748 So. 2d 963, 967 (Fla. 1999);\nsee also Callahan v. Cardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862–\n863 (Mo. 1993). We will not exaggerate the confusion by counting these\nas genuine “substantial factor” cases.\n14              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever small, to a particular result. See Brief for State\nof Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black’s Law\nDictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “contributing\ncause” as “[a] factor that—though not the primary cause—\nplays a part in producing a result”). But at oral argument\nthe Government insisted that its test excludes causes that\nare “not important enough” or “too insubstantial.” Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how\nimportant or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.\nSee id., at 41–42. Presumably the lower courts would be\nleft to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since\nthe evidence in §841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms\nof probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in\nthis case, for example, testified that Banka’s death would\nhave been “[v]ery less likely” had he not used the heroin\nthat Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use\nof a drug made the victim’s death 50 percent more likely?\nFifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that\nkind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable­\ndoubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the\nneed to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons\ncan comprehend. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery\nCo., 255 U. S. 81, 89–90 (1921).\n   But in the last analysis, these always-fascinating policy\ndiscussions are beside the point. The role of this Court is\nto apply the statute as it is written—even if we think some\nother approach might “ ‘accor[d] with good policy.’ ” Com-\nmissioner v. Lundy, 516 U. S. 235, 252 (1996) (quoting\nBadaracco v. Commissioner, 464 U. S. 386, 398 (1984)).\nAs we have discussed, it is written to require but-for\ncause.\n                        *     *    *\n  We hold that, at least where use of the drug distributed\nby the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause\nof the victim’s death or serious bodily injury, a defendant\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncannot be liable under the penalty enhancement provision\nof 21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for\ncause of the death or injury. The Eighth Circuit affirmed\nBurrage’s conviction based on a markedly different under­\nstanding of the statute, see 687 F. 3d, at 1020–1024, and\nthe Government concedes that there is no “evidence that\nBanka would have lived but for his heroin use,” Brief for\nUnited States 33. Burrage’s conviction with respect to\ncount 2 of the superseding indictment is therefore re­\nversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n                                            It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570\nU. S. ___, ___ (2013), I do not read “because of ” in the\ncontext of antidiscrimination laws to mean “solely because\nof.” See id., at ___–___, ___–___ (slip op., at 20–21, 23–24).\nAnd I do not agree that words “appear[ing] in two or more\nlegal rules, and so in connection with more than one pur-\npose, ha[ve] and should have precisely the same scope in\nall of them.” Cook, “Substance” and “Procedure” in the\nConflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933). But I do\nagree that “in the interpretation of a criminal statute\nsubject to the rule of lenity,” where there is room for de-\nbate, one should not choose the construction “that disfa-\nvors the defendant.” Ante, at 12. Accordingly, I join the\nCourt’s judgment.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2651115/", "sha1": "2527249f96a454e2c0e4cb547ce931e2668a71e6", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-015", "time_retrieved": "2014-01-27T11:07:40.460715"}
