UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 12\u20137515. Argued November 12, 2013\u2014Decided January 27, 2014\nLong-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that in-\n  cluded using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage\n  pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,\n  that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that \u201cdeath . . . result-\n  ed from the use of th[at] substance\u201d\u2014thus subjecting Burrage to a\n  20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhance-\n  ment provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka\n  might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved\n  for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka\u2019s death could only\n  \u201cresult from\u201d heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-\n  for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant\n  here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that\n  heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Bur-\n  rage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the\n  Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court\u2019s jury instruction.\nHeld: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not\n an independently sufficient cause of the victim\u2019s death or serious bod-\n ily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement un-\n der \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or in-\n jury. Pp. 4\u201315.\n     (a) Section 841(b)(1)(C)\u2019s \u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement, which in-\n creased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\n exposed, is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found\n beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570\n U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4\u20135.\n    (b) Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define \u201cresults\n from,\u201d the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\n2                     BURRAGE v.

Ordinarily, that phrase\n    imposes a requirement of actual causality, i.e., proof \u201c \u2018that the harm\n    would not have occurred\u2019 in the absence of\u2014that is, but for\u2014the de-\n    fendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d University of Tex.

S. 167, 176\u2014have been read to impose a but-for\n    causation requirement. This Court declines to adopt the Govern-\n    ment\u2019s permissive interpretation of \u201cresults from\u201d to mean that use of\n    a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggre-\n    gate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause\n    of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for\n    cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concur-\n    rently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka\u2019s hero-\n    in use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And\n    though Congress could have written \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or\n    omission a cause-in-fact if it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d fac-\n    tor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that\n    imports but-for causality. Pp. 6\u201312.\n       (c) Whether adopting the but-for causation requirement or the\n    Government\u2019s interpretation raises policy concerns is beside the\n    point, for the Court\u2019s role is to apply the statute as written.

S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)\u2013(C) (2012 ed.). We consider\nwhether the mandatory-minimum provision applies when\nuse of a covered drug supplied by the defendant contrib\u00ad\nutes to, but is not a but-for cause of, the victim\u2019s death or\ninjury.\n                             I\n  Joshua Banka, a long-time drug user, died on April 15,\n2010, following an extended drug binge. The episode\nbegan on the morning of April 14, when Banka smoked\nmarijuana at a former roommate\u2019s home. Banka stole\noxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and\nlater crushed, cooked, and injected the oxycodone. Banka\nand his wife, Tammy Noragon Banka (Noragon), then met\nwith petitioner Marcus Burrage and purchased one gram\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *JUSTICE ALITO joins all but Part III\u2013B of this opinion.\n2               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof heroin from him. Banka immediately cooked and in\u00ad\njected some of the heroin and, after returning home, in\u00ad\njected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April\n15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after\nwitnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When\nNoragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead\nin the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple\u2019s\nhome and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,\nalprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a\nbottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\n   Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment\nalleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of\n\u00a7841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at\nissue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of\nheroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2\nalleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on\nApril 14, 2010, and that \u201cdeath . . . resulted from the use\nof th[at] substance\u201d\u2014thus subjecting Burrage to the 20\u00ad\nyear mandatory minimum of \u00a7841(b)(1)(C).\n   Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the\ncause of Banka\u2019s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic\ntoxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present\nin Banka\u2019s system at the time of his death, including\nheroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-\nolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a \u201cproduct of\nmetabolism,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it,\n\u201cwhat a drug breaks down into in the body,\u201d 687 F. 3d\n1015, 1018, n. 2 (CA8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin\nmetabolite, was the only drug present at a level above\nthe therapeutic range\u2014i.e., the concentration normally\npresent when a person takes a drug as prescribed\u2014Dr.\nSchwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived\nhad he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless\nconcluded that heroin \u201cwas a contributing factor\u201d in\nBanka\u2019s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncause \u201crespiratory and/or central nervous system depres\u00ad\nsion.\u201d App. 196. The heroin, in other words, contributed\nto an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.\nDr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner,\ncame to similar conclusions. She described the cause of\ndeath as \u201cmixed drug intoxication\u201d with heroin, oxycodone,\nalprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a \u201ccontributing\u201d\nrole. Id., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether\nBanka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but\nobserved that Banka\u2019s death would have been \u201c[v]ery less\nlikely.\u201d Id., at 171.\n   The District Court denied Burrage\u2019s motion for a judg\u00ad\nment of acquittal, which argued that Banka\u2019s death did\nnot \u201cresult from\u201d heroin use because there was no evidence\nthat heroin was a but-for cause of death. Id., at 30. The\ncourt also declined to give Burrage\u2019s proposed jury instruc\u00ad\ntions regarding causation. One of those instructions\nwould have required the Government to prove that heroin\nuse \u201cwas the proximate cause of [Banka\u2019s] death.\u201d Id., at\n236. Another would have defined proximate cause as\n\u201ca cause of death that played a substantial part in bring\u00ad\ning about the death,\u201d meaning that \u201c[t]he death must\nhave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable\nconsequence of the cause and except for the cause the\ndeath would not have occurred.\u201d Id., at 238. The court\ninstead gave an instruction requiring the Government to\nprove \u201cthat the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a\ncontributing cause of Joshua Banka\u2019s death.\u201d Id., at 241\u2013\n242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the\ncourt sentenced him to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, consistent\nwith \u00a7841(b)(1)(C)\u2019s prescribed minimum.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed\nBurrage\u2019s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015. As to the causation\u00ad\nin-fact element of count 2, the court held that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s contributing-cause instruction was con\u00ad\nsistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Mon-\n4                   BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnier, 412 F. 3d 859, 862 (CA8 2005). See 687 F. 3d, at\n1021. As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage\u2019s\nproposed instructions \u201cd[id] not correctly state the law\u201d\nbecause \u201ca showing of \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is not required.\u201d\nId., at 1020 (quoting United States v. McIntosh, 236 F. 3d\n968, 972\u2013973 (CA8 2001)).\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: Whether the\ndefendant may be convicted under the \u201cdeath results\u201d pro\u00ad\nvision (1) when the use of the controlled substance was a\n\u201ccontributing cause\u201d of the death, and (2) without sepa\u00ad\nrately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the\nvictim\u2019s death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of\nthe defendant\u2019s drug-trafficking offense. 569 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                              II\n   As originally enacted, the Controlled Substances Act, 84\nStat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et seq., \u201ctied the penalties for\ndrug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity\ninvolved, with no provision for mandatory minimum sen\u00ad\ntences.\u201d DePierre v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 3\u20134). That changed in 1986 when\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 100 Stat.\n3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the\nmaximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many\noffenders, including the \u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement at\nissue here. See id., at 3207\u20134. With respect to violations\ninvolving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the\ntypes of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addic\u00ad\ntive1) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have \u201ca high potential for abuse,\u201d\n\n\u201cno currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates,\u201d and \u201ca lack of accepted safety\u201d even \u201cunder medical supervision.\u201d\n\u00a7812(b)(1). Schedule II drugs, such as methamphetamine, likewise\nhave \u201ca high potential for abuse\u201d and a propensity to cause \u201csevere\npsychological or physical dependence\u201d if misused. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7812(b)(2).\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlife imprisonment for large-scale distributions, \u00a7841(b)\n(1)(A), from 5 to 40 years for medium-scale distribu\u00ad\ntions, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B), and not more than 20 years for\nsmaller distributions, \u00a7841(b)(1)(C), the type of offense at\nissue here. These default sentencing rules do not apply,\nhowever, when \u201cdeath or serious bodily injury results from\nthe use of [the distributed] substance.\u201d \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C).\nIn those instances, the defendant \u201cshall be sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than\ntwenty years or more than life,\u201d a substantial fine, \u201cor\nboth.\u201d2 Ibid.\n   Because the \u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement increased the\nminimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\nexposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See Alleyne v.\nUnited States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14\u201315);\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Thus,\nthe crime charged in count 2 of Burrage\u2019s superseding\nindictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or\nintentional distribution of heroin, \u00a7841(a)(1),3 and (ii)\ndeath caused by (\u201cresulting from\u201d) the use of that drug,\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(C).\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may\n\nimpose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the \u201cdeath\nresults\u201d provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have\nconcluded, in effect, that the \u201cor\u201d is a scrivener\u2019s error, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The\nbest evidence of that is the concluding sentence of \u00a7841(b)(1)(C), which\nstates that a court \u201cshall not place on probation or suspend the sen\u00ad\ntence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara\u00ad\ngraph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or\nserious bodily injury results.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n  3 Violation of \u00a7841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime\n\ncharged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that\nlesser included offense.\n6               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n    The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,\nconsisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal\ncause. H. Hart & A. Honor\u00e9, Causation in the Law 104\n(1959). When a crime requires \u201cnot merely conduct but\nalso a specified result of conduct,\u201d a defendant generally\nmay not be convicted unless his conduct is \u201cboth (1) the\nactual cause, and (2) the \u2018legal\u2019 cause (often called the\n\u2018proximate cause\u2019) of the result.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, Substan\u00ad\ntive Criminal Law \u00a76.4(a), pp. 464\u2013466 (2d ed. 2003) (here\u00ad\ninafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a72.03,\np. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with\nthe two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find\nit necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of\nheroin was the actual cause of Banka\u2019s death in the sense\nthat \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) requires.\n    The Controlled Substances Act does not define the\nphrase \u201cresults from,\u201d so we give it its ordinary meaning.\nSee Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995). A thing \u201cresults\u201d when it \u201c[a]rise[s] as an effect,\nissue, or outcome from some action, process or design.\u201d\n2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).\n\u201cResults from\u201d imposes, in other words, a requirement of\nactual causality. \u201cIn the usual course,\u201d this requires proof\n\u201c \u2018that the harm would not have occurred\u2019 in the absence\nof\u2014that is, but for\u2014the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5\u20136) (quoting Restatement of\nTorts \u00a7431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code\nreflects this traditional understanding; it states that\n\u201c[c]onduct is the cause of a result\u201d if \u201cit is an antecedent\nbut for which the result in question would not have oc\u00ad\ncurred.\u201d \u00a72.03(1)(a).

The same conclusion follows if the predicate act\ncombines with other factors to produce the result, so long\nas the other factors alone would not have done so\u2014if, so to\nspeak, it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Thus,\nif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those\ndiseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without\nthe incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\nSee, e.g., State v. Frazier, 339 Mo. 966, 974\u2013975, 98 S. W.\n2d 707, 712\u2013713 (1936).\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common under\u00ad\nstanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the\nvisiting team\u2019s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of\nthe first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a\nscore of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English\nlanguage and familiar with the American pastime would\nagree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is\nso because it is natural to say that one event is the out\u00ad\ncome or consequence of another when the former would\nnot have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point\nthat the victory also resulted from a host of other neces\u00ad\nsary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach\u2019s decision\nto put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league\u2019s\ndecision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little\nsense to say that an event resulted from or was the out\u00ad\ncome of some earlier action if the action merely played a\nnonessential contributing role in producing the event.

Our interpretation of statutes\nthat prohibit adverse employment action \u201cbecause of \u201d an\nemployee\u2019s age or complaints about unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed\nTitle VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:\n    \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer . . . to discriminate against any individual\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an un\u00ad\n    lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or be-\n    cause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42\n    U.

See Univer-\nsity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 7\u201310). Congress later amended the statute to\ndispense with but-for causality.

E. 2d 754, 763 (1978) (statute requiring sup\u00ad\npression of evidence \u201c \u2018obtained as a result of \u2019 \u201d police\nmisconduct \u201crequires, at a minimum,\u201d a but-for causal\nrelationship between the misconduct and collection of the\nevidence).\n   In sum, it is one of the traditional background principles\n\u201cagainst which Congress legislate[s],\u201d Nassar, 570 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137), that a phrase such as \u201cresults from\u201d\nimposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern\u00ad\nment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated\nwith drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with\nthe usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often\ntake drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention\nand Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010\ninvolved more than one drug. See Brief for United States\n28\u201329. This consideration leads the Government to urge\nan interpretation of \u201cresults from\u201d under which use of a\ndrug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for\ncause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause\ndeath, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such\nas mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of\ndeath.\n   In support of its argument, the Government can point to\nthe undoubted reality that courts have not always re\u00ad\nquired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil\u00ad\nity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in\u00ad\nstance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes\nindependently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\nNassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467\n(describing these cases as \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cnumerically in\nthe minority\u201d). To illustrate, if \u201cA stabs B, inflicting a\nfatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde\u00ad\npendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]\nwound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two\nwounds,\u201d A will generally be liable for homicide even\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthough his conduct was not a but-for cause of B\u2019s death\n(since B would have died from X\u2019s actions in any event).\nId., at 468 (italics omitted). We need not accept or reject\nthe special rule developed for these cases, since there was\nno evidence here that Banka\u2019s heroin use was an inde\u00ad\npendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was\nprepared to say that Banka would have died from the\nheroin use alone.\n   Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less\ndemanding (but also less well established) line of author\u00ad\nity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause\u00ad\nin-fact if it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d factor in\nproducing a given result. Several state courts have adopted\nsuch a rule, see State v. Christman, 160 Wash. App.\n741, 745, 249 P. 3d 680, 687 (2011); People v. Jennings, 50\nCal. 4th 616, 643, 237 P. 3d 474, 496 (2010); People v.\nBailey, 451 Mich. 657, 676\u2013678, 549 N. W. 2d 325, 334\u2013\n336 (1996); Commonwealth v. Osachuk, 43 Mass. App. 71,\n72\u201373, 681 N. E. 2d 292, 294 (1997), but the American\nLaw Institute declined to do so in its Model Penal Code,\nsee ALI, 39th Annual Meeting Proceedings 135\u2013141\n(1962); see also Model Penal Code \u00a72.03(1)(a). One promi\u00ad\nnent authority on tort law asserts that \u201ca broader rule . . .\nhas found general acceptance: The defendant\u2019s conduct is\na cause of the event if it was a material element and a\nsubstantial factor in bringing it about.\u201d W. Keeton, D.\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\nof Torts \u00a741, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But\nthe authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the\ntort context, \u201c[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated\u201d (an\napparent reference to the situation where each of two\ncauses is independently effective) \u201cno case has been found\nwhere the defendant\u2019s act could be called a substantial\nfactor when the event would have occurred without it.\u201d\nId., at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative\nrule\u2014functionally identical to the one the Government\n12              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues here\u2014that \u201c[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con\u00ad\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.\u201d Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, \u201cno judicial opin\u00ad\nion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.\u201d Ibid., n. 40. The\n\u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement became law just two years\nlater.\n   We decline to adopt the Government\u2019s permissive inter\u00ad\npretation of \u00a7841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted\nrequires death to \u201cresult from\u201d use of the unlawfully dis\u00ad\ntributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which\ndrug use merely contributed. Congress could have written\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the\nunderlying crime \u201ccontributes to\u201d death or serious bodily\ninjury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to\ncases involving concurrent causes, as five States have\ndone, see Ala. Code \u00a713A\u20132\u20135(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.\n\u00a75\u20132\u2013205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\u2013A, \u00a733\n(2006); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. \u00a712.1\u201302\u201305 (Lexis 2012);\nTex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a76.04 (West 2011). It chose instead\nto use language that imports but-for causality. Especially\nin the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the\nrule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,\n107\u2013108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is\ndifferent from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that\ndisfavors the defendant.\n                             B\n  The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cresults from\u201d will \u201cunduly limi[t] criminal responsibility\u201d\nand \u201ccannot be reconciled with sound policy.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 24. We doubt that the requirement of but\u00ad\nfor causation for this incremental punishment will prove a\npolicy disaster. A cursory search of the Federal Reporter\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuper\u00ad\nable barrier the Government makes it out to be. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Krieger, 628 F. 3d 857, 870\u2013871 (CA7\n2010) (affirming \u201cdeath results\u201d conviction based on expert\ntestimony that, although the victim had several drugs in\nher system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a\nbut-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F. 3d\n1238, 1254\u20131255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same). More\u00ad\nover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for\ncausation, the defendant will still be liable for violating\n\u00a7841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence\nunder \u00a7841(b)(1).\n   Indeed, it is more likely the Government\u2019s proposal that\n\u201ccannot be reconciled with sound policy,\u201d given the need\nfor clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial\nauthorities invoking a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d\nfactor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica\u00ad\ntion of it. Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1893) (an act is an actual cause if it\n\u201ccontributed materially\u201d to a result, even if other concur\u00ad\nrent acts would have produced that result on their own),\nwith Cox v. State, 305 Ark. 244, 248, 808 S. W. 2d 306, 309\n(1991) (causation cannot be found where other concurrent\ncauses were clearly sufficient to produce the result and the\ndefendant\u2019s act was clearly insufficient to produce it (ap\u00ad\nplying Ark. Code Ann. \u00a75\u20132\u2013205 (1987)).5 Here the Gov\u00ad\nernment is uncertain about the precise application of the\ntest that it proposes. Taken literally, its \u201ccontributing\u00ad\ncause\u201d test would treat as a cause-in-fact every act or\nomission that makes a positive incremental contribution,\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 Some cases apply what they call a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test only\n\nwhen multiple independently sufficient causes \u201coperat[e] together to\ncause the result.\u201d Eversley v. Florida, 748 So. 2d 963, 967 (Fla. 1999);\nsee also Callahan v. Cardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862\u2013\n863 (Mo. 1993). We will not exaggerate the confusion by counting these\nas genuine \u201csubstantial factor\u201d cases.\n14              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever small, to a particular result. See Brief for State\nof Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201ccontributing\ncause\u201d as \u201c[a] factor that\u2014though not the primary cause\u2014\nplays a part in producing a result\u201d). But at oral argument\nthe Government insisted that its test excludes causes that\nare \u201cnot important enough\u201d or \u201ctoo insubstantial.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how\nimportant or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.\nSee id., at 41\u201342. Presumably the lower courts would be\nleft to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since\nthe evidence in \u00a7841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms\nof probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in\nthis case, for example, testified that Banka\u2019s death would\nhave been \u201c[v]ery less likely\u201d had he not used the heroin\nthat Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use\nof a drug made the victim\u2019s death 50 percent more likely?\nFifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that\nkind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable\u00ad\ndoubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the\nneed to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons\ncan comprehend. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery\nCo., 255 U. S. 81, 89\u201390 (1921).\n   But in the last analysis, these always-fascinating policy\ndiscussions are beside the point.

UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\nNo. 12\u20137515. Argued November 12, 2013\u2014Decided January 27, 2014\nLong-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that in-\n  cluded using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage\n  pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,\n  that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that \u201cdeath . . . result-\n  ed from the use of th[at] substance\u201d\u2014thus subjecting Burrage to a\n  20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhance-\n  ment provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.\n  \u00a7841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka\n  might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved\n  for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka\u2019s death could only\n  \u201cresult from\u201d heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-\n  for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant\n  here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that\n  heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Bur-\n  rage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the\n  Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court\u2019s jury instruction.\nHeld: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not\n an independently sufficient cause of the victim\u2019s death or serious bod-\n ily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement un-\n der \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or in-\n jury.

See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570\n U. S. ___, ___.

This Court declines to adopt the Govern-\n    ment\u2019s permissive interpretation of \u201cresults from\u201d to mean that use of\n    a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggre-\n    gate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause\n    of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for\n    cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concur-\n    rently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka\u2019s hero-\n    in use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And\n    though Congress could have written \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or\n    omission a cause-in-fact if it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d fac-\n    tor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that\n    imports but-for causality.

S. C. \u00a7841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)\u2013(C) (2012 ed.). We consider\nwhether the mandatory-minimum provision applies when\nuse of a covered drug supplied by the defendant contrib\u00ad\nutes to, but is not a but-for cause of, the victim\u2019s death or\ninjury.\n                             I\n  Joshua Banka, a long-time drug user, died on April 15,\n2010, following an extended drug binge. The episode\nbegan on the morning of April 14, when Banka smoked\nmarijuana at a former roommate\u2019s home. Banka stole\noxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and\nlater crushed, cooked, and injected the oxycodone. Banka\nand his wife, Tammy Noragon Banka (Noragon), then met\nwith petitioner Marcus Burrage and purchased one gram\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n *JUSTICE ALITO joins all but Part III\u2013B of this opinion.\n2               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nof heroin from him. Banka immediately cooked and in\u00ad\njected some of the heroin and, after returning home, in\u00ad\njected more heroin between midnight and 1 a.m. on April\n15. Noragon went to sleep at around 5 a.m., shortly after\nwitnessing Banka prepare another batch of heroin. When\nNoragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead\nin the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple\u2019s\nhome and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,\nalprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a\nbottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\n   Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment\nalleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of\n\u00a7841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at\nissue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of\nheroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2\nalleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on\nApril 14, 2010, and that \u201cdeath . . . resulted from the use\nof th[at] substance\u201d\u2014thus subjecting Burrage to the 20\u00ad\nyear mandatory minimum of \u00a7841(b)(1)(C).\n   Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the\ncause of Banka\u2019s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic\ntoxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present\nin Banka\u2019s system at the time of his death, including\nheroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-\nolites, and oxycodone. (A metabolite is a \u201cproduct of\nmetabolism,\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary\n1544 (2d ed. 1950), or, as the Court of Appeals put it,\n\u201cwhat a drug breaks down into in the body,\u201d 687 F. 3d\n1015, 1018, n. 2 (CA8 2012).) Although morphine, a heroin\nmetabolite, was the only drug present at a level above\nthe therapeutic range\u2014i.e., the concentration normally\npresent when a person takes a drug as prescribed\u2014Dr.\nSchwilke could not say whether Banka would have lived\nhad he not taken the heroin. Dr. Schwilke nonetheless\nconcluded that heroin \u201cwas a contributing factor\u201d in\nBanka\u2019s death, since it interacted with the other drugs to\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncause \u201crespiratory and/or central nervous system depres\u00ad\nsion.\u201d App. 196. The heroin, in other words, contributed\nto an overall effect that caused Banka to stop breathing.\nDr. Jerri McLemore, an Iowa state medical examiner,\ncame to similar conclusions. She described the cause of\ndeath as \u201cmixed drug intoxication\u201d with heroin, oxycodone,\nalprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a \u201ccontributing\u201d\nrole. Id., at 157. Dr. McLemore could not say whether\nBanka would have lived had he not taken the heroin, but\nobserved that Banka\u2019s death would have been \u201c[v]ery less\nlikely.\u201d Id., at 171.\n   The District Court denied Burrage\u2019s motion for a judg\u00ad\nment of acquittal, which argued that Banka\u2019s death did\nnot \u201cresult from\u201d heroin use because there was no evidence\nthat heroin was a but-for cause of death. Id., at 30. The\ncourt also declined to give Burrage\u2019s proposed jury instruc\u00ad\ntions regarding causation. One of those instructions\nwould have required the Government to prove that heroin\nuse \u201cwas the proximate cause of [Banka\u2019s] death.\u201d Id., at\n236. Another would have defined proximate cause as\n\u201ca cause of death that played a substantial part in bring\u00ad\ning about the death,\u201d meaning that \u201c[t]he death must\nhave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable\nconsequence of the cause and except for the cause the\ndeath would not have occurred.\u201d Id., at 238. The court\ninstead gave an instruction requiring the Government to\nprove \u201cthat the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a\ncontributing cause of Joshua Banka\u2019s death.\u201d Id., at 241\u2013\n242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the\ncourt sentenced him to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, consistent\nwith \u00a7841(b)(1)(C)\u2019s prescribed minimum.\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed\nBurrage\u2019s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015. As to the causation\u00ad\nin-fact element of count 2, the court held that the\nDistrict Court\u2019s contributing-cause instruction was con\u00ad\nsistent with its earlier decision in United States v. Mon-\n4                   BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nnier, 412 F. 3d 859, 862 (CA8 2005). See 687 F. 3d, at\n1021. As to proximate cause, the court held that Burrage\u2019s\nproposed instructions \u201cd[id] not correctly state the law\u201d\nbecause \u201ca showing of \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is not required.\u201d\nId., at 1020 (quoting United States v. McIntosh, 236 F. 3d\n968, 972\u2013973 (CA8 2001)).\n  We granted certiorari on two questions: Whether the\ndefendant may be convicted under the \u201cdeath results\u201d pro\u00ad\nvision (1) when the use of the controlled substance was a\n\u201ccontributing cause\u201d of the death, and (2) without sepa\u00ad\nrately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the\nvictim\u2019s death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of\nthe defendant\u2019s drug-trafficking offense. 569 U. S. ___\n(2013).\n                              II\n   As originally enacted, the Controlled Substances Act, 84\nStat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7801 et seq., \u201ctied the penalties for\ndrug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity\ninvolved, with no provision for mandatory minimum sen\u00ad\ntences.\u201d DePierre v. United States, 564 U. S. ___, ___\n(2011) (slip op., at 3\u20134). That changed in 1986 when\nCongress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 100 Stat.\n3207, which redefined the offense categories, increased the\nmaximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many\noffenders, including the \u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement at\nissue here. See id., at 3207\u20134. With respect to violations\ninvolving distribution of a Schedule I or II substance (the\ntypes of drugs defined as the most dangerous and addic\u00ad\ntive1) the Act imposes sentences ranging from 10 years to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have \u201ca high potential for abuse,\u201d\n\n\u201cno currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United\nStates,\u201d and \u201ca lack of accepted safety\u201d even \u201cunder medical supervision.\u201d\n\u00a7812(b)(1). Schedule II drugs, such as methamphetamine, likewise\nhave \u201ca high potential for abuse\u201d and a propensity to cause \u201csevere\npsychological or physical dependence\u201d if misused. 21 U. S. C. \u00a7812(b)(2).\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                       5\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nlife imprisonment for large-scale distributions, \u00a7841(b)\n(1)(A), from 5 to 40 years for medium-scale distribu\u00ad\ntions, \u00a7841(b)(1)(B), and not more than 20 years for\nsmaller distributions, \u00a7841(b)(1)(C), the type of offense at\nissue here. These default sentencing rules do not apply,\nhowever, when \u201cdeath or serious bodily injury results from\nthe use of [the distributed] substance.\u201d \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C).\nIn those instances, the defendant \u201cshall be sentenced to a\nterm of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than\ntwenty years or more than life,\u201d a substantial fine, \u201cor\nboth.\u201d2 Ibid.\n   Because the \u201cdeath results\u201d enhancement increased the\nminimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\nexposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See Alleyne v.\nUnited States, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14\u201315);\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). Thus,\nthe crime charged in count 2 of Burrage\u2019s superseding\nindictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or\nintentional distribution of heroin, \u00a7841(a)(1),3 and (ii)\ndeath caused by (\u201cresulting from\u201d) the use of that drug,\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(C).\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may\n\nimpose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the \u201cdeath\nresults\u201d provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have\nconcluded, in effect, that the \u201cor\u201d is a scrivener\u2019s error, see, e.g., United\nStates v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The\nbest evidence of that is the concluding sentence of \u00a7841(b)(1)(C), which\nstates that a court \u201cshall not place on probation or suspend the sen\u00ad\ntence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara\u00ad\ngraph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or\nserious bodily injury results.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n  3 Violation of \u00a7841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime\n\ncharged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that\nlesser included offense.\n6               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n                             III\n\n                              A\n\n    The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,\nconsisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal\ncause. H. Hart & A. Honor\u00e9, Causation in the Law 104\n(1959). When a crime requires \u201cnot merely conduct but\nalso a specified result of conduct,\u201d a defendant generally\nmay not be convicted unless his conduct is \u201cboth (1) the\nactual cause, and (2) the \u2018legal\u2019 cause (often called the\n\u2018proximate cause\u2019) of the result.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, Substan\u00ad\ntive Criminal Law \u00a76.4(a), pp. 464\u2013466 (2d ed. 2003) (here\u00ad\ninafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a72.03,\np. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with\nthe two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find\nit necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of\nheroin was the actual cause of Banka\u2019s death in the sense\nthat \u00a7841(b)(1)(C) requires.\n    The Controlled Substances Act does not define the\nphrase \u201cresults from,\u201d so we give it its ordinary meaning.\nSee Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\n(1995). A thing \u201cresults\u201d when it \u201c[a]rise[s] as an effect,\nissue, or outcome from some action, process or design.\u201d\n2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).\n\u201cResults from\u201d imposes, in other words, a requirement of\nactual causality. \u201cIn the usual course,\u201d this requires proof\n\u201c \u2018that the harm would not have occurred\u2019 in the absence\nof\u2014that is, but for\u2014the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d University\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5\u20136) (quoting Restatement of\nTorts \u00a7431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code\nreflects this traditional understanding; it states that\n\u201c[c]onduct is the cause of a result\u201d if \u201cit is an antecedent\nbut for which the result in question would not have oc\u00ad\ncurred.\u201d \u00a72.03(1)(a). That formulation represents \u201cthe\nminimum requirement for a finding of causation when a\ncrime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Hatfield, 591 F. 3d 945, 948 (CA7 2010)\n(but for \u201cis the minimum concept of cause\u201d); Callahan v.\nCardinal Glennon Hospital, 863 S. W. 2d 852, 862 (Mo.\n1993) (same).\n   Thus, \u201cwhere A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say\nthat A [actually] caused B\u2019s death, since but for A\u2019s con\u00ad\nduct B would not have died.\u201d LaFave 467\u2013468 (italics\nomitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act\ncombines with other factors to produce the result, so long\nas the other factors alone would not have done so\u2014if, so to\nspeak, it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Thus,\nif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those\ndiseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without\nthe incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\nSee, e.g., State v. Frazier, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mo.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974\u2013975, 98 S. W.\n2d 707, 712\u2013713 (1936).\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common under\u00ad\nstanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the\nvisiting team\u2019s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of\nthe first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a\nscore of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English\nlanguage and familiar with the American pastime would\nagree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is\nso because it is natural to say that one event is the out\u00ad\ncome or consequence of another when the former would\nnot have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point\nthat the victory also resulted from a host of other neces\u00ad\nsary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach\u2019s decision\nto put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league\u2019s\ndecision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little\nsense to say that an event resulted from or was the out\u00ad\ncome of some earlier action if the action merely played a\nnonessential contributing role in producing the event.

Our interpretation of statutes\nthat prohibit adverse employment action \u201cbecause of \u201d an\nemployee\u2019s age or complaints about unlawful workplace\ndiscrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed\nTitle VII\u2019s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:\n    \u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n    employer . . . to discriminate against any individual\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an un\u00ad\n    lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or be-\n    cause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42\n    U.

See Univer-\nsity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___\n(2013) (slip op., at 7\u201310). Congress later amended the statute to\ndispense with but-for causality.

S., at\n___ (slip op., at 6\u20137), that a phrase such as \u201cresults from\u201d\nimposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern\u00ad\nment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated\nwith drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with\nthe usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often\ntake drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention\nand Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010\ninvolved more than one drug. See Brief for United States\n28\u201329. This consideration leads the Government to urge\nan interpretation of \u201cresults from\u201d under which use of a\ndrug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for\ncause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause\ndeath, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such\nas mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of\ndeath.\n   In support of its argument, the Government can point to\nthe undoubted reality that courts have not always re\u00ad\nquired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil\u00ad\nity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in\u00ad\nstance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes\nindependently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\nNassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467\n(describing these cases as \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cnumerically in\nthe minority\u201d). To illustrate, if \u201cA stabs B, inflicting a\nfatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde\u00ad\npendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]\nwound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two\nwounds,\u201d A will generally be liable for homicide even\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

We need not accept or reject\nthe special rule developed for these cases, since there was\nno evidence here that Banka\u2019s heroin use was an inde\u00ad\npendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was\nprepared to say that Banka would have died from the\nheroin use alone.\n   Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less\ndemanding (but also less well established) line of author\u00ad\nity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause\u00ad\nin-fact if it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d factor in\nproducing a given result.

The authors go on to offer an alternative\nrule\u2014functionally identical to the one the Government\n12              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nargues here\u2014that \u201c[w]hen the conduct of two or more\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con\u00ad\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\nfact of the event.\u201d Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, \u201cno judicial opin\u00ad\nion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.\u201d Ibid., n. 40.

The language Congress enacted\nrequires death to \u201cresult from\u201d use of the unlawfully dis\u00ad\ntributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which\ndrug use merely contributed. Congress could have written\n\u00a7841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the\nunderlying crime \u201ccontributes to\u201d death or serious bodily\ninjury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to\ncases involving concurrent causes, as five States have\ndone, see Ala. Code \u00a713A\u20132\u20135(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.\n\u00a75\u20132\u2013205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17\u2013A, \u00a733\n(2006); N. D. Cent.

Especially\nin the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the\nrule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,\n107\u2013108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is\ndifferent from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that\ndisfavors the defendant.\n                             B\n  The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of\n\u201cresults from\u201d will \u201cunduly limi[t] criminal responsibility\u201d\nand \u201ccannot be reconciled with sound policy.\u201d Brief for\nUnited States 24. We doubt that the requirement of but\u00ad\nfor causation for this incremental punishment will prove a\npolicy disaster. A cursory search of the Federal Reporter\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  13\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nreveals that but-for causation is not nearly the insuper\u00ad\nable barrier the Government makes it out to be. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Krieger, 628 F. 3d 857, 870\u2013871 (CA7\n2010) (affirming \u201cdeath results\u201d conviction based on expert\ntestimony that, although the victim had several drugs in\nher system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a\nbut-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F. 3d\n1238, 1254\u20131255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same). More\u00ad\nover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for\ncausation, the defendant will still be liable for violating\n\u00a7841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence\nunder \u00a7841(b)(1).\n   Indeed, it is more likely the Government\u2019s proposal that\n\u201ccannot be reconciled with sound policy,\u201d given the need\nfor clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial\nauthorities invoking a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d\nfactor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica\u00ad\ntion of it. Compare Wilson v.

We will not exaggerate the confusion by counting these\nas genuine \u201csubstantial factor\u201d cases.\n14              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nhowever small, to a particular result. See Brief for State\nof Alaska et al. as Amici Curiae 20; see also Black\u2019s Law\nDictionary 250 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201ccontributing\ncause\u201d as \u201c[a] factor that\u2014though not the primary cause\u2014\nplays a part in producing a result\u201d). But at oral argument\nthe Government insisted that its test excludes causes that\nare \u201cnot important enough\u201d or \u201ctoo insubstantial.\u201d Tr. of\nOral Arg. 28. Unsurprisingly, it could not specify how\nimportant or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.\nSee id., at 41\u201342. Presumably the lower courts would be\nleft to guess. That task would be particularly vexing since\nthe evidence in \u00a7841(b)(1) cases is often expressed in terms\nof probabilities and percentages. One of the experts in\nthis case, for example, testified that Banka\u2019s death would\nhave been \u201c[v]ery less likely\u201d had he not used the heroin\nthat Burrage provided. App. 171. Is it sufficient that use\nof a drug made the victim\u2019s death 50 percent more likely?\nFifteen percent? Five? Who knows. Uncertainty of that\nkind cannot be squared with the beyond-a-reasonable\u00ad\ndoubt standard applicable in criminal trials or with the\nneed to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons\ncan comprehend. See United States v. L. Cohen Grocery\nCo., 255 U. S. 81, 89\u201390 (1921).\n   But in the last analysis, these always-fascinating policy\ndiscussions are beside the point.
