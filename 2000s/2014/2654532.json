FIORE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12–574.      Argued November 4, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014\nPetitioner Walden, a Georgia police officer working as a deputized Drug\n  Enforcement Administration agent at a Georgia airport, searched re-\n  spondents and seized a large amount of cash. Respondents allege\n  that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped\n  draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds’ forfei-\n  ture and forwarded it to a United States Attorney’s Office in Georgia.\n  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents’ funds\n  were returned. Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in\n  Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the\n  suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a\n  basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise ju-\n  risdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause\n  affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with signifi-\n  cant Nevada connections.\nHeld: The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.\n Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause constrains a\n State’s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its\n courts, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 291,\n and requires that the nonresident have “certain minimum contacts”\n with the forum State, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326\n U. S. 310, 316. The inquiry into the “minimum contacts” necessary to\n create specific jurisdiction focuses “on the relationship among the de-\n fendant, the forum, and the litigation.” Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,\n Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775. For a State to exercise jurisdiction con-\n sistent with due process, that relationship must arise out of contacts\n that the “defendant himself” creates with the forum, Burger King\n2                           WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475, and must be analyzed with\n    regard to the defendant’s contacts with the forum itself, not with per-\n    sons residing there, see, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319. The\n    plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the fo-\n    rum. These same principles apply when intentional torts are in-\n    volved. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788–789. Pp. 5–10.\n       (b) Petitioner lacks the “minimal contacts” with Nevada that are a\n    prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him. No part of peti-\n    tioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no ju-\n    risdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit\n    reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical\n    focus from petitioner’s contacts with the forum to his contacts with\n    respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner’s chal-\n    lenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself. Respondents\n    emphasize that they suffered the “injury” caused by the delayed re-\n    turn of their funds while residing in Nevada, but Calder made clear\n    that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to\n    the forum. The proper question is whether the defendant’s conduct\n    connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents’\n    claimed injury does not evince such a connection. The injury oc-\n    curred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to\n    be when they desired to use the seized funds. Other possible contacts\n    noted by the Ninth Circuit—that respondents’ Nevada attorney con-\n    tacted petitioner in Georgia, that cash seized in Georgia originated in\n    Nevada, and that funds were returned to respondents in Nevada—\n    are ultimately unavailing.

GINA FIORE \n\n                  ET AL. \n\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n                             [February 25, 2014]\n\n\n  JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  This case asks us to decide whether a court in Nevada\nmay exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant on the\nbasis that he knew his allegedly tortious conduct in Geor-\ngia would delay the return of funds to plaintiffs with\nconnections to Nevada. Because the defendant had no\nother contacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff ’s con-\ntacts with the forum State cannot be “decisive in deter-\nmining whether the defendant’s due process rights are\nviolated,” Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U. S. 320, 332 (1980), we\nhold that the court in Nevada may not exercise personal\njurisdiction under these circumstances.\n                             I\n   Petitioner Anthony Walden serves as a police officer for\nthe city of Covington, Georgia. In August 2006, petitioner\nwas working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as\na deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administra-\ntion (DEA). As part of a task force, petitioner conducted\ninvestigative stops and other law enforcement functions in\nsupport of the DEA’s airport drug interdiction program.\n   On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Admin-\n2                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nistration agents searched respondents Gina Fiore and\nKeith Gipson and their carry-on bags at the San Juan\nairport in Puerto Rico. They found almost $97,000 in\ncash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she\nand Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the\nEl San Juan, and that they had residences in both Cali-\nfornia and Nevada (though they provided only California\nidentification). After respondents were cleared for depar-\nture, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport\nnotified petitioner’s task force in Atlanta that respondents\nhad boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to\ncatch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and\nanother DEA agent approached them at the departure\ngate for their flight to Las Vegas. In response to petition-\ner’s questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were\nprofessional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the\ncash they were carrying was their gambling “ ‘bank’ ” and\nwinnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to\nperform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.1 Petitioner\nadvised respondents that their funds would be returned if\nthey later proved a legitimate source for the cash. Re-\nspondents then boarded their plane.\n   After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash\nto a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA\nheadquarters. The next day, petitioner received a phone\ncall from respondents’ attorney in Nevada seeking return\nof the funds. On two occasions over the next month, peti-\ntioner also received documentation from the attorney\nregarding the legitimacy of the funds.\n   At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped\ndraft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of\n——————\n  1 Respondents allege that the sniff test was “at best, inconclusive,”\n\nand there is no indication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue\nwere ever found on or with the cash.

In the end,\nno forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned\nthe funds to respondents in March 2007.\n   Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking\nmoney damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Nar-\ncotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondents alleged\nthat petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment rights by\n(1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping\nthe money after concluding it did not come from drug-\nrelated activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable\ncause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while know-\ning the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully\nseeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory informa-\ntion; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information\nfrom the United States Attorney’s Office.\n   The District Court granted petitioner’s motion to dis-\nmiss. Relying on this Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones,\n465 U. S. 783 (1984), the court determined that petition-\ner’s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in\nGeorgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal\njurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if\npetitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while\nknowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not\nconfer jurisdiction. Because the court dismissed the com-\nplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, it did not determine\n\n——————\n  2 The alleged affidavit is not in the record. Because this case comes to\nus at the motion-to-dismiss stage, we take respondents’ factual allega-\ntions as true, including their allegations regarding the existence and\ncontent of the affidavit.\n4                         WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether venue was proper.\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of\nAppeals assumed the District Court had correctly deter-\nmined that petitioner’s search and seizure in Georgia\ncould not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada. The\ncourt held, however, that the District Court could properly\nexercise jurisdiction over “the false probable cause affida-\nvit aspect of the case.” 688 F. 3d 558, 577 (2011). Accord-\ning to the Court of Appeals, petitioner “expressly aimed”\nhis submission of the allegedly false affidavit at Nevada by\nsubmitting the affidavit with knowledge that it would\naffect persons with a “significant connection” to Nevada.3\nId., at 581. After determining that the delay in returning\nthe funds to respondents caused them “foreseeable harm”\nin Nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nover petitioner was otherwise reasonable, the court found\nthe District Court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction to be\nproper.4 Id., at 582, 585. The Ninth Circuit denied re-\nhearing en banc, with eight judges, in two separate opin-\nions, dissenting. Id., at 562, 568.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether due process\npermits a Nevada court to exercise jurisdiction over peti-\ntioner. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We hold that it does not and\n——————\n  3 The allegations in the complaint suggested to the Court of Appeals\n\nthat petitioner “definitely knew, at some point after the seizure but\nbefore providing the alleged false probable cause affidavit, that [re-\nspondents] had a significant connection to Nevada.” 688 F. 3d, at 578.\n  4 Judge Ikuta dissented. In her view, the “false affidavit/forfeiture\n\nproceeding aspect” over which the majority found jurisdiction proper\nwas not raised as a separate claim in the complaint, and she found it\n“doubtful that such a constitutional tort even exists.” Id., at 593. After\nthe court denied rehearing en banc, the majority explained in a post-\nscript that it viewed the filing of the false affidavit, which effected a\n“continued seizure” of the funds, as a separate Fourth Amendment\nviolation. Id., at 588–589. Petitioner does not dispute that reading\nhere.\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

Rev. Stat.\n§14.065 (2011). Thus, in order to determine whether\nthe Federal District Court in this case was authorized to\nexercise jurisdiction over petitioner, we ask whether the\nexercise of jurisdiction “comports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process” on the State of Nevada.

FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noffend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.’ ” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S.\n310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457,\n463 (1940)).\n   This case addresses the “minimum contacts” necessary\nto create specific jurisdiction.6 The inquiry whether a\nforum State may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonres-\nident defendant “focuses on ‘the relationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ” Keeton v. Hus-\ntler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775 (1984) (quoting\nShaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977)). For a State\nto exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the\ndefendant’s suit-related conduct must create a substantial\nconnection with the forum State. Two related aspects of\nthis necessary relationship are relevant in this case.\n   First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that\nthe “defendant himself ” creates with the forum State.\nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475 (1985).\nDue process limits on the State’s adjudicative authority\nprincipally protect the liberty of the nonresident defend-\nant—not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties. See\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 291–292. We have\nconsistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-\nfocused “minimum contacts” inquiry by demonstrating\ncontacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the\nforum State. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\nS. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 417 (1984) (“[The] unilateral\n\n——————\n  6 “Specific” or “case-linked” jurisdiction “depends on an ‘affiliatio[n]\n\nbetween the forum and the underlying controversy’ ” (i.e., an “activity or\nan occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore\nsubject to the State’s regulation”). Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2). This is in\ncontrast to “general” or “all purpose” jurisdiction, which permits a court\nto assert jurisdiction over a defendant based on a forum connection\nunrelated to the underlying suit (e.g., domicile). Respondents rely on\nspecific jurisdiction only.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity of another party or a third person is not an appro-\npriate consideration when determining whether a defend-\nant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an\nassertion of jurisdiction”). We have thus rejected a plain-\ntiff ’s argument that a Florida court could exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on\nthe contacts of the trust’s settlor, who was domiciled in\nFlorida and had executed powers of appointment there.\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253–254 (1958). We\nhave likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor\nthat supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\ndealers based only on an automobile purchaser’s act of\ndriving it on Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volks-\nwagen Corp., supra, at 298. Put simply, however sig-\nnificant the plaintiff ’s contacts with the forum may be,\nthose contacts cannot be “decisive in determining whether\nthe defendant’s due process rights are violated.” Rush,\n444 U. S., at 332.\n   Second, our “minimum contacts” analysis looks to the\ndefendant’s contacts with the forum State itself, not the\ndefendant’s contacts with persons who reside there. See,\ne.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process “does\nnot contemplate that a state may make binding a judg-\nment in personam against an individual . . . with which\nthe state has no contacts, ties, or relations”); Hanson,\nsupra, at 251 (“However minimal the burden of defending\nin a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon\nto do so unless he has had the ‘minimal contacts’ with that\nState that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over\nhim”). Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of juris-\ndiction over defendants who have purposefully “reach[ed]\nout beyond” their State and into another by, for example,\nentering a contractual relationship that “envisioned con-\ntinuing and wide-reaching contacts” in the forum State,\nBurger King, supra, at 479–480, or by circulating maga-\n8                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nzines to “deliberately exploi[t]” a market in the forum\nState, Keeton, supra, at 781. And although physical pres-\nence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,\nBurger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State—\neither by the defendant in person or through an agent,\ngoods, mail, or some other means—is certainly a relevant\ncontact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773–774.\n   But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the\ndefendant and the forum. Rather, it is the defendant’s\nconduct that must form the necessary connection with the\nforum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.\nSee Burger King, supra, at 478 (“If the question is whether\nan individual’s contract with an out-of-state party alone\ncan automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts\nin the other party’s home forum, we believe the answer\nclearly is that it cannot”); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal.,\nCity and County of San Francisco, 436 U. S. 84, 93 (1978)\n(declining to “find personal jurisdiction in a State . . .\nmerely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was\nresiding there”). To be sure, a defendant’s contacts with\nthe forum State may be intertwined with his transactions\nor interactions with the plaintiff or other parties. But a\ndefendant’s relationship with a plaintiff or third party,\nstanding alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\nSee Rush, supra, at 332 (“Naturally, the parties’ relation-\nships with each other may be significant in evaluating\ntheir ties to the forum. The requirements of International\nShoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over\nwhom a state court exercises jurisdiction”). Due process\nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum\nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not\nbased on the “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts\nhe makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with\nthe State. Burger King, 471 U. S., at 475 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                2\n   These same principles apply when intentional torts are\ninvolved. In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely\non a defendant’s “random, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts” or on the “unilateral activity” of a plaintiff. Ibid.\n(same). A forum State’s exercise of jurisdiction over an\nout-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on inten-\ntional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary\ncontacts with the forum.\n   Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, illustrates the applica-\ntion of these principles. In Calder, a California actress\nbrought a libel suit in California state court against a\nreporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the Na-\ntional Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The plain-\ntiff ’s libel claims were based on an article written and\nedited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the\nNational Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a\nCalifornia circulation of roughly 600,000.\n   We held that California’s assertion of jurisdiction over\nthe defendants was consistent with due process. Although\nwe recognized that the defendants’ activities “focus[ed]” on\nthe plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry “focuse[d] on ‘the\nrelationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation.’ ” Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204).\nSpecifically, we examined the various contacts the defend-\nants had created with California (and not just with the\nplaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.\n   We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defend-\nants relied on phone calls to “California sources” for the\ninformation in their article; they wrote the story about the\nplaintiff ’s activities in California; they caused reputa-\ntional injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous\narticle that was widely circulated in the State; and the\n“brunt” of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that\nState. 465 U. S., at 788–789. “In sum, California [wa]s\nthe focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.”\n10                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was “there-\nfore proper in California based on the ‘effects’ of their\nFlorida conduct in California.” Ibid.\n   The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based “ef-\nfects” of the alleged libel connected the defendants to\nCalifornia, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that\nconnection was largely a function of the nature of the libel\ntort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it\ncan lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to\n(and read and understood by) third persons. See Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts §577, Comment b (1976); see also\nibid. (“[R]eputation is the estimation in which one’s char-\nacter is held by his neighbors or associates”). Accordingly,\nthe reputational injury caused by the defendants’ story\nwould not have occurred but for the fact that the defend-\nants wrote an article for publication in California that was\nread by a large number of California citizens. Indeed,\nbecause publication to third persons is a necessary ele-\nment of libel, see id., §558, the defendants’ intentional tort\nactually occurred in California. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777\n(“The tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the\noffending material is circulated”). In this way, the “ef-\nfects” caused by the defendants’ article—i.e., the injury to\nthe plaintiff ’s reputation in the estimation of the Califor-\nnia public—connected the defendants’ conduct to Califor-\nnia, not just to a plaintiff who lived there. That connec-\ntion, combined with the various facts that gave the article\na California focus, sufficed to authorize the California\ncourt’s exercise of jurisdiction.7\n——————\n  7 The defendants in Calder argued that no contacts they had with\n\nCalifornia were sufficiently purposeful because their employer was\nresponsible for circulation of the article. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.\n783, 789 (1984). We rejected that argument. Even though the defend-\nants did not circulate the article themselves, they “expressly aimed”\n“their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions” at California be-\ncause they knew the National Enquirer “ha[d] its largest circulation” in\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 251. It is undisputed that no part of\npetitioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada. Peti-\ntioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents,\nand seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport. It is\nalleged that petitioner later helped draft a “false probable\ncause affidavit” in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to\na United States Attorney’s Office in Georgia to support a\npotential action for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688\nF. 3d, at 563. Petitioner never traveled to, conducted\nactivities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or\nanyone to Nevada. In short, when viewed through the\nproper lens—whether the defendant’s actions connect him\nto the forum—petitioner formed no jurisdictionally rele-\nvant contacts with Nevada.\n   The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by\nshifting the analytical focus from petitioner’s contacts with\nthe forum to his contacts with respondents. See Rush, 444\nU. S., at 332. Rather than assessing petitioner’s own\ncontacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to\npetitioner’s knowledge of respondents’ “strong forum\nconnections.” 688 F. 3d, at 577–579, 581. In the court’s\nview, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that\nrespondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satis-\nfied the “minimum contacts” inquiry.8 Id., at 582.\n   This approach to the “minimum contacts” analysis\n——————\nCalifornia, and that the article would “have a potentially devastating\nimpact” there. Id., at 789–790.\n  8 Respondents propose a substantially similar analysis. They suggest\n\nthat “a defendant creates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum\nwhen he (1) intentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3)\nfor imposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is\nresiding in the forum state.” Brief for Respondents 26–27.\n12                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpermissibly allows a plaintiff ’s contacts with the de-\nfendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.\nPetitioner’s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient\ncontacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed\nhis conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada con-\nnections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plain-\ntiff ’s forum connections to the defendant and makes those\nconnections “decisive” in the jurisdictional analysis. See\nRush, supra, at 332. It also obscures the reality that none\nof petitioner’s challenged conduct had anything to do with\nNevada itself.\n   Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they\nsuffered the “injury” caused by petitioner’s allegedly tor-\ntious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling\nfunds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for\nRespondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As\npreviously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a\nforum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.\nRegardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is\njurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the\ndefendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The\nproper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a\nparticular injury or effect but whether the defendant’s\nconduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.\n   Respondents’ claimed injury does not evince a connec-\ntion between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider\nthe continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct\ninjury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada\nin any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respond-\nents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because\nanything independently occurred there, but because Ne-\nvada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they\ndesired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents\nwould have experienced this same lack of access in Cali-\nfornia, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have\ntraveled and found themselves wanting more money than\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Unlike the broad publication of the forum-\nfocused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner’s con-\nduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State\nin a way that makes those effects a proper basis for\njurisdiction.9\n   The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts\nwith Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents’\nNevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that\nis precisely the sort of “unilateral activity” of a third party\nthat “cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the\nforum State.” Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253. Respondents\nallege that some of the cash seized in Georgia “originated”\nin Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created\nby petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada,\nwhen petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventu-\nally returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had\nnothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that\nit was respondents’ unilateral decision to have their funds\nsent to Nevada).\n                       *    *     *\n  Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are\nsufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the\n——————\n  9 Respondents    warn that if we decide petitioner lacks minimum con-\ntacts in this case, it will bring about unfairness in cases where inten-\ntional torts are committed via the Internet or other electronic means\n(e.g., fraudulent access of financial accounts or “phishing” schemes). As\nan initial matter, we reiterate that the “minimum contacts” inquiry\nprincipally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not the\ninterests of the plaintiff. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n444 U. S., 286, 291–292 (1980). In any event, this case does not present\nthe very different questions whether and how a defendant’s virtual\n“presence” and conduct translate into “contacts” with a particular\nState. To the contrary, there is no question where the conduct giving\nrise to this litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from\nrespondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and forwarded\nan affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual contacts for\nanother day.\n14                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“minimum contacts” inquiry in intentional-tort cases is\n“ ‘the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and\nthe litigation.’ ” Calder, 465 U. S., at 788. And it is the\ndefendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must\ncreate contacts with the forum State. In this case, the\napplication of those principles is clear: Petitioner’s rele-\nvant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere\nfact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections\nto the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdic-\ntion. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>", "id": 2654532, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/02/25/walden_v._fiore.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

Argued November 4, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014\nPetitioner Walden, a Georgia police officer working as a deputized Drug\n  Enforcement Administration agent at a Georgia airport, searched re-\n  spondents and seized a large amount of cash. Respondents allege\n  that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped\n  draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds’ forfei-\n  ture and forwarded it to a United States Attorney’s Office in Georgia.\n  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents’ funds\n  were returned. Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in\n  Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the\n  suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a\n  basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise ju-\n  risdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause\n  affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with signifi-\n  cant Nevada connections.\nHeld: The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.\n Pp. 5–14.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause constrains a\n State’s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its\n courts, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 291,\n and requires that the nonresident have “certain minimum contacts”\n with the forum State, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326\n U. S. 310, 316. The inquiry into the “minimum contacts” necessary to\n create specific jurisdiction focuses “on the relationship among the de-\n fendant, the forum, and the litigation.” Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,\n Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775. For a State to exercise jurisdiction con-\n sistent with due process, that relationship must arise out of contacts\n that the “defendant himself” creates with the forum, Burger King\n2                           WALDEN v.

S. 462, 475, and must be analyzed with\n    regard to the defendant’s contacts with the forum itself, not with per-\n    sons residing there, see, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319. The\n    plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the fo-\n    rum. These same principles apply when intentional torts are in-\n    volved. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788–789. Pp. 5–10.\n       (b) Petitioner lacks the “minimal contacts” with Nevada that are a\n    prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him. No part of peti-\n    tioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no ju-\n    risdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit\n    reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical\n    focus from petitioner’s contacts with the forum to his contacts with\n    respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner’s chal-\n    lenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself. Respondents\n    emphasize that they suffered the “injury” caused by the delayed re-\n    turn of their funds while residing in Nevada, but Calder made clear\n    that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to\n    the forum. The proper question is whether the defendant’s conduct\n    connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents’\n    claimed injury does not evince such a connection. The injury oc-\n    curred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to\n    be when they desired to use the seized funds. Other possible contacts\n    noted by the Ninth Circuit—that respondents’ Nevada attorney con-\n    tacted petitioner in Georgia, that cash seized in Georgia originated in\n    Nevada, and that funds were returned to respondents in Nevada—\n    are ultimately unavailing.

Because the defendant had no\nother contacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff ’s con-\ntacts with the forum State cannot be “decisive in deter-\nmining whether the defendant’s due process rights are\nviolated,” Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U. S. 320, 332 (1980), we\nhold that the court in Nevada may not exercise personal\njurisdiction under these circumstances.\n                             I\n   Petitioner Anthony Walden serves as a police officer for\nthe city of Covington, Georgia. In August 2006, petitioner\nwas working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as\na deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administra-\ntion (DEA). As part of a task force, petitioner conducted\ninvestigative stops and other law enforcement functions in\nsupport of the DEA’s airport drug interdiction program.\n   On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Admin-\n2                        WALDEN v.

They found almost $97,000 in\ncash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she\nand Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the\nEl San Juan, and that they had residences in both Cali-\nfornia and Nevada (though they provided only California\nidentification). After respondents were cleared for depar-\nture, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport\nnotified petitioner’s task force in Atlanta that respondents\nhad boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to\ncatch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and\nanother DEA agent approached them at the departure\ngate for their flight to Las Vegas. In response to petition-\ner’s questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were\nprofessional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the\ncash they were carrying was their gambling “ ‘bank’ ” and\nwinnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to\nperform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.1 Petitioner\nadvised respondents that their funds would be returned if\nthey later proved a legitimate source for the cash. Re-\nspondents then boarded their plane.\n   After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash\nto a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA\nheadquarters. The next day, petitioner received a phone\ncall from respondents’ attorney in Nevada seeking return\nof the funds. On two occasions over the next month, peti-\ntioner also received documentation from the attorney\nregarding the legitimacy of the funds.\n   At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped\ndraft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of\n——————\n  1 Respondents allege that the sniff test was “at best, inconclusive,”\n\nand there is no indication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue\nwere ever found on or with the cash.

In the end,\nno forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned\nthe funds to respondents in March 2007.\n   Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking\nmoney damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Nar-\ncotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondents alleged\nthat petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment rights by\n(1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping\nthe money after concluding it did not come from drug-\nrelated activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable\ncause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while know-\ning the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully\nseeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory informa-\ntion; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information\nfrom the United States Attorney’s Office.\n   The District Court granted petitioner’s motion to dis-\nmiss. Relying on this Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones,\n465 U. S. 783 (1984), the court determined that petition-\ner’s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in\nGeorgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal\njurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if\npetitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while\nknowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not\nconfer jurisdiction.

The Court of\nAppeals assumed the District Court had correctly deter-\nmined that petitioner’s search and seizure in Georgia\ncould not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada. The\ncourt held, however, that the District Court could properly\nexercise jurisdiction over “the false probable cause affida-\nvit aspect of the case.” 688 F. 3d 558, 577 (2011).

In her view, the “false affidavit/forfeiture\n\nproceeding aspect” over which the majority found jurisdiction proper\nwas not raised as a separate claim in the complaint, and she found it\n“doubtful that such a constitutional tort even exists.” Id., at 593. After\nthe court denied rehearing en banc, the majority explained in a post-\nscript that it viewed the filing of the false affidavit, which effected a\n“continued seizure” of the funds, as a separate Fourth Amendment\nviolation.

For a State\nto exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the\ndefendant’s suit-related conduct must create a substantial\nconnection with the forum State. Two related aspects of\nthis necessary relationship are relevant in this case.\n   First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that\nthe “defendant himself ” creates with the forum State.\nBurger King Corp. v.

Respondents rely on\nspecific jurisdiction only.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity of another party or a third person is not an appro-\npriate consideration when determining whether a defend-\nant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an\nassertion of jurisdiction”). We have thus rejected a plain-\ntiff ’s argument that a Florida court could exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on\nthe contacts of the trust’s settlor, who was domiciled in\nFlorida and had executed powers of appointment there.\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253–254 (1958). We\nhave likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor\nthat supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\ndealers based only on an automobile purchaser’s act of\ndriving it on Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volks-\nwagen Corp., supra, at 298. Put simply, however sig-\nnificant the plaintiff ’s contacts with the forum may be,\nthose contacts cannot be “decisive in determining whether\nthe defendant’s due process rights are violated.” Rush,\n444 U. S., at 332.\n   Second, our “minimum contacts” analysis looks to the\ndefendant’s contacts with the forum State itself, not the\ndefendant’s contacts with persons who reside there. See,\ne.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process “does\nnot contemplate that a state may make binding a judg-\nment in personam against an individual . . . with which\nthe state has no contacts, ties, or relations”); Hanson,\nsupra, at 251 (“However minimal the burden of defending\nin a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon\nto do so unless he has had the ‘minimal contacts’ with that\nState that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over\nhim”). Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of juris-\ndiction over defendants who have purposefully “reach[ed]\nout beyond” their State and into another by, for example,\nentering a contractual relationship that “envisioned con-\ntinuing and wide-reaching contacts” in the forum State,\nBurger King, supra, at 479–480, or by circulating maga-\n8                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nzines to “deliberately exploi[t]” a market in the forum\nState, Keeton, supra, at 781. And although physical pres-\nence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,\nBurger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State—\neither by the defendant in person or through an agent,\ngoods, mail, or some other means—is certainly a relevant\ncontact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773–774.\n   But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the\ndefendant and the forum. Rather, it is the defendant’s\nconduct that must form the necessary connection with the\nforum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.\nSee Burger King, supra, at 478 (“If the question is whether\nan individual’s contract with an out-of-state party alone\ncan automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts\nin the other party’s home forum, we believe the answer\nclearly is that it cannot”); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal.,\nCity and County of San Francisco, 436 U. S. 84, 93 (1978)\n(declining to “find personal jurisdiction in a State . . .\nmerely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was\nresiding there”). To be sure, a defendant’s contacts with\nthe forum State may be intertwined with his transactions\nor interactions with the plaintiff or other parties. But a\ndefendant’s relationship with a plaintiff or third party,\nstanding alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\nSee Rush, supra, at 332 (“Naturally, the parties’ relation-\nships with each other may be significant in evaluating\ntheir ties to the forum. The requirements of International\nShoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over\nwhom a state court exercises jurisdiction”). Due process\nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum\nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not\nbased on the “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts\nhe makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with\nthe State. Burger King, 471 U. S., at 475 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)              9\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n                                2\n   These same principles apply when intentional torts are\ninvolved. In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely\non a defendant’s “random, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts” or on the “unilateral activity” of a plaintiff. Ibid.\n(same). A forum State’s exercise of jurisdiction over an\nout-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on inten-\ntional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary\ncontacts with the forum.\n   Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, illustrates the applica-\ntion of these principles. In Calder, a California actress\nbrought a libel suit in California state court against a\nreporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the Na-\ntional Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The plain-\ntiff ’s libel claims were based on an article written and\nedited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the\nNational Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a\nCalifornia circulation of roughly 600,000.\n   We held that California’s assertion of jurisdiction over\nthe defendants was consistent with due process. Although\nwe recognized that the defendants’ activities “focus[ed]” on\nthe plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry “focuse[d] on ‘the\nrelationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation.’ ” Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204).\nSpecifically, we examined the various contacts the defend-\nants had created with California (and not just with the\nplaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.\n   We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defend-\nants relied on phone calls to “California sources” for the\ninformation in their article; they wrote the story about the\nplaintiff ’s activities in California; they caused reputa-\ntional injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous\narticle that was widely circulated in the State; and the\n“brunt” of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that\nState. 465 U. S., at 788–789. “In sum, California [wa]s\nthe focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.”\n10                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was “there-\nfore proper in California based on the ‘effects’ of their\nFlorida conduct in California.” Ibid.\n   The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based “ef-\nfects” of the alleged libel connected the defendants to\nCalifornia, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that\nconnection was largely a function of the nature of the libel\ntort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it\ncan lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to\n(and read and understood by) third persons. See Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts §577, Comment b (1976); see also\nibid. (“[R]eputation is the estimation in which one’s char-\nacter is held by his neighbors or associates”). Accordingly,\nthe reputational injury caused by the defendants’ story\nwould not have occurred but for the fact that the defend-\nants wrote an article for publication in California that was\nread by a large number of California citizens. Indeed,\nbecause publication to third persons is a necessary ele-\nment of libel, see id., §558, the defendants’ intentional tort\nactually occurred in California. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777\n(“The tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the\noffending material is circulated”). In this way, the “ef-\nfects” caused by the defendants’ article—i.e., the injury to\nthe plaintiff ’s reputation in the estimation of the Califor-\nnia public—connected the defendants’ conduct to Califor-\nnia, not just to a plaintiff who lived there. That connec-\ntion, combined with the various facts that gave the article\na California focus, sufficed to authorize the California\ncourt’s exercise of jurisdiction.7\n——————\n  7 The defendants in Calder argued that no contacts they had with\n\nCalifornia were sufficiently purposeful because their employer was\nresponsible for circulation of the article. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.\n783, 789 (1984). We rejected that argument. Even though the defend-\nants did not circulate the article themselves, they “expressly aimed”\n“their intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions” at California be-\ncause they knew the National Enquirer “ha[d] its largest circulation” in\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 251. It is undisputed that no part of\npetitioner’s course of conduct occurred in Nevada. Peti-\ntioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents,\nand seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport. It is\nalleged that petitioner later helped draft a “false probable\ncause affidavit” in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to\na United States Attorney’s Office in Georgia to support a\npotential action for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688\nF. 3d, at 563. Petitioner never traveled to, conducted\nactivities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or\nanyone to Nevada. In short, when viewed through the\nproper lens—whether the defendant’s actions connect him\nto the forum—petitioner formed no jurisdictionally rele-\nvant contacts with Nevada.\n   The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by\nshifting the analytical focus from petitioner’s contacts with\nthe forum to his contacts with respondents. See Rush, 444\nU. S., at 332. Rather than assessing petitioner’s own\ncontacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to\npetitioner’s knowledge of respondents’ “strong forum\nconnections.” 688 F. 3d, at 577–579, 581. In the court’s\nview, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that\nrespondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satis-\nfied the “minimum contacts” inquiry.8 Id., at 582.\n   This approach to the “minimum contacts” analysis\n——————\nCalifornia, and that the article would “have a potentially devastating\nimpact” there. Id., at 789–790.\n  8 Respondents propose a substantially similar analysis. They suggest\n\nthat “a defendant creates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum\nwhen he (1) intentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3)\nfor imposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is\nresiding in the forum state.” Brief for Respondents 26–27.\n12                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpermissibly allows a plaintiff ’s contacts with the de-\nfendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.\nPetitioner’s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient\ncontacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed\nhis conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada con-\nnections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plain-\ntiff ’s forum connections to the defendant and makes those\nconnections “decisive” in the jurisdictional analysis. See\nRush, supra, at 332. It also obscures the reality that none\nof petitioner’s challenged conduct had anything to do with\nNevada itself.\n   Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they\nsuffered the “injury” caused by petitioner’s allegedly tor-\ntious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling\nfunds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for\nRespondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As\npreviously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a\nforum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.\nRegardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is\njurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the\ndefendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The\nproper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a\nparticular injury or effect but whether the defendant’s\nconduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.\n   Respondents’ claimed injury does not evince a connec-\ntion between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider\nthe continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct\ninjury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada\nin any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respond-\nents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because\nanything independently occurred there, but because Ne-\nvada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they\ndesired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents\nwould have experienced this same lack of access in Cali-\nfornia, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have\ntraveled and found themselves wanting more money than\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   13\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthey had. Unlike the broad publication of the forum-\nfocused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner’s con-\nduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State\nin a way that makes those effects a proper basis for\njurisdiction.9\n   The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts\nwith Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents’\nNevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that\nis precisely the sort of “unilateral activity” of a third party\nthat “cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the\nforum State.” Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253. Respondents\nallege that some of the cash seized in Georgia “originated”\nin Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created\nby petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada,\nwhen petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventu-\nally returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had\nnothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that\nit was respondents’ unilateral decision to have their funds\nsent to Nevada).\n                       *    *     *\n  Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are\nsufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the\n——————\n  9 Respondents    warn that if we decide petitioner lacks minimum con-\ntacts in this case, it will bring about unfairness in cases where inten-\ntional torts are committed via the Internet or other electronic means\n(e.g., fraudulent access of financial accounts or “phishing” schemes). As\nan initial matter, we reiterate that the “minimum contacts” inquiry\nprincipally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not the\ninterests of the plaintiff. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n444 U. S., 286, 291–292 (1980). In any event, this case does not present\nthe very different questions whether and how a defendant’s virtual\n“presence” and conduct translate into “contacts” with a particular\nState. To the contrary, there is no question where the conduct giving\nrise to this litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from\nrespondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and forwarded\nan affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual contacts for\nanother day.\n14                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n“minimum contacts” inquiry in intentional-tort cases is\n“ ‘the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and\nthe litigation.’ ” Calder, 465 U. S., at 788. And it is the\ndefendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must\ncreate contacts with the forum State. In this case, the\napplication of those principles is clear: Petitioner’s rele-\nvant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere\nfact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections\nto the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdic-\ntion. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2654532/", "sha1": "d0a35d62734f746f4d330e9e1b5250cf8e1d9c5c", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-021", "time_retrieved": "2014-02-25T17:02:01.174428"}
