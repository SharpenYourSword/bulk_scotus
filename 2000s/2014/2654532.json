FIORE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12\u2013574.      Argued November 4, 2013\u2014Decided February 25, 2014\nPetitioner Walden, a Georgia police officer working as a deputized Drug\n  Enforcement Administration agent at a Georgia airport, searched re-\n  spondents and seized a large amount of cash. Respondents allege\n  that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped\n  draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds\u2019 forfei-\n  ture and forwarded it to a United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia.\n  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents\u2019 funds\n  were returned. Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in\n  Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the\n  suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a\n  basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise ju-\n  risdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause\n  affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with signifi-\n  cant Nevada connections.\nHeld: The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.\n Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause constrains a\n State\u2019s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its\n courts, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 291,\n and requires that the nonresident have \u201ccertain minimum contacts\u201d\n with the forum State, International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326\n U. S. 310, 316. The inquiry into the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary to\n create specific jurisdiction focuses \u201con the relationship among the de-\n fendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u201d Keeton v. Hustler Magazine,\n Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775. For a State to exercise jurisdiction con-\n sistent with due process, that relationship must arise out of contacts\n that the \u201cdefendant himself\u201d creates with the forum, Burger King\n2                           WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475, and must be analyzed with\n    regard to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum itself, not with per-\n    sons residing there, see, e.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319. The\n    plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the fo-\n    rum. These same principles apply when intentional torts are in-\n    volved. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, 788\u2013789. Pp. 5\u201310.\n       (b) Petitioner lacks the \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with Nevada that are a\n    prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction over him. No part of peti-\n    tioner\u2019s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no ju-\n    risdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit\n    reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical\n    focus from petitioner\u2019s contacts with the forum to his contacts with\n    respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner\u2019s chal-\n    lenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself. Respondents\n    emphasize that they suffered the \u201cinjury\u201d caused by the delayed re-\n    turn of their funds while residing in Nevada, but Calder made clear\n    that mere injury to a forum resident is not a sufficient connection to\n    the forum. The proper question is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct\n    connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents\u2019\n    claimed injury does not evince such a connection. The injury oc-\n    curred in Nevada simply because that is where respondents chose to\n    be when they desired to use the seized funds. Other possible contacts\n    noted by the Ninth Circuit\u2014that respondents\u2019 Nevada attorney con-\n    tacted petitioner in Georgia, that cash seized in Georgia originated in\n    Nevada, and that funds were returned to respondents in Nevada\u2014\n    are ultimately unavailing.

Because the defendant had no\nother contacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff \u2019s con-\ntacts with the forum State cannot be \u201cdecisive in deter-\nmining whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights are\nviolated,\u201d Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U. S. 320, 332 (1980), we\nhold that the court in Nevada may not exercise personal\njurisdiction under these circumstances.\n                             I\n   Petitioner Anthony Walden serves as a police officer for\nthe city of Covington, Georgia. In August 2006, petitioner\nwas working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as\na deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administra-\ntion (DEA). As part of a task force, petitioner conducted\ninvestigative stops and other law enforcement functions in\nsupport of the DEA\u2019s airport drug interdiction program.\n   On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Admin-\n2                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nistration agents searched respondents Gina Fiore and\nKeith Gipson and their carry-on bags at the San Juan\nairport in Puerto Rico. They found almost $97,000 in\ncash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she\nand Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the\nEl San Juan, and that they had residences in both Cali-\nfornia and Nevada (though they provided only California\nidentification). After respondents were cleared for depar-\nture, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport\nnotified petitioner\u2019s task force in Atlanta that respondents\nhad boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to\ncatch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and\nanother DEA agent approached them at the departure\ngate for their flight to Las Vegas. In response to petition-\ner\u2019s questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were\nprofessional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the\ncash they were carrying was their gambling \u201c \u2018bank\u2019 \u201d and\nwinnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to\nperform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.1 Petitioner\nadvised respondents that their funds would be returned if\nthey later proved a legitimate source for the cash. Re-\nspondents then boarded their plane.\n   After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash\nto a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA\nheadquarters. The next day, petitioner received a phone\ncall from respondents\u2019 attorney in Nevada seeking return\nof the funds. On two occasions over the next month, peti-\ntioner also received documentation from the attorney\nregarding the legitimacy of the funds.\n   At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped\ndraft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondents allege that the sniff test was \u201cat best, inconclusive,\u201d\n\nand there is no indication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue\nwere ever found on or with the cash. App. 21.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nthe funds and forwarded that affidavit to a United States\nAttorney\u2019s Office in Georgia.2 According to respondents,\nthe affidavit was false and misleading because petitioner\nmisrepresented the encounter at the airport and omitted\nexculpatory information regarding the lack of drug evi-\ndence and the legitimate source of the funds. In the end,\nno forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned\nthe funds to respondents in March 2007.\n   Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking\nmoney damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Nar-\ncotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondents alleged\nthat petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment rights by\n(1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping\nthe money after concluding it did not come from drug-\nrelated activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable\ncause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while know-\ning the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully\nseeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory informa-\ntion; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information\nfrom the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\n   The District Court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Calder v. Jones,\n465 U. S. 783 (1984), the court determined that petition-\ner\u2019s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in\nGeorgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal\njurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if\npetitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while\nknowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not\nconfer jurisdiction. Because the court dismissed the com-\nplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, it did not determine\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The alleged affidavit is not in the record. Because this case comes to\nus at the motion-to-dismiss stage, we take respondents\u2019 factual allega-\ntions as true, including their allegations regarding the existence and\ncontent of the affidavit.\n4                         WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwhether venue was proper.\n   On appeal, a divided panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Court of\nAppeals assumed the District Court had correctly deter-\nmined that petitioner\u2019s search and seizure in Georgia\ncould not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada. The\ncourt held, however, that the District Court could properly\nexercise jurisdiction over \u201cthe false probable cause affida-\nvit aspect of the case.\u201d 688 F. 3d 558, 577 (2011). Accord-\ning to the Court of Appeals, petitioner \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d\nhis submission of the allegedly false affidavit at Nevada by\nsubmitting the affidavit with knowledge that it would\naffect persons with a \u201csignificant connection\u201d to Nevada.3\nId., at 581. After determining that the delay in returning\nthe funds to respondents caused them \u201cforeseeable harm\u201d\nin Nevada and that the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nover petitioner was otherwise reasonable, the court found\nthe District Court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction to be\nproper.4 Id., at 582, 585. The Ninth Circuit denied re-\nhearing en banc, with eight judges, in two separate opin-\nions, dissenting. Id., at 562, 568.\n   We granted certiorari to decide whether due process\npermits a Nevada court to exercise jurisdiction over peti-\ntioner. 568 U. S. ___ (2013). We hold that it does not and\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  3 The allegations in the complaint suggested to the Court of Appeals\n\nthat petitioner \u201cdefinitely knew, at some point after the seizure but\nbefore providing the alleged false probable cause affidavit, that [re-\nspondents] had a significant connection to Nevada.\u201d 688 F. 3d, at 578.\n  4 Judge Ikuta dissented. In her view, the \u201cfalse affidavit/forfeiture\n\nproceeding aspect\u201d over which the majority found jurisdiction proper\nwas not raised as a separate claim in the complaint, and she found it\n\u201cdoubtful that such a constitutional tort even exists.\u201d Id., at 593. After\nthe court denied rehearing en banc, the majority explained in a post-\nscript that it viewed the filing of the false affidavit, which effected a\n\u201ccontinued seizure\u201d of the funds, as a separate Fourth Amendment\nviolation. Id., at 588\u2013589. Petitioner does not dispute that reading\nhere.\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                 5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ntherefore reverse.5\n                                II\n\n                                A\n\n    \u201cFederal courts ordinarily follow state law in determin-\ning the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons.\u201d Daimler\nAG v. Bauman, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6).\nThis is because a federal district court\u2019s authority to assert\npersonal jurisdiction in most cases is linked to service of\nprocess on a defendant \u201cwho is subject to the jurisdiction\nof a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the\ndistrict court is located.\u201d Fed. Rule of Civ. Proc. 4(k)(1)(A).\nHere, Nevada has authorized its courts to exercise juris-\ndiction over persons \u201con any basis not inconsistent with\n. . . the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Nev. Rev. Stat.\n\u00a714.065 (2011). Thus, in order to determine whether\nthe Federal District Court in this case was authorized to\nexercise jurisdiction over petitioner, we ask whether the\nexercise of jurisdiction \u201ccomports with the limits imposed\nby federal due process\u201d on the State of Nevada. Daimler,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n                              B\n                              1\n  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nconstrains a State\u2019s authority to bind a nonresident\ndefendant to a judgment of its courts.         World-Wide\nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U. S. 286, 291 (1980).\nAlthough a nonresident\u2019s physical presence within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the court is not required, the\nnonresident generally must have \u201ccertain minimum con-\ntacts . . . such that the maintenance of the suit does not\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  5 We  also granted certiorari on the question whether Nevada is a\nproper venue for the suit under 28 U. S. C. \u00a71391(b)(2). Because we\nresolve the case on jurisdictional grounds, we do not decide whether\nvenue was proper in Nevada.\n6                         WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\noffend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial\njustice.\u2019 \u201d International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S.\n310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457,\n463 (1940)).\n   This case addresses the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary\nto create specific jurisdiction.6 The inquiry whether a\nforum State may assert specific jurisdiction over a nonres-\nident defendant \u201cfocuses on \u2018the relationship among the\ndefendant, the forum, and the litigation.\u2019 \u201d Keeton v. Hus-\ntler Magazine, Inc., 465 U. S. 770, 775 (1984) (quoting\nShaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 204 (1977)). For a State\nto exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the\ndefendant\u2019s suit-related conduct must create a substantial\nconnection with the forum State. Two related aspects of\nthis necessary relationship are relevant in this case.\n   First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that\nthe \u201cdefendant himself \u201d creates with the forum State.\nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462, 475 (1985).\nDue process limits on the State\u2019s adjudicative authority\nprincipally protect the liberty of the nonresident defend-\nant\u2014not the convenience of plaintiffs or third parties. See\nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp., supra, at 291\u2013292. We have\nconsistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-\nfocused \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry by demonstrating\ncontacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the\nforum State. See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia,\nS. A. v. Hall, 466 U. S. 408, 417 (1984) (\u201c[The] unilateral\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  6 \u201cSpecific\u201d or \u201ccase-linked\u201d jurisdiction \u201cdepends on an \u2018affiliatio[n]\n\nbetween the forum and the underlying controversy\u2019 \u201d (i.e., an \u201cactivity or\nan occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore\nsubject to the State\u2019s regulation\u201d). Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations,\nS. A. v. Brown, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 2). This is in\ncontrast to \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction, which permits a court\nto assert jurisdiction over a defendant based on a forum connection\nunrelated to the underlying suit (e.g., domicile). Respondents rely on\nspecific jurisdiction only.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nactivity of another party or a third person is not an appro-\npriate consideration when determining whether a defend-\nant has sufficient contacts with a forum State to justify an\nassertion of jurisdiction\u201d). We have thus rejected a plain-\ntiff \u2019s argument that a Florida court could exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on\nthe contacts of the trust\u2019s settlor, who was domiciled in\nFlorida and had executed powers of appointment there.\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253\u2013254 (1958). We\nhave likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor\nthat supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\ndealers based only on an automobile purchaser\u2019s act of\ndriving it on Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volks-\nwagen Corp., supra, at 298. Put simply, however sig-\nnificant the plaintiff \u2019s contacts with the forum may be,\nthose contacts cannot be \u201cdecisive in determining whether\nthe defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated.\u201d Rush,\n444 U. S., at 332.\n   Second, our \u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis looks to the\ndefendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State itself, not the\ndefendant\u2019s contacts with persons who reside there. See,\ne.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process \u201cdoes\nnot contemplate that a state may make binding a judg-\nment in personam against an individual . . . with which\nthe state has no contacts, ties, or relations\u201d); Hanson,\nsupra, at 251 (\u201cHowever minimal the burden of defending\nin a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon\nto do so unless he has had the \u2018minimal contacts\u2019 with that\nState that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over\nhim\u201d). Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of juris-\ndiction over defendants who have purposefully \u201creach[ed]\nout beyond\u201d their State and into another by, for example,\nentering a contractual relationship that \u201cenvisioned con-\ntinuing and wide-reaching contacts\u201d in the forum State,\nBurger King, supra, at 479\u2013480, or by circulating maga-\n8                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nzines to \u201cdeliberately exploi[t]\u201d a market in the forum\nState, Keeton, supra, at 781. And although physical pres-\nence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,\nBurger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State\u2014\neither by the defendant in person or through an agent,\ngoods, mail, or some other means\u2014is certainly a relevant\ncontact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773\u2013774.\n   But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the\ndefendant and the forum. Rather, it is the defendant\u2019s\nconduct that must form the necessary connection with the\nforum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.\nSee Burger King, supra, at 478 (\u201cIf the question is whether\nan individual\u2019s contract with an out-of-state party alone\ncan automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts\nin the other party\u2019s home forum, we believe the answer\nclearly is that it cannot\u201d); Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal.,\nCity and County of San Francisco, 436 U. S. 84, 93 (1978)\n(declining to \u201cfind personal jurisdiction in a State . . .\nmerely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was\nresiding there\u201d). To be sure, a defendant\u2019s contacts with\nthe forum State may be intertwined with his transactions\nor interactions with the plaintiff or other parties. But a\ndefendant\u2019s relationship with a plaintiff or third party,\nstanding alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\nSee Rush, supra, at 332 (\u201cNaturally, the parties\u2019 relation-\nships with each other may be significant in evaluating\ntheir ties to the forum. The requirements of International\nShoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over\nwhom a state court exercises jurisdiction\u201d). Due process\nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum\nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not\nbased on the \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\u201d contacts\nhe makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with\nthe State.

In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely\non a defendant\u2019s \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts\u201d or on the \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of a plaintiff. Ibid.\n(same). A forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over an\nout-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on inten-\ntional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary\ncontacts with the forum.\n   Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, illustrates the applica-\ntion of these principles. In Calder, a California actress\nbrought a libel suit in California state court against a\nreporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the Na-\ntional Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The plain-\ntiff \u2019s libel claims were based on an article written and\nedited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the\nNational Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a\nCalifornia circulation of roughly 600,000.\n   We held that California\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over\nthe defendants was consistent with due process. Although\nwe recognized that the defendants\u2019 activities \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on\nthe plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry \u201cfocuse[d] on \u2018the\nrelationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204).\nSpecifically, we examined the various contacts the defend-\nants had created with California (and not just with the\nplaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.\n   We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defend-\nants relied on phone calls to \u201cCalifornia sources\u201d for the\ninformation in their article; they wrote the story about the\nplaintiff \u2019s activities in California; they caused reputa-\ntional injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous\narticle that was widely circulated in the State; and the\n\u201cbrunt\u201d of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that\nState. 465 U. S., at 788\u2013789. \u201cIn sum, California [wa]s\nthe focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.\u201d\n10                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was \u201cthere-\nfore proper in California based on the \u2018effects\u2019 of their\nFlorida conduct in California.\u201d Ibid.\n   The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based \u201cef-\nfects\u201d of the alleged libel connected the defendants to\nCalifornia, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that\nconnection was largely a function of the nature of the libel\ntort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it\ncan lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to\n(and read and understood by) third persons. See Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts \u00a7577, Comment b (1976); see also\nibid. (\u201c[R]eputation is the estimation in which one\u2019s char-\nacter is held by his neighbors or associates\u201d). Accordingly,\nthe reputational injury caused by the defendants\u2019 story\nwould not have occurred but for the fact that the defend-\nants wrote an article for publication in California that was\nread by a large number of California citizens. Indeed,\nbecause publication to third persons is a necessary ele-\nment of libel, see id., \u00a7558, the defendants\u2019 intentional tort\nactually occurred in California. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777\n(\u201cThe tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the\noffending material is circulated\u201d). In this way, the \u201cef-\nfects\u201d caused by the defendants\u2019 article\u2014i.e., the injury to\nthe plaintiff \u2019s reputation in the estimation of the Califor-\nnia public\u2014connected the defendants\u2019 conduct to Califor-\nnia, not just to a plaintiff who lived there. That connec-\ntion, combined with the various facts that gave the article\na California focus, sufficed to authorize the California\ncourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The defendants in Calder argued that no contacts they had with\n\nCalifornia were sufficiently purposeful because their employer was\nresponsible for circulation of the article. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.\n783, 789 (1984). We rejected that argument. Even though the defend-\nants did not circulate the article themselves, they \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d\n\u201ctheir intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions\u201d at California be-\ncause they knew the National Enquirer \u201cha[d] its largest circulation\u201d in\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 251. It is undisputed that no part of\npetitioner\u2019s course of conduct occurred in Nevada. Peti-\ntioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents,\nand seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport. It is\nalleged that petitioner later helped draft a \u201cfalse probable\ncause affidavit\u201d in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to\na United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia to support a\npotential action for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688\nF. 3d, at 563. Petitioner never traveled to, conducted\nactivities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or\nanyone to Nevada. In short, when viewed through the\nproper lens\u2014whether the defendant\u2019s actions connect him\nto the forum\u2014petitioner formed no jurisdictionally rele-\nvant contacts with Nevada.\n   The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by\nshifting the analytical focus from petitioner\u2019s contacts with\nthe forum to his contacts with respondents. See Rush, 444\nU. S., at 332. Rather than assessing petitioner\u2019s own\ncontacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to\npetitioner\u2019s knowledge of respondents\u2019 \u201cstrong forum\nconnections.\u201d 688 F. 3d, at 577\u2013579, 581. In the court\u2019s\nview, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that\nrespondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satis-\nfied the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry.8 Id., at 582.\n   This approach to the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCalifornia, and that the article would \u201chave a potentially devastating\nimpact\u201d there. Id., at 789\u2013790.\n  8 Respondents propose a substantially similar analysis. They suggest\n\nthat \u201ca defendant creates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum\nwhen he (1) intentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3)\nfor imposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is\nresiding in the forum state.\u201d Brief for Respondents 26\u201327.\n12                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpermissibly allows a plaintiff \u2019s contacts with the de-\nfendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.\nPetitioner\u2019s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient\ncontacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed\nhis conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada con-\nnections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plain-\ntiff \u2019s forum connections to the defendant and makes those\nconnections \u201cdecisive\u201d in the jurisdictional analysis. See\nRush, supra, at 332. It also obscures the reality that none\nof petitioner\u2019s challenged conduct had anything to do with\nNevada itself.\n   Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they\nsuffered the \u201cinjury\u201d caused by petitioner\u2019s allegedly tor-\ntious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling\nfunds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for\nRespondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As\npreviously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a\nforum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.\nRegardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is\njurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the\ndefendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The\nproper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a\nparticular injury or effect but whether the defendant\u2019s\nconduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.\n   Respondents\u2019 claimed injury does not evince a connec-\ntion between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider\nthe continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct\ninjury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada\nin any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respond-\nents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because\nanything independently occurred there, but because Ne-\nvada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they\ndesired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents\nwould have experienced this same lack of access in Cali-\nfornia, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have\ntraveled and found themselves wanting more money than\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Unlike the broad publication of the forum-\nfocused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner\u2019s con-\nduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State\nin a way that makes those effects a proper basis for\njurisdiction.9\n   The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts\nwith Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents\u2019\nNevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that\nis precisely the sort of \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of a third party\nthat \u201ccannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the\nforum State.\u201d Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253. Respondents\nallege that some of the cash seized in Georgia \u201coriginated\u201d\nin Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created\nby petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada,\nwhen petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventu-\nally returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had\nnothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that\nit was respondents\u2019 unilateral decision to have their funds\nsent to Nevada).\n                       *    *     *\n  Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are\nsufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Respondents    warn that if we decide petitioner lacks minimum con-\ntacts in this case, it will bring about unfairness in cases where inten-\ntional torts are committed via the Internet or other electronic means\n(e.g., fraudulent access of financial accounts or \u201cphishing\u201d schemes). As\nan initial matter, we reiterate that the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry\nprincipally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not the\ninterests of the plaintiff. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n444 U. S., 286, 291\u2013292 (1980). In any event, this case does not present\nthe very different questions whether and how a defendant\u2019s virtual\n\u201cpresence\u201d and conduct translate into \u201ccontacts\u201d with a particular\nState. To the contrary, there is no question where the conduct giving\nrise to this litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from\nrespondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and forwarded\nan affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual contacts for\nanother day.\n14                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry in intentional-tort cases is\n\u201c \u2018the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and\nthe litigation.\u2019 \u201d Calder, 465 U. S., at 788. And it is the\ndefendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must\ncreate contacts with the forum State. In this case, the\napplication of those principles is clear: Petitioner\u2019s rele-\nvant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere\nfact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections\nto the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdic-\ntion. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Argued November 4, 2013\u2014Decided February 25, 2014\nPetitioner Walden, a Georgia police officer working as a deputized Drug\n  Enforcement Administration agent at a Georgia airport, searched re-\n  spondents and seized a large amount of cash. Respondents allege\n  that after they returned to their Nevada residence, petitioner helped\n  draft a false probable cause affidavit in support of the funds\u2019 forfei-\n  ture and forwarded it to a United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia.\n  In the end, no forfeiture complaint was filed, and respondents\u2019 funds\n  were returned. Respondents filed a tort suit against petitioner in\n  Federal District Court in Nevada. The District Court dismissed the\n  suit, finding that the Georgia search and seizure did not establish a\n  basis to exercise personal jurisdiction in Nevada. The Ninth Circuit\n  reversed, holding that the District Court could properly exercise ju-\n  risdiction because petitioner had submitted the false probable cause\n  affidavit with the knowledge that it would affect persons with signifi-\n  cant Nevada connections.\nHeld: The District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over petitioner.\n Pp. 5\u201314.\n    (a) The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause constrains a\n State\u2019s authority to bind a nonresident defendant to a judgment of its\n courts, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.

The\n    plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the fo-\n    rum. These same principles apply when intentional torts are in-\n    volved. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U.

No part of peti-\n    tioner\u2019s course of conduct occurred in Nevada, and he formed no ju-\n    risdictionally relevant contacts with that forum. The Ninth Circuit\n    reached its contrary conclusion by improperly shifting the analytical\n    focus from petitioner\u2019s contacts with the forum to his contacts with\n    respondents, obscuring the reality that none of petitioner\u2019s chal-\n    lenged conduct had anything to do with Nevada itself.

The proper question is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct\n    connects him to the forum in a meaningful way: Here, respondents\u2019\n    claimed injury does not evince such a connection.

Because the defendant had no\nother contacts with Nevada, and because a plaintiff \u2019s con-\ntacts with the forum State cannot be \u201cdecisive in deter-\nmining whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights are\nviolated,\u201d Rush v.

In August 2006, petitioner\nwas working at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport as\na deputized agent of the Drug Enforcement Administra-\ntion (DEA). As part of a task force, petitioner conducted\ninvestigative stops and other law enforcement functions in\nsupport of the DEA\u2019s airport drug interdiction program.\n   On August 8, 2006, Transportation Security Admin-\n2                        WALDEN v.

They found almost $97,000 in\ncash. Fiore explained to DEA agents in San Juan that she\nand Gipson had been gambling at a casino known as the\nEl San Juan, and that they had residences in both Cali-\nfornia and Nevada (though they provided only California\nidentification). After respondents were cleared for depar-\nture, a law enforcement official at the San Juan airport\nnotified petitioner\u2019s task force in Atlanta that respondents\nhad boarded a plane for Atlanta, where they planned to\ncatch a connecting flight to Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   When respondents arrived in Atlanta, petitioner and\nanother DEA agent approached them at the departure\ngate for their flight to Las Vegas. In response to petition-\ner\u2019s questioning, Fiore explained that she and Gipson were\nprofessional gamblers. Respondents maintained that the\ncash they were carrying was their gambling \u201c \u2018bank\u2019 \u201d and\nwinnings. App. 15, 24. After using a drug-sniffing dog to\nperform a sniff test, petitioner seized the cash.1 Petitioner\nadvised respondents that their funds would be returned if\nthey later proved a legitimate source for the cash. Re-\nspondents then boarded their plane.\n   After respondents departed, petitioner moved the cash\nto a secure location and the matter was forwarded to DEA\nheadquarters. The next day, petitioner received a phone\ncall from respondents\u2019 attorney in Nevada seeking return\nof the funds. On two occasions over the next month, peti-\ntioner also received documentation from the attorney\nregarding the legitimacy of the funds.\n   At some point after petitioner seized the cash, he helped\ndraft an affidavit to show probable cause for forfeiture of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Respondents allege that the sniff test was \u201cat best, inconclusive,\u201d\n\nand there is no indication in the pleadings that drugs or drug residue\nwere ever found on or with the cash.

In the end,\nno forfeiture complaint was filed, and the DEA returned\nthe funds to respondents in March 2007.\n   Respondents filed suit against petitioner in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Nevada, seeking\nmoney damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Nar-\ncotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Respondents alleged\nthat petitioner violated their Fourth Amendment rights by\n(1) seizing the cash without probable cause; (2) keeping\nthe money after concluding it did not come from drug-\nrelated activity; (3) drafting and forwarding a probable\ncause affidavit to support a forfeiture action while know-\ning the affidavit contained false statements; (4) willfully\nseeking forfeiture while withholding exculpatory informa-\ntion; and (5) withholding that exculpatory information\nfrom the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\n   The District Court granted petitioner\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Calder v. Jones,\n465 U. S. 783 (1984), the court determined that petition-\ner\u2019s search of respondents and his seizure of the cash in\nGeorgia did not establish a basis to exercise personal\njurisdiction in Nevada. The court concluded that even if\npetitioner caused harm to respondents in Nevada while\nknowing they lived in Nevada, that fact alone did not\nconfer jurisdiction.

The Court of\nAppeals assumed the District Court had correctly deter-\nmined that petitioner\u2019s search and seizure in Georgia\ncould not support exercise of jurisdiction in Nevada.

For a State\nto exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the\ndefendant\u2019s suit-related conduct must create a substantial\nconnection with the forum State. Two related aspects of\nthis necessary relationship are relevant in this case.\n   First, the relationship must arise out of contacts that\nthe \u201cdefendant himself \u201d creates with the forum State.\nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.

We have\nconsistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-\nfocused \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry by demonstrating\ncontacts between the plaintiff (or third parties) and the\nforum State.

We have thus rejected a plain-\ntiff \u2019s argument that a Florida court could exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction over a trustee in Delaware based solely on\nthe contacts of the trust\u2019s settlor, who was domiciled in\nFlorida and had executed powers of appointment there.\nHanson v. Denckla, 357 U. S. 235, 253\u2013254 (1958). We\nhave likewise held that Oklahoma courts could not exer-\ncise personal jurisdiction over an automobile distributor\nthat supplies New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut\ndealers based only on an automobile purchaser\u2019s act of\ndriving it on Oklahoma highways. World-Wide Volks-\nwagen Corp., supra, at 298. Put simply, however sig-\nnificant the plaintiff \u2019s contacts with the forum may be,\nthose contacts cannot be \u201cdecisive in determining whether\nthe defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated.\u201d Rush,\n444 U. S., at 332.\n   Second, our \u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis looks to the\ndefendant\u2019s contacts with the forum State itself, not the\ndefendant\u2019s contacts with persons who reside there. See,\ne.g., International Shoe, supra, at 319 (Due process \u201cdoes\nnot contemplate that a state may make binding a judg-\nment in personam against an individual . . . with which\nthe state has no contacts, ties, or relations\u201d); Hanson,\nsupra, at 251 (\u201cHowever minimal the burden of defending\nin a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon\nto do so unless he has had the \u2018minimal contacts\u2019 with that\nState that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over\nhim\u201d). Accordingly, we have upheld the assertion of juris-\ndiction over defendants who have purposefully \u201creach[ed]\nout beyond\u201d their State and into another by, for example,\nentering a contractual relationship that \u201cenvisioned con-\ntinuing and wide-reaching contacts\u201d in the forum State,\nBurger King, supra, at 479\u2013480, or by circulating maga-\n8                    WALDEN v.

And although physical pres-\nence in the forum is not a prerequisite to jurisdiction,\nBurger King, supra, at 476, physical entry into the State\u2014\neither by the defendant in person or through an agent,\ngoods, mail, or some other means\u2014is certainly a relevant\ncontact. See, e.g., Keeton, supra, at 773\u2013774.\n   But the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the\ndefendant and the forum. Rather, it is the defendant\u2019s\nconduct that must form the necessary connection with the\nforum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him.\nSee Burger King, supra, at 478 (\u201cIf the question is whether\nan individual\u2019s contract with an out-of-state party alone\ncan automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts\nin the other party\u2019s home forum, we believe the answer\nclearly is that it cannot\u201d); Kulko v.

S. 84, 93 (1978)\n(declining to \u201cfind personal jurisdiction in a State . . .\nmerely because [the plaintiff in a child support action] was\nresiding there\u201d). To be sure, a defendant\u2019s contacts with\nthe forum State may be intertwined with his transactions\nor interactions with the plaintiff or other parties. But a\ndefendant\u2019s relationship with a plaintiff or third party,\nstanding alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\nSee Rush, supra, at 332 (\u201cNaturally, the parties\u2019 relation-\nships with each other may be significant in evaluating\ntheir ties to the forum. The requirements of International\nShoe, however, must be met as to each defendant over\nwhom a state court exercises jurisdiction\u201d). Due process\nrequires that a defendant be haled into court in a forum\nState based on his own affiliation with the State, not\nbased on the \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated\u201d contacts\nhe makes by interacting with other persons affiliated with\nthe State.

In that context, it is likewise insufficient to rely\non a defendant\u2019s \u201crandom, fortuitous, or attenuated con-\ntacts\u201d or on the \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of a plaintiff. Ibid.\n(same). A forum State\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over an\nout-of-state intentional tortfeasor must be based on inten-\ntional conduct by the defendant that creates the necessary\ncontacts with the forum.\n   Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S. 783, illustrates the applica-\ntion of these principles. In Calder, a California actress\nbrought a libel suit in California state court against a\nreporter and an editor, both of whom worked for the Na-\ntional Enquirer at its headquarters in Florida. The plain-\ntiff \u2019s libel claims were based on an article written and\nedited by the defendants in Florida for publication in the\nNational Enquirer, a national weekly newspaper with a\nCalifornia circulation of roughly 600,000.\n   We held that California\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over\nthe defendants was consistent with due process. Although\nwe recognized that the defendants\u2019 activities \u201cfocus[ed]\u201d on\nthe plaintiff, our jurisdictional inquiry \u201cfocuse[d] on \u2018the\nrelationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 788 (quoting Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 204).\nSpecifically, we examined the various contacts the defend-\nants had created with California (and not just with the\nplaintiff) by writing the allegedly libelous story.\n   We found those forum contacts to be ample: The defend-\nants relied on phone calls to \u201cCalifornia sources\u201d for the\ninformation in their article; they wrote the story about the\nplaintiff \u2019s activities in California; they caused reputa-\ntional injury in California by writing an allegedly libelous\narticle that was widely circulated in the State; and the\n\u201cbrunt\u201d of that injury was suffered by the plaintiff in that\nState. 465 U. S., at 788\u2013789. \u201cIn sum, California [wa]s\nthe focal point both of the story and of the harm suffered.\u201d\n10                        WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nId., at 789. Jurisdiction over the defendants was \u201cthere-\nfore proper in California based on the \u2018effects\u2019 of their\nFlorida conduct in California.\u201d Ibid.\n   The crux of Calder was that the reputation-based \u201cef-\nfects\u201d of the alleged libel connected the defendants to\nCalifornia, not just to the plaintiff. The strength of that\nconnection was largely a function of the nature of the libel\ntort. However scandalous a newspaper article might be, it\ncan lead to a loss of reputation only if communicated to\n(and read and understood by) third persons. See Restate-\nment (Second) of Torts \u00a7577, Comment b (1976); see also\nibid. (\u201c[R]eputation is the estimation in which one\u2019s char-\nacter is held by his neighbors or associates\u201d). Accordingly,\nthe reputational injury caused by the defendants\u2019 story\nwould not have occurred but for the fact that the defend-\nants wrote an article for publication in California that was\nread by a large number of California citizens. Indeed,\nbecause publication to third persons is a necessary ele-\nment of libel, see id., \u00a7558, the defendants\u2019 intentional tort\nactually occurred in California. Keeton, 465 U. S., at 777\n(\u201cThe tort of libel is generally held to occur wherever the\noffending material is circulated\u201d). In this way, the \u201cef-\nfects\u201d caused by the defendants\u2019 article\u2014i.e., the injury to\nthe plaintiff \u2019s reputation in the estimation of the Califor-\nnia public\u2014connected the defendants\u2019 conduct to Califor-\nnia, not just to a plaintiff who lived there. That connec-\ntion, combined with the various facts that gave the article\na California focus, sufficed to authorize the California\ncourt\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction.7\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 The defendants in Calder argued that no contacts they had with\n\nCalifornia were sufficiently purposeful because their employer was\nresponsible for circulation of the article. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U. S.\n783, 789 (1984). We rejected that argument. Even though the defend-\nants did not circulate the article themselves, they \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d\n\u201ctheir intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions\u201d at California be-\ncause they knew the National Enquirer \u201cha[d] its largest circulation\u201d in\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

S., at 251. It is undisputed that no part of\npetitioner\u2019s course of conduct occurred in Nevada. Peti-\ntioner approached, questioned, and searched respondents,\nand seized the cash at issue, in the Atlanta airport. It is\nalleged that petitioner later helped draft a \u201cfalse probable\ncause affidavit\u201d in Georgia and forwarded that affidavit to\na United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Georgia to support a\npotential action for forfeiture of the seized funds. 688\nF. 3d, at 563. Petitioner never traveled to, conducted\nactivities within, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or\nanyone to Nevada. In short, when viewed through the\nproper lens\u2014whether the defendant\u2019s actions connect him\nto the forum\u2014petitioner formed no jurisdictionally rele-\nvant contacts with Nevada.\n   The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion by\nshifting the analytical focus from petitioner\u2019s contacts with\nthe forum to his contacts with respondents. See Rush, 444\nU. S., at 332. Rather than assessing petitioner\u2019s own\ncontacts with Nevada, the Court of Appeals looked to\npetitioner\u2019s knowledge of respondents\u2019 \u201cstrong forum\nconnections.\u201d 688 F. 3d, at 577\u2013579, 581. In the court\u2019s\nview, that knowledge, combined with its conclusion that\nrespondents suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada, satis-\nfied the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry.8 Id., at 582.\n   This approach to the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d analysis\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nCalifornia, and that the article would \u201chave a potentially devastating\nimpact\u201d there. Id., at 789\u2013790.\n  8 Respondents propose a substantially similar analysis. They suggest\n\nthat \u201ca defendant creates sufficient minimum contacts with a forum\nwhen he (1) intentionally targets (2) a known resident of the forum (3)\nfor imposition of an injury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is\nresiding in the forum state.\u201d Brief for Respondents 26\u201327.\n12                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nimpermissibly allows a plaintiff \u2019s contacts with the de-\nfendant and forum to drive the jurisdictional analysis.\nPetitioner\u2019s actions in Georgia did not create sufficient\ncontacts with Nevada simply because he allegedly directed\nhis conduct at plaintiffs whom he knew had Nevada con-\nnections. Such reasoning improperly attributes a plain-\ntiff \u2019s forum connections to the defendant and makes those\nconnections \u201cdecisive\u201d in the jurisdictional analysis. See\nRush, supra, at 332. It also obscures the reality that none\nof petitioner\u2019s challenged conduct had anything to do with\nNevada itself.\n   Relying on Calder, respondents emphasize that they\nsuffered the \u201cinjury\u201d caused by petitioner\u2019s allegedly tor-\ntious conduct (i.e., the delayed return of their gambling\nfunds) while they were residing in the forum. Brief for\nRespondents 14. This emphasis is likewise misplaced. As\npreviously noted, Calder made clear that mere injury to a\nforum resident is not a sufficient connection to the forum.\nRegardless of where a plaintiff lives or works, an injury is\njurisdictionally relevant only insofar as it shows that the\ndefendant has formed a contact with the forum State. The\nproper question is not where the plaintiff experienced a\nparticular injury or effect but whether the defendant\u2019s\nconduct connects him to the forum in a meaningful way.\n   Respondents\u2019 claimed injury does not evince a connec-\ntion between petitioner and Nevada. Even if we consider\nthe continuation of the seizure in Georgia to be a distinct\ninjury, it is not the sort of effect that is tethered to Nevada\nin any meaningful way. Respondents (and only respond-\nents) lacked access to their funds in Nevada not because\nanything independently occurred there, but because Ne-\nvada is where respondents chose to be at a time when they\ndesired to use the funds seized by petitioner. Respondents\nwould have experienced this same lack of access in Cali-\nfornia, Mississippi, or wherever else they might have\ntraveled and found themselves wanting more money than\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Unlike the broad publication of the forum-\nfocused story in Calder, the effects of petitioner\u2019s con-\nduct on respondents are not connected to the forum State\nin a way that makes those effects a proper basis for\njurisdiction.9\n   The Court of Appeals pointed to other possible contacts\nwith Nevada, each ultimately unavailing. Respondents\u2019\nNevada attorney contacted petitioner in Georgia, but that\nis precisely the sort of \u201cunilateral activity\u201d of a third party\nthat \u201ccannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the\nforum State.\u201d Hanson, 357 U. S., at 253. Respondents\nallege that some of the cash seized in Georgia \u201coriginated\u201d\nin Nevada, but that attenuated connection was not created\nby petitioner, and the cash was in Georgia, not Nevada,\nwhen petitioner seized it. Finally, the funds were eventu-\nally returned to respondents in Nevada, but petitioner had\nnothing to do with that return (indeed, it seems likely that\nit was respondents\u2019 unilateral decision to have their funds\nsent to Nevada).\n                       *    *     *\n  Well-established principles of personal jurisdiction are\nsufficient to decide this case. The proper focus of the\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Respondents    warn that if we decide petitioner lacks minimum con-\ntacts in this case, it will bring about unfairness in cases where inten-\ntional torts are committed via the Internet or other electronic means\n(e.g., fraudulent access of financial accounts or \u201cphishing\u201d schemes). As\nan initial matter, we reiterate that the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry\nprincipally protects the liberty of the nonresident defendant, not the\ninterests of the plaintiff. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n444 U. S., 286, 291\u2013292 (1980). In any event, this case does not present\nthe very different questions whether and how a defendant\u2019s virtual\n\u201cpresence\u201d and conduct translate into \u201ccontacts\u201d with a particular\nState. To the contrary, there is no question where the conduct giving\nrise to this litigation took place: Petitioner seized physical cash from\nrespondents in the Atlanta airport, and he later drafted and forwarded\nan affidavit in Georgia. We leave questions about virtual contacts for\nanother day.\n14                    WALDEN v. FIORE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d inquiry in intentional-tort cases is\n\u201c \u2018the relationship among the defendant, the forum, and\nthe litigation.\u2019 \u201d Calder, 465 U. S., at 788. And it is the\ndefendant, not the plaintiff or third parties, who must\ncreate contacts with the forum State. In this case, the\napplication of those principles is clear: Petitioner\u2019s rele-\nvant conduct occurred entirely in Georgia, and the mere\nfact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections\nto the forum State does not suffice to authorize jurisdic-\ntion.
