APEL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12\u20131038. Argued December 4, 2013\u2014Decided February 26, 2014\nVandenberg Air Force Base has been designated a \u201cclosed base,\u201d mean-\n  ing that civilians may not enter without express permission. The Air\n  Force has granted an easement over two areas of the Base, with the\n  result that two public highways traverse the Base. Adjacent to one of\n  those highways is an area that the Government has designated for\n  peaceful protests. The Base commander has enacted several re-\n  strictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stat-\n  ing that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may\n  be barred from entering the Base.\n    Petitioner Apel was barred from the Base for trespassing and van-\n  dalism, but continued to enter the protest area. A Magistrate Judge\n  convicted him of violating 18 U. S. C. \u00a71382, which makes it a crime\n  to reenter a \u201cmilitary. . . installation\u201d after having been ordered not\n  to do so \u201cby any officer or person in command.\u201d On appeal, the Fed-\n  eral District Court rejected Apel\u2019s defense that \u00a71382 does not apply\n  to the designated protest area. The Ninth Circuit reversed. It held\n  that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Gov-\n  ernment of exclusive possession, \u00a71382 did not cover the portion of\n  the Base where Apel\u2019s protest occurred.\nHeld: A \u201cmilitary. . . installation\u201d for purposes of \u00a71382 encompasses\n the commanding officer\u2019s area of responsibility, and it includes Van-\n denberg\u2019s highways and protest area. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) Contrary to Apel\u2019s argument, \u00a71382 does not require exclusive\n possession and control. The statute is written broadly to apply to\n many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text de-\n fines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the\n nature of the Government\u2019s possessory interest. See United States v.\n Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 682. Nor have military places been defined\n2                       UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    historically as land withdrawn from public use. The common feature\n    of the places described in \u00a71382 is that they have defined boundaries\n    and are subject to the command authority of a military officer. This\n    conclusion is confirmed by United States v. Phisterer, 94 U. S. 219,\n    222, which defined the term \u201cmilitary station\u201d as a place \u201cwhere mili-\n    tary duty is performed or military protection afforded.\u201d And while\n    some Executive Branch documents have said that \u00a71382 requires ex-\n    clusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has\n    never held that the Government\u2019s reading of a criminal statute is en-\n    titled to any deference. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Section 1382 applies to any place with a defined boundary that\n    is under the command of a military officer. Apel contends that the\n    highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie out-\n    side fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclu-\n    sion. The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property\n    under the administration of the Air Force. The Air Force\u2019s choice to\n    secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries\n    or diminish its commander\u2019s jurisdiction. Apel\u2019s further contention\n    that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where\n    military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The\n    Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests\n    in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred\n    from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District\n    Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over\n    the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander\n    the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and\n    reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the\n    Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public\n    for security purposes or when conducting a military launch. In any\n    event, \u00a71382 does not require base commanders to make continuous,\n    uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose\n    authority to exclude certain individuals. Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule\n    would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise diffi-\n    cult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening\n    portions of their bases for public convenience. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) Apel\u2019s argument that the statute was unconstitutional as ap-\n    plied was not reached by the Ninth Circuit and, thus, is not ad-\n    dressed here.

The\nquestion presented is whether a portion of an Air Force\nbase that contains a designated protest area and an ease-\nment for a public road qualifies as part of a \u201cmilitary\ninstallation.\u201d\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Vandenberg Air Force Base is located in central Califor-\nnia, near the coast, approximately 170 miles northwest of\nLos Angeles. The Base sits on land owned by the United\nStates and administered by the Department of the Air\nForce. It is the site of sensitive missile and space launch\nfacilities. The commander of Vandenberg has designated\nit a \u201cclosed base,\u201d meaning that civilians may not enter\nwithout express permission. Memorandum for the Gen-\neral Public Re: Closed Base, from David J. Buck, Com-\nmander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 51; see also 32 CFR\n2                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7809a.2(b) (2013) (\u201cEach [Air Force] commander is au-\nthorized to grant or deny access to their installations,\nand to exclude or remove persons whose presence is\nunauthorized\u201d).\n   Although the Base is closed, the Air Force has granted\nto the County of Santa Barbara \u201can easement for a right-\nof-way for a road or street\u201d over two areas within Vanden-\nberg.

Highway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) runs\nthrough the eastern part of the Base and provides a route\nbetween the towns of Santa Maria and Lompoc. Highway\n246 runs through the southern part of the Base and allows\naccess to a beach and a train station on Vandenberg\u2019s\nwestern edge. The State of California maintains and po-\nlices these highways as it does other state roads, except\nthat its jurisdiction is merely \u201cconcurrent\u201d with that of\nthe Federal Government. Letter from Governor Edmund G.\nBrown, Jr., to Joseph C. Zengerle, Assistant Secretary of\nthe Air Force (July 21, 1981), App. 40. The easement in-\nstrument states that use of the roads \u201cshall be subject to\nsuch rules and regulations as [the Base commander] may\nprescribe from time to time in order to properly protect the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d Easement, App. 36.

There Highway 1 intersects with\nLompoc Casmalia Road, which continues running north-\nwest, and with California Boulevard, which runs south-\nwest.

Those\nareas are surrounded by a fence and entered by a security\ncheckpoint. See Appendix, infra (maps from record).\n   In the south corner of the intersection is an area that\nhas been designated by the Federal Government for peace-\nful protests. A painted green line on the pavement, a\ntemporary fence, Highway 1, and Lompoc Casmalia Road\nmark the boundaries of the protest area. Memorandum\nfor the General Public Re: Limited Permission for Peaceful\nProtest Activity Policy, from David J. Buck, Commander\n(Oct. 23, 2008), App. 57\u201358. The Base commander has\nenacted several restrictions to control the protest area,\nincluding reserving the authority \u201cfor any reason\u201d to with-\ndraw permission to protest and \u201cretain[ing] authority and\ncontrol over who may access the installation, including\naccess to roadway easements for purposes other than\ntraversing by vehicle through the installation.\u201d Ibid. A\npublic advisory explains other rules for the protest area:\ndemonstrations \u201cmust be coordinated and scheduled with\n[B]ase Public Affairs and [Base] Security Forces at least\ntwo (2) weeks in advance\u201d; \u201c[a]nyone failing to vacate\ninstallation property upon advisement from Security\nForces will be cited for trespass pursuant to [18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71382]\u201d; and \u201c[a]ctivities other than peaceful protests in\nthis area are not permitted and are specifically prohib-\nited.\u201d U. S. Air Force Fact Sheet, Protest Advisory, App.\n52\u201353.\n   The advisory states, consistent with federal regulations,\nthat anyone who fails to adhere to these policies may\n\u201creceive an official letter barring you from entering Van-\ndenberg.\u201d Id., at 55; see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.5 (\u201cUnder the\nauthority of 50 U.

And for any person who is \u201ccurrently\nbarred from Vandenberg AFB, there is no exception to the\n4                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbarment permitting you to attend peaceful protest activity\non Vandenberg AFB property. If you are barred and\nattend a protest or are otherwise found on base, you will\nbe cited and detained for a trespass violation due to the\nnon-adherence of the barment order.\u201d Protest Advisory,\nApp. 54.\n                              B\n    John Dennis Apel is an antiwar activist who demon-\nstrates at Vandenberg. In March 2003, Apel trespassed\nbeyond the designated protest area and threw blood on a\nsign for the Base. He was convicted for these actions, was\nsentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment, and was barred\nfrom the Base for three years. In May 2007, Apel returned\nto Vandenberg to protest. When he trespassed again and\nwas convicted, he received another order barring him from\nVandenberg, this time permanently, unless he followed\nspecified procedures \u201cto modify or revoke\u201d the order.\nMemorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order (Oct.\n22, 2007), App. 63\u201365. The only exception to the barment\nwas limited permission from the Base commander for Apel\nto \u201c \u2018traverse\u2019, meaning to travel . . . on [Highway] 1 and\n. . . on [Highway] 246 . . . . You are not authorized to\ndeviate from these paved roadways onto [Vandenberg]\nproperty.\u201d Id., at 64. The order informed Apel that if\nhe reentered Vandenberg in violation of the order, he\nwould \u201cbe subject to detention by Security Forces personnel\nand prosecution by civilian authorities for a violation of\n[18 U. S. C. \u00a71382].\u201d Ibid.\n    Apel ignored the commander\u2019s order and reentered\nVandenberg several times during 2008 and 2009. That led\nthe Base commander to serve Apel with an updated order,\nwhich informed him:\n    \u201cYou continue to refuse to adhere to the rules and\n    guidelines that have been put in place by me to pro-\n    tect and preserve order and to safeguard the persons\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. \u00a7 797 and 32\n    C. F. R. \u00a7 809a.0\u2013[809]a.11. You cannot be expected\n    or trusted to abide by the protest guidance rules based\n    upon this behavior. I consider your presence on this\n    installation to be a risk and detrimental to my re-\n    sponsibility to protect and preserve order and to safe-\n    guard the persons and property under my jurisdiction.\n    You are again ordered not to enter onto [Vandenberg]\n    property, as provided in the October 22, 2007 order.\n    The content and basis of that order is hereby incorpo-\n    rated by reference herein, EXCEPT that your barment\n    will be for a period of three (3) years from the date\n    of this supplemental letter.\u201d Memorandum for John D.\n    Apel Re: Barment Order Dated Oct. 22, 2007 (served\n    Jan. 31, 2010), App. 59\u201362.\n  Apel ignored this barment order too, and on three occa-\nsions in 2010 he reentered Vandenberg to protest in the\ndesignated area. Each time Vandenberg security person-\nnel reminded him of the barment order and instructed him\nto leave. Each time Apel refused. He was cited for violat-\ning \u00a71382 and escorted off Base property.\n  A Magistrate Judge convicted Apel and ordered him to\npay a total of $355 in fines and fees. Apel appealed to the\nFederal District Court for the Central District of Califor-\nnia. The District Court rejected Apel\u2019s defense that \u00a71382\ndoes not apply to the designated protest area, holding that\nthe military \u201chas a sufficient possessory interest and\nexercises sufficient control over\u201d the area. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 14a. The court also concluded that Apel\u2019s conviction\nwould not violate the First Amendment. Id., at 13a.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed, holding that the statute does not apply.\nBased on Circuit precedent, the Ninth Circuit interpreted\n6                    UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71382 to require the Government to prove that it has \u201cthe\nexclusive right of possession of the area on which the\ntrespass allegedly occurred.\u201d 676 F. 3d 1202, 1203 (2012)\n(citing United States v. Parker, 651 F. 3d 1180 (CA9\n2011)). The court found that the easement through Van-\ndenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession\nof the roadway, so it concluded that \u00a71382 does not cover\nthe portion of the Base where Apel\u2019s protest occurred.\n   We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\nvacate the judgment.\n                               II\n    Section 1382 provides in full:\n         \u201cWhoever, within the jurisdiction of the United\n      States, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard\n      reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or instal-\n      lation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful\n      regulation; or\n         \u201cWhoever reenters or is found within any such res-\n      ervation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installa-\n      tion, after having been removed therefrom or ordered\n      not to reenter by any officer or person in command or\n      charge thereof\u2014\n         \u201cShall be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n      more than six months, or both.\u201d\n   Apel does not dispute that he was \u201cfound within\u201d the\nlawful boundaries of Vandenberg, \u201cwithin the jurisdiction\nof the United States,\u201d after having been \u201cordered not to\nreenter\u201d by the Base commander. \u00a71382. And certainly\nVandenberg would naturally be described as a \u201cmilitary\ninstallation\u201d: it is an Air Force base, which a military\ncommander has closed to the public (with limited excep-\ntions), located on land owned by the United States and\nunder the jurisdiction of the Air Force, where military\npersonnel conduct sensitive missile operations.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Against this straightforward interpretation, Apel insists\nthat \u00a71382 applies only where the military exercises exclu-\nsive possession and control, which, he contends, does not\ninclude land subject to a roadway easement. Apel further\nargues that the fence enclosing Vandenberg\u2019s operational\nfacilities marks the real boundary of the Base and that\nVandenberg\u2019s commander lacks authority to control the\nrest, or at least the designated protest area. We take his\narguments in turn.\n                              A\n   Apel asserts that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s exclusive posses-\nsion and control requirement \u201cderives directly from the\ntext of \u00a71382.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. It does not.\nSection 1382 is written broadly to apply to many different\nkinds of military places: a \u201creservation, post, fort, arsenal,\nyard, station, or installation.\u201d Nothing in the text defines\nthose places in terms of the access granted to the public or\nthe nature of the Government\u2019s possessory interest. See\nUnited States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 682 (1985) (\u201cThe\nlanguage of the statute does not limit \u00a71382 to military\nbases where access is restricted\u201d).\n   Apel contends that the listed military places have histor-\nically been defined as land withdrawn from public use.\nNot so. Historical sources are replete with references to\nmilitary \u201cforts\u201d and \u201cposts\u201d that provided services to civil-\nians, and were open for access by them. See, e.g., R.\nWooster, Soldiers, Sutlers, and Settlers 64 (1987) (\u201cThe\nfrontier forts of Texas were not simply army bases occu-\npied solely by military personnel. They were often bus-\ntling communities that attracted merchants, laborers,\nsettlers, and dependents\u201d); Davis, The Sutler at Fort\nBridger, 2 Western Hist. Q. 37, 37, 40\u201341 (Jan. 1971)\n(describing a 19th-century post in southwestern present\nWyoming which included a \u201csutler,\u201d a civilian merchant\nwho set up shop inside the fort and sold wares both to\n8                  UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsoldiers and to civilians from outside the base).\n   The common feature of the places described in \u00a71382 is\nnot that they are used exclusively by the military, but that\nthey have defined boundaries and are subject to the com-\nmand authority of a military officer. That makes sense,\nbecause the Solicitor General has informed us that a\nmilitary commander\u2019s authority is frequently defined by\nthe boundaries of a particular place: When the Depart-\nment of Defense establishes a base, military commanders\nassign a military unit to the base, and the commanding\nofficer of the unit becomes the commander of the base. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 6\u20137.\n   Apel responds by invoking our decision in United States\nv. Phisterer, 94 U. S. 219 (1877), which held that the term\n\u201cmilitary station\u201d (in a different statute) did not include\na soldier\u2019s off-base home. But Phisterer only confirms\nour conclusion that \u00a71382 does not require exclusive use,\npossession, or control. For there we interpreted \u201cmilitary\nstation\u201d to mean \u201ca place where troops are assembled,\nwhere military stores, animate or inanimate, are kept or\ndistributed, where military duty is performed or military\nprotection afforded,\u2014where something, in short, more or\nless closely connected with arms or war is kept or is to be\ndone.\u201d Id., at 222. To describe a place as \u201cmore or less\nclosely connected\u201d with military activities hardly requires\nthat the military hold an exclusive right to the property.\nRather, \u201cmilitary duty\u201d and \u201cmilitary protection\u201d are\nsynonymous with the exercise of military jurisdiction.\nAnd that, not coincidentally, is precisely how the term\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d is used elsewhere in federal law.\nSee, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a72687(g)(1) (defining \u201cmilitary instal-\nlation\u201d as a \u201cbase . . . or other activity under the jurisdic-\ntion of the Department of Defense\u201d); \u00a72801(c)(4) (defining\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d as a \u201cbase . . . or other activity\nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military de-\npartment\u201d); 32 CFR \u00a7809a.0 (\u201cThis part prescribes the\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Brief\nfor Respondent 44\u201347. So they have, and that is a point in\nhis favor. But those opinions are not intended to be bind-\ning. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019 Man-\nual \u00a71\u20131.100 (2009) (\u201cThe Manual provides only internal\nDepartment of Justice guidance. It is not intended to,\ndoes not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights,\nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party\nin any matter civil or criminal\u201d); 2 Civil Law Opinions\nof The Judge Advocate General, United States Air Force\n1978\u20131983 (Preface) (opinions of the Judge Advocate Gen-\neral \u201care good starting points but should not be cited\nas precedence [sic] without first verifying the validity of\nthe conclusions by independent research\u201d). Their views\nmay reflect overly cautious legal advice based on division\nin the lower courts. Or they may reflect legal error. Ei-\nther way, we have never held that the Government\u2019s\nreading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.\nSee Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 177 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Today, as throughout our Nation\u2019s history, there is sig-\nnificant variation in the ownership status of U. S. mil-\nitary sites around the world. Some are owned in fee,\nothers are leased. Some are routinely open to the public,\nothers are open for specific occasions or purposes, and no\npublic access whatsoever is permitted on others. Many,\nincluding such well-known places as the Washington Navy\nYard and the United States Air Force Academy, have\nroads running through them that are used freely by the\npublic. Nothing in \u00a71382 or our history suggests that the\n10                UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not apply to a military base under the com-\nmand of the Air Force, merely because the Government\nhas conveyed a limited right to travel through a portion of\nthe base or to assemble in a particular area.\n                              B\n   Section 1382 is most naturally read to apply to places\nwith a defined boundary under the command of a military\nofficer. Apel argues, however, that Vandenberg\u2019s com-\nmander has no authority on the highways running\nthrough the Base or, apparently, in the designated protest\narea. His arguments more or less reduce to two conten-\ntions: that the highways and protest area lie \u201coutside the\nentrance to [a] closed military installation[],\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 22, and that they are \u201cuncontrolled\u201d spaces\nwhere \u201cno military operations are performed,\u201d id., at 23.\nNeither contention is sound.\n   First, to say that the highway and protest area are\n\u201coutside\u201d the Vandenberg installation is not a legal ar-\ngument; it simply assumes the conclusion. Perhaps recog-\nnizing as much, Apel tacks: He suggests that because\nVandenberg\u2019s operational facilities are surrounded by a fence\nand guarded by a security checkpoint, the Government\nhas determined that it does not control the rest of the\nBase. The problem with this argument is that the United\nStates has placed the entire Vandenberg property under\nthe administration of the Air Force, which has defined\nthat property as an Air Force base and designated the\nBase commander to exercise jurisdiction. Federal law\nmakes the commander responsible \u201cfor the protection or\nsecurity of \u201d \u201cproperty subject to the jurisdiction, admin-\nistration, or in the custody of the Department of Defense.\u201d\n50 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7797(a)(2), (4); see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.2(a)\n(\u201cAir Force installation commanders are responsible for\nprotecting personnel and property under their jurisdic-\ntion\u201d). And pursuant to that authority, the Base com-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmander has issued an order closing the entire base to the\npublic. Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51; see\nalso 32 CFR \u00a7809a.3 (\u201cany directive issued by the com-\nmander of a military installation or facility, which in-\ncludes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from\na military installation, is legally enforceable against all\npersons\u201d). The fact that the Air Force chooses to secure\na portion of the Base more closely\u2014be it with a fence, a\ncheckpoint, or a painted green line\u2014does not alter the\nboundaries of the Base or diminish the jurisdiction of the\nmilitary commander.\n  As for Apel\u2019s claim that the protest area specifically is\nuncontrolled, the record is conclusively to the contrary.\nThe Base commander \u201cat all times has retained authority\nand control over who may access the installation,\u201d includ-\ning the protest area. Buck Memorandum Re: Protest\nActivity, App. 58. He has enacted rules to restrict the\nmanner of protests in the designated area. Protest Advi-\nsory, App. 53. In particular, he requires two weeks\u2019 notice\nto schedule a protest and prohibits the distribution of\npamphlets or leaflets. Id., at 52\u201353. The Base com-\nmander has also publicly stated that persons who are\nbarred from Vandenberg\u2014for whatever reason\u2014may not\ncome onto the Base to protest. Id., at 54. And the District\nCourt found, after hearing testimony, that \u201cthe Govern-\nment exercises substantial control over the designated\nprotest area, including, for example, patrolling the area.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 14a\u201315a. Apel has never disputed\nthese facts.\n  Instead Apel tells us that, by granting an easement, the\nmilitary has \u201crelinquished its right to exclude civilians\nfrom Highway 1,\u201d Brief for Respondent 36, and that the\neasement does not \u201cpermit[ ]\u201d use by the military, id., at\n43. But the easement itself specifically reserves to Van-\ndenberg\u2019s commander the authority to restrict access to\nthe entire Base, including Highway 1, when necessary \u201cto\n12                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproperly protect the interests of the United States,\u201d and\nlikewise \u201creserves to [the United States] rights-of-way for\nall purposes.\u201d Easement, App. 36. We simply do not\nunderstand how Apel can claim that \u201c[n]othing in the\neasement contemplates, or even permits, military use or\noccupation; it provides for exclusive civil use and occupa-\ntion.\u201d Brief for Respondent 43. Moreover, the Base com-\nmander, in an exercise of his command authority, has\nnotified the public that use of the roads is \u201climited to . . .\nvehicular travel activity through the base,\u201d which does not\ninclude Apel\u2019s protest activity. See Buck Memorandum\nRe: Closed Base, App. 51.\n   Apel likewise offers no support for his contention that\nmilitary functions do not occur on the easement highways.\nThe Government has referred us to instances when the\ncommander of Vandenberg has closed the highways to the\npublic for security purposes or when conducting a military\nlaunch. Reply Brief 12, and n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139. In\nany event, there is no indication that Congress intended\n\u00a71382 to require base commanders to make continuous,\nuninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest\nthey lose authority to exclude individuals who have van-\ndalized military property and been determined to pose a\nthreat to the order and security of the base.\n   In sum, we decline Apel\u2019s invitation to require civilian\njudges to examine U. S. military sites around the world,\nparcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which\nhave fences, and which have a sufficiently important,\npersistent military purpose. The use-it-or-lose-it rule that\nApel proposes would frustrate the administration of mili-\ntary facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who\nare not expert in military operations. And it would dis-\ncourage commanders from opening portions of their bases\nfor the convenience of the public. We think a much better\nreading of \u00a71382 is that it reaches all property within the\ndefined boundaries of a military place that is under the\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

But the Court of Appeals never reached Apel\u2019s\nconstitutional arguments, and we decline to do so in the\nfirst instance. Apel also attempts to repackage his First\nAmendment objections as a statutory interpretation ar-\ngument based on constitutional avoidance. See Brief for\nRespondent 54 (\u201cthe statute should be interpreted . . . not\nto apply to peaceful protests on a public road outside of a\nclosed military base over which an easement has been\ngranted and that has been declared a protest zone\u201d). But\nwe do not \u201cinterpret\u201d statutes by gerrymandering them\nwith a list of exceptions that happen to describe a party\u2019s\ncase. \u201cThe canon [of constitutional avoidance] is not a\nmethod of adjudicating constitutional questions by other\nmeans.\u201d Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\nWhether \u00a71382 is unconstitutional as applied is a question\nwe need not address.\n                        *     *    *\n  Where a place with a defined boundary is under the\nadministration of a military department, the limits of the\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d for purposes of \u00a71382 are cotermi-\nnous with the commanding officer\u2019s area of responsibility.\nThose limits do not change when the commander invites\nthe public to use a portion of the base for a road, a school,\na bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the com-\nmander reserves authority to protect military property by,\namong other things, excluding vandals and trespassers.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                    APPENDIX\nSanta Maria-Highway 1 Gate to Vandenberg Air Force Base\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

APEL\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n No. 12\u20131038. Argued December 4, 2013\u2014Decided February 26, 2014\nVandenberg Air Force Base has been designated a \u201cclosed base,\u201d mean-\n  ing that civilians may not enter without express permission. The Air\n  Force has granted an easement over two areas of the Base, with the\n  result that two public highways traverse the Base. Adjacent to one of\n  those highways is an area that the Government has designated for\n  peaceful protests. The Base commander has enacted several re-\n  strictions to control the protest area and has issued an advisory stat-\n  ing that anyone who fails to adhere to the protest area policies may\n  be barred from entering the Base.\n    Petitioner Apel was barred from the Base for trespassing and van-\n  dalism, but continued to enter the protest area. A Magistrate Judge\n  convicted him of violating 18 U. S. C. \u00a71382, which makes it a crime\n  to reenter a \u201cmilitary. . . installation\u201d after having been ordered not\n  to do so \u201cby any officer or person in command.\u201d On appeal, the Fed-\n  eral District Court rejected Apel\u2019s defense that \u00a71382 does not apply\n  to the designated protest area. The Ninth Circuit reversed. It held\n  that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Gov-\n  ernment of exclusive possession, \u00a71382 did not cover the portion of\n  the Base where Apel\u2019s protest occurred.\nHeld: A \u201cmilitary. . . installation\u201d for purposes of \u00a71382 encompasses\n the commanding officer\u2019s area of responsibility, and it includes Van-\n denberg\u2019s highways and protest area. Pp. 6\u201314.\n    (a) Contrary to Apel\u2019s argument, \u00a71382 does not require exclusive\n possession and control. The statute is written broadly to apply to\n many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text de-\n fines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the\n nature of the Government\u2019s possessory interest. See United States v.\n Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 682. Nor have military places been defined\n2                       UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    historically as land withdrawn from public use. The common feature\n    of the places described in \u00a71382 is that they have defined boundaries\n    and are subject to the command authority of a military officer. This\n    conclusion is confirmed by United States v. Phisterer, 94 U. S. 219,\n    222, which defined the term \u201cmilitary station\u201d as a place \u201cwhere mili-\n    tary duty is performed or military protection afforded.\u201d And while\n    some Executive Branch documents have said that \u00a71382 requires ex-\n    clusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has\n    never held that the Government\u2019s reading of a criminal statute is en-\n    titled to any deference. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (b) Section 1382 applies to any place with a defined boundary that\n    is under the command of a military officer. Apel contends that the\n    highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie out-\n    side fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclu-\n    sion. The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property\n    under the administration of the Air Force. The Air Force\u2019s choice to\n    secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries\n    or diminish its commander\u2019s jurisdiction. Apel\u2019s further contention\n    that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where\n    military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The\n    Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests\n    in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred\n    from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District\n    Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over\n    the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander\n    the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and\n    reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the\n    Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public\n    for security purposes or when conducting a military launch. In any\n    event, \u00a71382 does not require base commanders to make continuous,\n    uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose\n    authority to exclude certain individuals. Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule\n    would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise diffi-\n    cult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening\n    portions of their bases for public convenience. Pp. 10\u201313.\n       (c) Apel\u2019s argument that the statute was unconstitutional as ap-\n    plied was not reached by the Ninth Circuit and, thus, is not ad-\n    dressed here.

The\nquestion presented is whether a portion of an Air Force\nbase that contains a designated protest area and an ease-\nment for a public road qualifies as part of a \u201cmilitary\ninstallation.\u201d\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n   Vandenberg Air Force Base is located in central Califor-\nnia, near the coast, approximately 170 miles northwest of\nLos Angeles. The Base sits on land owned by the United\nStates and administered by the Department of the Air\nForce. It is the site of sensitive missile and space launch\nfacilities. The commander of Vandenberg has designated\nit a \u201cclosed base,\u201d meaning that civilians may not enter\nwithout express permission. Memorandum for the Gen-\neral Public Re: Closed Base, from David J. Buck, Com-\nmander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 51; see also 32 CFR\n2                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a7809a.2(b) (2013) (\u201cEach [Air Force] commander is au-\nthorized to grant or deny access to their installations,\nand to exclude or remove persons whose presence is\nunauthorized\u201d).\n   Although the Base is closed, the Air Force has granted\nto the County of Santa Barbara \u201can easement for a right-\nof-way for a road or street\u201d over two areas within Vanden-\nberg. Department of the Air Force, Easement for Road or\nStreet No. DA\u201304\u2013353\u2013ENG\u20138284 (Aug. 20, 1962), App.\n35. Pursuant to that easement, two state roads traverse\nthe Base. Highway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) runs\nthrough the eastern part of the Base and provides a route\nbetween the towns of Santa Maria and Lompoc. Highway\n246 runs through the southern part of the Base and allows\naccess to a beach and a train station on Vandenberg\u2019s\nwestern edge. The State of California maintains and po-\nlices these highways as it does other state roads, except\nthat its jurisdiction is merely \u201cconcurrent\u201d with that of\nthe Federal Government. Letter from Governor Edmund G.\nBrown, Jr., to Joseph C. Zengerle, Assistant Secretary of\nthe Air Force (July 21, 1981), App. 40. The easement in-\nstrument states that use of the roads \u201cshall be subject to\nsuch rules and regulations as [the Base commander] may\nprescribe from time to time in order to properly protect the\ninterests of the United States.\u201d Easement, App. 36. The\nUnited States also \u201creserves to itself rights-of-way for all\npurposes\u201d that would not create \u201cunnecessary interference\nwith . . . highway purposes.\u201d Id., at 37.\n   As relevant to this case, Highway 1 runs northwest\nseveral miles inside Vandenberg until it turns northeast\nat a 90 degree angle. There Highway 1 intersects with\nLompoc Casmalia Road, which continues running north-\nwest, and with California Boulevard, which runs south-\nwest. In the east corner of this intersection there is a\nmiddle school. In the west corner there is a visitors\u2019 center\nand a public bus stop. A short way down California\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nBoulevard is the main entrance to the operational areas of\nthe Base where military personnel live and work. Those\nareas are surrounded by a fence and entered by a security\ncheckpoint. See Appendix, infra (maps from record).\n   In the south corner of the intersection is an area that\nhas been designated by the Federal Government for peace-\nful protests. A painted green line on the pavement, a\ntemporary fence, Highway 1, and Lompoc Casmalia Road\nmark the boundaries of the protest area. Memorandum\nfor the General Public Re: Limited Permission for Peaceful\nProtest Activity Policy, from David J. Buck, Commander\n(Oct. 23, 2008), App. 57\u201358. The Base commander has\nenacted several restrictions to control the protest area,\nincluding reserving the authority \u201cfor any reason\u201d to with-\ndraw permission to protest and \u201cretain[ing] authority and\ncontrol over who may access the installation, including\naccess to roadway easements for purposes other than\ntraversing by vehicle through the installation.\u201d Ibid. A\npublic advisory explains other rules for the protest area:\ndemonstrations \u201cmust be coordinated and scheduled with\n[B]ase Public Affairs and [Base] Security Forces at least\ntwo (2) weeks in advance\u201d; \u201c[a]nyone failing to vacate\ninstallation property upon advisement from Security\nForces will be cited for trespass pursuant to [18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71382]\u201d; and \u201c[a]ctivities other than peaceful protests in\nthis area are not permitted and are specifically prohib-\nited.\u201d U. S. Air Force Fact Sheet, Protest Advisory, App.\n52\u201353.\n   The advisory states, consistent with federal regulations,\nthat anyone who fails to adhere to these policies may\n\u201creceive an official letter barring you from entering Van-\ndenberg.\u201d Id., at 55; see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.5 (\u201cUnder the\nauthority of 50 U. S. C. [\u00a7]797, installation commanders\nmay deny access to the installation through the use of a\nbarment order\u201d). And for any person who is \u201ccurrently\nbarred from Vandenberg AFB, there is no exception to the\n4                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nbarment permitting you to attend peaceful protest activity\non Vandenberg AFB property. If you are barred and\nattend a protest or are otherwise found on base, you will\nbe cited and detained for a trespass violation due to the\nnon-adherence of the barment order.\u201d Protest Advisory,\nApp. 54.\n                              B\n    John Dennis Apel is an antiwar activist who demon-\nstrates at Vandenberg. In March 2003, Apel trespassed\nbeyond the designated protest area and threw blood on a\nsign for the Base. He was convicted for these actions, was\nsentenced to two months\u2019 imprisonment, and was barred\nfrom the Base for three years. In May 2007, Apel returned\nto Vandenberg to protest. When he trespassed again and\nwas convicted, he received another order barring him from\nVandenberg, this time permanently, unless he followed\nspecified procedures \u201cto modify or revoke\u201d the order.\nMemorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order (Oct.\n22, 2007), App. 63\u201365. The only exception to the barment\nwas limited permission from the Base commander for Apel\nto \u201c \u2018traverse\u2019, meaning to travel . . . on [Highway] 1 and\n. . . on [Highway] 246 . . . . You are not authorized to\ndeviate from these paved roadways onto [Vandenberg]\nproperty.\u201d Id., at 64. The order informed Apel that if\nhe reentered Vandenberg in violation of the order, he\nwould \u201cbe subject to detention by Security Forces personnel\nand prosecution by civilian authorities for a violation of\n[18 U. S. C. \u00a71382].\u201d Ibid.\n    Apel ignored the commander\u2019s order and reentered\nVandenberg several times during 2008 and 2009. That led\nthe Base commander to serve Apel with an updated order,\nwhich informed him:\n    \u201cYou continue to refuse to adhere to the rules and\n    guidelines that have been put in place by me to pro-\n    tect and preserve order and to safeguard the persons\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. \u00a7 797 and 32\n    C. F. R. \u00a7 809a.0\u2013[809]a.11. You cannot be expected\n    or trusted to abide by the protest guidance rules based\n    upon this behavior. I consider your presence on this\n    installation to be a risk and detrimental to my re-\n    sponsibility to protect and preserve order and to safe-\n    guard the persons and property under my jurisdiction.\n    You are again ordered not to enter onto [Vandenberg]\n    property, as provided in the October 22, 2007 order.\n    The content and basis of that order is hereby incorpo-\n    rated by reference herein, EXCEPT that your barment\n    will be for a period of three (3) years from the date\n    of this supplemental letter.\u201d Memorandum for John D.\n    Apel Re: Barment Order Dated Oct. 22, 2007 (served\n    Jan. 31, 2010), App. 59\u201362.\n  Apel ignored this barment order too, and on three occa-\nsions in 2010 he reentered Vandenberg to protest in the\ndesignated area. Each time Vandenberg security person-\nnel reminded him of the barment order and instructed him\nto leave. Each time Apel refused. He was cited for violat-\ning \u00a71382 and escorted off Base property.\n  A Magistrate Judge convicted Apel and ordered him to\npay a total of $355 in fines and fees. Apel appealed to the\nFederal District Court for the Central District of Califor-\nnia. The District Court rejected Apel\u2019s defense that \u00a71382\ndoes not apply to the designated protest area, holding that\nthe military \u201chas a sufficient possessory interest and\nexercises sufficient control over\u201d the area. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 14a. The court also concluded that Apel\u2019s conviction\nwould not violate the First Amendment. Id., at 13a.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-\ncuit reversed, holding that the statute does not apply.\nBased on Circuit precedent, the Ninth Circuit interpreted\n6                    UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n\u00a71382 to require the Government to prove that it has \u201cthe\nexclusive right of possession of the area on which the\ntrespass allegedly occurred.\u201d 676 F. 3d 1202, 1203 (2012)\n(citing United States v. Parker, 651 F. 3d 1180 (CA9\n2011)). The court found that the easement through Van-\ndenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession\nof the roadway, so it concluded that \u00a71382 does not cover\nthe portion of the Base where Apel\u2019s protest occurred.\n   We granted certiorari, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), and now\nvacate the judgment.\n                               II\n    Section 1382 provides in full:\n         \u201cWhoever, within the jurisdiction of the United\n      States, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard\n      reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or instal-\n      lation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful\n      regulation; or\n         \u201cWhoever reenters or is found within any such res-\n      ervation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installa-\n      tion, after having been removed therefrom or ordered\n      not to reenter by any officer or person in command or\n      charge thereof\u2014\n         \u201cShall be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n      more than six months, or both.\u201d\n   Apel does not dispute that he was \u201cfound within\u201d the\nlawful boundaries of Vandenberg, \u201cwithin the jurisdiction\nof the United States,\u201d after having been \u201cordered not to\nreenter\u201d by the Base commander. \u00a71382. And certainly\nVandenberg would naturally be described as a \u201cmilitary\ninstallation\u201d: it is an Air Force base, which a military\ncommander has closed to the public (with limited excep-\ntions), located on land owned by the United States and\nunder the jurisdiction of the Air Force, where military\npersonnel conduct sensitive missile operations.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n  Against this straightforward interpretation, Apel insists\nthat \u00a71382 applies only where the military exercises exclu-\nsive possession and control, which, he contends, does not\ninclude land subject to a roadway easement. Apel further\nargues that the fence enclosing Vandenberg\u2019s operational\nfacilities marks the real boundary of the Base and that\nVandenberg\u2019s commander lacks authority to control the\nrest, or at least the designated protest area. We take his\narguments in turn.\n                              A\n   Apel asserts that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s exclusive posses-\nsion and control requirement \u201cderives directly from the\ntext of \u00a71382.\u201d Brief for Respondent 23. It does not.\nSection 1382 is written broadly to apply to many different\nkinds of military places: a \u201creservation, post, fort, arsenal,\nyard, station, or installation.\u201d Nothing in the text defines\nthose places in terms of the access granted to the public or\nthe nature of the Government\u2019s possessory interest. See\nUnited States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 682 (1985) (\u201cThe\nlanguage of the statute does not limit \u00a71382 to military\nbases where access is restricted\u201d).\n   Apel contends that the listed military places have histor-\nically been defined as land withdrawn from public use.\nNot so. Historical sources are replete with references to\nmilitary \u201cforts\u201d and \u201cposts\u201d that provided services to civil-\nians, and were open for access by them. See, e.g., R.\nWooster, Soldiers, Sutlers, and Settlers 64 (1987) (\u201cThe\nfrontier forts of Texas were not simply army bases occu-\npied solely by military personnel. They were often bus-\ntling communities that attracted merchants, laborers,\nsettlers, and dependents\u201d); Davis, The Sutler at Fort\nBridger, 2 Western Hist. Q. 37, 37, 40\u201341 (Jan. 1971)\n(describing a 19th-century post in southwestern present\nWyoming which included a \u201csutler,\u201d a civilian merchant\nwho set up shop inside the fort and sold wares both to\n8                  UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsoldiers and to civilians from outside the base).\n   The common feature of the places described in \u00a71382 is\nnot that they are used exclusively by the military, but that\nthey have defined boundaries and are subject to the com-\nmand authority of a military officer. That makes sense,\nbecause the Solicitor General has informed us that a\nmilitary commander\u2019s authority is frequently defined by\nthe boundaries of a particular place: When the Depart-\nment of Defense establishes a base, military commanders\nassign a military unit to the base, and the commanding\nofficer of the unit becomes the commander of the base. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 6\u20137.\n   Apel responds by invoking our decision in United States\nv. Phisterer, 94 U. S. 219 (1877), which held that the term\n\u201cmilitary station\u201d (in a different statute) did not include\na soldier\u2019s off-base home. But Phisterer only confirms\nour conclusion that \u00a71382 does not require exclusive use,\npossession, or control. For there we interpreted \u201cmilitary\nstation\u201d to mean \u201ca place where troops are assembled,\nwhere military stores, animate or inanimate, are kept or\ndistributed, where military duty is performed or military\nprotection afforded,\u2014where something, in short, more or\nless closely connected with arms or war is kept or is to be\ndone.\u201d Id., at 222. To describe a place as \u201cmore or less\nclosely connected\u201d with military activities hardly requires\nthat the military hold an exclusive right to the property.\nRather, \u201cmilitary duty\u201d and \u201cmilitary protection\u201d are\nsynonymous with the exercise of military jurisdiction.\nAnd that, not coincidentally, is precisely how the term\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d is used elsewhere in federal law.\nSee, e.g., 10 U. S. C. \u00a72687(g)(1) (defining \u201cmilitary instal-\nlation\u201d as a \u201cbase . . . or other activity under the jurisdic-\ntion of the Department of Defense\u201d); \u00a72801(c)(4) (defining\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d as a \u201cbase . . . or other activity\nunder the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military de-\npartment\u201d); 32 CFR \u00a7809a.0 (\u201cThis part prescribes the\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Brief\nfor Respondent 44\u201347. So they have, and that is a point in\nhis favor. But those opinions are not intended to be bind-\ning. See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\u2019 Man-\nual \u00a71\u20131.100 (2009) (\u201cThe Manual provides only internal\nDepartment of Justice guidance. It is not intended to,\ndoes not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights,\nsubstantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party\nin any matter civil or criminal\u201d); 2 Civil Law Opinions\nof The Judge Advocate General, United States Air Force\n1978\u20131983 (Preface) (opinions of the Judge Advocate Gen-\neral \u201care good starting points but should not be cited\nas precedence [sic] without first verifying the validity of\nthe conclusions by independent research\u201d). Their views\nmay reflect overly cautious legal advice based on division\nin the lower courts. Or they may reflect legal error. Ei-\nther way, we have never held that the Government\u2019s\nreading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.\nSee Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 177 (1990)\n(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).\n   Today, as throughout our Nation\u2019s history, there is sig-\nnificant variation in the ownership status of U. S. mil-\nitary sites around the world. Some are owned in fee,\nothers are leased. Some are routinely open to the public,\nothers are open for specific occasions or purposes, and no\npublic access whatsoever is permitted on others. Many,\nincluding such well-known places as the Washington Navy\nYard and the United States Air Force Academy, have\nroads running through them that are used freely by the\npublic. Nothing in \u00a71382 or our history suggests that the\n10                UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute does not apply to a military base under the com-\nmand of the Air Force, merely because the Government\nhas conveyed a limited right to travel through a portion of\nthe base or to assemble in a particular area.\n                              B\n   Section 1382 is most naturally read to apply to places\nwith a defined boundary under the command of a military\nofficer. Apel argues, however, that Vandenberg\u2019s com-\nmander has no authority on the highways running\nthrough the Base or, apparently, in the designated protest\narea. His arguments more or less reduce to two conten-\ntions: that the highways and protest area lie \u201coutside the\nentrance to [a] closed military installation[],\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 22, and that they are \u201cuncontrolled\u201d spaces\nwhere \u201cno military operations are performed,\u201d id., at 23.\nNeither contention is sound.\n   First, to say that the highway and protest area are\n\u201coutside\u201d the Vandenberg installation is not a legal ar-\ngument; it simply assumes the conclusion. Perhaps recog-\nnizing as much, Apel tacks: He suggests that because\nVandenberg\u2019s operational facilities are surrounded by a fence\nand guarded by a security checkpoint, the Government\nhas determined that it does not control the rest of the\nBase. The problem with this argument is that the United\nStates has placed the entire Vandenberg property under\nthe administration of the Air Force, which has defined\nthat property as an Air Force base and designated the\nBase commander to exercise jurisdiction. Federal law\nmakes the commander responsible \u201cfor the protection or\nsecurity of \u201d \u201cproperty subject to the jurisdiction, admin-\nistration, or in the custody of the Department of Defense.\u201d\n50 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7797(a)(2), (4); see also 32 CFR \u00a7809a.2(a)\n(\u201cAir Force installation commanders are responsible for\nprotecting personnel and property under their jurisdic-\ntion\u201d). And pursuant to that authority, the Base com-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmander has issued an order closing the entire base to the\npublic. Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51; see\nalso 32 CFR \u00a7809a.3 (\u201cany directive issued by the com-\nmander of a military installation or facility, which in-\ncludes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from\na military installation, is legally enforceable against all\npersons\u201d). The fact that the Air Force chooses to secure\na portion of the Base more closely\u2014be it with a fence, a\ncheckpoint, or a painted green line\u2014does not alter the\nboundaries of the Base or diminish the jurisdiction of the\nmilitary commander.\n  As for Apel\u2019s claim that the protest area specifically is\nuncontrolled, the record is conclusively to the contrary.\nThe Base commander \u201cat all times has retained authority\nand control over who may access the installation,\u201d includ-\ning the protest area. Buck Memorandum Re: Protest\nActivity, App. 58. He has enacted rules to restrict the\nmanner of protests in the designated area. Protest Advi-\nsory, App. 53. In particular, he requires two weeks\u2019 notice\nto schedule a protest and prohibits the distribution of\npamphlets or leaflets. Id., at 52\u201353. The Base com-\nmander has also publicly stated that persons who are\nbarred from Vandenberg\u2014for whatever reason\u2014may not\ncome onto the Base to protest. Id., at 54. And the District\nCourt found, after hearing testimony, that \u201cthe Govern-\nment exercises substantial control over the designated\nprotest area, including, for example, patrolling the area.\u201d\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 14a\u201315a. Apel has never disputed\nthese facts.\n  Instead Apel tells us that, by granting an easement, the\nmilitary has \u201crelinquished its right to exclude civilians\nfrom Highway 1,\u201d Brief for Respondent 36, and that the\neasement does not \u201cpermit[ ]\u201d use by the military, id., at\n43. But the easement itself specifically reserves to Van-\ndenberg\u2019s commander the authority to restrict access to\nthe entire Base, including Highway 1, when necessary \u201cto\n12                 UNITED STATES v. APEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nproperly protect the interests of the United States,\u201d and\nlikewise \u201creserves to [the United States] rights-of-way for\nall purposes.\u201d Easement, App. 36. We simply do not\nunderstand how Apel can claim that \u201c[n]othing in the\neasement contemplates, or even permits, military use or\noccupation; it provides for exclusive civil use and occupa-\ntion.\u201d Brief for Respondent 43. Moreover, the Base com-\nmander, in an exercise of his command authority, has\nnotified the public that use of the roads is \u201climited to . . .\nvehicular travel activity through the base,\u201d which does not\ninclude Apel\u2019s protest activity. See Buck Memorandum\nRe: Closed Base, App. 51.\n   Apel likewise offers no support for his contention that\nmilitary functions do not occur on the easement highways.\nThe Government has referred us to instances when the\ncommander of Vandenberg has closed the highways to the\npublic for security purposes or when conducting a military\nlaunch. Reply Brief 12, and n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\u20139. In\nany event, there is no indication that Congress intended\n\u00a71382 to require base commanders to make continuous,\nuninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest\nthey lose authority to exclude individuals who have van-\ndalized military property and been determined to pose a\nthreat to the order and security of the base.\n   In sum, we decline Apel\u2019s invitation to require civilian\njudges to examine U. S. military sites around the world,\nparcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which\nhave fences, and which have a sufficiently important,\npersistent military purpose. The use-it-or-lose-it rule that\nApel proposes would frustrate the administration of mili-\ntary facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who\nare not expert in military operations. And it would dis-\ncourage commanders from opening portions of their bases\nfor the convenience of the public. We think a much better\nreading of \u00a71382 is that it reaches all property within the\ndefined boundaries of a military place that is under the\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

But the Court of Appeals never reached Apel\u2019s\nconstitutional arguments, and we decline to do so in the\nfirst instance. Apel also attempts to repackage his First\nAmendment objections as a statutory interpretation ar-\ngument based on constitutional avoidance. See Brief for\nRespondent 54 (\u201cthe statute should be interpreted . . . not\nto apply to peaceful protests on a public road outside of a\nclosed military base over which an easement has been\ngranted and that has been declared a protest zone\u201d). But\nwe do not \u201cinterpret\u201d statutes by gerrymandering them\nwith a list of exceptions that happen to describe a party\u2019s\ncase. \u201cThe canon [of constitutional avoidance] is not a\nmethod of adjudicating constitutional questions by other\nmeans.\u201d Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371, 381 (2005).\nWhether \u00a71382 is unconstitutional as applied is a question\nwe need not address.\n                        *     *    *\n  Where a place with a defined boundary is under the\nadministration of a military department, the limits of the\n\u201cmilitary installation\u201d for purposes of \u00a71382 are cotermi-\nnous with the commanding officer\u2019s area of responsibility.\nThose limits do not change when the commander invites\nthe public to use a portion of the base for a road, a school,\na bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the com-\nmander reserves authority to protect military property by,\namong other things, excluding vandals and trespassers.\n  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n                    APPENDIX\nSanta Maria-Highway 1 Gate to Vandenberg Air Force Base\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S. C. \u00a71382:\nThe military\u2019s choice \u201cto secure a portion of the Base more\nclosely\u2014be it with a fence, a checkpoint, or a painted\ngreen line\u2014does not alter the boundaries of the Base or\ndiminish the jurisdiction of the military commander.\u201d\nAnte, at 11. But a key inquiry remains, for the fence,\ncheckpoint, and painted line, while they do not alter\nthe Base boundaries, may alter the First Amendment\ncalculus.\n   When the Government permits the public onto part of\nits property, in either a traditional or designated public\nforum, its \u201cability to permissibly restrict expressive con-\nduct is very limited.\u201d United States v. Grace, 461 U. S.\n171, 177 (1983). In such venues, the Government may\nenforce \u201creasonable time, place, and manner regulations,\u201d\nbut those regulations must be \u201ccontent-neutral [and]\nnarrowly tailored to serve a significant government inter-\nest.\u201d Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The stated interest of the Air Force in keeping Apel out\nof the area designated for peaceful protest lies in ensuring\nbase security. Brief for United States 22\u201326. See also\nReply Brief 21\u201322. That interest, however, must be as-\nsessed in light of the general public\u2019s (including Apel\u2019s)\n2                 UNITED STATES v.

See Appendix to opinion of the Court, ante (display-\ning maps of the area). The Air Force also permits open\naccess to the middle school, bus stop, and visitors\u2019 center,\nall situated in close proximity to the protest area. See\nante, at 2.\n   As the Air Force has exhibited no \u201cspecial interes[t] in\nwho walks [or] talks\u201d in these places, Flower v. United\nStates, 407 U. S. 197, 198 (1972) (per curiam), it is ques-\ntionable whether Apel\u2019s ouster from the protest area can\nwithstand constitutional review. The Court has properly\nreserved that issue for consideration on remand. Ante, at\n13. In accord with that reservation, I join the Court\u2019s\nopinion.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.
