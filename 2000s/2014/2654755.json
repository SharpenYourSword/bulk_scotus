TROICE ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n\n   No. 12\u201379. Argued October 7, 2013\u2014Decided February 26, 2014*\nThe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (Litigation\n  Act or Act) forbids the bringing of large securities class actions \u201cbased\n  upon the statutory or common law of any State\u201d in which the plain-\n  tiffs allege \u201ca misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in con-\n  nection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n  \u00a778bb(f)(1). The Act defines \u201ccovered security\u201d to include, as relevant\n  here, only securities traded on a national exchange. \u00a7\u00a778bb(f)(5)(E),\n  77r(b)(1).\n     Four sets of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed civil class actions\n  under state law, contending that the defendants, petitioners here,\n  helped Allen Stanford and his companies perpetrate a Ponzi scheme\n  by falsely representing that uncovered securities (certificates of de-\n  posit in Stanford International Bank) that plaintiffs were purchasing\n  were backed by covered securities. The District Court dismissed each\n  case under the Litigation Act. Although the certificates of deposit\n  were not covered securities, the court concluded, the Bank\u2019s misrep-\n  resentation that its holdings in covered securities made investments\n  in its uncovered securities more secure provided the requisite \u201ccon-\n  nection\u201d (under the Litigation Act) between the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law\n  actions and transactions in covered securities. The Fifth Circuit re-\n  versed, concluding that the falsehoods about the Bank\u2019s holdings in\n  covered securities were too tangentially related to the fraud to trigger\n  the Litigation Act.\nHeld: The Litigation Act does not preclude the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law class\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 12\u201386, Willis of Colorado Inc. et al. v. Troice\net al., and No. 12\u201388, Proskauer Rose LLP v. Troice et al., also on certio-\nrari to the same court.\n2               CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    actions. Pp. 8\u201319.\n       (a) Several factors support the conclusion that the scope of\n    \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A)\u2019s phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material\n    fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security\u201d\n    does not extend further than misrepresentations that are material to\n    the decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to\n    purchase or sell a covered security. First, this interpretation is con-\n    sistent with the Act\u2019s basic focus on transactions in covered, not un-\n    covered, securities. Second, the interpretation is supported by the\n    Act\u2019s language. The phrase \u201cmaterial fact in connection with the\n    purchase or sale\u201d suggests a connection that matters. And a connec-\n    tion matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant differ-\n    ence to someone\u2019s decision to purchase or to sell a covered security,\n    not an uncovered one, something about which the Act expresses no\n    concern. See Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___,\n    ___. Further, for the connection to matter, the \u201csomeone\u201d making the\n    decision to purchase or sell a covered security must be a party other\n    than the fraudster. Third, the securities cases in which this Court\n    has found a fraud to be \u201cin connection with\u201d a purchase or sale of a\n    security, under both the Litigation Act and Section 10(b) of the Secu-\n    rities Exchange Act of 1934 (which also uses the \u201cin connection with\u201d\n    phrase), have involved victims who took, who tried to take, who di-\n    vested themselves of, who tried to divest themselves of, or who main-\n    tained an ownership interest in financial instruments that fall within\n    the relevant statutory definition. See, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\n    Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 77. Fourth, this Court\n    reads the Litigation Act in light of and consistent with the language\n    and purpose of the underlying regulatory statutes, the Securities Ex-\n    change Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, which refer to per-\n    sons engaged in securities transactions that lead to the taking or dis-\n    solving of ownership positions, and which make it illegal to deceive a\n    person when he or she is doing so. The basic purpose of the 1934 and\n    1933 regulatory statutes is to protect investor confidence in the secu-\n    rities markets. Nothing in those statutes, or in the Litigation Act,\n    suggests their object is to protect persons whose connection with the\n    statutorily defined securities is more remote than buying or selling.\n    Fifth, a broader interpretation of the necessary statutory \u201cconnec-\n    tion\u201d would interfere with state efforts to provide remedies for vic-\n    tims of ordinary state-law frauds, despite the fact that the Litigation\n    Act purposefully seeks to avoid such results by maintaining States\u2019\n    legal authority over matters that are primarily of state concern, see,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a778bb(f)(4). Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (b) Respondents and the Government make two important, but un-\n    availing, counterarguments. First, they point to this Court\u2019s sugges-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tions that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d should be given a broad in-\n  terpretation. But every case in which this Court interpreted the\n  phrase to cover a fraud involved a false statement (or the like) that\n  was \u201cmaterial\u201d to another individual\u2019s decision to \u201cpurchase or s[ell]\u201d\n  a statutorily defined \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201ccovered security,\u201d e.g., Dabit, su-\n  pra, at 75\u201377, and where the transaction was by or on behalf of\n  someone other than the fraudster. Second, the Government warns\n  that a narrow interpretation would curtail the Securities and Ex-\n  change Commission\u2019s enforcement powers under \u00a710(b) of the Securi-\n  ties Exchange Act, which uses the same \u201cin connection with the pur-\n  chase or sale\u201d phrase. To the contrary, this Court\u2019s interpretation is\n  perfectly consistent with past SEC practice. The authority of the\n  SEC and the Department of Justice extends to all \u201csecurities\u201d under\n  \u00a710(b), not just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U. S. C.\n  \u00a778c(a)(10). The SEC has accordingly brought successful enforce-\n  ment actions against Stanford and his associates, based on the\n  Bank\u2019s fraudulent sales of certificates of deposit\u2014products that are\n  \u201csecurities\u201d even if not \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Neither the Government\n  nor the dissent has pointed to an example of any prior SEC enforce-\n  ment action that the instant holding would have prevented the SEC\n  from bringing. Pp. 14\u201317.\n     (c) Respondents\u2019 complaints do not allege, for Litigation Act pur-\n  poses, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \u201cin connection\n  with\u201d the \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d At most, they al-\n  lege misrepresentations about the Bank\u2019s ownership of covered secu-\n  rities. But the Bank is the fraudster, not the fraudster\u2019s victim; nor\n  is it some other person transacting in covered securities. Thus, there\n  is not the necessary \u201cconnection\u201d between the materiality of the mis-\n  statements and the statutorily required \u201cpurchase or sale of a cov-\n  ered security.\u201d In addition, while the District Court found that one\n  plaintiff acquired Bank certificates with proceeds from the sale of\n  covered securities, the plaintiffs did not allege that the sale of these\n  covered securities constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme or\n  that Stanford or his associates were interested in how the plaintiffs\n  obtained the funds to purchase the certificates. Thus, those sales\n  were only incidental to the fraud. Pp. 17\u201319.\n675 F. 3d 503, affirmed.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

It says that plaintiffs may\nnot maintain a class action \u201cbased upon the statutory or\ncommon law of any State\u201d in which the plaintiffs allege \u201ca\nmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact in con-\nnection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1) (emphasis added). The Act defines\n2           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cclass actions\u201d as those involving more than 50 members.\nSee \u00a778bb(f)(5). It defines \u201ccovered security\u201d narrowly to\ninclude only securities traded on a national exchange (or,\nhere irrelevant, those issued by investment companies).\n\u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(5)(E), 77r(b)(1)\u2013(2).\n   The question before us is whether the Litigation Act\nencompasses a class action in which the plaintiffs allege\n(1) that they \u201cpurchase[d]\u201d uncovered securities (certifi\u00ad\ncates of deposit that are not traded on any national ex\u00ad\nchange), but (2) that the defendants falsely told the victims\nthat the uncovered securities were backed by covered\nsecurities. We note that the plaintiffs do not allege that\nthe defendants\u2019 misrepresentations led anyone to buy or to\nsell (or to maintain positions in) covered securities. Under\nthese circumstances, we conclude the Act does not apply.\n   In light of the dissent\u2019s characterization of our holding,\npost, at 11\u201312 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\u2014which we believe\nis incorrect\u2014we specify at the outset that this holding\ndoes not limit the Federal Government\u2019s authority to\nprosecute \u201cfrauds like the one here.\u201d Post, at 11. The\nFederal Government has in fact brought successful prose\u00ad\ncutions against the fraudsters at the heart of this litiga\u00ad\ntion, see infra, at 5\u20136, and we fail to understand the\ndissent\u2019s repeated suggestions to the contrary, post, at 3, 4,\n11, 12, 17. Rather, as we shall explain, we believe the\nbasic consequence of our holding is that, without limiting\nthe Federal Government\u2019s prosecution power in any sig-\nnificant way, it will permit victims of this (and similar)\nfrauds to recover damages under state law. See infra, at\n15\u201317. Under the dissent\u2019s approach, they would have no\nsuch ability.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n    The relevant statutory framework has four parts:\n\n    (1) Section 10(b) of the underlying regulatory\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)               3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j (2012 ed.). This well\u00ad\nknown statutory provision forbids the \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cem\u00ad\nploy[ment]\u201d of \u201cany manipulative or deceptive device or\ncontrivance\u201d \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of\nany security.\u201d \u00a778j(b).\n   Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\u20135 simi\u00ad\nlarly forbids the use of any \u201cdevice, scheme, or artifice to\ndefraud\u201d (including the making of \u201cany untrue statement\nof a material fact\u201d or any similar \u201comi[ssion]\u201d) \u201cin connec\u00ad\ntion with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 17 CFR\n\u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2013).\n   For purposes of these provisions, the Securities Ex\u00ad\nchange Act defines \u201csecurity\u201d broadly to include not just\nthings traded on national exchanges, but also \u201cany note,\nstock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,\nbond, debenture . . . [or] certificate of deposit for a security.\u201d\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778c(a)(10). See also \u00a7\u00a777b(a)(1), 80a\u20132(a)\n(36), 80b\u20132(a)(18) (providing virtually identical defini-\ntions of \u201csecurity\u201d for the Securities Act of 1933, the In\u00ad\nvestment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940).\n   (2) A statute-based private right of action. The\nCourt has read \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135 as providing injured\npersons with a private right of action to sue for damages\nsuffered through those provisions\u2019 violation. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 730\n(1975).\n   The scope of the private right of action is more limited\nthan the scope of the statutes upon which it is based. See\nStoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,\nInc., 552 U. S. 148, 153, 155, 166 (2008) (private right does\nnot cover suits against \u201csecondary actors\u201d who had no \u201crole\nin preparing or disseminating\u201d a stock issuer\u2019s fraudulent\n\u201cfinancial statements\u201d); Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 179\n4          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1994) (private right does not extend to actions against\n\u201caiders and abettors\u201d of securities fraud); Blue Chip\nStamps, supra, at 737 (private right extends only to pur\u00ad\nchasers and sellers, not to holders, of securities).\n   (3) The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995 (PSLRA). 109 Stat. 737, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a777z\u20131,\n78u\u20134. This law imposes procedural and substantive\nlimitations upon the scope of the private right of action\navailable under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135. It requires plain\u00ad\ntiffs to meet heightened pleading standards. It permits\ndefendants to obtain automatic stays of discovery. It\nlimits recoverable damages and attorney\u2019s fees. And it\ncreates a new \u201csafe harbor\u201d for forward-looking state\u00ad\nments. See \u00a7\u00a778u\u20134, 78u\u20135.\n   (4) The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards\nAct. 112 Stat. 3227, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f )(1)(A). As we said\nat the outset, this 1998 law forbids any\n    \u201ccovered class action based upon the statutory or\n    common law of any State . . . by any private party\n    alleging\u2014\n    \u201c(A) a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact\n    in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered\n    security; or\n    \u201c(B) that the defendant used or employed any manipu\u00ad\n    lative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection\n    with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d\n    \u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(1)(A)\u2013(B).\nThe law defines \u201ccovered security\u201d narrowly. It is a secu\u00ad\nrity that \u201csatisfies the standards for a covered security\nspecified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 18(b) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(E). And the relevant\nparagraphs of \u00a718(b) of the 1933 Act define a \u201ccovered\nsecurity\u201d as \u201c[a security] listed, or authorized for listing,\non a national securities exchange,\u201d \u00a777r(b)(1) (or, though\nnot relevant here, as a security issued by an \u201cinvestment\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany,\u201d \u00a777r(b)(2)). The Litigation Act also specifies\nthat a \u201ccovered security\u201d must be listed or authorized for\nlisting on a national exchange \u201cat the time during which it\nis alleged that the misrepresentation, omission, or manip\u00ad\nulative or deceptive conduct occurred.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(E).\n   The Litigation Act sets forth exceptions. It does not\napply to class actions with fewer than 51 \u201cpersons or\nprospective class members.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(B). It does not\napply to actions brought on behalf of a State itself.\n\u00a778bb(f )(3)(B)(i). It does not apply to class actions based\non the law \u201cof the State in which the issuer is incorpo\u00ad\nrated.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(3)(A)(i). And it reserves the authority of\nstate securities commissions \u201cto investigate and bring\nenforcement actions.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(4).\n   We are here primarily interested in the Litigation Act\u2019s\nphrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact\nin connection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu\u00ad\nrity.\u201d \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A). Unless this phrase applies to the class\nactions before us, the plaintiffs may maintain their state\u00ad\nlaw-based class actions, and they may do so either in\nfederal or state court. Otherwise, their class actions are\nprecluded altogether. See \u00a778bb(f )(2) (providing for the\nremoval from state to federal court of class actions that\nmeet the specifications of paragraph 1, and for the dismis\u00ad\nsal of such suits by the district court).\n                            B\n                            1\n  The plaintiffs in these actions (respondents here) say\nthat Allen Stanford and several of his companies ran a\nmultibillion dollar Ponzi scheme. Essentially, Stanford\nand his companies sold the plaintiffs certificates of deposit\nin Stanford International Bank. Those certificates \u201cwere\ndebt assets that promised a fixed rate of return.\u201d Roland\nv. Green, 675 F. 3d 503, 522 (CA5 2012). The plaintiffs\nexpected that Stanford International Bank would use the\n6          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoney it received to buy highly lucrative assets. But\ninstead, Stanford and his associates used the money pro\u00ad\nvided by new investors to repay old investors, to finance\nan elaborate lifestyle, and to finance speculative real\nestate ventures.\n   The Department of Justice brought related criminal\ncharges against Allen Stanford. A jury convicted Stanford\nof mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money\nlaundering, and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange\nCommission investigation. Stanford was sentenced to\nprison and required to forfeit $6 billion. The SEC, noting\nthat the Bank certificates of deposit fell within the 1934\nSecurities Exchange Act\u2019s broad definition of \u201csecurity,\u201d\nfiled a \u00a710(b) civil case against Allen Stanford, the Stan\u00ad\nford International Bank, and related Stanford companies\nand associates. The SEC won the civil action, and the\ncourt imposed a civil penalty of $6 billion.\n                             2\n  The plaintiffs in each of the four civil class actions are\nprivate investors who bought the Bank\u2019s certificates of\ndeposit. Two groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in\nLouisiana state court against firms and individuals who\nhelped sell the Bank\u2019s certificates by working as \u201cinvest\u00ad\nment advisers\u201d affiliated with Stanford, or who provided\nStanford-related companies with trust, insurance, ac\u00ad\ncounting, or reporting services. (The defendants included\na respondent here, SEI Investments Company.) The\nplaintiffs claimed that the defendants helped the Bank\nperpetrate the fraud, thereby violating Louisiana state\nlaw.\n  Two other groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in\nfederal court for the Northern District of Texas. One\ngroup sued Willis of Colorado (and related Willis compa\u00ad\nnies) and Bowen, Miclette & Britt, two insurance brokers;\nthe other group sued Proskauer Rose and Chadbourne &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nParke, two law firms. Both groups claimed that the de\u00ad\nfendants helped the Bank (and Allen Stanford) perpetrate\nthe fraud or conceal it from regulators, thereby violating\nTexas securities law.\n    The Louisiana state-court defendants removed their\ncases to federal court, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-\nDistrict Litigation moved the Louisiana cases to the\nNorthern District of Texas. A single federal judge heard\nall four class actions.\n    The defendants in each of the cases moved to dismiss\nthe complaints. The District Court concluded that the\nLitigation Act required dismissal. The court recognized\nthat the certificates of deposit themselves were not \u201ccov\u00ad\nered securities\u201d under the Litigation Act, for they were not\n\u201c \u2018traded nationally [or] listed on a regulated national\nexchange.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 12\u201386, p. 62.\nBut each complaint in one way or another alleged that\nthe fraud included misrepresentations that the Bank\nmaintained significant holdings in \u201c \u2018highly marketable se-\ncurities issued by stable governments [and] strong mul-\ntinational companies,\u2019 \u201d and that the Bank\u2019s ownership of\nthese \u201ccovered\u201d securities made investments in the uncovered\ncertificates more secure. Id., at 66. The court concluded\nthat this circumstance provided the requisite statutory\n\u201cconnection\u201d between (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law fraud\nclaims, and (2) \u201ctransactions in covered securities.\u201d Id., at\n64, 66\u201367. Hence, the court dismissed the class actions\nunder the Litigation Act. Id., at 75. See also 675 F. 3d,\nat 511.\n    All four sets of plaintiffs appealed. The Fifth Circuit\nreversed. It agreed with the District Court that the com\u00ad\nplaints described misrepresentations about the Bank\u2019s\ninvestments in nationally traded securities. Still, the\n\u201cheart, crux, and gravamen of \u201d the \u201callegedly fraudulent\nscheme was representing . . . that the [uncovered] CDs\nwere a \u2018safe and secure\u2019 investment that was preferable to\n8           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nother investments for many reasons.\u201d Id., at 522. The\ncourt held that the falsehoods about the Bank\u2019s holdings\nin covered securities were too \u201c \u2018tangentially related\u2019 \u201d to\nthe \u201ccrux\u201d of the fraud to trigger the Litigation Act. Id., at\n520, 522 (quoting Madden v. Cowen & Co., 576 F. 3d 957,\n965\u2013966 (CA9 2009)). \u201cThat the CDs were marketed with\nsome vague references to [the Bank\u2019s] portfolio containing\ninstruments that might be [covered by the Litigation Act]\nseems tangential to the schemes,\u201d to the point where the\ncomplaints fall outside the scope of that Act. 675 F. 3d,\nat 522.\n  Defendants in the four class actions sought certiorari.\nWe granted their petitions.\n                               II\n   The question before us concerns the scope of the Litiga\u00ad\ntion Act\u2019s phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a\nmaterial fact in connection with the purchase or sale of\na covered security.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(1)(A). How broad is that\nscope? Does it extend further than misrepresentations\nthat are material to the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity?\n   In our view, the scope of this language does not extend\nfurther. To put the matter more specifically: A fraudulent\nmisrepresentation or omission is not made \u201cin connection\nwith\u201d such a \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security\u201d un\u00ad\nless it is material to a decision by one or more individuals\n(other than the fraudster) to buy or to sell a \u201ccovered\nsecurity.\u201d We add that in Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71 (2006), we held that the\nLitigation Act precluded a suit where the plaintiffs alleged\na \u201cfraudulent manipulation of stock prices\u201d that was mate\u00ad\nrial to and \u201c \u2018concide[d]\u2019 with\u201d third-party securities trans\u00ad\nactions, while also inducing the plaintiffs to \u201chold their\nstocks long beyond the point when, had the truth been\nknown, they would have sold.\u201d Id., at 75, 85, 89 (citing\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651 (1997)). We\ndo not here modify Dabit.\n                                 A\n   We reach this interpretation of the Litigation Act for\nseveral reasons. First, the Act focuses upon transactions\nin covered securities, not upon transactions in uncovered\nsecurities. An interpretation that insists upon a material\nconnection with a transaction in a covered security is\nconsistent with the Act\u2019s basic focus.\n   Second, a natural reading of the Act\u2019s language supports\nour interpretation. The language requires the dismissal of\na state-law-based class action where a private party alleges\na \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact\u201d (or\nengages in other forms of deception, not relevant here) \u201cin\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu\u00ad\nrity.\u201d \u00a778bb(f)(1). The phrase \u201cmaterial fact in connection\nwith the purchase or sale\u201d suggests a connection that\nmatters. And for present purposes, a connection matters\nwhere the misrepresentation makes a significant differ\u00ad\nence to someone\u2019s decision to purchase or to sell a covered\nsecurity, not to purchase or to sell an uncovered security,\nsomething about which the Act expresses no concern. See\ngenerally Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u201312) (a misrepresentation or\nomission is \u201cmaterial\u201d if a reasonable investor would have\nconsidered the information significant when contemplat\u00ad\ning a statutorily relevant investment decision). Further,\nthe \u201csomeone\u201d making that decision to purchase or sell\nmust be a party other than the fraudster. If the only party\nwho decides to buy or sell a covered security as a result of\na lie is the liar, that is not a \u201cconnection\u201d that matters.\n   Third, prior case law supports our interpretation. As far\nas we are aware, every securities case in which this Court\nhas found a fraud to be \u201cin connection with\u201d a purchase or\nsale of a security has involved victims who took, who tried\n10         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto take, who divested themselves of, who tried to divest\nthemselves of, or who maintained an ownership interest in\nfinancial instruments that fall within the relevant statu\u00ad\ntory definition. See, e.g., Dabit, supra, at 77 (Litigation\nAct: victims were \u201cholders\u201d of covered securities that the\ndefendant\u2019s fraud caused to become overvalued); SEC v.\nZandford, 535 U. S. 813, 822 (2002) (\u00a710(b): victims were\n\u201cduped into believing\u201d that the defendant would \u201c \u2018invest\u2019\ntheir assets in the stock market\u201d); Wharf (Holdings) Ltd.\nv. United Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc., 532 U. S. 588, 592 (2001)\n(\u00a710(b): victim purchased an oral option to buy 10% of a\ncompany\u2019s stock); O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 655\u2013656 (\u00a710(b):\nvictims were \u201cmembers of the investing public\u201d harmed by\nthe defendant\u2019s \u201cgain[ing of an] advantageous market\nposition\u201d through insider trading); Superintendent of Ins.\nof N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U. S. 6, 10\n(1971) (\u00a710(b): victim was \u201cinjured as an investor\u201d when\nthe fraud deprived it of \u201ccompensation for the sale of its\nvaluable block of securities\u201d). We have found no Court\ncase involving a fraud \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase or\nsale of a statutorily defined security in which the victims\ndid not fit one of these descriptions. And the dissent\napparently has not either.\n   Although the dissent characterizes our approach as\n\u201cnew,\u201d post, at 3, and tries to describe several of our prior\ncases, such as Zanford or Dabit, in a different way, post, at\n14\u201315, it cannot escape the fact that every case it cites\ninvolved a victim who took, tried to take, or maintained an\nownership position in the statutorily relevant securities\nthrough \u201cpurchases\u201d or \u201csales\u201d induced by the fraud. E.g.,\nZandford, supra, at 815, 820 (fraudster told customers\nhe would \u201c \u2018conservatively invest\u2019 their money\u201d in the stock\nmarket and made sales of \u201chis customer\u2019s securities,\u201d\nbut pocketed the proceeds (emphasis added)); Dabit, supra,\nat 76, 85, 89 (the \u201cmisrepresentations and manipulative\ntactics caused [the plaintiffs] to hold onto overvalued\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurities\u201d while also inducing third parties to trade\nthem); In re Orlando Joseph Jett, 82 S. E. C. Docket 1211,\n1236\u20131237 (2004) (trader\u2019s scheme \u201cgreatly inflated the\nreporting trading profits\u201d that his firm \u201cused to determine\n. . . the amount of capital he was permitted to commit on\nthe firm\u2019s behalf \u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Fourth, we read the Litigation Act in light of and con\u00ad\nsistent with the underlying regulatory statutes, the Secu\u00ad\nrities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe regulatory statutes refer to persons engaged in securi\u00ad\nties transactions that lead to the taking or dissolving of\nownership positions. And they make it illegal to deceive a\nperson when he or she is doing so. Section 5 of the 1933\nAct, for example, makes it unlawful to \u201coffer to sell or offer\nto buy . . . any security, unless a registration statement\nhas been filed as to such security.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a777e(c).\nSection 17 of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful \u201cin the offer\nor sale of any securities . . . to employ any device, scheme,\nor artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property\nby means of any untrue statement of a material fact.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a777q(a)(1)\u2013(2). And \u00a710(b) of the 1934 Act makes it\nunlawful to \u201cuse or employ, in connection with the pur\u00ad\nchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or de-\nceptive device or contrivance.\u201d \u00a778j(b).\n   Not only language but also purpose suggests a statutory\nfocus upon transactions involving the statutorily relevant\nsecurities. The basic purpose of the 1934 and 1933 regula\u00ad\ntory statutes is \u201cto insure honest securities markets and\nthereby promote investor confidence.\u201d See O\u2019Hagan, su-\npra, at 658. Nothing in the regulatory statutes suggests\ntheir object is to protect persons whose connection with\nthe statutorily defined securities is more remote than\nwords such as \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201csell,\u201d and the like, indicate. Nor\ndoes anything in the Litigation Act provide us with rea\u00ad\nsons for interpreting its similar language more broadly.\n   The dissent correctly points out that the federal securi\u00ad\n12         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nties laws have another purpose, beyond protecting inves\u00ad\ntors. Namely, they also seek to protect securities issuers,\nas well as the investment advisers, accountants, and\nbrokers who help them sell financial products, from abu\u00ad\nsive class-action lawsuits. Post, at 5. Both the PSLRA\nand the Litigation Act were enacted in service of that goal.\nBy imposing heightened pleading standards, limiting\ndamages, and pre-empting state-law suits where the\nclaims pertained to covered securities, Congress sought to\nreduce frivolous suits and mitigate legal costs for firms\nand investment professionals that participate in the mar\u00ad\nket for nationally traded securities.\n   We fail to see, however, how our decision today under\u00ad\nmines that objective. The dissent worries our approach\nwill \u201csubject many persons and entities whose profession it\nis to give advice, counsel, and assistance in investing in\nthe securities markets to complex and costly state-law\nlitigation.\u201d Post, at 4. To the contrary, the only issuers,\ninvestment advisers, or accountants that today\u2019s decision\nwill continue to subject to state-law liability are those who\ndo not sell or participate in selling securities traded on\nU. S. national exchanges. We concede that this means a\nbank, chartered in Antigua and whose sole product is a\nfixed-rate debt instrument not traded on a U. S. exchange,\nwill not be able to claim the benefit of preclusion under the\nLitigation Act. But it is difficult to see why the federal\nsecurities laws would be\u2014or should be\u2014concerned with\nshielding such entities from lawsuits.\n   Fifth, to interpret the necessary statutory \u201cconnection\u201d\nmore broadly than we do here would interfere with state\nefforts to provide remedies for victims of ordinary state\u00ad\nlaw frauds. A broader interpretation would allow the\nLitigation Act to cover, and thereby to prohibit, a lawsuit\nbrought by creditors of a small business that falsely repre\u00ad\nsented it was creditworthy, in part because it owns or\nintends to own exchange-traded stock. It could prohibit a\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Its proposed rule is that\nwhenever \u201cthe purchase or sale of the securities [including\nby the fraudster] is what enables the fraud,\u201d the Litigation\nAct pre-empts the suit. Post, at 12. In other words, any\ntime one person convinces another to loan him money, by\npretending he owns nationally traded securities or will\nacquire them for himself in the future, the action consti\u00ad\ntutes federal securities fraud, is subject to federal en\u00ad\nforcement, and is also precluded by the Litigation Act if it\nqualifies as a \u201ccovered class action\u201d under \u00a778bb(f )(5)(B)\n(e.g., involves more than 50 members). Leaving aside\nwhether this would work a significant expansion of the\nscope of liability under the federal securities laws, it un\u00ad\nquestionably would limit the scope of protection under\nstate laws that seek to provide remedies to victims of\ngarden-variety fraud.\n   The text of the Litigation Act reflects congressional care\nto avoid such results. Under numerous provisions, it\npurposefully maintains state legal authority, especially\nover matters that are primarily of state concern. See\n\u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(1)(A)\u2013(B) (limiting preclusion to lawsuits in-\nvolving \u201ccovered,\u201d i.e., nationally traded, securities);\n\u00a778bb(f )(4) (providing that the \u201csecurities commission . . .\nof any State shall retain jurisdiction under the laws of\nsuch State to investigate and bring enforcement actions\u201d);\n\u00a778bb(f )(3)(B) (preserving States\u2019 authority to bring suits\nof the kind forbidden to private class-action plaintiffs).\nSee also 112 Stat. 3227 (\u201cCongress finds that . . . it is\nappropriate to enact national standards for securities class\naction lawsuits involving nationally traded securities,\n14          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhile preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of\nState securities regulators\u201d). A broad interpretation of the\nLitigation Act works at cross-purposes with this state\u00ad\noriented concern. Cf. Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820 (warning\nagainst \u201cconstru[ing]\u201d the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d \u201cso\nbroadly as to convert any common-law fraud that happens\nto involve securities into a violation of \u00a710(b)\u201d); Wharf\n(Holdings) Ltd., 532 U.

Respondents point to statements we\nhave made suggesting we should give the phrase \u201cin con\u00ad\nnection with\u201d a broad interpretation. In Dabit, for exam\u00ad\nple, we said that the Court has consistently \u201cespoused a\nbroad interpretation\u201d of \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context\nof \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135, and we added that the Litiga\u00ad\ntion Act language similarly warranted a \u201cbroad construc\u00ad\ntion.\u201d 547 U.

In Bankers Life, we said that,\nif a deceptive practice \u201ctouch[es]\u201d a securities transaction,\nit meets \u00a710(b)\u2019s \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, 404\nU.

The idea, we explained in Zandford, is that\nthe phrase \u201cshould be \u2018construed not technically and re\u00ad\nstrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u2019 \u201d\n535 U. S., at 819 (quoting Affiliated Ute Citizens of\nUtah v. United States, 406 U. S. 128, 151 (1972)).\n   Every one of these cases, however, concerned a false\nstatement (or the like) that was \u201cmaterial\u201d to another\nindividual\u2019s decision to \u201cpurchase or s[ell]\u201d a statutorily\ndefined \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201ccovered security.\u201d Dabit, supra, at\n75\u201377; Zandford, supra, at 822; Wharf (Holdings) Ltd.,\nsupra, at 590\u2013592; O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 655\u2013657; Bankers\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

And the relevant statements or omis\u00ad\nsions were material to a transaction in the relevant securi\u00ad\nties by or on behalf of someone other than the fraudster.\n   Second, the Government points out that \u00a710(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act also uses the phrase \u201cin connec\u00ad\ntion with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778j(b). And the Government warns that a narrow inter\u00ad\npretation of \u201cin connection with\u201d here threatens a simi-\nlarly narrow interpretation there, which could limit the\nSEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 28.\n   We do not understand, however, how our interpretation\ncould significantly curtail the SEC\u2019s enforcement powers.\nAs far as the Government has explained the matter, our\ninterpretation seems perfectly consistent with past SEC\npractice. For one thing, we have cast no doubt on the\nSEC\u2019s ability to bring enforcement actions against Stan\u00ad\nford and Stanford International Bank. The SEC has\nalready done so successfully. As we have repeatedly\npointed out, the term \u201csecurity\u201d under \u00a710(b) covers a wide\nrange of financial products beyond those traded on national\nexchanges, apparently including the Bank\u2019s certificates\nof deposit at issue in these cases. No one here denies that,\nfor \u00a710(b) purposes, the \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentations by\nStanford and his associates were made \u201cin connection\nwith\u201d the \u201cpurchases\u201d of those certificates.\n   We find it surprising that the dissent worries that our\ndecision will \u201cnarro[w] and constric[t] essential protection\nfor our national securities market,\u201d post, at 3, and put\n\u201cfrauds like the one here . . . not within the reach of fed-\neral regulation,\u201d post, at 11. That would be news to Allen\nStanford, who was sentenced to 110 years in federal prison\nafter a successful federal prosecution, and to Stanford\nInternational Bank, which was ordered to pay billions in\nfederal fines, after the same. Frauds like the one here\u2014\nincluding this fraud itself\u2014will continue to be within the\n16         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreach of federal regulation because the authority of the\nSEC and Department of Justice extends to all \u201csecurities,\u201d\nnot just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(10); accord, \u00a777b(a)(1), \u00a780a\u20132(a)(36), \u00a780b\u2013\n2(a)(18). When the fraudster peddles an uncovered secu-\nrity like the CDs here, the Federal Government will have\nthe full scope of its usual powers to act. The only differ\u00ad\nence between our approach and that of the dissent, is that\nwe also preserve the ability for investors to obtain relief\nunder state laws when the fraud bears so remote a connec\u00ad\ntion to the national securities market that no person\nactually believed he was taking an ownership position in\nthat market.\n   Thus, despite the Government\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s hand\nwringing, neither has been able to point to an example of\nany prior SEC enforcement action brought during the past\n80 years that our holding today would have prevented the\nSEC from bringing. At oral argument, the Government\nreferred to an administrative proceeding, In re Richard\nLine, 62 S. E. C. Docket 2879 (1996), as its best example.\nOur examination of the report of that case, however, indi\u00ad\ncates that the defendant was a fraudster to whom the\nfraud\u2019s victims had loaned money, expecting that he would\npurchase securities on their behalf.

They claimed Stanford \u201ctouted the high quality of\nSIB\u2019s investment portfolio,\u201d and such falsehoods were\nmaterial to their decision to purchase the uncovered certif\u00ad\nicates. Id., at 444.\n   (2) The second set of Texas plaintiffs contended that\nthey, too, purchased the Bank\u2019s certificates on the belief\n\u201cthat their money was being invested in safe, liquid in\u00ad\nvestments.\u201d Id., at 715. They alleged that the Bank\u2019s\nmarketing materials stated it devoted \u201cthe greater part of\nits assets\u201d to \u201cfirst grade investment bonds (AAA, AA+,\nAA) and shares of stock (of great reputation, liquidity, and\ncredibility).\u201d Id., at 744 (emphasis deleted).\n   (3) Both groups of Louisiana plaintiffs alleged that they\nwere induced to purchase the certificates based on misrep\u00ad\nresentations that the Bank\u2019s assets were \u201c \u2018invested in a\nwell-diversified portfolio of highly marketable securities\nissued by stable governments, strong multinational com\u00ad\npanies and major international banks.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 253, 345.\nAnd they claimed the \u201c \u2018liquidity/marketability of SIB\u2019s\ninvested assets\u2019 \u201d was \u201cthe most important factor to pro\u00ad\nvide security to SIB clients.\u201d Id., at 254.\n   These statements do not allege, for Litigation Act pur\u00ad\nposes, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \u201cin\nconnection with\u201d the \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered secu-\nrity.\u201d At most, the complaints allege misrepresentations\nabout the Bank\u2019s ownership of covered securities\u2014\nfraudulent assurances that the Bank owned, would own,\nor would use the victims\u2019 money to buy for itself shares of\ncovered securities. But the Bank is an entity that made\nthe misrepresentations. The Bank is the fraudster, not\nthe fraudster\u2019s victim. Nor is the Bank some other person\ntransacting (or refraining from transacting, see Dabit, 547\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

And consequently,\nthere is not the necessary \u201cconnection\u201d between the mate\u00ad\nriality of the misstatements and the statutorily required\n\u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d See supra, at 8.\n  A final point: The District Court found that one of the\nplaintiffs acquired Bank certificates \u201cwith the proceeds of\nselling\u201d covered securities contained in his IRA portfolio.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 12\u201386, p. 70. The plaintiffs,\nhowever, did not allege that the sale of these covered\nsecurities (which were used to finance the purchase of the\ncertificates) constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme.\nNor did the complaints allege that Stanford or his associ\u00ad\nates were at all interested in how the plaintiffs obtained\nthe funds they needed to purchase the certificates. Thus,\nwe agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c[u]nlike Bankers\nLife and Zandford, where the entirety of the fraud de\u00ad\npended upon the tortfeasor convincing the victims of those\nfraudulent schemes to sell their covered securities in order\nfor the fraud to be accomplished, the allegations here are\nnot so tied with the sale of covered securities.\u201d 675 F. 3d,\nat 523. In our view, like that of the Court of Appeals,\nthese sales constituted no relevant part of the fraud but\nwere rather incidental to it.\n  For these reasons the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is\naffirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

For pur-\nposes of this litigation all accept the premise that Allen\nStanford and SIB induced the investors to purchase the\nCDs by fraudulent representations. In various state and\nfederal courts the investors filed state-law suits against\npersons and entities, including attorneys, accountants,\nbrokers, and investment advisers, alleging that they par-\nticipated in or enabled the fraud. The defendants in the\nstate-court suits removed the actions to federal court,\nwhere they were consolidated with the federal-court suits.\n2          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nThe defendants contended that the state-law suits are\nprecluded under the terms of the Securities Litigation\nUniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA or Act), 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778bb(f)(1). As the investors prevailed in the Court of\nAppeals, they are the respondents here. The persons and\nentities who were defendants in the state-law actions are\nthe petitioners. The investors contend the state-law suits\nare not precluded by SLUSA, and the petitioners contend\nthe suits are precluded.\n   For purposes of determining SLUSA\u2019s reach, all can\nagree that the CD purchases would not have been, without\nmore, transactions regulated by that Act; for the CDs were\nnot themselves covered securities. As a result, in deter-\nmining whether the Act must be invoked, a further cir-\ncumstance must be considered: The investors purchased\nthe CDs based on the misrepresentations that the CDs\nwere, or would be, backed by investments in, among other\nassets, covered securities.\n   What must be resolved, to determine whether the Act\nprecludes the state-law suits at issue, is whether the\nmisrepresentations regarding covered securities and the\nensuing failure to invest in those securities were so related\nto the purchase of the CDs that the misrepresentations\nwere \u201cmisrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of a material\nfact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A).\n   The opinion for the Court, it seems fair to say, adopts\nthis beginning framework, and it is quite correct to do so.\nThe Court is further correct to view this litigation as in-\nvolving a fraud of a type, scale, and perhaps sophistica-\ntion that has not yet been addressed in its precedents with\nrespect to the applicability of the federal securities laws.\n   It is the premise of this dissent that the more simple\nfrauds addressed in this Court\u2019s precedents, where the\nCourt did find fraud \u201cin connection with the purchase or\nsale,\u201d are applicable here. In those cases, as here, the\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nimmediate cause of loss to the victim of the fraud was not\nsimply a purchase or sale but rather a fraud that depended\non the purchase or sale of securities or the promise to\ndo so. It is submitted that this litigation should not come\nout differently simply because the fraud here was so wide-\nspread that many investors were misled by misrepresenta-\ntions respecting investments, or promised investments, in\nregulated securities in the markets. And it is necessary to\ncaution that, in holding otherwise, the Court adopts a new\napproach, an approach which departs from the rules es-\ntablished in the earlier, albeit simpler, cases. And, as a\nconsequence, today\u2019s decision, to a serious degree, narrows\nand constricts essential protection for our national securi-\nties markets, protection vital for their strength and in-\ntegrity. The result will be a lessened confidence in the\nmarket, a force for instability that should otherwise be\ncountered by the proper interpretation of federal securities\nlaws and regulations. Though the reasons supporting the\nCourt\u2019s opinion are set forth with care and clarity, this\nrespectful dissent submits that established principles do\nnot support its holding.\n                                I\n    It must be determined whether the misrepresentations\nto the investors\u2014misrepresentations that led them to buy\nCDs in the belief they could rely on the expertise and\nsophistication of Stanford and SIB in the national securi-\nties markets\u2014were \u201cmisrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of\n. . . material fact[s] in connection with the purchase or sale\nof a covered security.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1). This is the\ncentral provision of SLUSA for purposes of this litigation.\nThe Court\u2019s precedents instruct that this language has\nbroad application and must be construed flexibly in order\nto encompass new and ever more ingenious fraudulent\nschemes. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v.\nDabit, 547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006); SEC v. Zandford, 535 U. S.\n4           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n813, 819 (2002). The Court has held that a material mis-\nrepresentation is made \u201cin connection with the purchase\nor sale\u201d of a security when the \u201cfraud coincided with the\nsales [or purchases] themselves.\u201d Zandford, supra, at 820.\n   This significant language must apply here in order to\nimplement two of Congress\u2019 purposes in passing SLUSA.\nFirst, SLUSA seeks to preclude a broad range of state-\nlaw securities claims in order to protect those who advise,\ncounsel, and otherwise assist investors from abusive and\nmultiplicitous class actions designed to extract settlements\nfrom defendants vulnerable to litigation costs. This,\nin turn, protects the integrity of the markets. Second,\neven as the Act cuts back on the availability of state-law\nsecurities claims, a fair interpretation of its language\nensures robust federal regulation of the national securities\nmarkets. That is because, in designing SLUSA, Congress\n\u201cimported the key phrase\u201d from \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135, which provide a private cause\nof action, as well as SEC enforcement authority, for secu-\nrities fraud. Dabit, 547 U. S., at 79, 85. As a result, that\nlanguage must be \u201c \u2018presumed to have the same meaning\u2019 \u201d\nin SLUSA as it does in those contexts. Id., at 86.\n   The Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Act\u2019s language\nwill inhibit the SEC and litigants from using federal law\nto police frauds and abuses that undermine confidence in\nthe national securities markets. Throughout the country,\nthen, it will subject many persons and entities whose\nprofession it is to give advice, counsel, and assistance in\ninvesting in the securities markets to complex and costly\nstate-law litigation based on allegations of aiding or par-\nticipating in transactions that are in fact regulated by the\nfederal securities laws.\n                          A\n    Congress enacted SLUSA and its predecessor, the Pri-\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S.,\nat 81. Congress found that these abuses were being used\n\u201cto injure \u2018the entire U. S. economy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The Act and\nits predecessor together addressed these problems by\nlimiting damages, imposing heightened pleading stand-\nards, and, as most relevant here, precluding state-law\nclaims involving nationally traded securities. 112 Stat.\n3227; see S. Rep. No. 104\u201398, pp. 19\u201320 (1995); H. R. Rep.\nNo. 105\u2013640, p. 10 (1998); S. Rep. No. 105\u2013182, pp. 3\u20134\n(1998).\n   In light of the Act\u2019s objectives, the Act must be given\na \u201cbroad construction,\u201d because a \u201cnarrow reading of the\nstatute would undercut the effectiveness\u201d of Congress\u2019\nreforms. Dabit, supra, at 86. Today\u2019s decision does not\nheed that principle. The Court\u2019s narrow reading of the\nstatute will permit proliferation of state-law class actions,\nforcing defendants to defend against multiple suits in\nvarious state fora. This state-law litigation will drive up\nlegal costs for market participants and the secondary\nactors, such as lawyers, accountants, brokers, and advis-\ners, who seek to rely on the stability that results from a\nnational securities market regulated by federal law. See\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 189 (1994). This is a serious\nburden to put on attorneys, accountants, brokers, and\ninvestment advisers nationwide; and that burden itself\nwill make the national securities markets more costly and\ndifficult to enter. The purpose of the Act is to preclude\njust these suits. By permitting the very state-law claims\nCongress intended to prohibit, the Court will undermine\nthe primacy of federal law in policing abuses in the securi-\nties markets.\n   The Court casts its rule as allowing victims to recover\nagainst secondary actors under state law when they would\n6           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nnot be able to recover under federal law due to Central\nBank. Ante, at 12, 17. But in Dabit a unanimous Court\nrejected that conception of SLUSA. A federal-law claim\nwas not available to the plaintiffs in Dabit because Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975),\nlimited the Rule 10b\u20135 private right of action to purchas-\ners and sellers, not holders. \u201c[T]he Second Circuit held\nthat SLUSA only pre-empts state-law class action claims\nbrought by plaintiffs who have a private remedy under\nfederal law.\u201d 547 U. S., at 74. The Court held the oppo-\nsite, \u201cconcluding that SLUSA pre-empts state-law holder\nclass-action claims.\u201d Id., at 87. \u201cIt would be odd, to say\nthe least,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cif SLUSA exempted that\nparticularly troublesome subset of class actions from its\npre-emptive sweep.\u201d Id., at 86. The Court in Dabit also\nnoted that SLUSA preclusion does not leave victims with\n\u201cno\u201d ability to \u201crecover damages under state law.\u201d Ante, at\n2. Rather, \u201c[i]t simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the\nclass-action device to vindicate certain claims.\u201d 547 U. S.,\nat 87. The Court in Dabit precluded the suit at issue in\norder to effect the purpose of Blue Chip. By following the\nopposite course today, the Court revisits Dabit\u2019s logic and\nundermines Central Bank.\n                               B\n    Congress intended to make \u201cfederal law, not state law,\n. . . the principal vehicle for asserting class-action securi-\nties fraud claims.\u201d Dabit, supra, at 88. And a broad con-\nstruction of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language found in\nboth SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135 ensures an efficient and\neffective federal regulatory regime, one equal to the task\nof deterring and punishing fraud and providing compensa-\ntion for victims.\n    In undertaking regulation of the national markets\nduring the Great Depression, Congress sought to elimi-\nnate the \u201cabuses which were found to have contributed to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In the Securi-\nties Exchange Act, Congress sought \u201c \u2018to achieve a high\nstandard of business ethics in the securities industry\u2019 \u201d\nby \u201c \u2018substitut[ing] a philosophy of full disclosure for the\nphilosophy of caveat emptor.\u2019 \u201d Affiliated Ute Citizens of\nUtah v.

O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 658 (1997).\n    Investor confidence indicates fair dealing and integrity\nin the markets. See Dabit, supra, at 78; O\u2019Hagan, supra,\nat 658; see also Central Bank, supra, at 188. It also is\ncritical to achieving an efficient market. The corollary to\nthe principle that insider trading and other frauds have an\n\u201cinhibiting impact on market participation\u201d is that inves-\ntor confidence in strong federal regulation to prevent these\nabuses inspires participation in the market. See O\u2019Hagan,\nsupra, at 659. Widespread market participation in turn\nfacilitates efficient allocation of capital to the Nation\u2019s\ncompanies. See also Central Bank, supra, at 188.\n                              C\n  Mindful of the ends of both SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135, the\nCourt\u2019s precedents interpret the key phrase in both laws\nto mean that a \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a mate-\nrial fact\u201d is made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d\nof a security when the \u201cfraud coincided with the sales [or\npurchases] themselves.\u201d Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820; see\nalso Dabit, supra, at 85.\n8          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   This litigation is very similar to Zandford and satisfies\nthe coincides test it sets forth, and for similar reasons. In\nZandford, the SEC brought a civil action against a broker,\nwho, over a period of time, gained control of an investment\naccount, sold its securities, and then pocketed the pro-\nceeds. 535 U. S., at 815\u2013816. The broker argued that \u201cthe\nsales themselves were perfectly lawful and that the sub-\nequent misappropriation of the proceeds, though fraud-\nlent, is not properly viewed as having the requisite\nconnection with the sales.\u201d Id., at 820. The Court rejected\nthat argument. Although the transactions were lawful\nand separate from the misappropriations, the two were\n\u201cnot independent events.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the fraud \u201ccoin-\ncided with the sales,\u201d in part because the sales \u201cfur-\nther[ed]\u201d the fraud. Ibid.\n   The Court likened the broker\u2019s fraud to that in Superin-\ntendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404\nU. S. 6, 10 (1971), where the fraud victims were misled to\nbelieve that they \u201cwould receive the proceeds of the\nsale\u201d of securities. Zandford, 535 U. S., at 821. Like the\nvictims in Bankers Life, the victims in Zandford \u201cwere\ninjured as investors through [the broker]\u2019s deceptions\u201d\nbecause \u201c[t]hey were duped into believing that [the broker]\nwould \u2018conservatively invest\u2019 their assets in the stock\nmarket and that any transactions made on their behalf\nwould be for their benefit.\u201d Id., at 822. Both suffered\nlosses because they were victims of dishonest intermediar-\nies or fiduciaries. See also In re Richard J. Line, 62\nS.E.C. Docket 2879 (1996) (broker who induced parents to\ntransfer funds to him to invest in securities so as to tem-\nporarily hide them during the college financial aid applica-\ntion process, but then failed to return the money, violated\nRule 10b\u20135).\n   Here, just as in Zandford, the victims parted with their\nmoney based on a fraudster\u2019s promise to invest it on their\nbehalf by purchases and sales in the securities markets.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nThe investors had\u2014or were led to believe they could\nhave\u2014the advantages of Stanford\u2019s and SIB\u2019s expertise\nin investments in the national market. So here, as in\nZandford, the success of the fraud turned on the promise\nto trade in regulated securities. According to the com-\nplaints, SIB represented that it would \u201c \u2018re-inves[t]\u2019 \u201d the\nplaintiffs\u2019 money on their behalf in \u201ca well-diversified\nportfolio of highly marketable securities issued by stable\nnational governments, strong multinational companies,\nand major international banks\u201d to ensure a \u201csafe, liquid,\u201d\nand above-market return. See App. 244, 249, 250, 253,\n336, 342, 345, 444, 470, 480, 628. The misrepresentation\nwas about nationally traded securities and lent credence\nto SIB\u2019s promise that the CDs were a liquid investment\nthat \u201ccould be redeemed with just a few days\u2019 notice.\u201d See\nid., at 253, 345, 445, 628. The CDs, SIB explained, would\nbe backed by nationally traded securities. As a result,\naccording to the complaints, the misrepresentation was\n\u201cmaterial.\u201d Id., at 244\u2013245, 336\u2013338, 480, 715. The fraud\ncould not have succeeded without the misrepresentation:\nThe investors gave SIB money because they expected it to\nbe invested in the national securities markets. The con-\nnection between the promised purchases and the misrep-\nresentation is more direct than in Zandford, because the\nmisrepresentation was essential to the fraud.\n   Here, and again just as in Zandford, the fraud was not\ncomplete until the representation about securities transac-\ntions became untrue, just as Stanford intended all along.\nInstead of purchasing covered securities, SIB purchased\nsome but fewer covered securities than it promised\u2014only\n10% of its portfolio, according to an affidavit attached to a\ncomplaint\u2014and primarily speculated in Caribbean real\nestate. Brief for Respondents 37; App. 594; but see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 43\u201344 (suggesting SIB did not purchase securi-\nties). It was not until SIB rendered the CDs illiquid by\nfailing to make substantial investments in the nationally\n10         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntraded securities it promised that the fraud was consum-\nmated. At that point, SIB blocked the plaintiffs\u2019 access to\nthe market. The fraud and SIB\u2019s failure to purchase all\nthat it promised were not independent events. Rather, the\nfalse promises to invest in covered securities enabled and\nfurthered the CD fraud. Without the false promise, there\nwould have been no money to purchase the covered securi-\nties. On these facts, this Court\u2019s controlling precedents\ninstruct that these misrepresentations were made \u201cin con-\nection with the purchase or sale\u201d of regulated securi-\nties; and, as a result, state-law claims concerning them\nshould be precluded.\n   Dabit provides further support for this conclusion.\nThere, the Court held that an investment bank that de-\nceived brokers into advising their clients to hold covered\nsecurities made misrepresentations \u201cin connection with\nthe purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d \u201cUnder our\nprecedents,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cit is enough that the\nfraud alleged \u2018coincide\u2019 with a securities transaction\u2014\nwhether by the plaintiff or by someone else.\u201d 547 U. S., at\n85. It did not matter that the plaintiffs did not purchase\nor sell securities, because they were participants in the\nnational markets: \u201cThe requisite showing, in other words,\u201d\nis \u201c \u2018deception \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of\nany security,\u201d not deception of an identifiable purchaser or\nseller.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S., at 658). Here,\nfor like reasons, it does not matter that the fraud victims,\nas opposed to Stanford and SIB, were not the ones to fail\nto invest in the market. The very essence of the fraud was\nto induce purchase of the CDs on the (false) promise that\ninvestors should rely on SIB\u2019s special skills and expertise\nin making market investments in covered securities on\ntheir behalf. If promises related to covered securities are\nintegral to the fraud in this direct way, federal regula-\ntion is necessary if confidence in the market is to be\nmaintained.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   That interest is at stake here. Because confidence in the\nability to act as an investor without diversion of funds by\nintermediaries and insiders is critical, it does not matter if\nthe victim of a fraud does not purchase or sell a security,\nDabit, supra, at 85; or if the sale or purchase does not\noccur at the same time as the deception, Bankers Life, 404\nU. S., at 12\u201313; or if no party to the actual transaction is\ndeceived by the fraud, O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 656; or if the\nmisrepresentation has nothing to do with the value of a\ncovered security, Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820. An inves-\ntor\u2019s confidence in the market, and willingness to partici-\npate in it, may be severely undermined if frauds like the\none here are not within the reach of federal regulation.\nFrauds like this one undermine investor confidence in\nattorneys, accountants, brokers, and investment advisers,\nthe intermediaries on whom investors depend to gain\naccess to the market. And when frauds are as widespread\nas this one, the market as a whole is weakened because\ninvestors, including sophisticated ones, are misled as to\nthe amount of funds committed to the market and its\nconsequent stability and resilience.\n   The rule that SLUSA applies when a misrepresentation\nabout the market is coincident to the fraud is, then, essen-\ntial to the framework of the Act and to federal securities\nregulation. Fraudulent practices \u201c \u2018constantly vary,\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018practices legitimate for some purposes may be turned to\nillegitimate and fraudulent means.\u2019 \u201d Bankers Life, supra,\nat 12. That is why the key language \u201cshould be construed\nnot technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate\nits remedial purposes.\u201d Zandford, supra, at 819 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see Affiliated Ute, 406 U. S., at\n151. The language merits a \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d be-\ncause it is part of a residuary provision that must be able\nto accommodate evolving methods of fraud by intermediar-\nies and insiders in ever more complicated securities mar-\nkets. Central Bank, 511 U. S., at 174. Its interpretation\n12           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nshould not privilege fraudsters who devise ever more\ndevious methods of committing fraud involving covered\nsecurities.\n   At the same time, the submitted interpretation is not so\nbroad as to \u201cconvert every common-law fraud that hap-\npens to involve securities into a violation of \u00a710(b)\u201d or\npreclude all state tort claims that involve securities in a\ntangential way. Zandford, supra, at 820. So, for example,\nthe statutory language does not extend to cover a thief\nwho steals money from a store to buy securities or to a\nfraudster who defrauds a bank for a loan that he uses to\nbuy securities. See O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 656. The victims\nin those cases are not concerned about their ability to act\nas investors but rather about their duties as a store clerk\nor a loan officer. Those frauds involve securities transac-\ntions only as happenstance. As a result, the interpretation\nsubmitted in this dissent strikes the balance that Con-\ngress intended between forbidding frauds by intermediar-\nies in the market without reaching frauds that touch the\nmarkets in only tangential ways.\n   The key question is whether the misrepresentation\ncoincides with the purchase or sale of a covered security\nor the purchase or sale of the securities is what enables\nthe fraud. Stanford\u2019s misrepresentation did so. Stanford\npromised to purchase covered securities for investors,\nusing his special expertise, thus allowing investors to rely\non his skill to participate in the national securities mar-\nkets. The entire scheme rested on investors falling for the\ntrick. When covered securities are so integral to the fraud,\nthe false promise is incident to the purchase or sale of\nregulated securities because it coincides with it, and the\nmisrepresentation respecting national securities enabled\nthe fraud.\n                              D\n     The Court interprets the phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nomission of a material fact in connection with the pur-\nchase or sale of a covered security\u201d\u2014the key phrase in\nSLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135\u2014in a different manner. The\nresult, it is submitted, is inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme Congress enacted and casts doubt on the applica-\nbility of federal securities law to cases of serious securities\nfraud.\n   The Court construes the text of SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135\nto require a misrepresentation that \u201cis material to a deci-\nsion by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster)\nto buy or sell a \u2018covered security.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8. The Act\nsimply does not say that the purchase or sale\u2014or the\npromise to make a purchase or sale\u2014must be by one other\nthan the fraudster. Rather the Act states that there must\nbe \u201ca misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu-\nrity.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A). See 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135\n(2013) (requiring an \u201cuntrue statement of a material fact\u201d\n\u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d).\nThe Court narrows the statute Congress wrote in two\nways. It excises the important \u201cin connection with\u201d lan-\nguage, resulting in a confined reading inconsistent with\nthe Act\u2019s purpose, structure, and operation. And, by re-\nquiring the purchase or sale be made by someone \u201cother\nthan the fraudster,\u201d the Court inserts a limiting phrase\nthat nowhere appears in the language of the provisions.\nIn litigation like this, this new rule has it upside down.\nWhen the violation that adversely affects the securities\nmarket is done by the fraudster himself, that is all the\nmore reason for applying federal law. This is not a case\nwhere Congress has limited its coverage to a certain sub-\nset of purchasers. Congress enacted such a limit two\nsubsections later in SLUSA when detailing which ac-\ntions are not precluded. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(3)(A)(ii)(I)\n(\u201cthe purchase or sale of securities by the issuer or an\naffiliate of the issuer exclusively from or to holders of\n14          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nequity securities of the issuer\u201d). But it did not do so in the\nprovision at issue.\n   The Court\u2019s reconstruction of the language of the provi-\nsions also casts doubt on the applicability of federal securi-\nties law to three established instances of federal securities\nfraud and one instance of preclusion under the Act as\nadjudged by the Court and the SEC in earlier cases.\n   First, the Court\u2019s interpretation necessarily suggests\nthat Zandford is incorrect and that dishonest brokers need\nnot fear Rule 10b\u20135 liability. The deceit in Zandford was\nthat the broker would act as the victim\u2019s fiduciary when in\nfact he planned on selling (and did sell) the investor\u2019s\nsecurities for his own benefit. 535 U. S., at 820; see also\nLine, 62 S.E.C. Docket 2879 (broker\u2019s deceit was false\npromise to buy). The Court\u2019s rule that liability must rest\non a finding that someone other than the fraudster pur-\nchased or sold securities is inconsistent with Zandford,\nwhere the recipient of the misrepresentation did not buy\nor sell. The Court\u2019s opinion disregards the hazards to the\nmarket when the fraudster is the one acting in the market\nand frustrates the investment objectives of his victims.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s interpretation is difficult to reconcile\nwith liability for insider trading. In O\u2019Hagan, the Court\nheld that the \u201cin connection with\u201d element \u201cis satisfied\nbecause the fiduciary\u2019s fraud is consummated, not when\nthe fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when,\nwithout disclosure to his principal, he uses the infor-\nmation to purchase or sell securities,\u201d \u201ceven though the\nperson or entity defrauded is not the other party to the\ntrade.\u201d 521 U. S., at 656. The Court\u2019s requirement that\nsomeone other than the fraudster purchase or sell a secu-\nrity is hard to square with O\u2019Hagan.\n   Third, the Court\u2019s interpretation is difficult to square\nwith the SEC\u2019s position in In re Orlando Joseph Jett, 82\nS.E.C. Docket 1211 (2004). There, the SEC held liable a\ntrader who fabricated complex trades to supplement the\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nreturns of his real trades, so as to increase his standing\nin his company. The SEC likened Jett to \u201cgarden-variety\nsecurities fraud cases in which a broker-dealer or invest-\nment adviser engages in unsuccessful securities trades for\na client and then hides the losses or inflates the profits by\nsending out false account statements.\u201d Id., at 1253. The\ndecision of the Court today would require that Jett\u2019s mis-\nrepresentation led to the purchase or sale of securities by\nsomeone other than Jett. But the SEC found Jett\u2019s own\npurchases and sales to be sufficient to come within the\nsecurities laws.\n    Finally, the Court\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with the\nunanimous opinion in Dabit, which interpreted the same\nstatutory language at issue in this litigation. Dabit\nsquarely rejected the view that \u201can alleged fraud is \u2018in\nconnection with\u2019 a purchase or sale of securities only when\nthe plaintiff himself was defrauded into purchasing or\nselling particular securities.\u201d 547 U. S., at 85. Instead,\nit approved the SEC\u2019s interpretation that a broker who\n\u201c \u2018sells customer securities with intent to misappropriate\nthe proceeds\u2019 \u201d satisfies the \u201cin connection with the pur-\nchase or sale\u201d requirement. Ibid., n. 10. Dabit cannot be\nreconciled with today\u2019s decision to require someone other\nthan the fraudster buy or sell a security.\n    It is correct that there is no case precisely standing for\nthe proposition that a victim does not have to take an\nownership position. However, O\u2019Hagan supports that\nview. O\u2019Hagan clearly states that in insider trading cases\n\u201cthe person or entity defrauded is not the other party to\nthe trade.\u201d 521 U. S., at 656. And in Zandford a fraudster\ntold customers he would invest \u201ctheir money\u201d in securities\nand then sold those securities. 535 U. S., at 815. Here the\nfraudster told plaintiffs that he would \u201cre-invest\u201d \u201ctheir\u201d\nmoney in securities and then bought different securities.\nApp. 250, 470, 715. The only difference is that there the\nfraudster sold and here he bought. Federal regulation\n16         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nshould not turn on whether a fraudster arrives before or\nafter an investor makes his first purchase.\n                              II\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation also introduces confusion into\nsecurities law by not defining what it means for someone\n\u201cother than the fraudster to buy or sell\u201d a security, a rule\nthat it derives from its view that the precedents all involve\nvictims who had an ownership interest in securities. Ante,\nat 8\u201310. The precedents the Court cites involve what the\nparties have called direct ownership, where the victim\nbuys or sells an entire equity. By using the term owner-\nship interest instead of ownership, the Court also appears\nto accept the respondents\u2019 concession that indirect owner-\nship, where the victim buys or sells shares in a defendant\nfund that itself owns equities, is sufficient in certain cir-\ncumstances, such as when a victim has \u201csome interest in\nthe defendant\u2019s supposed portfolio.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n16.\n   An ownership rule distinguishing between different\ntypes of indirect ownership is unworkable. Indirect own-\nership is a common type of investment. See M. Fink, The\nRise of Mutual Funds 1 (2008) (U. S. mutual funds have\nover 88 million American shareholders and over $11 tril-\nlion in assets). Yet whether indirect ownership involves\nan interest in the underlying equities is a complex ques-\ntion of corporation, LLC, or partnership law. See In re\nBernard L. Madoff Inv. Securities LLC, 708 F. 3d 422, 427\n(CA2 2013). Congress likely did not intend preclusion of\nstate-law suits to depend on the complexities of the Dela-\nware Code.\n   The Court\u2019s ownership approach also casts doubt on the\nscope of Rule 10b\u20135. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation,\n\u00a710(b) applies to fraudulent mutual or hedge funds not\nbecause those funds invest in securities but because in-\nvestments in the funds are securities. But not all such\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ninvestments are securities. 2 L. Ribstein & R. Keatinge,\nLimited Liability Companies \u00a714:2 (2010) (discussing test\nfor a security from SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293\n(1946)); 1 H. Bloomenthal & S. Wolff, Securities Law\nHandbook \u00a7\u00a72:3 to 2:4 (2010). For those that are not, the\nCourt seems to envision liability only when the investment\nconfers an ownership interest in the fund\u2019s securities. And\nthe general rule for investments in funds organized as\nLLPs and LLCs is that they do not convey such claims.\n1 Ribstein & Keatinge, supra, \u00a77:11; see In re Herald, 730\nF. 3d 112 (CA2 2013). As a result, in important instances\nRule 10b\u20135 may not extend to mutual and hedge funds\nunder the Court\u2019s interpretation.\n  It is true that the SEC pursued the fraudster with suc-\ncess here. But that is because the CDs are securities. See\nOrder Denying Motion to Dismiss in SEC v. Stanford\nInternational Bank, No. 3\u201309\u2013CV\u20130298\u2013N (ND Tex., Nov.\n30, 2011), pp. 5\u201310. This aspect of Stanford\u2019s fraud is not\na necessary feature of all frauds involving funds similar\nto SIB.\n                             III\n  The fraudster in this litigation misrepresented that he\nwould purchase nationally traded securities. That mis-\nrepresentation was made \u201cin connection with the purchase\nor sale\u201d of the promised securities because it coincided\nwith them. The fraud turned on the misrepresentation.\nThe Court\u2019s contrary interpretation excises the phrase \u201cin\nconnection with\u201d from the Act, a phrase that the Court in\nearlier cases held to require a broad and flexible meaning.\nAt the same time, by holding that the purchase or sale of\nsecurities be made by someone other than the fraudster,\nthe Court engrafts a limitation that does not appear in the\ntext. The result is to constrict the application of federal\nsecurities regulation in instances where dishonest brokers,\ninsider traders, and lying employees purchase or sell\n18         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsecurities, or promise to do so, as part of the fraud. To-\nday\u2019s decision introduces confusion in the enforcement of\nsecurities laws.\n  For these reasons, it is submitted that the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n",

The Act defines \u201ccovered security\u201d to include, as relevant\n  here, only securities traded on a national exchange. \u00a7\u00a778bb(f)(5)(E),\n  77r(b)(1).\n     Four sets of plaintiffs, respondents here, filed civil class actions\n  under state law, contending that the defendants, petitioners here,\n  helped Allen Stanford and his companies perpetrate a Ponzi scheme\n  by falsely representing that uncovered securities (certificates of de-\n  posit in Stanford International Bank) that plaintiffs were purchasing\n  were backed by covered securities. The District Court dismissed each\n  case under the Litigation Act. Although the certificates of deposit\n  were not covered securities, the court concluded, the Bank\u2019s misrep-\n  resentation that its holdings in covered securities made investments\n  in its uncovered securities more secure provided the requisite \u201ccon-\n  nection\u201d (under the Litigation Act) between the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law\n  actions and transactions in covered securities. The Fifth Circuit re-\n  versed, concluding that the falsehoods about the Bank\u2019s holdings in\n  covered securities were too tangentially related to the fraud to trigger\n  the Litigation Act.\nHeld: The Litigation Act does not preclude the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law class\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   * Together with No. 12\u201386, Willis of Colorado Inc. et al. v. Troice\net al., and No. 12\u201388, Proskauer Rose LLP v. Troice et al., also on certio-\nrari to the same court.\n2               CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    actions. Pp. 8\u201319.\n       (a) Several factors support the conclusion that the scope of\n    \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A)\u2019s phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material\n    fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security\u201d\n    does not extend further than misrepresentations that are material to\n    the decision by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster) to\n    purchase or sell a covered security. First, this interpretation is con-\n    sistent with the Act\u2019s basic focus on transactions in covered, not un-\n    covered, securities. Second, the interpretation is supported by the\n    Act\u2019s language. The phrase \u201cmaterial fact in connection with the\n    purchase or sale\u201d suggests a connection that matters. And a connec-\n    tion matters where the misrepresentation makes a significant differ-\n    ence to someone\u2019s decision to purchase or to sell a covered security,\n    not an uncovered one, something about which the Act expresses no\n    concern. See Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S. ___,\n    ___. Further, for the connection to matter, the \u201csomeone\u201d making the\n    decision to purchase or sell a covered security must be a party other\n    than the fraudster. Third, the securities cases in which this Court\n    has found a fraud to be \u201cin connection with\u201d a purchase or sale of a\n    security, under both the Litigation Act and Section 10(b) of the Secu-\n    rities Exchange Act of 1934 (which also uses the \u201cin connection with\u201d\n    phrase), have involved victims who took, who tried to take, who di-\n    vested themselves of, who tried to divest themselves of, or who main-\n    tained an ownership interest in financial instruments that fall within\n    the relevant statutory definition. See, e.g., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,\n    Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 77. Fourth, this Court\n    reads the Litigation Act in light of and consistent with the language\n    and purpose of the underlying regulatory statutes, the Securities Ex-\n    change Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933, which refer to per-\n    sons engaged in securities transactions that lead to the taking or dis-\n    solving of ownership positions, and which make it illegal to deceive a\n    person when he or she is doing so. The basic purpose of the 1934 and\n    1933 regulatory statutes is to protect investor confidence in the secu-\n    rities markets. Nothing in those statutes, or in the Litigation Act,\n    suggests their object is to protect persons whose connection with the\n    statutorily defined securities is more remote than buying or selling.\n    Fifth, a broader interpretation of the necessary statutory \u201cconnec-\n    tion\u201d would interfere with state efforts to provide remedies for vic-\n    tims of ordinary state-law frauds, despite the fact that the Litigation\n    Act purposefully seeks to avoid such results by maintaining States\u2019\n    legal authority over matters that are primarily of state concern, see,\n    e.g., \u00a7\u00a778bb(f)(4). Pp. 9\u201314.\n       (b) Respondents and the Government make two important, but un-\n    availing, counterarguments. First, they point to this Court\u2019s sugges-\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  tions that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d should be given a broad in-\n  terpretation. But every case in which this Court interpreted the\n  phrase to cover a fraud involved a false statement (or the like) that\n  was \u201cmaterial\u201d to another individual\u2019s decision to \u201cpurchase or s[ell]\u201d\n  a statutorily defined \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201ccovered security,\u201d e.g., Dabit, su-\n  pra, at 75\u201377, and where the transaction was by or on behalf of\n  someone other than the fraudster. Second, the Government warns\n  that a narrow interpretation would curtail the Securities and Ex-\n  change Commission\u2019s enforcement powers under \u00a710(b) of the Securi-\n  ties Exchange Act, which uses the same \u201cin connection with the pur-\n  chase or sale\u201d phrase. To the contrary, this Court\u2019s interpretation is\n  perfectly consistent with past SEC practice. The authority of the\n  SEC and the Department of Justice extends to all \u201csecurities\u201d under\n  \u00a710(b), not just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U. S. C.\n  \u00a778c(a)(10). The SEC has accordingly brought successful enforce-\n  ment actions against Stanford and his associates, based on the\n  Bank\u2019s fraudulent sales of certificates of deposit\u2014products that are\n  \u201csecurities\u201d even if not \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Neither the Government\n  nor the dissent has pointed to an example of any prior SEC enforce-\n  ment action that the instant holding would have prevented the SEC\n  from bringing. Pp. 14\u201317.\n     (c) Respondents\u2019 complaints do not allege, for Litigation Act pur-\n  poses, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \u201cin connection\n  with\u201d the \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d At most, they al-\n  lege misrepresentations about the Bank\u2019s ownership of covered secu-\n  rities. But the Bank is the fraudster, not the fraudster\u2019s victim; nor\n  is it some other person transacting in covered securities. Thus, there\n  is not the necessary \u201cconnection\u201d between the materiality of the mis-\n  statements and the statutorily required \u201cpurchase or sale of a cov-\n  ered security.\u201d In addition, while the District Court found that one\n  plaintiff acquired Bank certificates with proceeds from the sale of\n  covered securities, the plaintiffs did not allege that the sale of these\n  covered securities constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme or\n  that Stanford or his associates were interested in how the plaintiffs\n  obtained the funds to purchase the certificates. Thus, those sales\n  were only incidental to the fraud. Pp. 17\u201319.\n675 F. 3d 503, affirmed.\n\n   BREYER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

It says that plaintiffs may\nnot maintain a class action \u201cbased upon the statutory or\ncommon law of any State\u201d in which the plaintiffs allege \u201ca\nmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact in con-\nnection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d 15\nU. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1) (emphasis added). The Act defines\n2           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\n\u201cclass actions\u201d as those involving more than 50 members.\nSee \u00a778bb(f)(5). It defines \u201ccovered security\u201d narrowly to\ninclude only securities traded on a national exchange (or,\nhere irrelevant, those issued by investment companies).\n\u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(5)(E), 77r(b)(1)\u2013(2).\n   The question before us is whether the Litigation Act\nencompasses a class action in which the plaintiffs allege\n(1) that they \u201cpurchase[d]\u201d uncovered securities (certifi\u00ad\ncates of deposit that are not traded on any national ex\u00ad\nchange), but (2) that the defendants falsely told the victims\nthat the uncovered securities were backed by covered\nsecurities. We note that the plaintiffs do not allege that\nthe defendants\u2019 misrepresentations led anyone to buy or to\nsell (or to maintain positions in) covered securities. Under\nthese circumstances, we conclude the Act does not apply.\n   In light of the dissent\u2019s characterization of our holding,\npost, at 11\u201312 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.)\u2014which we believe\nis incorrect\u2014we specify at the outset that this holding\ndoes not limit the Federal Government\u2019s authority to\nprosecute \u201cfrauds like the one here.\u201d Post, at 11. The\nFederal Government has in fact brought successful prose\u00ad\ncutions against the fraudsters at the heart of this litiga\u00ad\ntion, see infra, at 5\u20136, and we fail to understand the\ndissent\u2019s repeated suggestions to the contrary, post, at 3, 4,\n11, 12, 17. Rather, as we shall explain, we believe the\nbasic consequence of our holding is that, without limiting\nthe Federal Government\u2019s prosecution power in any sig-\nnificant way, it will permit victims of this (and similar)\nfrauds to recover damages under state law. See infra, at\n15\u201317. Under the dissent\u2019s approach, they would have no\nsuch ability.\n                              I\n\n                              A\n\n    The relevant statutory framework has four parts:\n\n    (1) Section 10(b) of the underlying regulatory\n                   Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)               3\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nstatute, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 48 Stat.\n891, as amended, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778j (2012 ed.). This well\u00ad\nknown statutory provision forbids the \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cem\u00ad\nploy[ment]\u201d of \u201cany manipulative or deceptive device or\ncontrivance\u201d \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of\nany security.\u201d \u00a778j(b).\n   Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b\u20135 simi\u00ad\nlarly forbids the use of any \u201cdevice, scheme, or artifice to\ndefraud\u201d (including the making of \u201cany untrue statement\nof a material fact\u201d or any similar \u201comi[ssion]\u201d) \u201cin connec\u00ad\ntion with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 17 CFR\n\u00a7240.10b\u20135 (2013).\n   For purposes of these provisions, the Securities Ex\u00ad\nchange Act defines \u201csecurity\u201d broadly to include not just\nthings traded on national exchanges, but also \u201cany note,\nstock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap,\nbond, debenture . . . [or] certificate of deposit for a security.\u201d\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778c(a)(10). See also \u00a7\u00a777b(a)(1), 80a\u20132(a)\n(36), 80b\u20132(a)(18) (providing virtually identical defini-\ntions of \u201csecurity\u201d for the Securities Act of 1933, the In\u00ad\nvestment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940).\n   (2) A statute-based private right of action. The\nCourt has read \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135 as providing injured\npersons with a private right of action to sue for damages\nsuffered through those provisions\u2019 violation. See, e.g., Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723, 730\n(1975).\n   The scope of the private right of action is more limited\nthan the scope of the statutes upon which it is based. See\nStoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta,\nInc., 552 U. S. 148, 153, 155, 166 (2008) (private right does\nnot cover suits against \u201csecondary actors\u201d who had no \u201crole\nin preparing or disseminating\u201d a stock issuer\u2019s fraudulent\n\u201cfinancial statements\u201d); Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v.\nFirst Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 179\n4          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n(1994) (private right does not extend to actions against\n\u201caiders and abettors\u201d of securities fraud); Blue Chip\nStamps, supra, at 737 (private right extends only to pur\u00ad\nchasers and sellers, not to holders, of securities).\n   (3) The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995 (PSLRA). 109 Stat. 737, 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a777z\u20131,\n78u\u20134. This law imposes procedural and substantive\nlimitations upon the scope of the private right of action\navailable under \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135. It requires plain\u00ad\ntiffs to meet heightened pleading standards. It permits\ndefendants to obtain automatic stays of discovery. It\nlimits recoverable damages and attorney\u2019s fees. And it\ncreates a new \u201csafe harbor\u201d for forward-looking state\u00ad\nments. See \u00a7\u00a778u\u20134, 78u\u20135.\n   (4) The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards\nAct. 112 Stat. 3227, 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f )(1)(A). As we said\nat the outset, this 1998 law forbids any\n    \u201ccovered class action based upon the statutory or\n    common law of any State . . . by any private party\n    alleging\u2014\n    \u201c(A) a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact\n    in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered\n    security; or\n    \u201c(B) that the defendant used or employed any manipu\u00ad\n    lative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection\n    with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d\n    \u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(1)(A)\u2013(B).\nThe law defines \u201ccovered security\u201d narrowly. It is a secu\u00ad\nrity that \u201csatisfies the standards for a covered security\nspecified in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 18(b) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(E). And the relevant\nparagraphs of \u00a718(b) of the 1933 Act define a \u201ccovered\nsecurity\u201d as \u201c[a security] listed, or authorized for listing,\non a national securities exchange,\u201d \u00a777r(b)(1) (or, though\nnot relevant here, as a security issued by an \u201cinvestment\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\ncompany,\u201d \u00a777r(b)(2)). The Litigation Act also specifies\nthat a \u201ccovered security\u201d must be listed or authorized for\nlisting on a national exchange \u201cat the time during which it\nis alleged that the misrepresentation, omission, or manip\u00ad\nulative or deceptive conduct occurred.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(E).\n   The Litigation Act sets forth exceptions. It does not\napply to class actions with fewer than 51 \u201cpersons or\nprospective class members.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(5)(B). It does not\napply to actions brought on behalf of a State itself.\n\u00a778bb(f )(3)(B)(i). It does not apply to class actions based\non the law \u201cof the State in which the issuer is incorpo\u00ad\nrated.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(3)(A)(i). And it reserves the authority of\nstate securities commissions \u201cto investigate and bring\nenforcement actions.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(4).\n   We are here primarily interested in the Litigation Act\u2019s\nphrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact\nin connection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu\u00ad\nrity.\u201d \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A). Unless this phrase applies to the class\nactions before us, the plaintiffs may maintain their state\u00ad\nlaw-based class actions, and they may do so either in\nfederal or state court. Otherwise, their class actions are\nprecluded altogether. See \u00a778bb(f )(2) (providing for the\nremoval from state to federal court of class actions that\nmeet the specifications of paragraph 1, and for the dismis\u00ad\nsal of such suits by the district court).\n                            B\n                            1\n  The plaintiffs in these actions (respondents here) say\nthat Allen Stanford and several of his companies ran a\nmultibillion dollar Ponzi scheme. Essentially, Stanford\nand his companies sold the plaintiffs certificates of deposit\nin Stanford International Bank. Those certificates \u201cwere\ndebt assets that promised a fixed rate of return.\u201d Roland\nv. Green, 675 F. 3d 503, 522 (CA5 2012). The plaintiffs\nexpected that Stanford International Bank would use the\n6          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmoney it received to buy highly lucrative assets. But\ninstead, Stanford and his associates used the money pro\u00ad\nvided by new investors to repay old investors, to finance\nan elaborate lifestyle, and to finance speculative real\nestate ventures.\n   The Department of Justice brought related criminal\ncharges against Allen Stanford. A jury convicted Stanford\nof mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money\nlaundering, and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange\nCommission investigation. Stanford was sentenced to\nprison and required to forfeit $6 billion. The SEC, noting\nthat the Bank certificates of deposit fell within the 1934\nSecurities Exchange Act\u2019s broad definition of \u201csecurity,\u201d\nfiled a \u00a710(b) civil case against Allen Stanford, the Stan\u00ad\nford International Bank, and related Stanford companies\nand associates. The SEC won the civil action, and the\ncourt imposed a civil penalty of $6 billion.\n                             2\n  The plaintiffs in each of the four civil class actions are\nprivate investors who bought the Bank\u2019s certificates of\ndeposit. Two groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in\nLouisiana state court against firms and individuals who\nhelped sell the Bank\u2019s certificates by working as \u201cinvest\u00ad\nment advisers\u201d affiliated with Stanford, or who provided\nStanford-related companies with trust, insurance, ac\u00ad\ncounting, or reporting services. (The defendants included\na respondent here, SEI Investments Company.) The\nplaintiffs claimed that the defendants helped the Bank\nperpetrate the fraud, thereby violating Louisiana state\nlaw.\n  Two other groups of plaintiffs filed their actions in\nfederal court for the Northern District of Texas. One\ngroup sued Willis of Colorado (and related Willis compa\u00ad\nnies) and Bowen, Miclette & Britt, two insurance brokers;\nthe other group sued Proskauer Rose and Chadbourne &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nParke, two law firms. Both groups claimed that the de\u00ad\nfendants helped the Bank (and Allen Stanford) perpetrate\nthe fraud or conceal it from regulators, thereby violating\nTexas securities law.\n    The Louisiana state-court defendants removed their\ncases to federal court, and the Judicial Panel on Multi-\nDistrict Litigation moved the Louisiana cases to the\nNorthern District of Texas. A single federal judge heard\nall four class actions.\n    The defendants in each of the cases moved to dismiss\nthe complaints. The District Court concluded that the\nLitigation Act required dismissal. The court recognized\nthat the certificates of deposit themselves were not \u201ccov\u00ad\nered securities\u201d under the Litigation Act, for they were not\n\u201c \u2018traded nationally [or] listed on a regulated national\nexchange.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 12\u201386, p. 62.\nBut each complaint in one way or another alleged that\nthe fraud included misrepresentations that the Bank\nmaintained significant holdings in \u201c \u2018highly marketable se-\ncurities issued by stable governments [and] strong mul-\ntinational companies,\u2019 \u201d and that the Bank\u2019s ownership of\nthese \u201ccovered\u201d securities made investments in the uncovered\ncertificates more secure. Id., at 66. The court concluded\nthat this circumstance provided the requisite statutory\n\u201cconnection\u201d between (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law fraud\nclaims, and (2) \u201ctransactions in covered securities.\u201d Id., at\n64, 66\u201367. Hence, the court dismissed the class actions\nunder the Litigation Act. Id., at 75. See also 675 F. 3d,\nat 511.\n    All four sets of plaintiffs appealed. The Fifth Circuit\nreversed. It agreed with the District Court that the com\u00ad\nplaints described misrepresentations about the Bank\u2019s\ninvestments in nationally traded securities. Still, the\n\u201cheart, crux, and gravamen of \u201d the \u201callegedly fraudulent\nscheme was representing . . . that the [uncovered] CDs\nwere a \u2018safe and secure\u2019 investment that was preferable to\n8           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nother investments for many reasons.\u201d Id., at 522. The\ncourt held that the falsehoods about the Bank\u2019s holdings\nin covered securities were too \u201c \u2018tangentially related\u2019 \u201d to\nthe \u201ccrux\u201d of the fraud to trigger the Litigation Act. Id., at\n520, 522 (quoting Madden v. Cowen & Co., 576 F. 3d 957,\n965\u2013966 (CA9 2009)). \u201cThat the CDs were marketed with\nsome vague references to [the Bank\u2019s] portfolio containing\ninstruments that might be [covered by the Litigation Act]\nseems tangential to the schemes,\u201d to the point where the\ncomplaints fall outside the scope of that Act. 675 F. 3d,\nat 522.\n  Defendants in the four class actions sought certiorari.\nWe granted their petitions.\n                               II\n   The question before us concerns the scope of the Litiga\u00ad\ntion Act\u2019s phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a\nmaterial fact in connection with the purchase or sale of\na covered security.\u201d \u00a778bb(f )(1)(A). How broad is that\nscope? Does it extend further than misrepresentations\nthat are material to the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity?\n   In our view, the scope of this language does not extend\nfurther. To put the matter more specifically: A fraudulent\nmisrepresentation or omission is not made \u201cin connection\nwith\u201d such a \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security\u201d un\u00ad\nless it is material to a decision by one or more individuals\n(other than the fraudster) to buy or to sell a \u201ccovered\nsecurity.\u201d We add that in Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &\nSmith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71 (2006), we held that the\nLitigation Act precluded a suit where the plaintiffs alleged\na \u201cfraudulent manipulation of stock prices\u201d that was mate\u00ad\nrial to and \u201c \u2018concide[d]\u2019 with\u201d third-party securities trans\u00ad\nactions, while also inducing the plaintiffs to \u201chold their\nstocks long beyond the point when, had the truth been\nknown, they would have sold.\u201d Id., at 75, 85, 89 (citing\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nUnited States v. O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 651 (1997)). We\ndo not here modify Dabit.\n                                 A\n   We reach this interpretation of the Litigation Act for\nseveral reasons. First, the Act focuses upon transactions\nin covered securities, not upon transactions in uncovered\nsecurities. An interpretation that insists upon a material\nconnection with a transaction in a covered security is\nconsistent with the Act\u2019s basic focus.\n   Second, a natural reading of the Act\u2019s language supports\nour interpretation. The language requires the dismissal of\na state-law-based class action where a private party alleges\na \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a material fact\u201d (or\nengages in other forms of deception, not relevant here) \u201cin\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu\u00ad\nrity.\u201d \u00a778bb(f)(1). The phrase \u201cmaterial fact in connection\nwith the purchase or sale\u201d suggests a connection that\nmatters. And for present purposes, a connection matters\nwhere the misrepresentation makes a significant differ\u00ad\nence to someone\u2019s decision to purchase or to sell a covered\nsecurity, not to purchase or to sell an uncovered security,\nsomething about which the Act expresses no concern. See\ngenerally Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U. S.\n___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9\u201312) (a misrepresentation or\nomission is \u201cmaterial\u201d if a reasonable investor would have\nconsidered the information significant when contemplat\u00ad\ning a statutorily relevant investment decision). Further,\nthe \u201csomeone\u201d making that decision to purchase or sell\nmust be a party other than the fraudster. If the only party\nwho decides to buy or sell a covered security as a result of\na lie is the liar, that is not a \u201cconnection\u201d that matters.\n   Third, prior case law supports our interpretation. As far\nas we are aware, every securities case in which this Court\nhas found a fraud to be \u201cin connection with\u201d a purchase or\nsale of a security has involved victims who took, who tried\n10         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nto take, who divested themselves of, who tried to divest\nthemselves of, or who maintained an ownership interest in\nfinancial instruments that fall within the relevant statu\u00ad\ntory definition. See, e.g., Dabit, supra, at 77 (Litigation\nAct: victims were \u201cholders\u201d of covered securities that the\ndefendant\u2019s fraud caused to become overvalued); SEC v.\nZandford, 535 U. S. 813, 822 (2002) (\u00a710(b): victims were\n\u201cduped into believing\u201d that the defendant would \u201c \u2018invest\u2019\ntheir assets in the stock market\u201d); Wharf (Holdings) Ltd.\nv. United Int\u2019l Holdings, Inc., 532 U. S. 588, 592 (2001)\n(\u00a710(b): victim purchased an oral option to buy 10% of a\ncompany\u2019s stock); O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 655\u2013656 (\u00a710(b):\nvictims were \u201cmembers of the investing public\u201d harmed by\nthe defendant\u2019s \u201cgain[ing of an] advantageous market\nposition\u201d through insider trading); Superintendent of Ins.\nof N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U. S. 6, 10\n(1971) (\u00a710(b): victim was \u201cinjured as an investor\u201d when\nthe fraud deprived it of \u201ccompensation for the sale of its\nvaluable block of securities\u201d). We have found no Court\ncase involving a fraud \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase or\nsale of a statutorily defined security in which the victims\ndid not fit one of these descriptions. And the dissent\napparently has not either.\n   Although the dissent characterizes our approach as\n\u201cnew,\u201d post, at 3, and tries to describe several of our prior\ncases, such as Zanford or Dabit, in a different way, post, at\n14\u201315, it cannot escape the fact that every case it cites\ninvolved a victim who took, tried to take, or maintained an\nownership position in the statutorily relevant securities\nthrough \u201cpurchases\u201d or \u201csales\u201d induced by the fraud. E.g.,\nZandford, supra, at 815, 820 (fraudster told customers\nhe would \u201c \u2018conservatively invest\u2019 their money\u201d in the stock\nmarket and made sales of \u201chis customer\u2019s securities,\u201d\nbut pocketed the proceeds (emphasis added)); Dabit, supra,\nat 76, 85, 89 (the \u201cmisrepresentations and manipulative\ntactics caused [the plaintiffs] to hold onto overvalued\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsecurities\u201d while also inducing third parties to trade\nthem); In re Orlando Joseph Jett, 82 S. E. C. Docket 1211,\n1236\u20131237 (2004) (trader\u2019s scheme \u201cgreatly inflated the\nreporting trading profits\u201d that his firm \u201cused to determine\n. . . the amount of capital he was permitted to commit on\nthe firm\u2019s behalf \u201d (emphasis added)).\n   Fourth, we read the Litigation Act in light of and con\u00ad\nsistent with the underlying regulatory statutes, the Secu\u00ad\nrities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.\nThe regulatory statutes refer to persons engaged in securi\u00ad\nties transactions that lead to the taking or dissolving of\nownership positions. And they make it illegal to deceive a\nperson when he or she is doing so. Section 5 of the 1933\nAct, for example, makes it unlawful to \u201coffer to sell or offer\nto buy . . . any security, unless a registration statement\nhas been filed as to such security.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a777e(c).\nSection 17 of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful \u201cin the offer\nor sale of any securities . . . to employ any device, scheme,\nor artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property\nby means of any untrue statement of a material fact.\u201d\n\u00a7\u00a777q(a)(1)\u2013(2). And \u00a710(b) of the 1934 Act makes it\nunlawful to \u201cuse or employ, in connection with the pur\u00ad\nchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or de-\nceptive device or contrivance.\u201d \u00a778j(b).\n   Not only language but also purpose suggests a statutory\nfocus upon transactions involving the statutorily relevant\nsecurities. The basic purpose of the 1934 and 1933 regula\u00ad\ntory statutes is \u201cto insure honest securities markets and\nthereby promote investor confidence.\u201d See O\u2019Hagan, su-\npra, at 658. Nothing in the regulatory statutes suggests\ntheir object is to protect persons whose connection with\nthe statutorily defined securities is more remote than\nwords such as \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201csell,\u201d and the like, indicate. Nor\ndoes anything in the Litigation Act provide us with rea\u00ad\nsons for interpreting its similar language more broadly.\n   The dissent correctly points out that the federal securi\u00ad\n12         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nties laws have another purpose, beyond protecting inves\u00ad\ntors. Namely, they also seek to protect securities issuers,\nas well as the investment advisers, accountants, and\nbrokers who help them sell financial products, from abu\u00ad\nsive class-action lawsuits. Post, at 5. Both the PSLRA\nand the Litigation Act were enacted in service of that goal.\nBy imposing heightened pleading standards, limiting\ndamages, and pre-empting state-law suits where the\nclaims pertained to covered securities, Congress sought to\nreduce frivolous suits and mitigate legal costs for firms\nand investment professionals that participate in the mar\u00ad\nket for nationally traded securities.\n   We fail to see, however, how our decision today under\u00ad\nmines that objective. The dissent worries our approach\nwill \u201csubject many persons and entities whose profession it\nis to give advice, counsel, and assistance in investing in\nthe securities markets to complex and costly state-law\nlitigation.\u201d Post, at 4. To the contrary, the only issuers,\ninvestment advisers, or accountants that today\u2019s decision\nwill continue to subject to state-law liability are those who\ndo not sell or participate in selling securities traded on\nU. S. national exchanges. We concede that this means a\nbank, chartered in Antigua and whose sole product is a\nfixed-rate debt instrument not traded on a U. S. exchange,\nwill not be able to claim the benefit of preclusion under the\nLitigation Act. But it is difficult to see why the federal\nsecurities laws would be\u2014or should be\u2014concerned with\nshielding such entities from lawsuits.\n   Fifth, to interpret the necessary statutory \u201cconnection\u201d\nmore broadly than we do here would interfere with state\nefforts to provide remedies for victims of ordinary state\u00ad\nlaw frauds. A broader interpretation would allow the\nLitigation Act to cover, and thereby to prohibit, a lawsuit\nbrought by creditors of a small business that falsely repre\u00ad\nsented it was creditworthy, in part because it owns or\nintends to own exchange-traded stock. It could prohibit a\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Its proposed rule is that\nwhenever \u201cthe purchase or sale of the securities [including\nby the fraudster] is what enables the fraud,\u201d the Litigation\nAct pre-empts the suit. Post, at 12. In other words, any\ntime one person convinces another to loan him money, by\npretending he owns nationally traded securities or will\nacquire them for himself in the future, the action consti\u00ad\ntutes federal securities fraud, is subject to federal en\u00ad\nforcement, and is also precluded by the Litigation Act if it\nqualifies as a \u201ccovered class action\u201d under \u00a778bb(f )(5)(B)\n(e.g., involves more than 50 members). Leaving aside\nwhether this would work a significant expansion of the\nscope of liability under the federal securities laws, it un\u00ad\nquestionably would limit the scope of protection under\nstate laws that seek to provide remedies to victims of\ngarden-variety fraud.\n   The text of the Litigation Act reflects congressional care\nto avoid such results. Under numerous provisions, it\npurposefully maintains state legal authority, especially\nover matters that are primarily of state concern. See\n\u00a7\u00a778bb(f )(1)(A)\u2013(B) (limiting preclusion to lawsuits in-\nvolving \u201ccovered,\u201d i.e., nationally traded, securities);\n\u00a778bb(f )(4) (providing that the \u201csecurities commission . . .\nof any State shall retain jurisdiction under the laws of\nsuch State to investigate and bring enforcement actions\u201d);\n\u00a778bb(f )(3)(B) (preserving States\u2019 authority to bring suits\nof the kind forbidden to private class-action plaintiffs).\nSee also 112 Stat. 3227 (\u201cCongress finds that . . . it is\nappropriate to enact national standards for securities class\naction lawsuits involving nationally traded securities,\n14          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nwhile preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of\nState securities regulators\u201d). A broad interpretation of the\nLitigation Act works at cross-purposes with this state\u00ad\noriented concern. Cf. Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820 (warning\nagainst \u201cconstru[ing]\u201d the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d \u201cso\nbroadly as to convert any common-law fraud that happens\nto involve securities into a violation of \u00a710(b)\u201d); Wharf\n(Holdings) Ltd., 532 U. S., at 596 (recognizing that \u201cordi\u00ad\nnary state breach-of-contract claims\u201d are \u201cactions that lie\noutside the [Securities Exchange] Act\u2019s basic objectives\u201d).\n                                 B\n   Respondents and the Government make two important\ncounterarguments. Respondents point to statements we\nhave made suggesting we should give the phrase \u201cin con\u00ad\nnection with\u201d a broad interpretation. In Dabit, for exam\u00ad\nple, we said that the Court has consistently \u201cespoused a\nbroad interpretation\u201d of \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context\nof \u00a710(b) and Rule 10b\u20135, and we added that the Litiga\u00ad\ntion Act language similarly warranted a \u201cbroad construc\u00ad\ntion.\u201d 547 U. S., at 85\u201386. In Bankers Life, we said that,\nif a deceptive practice \u201ctouch[es]\u201d a securities transaction,\nit meets \u00a710(b)\u2019s \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, 404\nU. S., at 12, and in O\u2019Hagan, we said the fraud and the\npurchase or sale of a security must simply \u201ccoincide.\u201d 521\nU. S., at 656. The idea, we explained in Zandford, is that\nthe phrase \u201cshould be \u2018construed not technically and re\u00ad\nstrictively, but flexibly to effectuate its remedial purposes.\u2019 \u201d\n535 U. S., at 819 (quoting Affiliated Ute Citizens of\nUtah v. United States, 406 U. S. 128, 151 (1972)).\n   Every one of these cases, however, concerned a false\nstatement (or the like) that was \u201cmaterial\u201d to another\nindividual\u2019s decision to \u201cpurchase or s[ell]\u201d a statutorily\ndefined \u201csecurity\u201d or \u201ccovered security.\u201d Dabit, supra, at\n75\u201377; Zandford, supra, at 822; Wharf (Holdings) Ltd.,\nsupra, at 590\u2013592; O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 655\u2013657; Bankers\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

And the relevant statements or omis\u00ad\nsions were material to a transaction in the relevant securi\u00ad\nties by or on behalf of someone other than the fraudster.\n   Second, the Government points out that \u00a710(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act also uses the phrase \u201cin connec\u00ad\ntion with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778j(b). And the Government warns that a narrow inter\u00ad\npretation of \u201cin connection with\u201d here threatens a simi-\nlarly narrow interpretation there, which could limit the\nSEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 28.\n   We do not understand, however, how our interpretation\ncould significantly curtail the SEC\u2019s enforcement powers.\nAs far as the Government has explained the matter, our\ninterpretation seems perfectly consistent with past SEC\npractice. For one thing, we have cast no doubt on the\nSEC\u2019s ability to bring enforcement actions against Stan\u00ad\nford and Stanford International Bank. The SEC has\nalready done so successfully. As we have repeatedly\npointed out, the term \u201csecurity\u201d under \u00a710(b) covers a wide\nrange of financial products beyond those traded on national\nexchanges, apparently including the Bank\u2019s certificates\nof deposit at issue in these cases. No one here denies that,\nfor \u00a710(b) purposes, the \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentations by\nStanford and his associates were made \u201cin connection\nwith\u201d the \u201cpurchases\u201d of those certificates.\n   We find it surprising that the dissent worries that our\ndecision will \u201cnarro[w] and constric[t] essential protection\nfor our national securities market,\u201d post, at 3, and put\n\u201cfrauds like the one here . . . not within the reach of fed-\neral regulation,\u201d post, at 11. That would be news to Allen\nStanford, who was sentenced to 110 years in federal prison\nafter a successful federal prosecution, and to Stanford\nInternational Bank, which was ordered to pay billions in\nfederal fines, after the same. Frauds like the one here\u2014\nincluding this fraud itself\u2014will continue to be within the\n16         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nreach of federal regulation because the authority of the\nSEC and Department of Justice extends to all \u201csecurities,\u201d\nnot just to those traded on national exchanges. 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778c(a)(10); accord, \u00a777b(a)(1), \u00a780a\u20132(a)(36), \u00a780b\u2013\n2(a)(18). When the fraudster peddles an uncovered secu-\nrity like the CDs here, the Federal Government will have\nthe full scope of its usual powers to act. The only differ\u00ad\nence between our approach and that of the dissent, is that\nwe also preserve the ability for investors to obtain relief\nunder state laws when the fraud bears so remote a connec\u00ad\ntion to the national securities market that no person\nactually believed he was taking an ownership position in\nthat market.\n   Thus, despite the Government\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s hand\nwringing, neither has been able to point to an example of\nany prior SEC enforcement action brought during the past\n80 years that our holding today would have prevented the\nSEC from bringing. At oral argument, the Government\nreferred to an administrative proceeding, In re Richard\nLine, 62 S. E. C. Docket 2879 (1996), as its best example.\nOur examination of the report of that case, however, indi\u00ad\ncates that the defendant was a fraudster to whom the\nfraud\u2019s victims had loaned money, expecting that he would\npurchase securities on their behalf. Id., at 2880 (\u201cLine\nrepresented to investors that he would invest their non\u00ad\nadmitted assets in various securities, including U. S.\nTreasury notes, mutual fund shares, and collateralized\ndebt obligations\u201d); ibid. (\u201c[He] fabricated account state\u00ad\nments which falsely recited that securities had been\npurchased on behalf of certain investors\u201d).\n   The Government\u2019s brief refers to two other proceedings\nas demonstrating the SEC\u2019s broad \u00a710(b) enforcement\npowers. Each, however, involved defrauded investors who\nhad tried to take an ownership interest in the relevant\nsecurities. Jett, 82 S. E. C. Docket, at 1251 (involving a\n\u00a710(b) action where a defrauded trading firm\u2019s \u201cdecision to\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

Post, at 4, 5. The dissent cannot point to one\nexample of a federal securities action\u2014public or private\u2014\nthat would have been permissible in the past but that our\napproach will disallow in the future. And the irony of the\ndissent\u2019s position is that federal law would have precluded\nprivate recovery in these very suits, because \u00a710(b) does\nnot create a private right of action for investors vis-\u00e0-vis\n\u201csecondary actors\u201d or \u201caiders and abettors\u201d of securities\nfraud.

They claimed Stanford \u201ctouted the high quality of\nSIB\u2019s investment portfolio,\u201d and such falsehoods were\nmaterial to their decision to purchase the uncovered certif\u00ad\nicates. Id., at 444.\n   (2) The second set of Texas plaintiffs contended that\nthey, too, purchased the Bank\u2019s certificates on the belief\n\u201cthat their money was being invested in safe, liquid in\u00ad\nvestments.\u201d Id., at 715. They alleged that the Bank\u2019s\nmarketing materials stated it devoted \u201cthe greater part of\nits assets\u201d to \u201cfirst grade investment bonds (AAA, AA+,\nAA) and shares of stock (of great reputation, liquidity, and\ncredibility).\u201d Id., at 744 (emphasis deleted).\n   (3) Both groups of Louisiana plaintiffs alleged that they\nwere induced to purchase the certificates based on misrep\u00ad\nresentations that the Bank\u2019s assets were \u201c \u2018invested in a\nwell-diversified portfolio of highly marketable securities\nissued by stable governments, strong multinational com\u00ad\npanies and major international banks.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 253, 345.\nAnd they claimed the \u201c \u2018liquidity/marketability of SIB\u2019s\ninvested assets\u2019 \u201d was \u201cthe most important factor to pro\u00ad\nvide security to SIB clients.\u201d Id., at 254.\n   These statements do not allege, for Litigation Act pur\u00ad\nposes, misrepresentations or omissions of material fact \u201cin\nconnection with\u201d the \u201cpurchase or sale of a covered secu-\nrity.\u201d At most, the complaints allege misrepresentations\nabout the Bank\u2019s ownership of covered securities\u2014\nfraudulent assurances that the Bank owned, would own,\nor would use the victims\u2019 money to buy for itself shares of\ncovered securities. But the Bank is an entity that made\nthe misrepresentations. The Bank is the fraudster, not\nthe fraudster\u2019s victim. Nor is the Bank some other person\ntransacting (or refraining from transacting, see Dabit, 547\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

And consequently,\nthere is not the necessary \u201cconnection\u201d between the mate\u00ad\nriality of the misstatements and the statutorily required\n\u201cpurchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d See supra, at 8.\n  A final point: The District Court found that one of the\nplaintiffs acquired Bank certificates \u201cwith the proceeds of\nselling\u201d covered securities contained in his IRA portfolio.\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 12\u201386, p. 70. The plaintiffs,\nhowever, did not allege that the sale of these covered\nsecurities (which were used to finance the purchase of the\ncertificates) constituted any part of the fraudulent scheme.\nNor did the complaints allege that Stanford or his associ\u00ad\nates were at all interested in how the plaintiffs obtained\nthe funds they needed to purchase the certificates. Thus,\nwe agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c[u]nlike Bankers\nLife and Zandford, where the entirety of the fraud de\u00ad\npended upon the tortfeasor convincing the victims of those\nfraudulent schemes to sell their covered securities in order\nfor the fraud to be accomplished, the allegations here are\nnot so tied with the sale of covered securities.\u201d 675 F. 3d,\nat 523. In our view, like that of the Court of Appeals,\nthese sales constituted no relevant part of the fraud but\nwere rather incidental to it.\n  For these reasons the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is\naffirmed.\n                                              It is so ordered.\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

For pur-\nposes of this litigation all accept the premise that Allen\nStanford and SIB induced the investors to purchase the\nCDs by fraudulent representations. In various state and\nfederal courts the investors filed state-law suits against\npersons and entities, including attorneys, accountants,\nbrokers, and investment advisers, alleging that they par-\nticipated in or enabled the fraud. The defendants in the\nstate-court suits removed the actions to federal court,\nwhere they were consolidated with the federal-court suits.\n2          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nThe defendants contended that the state-law suits are\nprecluded under the terms of the Securities Litigation\nUniform Standards Act of 1998 (SLUSA or Act), 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a778bb(f)(1). As the investors prevailed in the Court of\nAppeals, they are the respondents here. The persons and\nentities who were defendants in the state-law actions are\nthe petitioners. The investors contend the state-law suits\nare not precluded by SLUSA, and the petitioners contend\nthe suits are precluded.\n   For purposes of determining SLUSA\u2019s reach, all can\nagree that the CD purchases would not have been, without\nmore, transactions regulated by that Act; for the CDs were\nnot themselves covered securities. As a result, in deter-\nmining whether the Act must be invoked, a further cir-\ncumstance must be considered: The investors purchased\nthe CDs based on the misrepresentations that the CDs\nwere, or would be, backed by investments in, among other\nassets, covered securities.\n   What must be resolved, to determine whether the Act\nprecludes the state-law suits at issue, is whether the\nmisrepresentations regarding covered securities and the\nensuing failure to invest in those securities were so related\nto the purchase of the CDs that the misrepresentations\nwere \u201cmisrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of a material\nfact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered\nsecurity.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A).\n   The opinion for the Court, it seems fair to say, adopts\nthis beginning framework, and it is quite correct to do so.\nThe Court is further correct to view this litigation as in-\nvolving a fraud of a type, scale, and perhaps sophistica-\ntion that has not yet been addressed in its precedents with\nrespect to the applicability of the federal securities laws.\n   It is the premise of this dissent that the more simple\nfrauds addressed in this Court\u2019s precedents, where the\nCourt did find fraud \u201cin connection with the purchase or\nsale,\u201d are applicable here. In those cases, as here, the\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            3\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nimmediate cause of loss to the victim of the fraud was not\nsimply a purchase or sale but rather a fraud that depended\non the purchase or sale of securities or the promise to\ndo so. It is submitted that this litigation should not come\nout differently simply because the fraud here was so wide-\nspread that many investors were misled by misrepresenta-\ntions respecting investments, or promised investments, in\nregulated securities in the markets. And it is necessary to\ncaution that, in holding otherwise, the Court adopts a new\napproach, an approach which departs from the rules es-\ntablished in the earlier, albeit simpler, cases. And, as a\nconsequence, today\u2019s decision, to a serious degree, narrows\nand constricts essential protection for our national securi-\nties markets, protection vital for their strength and in-\ntegrity. The result will be a lessened confidence in the\nmarket, a force for instability that should otherwise be\ncountered by the proper interpretation of federal securities\nlaws and regulations. Though the reasons supporting the\nCourt\u2019s opinion are set forth with care and clarity, this\nrespectful dissent submits that established principles do\nnot support its holding.\n                                I\n    It must be determined whether the misrepresentations\nto the investors\u2014misrepresentations that led them to buy\nCDs in the belief they could rely on the expertise and\nsophistication of Stanford and SIB in the national securi-\nties markets\u2014were \u201cmisrepresentation[s] or omission[s] of\n. . . material fact[s] in connection with the purchase or sale\nof a covered security.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1). This is the\ncentral provision of SLUSA for purposes of this litigation.\nThe Court\u2019s precedents instruct that this language has\nbroad application and must be construed flexibly in order\nto encompass new and ever more ingenious fraudulent\nschemes. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v.\nDabit, 547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006); SEC v. Zandford, 535 U. S.\n4           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n813, 819 (2002). The Court has held that a material mis-\nrepresentation is made \u201cin connection with the purchase\nor sale\u201d of a security when the \u201cfraud coincided with the\nsales [or purchases] themselves.\u201d Zandford, supra, at 820.\n   This significant language must apply here in order to\nimplement two of Congress\u2019 purposes in passing SLUSA.\nFirst, SLUSA seeks to preclude a broad range of state-\nlaw securities claims in order to protect those who advise,\ncounsel, and otherwise assist investors from abusive and\nmultiplicitous class actions designed to extract settlements\nfrom defendants vulnerable to litigation costs. This,\nin turn, protects the integrity of the markets. Second,\neven as the Act cuts back on the availability of state-law\nsecurities claims, a fair interpretation of its language\nensures robust federal regulation of the national securities\nmarkets. That is because, in designing SLUSA, Congress\n\u201cimported the key phrase\u201d from \u00a710(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) Rule 10b\u20135, which provide a private cause\nof action, as well as SEC enforcement authority, for secu-\nrities fraud. Dabit, 547 U. S., at 79, 85. As a result, that\nlanguage must be \u201c \u2018presumed to have the same meaning\u2019 \u201d\nin SLUSA as it does in those contexts. Id., at 86.\n   The Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of the Act\u2019s language\nwill inhibit the SEC and litigants from using federal law\nto police frauds and abuses that undermine confidence in\nthe national securities markets. Throughout the country,\nthen, it will subject many persons and entities whose\nprofession it is to give advice, counsel, and assistance in\ninvesting in the securities markets to complex and costly\nstate-law litigation based on allegations of aiding or par-\nticipating in transactions that are in fact regulated by the\nfederal securities laws.\n                          A\n    Congress enacted SLUSA and its predecessor, the Pri-\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

S.,\nat 81. Congress found that these abuses were being used\n\u201cto injure \u2018the entire U. S. economy.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. The Act and\nits predecessor together addressed these problems by\nlimiting damages, imposing heightened pleading stand-\nards, and, as most relevant here, precluding state-law\nclaims involving nationally traded securities. 112 Stat.\n3227; see S. Rep. No. 104\u201398, pp. 19\u201320 (1995); H. R. Rep.\nNo. 105\u2013640, p. 10 (1998); S. Rep. No. 105\u2013182, pp. 3\u20134\n(1998).\n   In light of the Act\u2019s objectives, the Act must be given\na \u201cbroad construction,\u201d because a \u201cnarrow reading of the\nstatute would undercut the effectiveness\u201d of Congress\u2019\nreforms. Dabit, supra, at 86. Today\u2019s decision does not\nheed that principle. The Court\u2019s narrow reading of the\nstatute will permit proliferation of state-law class actions,\nforcing defendants to defend against multiple suits in\nvarious state fora. This state-law litigation will drive up\nlegal costs for market participants and the secondary\nactors, such as lawyers, accountants, brokers, and advis-\ners, who seek to rely on the stability that results from a\nnational securities market regulated by federal law. See\nCentral Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of\nDenver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 189 (1994). This is a serious\nburden to put on attorneys, accountants, brokers, and\ninvestment advisers nationwide; and that burden itself\nwill make the national securities markets more costly and\ndifficult to enter. The purpose of the Act is to preclude\njust these suits. By permitting the very state-law claims\nCongress intended to prohibit, the Court will undermine\nthe primacy of federal law in policing abuses in the securi-\nties markets.\n   The Court casts its rule as allowing victims to recover\nagainst secondary actors under state law when they would\n6           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nnot be able to recover under federal law due to Central\nBank. Ante, at 12, 17. But in Dabit a unanimous Court\nrejected that conception of SLUSA. A federal-law claim\nwas not available to the plaintiffs in Dabit because Blue\nChip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975),\nlimited the Rule 10b\u20135 private right of action to purchas-\ners and sellers, not holders. \u201c[T]he Second Circuit held\nthat SLUSA only pre-empts state-law class action claims\nbrought by plaintiffs who have a private remedy under\nfederal law.\u201d 547 U. S., at 74. The Court held the oppo-\nsite, \u201cconcluding that SLUSA pre-empts state-law holder\nclass-action claims.\u201d Id., at 87. \u201cIt would be odd, to say\nthe least,\u201d the Court reasoned, \u201cif SLUSA exempted that\nparticularly troublesome subset of class actions from its\npre-emptive sweep.\u201d Id., at 86. The Court in Dabit also\nnoted that SLUSA preclusion does not leave victims with\n\u201cno\u201d ability to \u201crecover damages under state law.\u201d Ante, at\n2. Rather, \u201c[i]t simply denies plaintiffs the right to use the\nclass-action device to vindicate certain claims.\u201d 547 U. S.,\nat 87. The Court in Dabit precluded the suit at issue in\norder to effect the purpose of Blue Chip. By following the\nopposite course today, the Court revisits Dabit\u2019s logic and\nundermines Central Bank.\n                               B\n    Congress intended to make \u201cfederal law, not state law,\n. . . the principal vehicle for asserting class-action securi-\nties fraud claims.\u201d Dabit, supra, at 88. And a broad con-\nstruction of the \u201cin connection with\u201d language found in\nboth SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135 ensures an efficient and\neffective federal regulatory regime, one equal to the task\nof deterring and punishing fraud and providing compensa-\ntion for victims.\n    In undertaking regulation of the national markets\nduring the Great Depression, Congress sought to elimi-\nnate the \u201cabuses which were found to have contributed to\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

In the Securi-\nties Exchange Act, Congress sought \u201c \u2018to achieve a high\nstandard of business ethics in the securities industry\u2019 \u201d\nby \u201c \u2018substitut[ing] a philosophy of full disclosure for the\nphilosophy of caveat emptor.\u2019 \u201d Affiliated Ute Citizens of\nUtah v.

O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S. 642, 658 (1997).\n    Investor confidence indicates fair dealing and integrity\nin the markets. See Dabit, supra, at 78; O\u2019Hagan, supra,\nat 658; see also Central Bank, supra, at 188. It also is\ncritical to achieving an efficient market. The corollary to\nthe principle that insider trading and other frauds have an\n\u201cinhibiting impact on market participation\u201d is that inves-\ntor confidence in strong federal regulation to prevent these\nabuses inspires participation in the market. See O\u2019Hagan,\nsupra, at 659. Widespread market participation in turn\nfacilitates efficient allocation of capital to the Nation\u2019s\ncompanies. See also Central Bank, supra, at 188.\n                              C\n  Mindful of the ends of both SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135, the\nCourt\u2019s precedents interpret the key phrase in both laws\nto mean that a \u201cmisrepresentation or omission of a mate-\nrial fact\u201d is made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale\u201d\nof a security when the \u201cfraud coincided with the sales [or\npurchases] themselves.\u201d Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820; see\nalso Dabit, supra, at 85.\n8          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   This litigation is very similar to Zandford and satisfies\nthe coincides test it sets forth, and for similar reasons. In\nZandford, the SEC brought a civil action against a broker,\nwho, over a period of time, gained control of an investment\naccount, sold its securities, and then pocketed the pro-\nceeds. 535 U. S., at 815\u2013816. The broker argued that \u201cthe\nsales themselves were perfectly lawful and that the sub-\nequent misappropriation of the proceeds, though fraud-\nlent, is not properly viewed as having the requisite\nconnection with the sales.\u201d Id., at 820. The Court rejected\nthat argument. Although the transactions were lawful\nand separate from the misappropriations, the two were\n\u201cnot independent events.\u201d Ibid. Rather, the fraud \u201ccoin-\ncided with the sales,\u201d in part because the sales \u201cfur-\nther[ed]\u201d the fraud. Ibid.\n   The Court likened the broker\u2019s fraud to that in Superin-\ntendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404\nU. S. 6, 10 (1971), where the fraud victims were misled to\nbelieve that they \u201cwould receive the proceeds of the\nsale\u201d of securities. Zandford, 535 U. S., at 821. Like the\nvictims in Bankers Life, the victims in Zandford \u201cwere\ninjured as investors through [the broker]\u2019s deceptions\u201d\nbecause \u201c[t]hey were duped into believing that [the broker]\nwould \u2018conservatively invest\u2019 their assets in the stock\nmarket and that any transactions made on their behalf\nwould be for their benefit.\u201d Id., at 822. Both suffered\nlosses because they were victims of dishonest intermediar-\nies or fiduciaries. See also In re Richard J. Line, 62\nS.E.C. Docket 2879 (1996) (broker who induced parents to\ntransfer funds to him to invest in securities so as to tem-\nporarily hide them during the college financial aid applica-\ntion process, but then failed to return the money, violated\nRule 10b\u20135).\n   Here, just as in Zandford, the victims parted with their\nmoney based on a fraudster\u2019s promise to invest it on their\nbehalf by purchases and sales in the securities markets.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            9\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nThe investors had\u2014or were led to believe they could\nhave\u2014the advantages of Stanford\u2019s and SIB\u2019s expertise\nin investments in the national market. So here, as in\nZandford, the success of the fraud turned on the promise\nto trade in regulated securities. According to the com-\nplaints, SIB represented that it would \u201c \u2018re-inves[t]\u2019 \u201d the\nplaintiffs\u2019 money on their behalf in \u201ca well-diversified\nportfolio of highly marketable securities issued by stable\nnational governments, strong multinational companies,\nand major international banks\u201d to ensure a \u201csafe, liquid,\u201d\nand above-market return. See App. 244, 249, 250, 253,\n336, 342, 345, 444, 470, 480, 628. The misrepresentation\nwas about nationally traded securities and lent credence\nto SIB\u2019s promise that the CDs were a liquid investment\nthat \u201ccould be redeemed with just a few days\u2019 notice.\u201d See\nid., at 253, 345, 445, 628. The CDs, SIB explained, would\nbe backed by nationally traded securities. As a result,\naccording to the complaints, the misrepresentation was\n\u201cmaterial.\u201d Id., at 244\u2013245, 336\u2013338, 480, 715. The fraud\ncould not have succeeded without the misrepresentation:\nThe investors gave SIB money because they expected it to\nbe invested in the national securities markets. The con-\nnection between the promised purchases and the misrep-\nresentation is more direct than in Zandford, because the\nmisrepresentation was essential to the fraud.\n   Here, and again just as in Zandford, the fraud was not\ncomplete until the representation about securities transac-\ntions became untrue, just as Stanford intended all along.\nInstead of purchasing covered securities, SIB purchased\nsome but fewer covered securities than it promised\u2014only\n10% of its portfolio, according to an affidavit attached to a\ncomplaint\u2014and primarily speculated in Caribbean real\nestate. Brief for Respondents 37; App. 594; but see Tr. of\nOral Arg. 43\u201344 (suggesting SIB did not purchase securi-\nties). It was not until SIB rendered the CDs illiquid by\nfailing to make substantial investments in the nationally\n10         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ntraded securities it promised that the fraud was consum-\nmated. At that point, SIB blocked the plaintiffs\u2019 access to\nthe market. The fraud and SIB\u2019s failure to purchase all\nthat it promised were not independent events. Rather, the\nfalse promises to invest in covered securities enabled and\nfurthered the CD fraud. Without the false promise, there\nwould have been no money to purchase the covered securi-\nties. On these facts, this Court\u2019s controlling precedents\ninstruct that these misrepresentations were made \u201cin con-\nection with the purchase or sale\u201d of regulated securi-\nties; and, as a result, state-law claims concerning them\nshould be precluded.\n   Dabit provides further support for this conclusion.\nThere, the Court held that an investment bank that de-\nceived brokers into advising their clients to hold covered\nsecurities made misrepresentations \u201cin connection with\nthe purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d \u201cUnder our\nprecedents,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cit is enough that the\nfraud alleged \u2018coincide\u2019 with a securities transaction\u2014\nwhether by the plaintiff or by someone else.\u201d 547 U. S., at\n85. It did not matter that the plaintiffs did not purchase\nor sell securities, because they were participants in the\nnational markets: \u201cThe requisite showing, in other words,\u201d\nis \u201c \u2018deception \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of\nany security,\u201d not deception of an identifiable purchaser or\nseller.\u2019 \u201d Ibid. (quoting O\u2019Hagan, 521 U. S., at 658). Here,\nfor like reasons, it does not matter that the fraud victims,\nas opposed to Stanford and SIB, were not the ones to fail\nto invest in the market. The very essence of the fraud was\nto induce purchase of the CDs on the (false) promise that\ninvestors should rely on SIB\u2019s special skills and expertise\nin making market investments in covered securities on\ntheir behalf. If promises related to covered securities are\nintegral to the fraud in this direct way, federal regula-\ntion is necessary if confidence in the market is to be\nmaintained.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           11\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\n   That interest is at stake here. Because confidence in the\nability to act as an investor without diversion of funds by\nintermediaries and insiders is critical, it does not matter if\nthe victim of a fraud does not purchase or sell a security,\nDabit, supra, at 85; or if the sale or purchase does not\noccur at the same time as the deception, Bankers Life, 404\nU. S., at 12\u201313; or if no party to the actual transaction is\ndeceived by the fraud, O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 656; or if the\nmisrepresentation has nothing to do with the value of a\ncovered security, Zandford, 535 U. S., at 820. An inves-\ntor\u2019s confidence in the market, and willingness to partici-\npate in it, may be severely undermined if frauds like the\none here are not within the reach of federal regulation.\nFrauds like this one undermine investor confidence in\nattorneys, accountants, brokers, and investment advisers,\nthe intermediaries on whom investors depend to gain\naccess to the market. And when frauds are as widespread\nas this one, the market as a whole is weakened because\ninvestors, including sophisticated ones, are misled as to\nthe amount of funds committed to the market and its\nconsequent stability and resilience.\n   The rule that SLUSA applies when a misrepresentation\nabout the market is coincident to the fraud is, then, essen-\ntial to the framework of the Act and to federal securities\nregulation. Fraudulent practices \u201c \u2018constantly vary,\u2019 \u201d and\n\u201c \u2018practices legitimate for some purposes may be turned to\nillegitimate and fraudulent means.\u2019 \u201d Bankers Life, supra,\nat 12. That is why the key language \u201cshould be construed\nnot technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate\nits remedial purposes.\u201d Zandford, supra, at 819 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see Affiliated Ute, 406 U. S., at\n151. The language merits a \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d be-\ncause it is part of a residuary provision that must be able\nto accommodate evolving methods of fraud by intermediar-\nies and insiders in ever more complicated securities mar-\nkets. Central Bank, 511 U. S., at 174. Its interpretation\n12           CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nshould not privilege fraudsters who devise ever more\ndevious methods of committing fraud involving covered\nsecurities.\n   At the same time, the submitted interpretation is not so\nbroad as to \u201cconvert every common-law fraud that hap-\npens to involve securities into a violation of \u00a710(b)\u201d or\npreclude all state tort claims that involve securities in a\ntangential way. Zandford, supra, at 820. So, for example,\nthe statutory language does not extend to cover a thief\nwho steals money from a store to buy securities or to a\nfraudster who defrauds a bank for a loan that he uses to\nbuy securities. See O\u2019Hagan, supra, at 656. The victims\nin those cases are not concerned about their ability to act\nas investors but rather about their duties as a store clerk\nor a loan officer. Those frauds involve securities transac-\ntions only as happenstance. As a result, the interpretation\nsubmitted in this dissent strikes the balance that Con-\ngress intended between forbidding frauds by intermediar-\nies in the market without reaching frauds that touch the\nmarkets in only tangential ways.\n   The key question is whether the misrepresentation\ncoincides with the purchase or sale of a covered security\nor the purchase or sale of the securities is what enables\nthe fraud. Stanford\u2019s misrepresentation did so. Stanford\npromised to purchase covered securities for investors,\nusing his special expertise, thus allowing investors to rely\non his skill to participate in the national securities mar-\nkets. The entire scheme rested on investors falling for the\ntrick. When covered securities are so integral to the fraud,\nthe false promise is incident to the purchase or sale of\nregulated securities because it coincides with it, and the\nmisrepresentation respecting national securities enabled\nthe fraud.\n                              D\n     The Court interprets the phrase \u201cmisrepresentation or\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            13\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nomission of a material fact in connection with the pur-\nchase or sale of a covered security\u201d\u2014the key phrase in\nSLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135\u2014in a different manner. The\nresult, it is submitted, is inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme Congress enacted and casts doubt on the applica-\nbility of federal securities law to cases of serious securities\nfraud.\n   The Court construes the text of SLUSA and Rule 10b\u20135\nto require a misrepresentation that \u201cis material to a deci-\nsion by one or more individuals (other than the fraudster)\nto buy or sell a \u2018covered security.\u2019 \u201d Ante, at 8. The Act\nsimply does not say that the purchase or sale\u2014or the\npromise to make a purchase or sale\u2014must be by one other\nthan the fraudster. Rather the Act states that there must\nbe \u201ca misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a covered secu-\nrity.\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(1)(A). See 17 CFR \u00a7240.10b\u20135\n(2013) (requiring an \u201cuntrue statement of a material fact\u201d\n\u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d).\nThe Court narrows the statute Congress wrote in two\nways. It excises the important \u201cin connection with\u201d lan-\nguage, resulting in a confined reading inconsistent with\nthe Act\u2019s purpose, structure, and operation. And, by re-\nquiring the purchase or sale be made by someone \u201cother\nthan the fraudster,\u201d the Court inserts a limiting phrase\nthat nowhere appears in the language of the provisions.\nIn litigation like this, this new rule has it upside down.\nWhen the violation that adversely affects the securities\nmarket is done by the fraudster himself, that is all the\nmore reason for applying federal law. This is not a case\nwhere Congress has limited its coverage to a certain sub-\nset of purchasers. Congress enacted such a limit two\nsubsections later in SLUSA when detailing which ac-\ntions are not precluded. See 15 U. S. C. \u00a778bb(f)(3)(A)(ii)(I)\n(\u201cthe purchase or sale of securities by the issuer or an\naffiliate of the issuer exclusively from or to holders of\n14          CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                     KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nequity securities of the issuer\u201d). But it did not do so in the\nprovision at issue.\n   The Court\u2019s reconstruction of the language of the provi-\nsions also casts doubt on the applicability of federal securi-\nties law to three established instances of federal securities\nfraud and one instance of preclusion under the Act as\nadjudged by the Court and the SEC in earlier cases.\n   First, the Court\u2019s interpretation necessarily suggests\nthat Zandford is incorrect and that dishonest brokers need\nnot fear Rule 10b\u20135 liability. The deceit in Zandford was\nthat the broker would act as the victim\u2019s fiduciary when in\nfact he planned on selling (and did sell) the investor\u2019s\nsecurities for his own benefit. 535 U. S., at 820; see also\nLine, 62 S.E.C. Docket 2879 (broker\u2019s deceit was false\npromise to buy). The Court\u2019s rule that liability must rest\non a finding that someone other than the fraudster pur-\nchased or sold securities is inconsistent with Zandford,\nwhere the recipient of the misrepresentation did not buy\nor sell. The Court\u2019s opinion disregards the hazards to the\nmarket when the fraudster is the one acting in the market\nand frustrates the investment objectives of his victims.\n   Second, the Court\u2019s interpretation is difficult to reconcile\nwith liability for insider trading. In O\u2019Hagan, the Court\nheld that the \u201cin connection with\u201d element \u201cis satisfied\nbecause the fiduciary\u2019s fraud is consummated, not when\nthe fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when,\nwithout disclosure to his principal, he uses the infor-\nmation to purchase or sell securities,\u201d \u201ceven though the\nperson or entity defrauded is not the other party to the\ntrade.\u201d 521 U. S., at 656. The Court\u2019s requirement that\nsomeone other than the fraudster purchase or sell a secu-\nrity is hard to square with O\u2019Hagan.\n   Third, the Court\u2019s interpretation is difficult to square\nwith the SEC\u2019s position in In re Orlando Joseph Jett, 82\nS.E.C. Docket 1211 (2004). There, the SEC held liable a\ntrader who fabricated complex trades to supplement the\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nreturns of his real trades, so as to increase his standing\nin his company. The SEC likened Jett to \u201cgarden-variety\nsecurities fraud cases in which a broker-dealer or invest-\nment adviser engages in unsuccessful securities trades for\na client and then hides the losses or inflates the profits by\nsending out false account statements.\u201d Id., at 1253. The\ndecision of the Court today would require that Jett\u2019s mis-\nrepresentation led to the purchase or sale of securities by\nsomeone other than Jett. But the SEC found Jett\u2019s own\npurchases and sales to be sufficient to come within the\nsecurities laws.\n    Finally, the Court\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with the\nunanimous opinion in Dabit, which interpreted the same\nstatutory language at issue in this litigation. Dabit\nsquarely rejected the view that \u201can alleged fraud is \u2018in\nconnection with\u2019 a purchase or sale of securities only when\nthe plaintiff himself was defrauded into purchasing or\nselling particular securities.\u201d 547 U. S., at 85. Instead,\nit approved the SEC\u2019s interpretation that a broker who\n\u201c \u2018sells customer securities with intent to misappropriate\nthe proceeds\u2019 \u201d satisfies the \u201cin connection with the pur-\nchase or sale\u201d requirement. Ibid., n. 10. Dabit cannot be\nreconciled with today\u2019s decision to require someone other\nthan the fraudster buy or sell a security.\n    It is correct that there is no case precisely standing for\nthe proposition that a victim does not have to take an\nownership position. However, O\u2019Hagan supports that\nview. O\u2019Hagan clearly states that in insider trading cases\n\u201cthe person or entity defrauded is not the other party to\nthe trade.\u201d 521 U. S., at 656. And in Zandford a fraudster\ntold customers he would invest \u201ctheir money\u201d in securities\nand then sold those securities. 535 U. S., at 815. Here the\nfraudster told plaintiffs that he would \u201cre-invest\u201d \u201ctheir\u201d\nmoney in securities and then bought different securities.\nApp. 250, 470, 715. The only difference is that there the\nfraudster sold and here he bought. Federal regulation\n16         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                    KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nshould not turn on whether a fraudster arrives before or\nafter an investor makes his first purchase.\n                              II\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation also introduces confusion into\nsecurities law by not defining what it means for someone\n\u201cother than the fraudster to buy or sell\u201d a security, a rule\nthat it derives from its view that the precedents all involve\nvictims who had an ownership interest in securities. Ante,\nat 8\u201310. The precedents the Court cites involve what the\nparties have called direct ownership, where the victim\nbuys or sells an entire equity. By using the term owner-\nship interest instead of ownership, the Court also appears\nto accept the respondents\u2019 concession that indirect owner-\nship, where the victim buys or sells shares in a defendant\nfund that itself owns equities, is sufficient in certain cir-\ncumstances, such as when a victim has \u201csome interest in\nthe defendant\u2019s supposed portfolio.\u201d Brief for Respondents\n16.\n   An ownership rule distinguishing between different\ntypes of indirect ownership is unworkable. Indirect own-\nership is a common type of investment. See M. Fink, The\nRise of Mutual Funds 1 (2008) (U. S. mutual funds have\nover 88 million American shareholders and over $11 tril-\nlion in assets). Yet whether indirect ownership involves\nan interest in the underlying equities is a complex ques-\ntion of corporation, LLC, or partnership law. See In re\nBernard L. Madoff Inv. Securities LLC, 708 F. 3d 422, 427\n(CA2 2013). Congress likely did not intend preclusion of\nstate-law suits to depend on the complexities of the Dela-\nware Code.\n   The Court\u2019s ownership approach also casts doubt on the\nscope of Rule 10b\u20135. Under the Court\u2019s interpretation,\n\u00a710(b) applies to fraudulent mutual or hedge funds not\nbecause those funds invest in securities but because in-\nvestments in the funds are securities. But not all such\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          17\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\ninvestments are securities. 2 L. Ribstein & R. Keatinge,\nLimited Liability Companies \u00a714:2 (2010) (discussing test\nfor a security from SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293\n(1946)); 1 H. Bloomenthal & S. Wolff, Securities Law\nHandbook \u00a7\u00a72:3 to 2:4 (2010). For those that are not, the\nCourt seems to envision liability only when the investment\nconfers an ownership interest in the fund\u2019s securities. And\nthe general rule for investments in funds organized as\nLLPs and LLCs is that they do not convey such claims.\n1 Ribstein & Keatinge, supra, \u00a77:11; see In re Herald, 730\nF. 3d 112 (CA2 2013). As a result, in important instances\nRule 10b\u20135 may not extend to mutual and hedge funds\nunder the Court\u2019s interpretation.\n  It is true that the SEC pursued the fraudster with suc-\ncess here. But that is because the CDs are securities. See\nOrder Denying Motion to Dismiss in SEC v. Stanford\nInternational Bank, No. 3\u201309\u2013CV\u20130298\u2013N (ND Tex., Nov.\n30, 2011), pp. 5\u201310. This aspect of Stanford\u2019s fraud is not\na necessary feature of all frauds involving funds similar\nto SIB.\n                             III\n  The fraudster in this litigation misrepresented that he\nwould purchase nationally traded securities. That mis-\nrepresentation was made \u201cin connection with the purchase\nor sale\u201d of the promised securities because it coincided\nwith them. The fraud turned on the misrepresentation.\nThe Court\u2019s contrary interpretation excises the phrase \u201cin\nconnection with\u201d from the Act, a phrase that the Court in\nearlier cases held to require a broad and flexible meaning.\nAt the same time, by holding that the purchase or sale of\nsecurities be made by someone other than the fraudster,\nthe Court engrafts a limitation that does not appear in the\ntext. The result is to constrict the application of federal\nsecurities regulation in instances where dishonest brokers,\ninsider traders, and lying employees purchase or sell\n18         CHADBOURNE & PARKE LLP v. TROICE\n\n                   KENNEDY, J., dissenting\n\nsecurities, or promise to do so, as part of the fraud. To-\nday\u2019s decision introduces confusion in the enforcement of\nsecurities laws.\n  For these reasons, it is submitted that the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals should be reversed.\n</pre>",
