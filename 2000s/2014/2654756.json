UNITED STATES\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n  No. 12–464.      Argued October 16, 2013—Decided February 25, 2014\nTitle 21 U. S. C. §853(e)(1) empowers courts to enter pre-trial restrain-\n  ing orders to “preserve the availability of [forfeitable] property” while\n  criminal proceedings are pending. Such pre-trial asset restraints are\n  constitutionally permissible whenever probable cause exists to think\n  that a defendant has committed an offense permitting forfeiture and\n  that the assets in dispute are traceable or otherwise sufficiently re-\n  lated to the crime charged. United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600.\n     After a grand jury indicted petitioners, Kerri and Brian Kaley, for\n  reselling stolen medical devices and laundering the proceeds, the\n  Government obtained a §853(e)(1) restraining order against their as-\n  sets. The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, intending to use a por-\n  tion of the disputed assets for their legal fees. The District Court al-\n  lowed them to challenge the assets’ traceability to the offenses in\n  question but not the facts supporting the underlying indictment. The\n  Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: When challenging the legality of a §853(e)(1) pre-trial asset sei-\n zure, a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitution-\n ally entitled to contest a grand jury’s determination of probable cause\n to believe the defendant committed the crimes charged. Pp. 5–21.\n    (a) In Monsanto, this Court held that the Government may seize\n assets before trial that a defendant intends to use to pay an attorney,\n so long as probable cause exists “to believe that the property will ul-\n timately be proved forfeitable.” 491 U. S., at 615. The question\n whether indicted defendants like the Kaleys are constitutionally enti-\n tled to a judicial re-determination of the grand jury’s probable cause\n conclusion in a hearing to lift an asset restraint has a ready answer\n in the fundamental and historic commitment of the criminal justice\n system to entrust probable cause findings to a grand jury. A probable\n2                       KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cause finding sufficient to initiate a prosecution for a serious crime is\n    “conclusive[e],” Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 117, n. 19, and, as a\n    general matter, “a challenge to the reliability or competence of the ev-\n    idence” supporting that finding “will not be heard,” United States v.\n    Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 54. A grand jury’s probable cause finding\n    may, on its own, effect a pre-trial restraint on a person’s liberty. Ger-\n    stein, 420 U. S., at 117, n. 19. The same result follows when it works\n    to restrain a defendant’s property.\n       The Kaleys’ alternative rule would have strange and destructive\n    consequences. Allowing a judge to decide anew what the grand jury\n    has already determined could result in two inconsistent findings gov-\n    erning different aspects of one criminal proceeding, with the same\n    judge who found probable cause lacking presiding over a trial prem-\n    ised on its existence. That legal dissonance could not but undermine\n    the criminal justice system’s integrity, especially the grand jury’s\n    constitutional role. Pp. 5–12.\n       (b) The balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319—\n    which requires a court to weigh (1) the burdens that a requested pro-\n    cedure would impose on the government against (2) the private inter-\n    est at stake, as viewed alongside (3) “the risk of an erroneous depri-\n    vation” of that interest without the procedure and “the probable\n    value, if any, of [the] additional . . . procedural safeguar[d],” id., at\n    335—if applicable here, tips against the Kaleys. Because the Gov-\n    ernment’s interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without\n    an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal\n    charges and the Kaleys’ interest in retaining counsel of their own\n    choosing are both substantial, the test’s third prong is critical. It\n    boils down to the “probable value, if any,” of a judicial hearing in un-\n    covering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings. But when the\n    legal standard is merely probable cause and the grand jury has al-\n    ready made that finding, a full-dress hearing will provide little bene-\n    fit. See Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. ___, ___. A finding of probable\n    cause to think that a person committed a crime “can be [made] relia-\n    bly without an adversary hearing,” Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 120, and\n    the value of requiring additional “formalities and safeguards” would\n    “[i]n most cases . . . be too slight,” id., at 121–122. The experience of\n    several Circuits corroborates this view. Neither the Kaleys nor their\n    amici point to a single case in two decades where courts, holding\n    hearings of the kind they seek, have found the absence of probable\n    cause to believe that an indicted defendant committed the crime\n    charged.

UNITED \n\n                     STATES \n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n          APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n                              [February 25, 2014]\n\n\n   JUSTICE KAGAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n   A federal statute, 21 U. S. C. §853(e), authorizes a court\nto freeze an indicted defendant’s assets prior to trial if\nthey would be subject to forfeiture upon conviction. In\nUnited States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 615 (1989), we\napproved the constitutionality of such an order so long as\nit is “based on a finding of probable cause to believe that\nthe property will ultimately be proved forfeitable.” And\nwe held that standard to apply even when a defendant\nseeks to use the disputed property to pay for a lawyer.\n   In this case, two indicted defendants wishing to hire an\nattorney challenged a pre-trial restraint on their property.\nThe trial court convened a hearing to consider the sei-\nzure’s legality under Monsanto. The question presented is\nwhether criminal defendants are constitutionally entitled\nat such a hearing to contest a grand jury’s prior determi-\nnation of probable cause to believe they committed the\ncrimes charged. We hold that they have no right to reliti-\ngate that finding.\n2                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Criminal forfeitures are imposed upon conviction to\nconfiscate assets used in or gained from certain serious\ncrimes. See 21 U. S. C. §853(a). Forfeitures help to en-\nsure that crime does not pay: They at once punish wrong-\ndoing, deter future illegality, and “lessen the economic\npower” of criminal enterprises. Caplin & Drysdale, Char-\ntered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 630 (1989); see id., at\n634 (“Forfeiture provisions are powerful weapons in the\nwar on crime”). The Government also uses forfeited prop-\nerty to recompense victims of crime, improve conditions in\ncrime-damaged communities, and support law enforce-\nment activities like police training. See id., at 629–630.1\nAccordingly, “there is a strong governmental interest in\nobtaining full recovery of all forfeitable assets.” Id., at\n631.\n   In line with that interest, §853(e)(1) empowers courts to\nenter pre-trial restraining orders or injunctions to “pre-\nserve the availability of [forfeitable] property” while crim-\ninal proceedings are pending. Such an order, issued\n“[u]pon application of the United States,” prevents a de-\nfendant from spending or transferring specified property,\nincluding to pay an attorney for legal services. Ibid. In\nMonsanto, our principal case involving this procedure, we\nheld a pre-trial asset restraint constitutionally permissible\nwhenever there is probable cause to believe that the property\nis forfeitable. See 491 U. S., at 615.

See §853(a).\nThe Monsanto Court, however, declined to consider\n“whether the Due Process Clause requires a hearing” to\nestablish either or both of those aspects of forfeitability.\nId., at 615, n. 10.2\n  Since Monsanto, the lower courts have generally pro-\nvided a hearing to any indicted defendant seeking to lift an\nasset restraint to pay for a lawyer. In that hearing, they\nhave uniformly allowed the defendant to litigate the sec-\nond issue stated above: whether probable cause exists to\nbelieve that the assets in dispute are traceable or other-\nwise sufficiently related to the crime charged in the in-\ndictment.3 But the courts have divided over extending the\nhearing to the first issue. Some have considered, while\nothers have barred, a defendant’s attempt to challenge the\nprobable cause underlying a criminal charge.4 This case\nraises the question whether an indicted defendant has a\nconstitutional right to contest the grand jury’s prior de-\ntermination of that matter.\n——————\n   2 The forfeiture statute itself requires a hearing when the Govern-\n\nment seeks to restrain the assets of someone who has not yet been\nindicted. See 21 U. S. C. §853(e)(1)(B). That statutory provision is not\nat issue in this case, which involves a pair of indicted defendants.\n   3 At oral argument, the Government agreed that a defendant has a\n\nconstitutional right to a hearing on that question. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n45. We do not opine on the matter here.\n   4 Compare United States v. E-Gold, Ltd., 521 F. 3d 411 (CADC 2008)\n\n(holding that a defendant is entitled to raise such a challenge); United\nStates v. Dejanu, 37 Fed. Appx. 870, 873 (CA9 2002) (same); United\nStates v.

UNITED STATES\n\n\n                         Opinion of the Court \n\n\n                             B\n\n  The grand jury’s indictment in this case charges a\nscheme to steal prescription medical devices and resell\nthem for profit. The indictment accused petitioner Kerri\nKaley, a sales representative for a subsidiary of Johnson &\nJohnson, and petitioner Brian Kaley, her husband, with\ntransporting stolen medical devices across state lines and\nlaundering the proceeds of that activity.5 The Kaleys have\ncontested those allegations throughout this litigation,\narguing that the medical devices at issue were unwanted,\nexcess hospital inventory, which they could lawfully take\nand market to others.\n  Immediately after obtaining the indictment, the Gov-\nernment sought a restraining order under §853(e)(1) to\nprevent the Kaleys from transferring any assets traceable\nto or involved in the alleged offenses. Included among\nthose assets is a $500,000 certificate of deposit that the\nKaleys intended to use for legal fees. The District Court\nentered the requested order. Later, in response to the\nKaleys’ motion to vacate the asset restraint, the court\ndenied a request for an evidentiary hearing and confirmed\nthe order, except as to $63,000 that it found (based on the\nparties’ written submissions) was not connected to the\nalleged offenses.\n  On interlocutory appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed\nand remanded for further consideration of whether some\nkind of evidentiary hearing was warranted. See 579 F. 3d\n1246 (2009). The District Court then concluded that it\nshould hold a hearing, but only as to “whether the re-\n——————\n  5An earlier version of the indictment did not include the money laun-\n\ndering charge. In its superseding indictment, the Government also\naccused Jennifer Gruenstrass, another sales representative, of trans-\nporting stolen property and money laundering. Her case went to trial,\nand she was acquitted. Several other sales representatives participat-\ning in the Kaleys’ activity entered guilty pleas (each to a charge of\nshipping stolen goods) during the Government’s investigation.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrained assets are traceable to or involved in the alleged\ncriminal conduct.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43, n. 5. The\nKaleys informed the court that they no longer disputed\nthat issue; they wished to show only that the “case against\nthem is ‘baseless.’ ” Id., at 39; see App. 107 (“We are not\ncontesting that the assets restrained were . . . traceable to\nthe conduct. Our quarrel is whether that conduct consti-\ntutes a crime”). Accordingly, the District Court affirmed\nthe restraining order, and the Kaleys took another appeal.\nThe Eleventh Circuit this time affirmed, holding that the\nKaleys were not entitled at a hearing on the asset freeze\n“to challenge the factual foundation supporting the grand\njury’s probable cause determination[ ]”—that is, “the very\nvalidity of the underlying indictment.” 677 F. 3d 1316,\n1317 (2012).\n  We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split on the\nquestion presented, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), and we now affirm\nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n                               II\n  This Court has twice considered claims, similar to the\nKaleys’, that the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process\nand the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel constrain the\nway the federal forfeiture statute applies to assets needed\nto retain an attorney. See Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U. S.\n617; Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600. We begin with those rul-\nings not as mere background, but as something much\nmore. On the single day the Court decided both those\ncases, it cast the die on this one too.\n  In Caplin & Drysdale, we considered whether the Fifth\nand Sixth Amendments exempt from forfeiture money that\na convicted defendant has agreed to pay his attorney. See\n491 U. S., at 623–635. We conceded a factual premise of\nthe constitutional claim made in the case: Sometimes “a\ndefendant will be unable to retain the attorney of his\nchoice,” if he cannot use forfeitable assets. Id., at 625.\n6                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStill, we held, the defendant’s claim was “untenable.” Id.,\nat 626. “A defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to\nspend another person’s money” for legal fees—even if that\nis the only way to hire a preferred lawyer. Ibid. Consider,\nwe submitted, the example of a “robbery suspect” who\nwishes to “use funds he has stolen from a bank to retain\nan attorney to defend him if he is apprehended.” Ibid.\nThat money is “not rightfully his.” Ibid. Accordingly, we\nconcluded, the Government does not violate the Constitu-\ntion if, pursuant to the forfeiture statute, “it seizes the\nrobbery proceeds and refuses to permit the defendant to\nuse them” to pay for his lawyer. Ibid.\n   And then, we confirmed in Monsanto what our “robbery\nsuspect” hypothetical indicated: Even prior to conviction\n(or trial)—when the presumption of innocence still applies—\nthe Government could constitutionally use §853(e) to\nfreeze assets of an indicted defendant “based on a find-\ning of probable cause to believe that the property will\nultimately be proved forfeitable.” 491 U. S., at 615. In\nMonsanto, too, the defendant wanted to use the property\nat issue to pay a lawyer, and maintained that the Fifth\nand Sixth Amendments entitled him to do so. We dis-\nagreed.     We first noted that the Government may\nsometimes “restrain persons where there is a finding of\nprobable cause to believe that the accused has committed\na serious offense.” Id., at 615–616. Given that power, we\ncould find “no constitutional infirmity in §853(e)’s authori-\nzation of a similar restraint on [the defendant’s] property”\nin order to protect “the community’s interest” in recover-\ning “ill-gotten gains.” Id., at 616. Nor did the defendant’s\ninterest in retaining a lawyer with the disputed assets\nchange the equation. Relying on Caplin & Drysdale, we\nreasoned: “[I]f the Government may, post-trial, forbid the\nuse of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then surely no\nconstitutional violation occurs when, after probable cause\nis adequately established, the Government obtains an\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder barring a defendant from frustrating that end by\ndissipating his assets prior to trial.” Ibid. So again: With\nprobable cause, a freeze is valid.\n   The Kaleys little dispute that proposition; their argu-\nment is instead about who should have the last word as to\nprobable cause. A grand jury has already found probable\ncause to think that the Kaleys committed the offenses\ncharged; that is why an indictment issued. No one doubts\nthat those crimes are serious enough to trigger forfeiture.\nSimilarly, no one contests that the assets in question\nderive from, or were used in committing, the offenses. See\nsupra, at 5. The only question is whether the Kaleys are\nconstitutionally entitled to a judicial re-determination of\nthe conclusion the grand jury already reached: that proba-\nble cause supports this criminal prosecution (or alterna-\ntively put, that the prosecution is not “baseless,” as the\nKaleys believe, supra, at 5). And that question, we think,\nhas a ready answer, because a fundamental and historic\ncommitment of our criminal justice system is to entrust\nthose probable cause findings to grand juries.\n   This Court has often recognized the grand jury’s singu-\nlar role in finding the probable cause necessary to initiate\na prosecution for a serious crime. See, e.g., Costello v.\nUnited States, 350 U. S. 359, 362 (1956). “[A]n indictment\n‘fair upon its face,’ and returned by a ‘properly constituted\ngrand jury,’ ” we have explained, “conclusively determines\nthe existence of probable cause” to believe the defendant\nperpetrated the offense alleged. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420\nU. S. 103, 117, n. 19 (1975) (quoting Ex parte United\nStates, 287 U. S. 241, 250 (1932)). And “conclusively” has\nmeant, case in and case out, just that. We have found no\n“authority for looking into and revising the judgment of\nthe grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose of de-\ntermining whether or not the finding was founded upon\nsufficient proof.” Costello, 350 U. S., at 362–363 (quoting\nUnited States v. Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Cas.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (No. 16,134) (CC\n8                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nNDNY 1852) (Nelson, J.)). To the contrary, “the whole\nhistory of the grand jury institution” demonstrates that “a\nchallenge to the reliability or competence of the evidence”\nsupporting a grand jury’s finding of probable cause “will\nnot be heard.” United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 54\n(1992) (quoting Costello, 350 U. S., at 364, and Bank of\nNova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, 261 (1988)).\nThe grand jury gets to say—without any review, oversight,\nor second-guessing—whether probable cause exists to\nthink that a person committed a crime.\n  And that inviolable grand jury finding, we have decided,\nmay do more than commence a criminal proceeding (with\nall the economic, reputational, and personal harm that\nentails); the determination may also serve the purpose of\nimmediately depriving the accused of her freedom. If the\nperson charged is not yet in custody, an indictment trig-\ngers “issuance of an arrest warrant without further in-\nquiry” into the case’s strength. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 117,\nn. 19; see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 129 (1997).\nAlternatively, if the person was arrested without a war-\nrant, an indictment eliminates her Fourth Amendment\nright to a prompt judicial assessment of probable cause to\nsupport any detention. See Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 114,\n117, n. 19. In either situation, this Court—relying on the\ngrand jury’s “historical role of protecting individuals from\nunjust persecution”—has “let [that body’s] judgment sub-\nstitute for that of a neutral and detached magistrate.”\nIbid. The grand jury, all on its own, may effect a pre-trial\nrestraint on a person’s liberty by finding probable cause to\nsupport a criminal charge.6\n——————\n  6 The grand jury’s unreviewed finding similarly may play a significant\n\nrole in determining a defendant’s eligibility for release before trial\nunder the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §3141 et seq.

If judicial review\nof the grand jury’s probable cause determination is not\nwarranted (as we have so often held) to put a defendant on\ntrial or place her in custody, then neither is it needed to\nfreeze her property. The grand jury that is good enough—\nreliable enough, protective enough—to inflict those other\ngrave consequences through its probable cause findings\nmust be adequate to impose this one too. Indeed,\nMonsanto already noted the absence of any reason to hold\nproperty seizures to different rules: As described earlier,\nthe Court partly based its adoption of the probable cause\nstandard on the incongruity of subjecting an asset freeze\nto any stricter requirements than apply to an arrest or\nensuing detention. See supra, at 6; 491 U. S., at 615 (“[I]t\n——————\nformly held that presumption to operate whenever an indictment\ncharges those offenses. Relying on our instruction that an indictment\nreturned by a proper grand jury “conclusively determines the existence\nof probable cause,” the courts have denied defendants’ calls for any\njudicial reconsideration of that issue. United States v. Contreras, 776\nF. 2d 51, 54 (CA2 1985) (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 117,\nn. 19 (1975)); see, e.g., United States v. Suppa, 799 F. 2d 115, 117–119\n(CA3 1986); United States v. Vargas, 804 F. 2d 157, 162–163 (CA1\n1986) (per curiam); United States v. Hurtado, 779 F. 2d 1467, 1477–\n1479 (CA11 1985).\n   The dissent, while conceding this point, notes that courts may con-\nsider the “weight of the evidence” in deciding whether a defendant has\nrebutted the presumption. See post, at 9–10, and n. 3 (opinion of\nROBERTS, C. J.). And so they may, along with a host of other factors\nrelating to the defendant’s dangerousness or risk of flight. See\n§3142(g). But that is because the Bail Reform Act so allows—not\nbecause (as argued here) the Constitution compels the inquiry. And\neven that provision of the statute cuts against the dissent’s position,\nbecause it enables courts to consider only an evidentiary issue different\nfrom the probable cause determination. When it comes to whether\nprobable cause supports a charge—i.e., the issue here—courts making\nbail determinations are stuck, as all agree, with the grand jury’s\nfinding.\n10                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould be odd to conclude that the Government may not\nrestrain property” on the showing often sufficient to “re-\nstrain persons”). By similar token, the probable cause\nstandard, once selected, should work no differently for the\nsingle purpose of freezing assets than for all others.7 So\nthe longstanding, unvarying rule of criminal procedure we\nhave just described applies here as well: The grand jury’s\ndetermination is conclusive.\n   And indeed, the alternative rule the Kaleys seek would\nhave strange and destructive consequences. The Kaleys\nhere demand a do-over, except with a different referee.\nThey wish a judge to decide anew the exact question the\ngrand jury has already answered—whether there is prob-\nable cause to think the Kaleys committed the crimes\ncharged. But suppose the judge performed that task and\ncame to the opposite conclusion. Two inconsistent findings\nwould then govern different aspects of one criminal pro-\nceeding: Probable cause would exist to bring the Kaleys to\ntrial (and, if otherwise appropriate, hold them in prison),\nbut not to restrain their property. And assuming the\nprosecutor continued to press the charges,8 the same judge\nwho found probable cause lacking would preside over a\n——————\n  7Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, see post, at 11–12, noth-\n\ning in our reasoning depends on viewing one consequence of a probable\ncause determination (say, detention) as “greater” than another (say, the\nasset freeze here). (We suspect that would vary from case to case, with\nsome defendants seeing the loss of liberty as the more significant\ndeprivation and others the loss of a chosen lawyer.) We simply see no\nreason to treat a grand jury’s probable cause determination as conclu-\nsive for all other purposes (including, in some circumstances, locking up\nthe defendant), but not for the one at issue here.\n  8A prosecutor, of course, might drop the case because of the court’s\n\nruling, especially if he thought that decision would bring into play an\nethical standard barring any charge “that the prosecutor knows is not\nsupported by probable cause.” ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct\n3.8(a) (2013). But then the court would have effectively done what we\nhave long held it cannot: overrule the grand jury on whether to bring a\ndefendant to trial. See supra, at 7–8.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial premised on its presence. That legal dissonance, if\nsustainable at all, could not but undermine the criminal\njustice system’s integrity—and especially the grand jury’s\nintegral, constitutionally prescribed role. For in this new\nworld, every prosecution involving a pre-trial asset freeze\nwould potentially pit the judge against the grand jury as\nto the case’s foundational issue.9\n   The Kaleys counter (as does the dissent, post, at 7) that\napparently inconsistent findings are not really so, because\nthe prosecutor could have presented scantier evidence to\nthe judge than he previously offered the grand jury. Sup-\npose, for example, that at the judicial hearing the prosecu-\ntor put on only “one witness instead of all five”; then, the\nKaleys maintain, the judge’s decision of no probable cause\nwould mean only that “the Government did not satisfy its\nburden[ ] on that one day in time.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 18;\nsee Reply Brief 11–12. But we do not think that hypothet-\nical solves the problem. As an initial matter, it does not\nforeclose a different fact pattern: A judge could hear the\nexact same evidence as the grand jury, yet respond to it\ndifferently, thus rendering what even the Kaleys must\nconcede is a contradictory finding. And when the Kaleys’\nhypothetical is true, just what does it show? Consider that\nthe prosecutor in their example has left home some of the\nwitnesses he took to the grand jury—presumably because,\nas we later discuss, he does not yet wish to reveal their\nidentities or likely testimony. See infra, at 14–15. The\n——————\n  9 The dissent argues that the same is true when a judge hears evi-\n\ndence on whether frozen assets are traceable to a crime, because that\nallegation also appears in the indictment. See post, at 6–7; supra, at 3,\nand n. 3. But the tracing of assets is a technical matter far removed\nfrom the grand jury’s core competence and traditional function—to\ndetermine whether there is probable cause to think the defendant\ncommitted a crime. And a judge’s finding that assets are not traceable\nto the crime charged in no way casts doubt on the prosecution itself. So\nthat determination does not similarly undermine the grand jury or\ncreate internal contradictions within the criminal justice system.\n12                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njudge’s ruling of no probable cause therefore would not\nmean that the grand jury was wrong: As the Kaleys con-\ncede, the grand jury could have heard more than enough\nevidence to find probable cause that they committed the\ncrimes charged. The Kaleys would win at the later hear-\ning despite, not because of, the case’s true merits. And we\nwould then see still less reason for a judge to topple the\ngrand jury’s (better supported) finding of probable cause.10\n  Our reasoning so far is straightforward. We held in\nMonsanto that the probable cause standard governs the\npre-trial seizure of forfeitable assets, even when they are\nneeded to hire a lawyer. And we have repeatedly affirmed\na corollary of that standard: A defendant has no right to\njudicial review of a grand jury's determination of probable\ncause to think a defendant committed a crime. In combi-\nnation, those settled propositions signal defeat for the\nKaleys because, in contesting the seizure of their property,\nthey seek only to relitigate such a grand jury finding.\n                            III\n   The Kaleys would have us undertake a different analy-\nsis, which they contend would lead to a different conclu-\nsion. They urge us to apply the balancing test of Mathews\nv. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), to assess whether they\nhave received a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to\nchallenge the seizure of their assets. See Brief for Peti-\ntioners 32–64. Under that three-pronged test (reordered\n——————\n  10 The dissent claims as well that the hearing the Kaleys seek “would\n\nnot be mere relitigation” of the grand jury’s decision because they could\nnow “tell their side of the story.” Post, at 8. But the same could be said\nof an adversarial hearing on an indictment’s validity, which everyone\nagrees is impermissible because it “look[s] into and revise[s]” the grand\njury’s judgment. See ibid. (quoting Costello v. United States, 350 U. S.\n359, 362 (1956)). The lesson of our precedents, as described above, is\nthat a grand jury’s finding is “conclusive”—and thus precludes subse-\nquent proceedings on the same matter—even though not arising from\nadversarial testing. See supra, at 7–8; see also infra, at 17–18.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhere for expositional purposes), a court must weigh (1) the\nburdens that a requested procedure would impose on the\nGovernment against (2) the private interest at stake, as\nviewed alongside (3) “the risk of an erroneous deprivation”\nof that interest without the procedure and “the probable\nvalue, if any, of [the] additional . . . procedural safe-\nguard[ ].” Mathews, 424 U. S., at 335. Stressing the\nimportance of their interest in retaining chosen counsel,\nthe Kaleys argue that the Mathews balance tilts hard\nin their favor. It thus overrides—or so the Kaleys claim—\nall we have previously held about the finality of grand\njury findings, entitling them to an evidentiary hearing be-\nfore a judge to contest the probable cause underlying the\nindictment.\n   The Government battles with the Kaleys over whether\nMathews has any application to this case. This Court\ndevised the test, the Government notes, in an administra-\ntive setting—to decide whether a Social Security recipient\nwas entitled to a hearing before her benefits were termi-\nnated. And although the Court has since employed the\napproach in other contexts, the Government reads Medina\nv. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992), as foreclosing its use\nhere. In that case, we held that “the Mathews balancing\ntest does not provide the appropriate framework for as-\nsessing the validity of state procedural rules which . . . are\npart of the criminal process,” reasoning that because the\n“Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of\ncriminal procedure,” the Due Process Clause “has limited\noperation” in the field. Id., at 443. That settles that,\nasserts the Government. See Brief for United States 18.\nBut the Kaleys argue that Medina addressed a State’s\nprocedural rule and relied on federalism principles not\nimplicated here. Further, they claim that Medina con-\ncerned a criminal proceeding proper, not a collateral ac-\ntion seizing property. See Reply Brief 1–5. As to that sort\nof action, the Kaleys contend, Mathews should govern.\n14               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We decline to address those arguments, or to define the\nrespective reach of Mathews and Medina, because we need\nnot do so. Even if Mathews applied here—even if, that is,\nits balancing inquiry were capable of trumping this\nCourt’s repeated admonitions that the grand jury’s word is\nconclusive—the Kaleys still would not be entitled to the\nhearing they seek. That is because the Mathews test tips\nagainst them, and so only reinforces what we have already\nsaid. As we will explain, the problem for the Kaleys comes\nfrom Mathews’ prescribed inquiry into the requested\nprocedure’s usefulness in correcting erroneous depriva-\ntions of their private interest. In light of Monsanto’s\nholding that a seizure of the Kaleys’ property is erroneous\nonly if unsupported by probable cause, the added proce-\ndure demanded here is not sufficiently likely to make any\ndifference.\n   To begin the Mathews analysis, the Government has a\nsubstantial interest in freezing potentially forfeitable\nassets without an evidentiary hearing about the probable\ncause underlying criminal charges. At the least, such an\nadversarial proceeding—think of it as a pre-trial mini-trial\n(or maybe a pre-trial not-so-mini-trial)—could consume\nsignificant prosecutorial time and resources. The hearing\npresumably would rehearse the case’s merits, including\nthe Government’s theory and supporting evidence. And\nthe Government also might have to litigate a range of\nancillary questions relating to the conduct of the hearing\nitself (for example, could the Kaleys subpoena witnesses or\nexclude certain evidence?).\n   Still more seriously, requiring a proceeding of that kind\ncould undermine the Government’s ability either to obtain\na conviction or to preserve forfeitable property. To ensure\na favorable result at the hearing, the Government could\nchoose to disclose all its witnesses and other evidence.\nBut that would give the defendant knowledge of the Gov-\nernment’s case and strategy well before the rules of crimi-\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

S. 83 (1963)—would otherwise\nrequire. See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 26.2(a), 16(a)(2);\nWeatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559–561 (1977)\n(“There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a\ncriminal case”). And sometimes (particularly in organized\ncrime and drug trafficking prosecutions, in which forfeit-\nure questions often arise), that sneak preview might not\njust aid the defendant’s preparations but also facilitate\nwitness tampering or jeopardize witness safety. Alterna-\ntively, to ensure the success of its prosecution, the Gov-\nernment could hold back some of its evidence at the hear-\ning or give up on the pre-trial seizure entirely. But if the\nGovernment took that tack, it would diminish the likeli-\nhood of ultimately recovering stolen assets to which the\npublic is entitled.11 So any defense counsel worth his\nsalt—whatever the merits of his case—would put the\nprosecutor to a choice: “Protect your forfeiture by provid-\ning discovery” or “protect your conviction by surrendering\nthe assets.”12 It is small wonder that the Government\n——————\n  11 The  dissent says not to worry—the Government can obtain the\nassets after conviction by using 21 U. S. C. §853(c)’s “relation-back”\nprovision. See post, at 15. That provision is intended to aid the Gov-\nernment in recovering funds transferred to a third party—here, the\nKaleys’ lawyer—subsequent to the crime. But forfeiture applies only to\nspecific assets, so in the likely event that the third party has spent the\nmoney, the Government must resort to a State’s equitable remedies—\nwhich may or may not even be available—to force him to disgorge an\nequivalent amount. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49. And indeed, if the\nGovernment could easily recover such monies, then few lawyers would\nagree to represent defendants like the Kaleys, and the dissent’s pro-\nposed holding would be for naught.\n  12 Compare Cassella, Criminal Forfeiture Procedure, 32 Am. J. Crim.\n\nL. 55, 63 (2004) (explaining that “defendants tend to demand the\nhearing . . . to afford defense counsel an early opportunity to discover\nthe nature of the Government’s criminal case and to cross-examine\nsome of the Government’s witnesses”) with May, Attorney Fees and\nGovernment Forfeiture, 34 Champion 20, 23 (Apr. 2010) (advising that\n16                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nwants to avoid that lose-lose dilemma.\n  For their part, however, defendants like the Kaleys have\na vital interest at stake: the constitutional right to retain\ncounsel of their own choosing. See Wheat v. United States,\n486 U. S. 153, 159 (1988) (describing the scope of, and\nvarious limits on, that right). This Court has recently\ndescribed that right, separate and apart from the guaran-\ntee to effective representation, as “the root meaning” of the\nSixth Amendment. United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\nU. S. 140, 147–148 (2006); cf. Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S.\n45, 53 (1932) (“It is hardly necessary to say that, the right\nto counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded\na fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice”).13\nIndeed, we have held that the wrongful deprivation of\nchoice of counsel is “structural error,” immune from review\nfor harmlessness, because it “pervades the entire trial.”\nGonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 150. Different lawyers do all\nkinds of things differently, sometimes “affect[ing] whether\nand on what terms the defendant . . . plea bargains, or\ndecides instead to go to trial”—and if the latter, possibly\naffecting whether she gets convicted or what sentence she\nreceives. Ibid. So for defendants like the Kaleys, having\n\n——————\n“[e]ven if defense counsel cannot prevail on the facts or the law, he may\nbe able to prevail anyway” because “[s]ometimes the government will\ndecide to give up its restraint on a piece of property rather than engage\nin litigation that will result in early discovery”).\n   13 Still, a restraint on assets could not deprive the Kaleys of represen-\n\ntation sufficient to ensure fair proceedings. The Sixth Amendment\nwould require the appointment of effective counsel if the Kaleys were\nunable to hire a lawyer. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). The vast majority\nof criminal defendants proceed with appointed counsel. And the Court\nhas never thought, as the dissent suggests today, that doing so risks\nthe “fundamental fairness of the actual trial.” Post, at 12; see post, at\n17–18. If it does, the right way to start correcting the problem is not by\nadopting the dissent’s position, but by ensuring that the right to effec-\ntive counsel is fully vindicated.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ability to retain the “counsel [they] believe[ ] to be\nbest”—and who might in fact be superior to any existing\nalternatives—matters profoundly. Id., at 146.\n   And yet Monsanto held, crucially for the last part of our\nMathews analysis, that an asset freeze depriving a defend-\nant of that interest is erroneous only when unsupported\nby a finding of probable cause. Recall that Monsanto\nconsidered a case just like this one, where the defendant\nwanted to use his property to pay his preferred lawyer.\nHe urged the Court to hold that the Government could\nseize assets needed for that purpose only after conviction.\nBut we instead decided that the Government could act\n“after probable cause [that the assets are forfeitable] is\nadequately established.” 491 U. S., at 616. And that\nmeans in a case like this one—where the assets’ connec-\ntion to the allegedly illegal conduct is not in dispute, see\nsupra, at 5—that a pre-trial seizure is wrongful only when\nthere is no probable cause to believe the defendants com-\nmitted the crimes charged. Or to put the same point\ndifferently, such a freeze is erroneous—notwithstanding\nthe weighty burden it imposes on the defendants’ ability to\nhire a chosen lawyer—only when the grand jury should\nnever have issued the indictment.\n   The Mathews test’s remaining prong—critical when the\ngovernmental and private interests both have weight—\nthus boils down to the “probable value, if any,” of a judicial\nhearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury findings of\nprobable cause. 424 U. S., at 335. The Kaleys (and the\ndissent) contend that such proceedings will serve an im-\nportant remedial function because grand juries hear only a\n“one-sided presentation[ ]” of evidence. Brief for Petition-\ners 57; see post, at 16. And that argument rests on a\ngenerally sound premise: that the adversarial process\nleads to better, more accurate decision-making. But in\nthis context—when the legal standard is merely probable\ncause and the grand jury has already made that finding—\n18                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nboth our precedents and other courts’ experience indicate\nthat a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit.\n   This Court has repeatedly declined to require the use of\nadversarial procedures to make probable cause determina-\ntions. Probable cause, we have often told litigants, is not a\nhigh bar: It requires only the “kind of ‘fair probability’ on\nwhich ‘reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal techni-\ncians, act.’ ” Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. __, __ (2013) (slip\nop., at 5) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231, 238\n(1983)); see Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 121 (contrasting proba-\nble cause to reasonable-doubt and preponderance stand-\nards). That is why a grand jury’s finding of probable cause\nto think that a person committed a crime “can be [made]\nreliably without an adversary hearing,” id., at 120; it is\nand “has always been thought sufficient to hear only the\nprosecutor’s side,” United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36,\n51 (1992). So, for example, we have held the “confronta-\ntion and cross-examination” of witnesses unnecessary in a\ngrand jury proceeding. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 121–122.\nSimilarly, we have declined to require the presentation of\nexculpatory evidence, see Williams, 504 U. S., at 51, and\nwe have allowed the introduction of hearsay alone, see\nCostello, 350 U. S., at 362–364. On each occasion, we\nrelied on the same reasoning, stemming from our recogni-\ntion that probable cause served only a gateway function:\nGiven the relatively undemanding “nature of the determi-\nnation,” the value of requiring any additional “formalities\nand safeguards” would “[i]n most cases . . . be too slight.”\nGerstein, 420 U. S., at 121–122.\n   We can come out no differently here. The probable\ncause determinations the Kaleys contest are simply those\nunderlying the charges in the indictment. No doubt the\nKaleys could seek to poke holes in the evidence the Gov-\nernment offered the grand jury to support those allega-\ntions. No doubt, too, the Kaleys could present evidence of\ntheir own, which might cast the Government’s in a differ-\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

(Presumably, the Kaleys would try in those two\nways to show that they did not steal, but instead lawfully\nobtained the medical devices they later resold. See supra,\nat 4.) Our criminal justice system of course relies on such\ncontestation at trial when the question becomes whether a\ndefendant is guilty beyond peradventure. But as we have\nheld before, an adversarial process is far less useful to the\nthreshold finding of probable cause, which determines\nonly whether adequate grounds exist to proceed to trial\nand reach that question. The probable cause decision, by\nits nature, is hard to undermine, and still harder to re-\nverse. So the likelihood that a judge holding an eviden-\ntiary hearing will repudiate the grand jury’s decision\nstrikes us, once more, as “too slight” to support a constitu-\ntional requirement. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 122.\n   The evidence from other courts corroborates that view,\nover and over and over again. In the past two decades, the\ncourts in several Circuits have routinely held the kind of\nhearing the Kaleys seek. See supra, at 3, and n. 4. Yet\nneither the Kaleys nor their amici (mostly lawyers’ associ-\nations) have found a single case in which a judge found an\nabsence of probable cause to believe that an indicted de-\nfendant committed the crime charged. One amicus cites\n25 reported cases involving pre-trial hearings on asset\nfreezes. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Law-\nyers 4, n. 2. In 24 of those, the defendant lost outright.\nThe last involved a not-yet-indicted defendant (so no\ngrand jury finding); there, the District Court’s ruling for\nhim was reversed on appeal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, 36.\nTo be sure, a kind of selection bias might affect those\nstatistics: Perhaps a prosecutor with a very weak case\nwould choose to abandon an asset freeze rather than face a\ndifficult hearing. See id., at 16, 37. But the Kaleys and\ntheir amici have also failed to offer any anecdotes of that\nkind; and we suspect that the far more common reason a\nprosecutor relinquishes a freeze is just to avoid premature\n20                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovery. See supra, at 14–15. So experience, as far as\nanyone has discerned it, cuts against the Kaleys: It con-\nfirms that even under Mathews, they have no right to\nrevisit the grand jury’s finding.14\n                             IV\n   When we decided Monsanto, we effectively resolved this\ncase too. If the question in a pre-trial forfeiture case is\nwhether there is probable cause to think the defendant\ncommitted the crime alleged, then the answer is: whatever\nthe grand jury decides. And even if we test that proposi-\ntion by applying Mathews, we arrive at the same place: In\nconsidering such findings of probable cause, we have never\nthought the value of enhanced evidentiary procedures\nworth their costs. Congress of course may strike its own\nbalance and give defendants like the Kaleys the kind of\nhearing they want. Indeed, Congress could disapprove of\nMonsanto itself and hold pre-trial seizures of property to a\nhigher standard than probable cause. But the Due Pro-\n——————\n  14 As against all this—all we have formerly held and all other courts\n\nhave actually found—the dissent cites nothing: not a single decision of\nours suggesting, nor a single decision of a lower court demonstrating,\nthat formal, adversarial procedures are at all likely to correct any\ngrand jury errors. The dissent argues only that a hearing will have\n“probable value” for the Kaleys because “the deprivation of [their]\nright” to chosen counsel, once accomplished, is “effectively permanent.”\nPost, at 16. But that argument confuses two different parts of the\nMathews inquiry. The dissent’s point well underscores the importance\nof the Kaleys’ interest: As we have readily acknowledged, if the grand\njury made a mistake, the Kaleys have suffered a serious injury, which\ncannot later be corrected. See supra, at 16–17. (We note, though, that\nthe dissent, in asserting that injury’s uniqueness, understates the\nlosses that always attend a mistaken indictment, which no ultimate\nverdict can erase.) But the dissent’s argument about what is at stake\nfor the Kaleys says nothing about the crucial, last prong of Mathews,\nwhich asks whether and to what extent the adversarial procedures they\nrequest will in fact correct any grand jury errors.

He might\nreadily give all he owns to defend himself.\n  We have held, however, that the Government may\neffectively remove a defendant’s primary weapon of\ndefense—the attorney he selects and trusts—by freezing\nassets he needs to pay his lawyer. That ruling is not at\nissue. But today the Court goes further, holding that a\ndefendant may be hobbled in this way without an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the Government’s decision to freeze\nthose needed assets. I cannot subscribe to that holding\nand respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  The facts of this case are important. They highlight the\nsignificance to a defendant of being able to hire his counsel\nof choice, and the potential for unfairness inherent in\ngiving the prosecutor the discretion to take that right\naway. Kerri Kaley worked as a sales representative for a\nJohnson & Johnson subsidiary, selling prescription medi-\ncal devices. Kaley and other sales representatives occa-\nsionally obtained outmoded or surplus devices from staff\n2                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmembers at the medical facilities they served, when, for\nexample, those devices were no longer needed because\nthey had been superseded by newer models. Kaley sold\nthe unwanted devices to a Florida company, dividing the\nproceeds among the sales representatives.\n   Kaley learned in January 2005 that a federal grand jury\nwas investigating those activities as a conspiracy to sell\nstolen prescription medical devices. Kaley and her hus-\nband (who allegedly helped ship the products to Florida)\nretained counsel, who immediately set to work preparing\ntheir defense against any impending charges. Counsel\nregularly discussed the investigation with the Kaleys,\nhelped review documents demanded by the grand jury,\nand met with prosecutors in an attempt to ward off an\nindictment. Nonetheless preparing for the worst, the\nKaleys applied for a $500,000 equity line of credit on their\nhome to pay estimated legal fees associated with a trial.\nThey used that money to purchase a $500,000 certificate of\ndeposit, which they set aside until it would be needed to\npay their attorneys for the trial.\n   In February 2007, the grand jury returned a seven-\ncount indictment charging the Kaleys and another sales\nrepresentative, Jennifer Gruenstrass, with violations of\nfederal law. The indictment alleged that a “money judg-\nment” of over $2 million and the $500,000 certificate of\ndeposit were subject to forfeiture under 18 U. S. C.\n§981(a)(1)(C) because those assets constituted “proceeds”\nof the alleged crimes. Armed with this indictment, the\nprosecution obtained an ex parte order pursuant to 21\nU. S. C. §853(e), thereby freezing all of the Kaleys’ assets\nlisted in the indictment, including the certificate of deposit\nset aside for legal fees. The Government did not seek to\nfreeze any of Gruenstrass’s assets.\n   The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, requesting a\nhearing at which they could argue that there was no prob-\nable cause to believe their assets were forfeitable, because\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntheir alleged conduct was not criminal. They argued they\nwere entitled to such a hearing because the restraining\norder targeted funds they needed and had set aside to\nretain for trial the same counsel who had been preparing\ntheir defense for two years. And they contended that the\nprosecution was baseless because the Government could\nnot identify anyone who claimed ownership of the medical\ndevices alleged to have been “stolen.” During a telephone\nconference with a Magistrate Judge on the motion, the\nprosecution conceded that it had been able to trace only\n$140,000 in allegedly criminal proceeds to the Kaleys,\nwhich led the Magistrate Judge to question the lawfulness\nof restraining the listed assets.\n   Just two business days after that conference, the Gov-\nernment obtained a superseding indictment that added a\ncount of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18\nU. S. C. §1956(h). Adding that charge enabled the Gov-\nernment to proceed under a much broader forfeiture provi-\nsion than the one in the original indictment. While the\ncivil forfeiture provision in §981(a)(1)(C) authorized forfeit-\nure of property that “constitutes or is derived from pro-\nceeds traceable to” a qualifying criminal violation, the\ncriminal forfeiture provision now invoked by the Govern-\nment—§982(a)(1)—authorizes forfeiture of property “in-\nvolved in” a qualifying offense, or “any property traceable\nto such property.” The superseding indictment alleged\nthat a sum of more than $2 million, the certificate of de-\nposit reserved to pay legal expenses, and now the Kaleys’\nhome were subject to forfeiture. And again, the Govern-\nment sought an order freezing substantially all those\nassets.\n   The Kaleys objected, repeating the arguments they had\npreviously raised, and also contending that the prosecu-\ntors were being vindictive in adding the money laundering\ncharge and seeking broader forfeiture. The District Court\nnonetheless entered the broader order requested by the\n4                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nGovernment, and the restraint on the Kaleys’ assets re-\nmains in place.\n  While the Kaleys’ appeal from that denial was pending,\nthe Government proceeded to trial separately against\ntheir codefendant Gruenstrass. As the Government had\nnot sought to freeze Gruenstrass’s assets, she was repre-\nsented by her chosen counsel. Her counsel argued that the\nGovernment was pitching a fraud without a victim, be-\ncause no Government witness took the stand to claim\nownership of the allegedly stolen devices. The jury acquit-\nted Gruenstrass on all charges in less than three hours—a\ngood omen for the Kaleys and their counsel as they pre-\npared for their own trial.\n                              II\n   The issues at stake here implicate fundamental consti-\ntutional principles. The Sixth Amendment provides that\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\nright . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his de-\nfence.” In many ways, this is the most precious right a\ndefendant has, because it is his attorney who will fight for\nthe other rights the defendant enjoys. United States v.\nCronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653–654 (1984). And more than 80\nyears ago, we found it “hardly necessary to say that, the\nright to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be\nafforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own\nchoice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932).\n   Indeed, we recently called the “right to select counsel of\none’s choice . . . . the root meaning of the constitutional\nguarantee” of the Sixth Amendment. United States v.\nGonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147–148 (2006). The\nAmendment requires “that a particular guarantee of fair-\nness be provided—to wit, that the accused be defended\nby the counsel he believes to be best.” Id., at 146. An\nindividual’s right to counsel of choice is violated “whenever\nthe defendant’s choice is wrongfully denied,” and such\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    5\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nerror “pervades the entire trial.” Id., at 150. A violation of\nthis right is therefore a “structural error,” ibid.; that\nis, one of the very few kinds of errors that “undermine\nthe fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole.” United\nStates v. Davila, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12).\n   It is of course true that the right to counsel of choice is\n(like most rights) not absolute. A defendant has no right\nto choose counsel he cannot afford, counsel who is not\na member of the bar, or counsel with an impermissible\nconflict of interest. Wheat v. United States, 486 U. S. 153,\n159 (1988). And a district court need not always shuffle\nits calendar to accommodate a defendant’s preferred coun-\nsel if it has legitimate reasons not to do so. Morris v.\nSlappy, 461 U. S. 1, 11–12 (1983). But none of those\nlimitations is imposed at the unreviewable discretion of a\nprosecutor—the party who wants the defendant to lose at\ntrial.\n   This Court has held that the prosecution may freeze\nassets a defendant needs to retain his counsel of choice\nupon “a finding of probable cause to believe that the assets\nare forfeitable.” United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600,\n615 (1989). The Kaleys do not challenge that holding\nhere. But the Court in Monsanto acknowledged and re-\nserved the crucial question whether a defendant had the\nright to be heard before the Government could take such\naction. Id., at 615, n. 10.1\n   There was good reason for that caution. The possibility\nthat a prosecutor could elect to hamstring his target by\npreventing him from paying his counsel of choice raises\nsubstantial concerns about the fairness of the entire pro-\nceeding. “A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic require-\n——————\n  1 Because the District Court in Monsanto had imposed the restraining\n\norder after an “extensive, 4-day hearing on the question of probable\ncause,” it was “pointless” for this Court to decide whether a hearing was\nrequired to “adequately establish[ ]” probable cause. 491 U. S., at 615,\nn. 10, 616.\n6                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nment of due process.” In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136\n(1955). Issues concerning the denial of counsel of choice\nimplicate the overall fairness of the trial because they\n“bear[ ] directly on the ‘framework within which the trial\nproceeds.’ ” Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 150 (quoting Arizona\nv. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)).\n                             III\n   Notwithstanding the substantial constitutional issues at\nstake, the majority believes that syllogistic-type reasoning\neffectively resolves this case. Ante, at 12. The majority’s\nreasoning goes like this: First, to freeze assets prior to\ntrial, the Government must show probable cause to believe\nthat a defendant has committed an offense giving rise to\nforfeiture. Second, grand jury determinations of probable\ncause are nonreviewable. Therefore, the Kaleys cannot\n“relitigate [the] grand jury finding” of probable cause to\navoid a pretrial restraint of assets they need to retain\ntheir counsel of choice. Ibid. I do not view the matter as\nnearly so “straightforward,” and neither did the multiple\nCourts of Appeals since Monsanto that have granted\ndefendants the type of hearing the Kaleys request. See\nante, at 3, n. 4.\n   To begin with, the majority’s conclusion is wrong on its\nown terms. To freeze assets prior to trial, the Government\nmust show probable cause to believe both that (1) a de-\nfendant has committed an offense giving rise to forfeiture\nand (2) the targeted assets have the requisite connection\nto the alleged criminal conduct. 21 U. S. C. §853(e)(1)(A).\nThe Solicitor General concedes—and all Courts of Appeals\nto have considered the issue have held—that “defendants\nare entitled to show that the assets that are restrained are\nnot actually the proceeds of the charged criminal offense,”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 45; that is, that the second prong of the\nrequired showing is not satisfied. But by listing prop-\nerty in the indictment and alleging that it is subject to\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nforfeiture—as required to restrain assets before trial under\n§853(e)(1)(A)—the grand jury found probable cause to\nbelieve those assets were linked to the charged offenses,\njust as it found probable cause to believe the Kaleys com-\nmitted the underlying crimes. App. 60–61 (separate in-\ndictment section alleging criminal forfeiture, including of\nthe certificate of deposit); see United States v. Jones, 160\nF. 3d 641, 645 (CA10 1998); United States v. Monsanto,\n924 F. 2d 1186, 1197 (CA2 1991) (en banc); Dept. of Jus-\ntice, Asset Forfeiture Policy Manual 128 (2013) (“That the\nindictment alleges that property is subject to forfeiture\nindicates that the grand jury has made a probable cause\ndetermination.”). Neither the Government nor the major-\nity gives any reason why the District Court may reconsider\nthe grand jury’s probable cause finding as to traceability—\nand in fact constitutionally must, if asked—but may not do\nso as to the underlying charged offenses.2\n   In any event, the hearing the Kaleys seek would not be\nmere relitigation of the grand jury proceedings. At that\nhearing, the District Court would consider the merits of\nthe prosecution to determine whether there is probable\ncause to believe the Kaleys’ assets are forfeitable, not to\ndetermine whether the Kaleys may be tried at all. If the\njudge agrees with the Kaleys, he will merely hold that the\nGovernment has not met its burden at that hearing to\njustify freezing the assets the Kaleys need to pay their\nattorneys. The Government may proceed with the prose-\n\n——————\n   2 The majority’s only response is to characterize the grand jury’s\n\nfinding of traceability as merely a “technical matter.” Ante, at 11, n. 9.\nBut the indictment draws no distinction between the grand jury’s\nfinding of probable cause to believe that the Kaleys committed a crime\nand its finding of probable cause to believe that certain assets are\ntraceable to that crime. Both showings must be made to justify a\npretrial asset restraint under Monsanto, and there is nothing in that\ncase or the indictment that justifies treating one grand jury finding\ndifferently than the other.\n8                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ncution, but the Kaleys will have their chosen counsel at\ntheir side.\n  Even though the probable cause standard applies at\nboth the indictment stage and the pretrial asset restraint\nhearing, the judge’s determination will be based on differ-\nent evidence than that previously presented to the grand\njury. For its part, the Government may choose to put on\nmore or less evidence at the hearing than it did before\nthe grand jury. And of course the Kaleys would have the\nopportunity to tell their side of the story—something the\ngrand jury never hears. See United States v. Williams,\n504 U. S. 36, 51–52 (1992). Here, much of what the\nKaleys want to present comes from Gruenstrass’s trial—\nevidence that the grand jury obviously could not have\nconsidered. So even if the judge determined that probable\ncause to justify the pretrial asset restraint had not been\nadequately established, that determination would not in\nany way amount to “looking into and revising the judg-\nment of the grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose\nof determining whether or not the finding was founded\nupon sufficient proof.” Ante, at 7 (quoting Costello v.\nUnited States, 350 U. S. 359, 362–363 (1956) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). The judge’s decision based\non the evidence presented at the hearing would have no\nnecessary legal or logical consequence for the underlying\nprosecution because it would be based on different evi-\ndence and used for a different purpose.\n  The majority warns that allowing a judge to consider\nthe underlying merits of the prosecution for purposes of\ndetermining whether a defendant’s assets may be re-\nstrained pretrial could create “legal dissonance” with the\ngrand jury’s indictment, which “could not but undermine\nthe criminal justice system’s integrity.” Ante, at 10–11.\nBut as explained, such a judicial finding based on different\nevidence with both sides present would not contradict the\ngrand jury’s probable cause finding based on what was\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nbefore it. That finding would still suffice to accomplish its\npurpose—to call for a trial on the merits of the charges.\nRather than creating “dissonance,” the traditional roles of\nthe principal actors in our justice system would remain\nrespected: The grand jury decides whether a defendant\nshould be required to stand trial, the judge decides pre-\ntrial matters and how the trial should proceed, and the\njury decides whether the defendant is guilty of the crime.\n   Indeed, in the bail context—the pretrial determination\nthat is perhaps the closest analogue to the pretrial re-\nstraint of assets at issue here—we allow judicial inquiries\ninto the underlying merits of the indicted charges, without\nconcern about intruding into the province of the grand\njury. An indictment charging sufficiently serious crimes\ngives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a defend-\nant is not eligible for pretrial release. See 18 U. S. C.\n§§3142(e)(3) and (f). Such a defendant is nonetheless\nentitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he may contest\n(among other things) “the weight of the evidence against”\nhim, §3142(g)(2). Yet no one would say that the district\ncourt encroached on the grand jury’s role if the court de-\ntermined that it would not authorize pretrial detention\nbecause of the weakness of the prosecution’s case. See,\ne.g., United States v. Hurtado, 779 F. 2d 1467, 1479–1480\n(CA11 1985) (recognizing that in considering the “weight\nof the evidence” to decide whether the presumption is\nrebutted, “it may well be necessary to open up the issue of\nprobable cause since that too is a question of evidentiary\nweight”). That makes sense, because the district court has\nconsidered the underlying merits of the charges based on\ndifferent information and for a different purpose than the\ngrand jury did. Such a defendant would be granted pre-\ntrial release, but would still have to show up for trial.3\n——————\n  3 The majority cites cases in which courts have correctly rejected re-\n\nquests for a judicial redetermination of the grand jury’s probable cause\n10                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  In any event, few things could do more to “undermine\nthe criminal justice system’s integrity,” ante, at 11, than to\nallow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then,\nat its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent\nby depriving him of his counsel of choice—without even an\nopportunity to be heard. That is the result of the Court’s\ndecision in this case, and it is fundamentally at odds with\nour constitutional tradition and basic notions of fair play.\n                            IV\n  The majority is no more persuasive in applying the due\nprocess balancing test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319 (1976).4 As an initial matter, the majority\n——————\nfinding for purposes of determining whether the rebuttable presumption\nof pretrial detention is triggered. See ante, at 8–9, n. 6. But those\ncases do not question the judge’s authority to consider the underlying\nmerits of the Government’s case (including what the grand jury has\nalleged in the indictment) for purposes of determining whether that\npresumption has been rebutted. E.g., United States v. Dominguez, 783\nF. 2d 702, 706 (CA7 1986) (“evidence probative of guilt is admitted at\na detention hearing only to support or challenge the weight of the gov-\nernment’s case against the defendant”); see also United States v. Jones,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2499462\"><a href=\"/nysd/dP1b/united-states-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (SDNY 2008) (releasing a defendant pretrial\nafter determining that “the weight of the evidence now overcomes the\npresumption of detention”). The majority notes that this inquiry in the\nbail context is authorized by statute, but that does not alter the crucial\npoint: Where the prosecutor seeks to use the indictment to impose\nanother significant pretrial consequence on a defendant, judges are\nallowed to inquire into the underlying merits of the prosecution (includ-\ning the very same matters the grand jury has considered) as part of the\ninquiry into whether that consequence is justified, and that has not\nresulted in “dissonance” or the undermining of the grand jury’s role.\n   4 Under our due process precedents, it is clear that the Mathews test\n\napplies in this case, rather than the inquiry set forth in Medina v.\nCalifornia, 505 U. S. 437 (1992). We held in Medina that Mathews is\ninapplicable when “assessing the validity of state procedural rules” that\n“are part of the criminal process.” Id., at 443. We have therefore\napplied Medina rather than Mathews only when considering such due\nprocess challenges, including, for example, the allocation of burdens of\nproof or what type of evidence may be admitted. See, e.g., id., at 443–\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngives short shrift to the Kaleys’ interests at stake. “The\npresumption of innocence, although not articulated in the\nConstitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our\nsystem of criminal justice.” Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S.\n501, 503 (1976). Whatever serious crimes the grand jury\nalleges the Kaleys committed, they are presumptively\ninnocent of those charges until final judgment. Their right\nto vindicate that presumption by choosing the advocate\nthey believe will best defend them is, as explained, at the\nvery core of the Sixth Amendment.\n  I suspect that, for the Kaleys, that right could hardly be\nmore precious than it is now. In addition to potentially\nlosing the property the Government has already frozen—\nincluding their home—the Kaleys face maximum prison\nterms of five years (18 U. S. C. §371), ten years (§2314),\nand 20 years (§1956(h)) for the charges in the superseding\nindictment. The indictment means they must stand trial\non those charges. But the Kaleys plainly have an urgent\ninterest in having their chosen counsel—who has worked\nwith them since the grand jury’s investigation began, two\nyears before the indictment—mount their best possible\ndefense at trial.\n  The majority alludes to our cases recognizing that in-\ndictments may result in the temporary deprivation of a\ndefendant’s liberty without judicial review, and suggests\nthat indictments therefore must also be “good enough” to\ndeprive a defendant of property without judicial review.\nAnte, at 9–10. Even if this greater-includes-the-lesser\n——————\n446 (burden of proving incompetence to stand trial); Patterson v. New\nYork, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977) (burden of proving affirmative defense);\nDowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990) (admissibility of\ntestimony about a prior crime of which the defendant was acquitted).\nThis case is not about such questions, but about the collateral issue of\nthe pretrial deprivation of property a defendant needs to exercise his\nright to counsel of choice. Mathews therefore provides the relevant\ninquiry.\n12               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreasoning might be valid in other contexts, it is not when\nthe property at issue is needed to hire chosen counsel. In\nthe context of a prosecution for serious crimes, it is far\nfrom clear which interest is greater—the interest in tem-\nporary liberty pending trial, or the interest in using one’s\navailable means to avoid imprisonment for many years\nafter trial. Retaining one’s counsel of choice ensures the\nfundamental fairness of the actual trial, and thus may be\nfar more valuable to a criminal defendant than pretrial\nrelease.\n   As for the Government’s side, the Court echoes the\nGovernment’s concerns that a hearing would place de-\nmands on its resources and interfere with its desire to\nkeep its trial strategy close to the vest. These concerns\nare somewhat curious in light of the majority’s emphasis\non how easy it is to make a probable cause showing. And\nthey are even more surprising in light of the extensive\ndiscovery obligations already imposed on the Government\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 and Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The emphasis the Gov-\nernment places on pretrial secrecy evokes an outdated\nconception of the criminal trial as “a poker game in which\nplayers enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their\ncards until played.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 82\n(1970).\n   Moreover, recall that the Government concedes that due\nprocess guarantees defendants a hearing to contest the\ntraceability of the restrained assets to the charged con-\nduct. If a defendant requests such a hearing, the Gov-\nernment will likely be required to reveal something about\nits case to demonstrate that the assets have the requisite\nconnection to the charged offenses.\n   In any event, these concerns are exaggerated. What the\nGovernment would be required to show in a pretrial re-\nstraint hearing is similar to pretrial showings prosecutors\nmake in other contexts on a daily basis. As mentioned\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C.

See\nBrief for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 11–18. The Government makes similar\nshowings in the context of other pretrial motions, such\nas motions to admit hearsay evidence under the co-\nconspirator exception, or to discover attorney-client com-\nmunications made in furtherance of a future crime. Id., at\n19–28.\n  In those contexts, as in this one, the decision how much\nto “show its hand” rests fully within the Government’s\ndiscretion. If it has a strong case and believes that pretrial\nrestraint is necessary to preserve the assets for forfeit-\nure, the Government may choose to make a strong evi-\ndentiary showing and have little concern about doing so.\nIn a closer case, where the Government is more concerned\nabout tipping its hand, it may elect to forgo a pretrial\nrestraint of those assets the defendant needs to pay his\ncounsel. I see no great burden on the Government in\nallowing it to strike this balance as it sees fit when consid-\nering a pretrial asset restraint that would deprive a de-\nfendant of his right to counsel of choice. In the end, it is a\nbit much to argue that the Government has discretion to\ndeprive a defendant—without a hearing—of the counsel he\nhas chosen to present his defense, simply to avoid the\nmere possibility of a premature peek at some aspect of\nwhat the Government intends to do at trial.\n  The majority also significantly underestimates the\namount of control judges can exercise in these types of\nhearings. The Circuits that allow such hearings have\nafforded judges a great deal of flexibility in structuring\nthem. Judges need not apply the Federal Rules of Evi-\ndence during the hearings, and they can take many steps,\nincluding in camera proceedings, to ensure that witness\n14               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsafety and grand jury secrecy are fully preserved. See\nMonsanto, 924 F. 2d, at 1198; United States v. E-Gold,\nLtd., 521 F. 3d 411, 418–419 (CADC 2008).\n   Moreover, experience in the Second Circuit, where\ndefendants have for more than 20 years been afforded the\ntype of hearing the Kaleys seek, indicates that such hear-\nings do not occur so often as to raise substantial concerns\nabout taxing the resources of the Government and lower\ncourts. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Law-\nyers as Amicus Curiae 4–9. As the majority notes, only 25\nreported cases appear to have addressed such hearings.\nId., at 4. This relative rarity is unsurprising. To even be\nentitled to the hearing, defendants must first show a\ngenuine need to use the assets to retain counsel of choice.\nSee United States v. Bonventre, 720 F. 3d 126, 131 (CA2\n2013). And defendants too have an incentive not to tip\ntheir hands as to trial strategy—perhaps to an even greater\nextent than the Government, given that defendants bear\ncomparatively few discovery obligations at a criminal\ntrial. In light of the low bar of the probable cause stand-\nard, many defendants likely conclude that the possible\nbenefits of the hearing are not worth the candle.\n   For those hearings that do occur, they are by all appear-\nances ably controlled by district judges to keep them man-\nageable and to limit the potential for excess or abuse. See\nBrief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as Amicus\nCuriae 6–8. In addition, where such hearings are allowed,\nprosecutors and defense counsel often reach agreements\nconcerning the scope and conditions of any protective\norder that accommodate the interests of both sides. See\nid., at 8–9. When the right at stake is as fundamental as\nhiring one’s counsel of choice—the “root meaning” of the\nSixth Amendment, Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 147–\n148—the Government’s interest in saving the time and\nexpense of a limited number of such proceedings is not\nparticularly compelling.\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The Government does have legitimate interests that are\nserved by forfeiture of allegedly tainted assets. Caplin &\nDrysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 629\n(1989). And imposing a pretrial restraint on such assets\ndoes increase the likelihood that they will be available if\nthe defendant is convicted.5 But that interest is protected\nin other ways that mitigate the concern that defendants\nwill successfully divert forfeitable assets from the Gov-\nernment’s reach if afforded a hearing. The relation-back\nprovision in 21 U. S. C. §853(c) provides that title to for-\nfeitable assets, once adjudged forfeitable, vests in the\nGovernment as of the time the offense was committed.\nSection 853(c) then provides that the Government may\nseek a “special verdict of forfeiture” as to any forfeited\nproperty that was subsequently transferred to a third\nparty. The Government protests that recovery of such\nassets will often be complicated and subject to the vagar-\nies of state law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–50. But such com-\nplaints of administrative inconvenience carry little weight\nin this particular context, when the Government knows\nexactly where the money has gone: to an attorney who is,\nafter all, an officer of the court, and on notice that the\nGovernment claims title to the assets.\n   And we are not talking about all of a defendant’s assets\nthat are subject to forfeiture—only those that the defend-\nant can show are necessary to secure his counsel of choice.\n——————\n  5 The Government and the majority place particular emphasis on the\nuse of forfeited assets to provide restitution to victims of crime. See\nBrief for United States 41–42, and n. 14; ante, at 2, n. 1. It is worth\nnoting in this respect that in prosecuting the other sales representa-\ntives that participated with the Kaleys in the allegedly fraudulent\nconduct, the Government’s position as to who exactly is the “victim” has\nshifted frequently. See Brief for Petitioners 9–11 (hospitals); id., at 18,\n21–23 (their employers); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43–44 (hospitals). As one\nprosecutor forthrightly acknowledged at the sentencing hearing of an\nalleged co-conspirator, “we can’t make restitution.” Brief for Petition-\ners 11.\n16               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nHere, for example, the Kaleys have identified as needed to\npay counsel only a discrete portion of the assets the Gov-\nernment seeks. The statistics cited by the Court on the\ntotal amount of assets recovered by the Government and\nprovided as restitution for victims, ante, at 2, n. 1, are\ncompletely beside the point.\n   The majority ultimately concludes that a pretrial hear-\ning of the sort the Kaleys seek would be a waste of time.\nAnte, at 17–20. No. It takes little imagination to see that\nseizures based entirely on ex parte proceedings create a\nheightened risk of error. Common sense tells us that\nsecret decisions based on only one side of the story will\nprove inaccurate more often than those made after hear-\ning from both sides. We have thus consistently recognized\nthat the “fundamental instrument for judicial judgment” is\n“an adversary proceeding in which both parties may par-\nticipate.” Carroll v. President and Comm’rs of Princess\nAnne, 393 U. S. 175, 183 (1968). In the present context,\nsome defendants (like the Kaleys) may be able to show\nthat the theory of prosecution is legally defective through\nan argument that almost certainly was not presented to\nthe grand jury. And as discussed above, supra, at 13–15,\nprosecutors in some cases elect not to freeze needed assets,\nor they negotiate tailored protective orders to serve the\ninterests of both sides—something they would be unlikely\nto do if the hearings were rote exercises.\n   Given the risk of an erroneous restraint of assets needed\nto retain chosen counsel, the “probable value” of the “addi-\ntional safeguard” a pretrial hearing would provide is\nsignificant. That is because the right to counsel of choice\nis inherently transient, and the deprivation of that right\neffectively permanent. In our cases suggesting that little\nwould be gained by requiring an adversary hearing on\nprobable cause or imposing stricter evidentiary require-\nments in grand jury proceedings, we have noted that the\ngrand jury is not where the ultimate question of “the guilt\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nor innocence of the accused is adjudicated.” United States\nv. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343 (1974); see United States\nv. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 51 (1992) (explaining that the\ngrand jury hears only from the prosecutor because “ ‘the\nfinding of an indictment is only in the nature of an en-\nquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be tried and\ndetermined’ ” (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 300\n(1769)). If the grand jury considers incomplete or incom-\npetent evidence in deciding to return an indictment, the\ndefendant still has the full trial on the merits, with all its\n“formalities and safeguards,” Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S.\n103, 122 (1975), to prove his innocence.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government seeks to use the\ngrand jury’s probable cause determination to strip the\nKaleys of their counsel of choice. The Kaleys can take no\ncomfort that they will be able to vindicate that right in a\nfuture adversarial proceeding. Once trial begins with\nsomeone other than chosen counsel, the right is lost, and it\ncannot be restored based on what happens at trial. “The\nfundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity\nto be heard ‘at a meaningful time and in a meaningful\nmanner.’ ” Mathews, 424 U. S., at 333 (quoting Armstrong\nv. Manzo, 380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965)). If the Kaleys are to\nhave any opportunity to meaningfully challenge that\ndeprivation, they must have it before the trial begins.\n                       *   *     *\n   The issues presented here implicate some of the most\nfundamental precepts underlying the American criminal\njustice system. A person accused by the United States of\ncommitting a crime is presumed innocent until proven\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But he faces a foe of\npowerful might and vast resources, intent on seeing him\nbehind bars. That individual has the right to choose the\nadvocate he believes will most ably defend his liberty at\ntrial.\n18                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The trial is governed by rules designed to ensure that,\nwhatever the ultimate verdict, we can be confident to the\nextent possible that justice was done, within the bounds of\nthe Constitution. That confidence is grounded in our\nbelief in the adversary system. “The very premise of our\nadversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advo-\ncacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate\nobjective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go\nfree.” Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 862 (1975).\nToday’s decision erodes that confidence by permitting\nthe Government to deprive a criminal defendant of his right\nto counsel of choice, without so much as a chance to be\nheard on why such a significant pretrial deprivation is\nunwarranted.\n   The majority wraps up its analysis by blandly noting\nthat Congress is of course free to extend broader protec-\ntion to criminal defendants. Ante, at 20. Not very likely.\nIn this area it is to the courts that those charged with\ncrime must turn.\n   Federal prosecutors, when they rise in court, represent\nthe people of the United States. But so do defense lawyers—\none at a time. In my view, the Court’s opinion pays\ninsufficient respect to the importance of an independent\nbar as a check on prosecutorial abuse and government\noverreaching. Granting the Government the power to take\naway a defendant’s chosen advocate strikes at the heart of\nthat significant role. I would not do it, and so respectfully\ndissent.\n</pre>", "id": 2654756, "judges": "", "local_path": "pdf/2014/02/25/kaley_v._united_states_1.pdf", "nature_of_suit": "", "plain_text": "(Slip Opinion)              OCTOBER TERM, 2013                                       1\n\n                                       Syllabus\n\n         NOTE: Where it is feasible, a syllabus (headnote) will be released, as is\n       being done in connection with this case, at the time the opinion is issued.\n       The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been\n       prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.\n       See United States v.

C. §853(e)(1) empowers courts to enter pre-trial restrain-\n  ing orders to “preserve the availability of [forfeitable] property” while\n  criminal proceedings are pending. Such pre-trial asset restraints are\n  constitutionally permissible whenever probable cause exists to think\n  that a defendant has committed an offense permitting forfeiture and\n  that the assets in dispute are traceable or otherwise sufficiently re-\n  lated to the crime charged. United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600.\n     After a grand jury indicted petitioners, Kerri and Brian Kaley, for\n  reselling stolen medical devices and laundering the proceeds, the\n  Government obtained a §853(e)(1) restraining order against their as-\n  sets. The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, intending to use a por-\n  tion of the disputed assets for their legal fees. The District Court al-\n  lowed them to challenge the assets’ traceability to the offenses in\n  question but not the facts supporting the underlying indictment. The\n  Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: When challenging the legality of a §853(e)(1) pre-trial asset sei-\n zure, a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitution-\n ally entitled to contest a grand jury’s determination of probable cause\n to believe the defendant committed the crimes charged. Pp. 5–21.\n    (a) In Monsanto, this Court held that the Government may seize\n assets before trial that a defendant intends to use to pay an attorney,\n so long as probable cause exists “to believe that the property will ul-\n timately be proved forfeitable.” 491 U. S., at 615. The question\n whether indicted defendants like the Kaleys are constitutionally enti-\n tled to a judicial re-determination of the grand jury’s probable cause\n conclusion in a hearing to lift an asset restraint has a ready answer\n in the fundamental and historic commitment of the criminal justice\n system to entrust probable cause findings to a grand jury. A probable\n2                       KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    cause finding sufficient to initiate a prosecution for a serious crime is\n    “conclusive[e],” Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 117, n. 19, and, as a\n    general matter, “a challenge to the reliability or competence of the ev-\n    idence” supporting that finding “will not be heard,” United States v.\n    Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 54. A grand jury’s probable cause finding\n    may, on its own, effect a pre-trial restraint on a person’s liberty. Ger-\n    stein, 420 U. S., at 117, n. 19. The same result follows when it works\n    to restrain a defendant’s property.\n       The Kaleys’ alternative rule would have strange and destructive\n    consequences. Allowing a judge to decide anew what the grand jury\n    has already determined could result in two inconsistent findings gov-\n    erning different aspects of one criminal proceeding, with the same\n    judge who found probable cause lacking presiding over a trial prem-\n    ised on its existence. That legal dissonance could not but undermine\n    the criminal justice system’s integrity, especially the grand jury’s\n    constitutional role. Pp. 5–12.\n       (b) The balancing test of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319—\n    which requires a court to weigh (1) the burdens that a requested pro-\n    cedure would impose on the government against (2) the private inter-\n    est at stake, as viewed alongside (3) “the risk of an erroneous depri-\n    vation” of that interest without the procedure and “the probable\n    value, if any, of [the] additional . . . procedural safeguar[d],” id., at\n    335—if applicable here, tips against the Kaleys. Because the Gov-\n    ernment’s interest in freezing potentially forfeitable assets without\n    an adversarial hearing about the probable cause underlying criminal\n    charges and the Kaleys’ interest in retaining counsel of their own\n    choosing are both substantial, the test’s third prong is critical. It\n    boils down to the “probable value, if any,” of a judicial hearing in un-\n    covering mistaken grand jury probable cause findings. But when the\n    legal standard is merely probable cause and the grand jury has al-\n    ready made that finding, a full-dress hearing will provide little bene-\n    fit. See Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. ___, ___. A finding of probable\n    cause to think that a person committed a crime “can be [made] relia-\n    bly without an adversary hearing,” Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 120, and\n    the value of requiring additional “formalities and safeguards” would\n    “[i]n most cases . . . be too slight,” id., at 121–122. The experience of\n    several Circuits corroborates this view. Neither the Kaleys nor their\n    amici point to a single case in two decades where courts, holding\n    hearings of the kind they seek, have found the absence of probable\n    cause to believe that an indicted defendant committed the crime\n    charged.

S. C. §853(e), authorizes a court\nto freeze an indicted defendant’s assets prior to trial if\nthey would be subject to forfeiture upon conviction. In\nUnited States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 615 (1989), we\napproved the constitutionality of such an order so long as\nit is “based on a finding of probable cause to believe that\nthe property will ultimately be proved forfeitable.” And\nwe held that standard to apply even when a defendant\nseeks to use the disputed property to pay for a lawyer.\n   In this case, two indicted defendants wishing to hire an\nattorney challenged a pre-trial restraint on their property.\nThe trial court convened a hearing to consider the sei-\nzure’s legality under Monsanto. The question presented is\nwhether criminal defendants are constitutionally entitled\nat such a hearing to contest a grand jury’s prior determi-\nnation of probable cause to believe they committed the\ncrimes charged. We hold that they have no right to reliti-\ngate that finding.\n2                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n   Criminal forfeitures are imposed upon conviction to\nconfiscate assets used in or gained from certain serious\ncrimes. See 21 U. S. C. §853(a). Forfeitures help to en-\nsure that crime does not pay: They at once punish wrong-\ndoing, deter future illegality, and “lessen the economic\npower” of criminal enterprises. Caplin & Drysdale, Char-\ntered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 630 (1989); see id., at\n634 (“Forfeiture provisions are powerful weapons in the\nwar on crime”). The Government also uses forfeited prop-\nerty to recompense victims of crime, improve conditions in\ncrime-damaged communities, and support law enforce-\nment activities like police training. See id., at 629–630.1\nAccordingly, “there is a strong governmental interest in\nobtaining full recovery of all forfeitable assets.” Id., at\n631.\n   In line with that interest, §853(e)(1) empowers courts to\nenter pre-trial restraining orders or injunctions to “pre-\nserve the availability of [forfeitable] property” while crim-\ninal proceedings are pending. Such an order, issued\n“[u]pon application of the United States,” prevents a de-\nfendant from spending or transferring specified property,\nincluding to pay an attorney for legal services. Ibid. In\nMonsanto, our principal case involving this procedure, we\nheld a pre-trial asset restraint constitutionally permissible\nwhenever there is probable cause to believe that the property\nis forfeitable.

See §853(a).\nThe Monsanto Court, however, declined to consider\n“whether the Due Process Clause requires a hearing” to\nestablish either or both of those aspects of forfeitability.\nId., at 615, n. 10.2\n  Since Monsanto, the lower courts have generally pro-\nvided a hearing to any indicted defendant seeking to lift an\nasset restraint to pay for a lawyer. In that hearing, they\nhave uniformly allowed the defendant to litigate the sec-\nond issue stated above: whether probable cause exists to\nbelieve that the assets in dispute are traceable or other-\nwise sufficiently related to the crime charged in the in-\ndictment.3 But the courts have divided over extending the\nhearing to the first issue. Some have considered, while\nothers have barred, a defendant’s attempt to challenge the\nprobable cause underlying a criminal charge.4 This case\nraises the question whether an indicted defendant has a\nconstitutional right to contest the grand jury’s prior de-\ntermination of that matter.\n——————\n   2 The forfeiture statute itself requires a hearing when the Govern-\n\nment seeks to restrain the assets of someone who has not yet been\nindicted. See 21 U. S. C. §853(e)(1)(B). That statutory provision is not\nat issue in this case, which involves a pair of indicted defendants.\n   3 At oral argument, the Government agreed that a defendant has a\n\nconstitutional right to a hearing on that question.

The indictment accused petitioner Kerri\nKaley, a sales representative for a subsidiary of Johnson &\nJohnson, and petitioner Brian Kaley, her husband, with\ntransporting stolen medical devices across state lines and\nlaundering the proceeds of that activity.5 The Kaleys have\ncontested those allegations throughout this litigation,\narguing that the medical devices at issue were unwanted,\nexcess hospital inventory, which they could lawfully take\nand market to others.\n  Immediately after obtaining the indictment, the Gov-\nernment sought a restraining order under §853(e)(1) to\nprevent the Kaleys from transferring any assets traceable\nto or involved in the alleged offenses. Included among\nthose assets is a $500,000 certificate of deposit that the\nKaleys intended to use for legal fees. The District Court\nentered the requested order. Later, in response to the\nKaleys’ motion to vacate the asset restraint, the court\ndenied a request for an evidentiary hearing and confirmed\nthe order, except as to $63,000 that it found (based on the\nparties’ written submissions) was not connected to the\nalleged offenses.\n  On interlocutory appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed\nand remanded for further consideration of whether some\nkind of evidentiary hearing was warranted. See 579 F. 3d\n1246 (2009). The District Court then concluded that it\nshould hold a hearing, but only as to “whether the re-\n——————\n  5An earlier version of the indictment did not include the money laun-\n\ndering charge. In its superseding indictment, the Government also\naccused Jennifer Gruenstrass, another sales representative, of trans-\nporting stolen property and money laundering. Her case went to trial,\nand she was acquitted. Several other sales representatives participat-\ning in the Kaleys’ activity entered guilty pleas (each to a charge of\nshipping stolen goods) during the Government’s investigation.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstrained assets are traceable to or involved in the alleged\ncriminal conduct.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 43, n. 5. The\nKaleys informed the court that they no longer disputed\nthat issue; they wished to show only that the “case against\nthem is ‘baseless.’ ” Id., at 39; see App. 107 (“We are not\ncontesting that the assets restrained were . . . traceable to\nthe conduct. Our quarrel is whether that conduct consti-\ntutes a crime”). Accordingly, the District Court affirmed\nthe restraining order, and the Kaleys took another appeal.\nThe Eleventh Circuit this time affirmed, holding that the\nKaleys were not entitled at a hearing on the asset freeze\n“to challenge the factual foundation supporting the grand\njury’s probable cause determination[ ]”—that is, “the very\nvalidity of the underlying indictment.” 677 F. 3d 1316,\n1317 (2012).\n  We granted certiorari in light of the Circuit split on the\nquestion presented, 568 U. S. ___ (2013), and we now affirm\nthe Eleventh Circuit.\n                               II\n  This Court has twice considered claims, similar to the\nKaleys’, that the Fifth Amendment’s right to due process\nand the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel constrain the\nway the federal forfeiture statute applies to assets needed\nto retain an attorney. See Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U. S.\n617; Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600. We begin with those rul-\nings not as mere background, but as something much\nmore. On the single day the Court decided both those\ncases, it cast the die on this one too.\n  In Caplin & Drysdale, we considered whether the Fifth\nand Sixth Amendments exempt from forfeiture money that\na convicted defendant has agreed to pay his attorney. See\n491 U. S., at 623–635. We conceded a factual premise of\nthe constitutional claim made in the case: Sometimes “a\ndefendant will be unable to retain the attorney of his\nchoice,” if he cannot use forfeitable assets. Id., at 625.\n6                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStill, we held, the defendant’s claim was “untenable.” Id.,\nat 626. “A defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to\nspend another person’s money” for legal fees—even if that\nis the only way to hire a preferred lawyer. Ibid. Consider,\nwe submitted, the example of a “robbery suspect” who\nwishes to “use funds he has stolen from a bank to retain\nan attorney to defend him if he is apprehended.” Ibid.\nThat money is “not rightfully his.” Ibid. Accordingly, we\nconcluded, the Government does not violate the Constitu-\ntion if, pursuant to the forfeiture statute, “it seizes the\nrobbery proceeds and refuses to permit the defendant to\nuse them” to pay for his lawyer. Ibid.\n   And then, we confirmed in Monsanto what our “robbery\nsuspect” hypothetical indicated: Even prior to conviction\n(or trial)—when the presumption of innocence still applies—\nthe Government could constitutionally use §853(e) to\nfreeze assets of an indicted defendant “based on a find-\ning of probable cause to believe that the property will\nultimately be proved forfeitable.” 491 U. S., at 615. In\nMonsanto, too, the defendant wanted to use the property\nat issue to pay a lawyer, and maintained that the Fifth\nand Sixth Amendments entitled him to do so. We dis-\nagreed.     We first noted that the Government may\nsometimes “restrain persons where there is a finding of\nprobable cause to believe that the accused has committed\na serious offense.” Id., at 615–616. Given that power, we\ncould find “no constitutional infirmity in §853(e)’s authori-\nzation of a similar restraint on [the defendant’s] property”\nin order to protect “the community’s interest” in recover-\ning “ill-gotten gains.” Id., at 616. Nor did the defendant’s\ninterest in retaining a lawyer with the disputed assets\nchange the equation. Relying on Caplin & Drysdale, we\nreasoned: “[I]f the Government may, post-trial, forbid the\nuse of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then surely no\nconstitutional violation occurs when, after probable cause\nis adequately established, the Government obtains an\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\norder barring a defendant from frustrating that end by\ndissipating his assets prior to trial.” Ibid. So again: With\nprobable cause, a freeze is valid.\n   The Kaleys little dispute that proposition; their argu-\nment is instead about who should have the last word as to\nprobable cause. A grand jury has already found probable\ncause to think that the Kaleys committed the offenses\ncharged; that is why an indictment issued. No one doubts\nthat those crimes are serious enough to trigger forfeiture.\nSimilarly, no one contests that the assets in question\nderive from, or were used in committing, the offenses. See\nsupra, at 5. The only question is whether the Kaleys are\nconstitutionally entitled to a judicial re-determination of\nthe conclusion the grand jury already reached: that proba-\nble cause supports this criminal prosecution (or alterna-\ntively put, that the prosecution is not “baseless,” as the\nKaleys believe, supra, at 5). And that question, we think,\nhas a ready answer, because a fundamental and historic\ncommitment of our criminal justice system is to entrust\nthose probable cause findings to grand juries.\n   This Court has often recognized the grand jury’s singu-\nlar role in finding the probable cause necessary to initiate\na prosecution for a serious crime. See, e.g., Costello v.\nUnited States, 350 U. S. 359, 362 (1956). “[A]n indictment\n‘fair upon its face,’ and returned by a ‘properly constituted\ngrand jury,’ ” we have explained, “conclusively determines\nthe existence of probable cause” to believe the defendant\nperpetrated the offense alleged. Gerstein v. Pugh, 420\nU. S. 103, 117, n. 19 (1975) (quoting Ex parte United\nStates, 287 U. S. 241, 250 (1932)). And “conclusively” has\nmeant, case in and case out, just that. We have found no\n“authority for looking into and revising the judgment of\nthe grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose of de-\ntermining whether or not the finding was founded upon\nsufficient proof.” Costello, 350 U. S., at 362–363 (quoting\nUnited States v. Reed, 27 F. Cas. 727, 738 (No. 16,134) (CC\n8                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nNDNY 1852) (Nelson, J.)). To the contrary, “the whole\nhistory of the grand jury institution” demonstrates that “a\nchallenge to the reliability or competence of the evidence”\nsupporting a grand jury’s finding of probable cause “will\nnot be heard.” United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 54\n(1992) (quoting Costello, 350 U. S., at 364, and Bank of\nNova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250, 261 (1988)).\nThe grand jury gets to say—without any review, oversight,\nor second-guessing—whether probable cause exists to\nthink that a person committed a crime.\n  And that inviolable grand jury finding, we have decided,\nmay do more than commence a criminal proceeding (with\nall the economic, reputational, and personal harm that\nentails); the determination may also serve the purpose of\nimmediately depriving the accused of her freedom. If the\nperson charged is not yet in custody, an indictment trig-\ngers “issuance of an arrest warrant without further in-\nquiry” into the case’s strength. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 117,\nn. 19; see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U. S. 118, 129 (1997).\nAlternatively, if the person was arrested without a war-\nrant, an indictment eliminates her Fourth Amendment\nright to a prompt judicial assessment of probable cause to\nsupport any detention. See Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 114,\n117, n. 19. In either situation, this Court—relying on the\ngrand jury’s “historical role of protecting individuals from\nunjust persecution”—has “let [that body’s] judgment sub-\nstitute for that of a neutral and detached magistrate.”\nIbid. The grand jury, all on its own, may effect a pre-trial\nrestraint on a person’s liberty by finding probable cause to\nsupport a criminal charge.6\n——————\n  6 The grand jury’s unreviewed finding similarly may play a significant\n\nrole in determining a defendant’s eligibility for release before trial\nunder the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. §3141 et seq. That\nstatute creates a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is ineligible\nfor bail if “there is probable cause to believe” she committed certain\nserious crimes. §§3142(e)(2)–(3), (f). The Courts of Appeal have uni-\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

If judicial review\nof the grand jury’s probable cause determination is not\nwarranted (as we have so often held) to put a defendant on\ntrial or place her in custody, then neither is it needed to\nfreeze her property. The grand jury that is good enough—\nreliable enough, protective enough—to inflict those other\ngrave consequences through its probable cause findings\nmust be adequate to impose this one too. Indeed,\nMonsanto already noted the absence of any reason to hold\nproperty seizures to different rules: As described earlier,\nthe Court partly based its adoption of the probable cause\nstandard on the incongruity of subjecting an asset freeze\nto any stricter requirements than apply to an arrest or\nensuing detention. See supra, at 6; 491 U. S., at 615 (“[I]t\n——————\nformly held that presumption to operate whenever an indictment\ncharges those offenses. Relying on our instruction that an indictment\nreturned by a proper grand jury “conclusively determines the existence\nof probable cause,” the courts have denied defendants’ calls for any\njudicial reconsideration of that issue. United States v. Contreras, 776\nF. 2d 51, 54 (CA2 1985) (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 117,\nn. 19 (1975)); see, e.g., United States v. Suppa, 799 F. 2d 115, 117–119\n(CA3 1986); United States v. Vargas, 804 F. 2d 157, 162–163 (CA1\n1986) (per curiam); United States v. Hurtado, 779 F. 2d 1467, 1477–\n1479 (CA11 1985).\n   The dissent, while conceding this point, notes that courts may con-\nsider the “weight of the evidence” in deciding whether a defendant has\nrebutted the presumption. See post, at 9–10, and n. 3 (opinion of\nROBERTS, C. J.). And so they may, along with a host of other factors\nrelating to the defendant’s dangerousness or risk of flight. See\n§3142(g). But that is because the Bail Reform Act so allows—not\nbecause (as argued here) the Constitution compels the inquiry. And\neven that provision of the statute cuts against the dissent’s position,\nbecause it enables courts to consider only an evidentiary issue different\nfrom the probable cause determination. When it comes to whether\nprobable cause supports a charge—i.e., the issue here—courts making\nbail determinations are stuck, as all agree, with the grand jury’s\nfinding.\n10                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nwould be odd to conclude that the Government may not\nrestrain property” on the showing often sufficient to “re-\nstrain persons”). By similar token, the probable cause\nstandard, once selected, should work no differently for the\nsingle purpose of freezing assets than for all others.7 So\nthe longstanding, unvarying rule of criminal procedure we\nhave just described applies here as well: The grand jury’s\ndetermination is conclusive.\n   And indeed, the alternative rule the Kaleys seek would\nhave strange and destructive consequences. The Kaleys\nhere demand a do-over, except with a different referee.\nThey wish a judge to decide anew the exact question the\ngrand jury has already answered—whether there is prob-\nable cause to think the Kaleys committed the crimes\ncharged. But suppose the judge performed that task and\ncame to the opposite conclusion. Two inconsistent findings\nwould then govern different aspects of one criminal pro-\nceeding: Probable cause would exist to bring the Kaleys to\ntrial (and, if otherwise appropriate, hold them in prison),\nbut not to restrain their property. And assuming the\nprosecutor continued to press the charges,8 the same judge\nwho found probable cause lacking would preside over a\n——————\n  7Contrary to the dissent’s characterization, see post, at 11–12, noth-\n\ning in our reasoning depends on viewing one consequence of a probable\ncause determination (say, detention) as “greater” than another (say, the\nasset freeze here). (We suspect that would vary from case to case, with\nsome defendants seeing the loss of liberty as the more significant\ndeprivation and others the loss of a chosen lawyer.) We simply see no\nreason to treat a grand jury’s probable cause determination as conclu-\nsive for all other purposes (including, in some circumstances, locking up\nthe defendant), but not for the one at issue here.\n  8A prosecutor, of course, might drop the case because of the court’s\n\nruling, especially if he thought that decision would bring into play an\nethical standard barring any charge “that the prosecutor knows is not\nsupported by probable cause.” ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct\n3.8(a) (2013). But then the court would have effectively done what we\nhave long held it cannot: overrule the grand jury on whether to bring a\ndefendant to trial. See supra, at 7–8.\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntrial premised on its presence. That legal dissonance, if\nsustainable at all, could not but undermine the criminal\njustice system’s integrity—and especially the grand jury’s\nintegral, constitutionally prescribed role. For in this new\nworld, every prosecution involving a pre-trial asset freeze\nwould potentially pit the judge against the grand jury as\nto the case’s foundational issue.9\n   The Kaleys counter (as does the dissent, post, at 7) that\napparently inconsistent findings are not really so, because\nthe prosecutor could have presented scantier evidence to\nthe judge than he previously offered the grand jury. Sup-\npose, for example, that at the judicial hearing the prosecu-\ntor put on only “one witness instead of all five”; then, the\nKaleys maintain, the judge’s decision of no probable cause\nwould mean only that “the Government did not satisfy its\nburden[ ] on that one day in time.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 12, 18;\nsee Reply Brief 11–12. But we do not think that hypothet-\nical solves the problem. As an initial matter, it does not\nforeclose a different fact pattern: A judge could hear the\nexact same evidence as the grand jury, yet respond to it\ndifferently, thus rendering what even the Kaleys must\nconcede is a contradictory finding. And when the Kaleys’\nhypothetical is true, just what does it show? Consider that\nthe prosecutor in their example has left home some of the\nwitnesses he took to the grand jury—presumably because,\nas we later discuss, he does not yet wish to reveal their\nidentities or likely testimony. See infra, at 14–15. The\n——————\n  9 The dissent argues that the same is true when a judge hears evi-\n\ndence on whether frozen assets are traceable to a crime, because that\nallegation also appears in the indictment. See post, at 6–7; supra, at 3,\nand n. 3. But the tracing of assets is a technical matter far removed\nfrom the grand jury’s core competence and traditional function—to\ndetermine whether there is probable cause to think the defendant\ncommitted a crime. And a judge’s finding that assets are not traceable\nto the crime charged in no way casts doubt on the prosecution itself. So\nthat determination does not similarly undermine the grand jury or\ncreate internal contradictions within the criminal justice system.\n12                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\njudge’s ruling of no probable cause therefore would not\nmean that the grand jury was wrong: As the Kaleys con-\ncede, the grand jury could have heard more than enough\nevidence to find probable cause that they committed the\ncrimes charged. The Kaleys would win at the later hear-\ning despite, not because of, the case’s true merits. And we\nwould then see still less reason for a judge to topple the\ngrand jury’s (better supported) finding of probable cause.10\n  Our reasoning so far is straightforward. We held in\nMonsanto that the probable cause standard governs the\npre-trial seizure of forfeitable assets, even when they are\nneeded to hire a lawyer. And we have repeatedly affirmed\na corollary of that standard: A defendant has no right to\njudicial review of a grand jury's determination of probable\ncause to think a defendant committed a crime. In combi-\nnation, those settled propositions signal defeat for the\nKaleys because, in contesting the seizure of their property,\nthey seek only to relitigate such a grand jury finding.\n                            III\n   The Kaleys would have us undertake a different analy-\nsis, which they contend would lead to a different conclu-\nsion. They urge us to apply the balancing test of Mathews\nv. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976), to assess whether they\nhave received a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to\nchallenge the seizure of their assets. See Brief for Peti-\ntioners 32–64. Under that three-pronged test (reordered\n——————\n  10 The dissent claims as well that the hearing the Kaleys seek “would\n\nnot be mere relitigation” of the grand jury’s decision because they could\nnow “tell their side of the story.” Post, at 8. But the same could be said\nof an adversarial hearing on an indictment’s validity, which everyone\nagrees is impermissible because it “look[s] into and revise[s]” the grand\njury’s judgment. See ibid. (quoting Costello v. United States, 350 U. S.\n359, 362 (1956)). The lesson of our precedents, as described above, is\nthat a grand jury’s finding is “conclusive”—and thus precludes subse-\nquent proceedings on the same matter—even though not arising from\nadversarial testing. See supra, at 7–8; see also infra, at 17–18.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nhere for expositional purposes), a court must weigh (1) the\nburdens that a requested procedure would impose on the\nGovernment against (2) the private interest at stake, as\nviewed alongside (3) “the risk of an erroneous deprivation”\nof that interest without the procedure and “the probable\nvalue, if any, of [the] additional . . . procedural safe-\nguard[ ].” Mathews, 424 U. S., at 335. Stressing the\nimportance of their interest in retaining chosen counsel,\nthe Kaleys argue that the Mathews balance tilts hard\nin their favor. It thus overrides—or so the Kaleys claim—\nall we have previously held about the finality of grand\njury findings, entitling them to an evidentiary hearing be-\nfore a judge to contest the probable cause underlying the\nindictment.\n   The Government battles with the Kaleys over whether\nMathews has any application to this case. This Court\ndevised the test, the Government notes, in an administra-\ntive setting—to decide whether a Social Security recipient\nwas entitled to a hearing before her benefits were termi-\nnated. And although the Court has since employed the\napproach in other contexts, the Government reads Medina\nv. California, 505 U. S. 437 (1992), as foreclosing its use\nhere. In that case, we held that “the Mathews balancing\ntest does not provide the appropriate framework for as-\nsessing the validity of state procedural rules which . . . are\npart of the criminal process,” reasoning that because the\n“Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of\ncriminal procedure,” the Due Process Clause “has limited\noperation” in the field. Id., at 443. That settles that,\nasserts the Government. See Brief for United States 18.\nBut the Kaleys argue that Medina addressed a State’s\nprocedural rule and relied on federalism principles not\nimplicated here. Further, they claim that Medina con-\ncerned a criminal proceeding proper, not a collateral ac-\ntion seizing property. See Reply Brief 1–5. As to that sort\nof action, the Kaleys contend, Mathews should govern.\n14               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We decline to address those arguments, or to define the\nrespective reach of Mathews and Medina, because we need\nnot do so. Even if Mathews applied here—even if, that is,\nits balancing inquiry were capable of trumping this\nCourt’s repeated admonitions that the grand jury’s word is\nconclusive—the Kaleys still would not be entitled to the\nhearing they seek. That is because the Mathews test tips\nagainst them, and so only reinforces what we have already\nsaid. As we will explain, the problem for the Kaleys comes\nfrom Mathews’ prescribed inquiry into the requested\nprocedure’s usefulness in correcting erroneous depriva-\ntions of their private interest. In light of Monsanto’s\nholding that a seizure of the Kaleys’ property is erroneous\nonly if unsupported by probable cause, the added proce-\ndure demanded here is not sufficiently likely to make any\ndifference.\n   To begin the Mathews analysis, the Government has a\nsubstantial interest in freezing potentially forfeitable\nassets without an evidentiary hearing about the probable\ncause underlying criminal charges. At the least, such an\nadversarial proceeding—think of it as a pre-trial mini-trial\n(or maybe a pre-trial not-so-mini-trial)—could consume\nsignificant prosecutorial time and resources. The hearing\npresumably would rehearse the case’s merits, including\nthe Government’s theory and supporting evidence. And\nthe Government also might have to litigate a range of\nancillary questions relating to the conduct of the hearing\nitself (for example, could the Kaleys subpoena witnesses or\nexclude certain evidence?).\n   Still more seriously, requiring a proceeding of that kind\ncould undermine the Government’s ability either to obtain\na conviction or to preserve forfeitable property. To ensure\na favorable result at the hearing, the Government could\nchoose to disclose all its witnesses and other evidence.\nBut that would give the defendant knowledge of the Gov-\nernment’s case and strategy well before the rules of crimi-\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

S. 545, 559–561 (1977)\n(“There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a\ncriminal case”). And sometimes (particularly in organized\ncrime and drug trafficking prosecutions, in which forfeit-\nure questions often arise), that sneak preview might not\njust aid the defendant’s preparations but also facilitate\nwitness tampering or jeopardize witness safety. Alterna-\ntively, to ensure the success of its prosecution, the Gov-\nernment could hold back some of its evidence at the hear-\ning or give up on the pre-trial seizure entirely. But if the\nGovernment took that tack, it would diminish the likeli-\nhood of ultimately recovering stolen assets to which the\npublic is entitled.11 So any defense counsel worth his\nsalt—whatever the merits of his case—would put the\nprosecutor to a choice: “Protect your forfeiture by provid-\ning discovery” or “protect your conviction by surrendering\nthe assets.”12 It is small wonder that the Government\n——————\n  11 The  dissent says not to worry—the Government can obtain the\nassets after conviction by using 21 U. S. C. §853(c)’s “relation-back”\nprovision. See post, at 15. That provision is intended to aid the Gov-\nernment in recovering funds transferred to a third party—here, the\nKaleys’ lawyer—subsequent to the crime. But forfeiture applies only to\nspecific assets, so in the likely event that the third party has spent the\nmoney, the Government must resort to a State’s equitable remedies—\nwhich may or may not even be available—to force him to disgorge an\nequivalent amount. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 48–49. And indeed, if the\nGovernment could easily recover such monies, then few lawyers would\nagree to represent defendants like the Kaleys, and the dissent’s pro-\nposed holding would be for naught.\n  12 Compare Cassella, Criminal Forfeiture Procedure, 32 Am.

S.\n45, 53 (1932) (“It is hardly necessary to say that, the right\nto counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded\na fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice”).13\nIndeed, we have held that the wrongful deprivation of\nchoice of counsel is “structural error,” immune from review\nfor harmlessness, because it “pervades the entire trial.”\nGonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 150. Different lawyers do all\nkinds of things differently, sometimes “affect[ing] whether\nand on what terms the defendant . . . plea bargains, or\ndecides instead to go to trial”—and if the latter, possibly\naffecting whether she gets convicted or what sentence she\nreceives. Ibid. So for defendants like the Kaleys, having\n\n——————\n“[e]ven if defense counsel cannot prevail on the facts or the law, he may\nbe able to prevail anyway” because “[s]ometimes the government will\ndecide to give up its restraint on a piece of property rather than engage\nin litigation that will result in early discovery”).\n   13 Still, a restraint on assets could not deprive the Kaleys of represen-\n\ntation sufficient to ensure fair proceedings. The Sixth Amendment\nwould require the appointment of effective counsel if the Kaleys were\nunable to hire a lawyer. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). The vast majority\nof criminal defendants proceed with appointed counsel. And the Court\nhas never thought, as the dissent suggests today, that doing so risks\nthe “fundamental fairness of the actual trial.” Post, at 12; see post, at\n17–18. If it does, the right way to start correcting the problem is not by\nadopting the dissent’s position, but by ensuring that the right to effec-\ntive counsel is fully vindicated.\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nthe ability to retain the “counsel [they] believe[ ] to be\nbest”—and who might in fact be superior to any existing\nalternatives—matters profoundly. Id., at 146.\n   And yet Monsanto held, crucially for the last part of our\nMathews analysis, that an asset freeze depriving a defend-\nant of that interest is erroneous only when unsupported\nby a finding of probable cause. Recall that Monsanto\nconsidered a case just like this one, where the defendant\nwanted to use his property to pay his preferred lawyer.\nHe urged the Court to hold that the Government could\nseize assets needed for that purpose only after conviction.\nBut we instead decided that the Government could act\n“after probable cause [that the assets are forfeitable] is\nadequately established.” 491 U. S., at 616. And that\nmeans in a case like this one—where the assets’ connec-\ntion to the allegedly illegal conduct is not in dispute, see\nsupra, at 5—that a pre-trial seizure is wrongful only when\nthere is no probable cause to believe the defendants com-\nmitted the crimes charged. Or to put the same point\ndifferently, such a freeze is erroneous—notwithstanding\nthe weighty burden it imposes on the defendants’ ability to\nhire a chosen lawyer—only when the grand jury should\nnever have issued the indictment.\n   The Mathews test’s remaining prong—critical when the\ngovernmental and private interests both have weight—\nthus boils down to the “probable value, if any,” of a judicial\nhearing in uncovering mistaken grand jury findings of\nprobable cause. 424 U. S., at 335. The Kaleys (and the\ndissent) contend that such proceedings will serve an im-\nportant remedial function because grand juries hear only a\n“one-sided presentation[ ]” of evidence. Brief for Petition-\ners 57; see post, at 16. And that argument rests on a\ngenerally sound premise: that the adversarial process\nleads to better, more accurate decision-making. But in\nthis context—when the legal standard is merely probable\ncause and the grand jury has already made that finding—\n18                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nboth our precedents and other courts’ experience indicate\nthat a full-dress hearing will provide little benefit.\n   This Court has repeatedly declined to require the use of\nadversarial procedures to make probable cause determina-\ntions. Probable cause, we have often told litigants, is not a\nhigh bar: It requires only the “kind of ‘fair probability’ on\nwhich ‘reasonable and prudent [people,] not legal techni-\ncians, act.’ ” Florida v. Harris, 568 U. S. __, __ (2013) (slip\nop., at 5) (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231, 238\n(1983)); see Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 121 (contrasting proba-\nble cause to reasonable-doubt and preponderance stand-\nards). That is why a grand jury’s finding of probable cause\nto think that a person committed a crime “can be [made]\nreliably without an adversary hearing,” id., at 120; it is\nand “has always been thought sufficient to hear only the\nprosecutor’s side,” United States v. Williams, 504 U. S. 36,\n51 (1992). So, for example, we have held the “confronta-\ntion and cross-examination” of witnesses unnecessary in a\ngrand jury proceeding. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 121–122.\nSimilarly, we have declined to require the presentation of\nexculpatory evidence, see Williams, 504 U. S., at 51, and\nwe have allowed the introduction of hearsay alone, see\nCostello, 350 U. S., at 362–364. On each occasion, we\nrelied on the same reasoning, stemming from our recogni-\ntion that probable cause served only a gateway function:\nGiven the relatively undemanding “nature of the determi-\nnation,” the value of requiring any additional “formalities\nand safeguards” would “[i]n most cases . . . be too slight.”\nGerstein, 420 U. S., at 121–122.\n   We can come out no differently here. The probable\ncause determinations the Kaleys contest are simply those\nunderlying the charges in the indictment. No doubt the\nKaleys could seek to poke holes in the evidence the Gov-\nernment offered the grand jury to support those allega-\ntions. No doubt, too, the Kaleys could present evidence of\ntheir own, which might cast the Government’s in a differ-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nent light. (Presumably, the Kaleys would try in those two\nways to show that they did not steal, but instead lawfully\nobtained the medical devices they later resold. See supra,\nat 4.) Our criminal justice system of course relies on such\ncontestation at trial when the question becomes whether a\ndefendant is guilty beyond peradventure. But as we have\nheld before, an adversarial process is far less useful to the\nthreshold finding of probable cause, which determines\nonly whether adequate grounds exist to proceed to trial\nand reach that question. The probable cause decision, by\nits nature, is hard to undermine, and still harder to re-\nverse. So the likelihood that a judge holding an eviden-\ntiary hearing will repudiate the grand jury’s decision\nstrikes us, once more, as “too slight” to support a constitu-\ntional requirement. Gerstein, 420 U. S., at 122.\n   The evidence from other courts corroborates that view,\nover and over and over again. In the past two decades, the\ncourts in several Circuits have routinely held the kind of\nhearing the Kaleys seek. See supra, at 3, and n. 4. Yet\nneither the Kaleys nor their amici (mostly lawyers’ associ-\nations) have found a single case in which a judge found an\nabsence of probable cause to believe that an indicted de-\nfendant committed the crime charged. One amicus cites\n25 reported cases involving pre-trial hearings on asset\nfreezes. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Law-\nyers 4, n. 2. In 24 of those, the defendant lost outright.\nThe last involved a not-yet-indicted defendant (so no\ngrand jury finding); there, the District Court’s ruling for\nhim was reversed on appeal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15, 36.\nTo be sure, a kind of selection bias might affect those\nstatistics: Perhaps a prosecutor with a very weak case\nwould choose to abandon an asset freeze rather than face a\ndifficult hearing. See id., at 16, 37. But the Kaleys and\ntheir amici have also failed to offer any anecdotes of that\nkind; and we suspect that the far more common reason a\nprosecutor relinquishes a freeze is just to avoid premature\n20                   KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndiscovery. See supra, at 14–15. So experience, as far as\nanyone has discerned it, cuts against the Kaleys: It con-\nfirms that even under Mathews, they have no right to\nrevisit the grand jury’s finding.14\n                             IV\n   When we decided Monsanto, we effectively resolved this\ncase too. If the question in a pre-trial forfeiture case is\nwhether there is probable cause to think the defendant\ncommitted the crime alleged, then the answer is: whatever\nthe grand jury decides. And even if we test that proposi-\ntion by applying Mathews, we arrive at the same place: In\nconsidering such findings of probable cause, we have never\nthought the value of enhanced evidentiary procedures\nworth their costs. Congress of course may strike its own\nbalance and give defendants like the Kaleys the kind of\nhearing they want. Indeed, Congress could disapprove of\nMonsanto itself and hold pre-trial seizures of property to a\nhigher standard than probable cause. But the Due Pro-\n——————\n  14 As against all this—all we have formerly held and all other courts\n\nhave actually found—the dissent cites nothing: not a single decision of\nours suggesting, nor a single decision of a lower court demonstrating,\nthat formal, adversarial procedures are at all likely to correct any\ngrand jury errors. The dissent argues only that a hearing will have\n“probable value” for the Kaleys because “the deprivation of [their]\nright” to chosen counsel, once accomplished, is “effectively permanent.”\nPost, at 16. But that argument confuses two different parts of the\nMathews inquiry. The dissent’s point well underscores the importance\nof the Kaleys’ interest: As we have readily acknowledged, if the grand\njury made a mistake, the Kaleys have suffered a serious injury, which\ncannot later be corrected. See supra, at 16–17. (We note, though, that\nthe dissent, in asserting that injury’s uniqueness, understates the\nlosses that always attend a mistaken indictment, which no ultimate\nverdict can erase.) But the dissent’s argument about what is at stake\nfor the Kaleys says nothing about the crucial, last prong of Mathews,\nwhich asks whether and to what extent the adversarial procedures they\nrequest will in fact correct any grand jury errors. That part of the\nanalysis is what requires our decision, and the dissent’s view that the\nGovernment overreached in this particular case cannot overcome it.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

The grand jury gets the final word.\n  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Eleventh Cir-\ncuit and remand the case for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n                                           It is so ordered.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

He might\nreadily give all he owns to defend himself.\n  We have held, however, that the Government may\neffectively remove a defendant’s primary weapon of\ndefense—the attorney he selects and trusts—by freezing\nassets he needs to pay his lawyer. That ruling is not at\nissue. But today the Court goes further, holding that a\ndefendant may be hobbled in this way without an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the Government’s decision to freeze\nthose needed assets. I cannot subscribe to that holding\nand respectfully dissent.\n                              I\n  The facts of this case are important. They highlight the\nsignificance to a defendant of being able to hire his counsel\nof choice, and the potential for unfairness inherent in\ngiving the prosecutor the discretion to take that right\naway. Kerri Kaley worked as a sales representative for a\nJohnson & Johnson subsidiary, selling prescription medi-\ncal devices. Kaley and other sales representatives occa-\nsionally obtained outmoded or surplus devices from staff\n2                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nmembers at the medical facilities they served, when, for\nexample, those devices were no longer needed because\nthey had been superseded by newer models. Kaley sold\nthe unwanted devices to a Florida company, dividing the\nproceeds among the sales representatives.\n   Kaley learned in January 2005 that a federal grand jury\nwas investigating those activities as a conspiracy to sell\nstolen prescription medical devices. Kaley and her hus-\nband (who allegedly helped ship the products to Florida)\nretained counsel, who immediately set to work preparing\ntheir defense against any impending charges. Counsel\nregularly discussed the investigation with the Kaleys,\nhelped review documents demanded by the grand jury,\nand met with prosecutors in an attempt to ward off an\nindictment. Nonetheless preparing for the worst, the\nKaleys applied for a $500,000 equity line of credit on their\nhome to pay estimated legal fees associated with a trial.\nThey used that money to purchase a $500,000 certificate of\ndeposit, which they set aside until it would be needed to\npay their attorneys for the trial.\n   In February 2007, the grand jury returned a seven-\ncount indictment charging the Kaleys and another sales\nrepresentative, Jennifer Gruenstrass, with violations of\nfederal law. The indictment alleged that a “money judg-\nment” of over $2 million and the $500,000 certificate of\ndeposit were subject to forfeiture under 18 U. S. C.\n§981(a)(1)(C) because those assets constituted “proceeds”\nof the alleged crimes. Armed with this indictment, the\nprosecution obtained an ex parte order pursuant to 21\nU. S. C. §853(e), thereby freezing all of the Kaleys’ assets\nlisted in the indictment, including the certificate of deposit\nset aside for legal fees. The Government did not seek to\nfreeze any of Gruenstrass’s assets.\n   The Kaleys moved to vacate the order, requesting a\nhearing at which they could argue that there was no prob-\nable cause to believe their assets were forfeitable, because\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)             3\n\n                    ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ntheir alleged conduct was not criminal. They argued they\nwere entitled to such a hearing because the restraining\norder targeted funds they needed and had set aside to\nretain for trial the same counsel who had been preparing\ntheir defense for two years. And they contended that the\nprosecution was baseless because the Government could\nnot identify anyone who claimed ownership of the medical\ndevices alleged to have been “stolen.” During a telephone\nconference with a Magistrate Judge on the motion, the\nprosecution conceded that it had been able to trace only\n$140,000 in allegedly criminal proceeds to the Kaleys,\nwhich led the Magistrate Judge to question the lawfulness\nof restraining the listed assets.\n   Just two business days after that conference, the Gov-\nernment obtained a superseding indictment that added a\ncount of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18\nU. S. C. §1956(h). Adding that charge enabled the Gov-\nernment to proceed under a much broader forfeiture provi-\nsion than the one in the original indictment. While the\ncivil forfeiture provision in §981(a)(1)(C) authorized forfeit-\nure of property that “constitutes or is derived from pro-\nceeds traceable to” a qualifying criminal violation, the\ncriminal forfeiture provision now invoked by the Govern-\nment—§982(a)(1)—authorizes forfeiture of property “in-\nvolved in” a qualifying offense, or “any property traceable\nto such property.” The superseding indictment alleged\nthat a sum of more than $2 million, the certificate of de-\nposit reserved to pay legal expenses, and now the Kaleys’\nhome were subject to forfeiture. And again, the Govern-\nment sought an order freezing substantially all those\nassets.\n   The Kaleys objected, repeating the arguments they had\npreviously raised, and also contending that the prosecu-\ntors were being vindictive in adding the money laundering\ncharge and seeking broader forfeiture. The District Court\nnonetheless entered the broader order requested by the\n4                 KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nGovernment, and the restraint on the Kaleys’ assets re-\nmains in place.\n  While the Kaleys’ appeal from that denial was pending,\nthe Government proceeded to trial separately against\ntheir codefendant Gruenstrass. As the Government had\nnot sought to freeze Gruenstrass’s assets, she was repre-\nsented by her chosen counsel. Her counsel argued that the\nGovernment was pitching a fraud without a victim, be-\ncause no Government witness took the stand to claim\nownership of the allegedly stolen devices. The jury acquit-\nted Gruenstrass on all charges in less than three hours—a\ngood omen for the Kaleys and their counsel as they pre-\npared for their own trial.\n                              II\n   The issues at stake here implicate fundamental consti-\ntutional principles. The Sixth Amendment provides that\n“[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the\nright . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his de-\nfence.” In many ways, this is the most precious right a\ndefendant has, because it is his attorney who will fight for\nthe other rights the defendant enjoys. United States v.\nCronic, 466 U. S. 648, 653–654 (1984). And more than 80\nyears ago, we found it “hardly necessary to say that, the\nright to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be\nafforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own\nchoice.” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 53 (1932).\n   Indeed, we recently called the “right to select counsel of\none’s choice . . . . the root meaning of the constitutional\nguarantee” of the Sixth Amendment. United States v.\nGonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S. 140, 147–148 (2006). The\nAmendment requires “that a particular guarantee of fair-\nness be provided—to wit, that the accused be defended\nby the counsel he believes to be best.” Id., at 146. An\nindividual’s right to counsel of choice is violated “whenever\nthe defendant’s choice is wrongfully denied,” and such\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

A violation of\nthis right is therefore a “structural error,” ibid.; that\nis, one of the very few kinds of errors that “undermine\nthe fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole.” United\nStates v. Davila, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12).\n   It is of course true that the right to counsel of choice is\n(like most rights) not absolute. A defendant has no right\nto choose counsel he cannot afford, counsel who is not\na member of the bar, or counsel with an impermissible\nconflict of interest. Wheat v. United States, 486 U. S. 153,\n159 (1988). And a district court need not always shuffle\nits calendar to accommodate a defendant’s preferred coun-\nsel if it has legitimate reasons not to do so. Morris v.\nSlappy, 461 U. S. 1, 11–12 (1983). But none of those\nlimitations is imposed at the unreviewable discretion of a\nprosecutor—the party who wants the defendant to lose at\ntrial.\n   This Court has held that the prosecution may freeze\nassets a defendant needs to retain his counsel of choice\nupon “a finding of probable cause to believe that the assets\nare forfeitable.” United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600,\n615 (1989). The Kaleys do not challenge that holding\nhere. But the Court in Monsanto acknowledged and re-\nserved the crucial question whether a defendant had the\nright to be heard before the Government could take such\naction. Id., at 615, n. 10.1\n   There was good reason for that caution. The possibility\nthat a prosecutor could elect to hamstring his target by\npreventing him from paying his counsel of choice raises\nsubstantial concerns about the fairness of the entire pro-\nceeding. “A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic require-\n——————\n  1 Because the District Court in Monsanto had imposed the restraining\n\norder after an “extensive, 4-day hearing on the question of probable\ncause,” it was “pointless” for this Court to decide whether a hearing was\nrequired to “adequately establish[ ]” probable cause. 491 U.

Issues concerning the denial of counsel of choice\nimplicate the overall fairness of the trial because they\n“bear[ ] directly on the ‘framework within which the trial\nproceeds.’ ” Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 150 (quoting Arizona\nv. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)).\n                             III\n   Notwithstanding the substantial constitutional issues at\nstake, the majority believes that syllogistic-type reasoning\neffectively resolves this case. Ante, at 12. The majority’s\nreasoning goes like this: First, to freeze assets prior to\ntrial, the Government must show probable cause to believe\nthat a defendant has committed an offense giving rise to\nforfeiture. Second, grand jury determinations of probable\ncause are nonreviewable. Therefore, the Kaleys cannot\n“relitigate [the] grand jury finding” of probable cause to\navoid a pretrial restraint of assets they need to retain\ntheir counsel of choice. Ibid. I do not view the matter as\nnearly so “straightforward,” and neither did the multiple\nCourts of Appeals since Monsanto that have granted\ndefendants the type of hearing the Kaleys request. See\nante, at 3, n. 4.\n   To begin with, the majority’s conclusion is wrong on its\nown terms. To freeze assets prior to trial, the Government\nmust show probable cause to believe both that (1) a de-\nfendant has committed an offense giving rise to forfeiture\nand (2) the targeted assets have the requisite connection\nto the alleged criminal conduct. 21 U. S. C. §853(e)(1)(A).\nThe Solicitor General concedes—and all Courts of Appeals\nto have considered the issue have held—that “defendants\nare entitled to show that the assets that are restrained are\nnot actually the proceeds of the charged criminal offense,”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 45; that is, that the second prong of the\nrequired showing is not satisfied. But by listing prop-\nerty in the indictment and alleging that it is subject to\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                     7\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nforfeiture—as required to restrain assets before trial under\n§853(e)(1)(A)—the grand jury found probable cause to\nbelieve those assets were linked to the charged offenses,\njust as it found probable cause to believe the Kaleys com-\nmitted the underlying crimes. App. 60–61 (separate in-\ndictment section alleging criminal forfeiture, including of\nthe certificate of deposit); see United States v. Jones, 160\nF. 3d 641, 645 (CA10 1998); United States v. Monsanto,\n924 F. 2d 1186, 1197 (CA2 1991) (en banc); Dept. of Jus-\ntice, Asset Forfeiture Policy Manual 128 (2013) (“That the\nindictment alleges that property is subject to forfeiture\nindicates that the grand jury has made a probable cause\ndetermination.”). Neither the Government nor the major-\nity gives any reason why the District Court may reconsider\nthe grand jury’s probable cause finding as to traceability—\nand in fact constitutionally must, if asked—but may not do\nso as to the underlying charged offenses.2\n   In any event, the hearing the Kaleys seek would not be\nmere relitigation of the grand jury proceedings. At that\nhearing, the District Court would consider the merits of\nthe prosecution to determine whether there is probable\ncause to believe the Kaleys’ assets are forfeitable, not to\ndetermine whether the Kaleys may be tried at all. If the\njudge agrees with the Kaleys, he will merely hold that the\nGovernment has not met its burden at that hearing to\njustify freezing the assets the Kaleys need to pay their\nattorneys. The Government may proceed with the prose-\n\n——————\n   2 The majority’s only response is to characterize the grand jury’s\n\nfinding of traceability as merely a “technical matter.” Ante, at 11, n. 9.\nBut the indictment draws no distinction between the grand jury’s\nfinding of probable cause to believe that the Kaleys committed a crime\nand its finding of probable cause to believe that certain assets are\ntraceable to that crime. Both showings must be made to justify a\npretrial asset restraint under Monsanto, and there is nothing in that\ncase or the indictment that justifies treating one grand jury finding\ndifferently than the other.\n8                KALEY v.

J., dissenting\n\ncution, but the Kaleys will have their chosen counsel at\ntheir side.\n  Even though the probable cause standard applies at\nboth the indictment stage and the pretrial asset restraint\nhearing, the judge’s determination will be based on differ-\nent evidence than that previously presented to the grand\njury. For its part, the Government may choose to put on\nmore or less evidence at the hearing than it did before\nthe grand jury. And of course the Kaleys would have the\nopportunity to tell their side of the story—something the\ngrand jury never hears. See United States v. Williams,\n504 U. S. 36, 51–52 (1992). Here, much of what the\nKaleys want to present comes from Gruenstrass’s trial—\nevidence that the grand jury obviously could not have\nconsidered. So even if the judge determined that probable\ncause to justify the pretrial asset restraint had not been\nadequately established, that determination would not in\nany way amount to “looking into and revising the judg-\nment of the grand jury upon the evidence, for the purpose\nof determining whether or not the finding was founded\nupon sufficient proof.” Ante, at 7 (quoting Costello v.\nUnited States, 350 U. S. 359, 362–363 (1956) (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). The judge’s decision based\non the evidence presented at the hearing would have no\nnecessary legal or logical consequence for the underlying\nprosecution because it would be based on different evi-\ndence and used for a different purpose.\n  The majority warns that allowing a judge to consider\nthe underlying merits of the prosecution for purposes of\ndetermining whether a defendant’s assets may be re-\nstrained pretrial could create “legal dissonance” with the\ngrand jury’s indictment, which “could not but undermine\nthe criminal justice system’s integrity.” Ante, at 10–11.\nBut as explained, such a judicial finding based on different\nevidence with both sides present would not contradict the\ngrand jury’s probable cause finding based on what was\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   9\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nbefore it. That finding would still suffice to accomplish its\npurpose—to call for a trial on the merits of the charges.\nRather than creating “dissonance,” the traditional roles of\nthe principal actors in our justice system would remain\nrespected: The grand jury decides whether a defendant\nshould be required to stand trial, the judge decides pre-\ntrial matters and how the trial should proceed, and the\njury decides whether the defendant is guilty of the crime.\n   Indeed, in the bail context—the pretrial determination\nthat is perhaps the closest analogue to the pretrial re-\nstraint of assets at issue here—we allow judicial inquiries\ninto the underlying merits of the indicted charges, without\nconcern about intruding into the province of the grand\njury. An indictment charging sufficiently serious crimes\ngives rise to a rebuttable presumption that a defend-\nant is not eligible for pretrial release. See 18 U. S. C.\n§§3142(e)(3) and (f). Such a defendant is nonetheless\nentitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he may contest\n(among other things) “the weight of the evidence against”\nhim, §3142(g)(2). Yet no one would say that the district\ncourt encroached on the grand jury’s role if the court de-\ntermined that it would not authorize pretrial detention\nbecause of the weakness of the prosecution’s case. See,\ne.g., United States v. Hurtado, 779 F. 2d 1467, 1479–1480\n(CA11 1985) (recognizing that in considering the “weight\nof the evidence” to decide whether the presumption is\nrebutted, “it may well be necessary to open up the issue of\nprobable cause since that too is a question of evidentiary\nweight”). That makes sense, because the district court has\nconsidered the underlying merits of the charges based on\ndifferent information and for a different purpose than the\ngrand jury did. Such a defendant would be granted pre-\ntrial release, but would still have to show up for trial.3\n——————\n  3 The majority cites cases in which courts have correctly rejected re-\n\nquests for a judicial redetermination of the grand jury’s probable cause\n10                    KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n  In any event, few things could do more to “undermine\nthe criminal justice system’s integrity,” ante, at 11, than to\nallow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then,\nat its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent\nby depriving him of his counsel of choice—without even an\nopportunity to be heard. That is the result of the Court’s\ndecision in this case, and it is fundamentally at odds with\nour constitutional tradition and basic notions of fair play.\n                            IV\n  The majority is no more persuasive in applying the due\nprocess balancing test set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge,\n424 U. S. 319 (1976).4 As an initial matter, the majority\n——————\nfinding for purposes of determining whether the rebuttable presumption\nof pretrial detention is triggered. See ante, at 8–9, n. 6. But those\ncases do not question the judge’s authority to consider the underlying\nmerits of the Government’s case (including what the grand jury has\nalleged in the indictment) for purposes of determining whether that\npresumption has been rebutted. E.g., United States v. Dominguez, 783\nF. 2d 702, 706 (CA7 1986) (“evidence probative of guilt is admitted at\na detention hearing only to support or challenge the weight of the gov-\nernment’s case against the defendant”); see also United States v. Jones,\n583 F. Supp. 2d 513, 517 (SDNY 2008) (releasing a defendant pretrial\nafter determining that “the weight of the evidence now overcomes the\npresumption of detention”). The majority notes that this inquiry in the\nbail context is authorized by statute, but that does not alter the crucial\npoint: Where the prosecutor seeks to use the indictment to impose\nanother significant pretrial consequence on a defendant, judges are\nallowed to inquire into the underlying merits of the prosecution (includ-\ning the very same matters the grand jury has considered) as part of the\ninquiry into whether that consequence is justified, and that has not\nresulted in “dissonance” or the undermining of the grand jury’s role.\n   4 Under our due process precedents, it is clear that the Mathews test\n\napplies in this case, rather than the inquiry set forth in Medina v.\nCalifornia, 505 U. S. 437 (1992). We held in Medina that Mathews is\ninapplicable when “assessing the validity of state procedural rules” that\n“are part of the criminal process.” Id., at 443. We have therefore\napplied Medina rather than Mathews only when considering such due\nprocess challenges, including, for example, the allocation of burdens of\nproof or what type of evidence may be admitted. See, e.g., id., at 443–\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                  11\n\n                       ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\ngives short shrift to the Kaleys’ interests at stake. “The\npresumption of innocence, although not articulated in the\nConstitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our\nsystem of criminal justice.” Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S.\n501, 503 (1976). Whatever serious crimes the grand jury\nalleges the Kaleys committed, they are presumptively\ninnocent of those charges until final judgment. Their right\nto vindicate that presumption by choosing the advocate\nthey believe will best defend them is, as explained, at the\nvery core of the Sixth Amendment.\n  I suspect that, for the Kaleys, that right could hardly be\nmore precious than it is now. In addition to potentially\nlosing the property the Government has already frozen—\nincluding their home—the Kaleys face maximum prison\nterms of five years (18 U. S. C. §371), ten years (§2314),\nand 20 years (§1956(h)) for the charges in the superseding\nindictment. The indictment means they must stand trial\non those charges. But the Kaleys plainly have an urgent\ninterest in having their chosen counsel—who has worked\nwith them since the grand jury’s investigation began, two\nyears before the indictment—mount their best possible\ndefense at trial.\n  The majority alludes to our cases recognizing that in-\ndictments may result in the temporary deprivation of a\ndefendant’s liberty without judicial review, and suggests\nthat indictments therefore must also be “good enough” to\ndeprive a defendant of property without judicial review.\nAnte, at 9–10. Even if this greater-includes-the-lesser\n——————\n446 (burden of proving incompetence to stand trial); Patterson v. New\nYork, 432 U. S. 197, 202 (1977) (burden of proving affirmative defense);\nDowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342, 352 (1990) (admissibility of\ntestimony about a prior crime of which the defendant was acquitted).\nThis case is not about such questions, but about the collateral issue of\nthe pretrial deprivation of property a defendant needs to exercise his\nright to counsel of choice. Mathews therefore provides the relevant\ninquiry.\n12               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nreasoning might be valid in other contexts, it is not when\nthe property at issue is needed to hire chosen counsel. In\nthe context of a prosecution for serious crimes, it is far\nfrom clear which interest is greater—the interest in tem-\nporary liberty pending trial, or the interest in using one’s\navailable means to avoid imprisonment for many years\nafter trial. Retaining one’s counsel of choice ensures the\nfundamental fairness of the actual trial, and thus may be\nfar more valuable to a criminal defendant than pretrial\nrelease.\n   As for the Government’s side, the Court echoes the\nGovernment’s concerns that a hearing would place de-\nmands on its resources and interfere with its desire to\nkeep its trial strategy close to the vest. These concerns\nare somewhat curious in light of the majority’s emphasis\non how easy it is to make a probable cause showing. And\nthey are even more surprising in light of the extensive\ndiscovery obligations already imposed on the Government\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 and Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963). The emphasis the Gov-\nernment places on pretrial secrecy evokes an outdated\nconception of the criminal trial as “a poker game in which\nplayers enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their\ncards until played.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 82\n(1970).\n   Moreover, recall that the Government concedes that due\nprocess guarantees defendants a hearing to contest the\ntraceability of the restrained assets to the charged con-\nduct. If a defendant requests such a hearing, the Gov-\nernment will likely be required to reveal something about\nits case to demonstrate that the assets have the requisite\nconnection to the charged offenses.\n   In any event, these concerns are exaggerated. What the\nGovernment would be required to show in a pretrial re-\nstraint hearing is similar to pretrial showings prosecutors\nmake in other contexts on a daily basis. As mentioned\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           13\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nabove, when the Government seeks an order detaining a\ndefendant pending trial, it routinely makes an extensive\nevidentiary showing—voluntarily disclosing much of its\nevidence and trial strategy—in support of that relief. See\nBrief for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice as\nAmicus Curiae 11–18. The Government makes similar\nshowings in the context of other pretrial motions, such\nas motions to admit hearsay evidence under the co-\nconspirator exception, or to discover attorney-client com-\nmunications made in furtherance of a future crime. Id., at\n19–28.\n  In those contexts, as in this one, the decision how much\nto “show its hand” rests fully within the Government’s\ndiscretion. If it has a strong case and believes that pretrial\nrestraint is necessary to preserve the assets for forfeit-\nure, the Government may choose to make a strong evi-\ndentiary showing and have little concern about doing so.\nIn a closer case, where the Government is more concerned\nabout tipping its hand, it may elect to forgo a pretrial\nrestraint of those assets the defendant needs to pay his\ncounsel. I see no great burden on the Government in\nallowing it to strike this balance as it sees fit when consid-\nering a pretrial asset restraint that would deprive a de-\nfendant of his right to counsel of choice. In the end, it is a\nbit much to argue that the Government has discretion to\ndeprive a defendant—without a hearing—of the counsel he\nhas chosen to present his defense, simply to avoid the\nmere possibility of a premature peek at some aspect of\nwhat the Government intends to do at trial.\n  The majority also significantly underestimates the\namount of control judges can exercise in these types of\nhearings. The Circuits that allow such hearings have\nafforded judges a great deal of flexibility in structuring\nthem. Judges need not apply the Federal Rules of Evi-\ndence during the hearings, and they can take many steps,\nincluding in camera proceedings, to ensure that witness\n14               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nsafety and grand jury secrecy are fully preserved. See\nMonsanto, 924 F. 2d, at 1198; United States v. E-Gold,\nLtd., 521 F. 3d 411, 418–419 (CADC 2008).\n   Moreover, experience in the Second Circuit, where\ndefendants have for more than 20 years been afforded the\ntype of hearing the Kaleys seek, indicates that such hear-\nings do not occur so often as to raise substantial concerns\nabout taxing the resources of the Government and lower\ncourts. See Brief for New York Council of Defense Law-\nyers as Amicus Curiae 4–9. As the majority notes, only 25\nreported cases appear to have addressed such hearings.\nId., at 4. This relative rarity is unsurprising. To even be\nentitled to the hearing, defendants must first show a\ngenuine need to use the assets to retain counsel of choice.\nSee United States v. Bonventre, 720 F. 3d 126, 131 (CA2\n2013). And defendants too have an incentive not to tip\ntheir hands as to trial strategy—perhaps to an even greater\nextent than the Government, given that defendants bear\ncomparatively few discovery obligations at a criminal\ntrial. In light of the low bar of the probable cause stand-\nard, many defendants likely conclude that the possible\nbenefits of the hearing are not worth the candle.\n   For those hearings that do occur, they are by all appear-\nances ably controlled by district judges to keep them man-\nageable and to limit the potential for excess or abuse. See\nBrief for New York Council of Defense Lawyers as Amicus\nCuriae 6–8. In addition, where such hearings are allowed,\nprosecutors and defense counsel often reach agreements\nconcerning the scope and conditions of any protective\norder that accommodate the interests of both sides. See\nid., at 8–9. When the right at stake is as fundamental as\nhiring one’s counsel of choice—the “root meaning” of the\nSixth Amendment, Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U. S., at 147–\n148—the Government’s interest in saving the time and\nexpense of a limited number of such proceedings is not\nparticularly compelling.\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    15\n\n                        ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The Government does have legitimate interests that are\nserved by forfeiture of allegedly tainted assets. Caplin &\nDrysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617, 629\n(1989). And imposing a pretrial restraint on such assets\ndoes increase the likelihood that they will be available if\nthe defendant is convicted.5 But that interest is protected\nin other ways that mitigate the concern that defendants\nwill successfully divert forfeitable assets from the Gov-\nernment’s reach if afforded a hearing. The relation-back\nprovision in 21 U. S. C. §853(c) provides that title to for-\nfeitable assets, once adjudged forfeitable, vests in the\nGovernment as of the time the offense was committed.\nSection 853(c) then provides that the Government may\nseek a “special verdict of forfeiture” as to any forfeited\nproperty that was subsequently transferred to a third\nparty. The Government protests that recovery of such\nassets will often be complicated and subject to the vagar-\nies of state law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49–50. But such com-\nplaints of administrative inconvenience carry little weight\nin this particular context, when the Government knows\nexactly where the money has gone: to an attorney who is,\nafter all, an officer of the court, and on notice that the\nGovernment claims title to the assets.\n   And we are not talking about all of a defendant’s assets\nthat are subject to forfeiture—only those that the defend-\nant can show are necessary to secure his counsel of choice.\n——————\n  5 The Government and the majority place particular emphasis on the\nuse of forfeited assets to provide restitution to victims of crime. See\nBrief for United States 41–42, and n. 14; ante, at 2, n. 1. It is worth\nnoting in this respect that in prosecuting the other sales representa-\ntives that participated with the Kaleys in the allegedly fraudulent\nconduct, the Government’s position as to who exactly is the “victim” has\nshifted frequently. See Brief for Petitioners 9–11 (hospitals); id., at 18,\n21–23 (their employers); Tr. of Oral Arg. 43–44 (hospitals). As one\nprosecutor forthrightly acknowledged at the sentencing hearing of an\nalleged co-conspirator, “we can’t make restitution.” Brief for Petition-\ners 11.\n16               KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nHere, for example, the Kaleys have identified as needed to\npay counsel only a discrete portion of the assets the Gov-\nernment seeks. The statistics cited by the Court on the\ntotal amount of assets recovered by the Government and\nprovided as restitution for victims, ante, at 2, n. 1, are\ncompletely beside the point.\n   The majority ultimately concludes that a pretrial hear-\ning of the sort the Kaleys seek would be a waste of time.\nAnte, at 17–20. No. It takes little imagination to see that\nseizures based entirely on ex parte proceedings create a\nheightened risk of error. Common sense tells us that\nsecret decisions based on only one side of the story will\nprove inaccurate more often than those made after hear-\ning from both sides. We have thus consistently recognized\nthat the “fundamental instrument for judicial judgment” is\n“an adversary proceeding in which both parties may par-\nticipate.” Carroll v. President and Comm’rs of Princess\nAnne, 393 U. S. 175, 183 (1968). In the present context,\nsome defendants (like the Kaleys) may be able to show\nthat the theory of prosecution is legally defective through\nan argument that almost certainly was not presented to\nthe grand jury. And as discussed above, supra, at 13–15,\nprosecutors in some cases elect not to freeze needed assets,\nor they negotiate tailored protective orders to serve the\ninterests of both sides—something they would be unlikely\nto do if the hearings were rote exercises.\n   Given the risk of an erroneous restraint of assets needed\nto retain chosen counsel, the “probable value” of the “addi-\ntional safeguard” a pretrial hearing would provide is\nsignificant. That is because the right to counsel of choice\nis inherently transient, and the deprivation of that right\neffectively permanent. In our cases suggesting that little\nwould be gained by requiring an adversary hearing on\nprobable cause or imposing stricter evidentiary require-\nments in grand jury proceedings, we have noted that the\ngrand jury is not where the ultimate question of “the guilt\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           17\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\nor innocence of the accused is adjudicated.” United States\nv. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343 (1974); see United States\nv. Williams, 504 U. S. 36, 51 (1992) (explaining that the\ngrand jury hears only from the prosecutor because “ ‘the\nfinding of an indictment is only in the nature of an en-\nquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be tried and\ndetermined’ ” (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 300\n(1769)). If the grand jury considers incomplete or incom-\npetent evidence in deciding to return an indictment, the\ndefendant still has the full trial on the merits, with all its\n“formalities and safeguards,” Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S.\n103, 122 (1975), to prove his innocence.\n   Here, by contrast, the Government seeks to use the\ngrand jury’s probable cause determination to strip the\nKaleys of their counsel of choice. The Kaleys can take no\ncomfort that they will be able to vindicate that right in a\nfuture adversarial proceeding. Once trial begins with\nsomeone other than chosen counsel, the right is lost, and it\ncannot be restored based on what happens at trial. “The\nfundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity\nto be heard ‘at a meaningful time and in a meaningful\nmanner.’ ” Mathews, 424 U. S., at 333 (quoting Armstrong\nv. Manzo, 380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965)). If the Kaleys are to\nhave any opportunity to meaningfully challenge that\ndeprivation, they must have it before the trial begins.\n                       *   *     *\n   The issues presented here implicate some of the most\nfundamental precepts underlying the American criminal\njustice system. A person accused by the United States of\ncommitting a crime is presumed innocent until proven\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But he faces a foe of\npowerful might and vast resources, intent on seeing him\nbehind bars. That individual has the right to choose the\nadvocate he believes will most ably defend his liberty at\ntrial.\n18                KALEY v. UNITED STATES\n\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\n\n   The trial is governed by rules designed to ensure that,\nwhatever the ultimate verdict, we can be confident to the\nextent possible that justice was done, within the bounds of\nthe Constitution. That confidence is grounded in our\nbelief in the adversary system. “The very premise of our\nadversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advo-\ncacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate\nobjective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go\nfree.” Herring v. New York, 422 U. S. 853, 862 (1975).\nToday’s decision erodes that confidence by permitting\nthe Government to deprive a criminal defendant of his right\nto counsel of choice, without so much as a chance to be\nheard on why such a significant pretrial deprivation is\nunwarranted.\n   The majority wraps up its analysis by blandly noting\nthat Congress is of course free to extend broader protec-\ntion to criminal defendants. Ante, at 20. Not very likely.\nIn this area it is to the courts that those charged with\ncrime must turn.\n   Federal prosecutors, when they rise in court, represent\nthe people of the United States. But so do defense lawyers—\none at a time. In my view, the Court’s opinion pays\ninsufficient respect to the importance of an independent\nbar as a check on prosecutorial abuse and government\noverreaching. Granting the Government the power to take\naway a defendant’s chosen advocate strikes at the heart of\nthat significant role. I would not do it, and so respectfully\ndissent.\n", "precedential_status": "Published", "resource_uri": "/api/rest/v2/document/2654756/", "sha1": "c3bba314ccd108d525e379f7cecf660718b50840", "source": "C", "supreme_court_db_id": "2013-019", "time_retrieved": "2014-02-26T17:02:07.836228"}
