Argued November 12, 2013\u2014Decided March 4, 2014\nTo safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the\n  financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Con-\n  gress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of the Act\u2019s provi-\n  sions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provi-\n  sion instructed: \u201cNo [public] company . . ., or any . . . contractor [or]\n  subcontractor . . . of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend,\n  threaten, harass, or . . . discriminate against an employee in the\n  terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activ-\n  ity].\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A(a).\n     Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respond-\n  ents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or\n  manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual\n  funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both\n  plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating\n  to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by\n  FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the\n  suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under\n  \u00a71514A, for that provision protects only employees of public compa-\n  nies, and not employees of private companies that contract with pub-\n  lic companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court\u2019s de-\n  nial of FMR\u2019s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed,\n  concluding that the term \u201can employee\u201d in \u00a71514A(a) refers only to\n  employees of public companies.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that\n  \u00a71514A\u2019s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public\n2                          LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    company\u2019s private contractors and subcontractors. Pp. 9\u201329.\n       (a) This reading of \u00a71514A is supported by the provision\u2019s text.\n    Pp. 9\u201316.\n         (1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provi-\n    sion\u2019s language. See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108. As\n    relevant here, \u00a71514A(a) provides that \u201cno . . . contractor . . . may dis-\n    charge . . . an employee.\u201d The ordinary meaning of \u201can employee\u201d in\n    this proscription is the contractor\u2019s own employee. FMR\u2019s \u201cnarrower\n    construction\u201d requires inserting \u201cof a public company\u201d after \u201can em-\n    ployee,\u201d but where Congress meant \u201can employee of a public compa-\n    ny,\u201d it said so.\n       The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited re-\n    taliatory measures enumerated in \u00a71514A(a)\u2014discharge, demotion,\n    suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment\n    terms and conditions\u2014are actions an employer takes against its own\n    employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse\n    actions against employees of the public company with whom they\n    contract. FMR\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71514A, therefore, would shrink to\n    insignificance the provision\u2019s ban on retaliation by contractors. The\n    protected activity covered by \u00a71514A, and the provision\u2019s enforcement\n    procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an\n    employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whis-\n    tleblowing employee. Pp. 9\u201314.\n         (2) FMR\u2019s textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that \u201can\n    employee\u201d must be read to refer exclusively to public company em-\n    ployees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the per-\n    sonal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their house-\n    keepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than\n    real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments\n    opposing FMR\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A. FMR also urges that its reading\n    is supported by the provision\u2019s statutory headings, but those head-\n    ings are \u201cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the\n    text.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528.\n    Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (b) Other considerations support the Court\u2019s textual analysis.\n    Pp. 16\u201327.\n         (1) The Court\u2019s reading fits \u00a71514A\u2019s aim to ward off another En-\n    ron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress\u2019 understanding\n    that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting\n    fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that\n    fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the\n    employees of Enron\u2019s contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numer-\n    ous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, audi-\n    tors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only \u00a71514A\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    3\n\n                                Syllabus\n\n  affords such employees protection from retaliation by their employers\n  for complying with the Act\u2019s reporting requirements. Pp. 16\u201320.\n        (2) This Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A avoids insulating the entire\n  mutual fund industry from \u00a71514A. Virtually all mutual funds are\n  structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are\n  managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly,\n  the \u201cnarrower construction\u201d endorsed by FMR would leave \u00a71514A\n  with no application to mutual funds. The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A,\n  in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are\n  often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mu-\n  tual funds. Pp. 20\u201322.\n        (3) There is scant evidence that today\u2019s decision will open any\n  floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside \u00a71514A\u2019s purposes. The\n  Department of Labor\u2019s regulations have interpreted \u00a71514A as pro-\n  tecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable\n  to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor\n  has asserted a \u00a71514A claim based on allegations unrelated to share-\n  holder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various\n  limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court\n  need not determine \u00a71514A\u2019s bounds here, however, because, if plain-\n  tiffs\u2019 allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the \u201cfirsthand\n  witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud\u201d Congress anticipated \u00a71514A\n  would protect. S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, p. 10. Pp. 22\u201324.\n        (4) The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Pro-\n  tection Act does not affect this Court\u2019s task of determining whether\n  Congress in 2002 afforded protection to whistleblowing contractor\n  employees. Pp. 24\u201327.\n     (c) AIR 21\u2019s whistleblower protection provision has been read to\n  cover, in addition to employees of air carriers, employees of contrac-\n  tors and subcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statutory\n  texts and whistleblower protective aims, the Court reads the words\n  \u201can employee\u201d in AIR 21 and in \u00a71514A to have similar import.\n  Pp. 27\u201329.\n     JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE THOMAS, relying only on 18\n  U. S. C. \u00a71514A\u2019s text and broader context, agreed that \u00a71514A pro-\n  tects employees of private contractors from retaliation when they re-\n  port covered forms of fraud.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v. FMR LLC ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n                                [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To safeguard investors in public companies and restore\ntrust in the financial markets following the collapse of\nEnron Corporation, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. See S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146,\npp. 2\u201311 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the\ntime here relevant, instructed:\n    \u201cNo [public] company . . . , or any officer, employee,\n    contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company,\n    may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,\n    or in any other manner discriminate against an em-\n    ployee in the terms and conditions of employment be-\n    cause of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].\u201d\n    \u00a71514A(a) (2006 ed.).\nThis case concerns the definition of the protected class:\nDoes \u00a71514A shield only those employed by the public\ncompany itself, or does it shield as well employees of pri-\nvately held contractors and subcontractors\u2014for example,\ninvestment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises\u2014\nwho perform work for the public company?\n2                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We hold, based on the text of \u00a71514A, the mischief to\nwhich Congress was responding, and earlier legislation\nCongress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees\nof private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shel-\nters employees of the public company served by the con-\ntractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our\nprincipal reasons, then describe this controversy and\nexplain our decision more comprehensively.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees\nof private companies that contract to advise or manage\nmutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public\ncompanies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle\nis to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund inves-\ntors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another\ncompany\u2019s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual\nfund\u2019s investment adviser or manager.\n   Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both\nplaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to\nthe mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse\naction by their employers. Plaintiffs read \u00a71514A to con-\nvey that \u201c[n]o . . . contractor . . . may . . . discriminate\nagainst [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].\u201d We find\nthat reading consistent with the text of the statute and\nwith common sense. Contractors are in control of their\nown employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control\nsomeone else\u2019s workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to\nCongress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating\nagainst whistleblowers employed by the public company\nthe contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to\nretaliate against its own employees when they reveal\ncorporate fraud.\n   In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, contractors and subcontractors, including the ac-\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron\u2019s\nfraud and its coverup. When employees of those contrac-\ntors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encoun-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the\nconduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work\nwith public companies. See, e.g., 116 Stat. 750\u2013765, 773\u2013\n774, 784, \u00a7\u00a7101\u2013107, 203\u2013206, 307. Given Congress\u2019\nconcern about contractor conduct of the kind that contrib-\nuted to Enron\u2019s collapse, we regard with suspicion con-\nstruction of \u00a71514A to protect whistleblowers only when\nthey are employed by a public company, and not when\nthey work for the public company\u2019s contractor.\n   Congress borrowed \u00a71514A\u2019s prohibition against retalia-\ntion from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Avia-\ntion Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR\n21), 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121. That Act provides: \u201cNo air carrier\nor contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may dis-\ncharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an\nemployee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment\u201d when the employee provides\ninformation regarding violations \u201crelating to air carrier\nsafety\u201d to his or her employer or federal authorities.\n\u00a742121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to\nemployees of air carriers, employees of contractors and\nsubcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statu-\ntory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read\nthe words \u201can employee\u201d in AIR 21 and in \u00a71514A to have\nsimilar import.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act)\naims to \u201cprevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud,\nprotect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of\nsuch fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their\nactions.\u201d S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, p. 2 (2002) (hereinafter\n4                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep.).1 Of particular concern to Congress was abundant\nevidence that Enron had succeeded in perpetuating its\nmassive shareholder fraud in large part due to a \u201ccorpo-\nrate code of silence\u201d; that code, Congress found, \u201cdiscour-\nage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not\nonly to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the\nSEC, but even internally.\u201d Id., at 4\u20135 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When employees of Enron and its ac-\ncounting firm, Arthur Andersen, attempted to report\ncorporate misconduct, Congress learned, they faced retali-\nation, including discharge. As outside counsel advised\ncompany officials at the time, Enron\u2019s efforts to \u201cquiet\u201d\nwhistleblowers generally were not proscribed under then-\nexisting law. Id., at 5, 10. Congress identified the lack of\nwhistleblower protection as \u201ca significant deficiency\u201d in\nthe law, for in complex securities fraud investigations,\nemployees \u201care [often] the only firsthand witnesses to the\nfraud.\u201d Id., at 10.\n  Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley addresses this concern.\nTitled \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud,\u201d \u00a7806 added a new\nprovision to Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71514A, which reads in relevant part:\n     \u201cCivil action to protect against retaliation in\n     fraud cases\n     \u201c(a) WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Title VIII of the Act, which contains the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision at issue in this case, was authored by Senators Leahy and\nGrassley and originally constituted a discrete bill, S. 2010. We thus\nlook to the Senate Report for S. 2010, S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, as the\nSenate Report relevant here. See 148 Cong. Rec. S7418 (daily ed. July\n26, 2002) (statement of Sen.

Instead, they contract with investment\nadvisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day oper-\nations, which include making investment decisions, pre-\nparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawson was\nemployed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidi-\nary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.\nZang was employed by a different FMR LLC subsidiary,\nFidelity Management & Research Co., and later by one of\nthat company\u2019s subsidiaries, FMR Co., Inc. For conven-\nience, we refer to respondents collectively as FMR.\n   Lawson worked for FMR for 14 years, eventually serv-\ning as a Senior Director of Finance. She alleges that, after\nshe raised concerns about certain cost accounting method-\nologies, believing that they overstated expenses associated\nwith operating the mutual funds, she suffered a series\nof adverse actions, ultimately amounting to constructive\ndischarge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years,\nmost recently as a portfolio manager for several of the\nfunds. He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for\nraising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC reg-\nistration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.\nLawson and Zang separately filed administrative com-\nplaints alleging retaliation proscribed by \u00a71514A. After\nexpiration of the 180-day period specified in \u00a71514A(b)(1),\nLawson and Zang each filed suit in the U. S. District\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.\n   FMR moved to dismiss the suits, arguing, as relevant,\nthat neither plaintiff has a claim for relief under \u00a71514A.\nFMR is privately held, and maintained that \u00a71514A pro-\ntects only employees of public companies\u2014i.e., companies\nthat either have \u201ca class of securities registered under\nsection 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\u201d or that\nare \u201crequired to file reports under section 15(d)\u201d of that\n8                       LAWSON v.

Supp. 2d 141\n(Mass. 2010).\n   On interlocutory appeal, a divided panel of the First\nCircuit reversed. 670 F. 3d 61 (2012). The Court of Ap-\npeals majority acknowledged that FMR is a \u201ccontractor\u201d4\nwithin the meaning of \u00a71514A(a), and thus among the\nactors prohibited from retaliating against \u201can employee\u201d\nwho engages in protected activity. The majority agreed\nwith FMR, however, that \u201can employee\u201d refers only to\nemployees of public companies and does not cover a con-\ntractor\u2019s own employees. Id., at 68\u201380. Judge Thompson\ndissented. In her view, the majority had \u201cimpose[d] an\nunwarranted restriction on the intentionally broad lan-\nguage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d and \u201cbar[red] a signifi-\ncant class of potential securities-fraud whistleblowers\nfrom any legal protection.\u201d Id., at 83.\n   Several months later, the ARB issued a decision in an\nunrelated case, Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc., LLC,\nNo. 10\u2013111 etc., ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029 (May 31, 2012),5\ndisagreeing with the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of\n\u00a71514A. In a comprehensive opinion, the ARB explained\nits position that \u00a71514A affords whistleblower protection\nto employees of privately held contractors that render\nservices to public companies.

United States, 498 U. S.\n103, 108 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). As Judge Thompson observed in her dissent\nfrom the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment, \u201cboiling [\u00a71514A(a)]\ndown to its relevant syntactic elements, it provides that\n\u2018no . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.\u2019 \u201d\n670 F. 3d, at 84 (quoting \u00a71514A(a)). The ordinary mean-\ning of \u201can employee\u201d in this proscription is the contractor\u2019s\nown employee.\n  FMR\u2019s interpretation of the text requires insertion of\n\u201cof a public company\u201d after \u201can employee.\u201d But where Con-\ngress meant \u201can employee of a public company,\u201d it said so:\nWith respect to the actors governed by \u00a71514A, the provi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Department of Labor.\u201d Post, at 18. Because we agree with the\nARB\u2019s conclusion that \u00a71514A affords protection to a contractor\u2019s\nemployees, we need not decide what weight that conclusion should\ncarry. We note, however, that the SEC apparently does not share the\ndissent\u2019s view that it, rather than DOL, has interpretive authority over\n\u00a71514A. To the contrary, the SEC is a signatory to the Government\u2019s\nbrief in this case, which takes the position that Congress has charged\nthe Secretary of Labor with interpreting \u00a71514A. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9\u201311, 31\u201334. That view is hardly surprising\ngiven the lead role played by DOL in administering whistleblower\nstatutes. See supra, at 5. The dissent observes that the SEC \u201chas\nnot issued a regulation applying \u00a71514A whistleblower protection to\nemployees of public company contractors,\u201d post, at 18, but omits to\ninform that the SEC has not promulgated any regulations interpreting\n\u00a71514A, consistent with its view that Congress delegated that respon-\nsibility to DOL.\n10                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsion\u2019s interdictions run to the officers, employees, contrac-\ntors, subcontractors, and agents \u201cof such company,\u201d i.e., a\npublic company. \u00a71514A(a). Another anti-retaliation pro-\nvision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: \u201c[A] broker or dealer\nand persons employed by a broker or dealer who are\ninvolved with investment banking activities may not,\ndirectly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to\nretaliate against any securities analyst employed by that\nbroker or dealer or its affiliates . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778o\u2013\n6(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added). In contrast, nothing in\n\u00a71514A\u2019s language confines the class of employees protected\nto those of a designated employer. Absent any textual\nqualification, we presume the operative language means\nwhat it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate\nagainst its own employee for engaging in protected whistle-\nblowing activity.7\n   Section 1514A\u2019s application to contractor employees\nis confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term\n\u201can employee\u201d to the provision as a whole. The prohib-\nited retaliatory measures enumerated in \u00a71514A(a)\u2014\ndischarge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or dis-\ncrimination in the terms and conditions of employment\u2014\nare commonly actions an employer takes against its\nown employees. Contractors are not ordinarily posi-\ntioned to take adverse actions against employees of the\npublic company with whom they contract. FMR\u2019s inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A, therefore, would shrink to insignifi-\ncance the provision\u2019s ban on retaliation by contractors.\nThe dissent embraces FMR\u2019s \u201cnarrower\u201d construction. See\npost, at 2, 3, 4, 7.\n   FMR urges that Congress included contractors in\n\u00a71514A\u2019s list of governed actors simply to prevent public\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We need not decide in this case whether \u00a71514A also prohibits a\n\ncontractor from retaliating against an employee of one of the other\nactors governed by the provision.\n                      Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                    11\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ncompanies from avoiding liability by employing contrac-\ntors to effectuate retaliatory discharges. FMR describes\nsuch a contractor as an \u201cax-wielding specialist,\u201d illustrated\nby George Clooney\u2019s character in the movie Up in the Air.8\nBrief for Respondents 24\u201325 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding special-\nist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad\nnews that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in\ndeciding who to terminate. If the company employing the\nax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retal-\niatory reasons, the \u00a71514A claim would properly be di-\nrected at the company. Hiring the ax-wielder would not\ninsulate the company from liability. Moreover, we see no\nindication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the\nreal-world problem that prompted Congress to add con-\ntractors to \u00a71514A.9\n   Moving further through \u00a71514A to the protected activity\ndescribed in subsection (a)(1), we find further reason to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 This hypothetical originates in a Seventh Circuit opinion, Fleszar v.\nUnited States Dept. of Labor, 598 F. 3d 912, 915 (2010), and is men-\ntioned in a footnote in the First Circuit\u2019s opinion in this case, 670 F. 3d\n61, 69, n. 11 (2012).\n   9 When asked during oral argument for an example of actual circum-\n\nstances in which a contractor would have employment decisionmak-\ning authority over public company employees, FMR\u2019s counsel cited\nKalkunte v. DVI Financial Servs., Inc., No. 05\u2013139 etc., ALJ No. 2004\u2013\nSOX\u2013056 (Feb. 27, 2009). Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. That case involved a\nbankrupt public company that hired a private company to handle its\ndissolution. The ARB found the private company liable under \u00a71514A\nbecause it acted as a \u201ccontractor, subcontractor, or agent\u201d of the public\ncompany in discharging the claimant. ALJ No. 2004\u2013SOX\u2013056, at 10\n(emphasis added). Neither FMR nor its amici have pointed us to any\nactual situation in which a public company employee would be vulner-\nable to retaliatory conduct by a contractor not already covered as an\n\u201cagent\u201d under \u00a71514A. Notably, even in Tides v. The Boeing Co., 644\nF. 3d 809 (CA9 2011), the case cited by the dissent for the proposition\nthat contractors may possess \u201cmanagerial authority\u201d over public\ncompany employees, post, at 10, the alleged retaliation was by the\npublic company itself.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieve that Congress presumed an employer-employee\nrelationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower.\nEmployees gain protection for furnishing information to a\nfederal agency, Congress, or \u201ca person with supervisory\nauthority over the employee (or such other person working\nfor the employer who has the authority to investigate,\ndiscover, or terminate misconduct).\u201d \u00a71514A(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). And under \u00a71514A(a)(2), employees are\nprotected from retaliation for assisting \u201cin a proceeding\nfiled or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the em-\nployer) relating to an alleged violation\u201d of any of the enu-\nmerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other\nfederal law relating to shareholder fraud. \u00a71514A(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The reference to employer knowledge is\nan additional indicator of Congress\u2019 expectation that the\nretaliator typically will be the employee\u2019s employer, not\nanother entity less likely to know of whistleblower com-\nplaints filed or about to be filed.\n   Section 1514A\u2019s enforcement procedures and remedies\nsimilarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an em-\nployee of the retaliator. As earlier noted, see supra, at 6,\n\u00a71514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under \u00a71514A \u201cshall\nbe governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\nsection 42121(b) of title 49,\u201d i.e., AIR 21\u2019s anti-retaliation\nprovision. Throughout \u00a742121(b), the respondent is re-\nferred to as \u201cthe employer.\u201d See 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121(b)(2)\n(B)(ii) (The Secretary shall not conduct an investigation\ninto a retaliation claim \u201cif the employer demonstrates,\nby clear and convincing evidence, that the employer would\nhave taken the same unfavorable personnel action in\nthe absence of that behavior.\u201d); \u00a742121(b)(2)(B)(iv)\n(\u201cRelief may not be ordered . . . if the employer demon-\nstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the employer\nwould have taken the same unfavorable personnel action\nin the absence of that behavior.\u201d).\n   Regarding remedies, \u00a71514A(c)(2) states that a success-\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

The most\nsensible reading of \u00a71514A\u2019s numerous references to an\nemployer-employee relationship between the respondent\nand the claimant is that the provision\u2019s protections run\nbetween contractors and their own employees.\n   Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a\nstrange design. Under the dissent\u2019s \u201cnarrower\u201d construc-\ntion, post, at 2, 3, 4, 7, a public company\u2019s contractor may\nnot retaliate against a public company\u2019s employees, aca-\ndemic here because the public company has no employees.\nAccording to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to\nprevent \u201ca gaping hole\u201d that would allow public companies\nto \u201cevade \u00a71514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage\nin the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee\ncould not.\u201d Post, at 10. This cannot be right\u2014even if\nCongress had omitted any reference to contractors, sub-\ncontractors, or agents in \u00a71514A, the remaining language\nsurely would prohibit a public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the\npublic company\u2019s employees; hiring an ax-wielder to an-\nnounce an employee\u2019s demotion does not change the fact\nthat the public company is the entity commanding the\ndemotion. Under the dissent\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A, the\ninclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more\nthan make the contractor secondarily liable for complying\nwith such marching orders\u2014hardly a hole at all.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The dissent suggests that we \u201cfai[l] to recognize\u201d that its construc-\n\ntion also makes contractors primarily liable for retaliating of their own\n14                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the\ndissent\u2019s view of \u00a71514A\u2019s reach to prevail: Contractors\u2019\nemployees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerable\nto retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistle\non a scheme to defraud the public company\u2019s investors,\neven a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor. Not\nonly would mutual fund advisers and managers escape\n\u00a71514A\u2019s control. Legions of accountants and lawyers\nwould be denied \u00a71514A\u2019s protections. See infra, at 19\u201322.\nInstead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing\nbabysitters and the like, post, at 1\u20132, 6, 12\u201313, 20, the\ndissent might pause to consider whether a Congress,\nprompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whis-\ntleblower protection countless professionals equipped to\nbring fraud on investors to a halt.\n                             B\n  We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR.\nFirst, FMR urges that \u201can employee\u201d must be read to refer\nexclusively to public company employees to avoid the\nabsurd result of extending protection to the personal\nemployees of company officers and employees, e.g., their\nhousekeepers or gardeners. See Brief for Respondents 19\u2013\n20; post, at 1\u20132, 6, 12\u201313, 20. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral do not defend \u00a71514A\u2019s application to personal\nemployees. They argue, instead, that the prohibition\nagainst an \u201cofficer\u201d or \u201cemployee\u201d retaliating against \u201can\nemployee\u201d may be read as imposing personal liability only\non officers and employees who retaliate against other\npublic company employees.

As \n\nexplained supra, at 11\u201312, n. 9, however, FMR and its supporters have\n\nidentified not even one real-world instance of a public company employee\n\nasserting a \u00a71514A claim alleging retaliatory conduct by a contractor.\n\nAgain, no \u201cgaping hole,\u201d practically no hole at all.\n\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 16.11 FMR calls this\nreading \u201cbizarre,\u201d for it would ascribe to the words \u201can\nemployee\u201d in \u00a71514A(a) \u201cone meaning if the respondent is\nan \u2018officer\u2019 and a different meaning if the respondent is a\n\u2018contractor.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 20\u201321.\n   We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral offer an interpretation at odds with the text Con-\ngress enacted. If, as we hold, \u201can employee\u201d includes\nemployees of contractors, then grammatically, the term\nalso includes employees of public company officers and\nemployees. Nothing suggests Congress\u2019 attention was\ndrawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue,\nhowever, is likely more theoretical than real. Few house-\nkeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon\nand comprehend evidence of their employer\u2019s complicity in\nfraud. In any event, FMR\u2019s point is outweighed by the\ncompelling arguments opposing FMR\u2019s contention that \u201can\nemployee\u201d refers simply and only to public company em-\nployees. See supra, at 9\u201314. See also infra, at 23\u201324\n(limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad\napplications).\n     Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings\nsupport the exclusion of contractor employees from\n\u00a71514A\u2019s protections. Although \u00a71514A\u2019s own heading is\nbroad (\u201cCivil action to protect against retaliation in fraud\ncases\u201d), subsection (a) is captioned \u201cWhistleblower Protec-\ntion for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.\u201d Simi-\nlarly, the relevant public law section, \u00a7806 of Sarbanes-\nOxley, is captioned \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly\nTraded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\u201d 116\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The ARB endorsed this view in Spinner v.

We\nhave no occasion to determine whether the ARB would be entitled to\ndeference in this regard, for, as explained in text, we find that the\nstatutory text unambiguously affords protection to personal employees\nof public company officers and employees. \u00a71514A(a).\n16                      LAWSON v.

S. 519\n(1947), we explained that where, as here, \u201cthe [statutory]\ntext is complicated and prolific, headings and titles can do\nno more than indicate the provisions in a most general\nmanner.\u201d Id., at 528. The under-inclusiveness of the two\nheadings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent.\nThe provision indisputably extends protection to employ-\nees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant\nto \u00a715(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are\nnot \u201cpublicly traded.\u201d And the activity protected under\n\u00a71514A is not limited to \u201cprovid[ing] evidence of fraud\u201d; it\nalso includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regula-\ntions. \u00a71514A(a)(1). As in Trainmen, the headings here\nare \u201cbut a short-hand reference to the general subject\nmatter\u201d of the provision, \u201cnot meant to take the place of\nthe detailed provisions of the text.\u201d 331 U. S., at 528.\nSection 1514A is attended by numerous indicators that the\nstatute\u2019s prohibitions govern the relationship between a\ncontractor and its own employees; we do not read the\nheadings to \u201cundo or limit\u201d those signals.

It is common ground that Congress installed whis-\ntleblower protection in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as one\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 AIR 21\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, on which \u00a71514A is based, in-\n\ncludes a similarly composed heading, \u201cDiscrimination against airline\nemployees.\u201d 49 U.

And, as the ARB observed in Spinner, \u201cCongress\nplainly recognized that outside professionals\u2014ac-\ncountants, law firms, contractors, agents, and the like\u2014\nwere complicit in, if not integral to, the shareholder fraud\nand subsequent cover-up [Enron] officers . . . perpetrated.\u201d\nALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, pp. 12\u201313. Indeed, the Senate\nReport demonstrates that Congress was as focused on the\nrole of Enron\u2019s outside contractors in facilitating the fraud\nas it was on the actions of Enron\u2019s own officers. See, e.g.,\nS.

In\nparticular, FMR points to sections of the Act requiring\naccountants and lawyers for public companies to investi-\ngate and report misconduct, or risk being banned from\nfurther practice before the SEC. Id., at 41 (citing 15\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77215(c)(4), 7245). These requirements, however,\nindicate why Congress would have wanted to extend\n\u00a71514A\u2019s coverage to the many lawyers and accountants\nwho perform outside work for public companies. Although\nlawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regula-\ntions and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provi-\nsion of the Act other than \u00a71514A affords them protection\nfrom retaliation by their employers for complying with the\nAct\u2019s reporting requirements.14 In short, we cannot coun-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 FMR urges that the Senate Report\u2019s references to \u201cemployees of\n\npublicly traded companies\u201d demonstrate that Congress wanted to limit\nwhistleblower protection to such employees. Brief for Respondents 30\u2013\n31. This argument fails for the same reason that FMR\u2019s reliance on the\nstatutory section headings fails: \u201cemployees of publicly traded compa-\nnies\u201d must be understood as shorthand not designed to capture every\nemployee covered by \u00a71514A. See supra, at 15\u201316. Senator Sarbanes\u2019\nstatement, cited in the concurring opinion, post, at 2, is similarly\nimprecise. The Act indisputably covers private accounting firms and\nlaw firms that provide services to public companies. See, e.g., 15 U. S.\nC. \u00a7\u00a77215, 7245. Indeed, Senator Sarbanes acknowledged this point in\nhis very next sentence. See 148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of\nSen. Sarbanes) (\u201cThis legislation prohibits accounting firms from\nproviding certain specified consulting services if they are also the\nauditors of the company.\u201d).\n  14 The dissent suggests that the Public Company Accounting Oversight\n20                      LAWSON v.

As companies\n\u201crequired to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securi-\nties Exchange Act of 1934,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A(a), mutual\nfunds unquestionably are governed by \u00a71514A. Because\nmutual funds figure prominently among such report-filing\ncompanies, Congress presumably had them in mind when\nit added to \u201cpublicly traded companies\u201d the discrete cate-\ngory of companies \u201crequired to file reports under section\n15(d).\u201d\n   Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they\nhave no employees of their own; they are managed, in-\nstead, by independent investment advisers. See S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amend-\nments to the Investment Company Act of 1940). The\nUnited States investment advising industry manages\n$14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors. See\n2013 Investment Company Fact Book 7 (53d ed.), availa-\nble at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf (as\nvisited Feb. 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). These investment advisers, under our reading\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nBoard\u2019s and the SEC\u2019s authority to sanction unprofessional conduct by \n\naccountants and lawyers, respectively, \u201ccould well provide\u201d a disincen-\ntive to retaliate against other accountants and lawyers. See post, at 15.\n\nThe possibility of such sanctions, however, is cold comfort to the ac-\ncountant or lawyer who loses her job in retaliation for her efforts to \n\ncomply with the Act\u2019s requirements if, as the dissent would have it,\n\n\u00a71514A does not enable her to seek reinstatement or backpay. \n\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Under FMR\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s\nreading, in contrast, \u00a71514A has no application to mutual\nfunds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed\nby the privately held investment management companies,\nnot by the mutual funds themselves.

See also post, at 16\u201317, n. 10. But\nthis separate regulation does not remove the problem, for\nnowhere else in these legislative measures are investment\nmanagement employees afforded whistleblower protection.\nSection 1514A alone shields them from retaliation for\nbringing fraud to light.\n  Indeed, affording whistleblower protection to mutual\nfund investment advisers is crucial to Sarbanes-Oxley\u2019s\nendeavor to \u201cprotect investors by improving the accuracy\nand reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to\nthe securities laws.\u201d 116 Stat. 745.

C.\n\u00a71348), but also mail, wire, and bank fraud (\u00a7\u00a71341, 1343,\n1344). Including contractor employees in the protected\nclass, they therefore assert, could \u201ccas[t] a wide net over\nemployees who have no exposure to investor-related activ-\nities and thus could not possibly assist in detecting inves-\ntor fraud.\u201d Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America as Amicus Curiae 3. See also Brief for\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association as\nAmicus Curiae 7\u201316.\n   There is scant evidence, however, that these floodgate-\nopening concerns are more than hypothetical. DOL\u2019s\nregulations have interpreted \u00a71514A as protecting con-\ntractor employees for almost a decade.15 See 69 Fed. Reg.\n52105\u201352106 (2004). Yet no \u201cnarrower construction\u201d\nadvocate has identified even a single case in which the\nemployee of a private contractor has asserted a \u00a71514A\nclaim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud.\nFMR\u2019s parade of horribles rests solely on Lockheed Martin\nCorp. v.

More telling, at the time of the\nDodd-Frank amendments, DOL regulations provided that\n\u00a71514A protects contractor employees.         See 29 CFR\n\u00a71980.101 (2009). Congress included in its alterations no\nlanguage gainsaying that protection. As Judge Thomp-\nson\u2019s dissent from the First Circuit\u2019s judgment observes,\n\u201cCongress had a miles-wide opening to nip [DOL\u2019s] regula-\ntion in the bud if it had wished to do so. It did not.\u201d 670\nF. 3d, at 88.\n   Dodd-Frank also establishes a corporate whistleblowing\nreward program, accompanied by a new provision pro-\nhibiting any employer from retaliating against \u201ca whistle-\nblower\u201d for providing information to the SEC, participating\nin an SEC proceeding, or making disclosures required\nor protected under Sarbanes-Oxley and certain other\nsecurities laws. 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20136(a)(6), (b)(1), (h). FMR\nurges that, as this provision covers employees of all com-\npanies, public or private, \u201c[t]here is no justification\u201d for\nreading \u00a71514A to cover employees of contractors: \u201cAny\n\u2018gap\u2019 that might, arguendo, have existed for employees of\nprivate entities between 2002 and 2010 has now been\nclosed.\u201d Brief for Respondents 44.17\n   FMR, we note, somewhat overstates Dodd-Frank\u2019s cov-\nerage. Section 1514A\u2019s protections include employees\nwho provide information to any \u201cperson with supervisory\nauthority over the employee.\u201d \u00a71514A(a)(1)(C).

It is, instead, to de-\ntermine whether Congress afforded protection to contractor\nemployees when it enacted \u00a71514A in 2002. If anything\nrelevant to our inquiry can be gleaned from Dodd-Frank,\nit is that Congress apparently does not share FMR\u2019s\nconcerns about extending protection comprehensively\nto corporate whistleblowers.18\n                              IV\n   We end by returning to AIR 21\u2019s whistleblower protec-\ntion provision, 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121, enacted two years\nbefore Sarbanes-Oxley. Congress designed \u00a71514A to\n\u201ctrack . . . as closely as possible\u201d the protections afforded\nby \u00a742121. S. Rep., at 30. To this end, \u00a71514A incorpo-\nrates by cross-reference \u00a742121\u2019s administrative enforce-\nment regime, see 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A(b)(2), and contains\nparallel statutory text. Compare \u00a71514A(a) (\u201cNo [public]\ncompany . . . or any officer, employee, contractor, subcon-\ntractor, or agent of such company, may discharge, demote,\nsuspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner dis-\ncriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions\nof employment\u201d for engaging in protected activity) with 49\nU.

The ARB has con-\nsistently construed AIR 21 to cover contractor employees.\nE.g., Evans v. Miami Valley Hospital, ARB No. 07\u2013118\netc., ALJ No. 2006\u2013AIR\u2013022, pp. 9\u201311 (June 30, 2009);\nPeck v.

Reg.\n15454, 15457\u201315458 (2002). The Senate Report for AIR 21\nsupports this reading, explaining that the Act \u201cprovide[s]\nemployees of airlines, and employees of airline contractors\nand subcontractors, with statutory whistleblower protec-\ntion.\u201d S. Rep. No. 105\u2013278, p. 22 (1998).21\n   The Court of Appeals recognized that Congress modeled\n\u00a71514A on \u00a742121, and that \u00a742121 has been understood\nto protect contractor employees. 670 F. 3d, at 73\u201374. It\nnonetheless declined to interpret \u00a71514A the same way,\nbecause, in its view, \u201cimportant differences\u201d separate the\ntwo provisions. First, unlike \u00a71514A, \u00a742121 contains a\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  19 For other provisions borrowing from AIR 21, see 49 U. S. C. \u00a720109,\ngoverning rail carriers, which incorporates AIR 21\u2019s enforcement\nprocedures, and \u00a731105, governing motor carriers, which incorporates\nAIR 21\u2019s proof burdens.\n   20 The ARB has also interpreted similarly worded whistleblower pro-\n\ntection provisions in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, 49\nU. S. C. \u00a760129(a), and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, 42\nU. S. C. \u00a75851(a), as protecting employees of contractors. See Rocha v.\nAHR Utility Corp., ARB No. 07\u2013112, ALJ No. 2006\u2013PSI\u2013001 etc., p. 2\n(June 25, 2009); Robinson v.

These distinctions, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned, render \u00a71514A less amenable to an\ninclusive construction of the protected class. Ibid.22\n  We do not find these textual differences overwhelming.\nTrue, Congress strayed from \u00a742121\u2019s pattern in failing to\ndefine \u201ccontractor\u201d for purposes of \u00a71514A, and in adding\n\u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d to \u00a71514A\u2019s list of governed\nactors. And we agree that \u00a71514A covers a far wider\nrange than \u00a742121 does. But in our view, neither differ-\nence warrants the determination that \u00a71514A omits em-\nployees of contractors while \u00a742121 includes them. The\nprovisions\u2019 parallel text and purposes counsel in favor of\ninterpreting the two provisions consistently. And we have\nalready canvassed the many reasons why \u00a71514A is most\nsensibly read to protect employees of contractors. See\nsupra, at 9\u201322.\n                       *     *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A\nwhistleblower protection extends to employees of contrac-\ntors and subcontractors. The judgment of the U. S.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v. FMR LLC ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF \n\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n\n                        [March 4, 2014] \n\n\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins,\nconcurring in principal part and concurring in the\njudgment.\n   I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71514A protects employees of private contractors from\nretaliation when they report covered forms of fraud. As\nthe Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically\nflows from \u00a71514A\u2019s text and broader context. I therefore\njoin the Court\u2019s opinion in principal part.\n   I do not endorse, however, the Court\u2019s occasional excur-\nsions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and\ncontext, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance\non legislative history rests upon several frail premises.\nFirst, and most important: That the statute means what\nCongress intended. It does not. Because we are a govern-\nment of laws, not of men, and are governed by what\nCongress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole\nobject of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what\na law says. Second: That there was a congressional \u201cin-\ntent\u201d apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On\nmost issues of detail that come before this Court, I am\nconfident that the majority of Senators and Representa-\ntives had no views whatever on how the issues should be\nresolved\u2014indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.\nThird: That the views expressed in a committee report or a\n2                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\n\nfloor statement represent those of all the Members of that\nHouse. Many of them almost certainly did not read the\nreport or hear the statement, much less agree with it\u2014not\nto mention the Members of the other House and the Presi-\ndent who signed the bill.\n   Since congressional \u201cintent\u201d apart from enacted text is\nfiction to begin with, courts understandably allow them-\nselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today\u2019s\nopinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative\nrecord that are consistent with its holding that \u00a71514A\ncovers employees of private contractors and subcontrac-\ntors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in\nthe opposite direction. For example, the following remark\nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s lead sponsor in the Senate:\n\u201c[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively\nto public companies\u2014that is, to companies registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not\napplicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[*] who make up the\nvast majority of companies across the country.\u201d 148 Cong.\nRec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).\n   Two other minor points in the Court\u2019s opinion I do not\nagree with. First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate\nanti-retaliation provision, 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121(a), \u201chas been\nread\u201d by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor\nemployees. Ante, at 29. Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled\n\u201cProcedure,\u201d contains cross-references to the procedural\nrules set forth in \u00a742121(b), but the substantive provisions\nof \u00a71514A(a) are worded quite differently from the sub-\nstantive prohibition of \u00a742121, which is contained in sub-\nsection (a)\u2014thus making interpretation of the latter an\nunreliable guide to \u00a71514A\u2019s meaning. Second, I do not\nagree with the Court\u2019s acceptance of the possible validity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The Congressional Record reads \u201cprovide companies,\u201d but context as\nwell as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener\u2019s error for \u201cprivate\ncompanies.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

Despite\nthese clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe\n\u00a71514A to apply only to public company employees who\nblow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company\nemployers.

As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act au-\nthorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his\nemployer\u2014a parent who happens to work at the local\nWalmart (a public company)\u2014if the parent stops employ-\ning the babysitter after he expresses concern that the\nparent\u2019s teenage son may have participated in an Internet\npurchase fraud. And it opens the door to a cause of action\nagainst a small business that contracts to clean the local\nStarbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted\nafter reporting that another nonpublic company client has\nmailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.\n   Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweep-\ning regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and\nprivate businesses to litigation over fraud reports that\nhave no connection to, or impact on, the interests of pub-\nlic company shareholders. But because nothing in the text,\ncontext, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests\nthat Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with\nthe statutory text, it fails to recognize that \u00a71514A is\ndeeply ambiguous. Three indicators of Congress\u2019 intent\nclearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A: the statute\u2019s headings, the statutory\ncontext, and the absurd results that follow from the major-\nity\u2019s interpretation.\n                                  A\n    The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring\nthat the \u201c \u2018relevant syntactic elements\u2019 \u201d of \u00a71514A are that\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cno . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 9.

But \u00a71514A(a) actu-\nally provides that \u201c[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer,\nemployee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such\ncompany . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,\nharass, or in any other manner discriminate against an\nemployee.\u201d The provision thus does not speak only (or\neven primarily) to \u201ccontractors.\u201d It speaks to public com-\npanies, and then includes a list of five types of representa-\ntives that companies hire to carry out their business:\n\u201cofficer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s],\n[and] agent[s].\u201d\n   Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The major-\nity is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause\nof action both for employees of public companies and for\nemployees of the enumerated public company representa-\ntives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to\nprohibit the public company and the listed representa-\ntives\u2014all of whom act on the company\u2019s behalf\u2014from\nretaliating against just the public company\u2019s employees.\n   The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense\nwhen one considers the other terms in the list of com-\npany representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a\nmatter of \u201cgramma[r],\u201d the scope of protected employees\nmust be consistent with respect to all five types of com-\npany representatives listed in \u00a71514A(a).

Fair enough. But Congress could\nmore clearly have dictated the majority\u2019s construction of\nthe statute, too: It could have specified that public compa-\nnies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontrac-\ntors, and agents may not retaliate against \u201ctheir own\nemployees.\u201d In any case, that Congress could have spoken\nwith greater specificity in both directions only underscores\nthat the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous. To\nresolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of\nintent.\n                             B\n  We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a\nstatute\u2019s titles can offer \u201ca useful aid in resolving [the]\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 In\n      reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority rejects the conces-\nsions by the Government and petitioners and gives no weight to the\nARB\u2019s interpretation. If \u00a71514A creates a cause of action for contractor\nemployees, the majority concludes, so too must it create a cause of\naction for \u201chousekeepers\u201d and \u201cgardeners\u201d against their individual\nemployers if they happen to work for a public company. Ante, at 15. In\nreaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities\nproduced by its holding. See infra, at 12\u201313.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Here, two headings strongly suggest that\nCongress intended \u00a71514A to apply only to employees of\npublic companies. First, the title of \u00a7806\u2014the section of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted \u00a71514A\u2014speaks\nclearly to the scope of employees protected by the provi-\nsion: \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\u201d 116 Stat. 802.\nSecond, the heading of \u00a71514A(a) reinforces that the pro-\nvision provides \u201c[w]histleblower protection for employees\nof publicly traded companies.\u201d\n   The majority suggests that in covering \u201cemployees of\npublicly traded companies,\u201d the headings may be impre-\ncise. Ante, at 16. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to\nthe employees of two types of companies: those \u201cwith a\nclass of securities registered under section 12 of the Secu-\nrities Exchange Act of 1934,\u201d and those that are \u201crequired\nto file reports under section 15(d) of the\u201d same Act. Both\ntypes of companies are \u201cpublic\u201d in that they are publicly\nowned. See ante, at 7\u20138. The difference is that shares of\nthe \u00a712 companies are listed and traded on a national\nsecurities exchange; \u00a715(d) companies, by contrast, ex-\nchange their securities directly with the public. The head-\nings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase\n\u201cpublicly traded\u201d is commonly associated with companies\nwhose securities are traded on national exchanges. Con-\ngress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer\nto \u00a715(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are\ntraded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic\nexample of a \u00a715(d) company. And mutual funds, like\nother \u00a715(d) companies, are both publicly owned and\nwidely traded; the trades just take place typically between\nthe fund and its investors directly.\n   In any case, even if referring to employees of \u00a712 and\n\u00a715(d) companies together as \u201cemployees of publicly traded\n6                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncompanies\u201d may be slightly imprecise, the majority\u2019s com-\npeting interpretation of \u00a71514A would stretch the stat-\nute\u2019s headings far past the point of recognition. As the\nmajority understands the law, Congress used the term\n\u201cemployees of publicly traded companies\u201d as shorthand not\njust for (1) employees of \u00a712 and \u00a715(d) companies, but\nalso for (2) household employees of any individual who\nworks for a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) company; (3) employees of any\nprivate company that contracts with a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) com-\npany; (4) employees of any private company that, even if\nit does not contract with a public company, subcontracts\nwith a private company that does; and (5) employees of\nany agent of a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) company. If Congress had\nwanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would\nhave called it something other than \u201c[w]histleblower\nprotection for employees of publicly traded companies.\u201d\n    Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are\ninconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes\nthat the Court has \u201cplaced less weight on captions.\u201d Ante,\nat 16. But where the captions favor one interpretation so\ndecisively, their significance should not be dismissed so\nquickly. As we have explained, headings are important\n\u201c \u2018tools available for the resolution of a doubt\u2019 about the\nmeaning of a statute.\u201d Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U.

Congress stated in the\nAct\u2019s preamble that its objective was to \u201cprotect investors\nby improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate\ndisclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,\u201d 116\nStat. 745, disclosures that public companies alone must\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfile. The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations\nfor public companies, \u00a7401; added new conflict of interest\nrules for their executives, \u00a7402; increased the responsibili-\nties of their audit committees, \u00a7301; and created new rules\ngoverning insider trading by their executives and direc-\ntors, \u00a7306. The common denominator among all of these\nprovisions is their singular focus on the activities of public\ncompanies.\n   When Congress wanted to depart from the Act\u2019s public\ncompany focus to regulate private firms and their employ-\nees, it spoke clearly. For example, \u00a7307 of the Act ordered\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue\nrules \u201csetting forth minimum standards of professional\nconduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the\n[SEC],\u201d including a rule requiring outside counsel to re-\nport violations of the securities laws to public company\nofficers and directors. 15 U. S. C. \u00a77245. Similarly, Title I\nof the Act created the Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board (PCAOB) and vested it with the authority\nto register, regulate, investigate, and discipline privately\nheld outside accounting firms and their employees.\n\u00a7\u00a77211\u20137215. And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules\ngoverning outside securities analysts when they make\npublic recommendations regarding securities. \u00a778o\u20136.\n   Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously\ncover the employees of private businesses that contract\nwith public companies or the employees of individuals who\nwork for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons\nnoted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\ndemonstrates, if Congress had really wanted \u00a71514A to\nimpose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it\nwould have said so more clearly.\n   Congress\u2019 intent to adopt the narrower understanding of\n\u00a71514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the\nwhistleblower provision that served as its model. That\nprovision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation\n8                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nInvestment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, 49\nU. S. C. \u00a742121, provides that \u201c[n]o air carrier or contrac-\ntor or subcontractor of an air carrier\u201d may retaliate\nagainst an employee who reports a potential airline safety\nviolation.\n  Section 42121 protects employees of contractors. But as\nthe majority acknowledges, \u201cCongress strayed\u201d from\n\u00a742121 in significant ways when it wrote \u00a71514A. Ante,\nat 29. First, \u00a742121 specifically defines the term \u201ccon-\ntractor,\u201d limiting the term to \u201ca company that performs\nsafety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.\u201d\n\u00a742121(e). That is in notable distinction to \u00a71514A, which\ndoes not define the word \u201ccontractor\u201d as a particular type\nof company, instead placing the term in a list alongside\nindividual \u201cofficer[s]\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d who act on a\ncompany\u2019s behalf. Second, unlike \u00a742121, \u00a71514A sets off\nthe term \u201ccontractor\u201d in a separate clause that is subsidi-\nary to the primary subject of the provision\u2014the public\ncompany itself. Third, the title of \u00a742121 is \u201c[p]rotection of\nemployees providing air safety information,\u201d a title that\ncomfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.\nNot so of \u00a71514A\u2019s headings, as explained above. In short,\n\u00a742121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if\nit wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet\nchose to depart from that model in several important\nways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental.\nSee Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S.\n723, 734 (1975).\n                             2\n   The majority relies on statutory context as well, but its\nexamples are unconvincing. It first argues that the types\nof conduct prohibited by the statute\u2014\u201cdischarge, demo-\ntion, suspension, threats, harassment, [and] discrimina-\ntion in the terms and conditions of employment\u201d\u2014are\n\u201ccommonly actions an employer takes against its own\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

The problem is that \u00a71514A does\nnot forbid retaliation by an \u201cemployer\u201d; it forbids retalia-\ntion by a \u201c[public] company . . . or any officer, employee,\ncontractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.\u201d For\nthe reasons already discussed, Congress could have rea-\nsonably included the five types of representatives not in\ntheir capacity as employers, but rather as representatives\nof the company who are barred from retaliating against a\npublic company\u2019s employees on the company\u2019s behalf.\n   The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely\n\u201cpositioned to take adverse actions against employees of\nthe public company with whom they contract.\u201d Ante, at\n10. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces,\nwhich increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and\npersons laboring under more typical employment relation-\nships. For example, public companies often hire \u201cinde-\npendent contractors,\u201d of whom there are more than 10\nmillion,3 and contract workers,4 of whom there are more\nthan 11 million.5 And they employ outside lawyers, ac-\ncountants, and auditors as well.

Otherwise, the statute would have had a\ngaping hole\u2014a public company could evade \u00a71514A simply\nby hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory\nacts that an officer or employee could not.6\n  The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence\nof \u201coutplacement\u201d firms, or consultants that help compa-\nnies determine whom to fire.

It surely does, but that is the point\u2014\nthe whole reason \u00a71514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly\nforbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through\n\u201cany officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.\u201d The prohi-\nbition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain\n(hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to\nretaliate through its \u201cofficers and employees.\u201d Moreover, while the\nmajority concedes that, under the narrower reading of \u00a71514A, Con-\ngress\u2019 inclusion of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d imposes secondary liability in\nthe event a public company is judgment proof, ante, at 13, the majority\nfails to recognize that Congress\u2019 use of the term also imposes primary\nliability against contractors who threaten public company employees\nwithout direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR\u2019s inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A would prevent an outside accountant from threat-\nening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the\naccountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the\nwhistle on that fraud.\n   7 Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010,\n\nwww.slate.com / articles / news_and_politics / explainer/2010/01/getting_\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

See,\ne.g., Kalkunte v.

Ante, at\n13. But there is no requirement that a statute must make\nevery type of remedy available against every type of de-\nfendant. A contractor can compensate a whistleblower\nwith backpay, costs, and fees, and that is more than\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe_ax_from_george_clooney.html.\n   8 The majority suggests that an outplacement firm would likely be\n\nacting as an \u201cagent\u201d for the public company, such that Congress\u2019\nadditional inclusion of the word \u201ccontractor\u201d would be superfluous\nunder the narrower reading of \u00a71514A. Ante, at 11, n. 9. The two\nwords are not legally synonymous, however. An outplacement firm and\npublic company might, for example, enter into a contract with a provi-\nsion expressly disclaiming an agency relationship. Moreover, Congress\u2019\nuse of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d would in all events have an independent\nand important effect: If Congress had not included the term, no one\ncould be held liable if a contractor were to threaten or harass a public\ncompany employee without the company\u2019s direction. While the major-\nity may speculate that such occurrences are rare, ibid., it is hardly\nunthinkable. See n. 6, supra.\n12                   LAWSON v.

There is no rule that Congress may only\nprovide an affirmative defense if it is available to every\nconceivable defendant.\n                              D\n                              1\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s reading runs afoul of the precept\nthat \u201cinterpretations of a statute which would produce\nabsurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpreta-\ntions consistent with the legislative purpose are avail-\nable.\u201d Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564,\n575 (1982). The majority\u2019s interpretation transforms\n\u00a71514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress\ncould not have intended. As construed by the majority,\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relation-\nships between individuals and their nannies, housekeep-\ners, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to\nlitigation if their employees claim to have been harassed\nfor providing information regarding any of a host of of-\nfenses. If, for example, a nanny is discharged after ex-\npressing a concern to his employer that the employer\u2019s\nteenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud,\nthe nanny can bring a \u00a71514A suit. The employer may\nprevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired\n\u201cbecause of\u201d the fraud report. \u00a71514A. But there is little\nreason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes\ninto federal court.\n   Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to\nimpose costly litigation burdens on any private business\nthat happens to have an ongoing contract with a public\ncompany.

Yet the majority might well embroil\nfederal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane\nlabor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.\nFor instance, a construction worker could file a \u00a71514A\nsuit against her employer (that has a long-term contract\nwith a public company) if the worker is demoted after\nreporting that another client has mailed the company a\nfalse invoice.9\n   The majority\u2019s interpretation also produces truly odd\ndistinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter\ncan bring a \u00a71514A retaliation suit against his employer\nif his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart\n(a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the\nlocal Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer\nwho works for a construction business can avail himself of\n\u00a71514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the\nlocal Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but\nnot if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private\ncompany).\n   In light of the reasonable alternative reading of \u00a71514A,\nthere is no reason to accept these absurd results. The\nmajority begs to differ, arguing that \u201c[t]here is scant evi-\ndence\u201d that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude\nof newly covered employees \u201c \u2018who have no exposure to\ninvestor-related activities and thus could not possibly\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Recognizing that the majority\u2019s reading would lead to a \u201cnotably\n\nexpansive scope untethered to the purpose of the statute,\u201d the District\nCourt in this case sought to impose an extratextual limiting principle\nunder which an employee who reports fraud is entitled to protection\nonly if her report \u201crelat[es] to fraud against shareholders.\u201d 724\nF.

So the fact that\nindividuals and private businesses have yet to suffer\nburdensome litigation offers little assurance that the ma-\njority\u2019s capacious reading of \u00a71514A will produce no un-\ntoward effects.\n  Finally, it must be noted that \u00a71514A protects the re-\nporting of a variety of frauds\u2014not only securities fraud,\nbut also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a\nstatute that already protects an expansive class of conduct\nalso to cover a large class of employees, today\u2019s opinion\nthreatens to subject private companies to a costly new\nfront of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly\ndid not intend the statute to have that reach.\n                             2\n   The majority argues that the broader reading of \u00a71514A\nis necessary because a small number of the millions of\nindividuals and private companies affected by its ruling\nhave a special role to play in preventing public company\nfraud. If \u00a71514A does not bar retaliation against employ-\nees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms\nand accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their\nemployees when those employees report fraud on the part\nof their public company clients.\n   It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role\nthat outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron\ndebacle and the importance of encouraging them to play\n                  Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           15\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nan active part in preventing future scandals. But it hardly\nfollows that Congress must have meant to apply \u00a71514A to\nevery employee of every public company contractor, sub-\ncontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more\nlikely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and\nprofessional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and\naccountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the\nhands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.\n   Specifically, rather than imposing \u00a71514A\u2019s generic\napproach on outside accounting firms, Congress estab-\nlished the PCAOB, which regulates \u201cevery detail\u201d of an\naccounting firm\u2019s practice, including \u201csupervision of au-\ndit work,\u201d \u201cinternal inspection procedures,\u201d \u201cprofessional\nethics rules,\u201d and \u201c \u2018such other requirements as the Board\nmay prescribe.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 3\u20134). Importantly, the PCAOB is empowered to\nlevy \u201csevere sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to\nand including the permanent revocation of a firm\u2019s regis-\ntration . . . and money penalties of $15 million.\u201d Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 4) (citing 15 U. S. C. \u00a77215(c)(4)). Such sanc-\ntions could well provide a more powerful incentive to\nprevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its\nemployees than \u00a71514A.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory\nauthority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys. The\nAct requires the SEC to establish rules of professional\nconduct for attorneys, \u00a7307 (codified at 15 U. S. C. \u00a77245),\nand confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys\nfor \u201cimproper professional conduct,\u201d which would include,\nfor example, a law firm partner\u2019s decision to retaliate\nagainst an associate who reports fraud. \u00a7602 (codified at\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778d\u20133). Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the\npower to censure culpable attorneys and to deny \u201cperma-\nnently\u201d to any such attorney the \u201cprivilege of appearing of\npracticing before\u201d the SEC \u201cin any way.\u201d \u00a7602.\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   Congress thus evidently made the judgment that deci-\nsions concerning how best to punish law firms and ac-\ncounting firms ought to be handled not by the Department\nof Labor, but by the SEC and the PCAOB. Such judgment\nshould not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much\nless at the cost to congressional intent produced by today\u2019s\nruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments\nfor why Congress might have been wiser to include certain\ntypes of contractors within \u00a71514A, noting for example\nthat a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retali-\nate against its employees for making reports required\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Ante, at 19. But as the\nmajority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that\nprecise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower\nincentive and protection program that unequivocally\n\u201cprohibit[s] any employer\u201d\u2014public or private\u2014\u201cfrom re-\ntaliating against \u2018a whistleblower\u2019 for providing infor-\nmation to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or\nmaking disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-\nOxley and certain other securities laws.\u201d Ante, at 26\n(citing 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a778u\u20136(a)(6), (b)(1), (h)). The majority\nthus acknowledges that, moving forward, retaliation\nclaims like the petitioners\u2019 may \u201cprocee[d] under [\u00a778u-6],\u201d\nante, at 26, n. 17. In other words, to the extent the major-\nity worries about a \u201chole\u201d in FMR\u2019s interpretation, ante,\nat 14, Congress has already addressed it.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  10 The majority also contends that its reading is necessary to avoid\n\u201cinsulating the entire mutual fund industry from \u00a71514A.\u201d Ante, at 20.\nBut that argument is misguided for a reason similar to the majority\u2019s\nconcern about lawyers and accountants. As this Court has observed,\nCongress responded to the \u201c \u2018potential for abuse inherent in the struc-\nture of investment companies,\u2019 \u201d Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464\nU.

S. A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984).11\nUnder United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 226\u2013\n227 (2001), an agency may claim Chevron deference \u201cwhen\nit appears [1] that Congress delegated authority to the\nagency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,\nand [2] that the agency interpretation claiming deference\nwas promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d Nei-\nther requirement is met here.\n   First, the agency interpretation for which petitioners\nclaim deference is the position announced by the ARB, the\nboard to which the Secretary of Labor has delegated au-\nthority \u201cin review or on appeal\u201d in connection with \u00a71514A\nproceedings. 75 Fed. Reg. 3924 (2010). According to\npetitioners, the ARB\u2019s rulings are entitled to deference\nbecause the \u201cSecretary is responsible for enforcing Section\n1514A both through investigation and through formal\nadjudication.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far\nas it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a780b\u201311. The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five\nyears for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to\npunish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their\nemployees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insuffi-\ncient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, \u00a778u\u20136\u2019s extensive\nwhistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously\ncovers such employees.\n   11 Although it claims not to reach the issue, ante, at 9, n. 6, the major-\n\nity implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB\u2019s ruling as well,\nrejecting the ARB\u2019s ruling that \u00a71514A does not apply to the household\nemployees of public company officers and employees, ante, at 15, and\nn. 11.\n18                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvestigate and adjudicate \u00a71514A claims, Congress did not\ndelegate authority to the Secretary to \u201cmake rules carry-\ning the force of law,\u201d Mead, 533 U. S., at 226\u2013227. Con-\ngress instead delegated that power to the SEC: Section\n3(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a77202(a), provides that the SEC \u201cshall promulgate such\nrules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate\nin the public interest or for the protection of investors, and\nin furtherance of this Act.\u201d So if any agency has the au-\nthority to resolve ambiguities in \u00a71514A with the force\nof law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.\nSee Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm\u2019n, 499 U. S. 144, 154 (1991). The SEC, however, has\nnot issued a regulation applying \u00a71514A whistleblower\nprotection to employees of public company contractors.\nAnd while the majority notes that the SEC may share the\n(incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has inter-\npretive authority regarding \u00a71514A, ante, at 9, n. 6, the\nmajority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may\ntransfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Con-\ngress to a different agency simply by signing onto an\namicus brief.\n   That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to re-\nsolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by \u00a71514A\u2019s\nmechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely\npermit courts to review the Secretary\u2019s final adjudicatory\nrulings under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s defer-\nential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an\naction in a federal district court, and allows district courts\nto adjudicate such actions de novo, in any case where the\nSecretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.\nThat is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of\nthe three-tiered process of agency review of \u00a71514A\nclaims. See ante, at 5\u20136. As a result, even if Congress had\nnot delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambigui-\nties in \u00a71514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts,\nand not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power. See\nMead, 533 U. S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs\nService classifications where, among other things, the\nstatute authorized \u201cindependent review of Customs classi-\nfications by the [Court of International Trade]\u201d).\n   As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress\nhad delegated authority to the Secretary to make \u201crules\ncarrying the force of law,\u201d the \u201cagency interpretation\nclaiming deference\u201d in this case was not \u201cpromulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.\u201d Id., at 226\u2013227. That is\nbecause the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymak-\ning authority he may have with respect to \u00a71514A in the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\ninstead of the ARB. See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002). In\nfact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB\nany power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s behalf. 75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (\u201cThe\n[ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of\nany portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has\nbeen duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and\nshall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in\nits decisions\u201d).\n   OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the\nmajority\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A. See 29 CFR \u00a71980.101(f )\u2013(g)\n(2013). The Secretary, however, has expressly disclaimed\nany claim of deference to them. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 33, n. 8. As a result, the ARB\u2019s\nunderstanding of \u00a71514A\u2019s coverage in Spinner was not an\n\u201cexercise of [the Secretary\u2019s] authority\u201d to make rules\ncarrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U. S., at 226\u2013227, but\nrather the ARB\u2019s necessary compliance with a regulation\nthat no one claims is deserving of deference in the first\nplace. See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, at 10 (recog-\nnizing that \u201cthe ARB is bound by the [Department of\nLabor] regulations\u201d).\n20                  LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  In the absence of Chevron deference, the ARB\u2019s decision\nin Spinner may claim only \u201crespect according to its per-\nsuasiveness\u201d under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). See Mead, 533 U. S., at 221. But the ARB\u2019s\ndecision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already\ndiscussed.\n                        *    *     *\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71514A undeniably serves\na laudatory purpose. By covering employees of every of-\nficer, employee, and contractor of every public company,\nthe majority\u2019s interpretation extends \u00a71514A\u2019s protections\nto the outside lawyers and accountants who could have\nhelped prevent the Enron fraud.\n   But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress\nenvisioned a system in which public company employees\nwould be covered by \u00a71514A, and in which outside law-\nyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be\nregulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not\nenvision a system in which employees of other private\nbusinesses\u2014such as cleaning and construction company\nworkers who have little interaction with investor-related\nactivities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting\nfraud against shareholders\u2014would fall within \u00a71514A.\nNor, needless to say, did it envision \u00a71514A applying to\nthe household employees of millions of individuals who\nhappen to work for public companies\u2014housekeepers,\ngardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned\nto prevent fraud against public company investors. And to\nthe extent \u00a71514A may have been underinclusive as first\ndrafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any\ngaps. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-\nsumer Protection Act, \u00a7\u00a7922, 929A, 124 Stat. 1848, 1852\n(extending \u00a71514A to credit rating agencies and public\ncompany subsidiaries); \u00a7922, id., at 1841\u20131848 (codifying\nadditional whistleblower incentive and protection program\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Fortunately, just as Congress has added further\nprotections to the system it originally designed when\nnecessary, so too may Congress now respond to limit the\nfar-reaching implications of the Court\u2019s interpretation.12\nBut because that interpretation relies on a debatable view\nof \u00a71514A\u2019s text, is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s titles\nand its context, and leads to absurd results that Congress\ndid not intend, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Congress could, for example, limit \u00a71514A to contractor employees\n\nin only those professions that can assist in detecting fraud on public\ncompany shareholders, or it could restrict the fraud reports that trigger\nwhistleblower protection to those that implicate the interests of public\ncompany investors, see n. 9, supra.\n",

Argued November 12, 2013\u2014Decided March 4, 2014\nTo safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the\n  financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation, Con-\n  gress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. One of the Act\u2019s provi-\n  sions protects whistleblowers; at the time relevant here, that provi-\n  sion instructed: \u201cNo [public] company . . ., or any . . . contractor [or]\n  subcontractor . . . of such company, may discharge, demote, suspend,\n  threaten, harass, or . . . discriminate against an employee in the\n  terms and conditions of employment because of [whistleblowing activ-\n  ity].\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A(a).\n     Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees of respond-\n  ents (collectively FMR), private companies that contract to advise or\n  manage mutual funds. As is common in the industry, the mutual\n  funds served by FMR are public companies with no employees. Both\n  plaintiffs allege that they blew the whistle on putative fraud relating\n  to the mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered retaliation by\n  FMR. Each commenced suit in federal court. Moving to dismiss the\n  suits, FMR argued that the plaintiffs could state no claim under\n  \u00a71514A, for that provision protects only employees of public compa-\n  nies, and not employees of private companies that contract with pub-\n  lic companies. On interlocutory appeal from the District Court\u2019s de-\n  nial of FMR\u2019s motion to dismiss, the First Circuit reversed,\n  concluding that the term \u201can employee\u201d in \u00a71514A(a) refers only to\n  employees of public companies.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded.\n670 F. 3d 61, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court, concluding that\n  \u00a71514A\u2019s whistleblower protection includes employees of a public\n2                          LAWSON v.

Pp. 9\u201329.\n       (a) This reading of \u00a71514A is supported by the provision\u2019s text.\n    Pp. 9\u201316.\n         (1) The Court looks first to the ordinary meaning of the provi-\n    sion\u2019s language. See Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108. As\n    relevant here, \u00a71514A(a) provides that \u201cno . . . contractor . . . may dis-\n    charge . . . an employee.\u201d The ordinary meaning of \u201can employee\u201d in\n    this proscription is the contractor\u2019s own employee. FMR\u2019s \u201cnarrower\n    construction\u201d requires inserting \u201cof a public company\u201d after \u201can em-\n    ployee,\u201d but where Congress meant \u201can employee of a public compa-\n    ny,\u201d it said so.\n       The provision as a whole supports this reading. The prohibited re-\n    taliatory measures enumerated in \u00a71514A(a)\u2014discharge, demotion,\n    suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination in employment\n    terms and conditions\u2014are actions an employer takes against its own\n    employees. Contractors are not ordinarily positioned to take adverse\n    actions against employees of the public company with whom they\n    contract. FMR\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71514A, therefore, would shrink to\n    insignificance the provision\u2019s ban on retaliation by contractors. The\n    protected activity covered by \u00a71514A, and the provision\u2019s enforcement\n    procedures and remedies, also indicate that Congress presumed an\n    employer-employee relationship between the retaliator and the whis-\n    tleblowing employee. Pp. 9\u201314.\n         (2) FMR\u2019s textual arguments are unpersuasive. It urges that \u201can\n    employee\u201d must be read to refer exclusively to public company em-\n    ployees to avoid the absurd result of extending protection to the per-\n    sonal employees of company officers and employees, e.g., their house-\n    keepers or gardeners. This concern appears more theoretical than\n    real and, in any event, is outweighed by the compelling arguments\n    opposing FMR\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A. FMR also urges that its reading\n    is supported by the provision\u2019s statutory headings, but those head-\n    ings are \u201cnot meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the\n    text.\u201d Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519, 528.\n    Pp. 14\u201316.\n       (b) Other considerations support the Court\u2019s textual analysis.\n    Pp. 16\u201327.\n         (1) The Court\u2019s reading fits \u00a71514A\u2019s aim to ward off another En-\n    ron debacle. The legislative record shows Congress\u2019 understanding\n    that outside professionals bear significant responsibility for reporting\n    fraud by the public companies with whom they contract, and that\n    fear of retaliation was the primary deterrent to such reporting by the\n    employees of Enron\u2019s contractors. Sarbanes-Oxley contains numer-\n    ous provisions designed to control the conduct of accountants, audi-\n    tors, and lawyers who work with public companies, but only \u00a71514A\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Pp. 16\u201320.\n        (2) This Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A avoids insulating the entire\n  mutual fund industry from \u00a71514A. Virtually all mutual funds are\n  structured so that they have no employees of their own; they are\n  managed, instead, by independent investment advisors. Accordingly,\n  the \u201cnarrower construction\u201d endorsed by FMR would leave \u00a71514A\n  with no application to mutual funds. The Court\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A,\n  in contrast, protects the employees of investment advisors, who are\n  often the only firsthand witnesses to shareholder fraud involving mu-\n  tual funds. Pp. 20\u201322.\n        (3) There is scant evidence that today\u2019s decision will open any\n  floodgates for whistleblowing suits outside \u00a71514A\u2019s purposes. The\n  Department of Labor\u2019s regulations have interpreted \u00a71514A as pro-\n  tecting contractor employees for almost a decade, yet FMR is unable\n  to identify a single case in which the employee of a private contractor\n  has asserted a \u00a71514A claim based on allegations unrelated to share-\n  holder fraud. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General suggest various\n  limiting principles to dispel any overbreadth problems. This Court\n  need not determine \u00a71514A\u2019s bounds here, however, because, if plain-\n  tiffs\u2019 allegations prove true, plaintiffs are precisely the \u201cfirsthand\n  witnesses to [the shareholder] fraud\u201d Congress anticipated \u00a71514A\n  would protect.

ZANG,\n        PETITIONERS v. FMR LLC ET AL.\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n             APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT\n                                [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  To safeguard investors in public companies and restore\ntrust in the financial markets following the collapse of\nEnron Corporation, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. See S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146,\npp. 2\u201311 (2002). A provision of the Act, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71514A, protects whistleblowers. Section 1514A, at the\ntime here relevant, instructed:\n    \u201cNo [public] company . . . , or any officer, employee,\n    contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company,\n    may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,\n    or in any other manner discriminate against an em-\n    ployee in the terms and conditions of employment be-\n    cause of [whistleblowing or other protected activity].\u201d\n    \u00a71514A(a) (2006 ed.).\nThis case concerns the definition of the protected class:\nDoes \u00a71514A shield only those employed by the public\ncompany itself, or does it shield as well employees of pri-\nvately held contractors and subcontractors\u2014for example,\ninvestment advisers, law firms, accounting enterprises\u2014\nwho perform work for the public company?\n2                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   We hold, based on the text of \u00a71514A, the mischief to\nwhich Congress was responding, and earlier legislation\nCongress drew upon, that the provision shelters employees\nof private contractors and subcontractors, just as it shel-\nters employees of the public company served by the con-\ntractors and subcontractors. We first summarize our\nprincipal reasons, then describe this controversy and\nexplain our decision more comprehensively.\n   Plaintiffs below, petitioners here, are former employees\nof private companies that contract to advise or manage\nmutual funds. The mutual funds themselves are public\ncompanies that have no employees. Hence, if the whistle\nis to be blown on fraud detrimental to mutual fund inves-\ntors, the whistleblowing employee must be on another\ncompany\u2019s payroll, most likely, the payroll of the mutual\nfund\u2019s investment adviser or manager.\n   Taking the allegations of the complaint as true, both\nplaintiffs blew the whistle on putative fraud relating to\nthe mutual funds and, as a consequence, suffered adverse\naction by their employers. Plaintiffs read \u00a71514A to con-\nvey that \u201c[n]o . . . contractor . . . may . . . discriminate\nagainst [its own] employee [for whistleblowing].\u201d We find\nthat reading consistent with the text of the statute and\nwith common sense. Contractors are in control of their\nown employees, but are not ordinarily positioned to control\nsomeone else\u2019s workers. Moreover, we resist attributing to\nCongress a purpose to stop a contractor from retaliating\nagainst whistleblowers employed by the public company\nthe contractor serves, while leaving the contractor free to\nretaliate against its own employees when they reveal\ncorporate fraud.\n   In the Enron scandal that prompted the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, contractors and subcontractors, including the ac-\ncounting firm Arthur Andersen, participated in Enron\u2019s\nfraud and its coverup. When employees of those contrac-\ntors attempted to bring misconduct to light, they encoun-\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntered retaliation by their employers. The Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct contains numerous provisions aimed at controlling the\nconduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work\nwith public companies. See, e.g., 116 Stat. 750\u2013765, 773\u2013\n774, 784, \u00a7\u00a7101\u2013107, 203\u2013206, 307. Given Congress\u2019\nconcern about contractor conduct of the kind that contrib-\nuted to Enron\u2019s collapse, we regard with suspicion con-\nstruction of \u00a71514A to protect whistleblowers only when\nthey are employed by a public company, and not when\nthey work for the public company\u2019s contractor.\n   Congress borrowed \u00a71514A\u2019s prohibition against retalia-\ntion from the wording of the 2000 Wendell H. Ford Avia-\ntion Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR\n21), 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121. That Act provides: \u201cNo air carrier\nor contractor or subcontractor of an air carrier may dis-\ncharge an employee or otherwise discriminate against an\nemployee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions,\nor privileges of employment\u201d when the employee provides\ninformation regarding violations \u201crelating to air carrier\nsafety\u201d to his or her employer or federal authorities.\n\u00a742121(a)(1). AIR 21 has been read to cover, in addition to\nemployees of air carriers, employees of contractors and\nsubcontractors of the carriers. Given the parallel statu-\ntory texts and whistleblower protective aims, we read\nthe words \u201can employee\u201d in AIR 21 and in \u00a71514A to have\nsimilar import.\n                            I\n\n                           A\n\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley or Act)\naims to \u201cprevent and punish corporate and criminal fraud,\nprotect the victims of such fraud, preserve evidence of\nsuch fraud, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their\nactions.\u201d S. Rep. No. 107\u2013146, p. 2 (2002) (hereinafter\n4                       LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nS. Rep.).1 Of particular concern to Congress was abundant\nevidence that Enron had succeeded in perpetuating its\nmassive shareholder fraud in large part due to a \u201ccorpo-\nrate code of silence\u201d; that code, Congress found, \u201cdiscour-\nage[d] employees from reporting fraudulent behavior not\nonly to the proper authorities, such as the FBI and the\nSEC, but even internally.\u201d Id., at 4\u20135 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). When employees of Enron and its ac-\ncounting firm, Arthur Andersen, attempted to report\ncorporate misconduct, Congress learned, they faced retali-\nation, including discharge. As outside counsel advised\ncompany officials at the time, Enron\u2019s efforts to \u201cquiet\u201d\nwhistleblowers generally were not proscribed under then-\nexisting law. Id., at 5, 10. Congress identified the lack of\nwhistleblower protection as \u201ca significant deficiency\u201d in\nthe law, for in complex securities fraud investigations,\nemployees \u201care [often] the only firsthand witnesses to the\nfraud.\u201d Id., at 10.\n  Section 806 of Sarbanes-Oxley addresses this concern.\nTitled \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud,\u201d \u00a7806 added a new\nprovision to Title 18 of the United States Code, 18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71514A, which reads in relevant part:\n     \u201cCivil action to protect against retaliation in\n     fraud cases\n     \u201c(a) WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 Title VIII of the Act, which contains the whistleblower protection\n\nprovision at issue in this case, was authored by Senators Leahy and\nGrassley and originally constituted a discrete bill, S. 2010.

Plaintiffs do not fall in either category and, in any\nevent, their claims are governed by the prior version of \u00a71514A.

Reg. 3912 (2012), the\nARB\u2019s determination on a \u00a71514A claim constitutes the\nagency\u2019s final decision and is reviewable in federal court\nunder the standards stated in the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, 5 U. S. C. \u00a7706. If, however, the ARB does not\nissue a final decision within 180 days of the filing of the\ncomplaint, and the delay is not due to bad faith on the\nclaimant\u2019s part, the claimant may proceed to federal dis-\ntrict court for de novo review. 18 U.

Instead, they contract with investment\nadvisers like respondents to handle their day-to-day oper-\nations, which include making investment decisions, pre-\nparing reports for shareholders, and filing reports with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Lawson was\nemployed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidi-\nary of FMR Corp., which was succeeded by FMR LLC.\nZang was employed by a different FMR LLC subsidiary,\nFidelity Management & Research Co., and later by one of\nthat company\u2019s subsidiaries, FMR Co., Inc. For conven-\nience, we refer to respondents collectively as FMR.\n   Lawson worked for FMR for 14 years, eventually serv-\ning as a Senior Director of Finance. She alleges that, after\nshe raised concerns about certain cost accounting method-\nologies, believing that they overstated expenses associated\nwith operating the mutual funds, she suffered a series\nof adverse actions, ultimately amounting to constructive\ndischarge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years,\nmost recently as a portfolio manager for several of the\nfunds. He alleges that he was fired in retaliation for\nraising concerns about inaccuracies in a draft SEC reg-\nistration statement concerning certain Fidelity funds.\nLawson and Zang separately filed administrative com-\nplaints alleging retaliation proscribed by \u00a71514A. After\nexpiration of the 180-day period specified in \u00a71514A(b)(1),\nLawson and Zang each filed suit in the U. S.

The Court of Ap-\npeals majority acknowledged that FMR is a \u201ccontractor\u201d4\nwithin the meaning of \u00a71514A(a), and thus among the\nactors prohibited from retaliating against \u201can employee\u201d\nwho engages in protected activity. The majority agreed\nwith FMR, however, that \u201can employee\u201d refers only to\nemployees of public companies and does not cover a con-\ntractor\u2019s own employees. Id., at 68\u201380. Judge Thompson\ndissented. In her view, the majority had \u201cimpose[d] an\nunwarranted restriction on the intentionally broad lan-\nguage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d and \u201cbar[red] a signifi-\ncant class of potential securities-fraud whistleblowers\nfrom any legal protection.\u201d Id., at 83.\n   Several months later, the ARB issued a decision in an\nunrelated case, Spinner v.

The ordinary mean-\ning of \u201can employee\u201d in this proscription is the contractor\u2019s\nown employee.\n  FMR\u2019s interpretation of the text requires insertion of\n\u201cof a public company\u201d after \u201can employee.\u201d But where Con-\ngress meant \u201can employee of a public company,\u201d it said so:\nWith respect to the actors governed by \u00a71514A, the provi-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nthe Department of Labor.\u201d Post, at 18. Because we agree with the\nARB\u2019s conclusion that \u00a71514A affords protection to a contractor\u2019s\nemployees, we need not decide what weight that conclusion should\ncarry. We note, however, that the SEC apparently does not share the\ndissent\u2019s view that it, rather than DOL, has interpretive authority over\n\u00a71514A. To the contrary, the SEC is a signatory to the Government\u2019s\nbrief in this case, which takes the position that Congress has charged\nthe Secretary of Labor with interpreting \u00a71514A. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 9\u201311, 31\u201334. That view is hardly surprising\ngiven the lead role played by DOL in administering whistleblower\nstatutes. See supra, at 5. The dissent observes that the SEC \u201chas\nnot issued a regulation applying \u00a71514A whistleblower protection to\nemployees of public company contractors,\u201d post, at 18, but omits to\ninform that the SEC has not promulgated any regulations interpreting\n\u00a71514A, consistent with its view that Congress delegated that respon-\nsibility to DOL.\n10                    LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                       Opinion of the Court\n\nsion\u2019s interdictions run to the officers, employees, contrac-\ntors, subcontractors, and agents \u201cof such company,\u201d i.e., a\npublic company. \u00a71514A(a). Another anti-retaliation pro-\nvision in Sarbanes-Oxley provides: \u201c[A] broker or dealer\nand persons employed by a broker or dealer who are\ninvolved with investment banking activities may not,\ndirectly or indirectly, retaliate against or threaten to\nretaliate against any securities analyst employed by that\nbroker or dealer or its affiliates . . . .\u201d 15 U. S. C. \u00a778o\u2013\n6(a)(1)(C) (emphasis added). In contrast, nothing in\n\u00a71514A\u2019s language confines the class of employees protected\nto those of a designated employer. Absent any textual\nqualification, we presume the operative language means\nwhat it appears to mean: A contractor may not retaliate\nagainst its own employee for engaging in protected whistle-\nblowing activity.7\n   Section 1514A\u2019s application to contractor employees\nis confirmed when we enlarge our view from the term\n\u201can employee\u201d to the provision as a whole. The prohib-\nited retaliatory measures enumerated in \u00a71514A(a)\u2014\ndischarge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or dis-\ncrimination in the terms and conditions of employment\u2014\nare commonly actions an employer takes against its\nown employees. Contractors are not ordinarily posi-\ntioned to take adverse actions against employees of the\npublic company with whom they contract. FMR\u2019s inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A, therefore, would shrink to insignifi-\ncance the provision\u2019s ban on retaliation by contractors.\nThe dissent embraces FMR\u2019s \u201cnarrower\u201d construction. See\npost, at 2, 3, 4, 7.\n   FMR urges that Congress included contractors in\n\u00a71514A\u2019s list of governed actors simply to prevent public\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  7 We need not decide in this case whether \u00a71514A also prohibits a\n\ncontractor from retaliating against an employee of one of the other\nactors governed by the provision.\n                      Cite as: 571 U.

FMR describes\nsuch a contractor as an \u201cax-wielding specialist,\u201d illustrated\nby George Clooney\u2019s character in the movie Up in the Air.8\nBrief for Respondents 24\u201325 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As portrayed by Clooney, an ax-wielding special-\nist is a contractor engaged only as the bearer of the bad\nnews that the employee has been fired; he plays no role in\ndeciding who to terminate. If the company employing the\nax-wielder chose the recipients of the bad tidings for retal-\niatory reasons, the \u00a71514A claim would properly be di-\nrected at the company. Hiring the ax-wielder would not\ninsulate the company from liability. Moreover, we see no\nindication that retaliatory ax-wielding specialists are the\nreal-world problem that prompted Congress to add con-\ntractors to \u00a71514A.9\n   Moving further through \u00a71514A to the protected activity\ndescribed in subsection (a)(1), we find further reason to\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  8 This hypothetical originates in a Seventh Circuit opinion, Fleszar v.\nUnited States Dept. of Labor, 598 F. 3d 912, 915 (2010), and is men-\ntioned in a footnote in the First Circuit\u2019s opinion in this case, 670 F. 3d\n61, 69, n. 11 (2012).\n   9 When asked during oral argument for an example of actual circum-\n\nstances in which a contractor would have employment decisionmak-\ning authority over public company employees, FMR\u2019s counsel cited\nKalkunte v. DVI Financial Servs., Inc., No. 05\u2013139 etc., ALJ No. 2004\u2013\nSOX\u2013056 (Feb. 27, 2009). Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. That case involved a\nbankrupt public company that hired a private company to handle its\ndissolution. The ARB found the private company liable under \u00a71514A\nbecause it acted as a \u201ccontractor, subcontractor, or agent\u201d of the public\ncompany in discharging the claimant. ALJ No. 2004\u2013SOX\u2013056, at 10\n(emphasis added). Neither FMR nor its amici have pointed us to any\nactual situation in which a public company employee would be vulner-\nable to retaliatory conduct by a contractor not already covered as an\n\u201cagent\u201d under \u00a71514A. Notably, even in Tides v. The Boeing Co., 644\nF. 3d 809 (CA9 2011), the case cited by the dissent for the proposition\nthat contractors may possess \u201cmanagerial authority\u201d over public\ncompany employees, post, at 10, the alleged retaliation was by the\npublic company itself.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nbelieve that Congress presumed an employer-employee\nrelationship between the retaliator and the whistleblower.\nEmployees gain protection for furnishing information to a\nfederal agency, Congress, or \u201ca person with supervisory\nauthority over the employee (or such other person working\nfor the employer who has the authority to investigate,\ndiscover, or terminate misconduct).\u201d \u00a71514A(a)(1) (em-\nphasis added). And under \u00a71514A(a)(2), employees are\nprotected from retaliation for assisting \u201cin a proceeding\nfiled or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the em-\nployer) relating to an alleged violation\u201d of any of the enu-\nmerated fraud provisions, securities regulations, or other\nfederal law relating to shareholder fraud. \u00a71514A(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The reference to employer knowledge is\nan additional indicator of Congress\u2019 expectation that the\nretaliator typically will be the employee\u2019s employer, not\nanother entity less likely to know of whistleblower com-\nplaints filed or about to be filed.\n   Section 1514A\u2019s enforcement procedures and remedies\nsimilarly contemplate that the whistleblower is an em-\nployee of the retaliator. As earlier noted, see supra, at 6,\n\u00a71514A(b)(2)(A) provides that a claim under \u00a71514A \u201cshall\nbe governed under the rules and procedures set forth in\nsection 42121(b) of title 49,\u201d i.e., AIR 21\u2019s anti-retaliation\nprovision. Throughout \u00a742121(b), the respondent is re-\nferred to as \u201cthe employer.\u201d See 49 U. S.

The most\nsensible reading of \u00a71514A\u2019s numerous references to an\nemployer-employee relationship between the respondent\nand the claimant is that the provision\u2019s protections run\nbetween contractors and their own employees.\n   Remarkably, the dissent attributes to Congress a\nstrange design. Under the dissent\u2019s \u201cnarrower\u201d construc-\ntion, post, at 2, 3, 4, 7, a public company\u2019s contractor may\nnot retaliate against a public company\u2019s employees, aca-\ndemic here because the public company has no employees.\nAccording to the dissent, this coverage is necessary to\nprevent \u201ca gaping hole\u201d that would allow public companies\nto \u201cevade \u00a71514A simply by hiring a contractor to engage\nin the very retaliatory acts that an officer or employee\ncould not.\u201d Post, at 10. This cannot be right\u2014even if\nCongress had omitted any reference to contractors, sub-\ncontractors, or agents in \u00a71514A, the remaining language\nsurely would prohibit a public company from directing\nsomeone else to engage in retaliatory conduct against the\npublic company\u2019s employees; hiring an ax-wielder to an-\nnounce an employee\u2019s demotion does not change the fact\nthat the public company is the entity commanding the\ndemotion. Under the dissent\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A, the\ninclusion of contractors as covered employers does no more\nthan make the contractor secondarily liable for complying\nwith such marching orders\u2014hardly a hole at all.10\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   10 The dissent suggests that we \u201cfai[l] to recognize\u201d that its construc-\n\ntion also makes contractors primarily liable for retaliating of their own\n14                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   There would be a huge hole, on the other hand, were the\ndissent\u2019s view of \u00a71514A\u2019s reach to prevail: Contractors\u2019\nemployees would be disarmed; they would be vulnerable\nto retaliation by their employers for blowing the whistle\non a scheme to defraud the public company\u2019s investors,\neven a scheme engineered entirely by the contractor. Not\nonly would mutual fund advisers and managers escape\n\u00a71514A\u2019s control. Legions of accountants and lawyers\nwould be denied \u00a71514A\u2019s protections. See infra, at 19\u201322.\nInstead of indulging in fanciful visions of whistleblowing\nbabysitters and the like, post, at 1\u20132, 6, 12\u201313, 20, the\ndissent might pause to consider whether a Congress,\nprompted by the Enron debacle, would exclude from whis-\ntleblower protection countless professionals equipped to\nbring fraud on investors to a halt.\n                             B\n  We turn next to two textual arguments made by FMR.\nFirst, FMR urges that \u201can employee\u201d must be read to refer\nexclusively to public company employees to avoid the\nabsurd result of extending protection to the personal\nemployees of company officers and employees, e.g., their\nhousekeepers or gardeners. See Brief for Respondents 19\u2013\n20; post, at 1\u20132, 6, 12\u201313, 20. Plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral do not defend \u00a71514A\u2019s application to personal\nemployees. They argue, instead, that the prohibition\nagainst an \u201cofficer\u201d or \u201cemployee\u201d retaliating against \u201can\nemployee\u201d may be read as imposing personal liability only\non officers and employees who retaliate against other\npublic company employees.

As \n\nexplained supra, at 11\u201312, n. 9, however, FMR and its supporters have\n\nidentified not even one real-world instance of a public company employee\n\nasserting a \u00a71514A claim alleging retaliatory conduct by a contractor.\n\nAgain, no \u201cgaping hole,\u201d practically no hole at all.\n\n                    Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                15\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 16.11 FMR calls this\nreading \u201cbizarre,\u201d for it would ascribe to the words \u201can\nemployee\u201d in \u00a71514A(a) \u201cone meaning if the respondent is\nan \u2018officer\u2019 and a different meaning if the respondent is a\n\u2018contractor.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents 20\u201321.\n   We agree with FMR that plaintiffs and the Solicitor\nGeneral offer an interpretation at odds with the text Con-\ngress enacted. If, as we hold, \u201can employee\u201d includes\nemployees of contractors, then grammatically, the term\nalso includes employees of public company officers and\nemployees. Nothing suggests Congress\u2019 attention was\ndrawn to the curiosity its drafting produced. The issue,\nhowever, is likely more theoretical than real. Few house-\nkeepers or gardeners, we suspect, are likely to come upon\nand comprehend evidence of their employer\u2019s complicity in\nfraud. In any event, FMR\u2019s point is outweighed by the\ncompelling arguments opposing FMR\u2019s contention that \u201can\nemployee\u201d refers simply and only to public company em-\nployees. See supra, at 9\u201314. See also infra, at 23\u201324\n(limiting principles may serve as check against overbroad\napplications).\n     Second, FMR argues that the statutory headings\nsupport the exclusion of contractor employees from\n\u00a71514A\u2019s protections. Although \u00a71514A\u2019s own heading is\nbroad (\u201cCivil action to protect against retaliation in fraud\ncases\u201d), subsection (a) is captioned \u201cWhistleblower Protec-\ntion for Employees of Publicly Traded Companies.\u201d Simi-\nlarly, the relevant public law section, \u00a7806 of Sarbanes-\nOxley, is captioned \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly\nTraded Companies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\u201d 116\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   11 The ARB endorsed this view in Spinner v. David Landau & Assoc.,\n\nLLC, No. 10\u2013111 etc., ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, p. 8 (May 31, 2012). We\nhave no occasion to determine whether the ARB would be entitled to\ndeference in this regard, for, as explained in text, we find that the\nstatutory text unambiguously affords protection to personal employees\nof public company officers and employees. \u00a71514A(a).\n16                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nStat. 802. The Court of Appeals described the latter two\nheadings as \u201cexplicit guides\u201d limiting protection under\n\u00a71514A to employees of public companies. 670 F. 3d, at\n69.\n   This Court has placed less weight on captions. In\nTrainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 331 U. S. 519\n(1947), we explained that where, as here, \u201cthe [statutory]\ntext is complicated and prolific, headings and titles can do\nno more than indicate the provisions in a most general\nmanner.\u201d Id., at 528. The under-inclusiveness of the two\nheadings relied on by the Court of Appeals is apparent.\nThe provision indisputably extends protection to employ-\nees of companies that file reports with the SEC pursuant\nto \u00a715(d) of the 1934 Act, even when such companies are\nnot \u201cpublicly traded.\u201d And the activity protected under\n\u00a71514A is not limited to \u201cprovid[ing] evidence of fraud\u201d; it\nalso includes reporting violations of SEC rules or regula-\ntions. \u00a71514A(a)(1). As in Trainmen, the headings here\nare \u201cbut a short-hand reference to the general subject\nmatter\u201d of the provision, \u201cnot meant to take the place of\nthe detailed provisions of the text.\u201d 331 U. S., at 528.\nSection 1514A is attended by numerous indicators that the\nstatute\u2019s prohibitions govern the relationship between a\ncontractor and its own employees; we do not read the\nheadings to \u201cundo or limit\u201d those signals. Id., at 529.12\n                            III\n\n                             A\n\n   Our textual analysis of \u00a71514A fits the provision\u2019s pur-\npose. It is common ground that Congress installed whis-\ntleblower protection in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as one\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 AIR 21\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, on which \u00a71514A is based, in-\n\ncludes a similarly composed heading, \u201cDiscrimination against airline\nemployees.\u201d 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121(a). Nevertheless, that provision has\nbeen read to cover employees of companies rendering contract services\nto airlines. See infra, at 27\u201329.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

And, as the ARB observed in Spinner, \u201cCongress\nplainly recognized that outside professionals\u2014ac-\ncountants, law firms, contractors, agents, and the like\u2014\nwere complicit in, if not integral to, the shareholder fraud\nand subsequent cover-up [Enron] officers . . . perpetrated.\u201d\nALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, pp. 12\u201313.

In\nparticular, FMR points to sections of the Act requiring\naccountants and lawyers for public companies to investi-\ngate and report misconduct, or risk being banned from\nfurther practice before the SEC. Id., at 41 (citing 15\nU. S. C. \u00a7\u00a77215(c)(4), 7245). These requirements, however,\nindicate why Congress would have wanted to extend\n\u00a71514A\u2019s coverage to the many lawyers and accountants\nwho perform outside work for public companies. Although\nlawyers and accountants are subject to extensive regula-\ntions and sanctions throughout Sarbanes-Oxley, no provi-\nsion of the Act other than \u00a71514A affords them protection\nfrom retaliation by their employers for complying with the\nAct\u2019s reporting requirements.14 In short, we cannot coun-\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  13 FMR urges that the Senate Report\u2019s references to \u201cemployees of\n\npublicly traded companies\u201d demonstrate that Congress wanted to limit\nwhistleblower protection to such employees.

This argument fails for the same reason that FMR\u2019s reliance on the\nstatutory section headings fails: \u201cemployees of publicly traded compa-\nnies\u201d must be understood as shorthand not designed to capture every\nemployee covered by \u00a71514A. See supra, at 15\u201316. Senator Sarbanes\u2019\nstatement, cited in the concurring opinion, post, at 2, is similarly\nimprecise. The Act indisputably covers private accounting firms and\nlaw firms that provide services to public companies. See, e.g., 15 U. S.\nC. \u00a7\u00a77215, 7245. Indeed, Senator Sarbanes acknowledged this point in\nhis very next sentence. See 148 Cong. Rec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of\nSen. Sarbanes) (\u201cThis legislation prohibits accounting firms from\nproviding certain specified consulting services if they are also the\nauditors of the company.\u201d).\n  14 The dissent suggests that the Public Company Accounting Oversight\n20                      LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntenance the position advanced by FMR and the dissent,\nsee post, at 14\u201316, that Congress intended to leave these\nprofessionals vulnerable to discharge or other retaliatory\naction for complying with the law.\n                              B\n   Our reading of \u00a71514A avoids insulating the entire\nmutual fund industry from \u00a71514A, as FMR\u2019s and the\ndissent\u2019s \u201cnarrower construction\u201d would do. As companies\n\u201crequired to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securi-\nties Exchange Act of 1934,\u201d 18 U. S. C. \u00a71514A(a), mutual\nfunds unquestionably are governed by \u00a71514A. Because\nmutual funds figure prominently among such report-filing\ncompanies, Congress presumably had them in mind when\nit added to \u201cpublicly traded companies\u201d the discrete cate-\ngory of companies \u201crequired to file reports under section\n15(d).\u201d\n   Virtually all mutual funds are structured so that they\nhave no employees of their own; they are managed, in-\nstead, by independent investment advisers. See S. Rep.\nNo. 91\u2013184, p. 5 (1969) (accompanying the 1970 amend-\nments to the Investment Company Act of 1940). The\nUnited States investment advising industry manages\n$14.7 trillion on behalf of nearly 94 million investors. See\n2013 Investment Company Fact Book 7 (53d ed.), availa-\nble at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf (as\nvisited Feb. 20, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s\ncase file). These investment advisers, under our reading\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n\nBoard\u2019s and the SEC\u2019s authority to sanction unprofessional conduct by \n\naccountants and lawyers, respectively, \u201ccould well provide\u201d a disincen-\ntive to retaliate against other accountants and lawyers. See post, at 15.\n\nThe possibility of such sanctions, however, is cold comfort to the ac-\ncountant or lawyer who loses her job in retaliation for her efforts to \n\ncomply with the Act\u2019s requirements if, as the dissent would have it,\n\n\u00a71514A does not enable her to seek reinstatement or backpay. \n\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

This construction protects the \u201cinsiders [who]\nare the only firsthand witnesses to the [shareholder]\nfraud.\u201d S. Rep., at 10. Under FMR\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s\nreading, in contrast, \u00a71514A has no application to mutual\nfunds, for all of the potential whistleblowers are employed\nby the privately held investment management companies,\nnot by the mutual funds themselves. See Brief for Re-\nspondents 45 (describing this glaring gap as \u201cmerely a\nconsequence of the corporate structure\u201d of mutual funds).\n  The Court of Appeals found exclusion of the mutual\nfund industry from \u00a71514A tenable because mutual funds\nand their investment advisers are separately regulated\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a780a\u20131 et seq., the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15\nU. S. C. \u00a780b\u20131 et seq., and elsewhere in Sarbanes-Oxley.\n670 F. 3d, at 72\u201373. See also post, at 16\u201317, n. 10. But\nthis separate regulation does not remove the problem, for\nnowhere else in these legislative measures are investment\nmanagement employees afforded whistleblower protection.\nSection 1514A alone shields them from retaliation for\nbringing fraud to light.\n  Indeed, affording whistleblower protection to mutual\nfund investment advisers is crucial to Sarbanes-Oxley\u2019s\nendeavor to \u201cprotect investors by improving the accuracy\nand reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to\nthe securities laws.\u201d 116 Stat. 745. As plaintiffs observe,\nthese disclosures are written, not by anyone at the mutual\nfunds themselves, but by employees of the investment\nadvisers. \u201cUnder FMR\u2019s [and the dissent\u2019s] proposed in-\nterpretation of section 1514A, FMR could dismiss any\nFMR employee who disclosed to the directors of or lawyers\nfor the Fidelity funds that there were material falsehoods\nin the documents being filed by FMR with the SEC in the\nname of those funds.\u201d Reply Brief 13.

See post, at 1\u20132, 6,\n12\u201313, 20\u201321. FMR\u2019s amici also press this point, observ-\ning that the activity protected under \u00a71514A(a)(1) encom-\npasses reporting not only securities fraud (18 U. S. C.\n\u00a71348), but also mail, wire, and bank fraud (\u00a7\u00a71341, 1343,\n1344). Including contractor employees in the protected\nclass, they therefore assert, could \u201ccas[t] a wide net over\nemployees who have no exposure to investor-related activ-\nities and thus could not possibly assist in detecting inves-\ntor fraud.\u201d Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the United\nStates of America as Amicus Curiae 3. See also Brief for\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association as\nAmicus Curiae 7\u201316.\n   There is scant evidence, however, that these floodgate-\nopening concerns are more than hypothetical. DOL\u2019s\nregulations have interpreted \u00a71514A as protecting con-\ntractor employees for almost a decade.15 See 69 Fed. Reg.\n52105\u201352106 (2004). Yet no \u201cnarrower construction\u201d\nadvocate has identified even a single case in which the\nemployee of a private contractor has asserted a \u00a71514A\nclaim based on allegations unrelated to shareholder fraud.\nFMR\u2019s parade of horribles rests solely on Lockheed Martin\nCorp. v. ARB, 717 F. 3d 1121 (CA10 2013), a case involv-\ning mail and wire fraud claims asserted by an employee of\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   15 Although the dissent suggests that the ARB had not provided \u201cde-\n\nfinitive clarification\u201d on the issue prior to Spinner, post at 14, the ARB\n\u201crepeatedly interpreted [\u00a71514A] as affording whistleblower protection\nto employees of [private] contractors\u201d before Spinner. See Spinner, No.\n10\u2013111 etc., ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, p. 5 (citing prior decisions).\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

The dissent\u2019s fears that household employ-\nees and others, on learning of today\u2019s decision, will be\nprompted to pursue retaliation claims, post, at 13, and\nthat OSHA will find them meritorious under \u00a71514A,\nseem to us unwarranted. If we are wrong, however, Con-\ngress can easily fix the problem by amending \u00a71514A\nexplicitly to remove personal employees of public company\nofficers and employees from the provision\u2019s reach. But it\nwould thwart Congress\u2019 dominant aim if contractors were\ntaken off the hook for retaliating against their whistle-\nblowing employees, just to avoid the unlikely prospect that\nbabysitters, nannies, gardeners, and the like will flood\nOSHA with \u00a71514A complaints.\n  Plaintiffs and the Solicitor General observe that over-\nbreadth problems may be resolved by various limit-\ning principles.      They point specifically to the word\n\u201ccontractor.\u201d Plaintiffs note that in \u201ccommon parlance,\u201d\n\u201ccontractor\u201d does not extend to every fleeting business\nrelationship. Instead, the word \u201crefers to a party whose\nperformance of a contract will take place over a significant\nperiod of time.\u201d Reply Brief 16. See also Fleszar v.

Id., at 20 (Government counsel). We agree.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations fall squarely within Congress\u2019 aim in\nenacting \u00a71514A. Lawson alleges that she was construc-\ntively discharged for reporting accounting practices that\noverstated expenses associated with managing certain\nFidelity mutual funds. This alleged fraud directly impli-\ncates the funds\u2019 shareholders: \u201cBy inflating its expenses,\nand thus understating its profits, [FMR] could potentially\nincrease the fees it would earn from the mutual funds, fees\nultimately paid by the shareholders of those funds.\u201d Brief\nfor Petitioners 3. Zang alleges that he was fired for ex-\npressing concerns about inaccuracies in a draft registra-\ntion statement FMR prepared for the SEC on behalf of\ncertain Fidelity funds.

More telling, at the time of the\nDodd-Frank amendments, DOL regulations provided that\n\u00a71514A protects contractor employees.         See 29 CFR\n\u00a71980.101 (2009). Congress included in its alterations no\nlanguage gainsaying that protection.

These distinctions, the Court of\nAppeals reasoned, render \u00a71514A less amenable to an\ninclusive construction of the protected class. Ibid.22\n  We do not find these textual differences overwhelming.\nTrue, Congress strayed from \u00a742121\u2019s pattern in failing to\ndefine \u201ccontractor\u201d for purposes of \u00a71514A, and in adding\n\u201cofficers\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d to \u00a71514A\u2019s list of governed\nactors. And we agree that \u00a71514A covers a far wider\nrange than \u00a742121 does. But in our view, neither differ-\nence warrants the determination that \u00a71514A omits em-\nployees of contractors while \u00a742121 includes them. The\nprovisions\u2019 parallel text and purposes counsel in favor of\ninterpreting the two provisions consistently.

See\nsupra, at 9\u201322.\n                       *     *     *\n  For the reasons stated, we hold that 18 U. S.

S. C.\n\u00a71514A protects employees of private contractors from\nretaliation when they report covered forms of fraud. As\nthe Court carefully demonstrates, that conclusion logically\nflows from \u00a71514A\u2019s text and broader context. I therefore\njoin the Court\u2019s opinion in principal part.\n   I do not endorse, however, the Court\u2019s occasional excur-\nsions beyond the interpretative terra firma of text and\ncontext, into the swamps of legislative history. Reliance\non legislative history rests upon several frail premises.\nFirst, and most important: That the statute means what\nCongress intended. It does not. Because we are a govern-\nment of laws, not of men, and are governed by what\nCongress enacted rather than by what it intended, the sole\nobject of the interpretative enterprise is to determine what\na law says. Second: That there was a congressional \u201cin-\ntent\u201d apart from that reflected in the enacted text. On\nmost issues of detail that come before this Court, I am\nconfident that the majority of Senators and Representa-\ntives had no views whatever on how the issues should be\nresolved\u2014indeed, were unaware of the issues entirely.\nThird: That the views expressed in a committee report or a\n2                       LAWSON v.

Many of them almost certainly did not read the\nreport or hear the statement, much less agree with it\u2014not\nto mention the Members of the other House and the Presi-\ndent who signed the bill.\n   Since congressional \u201cintent\u201d apart from enacted text is\nfiction to begin with, courts understandably allow them-\nselves a good deal of poetic license in defining it. Today\u2019s\nopinion is no exception. It cites parts of the legislative\nrecord that are consistent with its holding that \u00a71514A\ncovers employees of private contractors and subcontrac-\ntors, but it ignores other parts that unequivocally cut in\nthe opposite direction. For example, the following remark\nby the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s lead sponsor in the Senate:\n\u201c[L]et me make very clear that [the Act] applies exclusively\nto public companies\u2014that is, to companies registered\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is not\napplicable to pr[i]v[at]e companies,[*] who make up the\nvast majority of companies across the country.\u201d 148 Cong.\nRec. 14440 (2002) (remarks of Sen. Sarbanes).\n   Two other minor points in the Court\u2019s opinion I do not\nagree with. First, I do not rely on the fact that a separate\nanti-retaliation provision, 49 U. S. C. \u00a742121(a), \u201chas been\nread\u201d by an administrative tribunal to cover contractor\nemployees. Ante, at 29. Section 1514A(b)(2), entitled\n\u201cProcedure,\u201d contains cross-references to the procedural\nrules set forth in \u00a742121(b), but the substantive provisions\nof \u00a71514A(a) are worded quite differently from the sub-\nstantive prohibition of \u00a742121, which is contained in sub-\nsection (a)\u2014thus making interpretation of the latter an\nunreliable guide to \u00a71514A\u2019s meaning. Second, I do not\nagree with the Court\u2019s acceptance of the possible validity\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  * The Congressional Record reads \u201cprovide companies,\u201d but context as\nwell as grammar makes clear that this is a scrivener\u2019s error for \u201cprivate\ncompanies.\u201d\n                   Cite as: 571 U.

Despite\nthese clear markers of intent, the Court does not construe\n\u00a71514A to apply only to public company employees who\nblow the whistle on fraud relating to their public company\nemployers. The Court instead holds that the law encom-\npasses any household employee of the millions of people\nwho work for a public company and any employee of the\nhundreds of thousands of private businesses that contract\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The majority uses the term \u201cpublic company\u201d as shorthand for 18\n\nU.

FMR LLC\n\n                     SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n to perform work for a public company.\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation gives \u00a71514A a stunning\nreach. As interpreted today, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act au-\nthorizes a babysitter to bring a federal case against his\nemployer\u2014a parent who happens to work at the local\nWalmart (a public company)\u2014if the parent stops employ-\ning the babysitter after he expresses concern that the\nparent\u2019s teenage son may have participated in an Internet\npurchase fraud. And it opens the door to a cause of action\nagainst a small business that contracts to clean the local\nStarbucks (a public company) if an employee is demoted\nafter reporting that another nonpublic company client has\nmailed the cleaning company a fraudulent invoice.\n   Congress was of course free to create this kind of sweep-\ning regime that subjects a multitude of individuals and\nprivate businesses to litigation over fraud reports that\nhave no connection to, or impact on, the interests of pub-\nlic company shareholders. But because nothing in the text,\ncontext, or purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggests\nthat Congress actually wanted to do so, I respectfully\ndissent.\n                             I\n   Although the majority correctly starts its analysis with\nthe statutory text, it fails to recognize that \u00a71514A is\ndeeply ambiguous. Three indicators of Congress\u2019 intent\nclearly resolve this ambiguity in favor of a narrower inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A: the statute\u2019s headings, the statutory\ncontext, and the absurd results that follow from the major-\nity\u2019s interpretation.\n                                  A\n    The majority begins its textual analysis by declaring\nthat the \u201c \u2018relevant syntactic elements\u2019 \u201d of \u00a71514A are that\n\u201c \u2018 \u201cno . . . contractor . . . may discharge . . . an employee.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nAnte, at 9.

But \u00a71514A(a) actu-\nally provides that \u201c[n]o [public] company . . . or any officer,\nemployee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent of such\ncompany . . . may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten,\nharass, or in any other manner discriminate against an\nemployee.\u201d The provision thus does not speak only (or\neven primarily) to \u201ccontractors.\u201d It speaks to public com-\npanies, and then includes a list of five types of representa-\ntives that companies hire to carry out their business:\n\u201cofficer[s], employee[s], contractor[s], subcontractor[s],\n[and] agent[s].\u201d\n   Read in full, then, the statute is ambiguous. The major-\nity is correct that it may be read broadly, to create a cause\nof action both for employees of public companies and for\nemployees of the enumerated public company representa-\ntives. But the statute can also be read more narrowly, to\nprohibit the public company and the listed representa-\ntives\u2014all of whom act on the company\u2019s behalf\u2014from\nretaliating against just the public company\u2019s employees.\n   The narrower reading of the text makes particular sense\nwhen one considers the other terms in the list of com-\npany representatives. The majority acknowledges that, as a\nmatter of \u201cgramma[r],\u201d the scope of protected employees\nmust be consistent with respect to all five types of com-\npany representatives listed in \u00a71514A(a). Ante, at 15. Yet\nthe Government and petitioners readily concede that\n\u00a71514A is meant to bar two of the enumerated repre-\nsentatives\u2014\u201cofficer[s]\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d\u2014from retaliating\nagainst other employees of the public company, as opposed\nto their own babysitters and housekeepers.

Fair enough. But Congress could\nmore clearly have dictated the majority\u2019s construction of\nthe statute, too: It could have specified that public compa-\nnies and their officers, employees, contractors, subcontrac-\ntors, and agents may not retaliate against \u201ctheir own\nemployees.\u201d In any case, that Congress could have spoken\nwith greater specificity in both directions only underscores\nthat the words Congress actually chose are ambiguous. To\nresolve this ambiguity, we must rely on other markers of\nintent.\n                             B\n  We have long held that where the text is ambiguous, a\nstatute\u2019s titles can offer \u201ca useful aid in resolving [the]\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n    2 In\n      reaching the opposite conclusion, the majority rejects the conces-\nsions by the Government and petitioners and gives no weight to the\nARB\u2019s interpretation. If \u00a71514A creates a cause of action for contractor\nemployees, the majority concludes, so too must it create a cause of\naction for \u201chousekeepers\u201d and \u201cgardeners\u201d against their individual\nemployers if they happen to work for a public company. Ante, at 15. In\nreaching this result, however, the majority only adds to the absurdities\nproduced by its holding. See infra, at 12\u201313.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

Here, two headings strongly suggest that\nCongress intended \u00a71514A to apply only to employees of\npublic companies. First, the title of \u00a7806\u2014the section of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act that enacted \u00a71514A\u2014speaks\nclearly to the scope of employees protected by the provi-\nsion: \u201cProtection for Employees of Publicly Traded Com-\npanies Who Provide Evidence of Fraud.\u201d 116 Stat. 802.\nSecond, the heading of \u00a71514A(a) reinforces that the pro-\nvision provides \u201c[w]histleblower protection for employees\nof publicly traded companies.\u201d\n   The majority suggests that in covering \u201cemployees of\npublicly traded companies,\u201d the headings may be impre-\ncise. Ante, at 16. Section 1514A(a) technically applies to\nthe employees of two types of companies: those \u201cwith a\nclass of securities registered under section 12 of the Secu-\nrities Exchange Act of 1934,\u201d and those that are \u201crequired\nto file reports under section 15(d) of the\u201d same Act. Both\ntypes of companies are \u201cpublic\u201d in that they are publicly\nowned. See ante, at 7\u20138. The difference is that shares of\nthe \u00a712 companies are listed and traded on a national\nsecurities exchange; \u00a715(d) companies, by contrast, ex-\nchange their securities directly with the public. The head-\nings may therefore be inexact in the sense that the phrase\n\u201cpublicly traded\u201d is commonly associated with companies\nwhose securities are traded on national exchanges. Con-\ngress, however, had good reason to use the phrase to refer\nto \u00a715(d) companies as well: Section 15(d) companies are\ntraded publicly, too. For instance, as the majority recog-\nnizes, ante, at 20, a mutual fund is one paradigmatic\nexample of a \u00a715(d) company. And mutual funds, like\nother \u00a715(d) companies, are both publicly owned and\nwidely traded; the trades just take place typically between\nthe fund and its investors directly.\n   In any case, even if referring to employees of \u00a712 and\n\u00a715(d) companies together as \u201cemployees of publicly traded\n6                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                  SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncompanies\u201d may be slightly imprecise, the majority\u2019s com-\npeting interpretation of \u00a71514A would stretch the stat-\nute\u2019s headings far past the point of recognition. As the\nmajority understands the law, Congress used the term\n\u201cemployees of publicly traded companies\u201d as shorthand not\njust for (1) employees of \u00a712 and \u00a715(d) companies, but\nalso for (2) household employees of any individual who\nworks for a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) company; (3) employees of any\nprivate company that contracts with a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) com-\npany; (4) employees of any private company that, even if\nit does not contract with a public company, subcontracts\nwith a private company that does; and (5) employees of\nany agent of a \u00a712 or \u00a715(d) company. If Congress had\nwanted to enact such a far-reaching provision, it would\nhave called it something other than \u201c[w]histleblower\nprotection for employees of publicly traded companies.\u201d\n    Recognizing that Congress chose headings that are\ninconsistent with its interpretation, the majority notes\nthat the Court has \u201cplaced less weight on captions.\u201d Ante,\nat 16. But where the captions favor one interpretation so\ndecisively, their significance should not be dismissed so\nquickly. As we have explained, headings are important\n\u201c \u2018tools available for the resolution of a doubt\u2019 about the\nmeaning of a statute.\u201d Almendarez-Torres v. United\nStates, 523 U.

Congress stated in the\nAct\u2019s preamble that its objective was to \u201cprotect investors\nby improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate\ndisclosures made pursuant to the securities laws,\u201d 116\nStat. 745, disclosures that public companies alone must\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

The Act thus created enhanced disclosure obligations\nfor public companies, \u00a7401; added new conflict of interest\nrules for their executives, \u00a7402; increased the responsibili-\nties of their audit committees, \u00a7301; and created new rules\ngoverning insider trading by their executives and direc-\ntors, \u00a7306. The common denominator among all of these\nprovisions is their singular focus on the activities of public\ncompanies.\n   When Congress wanted to depart from the Act\u2019s public\ncompany focus to regulate private firms and their employ-\nees, it spoke clearly. For example, \u00a7307 of the Act ordered\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue\nrules \u201csetting forth minimum standards of professional\nconduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the\n[SEC],\u201d including a rule requiring outside counsel to re-\nport violations of the securities laws to public company\nofficers and directors. 15 U.

And Title V required the SEC to adopt rules\ngoverning outside securities analysts when they make\npublic recommendations regarding securities. \u00a778o\u20136.\n   Section 1514A, by contrast, does not unambiguously\ncover the employees of private businesses that contract\nwith public companies or the employees of individuals who\nwork for public companies. Far from it, for the reasons\nnoted above. Yet as the rest of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\ndemonstrates, if Congress had really wanted \u00a71514A to\nimpose liability upon broad swaths of the private sector, it\nwould have said so more clearly.\n   Congress\u2019 intent to adopt the narrower understanding of\n\u00a71514A is also clear when the statute is compared to the\nwhistleblower provision that served as its model. That\nprovision, enacted as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation\n8                    LAWSON v.

But as\nthe majority acknowledges, \u201cCongress strayed\u201d from\n\u00a742121 in significant ways when it wrote \u00a71514A. Ante,\nat 29. First, \u00a742121 specifically defines the term \u201ccon-\ntractor,\u201d limiting the term to \u201ca company that performs\nsafety-sensitive functions by contract for an air carrier.\u201d\n\u00a742121(e). That is in notable distinction to \u00a71514A, which\ndoes not define the word \u201ccontractor\u201d as a particular type\nof company, instead placing the term in a list alongside\nindividual \u201cofficer[s]\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d who act on a\ncompany\u2019s behalf. Second, unlike \u00a742121, \u00a71514A sets off\nthe term \u201ccontractor\u201d in a separate clause that is subsidi-\nary to the primary subject of the provision\u2014the public\ncompany itself. Third, the title of \u00a742121 is \u201c[p]rotection of\nemployees providing air safety information,\u201d a title that\ncomfortably encompasses the employees of contractors.\nNot so of \u00a71514A\u2019s headings, as explained above. In short,\n\u00a742121 shows that Congress had an easy-to-follow model if\nit wanted to protect the employees of contractors, yet\nchose to depart from that model in several important\nways. We should not presume that choice to be accidental.\nSee Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.

The problem is that \u00a71514A does\nnot forbid retaliation by an \u201cemployer\u201d; it forbids retalia-\ntion by a \u201c[public] company . . . or any officer, employee,\ncontractor, subcontractor, or agent of such company.\u201d For\nthe reasons already discussed, Congress could have rea-\nsonably included the five types of representatives not in\ntheir capacity as employers, but rather as representatives\nof the company who are barred from retaliating against a\npublic company\u2019s employees on the company\u2019s behalf.\n   The majority next suggests that contractors are rarely\n\u201cpositioned to take adverse actions against employees of\nthe public company with whom they contract.\u201d Ante, at\n10. That misconceives the nature of modern work forces,\nwhich increasingly comprise a mix of contractors and\npersons laboring under more typical employment relation-\nships. For example, public companies often hire \u201cinde-\npendent contractors,\u201d of whom there are more than 10\nmillion,3 and contract workers,4 of whom there are more\nthan 11 million.5 And they employ outside lawyers, ac-\ncountants, and auditors as well.

Otherwise, the statute would have had a\ngaping hole\u2014a public company could evade \u00a71514A simply\nby hiring a contractor to engage in the very retaliatory\nacts that an officer or employee could not.6\n  The majority also too quickly dismisses the prominence\nof \u201coutplacement\u201d firms, or consultants that help compa-\nnies determine whom to fire.

It surely does, but that is the point\u2014\nthe whole reason \u00a71514A(a) clearly does so is because it expressly\nforbids a public company to retaliate against its employees through\n\u201cany officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor, or agent.\u201d The prohi-\nbition on retaliation through a contractor would be far less certain\n(hence the hole) if Congress had merely forbidden a public company to\nretaliate through its \u201cofficers and employees.\u201d Moreover, while the\nmajority concedes that, under the narrower reading of \u00a71514A, Con-\ngress\u2019 inclusion of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d imposes secondary liability in\nthe event a public company is judgment proof, ante, at 13, the majority\nfails to recognize that Congress\u2019 use of the term also imposes primary\nliability against contractors who threaten public company employees\nwithout direction from the company. Thus, for example, FMR\u2019s inter-\npretation of \u00a71514A would prevent an outside accountant from threat-\nening or harassing a public company employee who discovers that the\naccountant is defrauding the public company and who seeks to blow the\nwhistle on that fraud.\n   7 Rogers, Do Firing Consultants Really Exist, Slate, Jan. 7, 2010,\n\nwww.slate.com / articles / news_and_politics / explainer/2010/01/getting_\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

Ante, at 11, n. 9. The two\nwords are not legally synonymous, however. An outplacement firm and\npublic company might, for example, enter into a contract with a provi-\nsion expressly disclaiming an agency relationship. Moreover, Congress\u2019\nuse of the term \u201ccontractor\u201d would in all events have an independent\nand important effect: If Congress had not included the term, no one\ncould be held liable if a contractor were to threaten or harass a public\ncompany employee without the company\u2019s direction. While the major-\nity may speculate that such occurrences are rare, ibid., it is hardly\nunthinkable. See n. 6, supra.\n12                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nenough for the statute\u2019s remedial scheme to make sense.\nThe majority\u2019s reference to the affirmative defense for\npublic company \u201cemployers\u201d who lack \u201cknowledge\u201d that an\nemployee has participated in a proceeding relating to the\nfraud report, ante, at 12 (citing \u00a71514(A)(a)(2)), fails for a\nsimilar reason. There is no rule that Congress may only\nprovide an affirmative defense if it is available to every\nconceivable defendant.\n                              D\n                              1\n   Finally, the majority\u2019s reading runs afoul of the precept\nthat \u201cinterpretations of a statute which would produce\nabsurd results are to be avoided if alternative interpreta-\ntions consistent with the legislative purpose are avail-\nable.\u201d Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564,\n575 (1982). The majority\u2019s interpretation transforms\n\u00a71514A into a sweeping source of litigation that Congress\ncould not have intended. As construed by the majority,\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulates employment relation-\nships between individuals and their nannies, housekeep-\ners, and caretakers, subjecting individual employers to\nlitigation if their employees claim to have been harassed\nfor providing information regarding any of a host of of-\nfenses. If, for example, a nanny is discharged after ex-\npressing a concern to his employer that the employer\u2019s\nteenage son may be participating in some Internet fraud,\nthe nanny can bring a \u00a71514A suit. The employer may\nprevail, of course, if the nanny cannot prove he was fired\n\u201cbecause of\u201d the fraud report. \u00a71514A. But there is little\nreason to think Congress intended to sweep such disputes\ninto federal court.\n   Nor is it plausible that Congress intended the Act to\nimpose costly litigation burdens on any private business\nthat happens to have an ongoing contract with a public\ncompany.

Yet the majority might well embroil\nfederal agencies and courts in the resolution of mundane\nlabor disputes that have nothing to do with such concerns.\nFor instance, a construction worker could file a \u00a71514A\nsuit against her employer (that has a long-term contract\nwith a public company) if the worker is demoted after\nreporting that another client has mailed the company a\nfalse invoice.9\n   The majority\u2019s interpretation also produces truly odd\ndistinctions. Under the rule it announces, a babysitter\ncan bring a \u00a71514A retaliation suit against his employer\nif his employer is a checkout clerk for the local PetSmart\n(a public company), but not if she is a checkout clerk for the\nlocal Petco (a private company). Likewise, the day laborer\nwho works for a construction business can avail himself of\n\u00a71514A if her company has been hired to help remodel the\nlocal Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods store (a public company), but\nnot if it is remodeling a nearby Sports Authority (a private\ncompany).\n   In light of the reasonable alternative reading of \u00a71514A,\nthere is no reason to accept these absurd results. The\nmajority begs to differ, arguing that \u201c[t]here is scant evi-\ndence\u201d that lawsuits have been brought by the multitude\nof newly covered employees \u201c \u2018who have no exposure to\ninvestor-related activities and thus could not possibly\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  9 Recognizing that the majority\u2019s reading would lead to a \u201cnotably\n\nexpansive scope untethered to the purpose of the statute,\u201d the District\nCourt in this case sought to impose an extratextual limiting principle\nunder which an employee who reports fraud is entitled to protection\nonly if her report \u201crelat[es] to fraud against shareholders.\u201d </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

The District Court acknowledged,\nhowever, that \u201cthe language of the statute itself does not plainly\nprovide such a limiting principle,\u201d id., at 158, and the majority does not\nattempt to revive that limitation here.\n14                  LAWSON v.

Until\ntoday, however, no court has deemed \u00a71514A applicable to\nhousehold employees of individuals who work for public\ncompanies; even the Department of Labor\u2019s ARB rejected\nthat view. Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, at 8. And as\nthe District Court noted, prior to the ARB\u2019s 2012 decision\nin Spinner, the ARB \u201cha[d] yet to provide . . . definitive\nclarification\u201d on the question whether \u00a71514A extends to\nthe employees of a public company\u2019s private contractors.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (Mass. 2010). So the fact that\nindividuals and private businesses have yet to suffer\nburdensome litigation offers little assurance that the ma-\njority\u2019s capacious reading of \u00a71514A will produce no un-\ntoward effects.\n  Finally, it must be noted that \u00a71514A protects the re-\nporting of a variety of frauds\u2014not only securities fraud,\nbut also mail, wire, and bank fraud. By interpreting a\nstatute that already protects an expansive class of conduct\nalso to cover a large class of employees, today\u2019s opinion\nthreatens to subject private companies to a costly new\nfront of employment litigation. Congress almost certainly\ndid not intend the statute to have that reach.\n                             2\n   The majority argues that the broader reading of \u00a71514A\nis necessary because a small number of the millions of\nindividuals and private companies affected by its ruling\nhave a special role to play in preventing public company\nfraud. If \u00a71514A does not bar retaliation against employ-\nees of contractors, the majority cautions, then law firms\nand accounting firms will be free to retaliate against their\nemployees when those employees report fraud on the part\nof their public company clients.\n   It is undisputed that Congress was aware of the role\nthat outside accountants and lawyers played in the Enron\ndebacle and the importance of encouraging them to play\n                  Cite as: 571 U.

But it hardly\nfollows that Congress must have meant to apply \u00a71514A to\nevery employee of every public company contractor, sub-\ncontractor, officer, and employee as a result. It is far more\nlikely that Congress saw the unique ethical duties and\nprofessional concerns implicated by outside lawyers and\naccountants as reason to vest regulatory authority in the\nhands of experts with the power to sanction wrongdoers.\n   Specifically, rather than imposing \u00a71514A\u2019s generic\napproach on outside accounting firms, Congress estab-\nlished the PCAOB, which regulates \u201cevery detail\u201d of an\naccounting firm\u2019s practice, including \u201csupervision of au-\ndit work,\u201d \u201cinternal inspection procedures,\u201d \u201cprofessional\nethics rules,\u201d and \u201c \u2018such other requirements as the Board\nmay prescribe.\u2019 \u201d Free Enterprise Fund v.

Such sanc-\ntions could well provide a more powerful incentive to\nprevent an accounting firm from retaliating against its\nemployees than \u00a71514A.\n   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act confers similar regulatory\nauthority upon the SEC with respect to attorneys. The\nAct requires the SEC to establish rules of professional\nconduct for attorneys, \u00a7307 (codified at 15 U. S. C. \u00a77245),\nand confers broad power on the SEC to punish attorneys\nfor \u201cimproper professional conduct,\u201d which would include,\nfor example, a law firm partner\u2019s decision to retaliate\nagainst an associate who reports fraud. \u00a7602 (codified at\n15 U. S. C. \u00a778d\u20133). Indeed, the Act grants the SEC the\npower to censure culpable attorneys and to deny \u201cperma-\nnently\u201d to any such attorney the \u201cprivilege of appearing of\npracticing before\u201d the SEC \u201cin any way.\u201d \u00a7602.\n16                      LAWSON v.

Such judgment\nshould not be disturbed under usual circumstances, much\nless at the cost to congressional intent produced by today\u2019s\nruling. The majority does offer cogent policy arguments\nfor why Congress might have been wiser to include certain\ntypes of contractors within \u00a71514A, noting for example\nthat a law firm or accounting firm might be able to retali-\nate against its employees for making reports required\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

But as the\nmajority recognizes, Congress has since remedied that\nprecise concern, enacting a comprehensive whistleblower\nincentive and protection program that unequivocally\n\u201cprohibit[s] any employer\u201d\u2014public or private\u2014\u201cfrom re-\ntaliating against \u2018a whistleblower\u2019 for providing infor-\nmation to the SEC, participating in an SEC proceeding, or\nmaking disclosures required or protected under Sarbanes-\nOxley and certain other securities laws.\u201d Ante, at 26\n(citing 15 U.

According to\npetitioners, the ARB\u2019s rulings are entitled to deference\nbecause the \u201cSecretary is responsible for enforcing Section\n1514A both through investigation and through formal\nadjudication.\u201d Brief for Petitioners 61. That is right as far\nas it goes, but even if the Secretary has the power to in\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a780b\u201311. The Act also authorizes fines and imprisonment of up to five\nyears for violations of SEC rules. The SEC thus has broad discretion to\npunish retaliatory actions taken by mutual fund advisers against their\nemployees. And to the extent these provisions may have been insuffi-\ncient to protect mutual fund adviser employees, \u00a778u\u20136\u2019s extensive\nwhistleblower incentive and protection program now unambiguously\ncovers such employees.\n   11 Although it claims not to reach the issue, ante, at 9, n. 6, the major-\n\nity implicitly declines to defer to a portion of the ARB\u2019s ruling as well,\nrejecting the ARB\u2019s ruling that \u00a71514A does not apply to the household\nemployees of public company officers and employees, ante, at 15, and\nn. 11.\n18                   LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nvestigate and adjudicate \u00a71514A claims, Congress did not\ndelegate authority to the Secretary to \u201cmake rules carry-\ning the force of law,\u201d Mead, 533 U. S., at 226\u2013227. Con-\ngress instead delegated that power to the SEC: Section\n3(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, codified at 15 U. S. C.\n\u00a77202(a), provides that the SEC \u201cshall promulgate such\nrules and regulations, as may be necessary or appropriate\nin the public interest or for the protection of investors, and\nin furtherance of this Act.\u201d So if any agency has the au-\nthority to resolve ambiguities in \u00a71514A with the force\nof law, it is the SEC, not the Department of Labor.\nSee Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review\nComm\u2019n, 499 U. S. 144, 154 (1991). The SEC, however, has\nnot issued a regulation applying \u00a71514A whistleblower\nprotection to employees of public company contractors.\nAnd while the majority notes that the SEC may share the\n(incorrect) view that the Department of Labor has inter-\npretive authority regarding \u00a71514A, ante, at 9, n. 6, the\nmajority cites nothing to suggest that one agency may\ntransfer authority unambiguously delegated to it by Con-\ngress to a different agency simply by signing onto an\namicus brief.\n   That Congress did not intend for the Secretary to re-\nsolve ambiguities in the law is confirmed by \u00a71514A\u2019s\nmechanism for judicial review. The statute does not merely\npermit courts to review the Secretary\u2019s final adjudicatory\nrulings under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s defer-\nential standard. It instead allows a claimant to bring an\naction in a federal district court, and allows district courts\nto adjudicate such actions de novo, in any case where the\nSecretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days.\nThat is a conspicuously short amount of time in light of\nthe three-tiered process of agency review of \u00a71514A\nclaims. See ante, at 5\u20136. As a result, even if Congress had\nnot delegated to the SEC the authority to resolve ambigui-\nties in \u00a71514A, the muscular scheme of judicial review\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          19\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nsuggests that Congress would have wanted federal courts,\nand not the Secretary of Labor, to have that power. See\nMead, 533 U. S., at 232 (declining to defer to Customs\nService classifications where, among other things, the\nstatute authorized \u201cindependent review of Customs classi-\nfications by the [Court of International Trade]\u201d).\n   As to the second Mead requirement, even if Congress\nhad delegated authority to the Secretary to make \u201crules\ncarrying the force of law,\u201d the \u201cagency interpretation\nclaiming deference\u201d in this case was not \u201cpromulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.\u201d Id., at 226\u2013227. That is\nbecause the Secretary has explicitly vested any policymak-\ning authority he may have with respect to \u00a71514A in the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)\ninstead of the ARB. See 67 Fed. Reg. 65008 (2002). In\nfact, the Secretary has expressly withdrawn from the ARB\nany power to deviate from the rules OSHA issues on the\nDepartment of Labor\u2019s behalf. 75 Fed. Reg. 3925 (\u201cThe\n[ARB] shall not have jurisdiction to pass on the validity of\nany portion of the Code of Federal Regulations that has\nbeen duly promulgated by the Department of Labor and\nshall observe the provisions thereof, where pertinent, in\nits decisions\u201d).\n   OSHA has promulgated regulations supporting the\nmajority\u2019s reading of \u00a71514A. See 29 CFR \u00a71980.101(f )\u2013(g)\n(2013). The Secretary, however, has expressly disclaimed\nany claim of deference to them. See Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 33, n. 8. As a result, the ARB\u2019s\nunderstanding of \u00a71514A\u2019s coverage in Spinner was not an\n\u201cexercise of [the Secretary\u2019s] authority\u201d to make rules\ncarrying the force of law, Mead, 533 U. S., at 226\u2013227, but\nrather the ARB\u2019s necessary compliance with a regulation\nthat no one claims is deserving of deference in the first\nplace. See Spinner, ALJ No. 2010\u2013SOX\u2013029, at 10 (recog-\nnizing that \u201cthe ARB is bound by the [Department of\nLabor] regulations\u201d).\n20                  LAWSON v. FMR LLC\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  In the absence of Chevron deference, the ARB\u2019s decision\nin Spinner may claim only \u201crespect according to its per-\nsuasiveness\u201d under Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S.\n134 (1944). See Mead, 533 U. S., at 221. But the ARB\u2019s\ndecision is unpersuasive, for the many reasons already\ndiscussed.\n                        *    *     *\n   The Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a71514A undeniably serves\na laudatory purpose. By covering employees of every of-\nficer, employee, and contractor of every public company,\nthe majority\u2019s interpretation extends \u00a71514A\u2019s protections\nto the outside lawyers and accountants who could have\nhelped prevent the Enron fraud.\n   But that is not the statute Congress wrote. Congress\nenvisioned a system in which public company employees\nwould be covered by \u00a71514A, and in which outside law-\nyers, investment advisers, and accountants would be\nregulated by the SEC and PCAOB. Congress did not\nenvision a system in which employees of other private\nbusinesses\u2014such as cleaning and construction company\nworkers who have little interaction with investor-related\nactivities and who are thus ill suited to assist in detecting\nfraud against shareholders\u2014would fall within \u00a71514A.\nNor, needless to say, did it envision \u00a71514A applying to\nthe household employees of millions of individuals who\nhappen to work for public companies\u2014housekeepers,\ngardeners, and babysitters who are also poorly positioned\nto prevent fraud against public company investors. And to\nthe extent \u00a71514A may have been underinclusive as first\ndrafted, Congress has shown itself capable of filling in any\ngaps. See, e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-\nsumer Protection Act, \u00a7\u00a7922, 929A, 124 Stat. 1848, 1852\n(extending \u00a71514A to credit rating agencies and public\ncompany subsidiaries); \u00a7922, id., at 1841\u20131848 (codifying\nadditional whistleblower incentive and protection program\n                     Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)                   21\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nat 15 U. S. C. \u00a778u\u20136).\n  The Court\u2019s decision upsets the balance struck by Con-\ngress. Fortunately, just as Congress has added further\nprotections to the system it originally designed when\nnecessary, so too may Congress now respond to limit the\nfar-reaching implications of the Court\u2019s interpretation.12\nBut because that interpretation relies on a debatable view\nof \u00a71514A\u2019s text, is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s titles\nand its context, and leads to absurd results that Congress\ndid not intend, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  12 Congress could, for example, limit \u00a71514A to contractor employees\n\nin only those professions that can assist in detecting fraud on public\ncompany shareholders, or it could restrict the fraud reports that trigger\nwhistleblower protection to those that implicate the interests of public\ncompany investors, see n. 9, supra.\n</pre>",
