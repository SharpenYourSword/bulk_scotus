SIEGEL, CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 12\u20135196. Argued January 13, 2014\u2014Decided March 4, 2014\nPetitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He valued his Califor-\n  nia home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was cov-\n  ered by California\u2019s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from\n  the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A). He also\n  claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens\u2014one of which was in fa-\n  vor of \u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage & Associates\u201d\u2014exceeded the home\u2019s nonex-\n  empt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors. Re-\n  spondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the \u201cLin\u201d\n  lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litiga-\n  tion ensued when a supposed \u201cLili Lin\u201d in China claimed to be the\n  beneficiary of Law\u2019s deed of trust. Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court\n  concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his\n  equity in the house. It thus granted Siegel\u2019s motion to \u201csurcharge\u201d\n  Law\u2019s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to\n  defray attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law\u2019s fraudu-\n  lent misrepresentations. The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n  Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when\n it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law\u2019s homestead exemption\n be made available to pay Siegel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Pp. 5\u201312.\n     (a) A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to \u201ccarry out\u201d\n the provisions of the Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7105(a), or its \u201cinherent power\n . . . to sanction \u2018abusive litigation practices,\u2019 \u201d Marrama v. Citizens\n Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375\u2013376, by taking action prohibited\n elsewhere in the Code. Here, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \u201csurcharge\u201d\n contravened \u00a7522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law\n to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate,\n \u00a7522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 \u201cnot liable for payment of\n2                              LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                                   Syllabus\n\n    any administrative expense,\u201d \u00a7522(k), including attorney\u2019s fees, see\n    \u00a7503(b)(2). The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court\u2019s\n    authority under \u00a7105(a) and its inherent powers. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by\n    \u201csurcharging\u201d exempt property in response to a debtor\u2019s misconduct\n    can coexist with \u00a7522. But insofar as that argument equates the sur-\n    charge with an outright denial of Law\u2019s homestead exemption, it\n    founders on this case\u2019s procedural history. The Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the home-\n    stead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.\n    And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge\n    an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643\u2013644.\n    Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law\u2019s entitle-\n    ment to the exemption, \u00a7522 specifies the criteria that render proper-\n    ty exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor\u2019s invocation\n    of an exemption without a valid statutory basis. Federal courts may\n    apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law\n    itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemp-\n    tion on a ground not specified in the Code. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (c) Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum\n    points toward a different result. There, the debtor\u2019s bad faith kept\n    him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a\n    Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by \u00a7706(a). But that was be-\n    cause his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13,\n    and thus he could not satisfy \u00a7706(d), which expressly conditions\n    conversion on the debtor\u2019s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.\n    Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (d) This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden\n    due to Law\u2019s egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable re-\n    sults for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter\n    the balance that Congress struck in crafting \u00a7522.

ALFRED H. SIEGEL,\n             CHAPTER 7 TRUSTEE\n\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\n            APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n                                 [March 4, 2014]\n\n  JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor may ex\u00ad\nempt certain assets from the bankruptcy estate. It further\nprovides that exempt assets generally are not liable for\nany expenses associated with administering the estate. In\nthis case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court none\u00ad\ntheless may order that a debtor\u2019s exempt assets be used to\npay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the\ndebtor\u2019s misconduct.\n                                I. Background\n                              A\n  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent\ndebtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidat\u00ad\ning his assets to pay his creditors. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1),\n726, 727. The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chap\u00ad\nter 7 creates a bankruptcy \u201cestate\u201d generally comprising\nall of the debtor\u2019s property. \u00a7541(a)(1). The estate is\nplaced under the control of a trustee, who is responsible\nfor managing liquidation of the estate\u2019s assets and distri\u00ad\nbution of the proceeds. \u00a7704(a)(1). The Code authorizes\n2                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debtor to \u201cexempt,\u201d however, certain kinds of property\nfrom the estate, enabling him to retain those assets post\u00ad\nbankruptcy. \u00a7522(b)(1). Except in particular situations\nspecified in the Code, exempt property \u201cis not liable\u201d for\nthe payment of \u201cany [prepetition] debt\u201d or \u201cany adminis\u00ad\ntrative expense.\u201d \u00a7522(c), (k).\n   Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemp\u00ad\ntions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.\n\u00a7522(b)(2), (d). One, commonly known as the \u201chomestead\nexemption,\u201d protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debt\u00ad\nor\u2019s residence. \u00a7522(d)(1) and note following \u00a7522; see\nOwen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). The debtor may\nelect, however, to forgo the \u00a7522(d) exemptions and in\u00ad\nstead claim whatever exemptions are available under\napplicable state or local law. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A). Some States\nprovide homestead exemptions that are more generous\nthan the federal exemption; some provide less generous\nversions; but nearly every State provides some type of\nhomestead exemption. See L\u00f3pez, State Homestead Ex\u00ad\nemptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To\nClose the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L. J. 143, 149\u2013165\n(2010) (listing state exemptions).\n                             B\n  Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed\nto serve as trustee. The estate\u2019s only significant asset was\nLaw\u2019s house in Hacienda Heights, California. On a sched\u00ad\nule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the\nhouse at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value\nwas covered by California\u2019s homestead exemption. See\nCal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7704.730(a)(1) (West Supp.\n2014). He also reported that the house was subject to two\nvoluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in\nfavor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and\ndeed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of \u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociates.\u201d Law thus represented that there was no\nequity in the house that could be recovered for his other\ncreditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the\nhouse\u2019s nonexempt value.\n   If Law\u2019s representations had been accurate, he presum\u00ad\nably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel\nwould have had no reason to pursue its sale. Instead, a\nfew months after Law\u2019s petition was filed, Siegel initiated\nan adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of\n\u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage & Associates\u201d was fraudulent. The deed\nof trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in\n1999 and reflected a debt to someone named \u201cLili Lin.\u201d\nNot one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ulti\u00ad\nmately responded to Siegel\u2019s complaint. One, Lili Lin of\nArtesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law\u2019s\nwho denied ever having loaned him money and described\nhis repeated efforts to involve her in various sham trans\u00ad\nactions relating to the disputed deed of trust. That Lili\nLin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaim\u00ad\ning any interest in the house. But that was not the end of\nthe matter, because the second \u201cLili Lin\u201d claimed to be the\ntrue beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust. Over the\nnext five years, this \u201cLili Lin\u201d managed\u2014despite suppos\u00ad\nedly living in China and speaking no English\u2014to engage\nin extensive and costly litigation, including several ap\u00ad\npeals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and\nSiegel\u2019s subsequent sale of the house.\n   Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order\nconcluding that \u201cno person named Lili Lin ever made a\nloan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.\u201d\nIn re Law, 401 B. R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.). The\ncourt found that \u201cthe loan was a fiction, meant to preserve\n[Law\u2019s] equity in his residence beyond what he was enti\u00ad\ntled to exempt\u201d by perpetrating \u201ca fraud on his creditors\nand the court.\u201d Ibid. With regard to the second \u201cLili Lin,\u201d\nthe court declared itself \u201cunpersuaded that Lili Lin of\n4                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChina signed or approved any declaration or pleading\npurporting to come from her.\u201d Ibid. Rather, it said, the\n\u201cmost plausible conclusion\u201d was that Law himself had\n\u201cauthored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.\u201d\nIbid. It also found that Law had submitted false evidence\n\u201cin an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China\u2014\nrather than Lili Lin of Artesia\u2014was the true holder of the\nlien on his residence.\u201d Id., at 452. The court determined\nthat Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney\u2019s\nfees overcoming Law\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations. It\ntherefore granted Siegel\u2019s motion to \u201csurcharge\u201d the en\u00ad\ntirety of Law\u2019s $75,000 homestead exemption, making\nthose funds available to defray Siegel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.\n   The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.\nBAP No. CC\u201309\u20131077\u2013PaMkH, 2009 WL 7751415 (Oct.\n22, 2009) ( per curiam). It held that the Bankruptcy\nCourt\u2019s factual findings regarding Law\u2019s fraud were not\nclearly erroneous and that the court had not abused its\ndiscretion by surcharging Law\u2019s exempt assets. It ex\u00ad\nplained that in Latman v. Burdette, 366 F. 3d 774 (2004),\nthe Ninth Circuit had recognized a bankruptcy court\u2019s\npower to \u201cequitably surcharge a debtor\u2019s statutory ex\u00ad\nemptions\u201d in exceptional circumstances, such as \u201cwhen a\ndebtor engages in inequitable or fraudulent conduct.\u201d 2009\nWL 7751415, *5, *7. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\nacknowledged that the Tenth Circuit had disagreed with\nLatman, see In re Scrivner, 535 F. 3d 1258, 1263\u20131265\n(2008), but the panel affirmed that Latman was correct.\n2009 WL 7751415, *7, n. 10. Judge Markell filed a con\u00ad\ncurring opinion agreeing with the panel\u2019s application of\nLatman but questioning \u201cwhether Latman remains good\npolicy.\u201d 2009 WL 7751415, *10.\n   The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In re Law, 435 Fed. Appx.\n697 (2011) ( per curiam). It held that the surcharge was\nproper because it was \u201ccalculated to compensate the estate\nfor the actual monetary costs imposed by the debtor\u2019s\n                     Cite as: 571 U.

We granted certiorari.\n570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II. Analysis\n                              A\n   A bankruptcy court has statutory authority to \u201cissue\nany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or ap\u00ad\npropriate to carry out the provisions of \u201d the Bankruptcy\nCode. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7105(a). And it may also possess \u201cinher\u00ad\nent power . . . to sanction \u2018abusive litigation practices.\u2019 \u201d\nMarrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375\u2013\n376 (2007). But in exercising those statutory and inherent\npowers, a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific\nstatutory provisions.\n   It is hornbook law that \u00a7105(a) \u201cdoes not allow the\nbankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other\nsections of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d 2 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b6105.01[2], p. 105\u20136 (16th ed. 2013). Section 105(a) con\u00ad\nfers authority to \u201ccarry out\u201d the provisions of the Code, but\nit is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the\nCode prohibits. That is simply an application of the axiom\nthat a statute\u2019s general permission to take actions of a\ncertain type must yield to a specific prohibition found\nelsewhere. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550\u2013551\n(1974); D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n206\u2013208 (1932).1 Courts\u2019 inherent sanctioning powers are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The second sentence of \u00a7105(a) adds little to the analysis. It states:\n\n\u201cNo provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a\nparty in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,\nsua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary\nor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to\nprevent an abuse of process.\u201d Even if the \u201cabuse of process\u201d language\nwere deemed to confer additional authority beyond that conferred by\nthe first sentence (which is doubtful), that general authority would also\nbe limited by more specific provisions of the Code.\n6                          LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlikewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and\nprohibitions. Degen v. United States, 517 U. S. 820, 823\n(1996); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991).\nWe have long held that \u201cwhatever equitable powers\nremain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be\nexercised within the confines of \u201d the Bankruptcy Code.\nNorwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197, 206\n(1988); see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530\nU. S. 15, 24\u201325 (2000); United States v. Noland, 517 U. S.\n535, 543 (1996); SEC v.

Section 522 (by reference to\nCalifornia law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity\nin his home from the bankruptcy estate. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A).\nAnd it made that $75,000 \u201cnot liable for payment of any\nadministrative expense.\u201d \u00a7522(k).2 The reasonable attor\u00ad\nney\u2019s fees Siegel incurred defeating the \u201cLili Lin\u201d lien were\nindubitably an administrative expense, as a short march\nthrough a few statutory cross-references makes plain:\nSection 503(b)(2) provides that administrative expenses\ninclude \u201ccompensation . . . awarded under\u201d \u00a7330(a);\n\u00a7330(a)(1) authorizes \u201creasonable compensation for actual,\nnecessary services rendered\u201d by a \u201cprofessional person\nemployed under\u201d \u00a7327; and \u00a7327(a) authorizes the trustee\nto \u201cemploy one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist\nthe trustee in carrying out the trustee\u2019s duties under this\ntitle.\u201d Siegel argues that even though attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred responding to a debtor\u2019s fraud qualify as \u201cadmin\u00ad\nistrative expenses\u201d for purposes of determining the trus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The statute\u2019s general rule that exempt assets are not liable for\n\nadministrative expenses is subject to two narrow exceptions, both per\u00ad\ntaining to the use of exempt assets to pay expenses associated with the\navoidance of certain voidable transfers of exempt property. \u00a7522(k)(1)\u2013\n(2). Neither of those exceptions is relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 571 U.

See Depart-\nment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n332, 342 (1994) (quoting Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury,\n475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986)).\n   The Bankruptcy Court thus violated \u00a7522\u2019s express\nterms when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law\u2019s\nhomestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s fees, an administrative expense. In doing so,\nthe court exceeded the limits of its authority under \u00a7105(a)\nand its inherent powers.\n                             B\n   Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s \u00a7105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised\nin contravention of the Code. Instead, his main argument\nis that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s surcharge did not contra\u00ad\nvene \u00a7522. That statute, Siegel contends, \u201cestablish[es]\nthe procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemp\u00ad\ntions\u201d but \u201ccontains no directive requiring [courts] to allow\n[an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 35. Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable\npower in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by\n\u201csurcharging\u201d the exempt property in response to the\ndebtor\u2019s misconduct can coexist comfortably with \u00a7522.\nThe United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees,\narguing that \u00a7522 \u201cneither gives debtors an absolute right\nto retain exempt property nor limits a court\u2019s authority to\nimpose an equitable surcharge on such property.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s surcharge with an outright denial of\nLaw\u2019s homestead exemption, their arguments founder\n8                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nupon this case\u2019s procedural history. The Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel stated that because no one \u201ctimely op\u00ad\npose[d] [Law]\u2019s homestead exemption claim,\u201d the exemp\u00ad\ntion \u201cbecame final\u201d before the Bankruptcy Court imposed\nthe surcharge. 2009 WL 7751415, at *2. We have held\nthat a trustee\u2019s failure to make a timely objection prevents\nhim from challenging an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643\u2013644 (1992).\n   But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have\nrevisited Law\u2019s entitlement to the exemption, \u00a7522 does\nnot give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions\nbased on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.\nRather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that\nwill render property exempt. See \u00a7522(b), (d). Siegel\ninsists that because \u00a7522(b) says that the debtor \u201cmay\nexempt\u201d certain property, rather than that he \u201cshall be\nentitled\u201d to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or\ndeny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.\nBut the subject of \u201cmay exempt\u201d in \u00a7522(b) is the debtor,\nnot the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests\ndiscretion. A debtor need not invoke an exemption to\nwhich the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court\nmay not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid\nstatutory basis for doing so.\n   Moreover, \u00a7522 sets forth a number of carefully cali\u00ad\nbrated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to\nthe debtor\u2019s misconduct. For example, \u00a7522(c) makes\nexempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition\ndebts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in\nconnection with student loans, and other specified types of\nwrongdoing. Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claim\u00ad\ning a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the\nhomestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10\nyears \u201cwith the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a credi\u00ad\ntor.\u201d And \u00a7522(q) caps a debtor\u2019s homestead exemption at\napproximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntirely) where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that\nshows \u201cthat the filing of the case was an abuse of the\nprovisions of \u201d the Code, or where the debtor owes a debt\narising from specified wrongful acts\u2014such as securities\nfraud, civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act, or \u201cany criminal act, inten\u00ad\ntional tort, or willful or reckless misconduct that caused\nserious physical injury or death to another individual\nin the preceding 5 years.\u201d \u00a7522(q) and note following\n\u00a7522. The Code\u2019s meticulous\u2014not to say mind-numbingly\ndetailed\u2014enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to\nthose exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized\nto create additional exceptions. See Hillman v. Maretta,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28\u201329 (2001).\n   Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed\nauthority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from\namending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is\nmuch the same thing) based on the debtor\u2019s fraudulent\nconcealment of the asset alleged to be exempt. See, e.g.,\nIn re Yonikus, 996 F. 2d 866, 872\u2013873 (CA7 1993); In re\nDoan, 672 F. 2d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) ( per curiam); Stew-\nart v. Ganey, 116 F. 2d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940). He sug\u00ad\ngests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable\npower in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a\ndebtor\u2019s bad-faith conduct. For the reasons we have given,\nthe Bankruptcy Code admits no such power. It is of course\ntrue that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption,\nthe exemption\u2019s scope is determined by state law, which\nmay provide that certain types of debtor misconduct war\u00ad\nrant denial of the exemption. E.g., In re Sholdan, 217\nF. 3d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b6522.08[1]\u2013[2], at 522\u201345 to 522\u201347. Some of the early\ndecisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts\napplied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.\n10                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee In re Denson, 195 F. 857, 858 (ND Ala. 1912); Cowan\nv. Burchfield, 180 F. 614, 619 (ND Ala. 1910); In re Ansley\nBros., 153 F. 983, 984 (EDNC 1907). But federal law\nprovides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an\nexemption on a ground not specified in the Code.\n                             C\n   Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which\nSiegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point\ntoward a different result. The question there was whether\na debtor\u2019s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bank\u00ad\nruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy\nfrom a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization\nunder Chapter 13. Although \u00a7706(a) of the Code gave the\ndebtor a right to convert the case, \u00a7706(d) \u201cexpressly\nconditioned\u201d that right on the debtor\u2019s \u201cability to qualify as\na \u2018debtor\u2019 under Chapter 13.\u201d 549 U. S., at 372. And\n\u00a71307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13\ncould be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding\n\u201cfor cause,\u201d which the Court interpreted to authorize\ndismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct. In light of\n\u00a71307(c), the Court held that the debtor\u2019s bad faith could\nstop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13,\nthus preventing him from satisfying \u00a7706(d)\u2019s express\ncondition on conversion. Id., at 372\u2013373. That holding\nhas no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law\nfailed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his\nclaiming of the homestead exemption.\n   True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s refusal to convert the case was authorized\nunder \u00a7105(a) and might have been authorized under the\ncourt\u2019s inherent powers. Id., at 375\u2013376. But even that\ndictum does not support Siegel\u2019s position. In Marrama,\nthe Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to\nChapter 13, \u00a71307(c) would have required it to be either\ndismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debt\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor\u2019s bad faith. Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s refusal to convert the case had not\nbeen expressly authorized by \u00a7706(d), that action could\nhave been justified as a way of providing a \u201cprompt, rather\nthan a delayed, ruling on [the debtor\u2019s] unmeritorious at\u00ad\ntempt to qualify\u201d under \u00a71307(c). Id., at 376. At most,\nMarrama\u2019s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a\nbankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with\nfutile procedural niceties in order to reach more expedi\u00ad\ntiously an end result required by the Code. Marrama\nmost certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view\nthat equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to\ncontravene express provisions of the Code.\n                             D\n   We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoul\u00ad\nder a heavy financial burden resulting from Law\u2019s egre\u00ad\ngious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable\nresults for trustees and creditors in other cases. We have\nrecognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of\n\u00a7522, \u201cCongress balanced the difficult choices that exemp\u00ad\ntion limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that\nexemptions visit on creditors.\u201d Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). The same can be said of the limits im\u00ad\nposed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.\nFor the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to\nalter the balance struck by the statute. Cf. Guidry v.\nSheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365,\n376\u2013377 (1990).\n                        *     *     *\n   Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts\nof the essential \u201cauthority to respond to debtor misconduct\nwith meaningful sanctions.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17. There is ample authority to deny the\ndishonest debtor a discharge. See \u00a7727(a)(2)\u2013(6). (That\n12                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition\nsettlement between Siegel and Law\u2019s major creditor, Law\nhas no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be\nthe case.) In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro\u00ad\ncedure 9011\u2014bankruptcy\u2019s analogue to Civil Rule 11\u2014\nauthorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith\nlitigation conduct, which may include \u201can order directing\npayment. . . of some or all of the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\nand other expenses incurred as a direct result of the viola\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2). The court may\nalso possess further sanctioning authority under either\n\u00a7105(a) or its inherent powers. Cf. Chambers, 501 U. S.,\nat 45\u201349. And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case\nand is thereafter enforceable through the normal proce\u00ad\ndures for collecting money judgments. See \u00a7727(b). Fraud\u00ad\nulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor\nto criminal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7152, which\ncarries a maximum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n   But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may\nimpose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene ex\u00ad\npress provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that\nthe debtor\u2019s exempt property be used to pay debts and\nexpenses for which that property is not liable under the\nCode.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n",

Argued January 13, 2014\u2014Decided March 4, 2014\nPetitioner Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He valued his Califor-\n  nia home at $363,348, claiming that $75,000 of that value was cov-\n  ered by California\u2019s homestead exemption and thus was exempt from\n  the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U. S. C. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A). He also\n  claimed that the sum of two voluntary liens\u2014one of which was in fa-\n  vor of \u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage & Associates\u201d\u2014exceeded the home\u2019s nonex-\n  empt value, leaving no equity recoverable for his other creditors. Re-\n  spondent Siegel, the bankruptcy estate trustee, challenged the \u201cLin\u201d\n  lien in an adversary proceeding, but protracted and expensive litiga-\n  tion ensued when a supposed \u201cLili Lin\u201d in China claimed to be the\n  beneficiary of Law\u2019s deed of trust. Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court\n  concluded that the loan was a fiction created by Law to preserve his\n  equity in the house. It thus granted Siegel\u2019s motion to \u201csurcharge\u201d\n  Law\u2019s $75,000 homestead exemption, making those funds available to\n  defray attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Siegel in overcoming Law\u2019s fraudu-\n  lent misrepresentations. The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate\n  Panel and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The Bankruptcy Court exceeded the limits of its authority when\n it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law\u2019s homestead exemption\n be made available to pay Siegel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Pp. 5\u201312.\n     (a) A bankruptcy court may not exercise its authority to \u201ccarry out\u201d\n the provisions of the Code, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7105(a), or its \u201cinherent power\n . . . to sanction \u2018abusive litigation practices,\u2019 \u201d Marrama v. Citizens\n Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375\u2013376, by taking action prohibited\n elsewhere in the Code. Here, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \u201csurcharge\u201d\n contravened \u00a7522, which (by reference to California law) entitled Law\n to exempt $75,000 of equity in his home from the bankruptcy estate,\n \u00a7522(b)(3)(A), and which made that $75,000 \u201cnot liable for payment of\n2                              LAW v.

The surcharge thus exceeded the limits of both the court\u2019s\n    authority under \u00a7105(a) and its inherent powers. Pp. 5\u20137.\n       (b) Siegel argues that an equitable power to deny an exemption by\n    \u201csurcharging\u201d exempt property in response to a debtor\u2019s misconduct\n    can coexist with \u00a7522. But insofar as that argument equates the sur-\n    charge with an outright denial of Law\u2019s homestead exemption, it\n    founders on this case\u2019s procedural history. The Bankruptcy Appellate\n    Panel recognized that because no one timely objected to the home-\n    stead exemption, it became final before the surcharge was imposed.\n    And a trustee who fails to make a timely objection cannot challenge\n    an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643\u2013644.\n    Assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have revisited Law\u2019s entitle-\n    ment to the exemption, \u00a7522 specifies the criteria that render proper-\n    ty exempt, and a court may not refuse to honor a debtor\u2019s invocation\n    of an exemption without a valid statutory basis. Federal courts may\n    apply state law to disallow state-created exemptions, but federal law\n    itself provides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an exemp-\n    tion on a ground not specified in the Code. Pp. 7\u201310.\n       (c) Neither the holding of Marrama v. Citizens Bank nor its dictum\n    points toward a different result. There, the debtor\u2019s bad faith kept\n    him from converting his bankruptcy from a Chapter 7 liquidation to a\n    Chapter 13 reorganization as permitted by \u00a7706(a). But that was be-\n    cause his conduct prevented him from qualifying under Chapter 13,\n    and thus he could not satisfy \u00a7706(d), which expressly conditions\n    conversion on the debtor\u2019s ability to qualify under Chapter 13.\n    Pp. 10\u201311.\n       (d) This ruling forces Siegel to shoulder a heavy financial burden\n    due to Law\u2019s egregious misconduct and may produce inequitable re-\n    sults for other trustees and creditors, but it is not for courts to alter\n    the balance that Congress struck in crafting \u00a7522.

In\nthis case, we consider whether a bankruptcy court none\u00ad\ntheless may order that a debtor\u2019s exempt assets be used to\npay administrative expenses incurred as a result of the\ndebtor\u2019s misconduct.\n                                I. Background\n                              A\n  Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code gives an insolvent\ndebtor the opportunity to discharge his debts by liquidat\u00ad\ning his assets to pay his creditors. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(1),\n726, 727. The filing of a bankruptcy petition under Chap\u00ad\nter 7 creates a bankruptcy \u201cestate\u201d generally comprising\nall of the debtor\u2019s property. \u00a7541(a)(1). The estate is\nplaced under the control of a trustee, who is responsible\nfor managing liquidation of the estate\u2019s assets and distri\u00ad\nbution of the proceeds. \u00a7704(a)(1). The Code authorizes\n2                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe debtor to \u201cexempt,\u201d however, certain kinds of property\nfrom the estate, enabling him to retain those assets post\u00ad\nbankruptcy. \u00a7522(b)(1). Except in particular situations\nspecified in the Code, exempt property \u201cis not liable\u201d for\nthe payment of \u201cany [prepetition] debt\u201d or \u201cany adminis\u00ad\ntrative expense.\u201d \u00a7522(c), (k).\n   Section 522(d) of the Code provides a number of exemp\u00ad\ntions unless they are specifically prohibited by state law.\n\u00a7522(b)(2), (d). One, commonly known as the \u201chomestead\nexemption,\u201d protects up to $22,975 in equity in the debt\u00ad\nor\u2019s residence. \u00a7522(d)(1) and note following \u00a7522; see\nOwen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 310 (1991). The debtor may\nelect, however, to forgo the \u00a7522(d) exemptions and in\u00ad\nstead claim whatever exemptions are available under\napplicable state or local law. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A). Some States\nprovide homestead exemptions that are more generous\nthan the federal exemption; some provide less generous\nversions; but nearly every State provides some type of\nhomestead exemption. See L\u00f3pez, State Homestead Ex\u00ad\nemptions and Bankruptcy Law: Is It Time for Congress To\nClose the Loophole? 7 Rutgers Bus. L. J. 143, 149\u2013165\n(2010) (listing state exemptions).\n                             B\n  Petitioner, Stephen Law, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin 2004, and respondent, Alfred H. Siegel, was appointed\nto serve as trustee. The estate\u2019s only significant asset was\nLaw\u2019s house in Hacienda Heights, California. On a sched\u00ad\nule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Law valued the\nhouse at $363,348 and claimed that $75,000 of its value\nwas covered by California\u2019s homestead exemption. See\nCal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7704.730(a)(1) (West Supp.\n2014). He also reported that the house was subject to two\nvoluntary liens: a note and deed of trust for $147,156.52 in\nfavor of Washington Mutual Bank, and a second note and\ndeed of trust for $156,929.04 in favor of \u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage &\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAssociates.\u201d Law thus represented that there was no\nequity in the house that could be recovered for his other\ncreditors, because the sum of the two liens exceeded the\nhouse\u2019s nonexempt value.\n   If Law\u2019s representations had been accurate, he presum\u00ad\nably would have been able to retain the house, since Siegel\nwould have had no reason to pursue its sale. Instead, a\nfew months after Law\u2019s petition was filed, Siegel initiated\nan adversary proceeding alleging that the lien in favor of\n\u201cLin\u2019s Mortgage & Associates\u201d was fraudulent. The deed\nof trust supporting that lien had been recorded by Law in\n1999 and reflected a debt to someone named \u201cLili Lin.\u201d\nNot one but two individuals claiming to be Lili Lin ulti\u00ad\nmately responded to Siegel\u2019s complaint. One, Lili Lin of\nArtesia, California, was a former acquaintance of Law\u2019s\nwho denied ever having loaned him money and described\nhis repeated efforts to involve her in various sham trans\u00ad\nactions relating to the disputed deed of trust. That Lili\nLin promptly entered into a stipulated judgment disclaim\u00ad\ning any interest in the house. But that was not the end of\nthe matter, because the second \u201cLili Lin\u201d claimed to be the\ntrue beneficiary of the disputed deed of trust. Over the\nnext five years, this \u201cLili Lin\u201d managed\u2014despite suppos\u00ad\nedly living in China and speaking no English\u2014to engage\nin extensive and costly litigation, including several ap\u00ad\npeals, contesting the avoidance of the deed of trust and\nSiegel\u2019s subsequent sale of the house.\n   Finally, in 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order\nconcluding that \u201cno person named Lili Lin ever made a\nloan to [Law] in exchange for the disputed deed of trust.\u201d\nIn re Law, 401 B. R. 447, 453 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Cal.). The\ncourt found that \u201cthe loan was a fiction, meant to preserve\n[Law\u2019s] equity in his residence beyond what he was enti\u00ad\ntled to exempt\u201d by perpetrating \u201ca fraud on his creditors\nand the court.\u201d Ibid. With regard to the second \u201cLili Lin,\u201d\nthe court declared itself \u201cunpersuaded that Lili Lin of\n4                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nChina signed or approved any declaration or pleading\npurporting to come from her.\u201d Ibid. Rather, it said, the\n\u201cmost plausible conclusion\u201d was that Law himself had\n\u201cauthored, signed, and filed some or all of these papers.\u201d\nIbid. It also found that Law had submitted false evidence\n\u201cin an effort to persuade the court that Lili Lin of China\u2014\nrather than Lili Lin of Artesia\u2014was the true holder of the\nlien on his residence.\u201d Id., at 452. The court determined\nthat Siegel had incurred more than $500,000 in attorney\u2019s\nfees overcoming Law\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations. It\ntherefore granted Siegel\u2019s motion to \u201csurcharge\u201d the en\u00ad\ntirety of Law\u2019s $75,000 homestead exemption, making\nthose funds available to defray Siegel\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.\n   The Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed.\nBAP No. CC\u201309\u20131077\u2013PaMkH, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7751415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Oct.\n22, 2009) ( per curiam).

It ex\u00ad\nplained that in Latman v.

We granted certiorari.\n570 U. S. ___ (2013).\n                             II. Analysis\n                              A\n   A bankruptcy court has statutory authority to \u201cissue\nany order, process, or judgment that is necessary or ap\u00ad\npropriate to carry out the provisions of \u201d the Bankruptcy\nCode. 11 U. S. C. \u00a7105(a). And it may also possess \u201cinher\u00ad\nent power . . . to sanction \u2018abusive litigation practices.\u2019 \u201d\nMarrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U. S. 365, 375\u2013\n376 (2007). But in exercising those statutory and inherent\npowers, a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific\nstatutory provisions.\n   It is hornbook law that \u00a7105(a) \u201cdoes not allow the\nbankruptcy court to override explicit mandates of other\nsections of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d 2 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b6105.01[2], p. 105\u20136 (16th ed. 2013). Section 105(a) con\u00ad\nfers authority to \u201ccarry out\u201d the provisions of the Code, but\nit is quite impossible to do that by taking action that the\nCode prohibits. That is simply an application of the axiom\nthat a statute\u2019s general permission to take actions of a\ncertain type must yield to a specific prohibition found\nelsewhere. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 550\u2013551\n(1974); D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U. S. 204,\n206\u2013208 (1932).1 Courts\u2019 inherent sanctioning powers are\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  1 The second sentence of \u00a7105(a) adds little to the analysis. It states:\n\n\u201cNo provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a\nparty in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,\nsua sponte, taking any action or making any determination necessary\nor appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules, or to\nprevent an abuse of process.\u201d Even if the \u201cabuse of process\u201d language\nwere deemed to confer additional authority beyond that conferred by\nthe first sentence (which is doubtful), that general authority would also\nbe limited by more specific provisions of the Code.\n6                          LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nlikewise subordinate to valid statutory directives and\nprohibitions. Degen v. United States, 517 U. S. 820, 823\n(1996); Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 47 (1991).\nWe have long held that \u201cwhatever equitable powers\nremain in the bankruptcy courts must and can only be\nexercised within the confines of \u201d the Bankruptcy Code.\nNorwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U. S. 197, 206\n(1988); see, e.g., Raleigh v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 530\nU. S. 15, 24\u201325 (2000); United States v. Noland, 517 U. S.\n535, 543 (1996); SEC v. United States Realty & Improve-\nment Co., 310 U. S. 434, 455 (1940).\n   Thus, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s \u201csurcharge\u201d was unau\u00ad\nthorized if it contravened a specific provision of the Code.\nWe conclude that it did. Section 522 (by reference to\nCalifornia law) entitled Law to exempt $75,000 of equity\nin his home from the bankruptcy estate. \u00a7522(b)(3)(A).\nAnd it made that $75,000 \u201cnot liable for payment of any\nadministrative expense.\u201d \u00a7522(k).2 The reasonable attor\u00ad\nney\u2019s fees Siegel incurred defeating the \u201cLili Lin\u201d lien were\nindubitably an administrative expense, as a short march\nthrough a few statutory cross-references makes plain:\nSection 503(b)(2) provides that administrative expenses\ninclude \u201ccompensation . . . awarded under\u201d \u00a7330(a);\n\u00a7330(a)(1) authorizes \u201creasonable compensation for actual,\nnecessary services rendered\u201d by a \u201cprofessional person\nemployed under\u201d \u00a7327; and \u00a7327(a) authorizes the trustee\nto \u201cemploy one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist\nthe trustee in carrying out the trustee\u2019s duties under this\ntitle.\u201d Siegel argues that even though attorney\u2019s fees\nincurred responding to a debtor\u2019s fraud qualify as \u201cadmin\u00ad\nistrative expenses\u201d for purposes of determining the trus\u00ad\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  2 The statute\u2019s general rule that exempt assets are not liable for\n\nadministrative expenses is subject to two narrow exceptions, both per\u00ad\ntaining to the use of exempt assets to pay expenses associated with the\navoidance of certain voidable transfers of exempt property. \u00a7522(k)(1)\u2013\n(2). Neither of those exceptions is relevant here.\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntee\u2019s right to reimbursement under \u00a7503(b), they do not so\nqualify for purposes of \u00a7522(k); but he gives us no reason\nto depart from the \u201c \u2018normal rule of statutory construc\u00ad\ntion\u2019 \u201d that words repeated in different parts of the same\nstatute generally have the same meaning. See Depart-\nment of Revenue of Ore. v. ACF Industries, Inc., 510 U. S.\n332, 342 (1994) (quoting Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury,\n475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986)).\n   The Bankruptcy Court thus violated \u00a7522\u2019s express\nterms when it ordered that the $75,000 protected by Law\u2019s\nhomestead exemption be made available to pay Siegel\u2019s\nattorney\u2019s fees, an administrative expense. In doing so,\nthe court exceeded the limits of its authority under \u00a7105(a)\nand its inherent powers.\n                             B\n   Siegel does not dispute the premise that a bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s \u00a7105(a) and inherent powers may not be exercised\nin contravention of the Code. Instead, his main argument\nis that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s surcharge did not contra\u00ad\nvene \u00a7522. That statute, Siegel contends, \u201cestablish[es]\nthe procedure by which a debtor may seek to claim exemp\u00ad\ntions\u201d but \u201ccontains no directive requiring [courts] to allow\n[an exemption] regardless of the circumstances.\u201d Brief for\nRespondent 35. Thus, he says, recognition of an equitable\npower in the Bankruptcy Court to deny an exemption by\n\u201csurcharging\u201d the exempt property in response to the\ndebtor\u2019s misconduct can coexist comfortably with \u00a7522.\nThe United States, appearing in support of Siegel, agrees,\narguing that \u00a7522 \u201cneither gives debtors an absolute right\nto retain exempt property nor limits a court\u2019s authority to\nimpose an equitable surcharge on such property.\u201d Brief\nfor United States as Amicus Curiae 23.\n   Insofar as Siegel and the United States equate the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s surcharge with an outright denial of\nLaw\u2019s homestead exemption, their arguments founder\n8                      LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nupon this case\u2019s procedural history. The Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel stated that because no one \u201ctimely op\u00ad\npose[d] [Law]\u2019s homestead exemption claim,\u201d the exemp\u00ad\ntion \u201cbecame final\u201d before the Bankruptcy Court imposed\nthe surcharge. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">7751415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2. We have held\nthat a trustee\u2019s failure to make a timely objection prevents\nhim from challenging an exemption. Taylor v. Freeland &\nKronz, 503 U. S. 638, 643\u2013644 (1992).\n   But even assuming the Bankruptcy Court could have\nrevisited Law\u2019s entitlement to the exemption, \u00a7522 does\nnot give courts discretion to grant or withhold exemptions\nbased on whatever considerations they deem appropriate.\nRather, the statute exhaustively specifies the criteria that\nwill render property exempt. See \u00a7522(b), (d). Siegel\ninsists that because \u00a7522(b) says that the debtor \u201cmay\nexempt\u201d certain property, rather than that he \u201cshall be\nentitled\u201d to do so, the court retains discretion to grant or\ndeny exemptions even when the statutory criteria are met.\nBut the subject of \u201cmay exempt\u201d in \u00a7522(b) is the debtor,\nnot the court, so it is the debtor in whom the statute vests\ndiscretion. A debtor need not invoke an exemption to\nwhich the statute entitles him; but if he does, the court\nmay not refuse to honor the exemption absent a valid\nstatutory basis for doing so.\n   Moreover, \u00a7522 sets forth a number of carefully cali\u00ad\nbrated exceptions and limitations, some of which relate to\nthe debtor\u2019s misconduct. For example, \u00a7522(c) makes\nexempt property liable for certain kinds of prepetition\ndebts, including debts arising from tax fraud, fraud in\nconnection with student loans, and other specified types of\nwrongdoing. Section 522(o) prevents a debtor from claim\u00ad\ning a homestead exemption to the extent he acquired the\nhomestead with nonexempt property in the previous 10\nyears \u201cwith the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a credi\u00ad\ntor.\u201d And \u00a7522(q) caps a debtor\u2019s homestead exemption at\napproximately $150,000 (but does not eliminate it en\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)           9\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntirely) where the debtor has been convicted of a felony that\nshows \u201cthat the filing of the case was an abuse of the\nprovisions of \u201d the Code, or where the debtor owes a debt\narising from specified wrongful acts\u2014such as securities\nfraud, civil violations of the Racketeer Influenced and\nCorrupt Organizations Act, or \u201cany criminal act, inten\u00ad\ntional tort, or willful or reckless misconduct that caused\nserious physical injury or death to another individual\nin the preceding 5 years.\u201d \u00a7522(q) and note following\n\u00a7522. The Code\u2019s meticulous\u2014not to say mind-numbingly\ndetailed\u2014enumeration of exemptions and exceptions to\nthose exemptions confirms that courts are not authorized\nto create additional exceptions. See Hillman v. Maretta,\n569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 12); TRW Inc. v.\nAndrews, 534 U. S. 19, 28\u201329 (2001).\n   Siegel points out that a handful of courts have claimed\nauthority to disallow an exemption (or to bar a debtor from\namending his schedules to claim an exemption, which is\nmuch the same thing) based on the debtor\u2019s fraudulent\nconcealment of the asset alleged to be exempt. See, e.g.,\nIn re Yonikus, 996 F. 2d 866, 872\u2013873 (CA7 1993); In re\nDoan, 672 F. 2d 831, 833 (CA11 1982) ( per curiam); Stew-\nart v. Ganey, 116 F. 2d 1010, 1011 (CA5 1940). He sug\u00ad\ngests that those decisions reflect a general, equitable\npower in bankruptcy courts to deny exemptions based on a\ndebtor\u2019s bad-faith conduct. For the reasons we have given,\nthe Bankruptcy Code admits no such power. It is of course\ntrue that when a debtor claims a state-created exemption,\nthe exemption\u2019s scope is determined by state law, which\nmay provide that certain types of debtor misconduct war\u00ad\nrant denial of the exemption. E.g., In re Sholdan, 217\nF. 3d 1006, 1008 (CA8 2000); see 4 Collier on Bankruptcy\n\u00b6522.08[1]\u2013[2], at 522\u201345 to 522\u201347. Some of the early\ndecisions on which Siegel relies, and which the Fifth Cir\u00ad\ncuit cited in Stewart, are instances in which federal courts\napplied state law to disallow state-created exemptions.\n10                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nSee In re Denson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (ND Ala. 1912); Cowan\nv.

But federal law\nprovides no authority for bankruptcy courts to deny an\nexemption on a ground not specified in the Code.\n                             C\n   Our decision in Marrama v. Citizens Bank, on which\nSiegel and the United States heavily rely, does not point\ntoward a different result. The question there was whether\na debtor\u2019s bad-faith conduct was a valid basis for a bank\u00ad\nruptcy court to refuse to convert the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy\nfrom a liquidation under Chapter 7 to a reorganization\nunder Chapter 13. Although \u00a7706(a) of the Code gave the\ndebtor a right to convert the case, \u00a7706(d) \u201cexpressly\nconditioned\u201d that right on the debtor\u2019s \u201cability to qualify as\na \u2018debtor\u2019 under Chapter 13.\u201d 549 U. S., at 372. And\n\u00a71307(c) provided that a proceeding under Chapter 13\ncould be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding\n\u201cfor cause,\u201d which the Court interpreted to authorize\ndismissal or conversion for bad-faith conduct. In light of\n\u00a71307(c), the Court held that the debtor\u2019s bad faith could\nstop him from qualifying as a debtor under Chapter 13,\nthus preventing him from satisfying \u00a7706(d)\u2019s express\ncondition on conversion. Id., at 372\u2013373. That holding\nhas no relevance here, since no one suggests that Law\nfailed to satisfy any express statutory condition on his\nclaiming of the homestead exemption.\n   True, the Court in Marrama also opined that the Bank\u00ad\nruptcy Court\u2019s refusal to convert the case was authorized\nunder \u00a7105(a) and might have been authorized under the\ncourt\u2019s inherent powers. Id., at 375\u2013376. But even that\ndictum does not support Siegel\u2019s position. In Marrama,\nthe Court reasoned that if the case had been converted to\nChapter 13, \u00a71307(c) would have required it to be either\ndismissed or reconverted to Chapter 7 in light of the debt\u00ad\n                 Cite as: 571 U. S. ____ (2014)          11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nor\u2019s bad faith. Therefore, the Court suggested, even if the\nBankruptcy Court\u2019s refusal to convert the case had not\nbeen expressly authorized by \u00a7706(d), that action could\nhave been justified as a way of providing a \u201cprompt, rather\nthan a delayed, ruling on [the debtor\u2019s] unmeritorious at\u00ad\ntempt to qualify\u201d under \u00a71307(c). Id., at 376. At most,\nMarrama\u2019s dictum suggests that in some circumstances a\nbankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with\nfutile procedural niceties in order to reach more expedi\u00ad\ntiously an end result required by the Code. Marrama\nmost certainly did not endorse, even in dictum, the view\nthat equitable considerations permit a bankruptcy court to\ncontravene express provisions of the Code.\n                             D\n   We acknowledge that our ruling forces Siegel to shoul\u00ad\nder a heavy financial burden resulting from Law\u2019s egre\u00ad\ngious misconduct, and that it may produce inequitable\nresults for trustees and creditors in other cases. We have\nrecognized, however, that in crafting the provisions of\n\u00a7522, \u201cCongress balanced the difficult choices that exemp\u00ad\ntion limits impose on debtors with the economic harm that\nexemptions visit on creditors.\u201d Schwab v. Reilly, 560 U. S.\n770, 791 (2010). The same can be said of the limits im\u00ad\nposed on recovery of administrative expenses by trustees.\nFor the reasons we have explained, it is not for courts to\nalter the balance struck by the statute. Cf. Guidry v.\nSheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365,\n376\u2013377 (1990).\n                        *     *     *\n   Our decision today does not denude bankruptcy courts\nof the essential \u201cauthority to respond to debtor misconduct\nwith meaningful sanctions.\u201d Brief for United States as\nAmicus Curiae 17. There is ample authority to deny the\ndishonest debtor a discharge. See \u00a7727(a)(2)\u2013(6). (That\n12                     LAW v. SIEGEL\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsanction lacks bite here, since by reason of a postpetition\nsettlement between Siegel and Law\u2019s major creditor, Law\nhas no debts left to discharge; but that will not often be\nthe case.) In addition, Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Pro\u00ad\ncedure 9011\u2014bankruptcy\u2019s analogue to Civil Rule 11\u2014\nauthorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith\nlitigation conduct, which may include \u201can order directing\npayment. . . of some or all of the reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\nand other expenses incurred as a direct result of the viola\u00ad\ntion.\u201d Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(c)(2). The court may\nalso possess further sanctioning authority under either\n\u00a7105(a) or its inherent powers. Cf. Chambers, 501 U. S.,\nat 45\u201349. And because it arises postpetition, a bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case\nand is thereafter enforceable through the normal proce\u00ad\ndures for collecting money judgments. See \u00a7727(b). Fraud\u00ad\nulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor\nto criminal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7152, which\ncarries a maximum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment.\n   But whatever other sanctions a bankruptcy court may\nimpose on a dishonest debtor, it may not contravene ex\u00ad\npress provisions of the Bankruptcy Code by ordering that\nthe debtor\u2019s exempt property be used to pay debts and\nexpenses for which that property is not liable under the\nCode.\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n                                             It is so ordered.\n</pre>",
